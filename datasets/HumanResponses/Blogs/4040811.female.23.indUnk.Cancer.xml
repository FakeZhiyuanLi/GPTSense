      Hello,  First here is some information:  1.)I am in the process of trying to get some pictures up here but it is difficult; my computer does not want to cooperate. But I am trying so hopefully pics to come!  2.)Also for all of those who do not know this Sunday is the Alpha Marchdown. It is the biggest stepshow in St. Louis. Other Greeks have tried to hold a show, but none have been as successful as this. It is always a great show. We are the reigning champs! That's right Blue and White Sweep last year and this year to big baby! All of this is to say if you have nothing better to do and are in the St. Louis area check it out. Heck if you are out of town..ROAD TRIP! Tickets are on sale at From One Greek To Another on Delmar and they sell them at the door. My advice is to just get the VIP ticket. It includes the show, dinner and the after party. The whole event takes place on the campus of University of Missouri-St. Louis (which is my alma mater shout out to UMSL). If you need more info go to my profile and email me:)  3.)I have recieved feedback that when you try to comment on the page it tries to make you sign up to have your own blog page! Sorry it does that but to bypass all of that just leave a message anonymously and put your name in the body of your post! You can still just always go to my profile and email me...  Now to the real deal,  So my last detailed post was about the club. In which post I stated that I was going to stay out of the club circuit for about six months. (about the needed healing time) Well this morning I heard an advertisment about grown folks Friday at Spruills. It is 23 and up! What! No young bucks in Air Force Ones! We might have something here. So one day I will go there. Not today though because it is raining. The next time I go anywhere it has to be clear and sunny skies.  The funny thing about Spruills is that it is a banquet hall. When did the banquet hall turn into the club? Some of us know how to pull a hustle... During the day it is Rolanda's beauty salon but at 8pm it becomes the new concert venue!  The last time I was at Spruills I was, oh about 16 years old and I was there for my ROTC military banquet! This is just too ironic for me.  So if you have ever been to Spruills let me know...Is it even worth the gas that I will burn to get there?  God Bless, Raquel

      I have gotten a lot of feedback on my post, Where the heck am I, but I have yet to get a comment here. Leave your comments here or, email them to me. I will ask for permission to post them then I will post them right here for everyone to read! Exciting I know!   Now my co-worker Alandrea went to the club last week with me as well and also had quite an experience. She valet her car at&nbsp;the club because we got the hook up on it.  (Hook-up: can be a noun or verb-to get free or get a discount on. In this case it was free)  I could have gotten&nbsp;valet but I had already parked and just decided to forget it because my friend and I parked right around the corner.   So when Al decides to leave, the guy who valet her car could not find her keys! He pulled a whole bunch of keys out of his pocket and asked her which keys belonged to her. She ended up having to go outside in the rain to help him look for them. Now I will admit that I do not know a lot about valet but from what I see on TV there should be a box, a cabinet of sort, to house the keys that you have acquired. Your pocket, not very professional.   We need to improve people, we need to improve.   God Bless,  Raquel

      Ok,   So now for my second post I will get to it. I will get the party started like the Black Eye Peas. I will talk about a subject that I have expressed to a few of my friends in St. Louis and we all agree.   When did the club life in ST. LOUIS MO turn in to New York.   I mean come on. I know we trying to come up but my Goodness! This is getting out of hand and needs to be addressed.   Let me just tell you about how I remember club life: (note: never a big clubber per say, but I did attend a few B.C.* when I turned 18 and thought I was too grown)&nbsp;&nbsp;  9:00am decide that I am going to go to the club with the girls  12:00 noon: go to mall to get outfit or get matching pieces to items that I already own&nbsp;in an attempt to make something funky happen. I have generally seen this outfit in my mind and now I will try to bring it to life.  6:00 pm go to sleep  9:00 pm wake up and prepare for the club by showering, doing hair, makeup, and purse change (can be done in car if your are running out of time)  10:30pm leave for the club or friends house if I am driving  11:00-11:15pm arrive at club  Now pay close attention here:  After arrival at the club I exit vehicle and walk to the door. Show my ID go to the cashier, pay and go into the club and commence getting my party on!   Clubs in 2004 post Nelly, post Chingy, have gotten out of control! These club owners and bouncers think they are God or something and tend to treat you how the hell ever.   Now when you go to the club, you can get to the club after 10:30 if you bad, but you will be waiting in line. I ABSOLUTELY HATE LINES AT THE CLUB. This comes from a bad experience on my friend Candice's birthday where we waited in line&nbsp;FOR ONE HOUR and did not get in!&nbsp;I did not get dressed up in heals to stand outside, sometimes in the rain. Oh no! You got me confused with that other girl over there. Call me stuck up if ya want to! I am just stating my opinion.   Ok, let me calm down. But last week was the worst.  I go to the club right. I have to get there at 10pm-10:15 to avoid the line. Even if you get there and there is no line that make you stand there like Boo boo the fool just because they can. Then they let you in but you are there all extra early and then the music don't get right until about 12:00. I don't drink anymore so I usually just sit there with a water and look at what people have on.   My second issue with the club is how crazy crowded it is! It is scary&nbsp;crowded.&nbsp;It is if&nbsp;some dropped a cigarette we would all die crowded because no one would have a prayer of making it to the exit. Quit letting all these people in! If you want all those people in here expand, open the back door to the alley or&nbsp;something! I go to the club to dance, I have no room to do it, I paid to get in, and&nbsp;I am not a satisfied customer.   Let me speak to the manager.....  Hello. Because I did not have adequate room to shake my behind, I need a refund.   Then when I am ready to leave, it is pouring down rain.&nbsp;Now there are all these bouncers at the door and they all have umbrellas but are not offering to escort anyone to the car! SO I got completely drenched so much so I had to wash my hair. It looked like I had been the shower. I was SO not happy.   Well that is it for me and the club for I would guess somewhere around another six months. It will take a while to forget about this one. I think I will be hanging out at the A's: AMC and AMF.   Thank you for allowing me to vent, more stories about my three times to the club this month to come!   God Bless,  Raquel   * B.C. stands for Before Christ was a big part of my life.

      Well!&nbsp;&nbsp;To all of you I say welcome to my world!   To all that don't know me my name is Raquel. I am a 23 year old college graduate currently residing in St. Louis Missouri.   University of Missouri-St. Louis!   I am also a proud member of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Inc!   I have to state why I finally decided to do this:   Well I read a lot of these things and I find the stories absolutely hilarious. I question myself am I witty and creative enough to maintain something like this? Is my life exciting enough? Do people give a care what I think about things in the world? Well there is only one way to find out.   Please feel free to comment on any post you chose. I welcome all suggestions and opinions!   I think that this is enough for one post, expect another latter today or tomorrow!   God Bless,  Raquel

      Hello Everybody, I have to take this time to issue a disclaimer:  In this here post I will make many comments towards men that may be construed as a little angry. I am not a bitter Black woman; this post is meant for entertainment purposes and not to offend anyone. Reading this post may cause women to yell "that’s right" and "uh huh girl, you better say that". It also may cause men to feel picked on or targeted. Please read w/caution.   Now maybe about a week ago I ran into one of my old boyfriends. I don't even know if you can call it boyfriend or girlfriend given that I was all of 13 years old in the eight grade at the time. The relationship lasted exactly one week. I found out he was cheating on me so I started this rumor that I was talking to someone else too so he would break up with me. I used to have a serious problem with breaking up with people so I would do things to get them to dump me. I know, I needed professional help, I know. So after this break up, we just went back to being friends.  So I had not saw this guy for about 3 years or so until about a week ago. I am sitting on my porch talking to my boy Justin (Hi Justin!) on the phone and he walks up and says Raquel? Now it is pretty dark out at this time so I say, "Who is that dar?" And he says his name and I get off the phone and give him a hug. He is like, "dang you look good, and you lost weight?" He then bends over to tie his shoe and says, "Dang you got some pretty feet." So I am like ok, you are quite the little charmer. Not that I did not like it; every girl likes a compliment... several is a bonus. So he asked me if I was single and I said yes, and he asked could he call me and I was like cool, and I gave him my number.  He called me about a week latter and was like can I come over. I said cool. Now when it is someone coming over and I don't have to leave the house, I don't put on clothes until they get there. So I eventually fall asleep and he never shows up.  So maybe a couple days after that he calls and is like can I come over tonight I am sorry about last night. I say cool and eventually fall asleep and he never shows.  So last Monday he calls and says sorry I have been busy, In the studio (I won't even get into this), can I come over latter and bring you a CD, I say cool and end up leaving to go somewhere and he never showed because he never called.  So last night, he calls when I am on my way from Bible study and was like” Where you at"..."I am in the car"....."Where in the car"....."on 367"....."Oh man I am at your house now"....."Well wait, I will be there in about 10 minutes"....."I can't I be on the move man! I have a stop to make a run in Berkley and I will be right back".... I start to laugh and say sure. Of course he never called back.  Now Even though I could care less what he does, one phrase did kind of make me upset. "I be on the move man! What the heck is that? Like I am not on the move. I have a job, a workout schedule, a church I attend regularly on Sunday and during the week, plus family, friends, sorority business, etc. Now if I can be where I say I am going to be when I say I am going to be there, surly you who has no job, church, sorority, workout schedule, just family and friends can be there. I am just telling it like it TI is.  MEN, yes I am talking to some of you, wants us to always understand. But you don't understand. We have lives too. I know it might not seem like it because we answer the phone when you call and do things like come over your house to visit, when you want us to, when we are dead tired. Because we are available to take you to work when your car is down, there to rub your back when you are sick, angry and frustrated and accompany you to parties, family reunions, funerals, and always manage to look great on your arm. You want to know why we do this men, because when we care about you, WE MAKE YOU A PRIORITY IN OUR LIVES. That’s right! We move you to the top of the list. All I am asking for is the same treatment that you expect...that’s all.  All I am saying is think about it. Do you right now, and this can go for men and women, have someone who just thinks you are the cats meow and you play them to the left and off the cliff?Shame isn't it.  SO then I am talking to my friend Justin again about this and I said" I am not really worried about it because it is not like I could ever have a relationship w/ dude we are on two different pages. He would only be good for talking to, hearing him compliment me and rub my feet." He made it sound like I was wrong. What do you think people based on what I have told you about him? Let me know if I am evil.  God Bless Raquel

      Hello All!  Yes, Yes We won again. The Zeta Ladies are just BADDDD! Oh my goodness! No Blue and White Sweep though, the Sigmas did not win, but I am still ecstatic about my sorors though. Just beware that this is going to be a long post, but very very entertaining:)  So, this years show was by far the best show that I have been to, and I counted this week and this is my 6th year going! I am getting so old. Everyone stepped except for the Omega's which kind of shocked me because they always step. The Sigma Gamma Rho's opened the show. They had a 70's... old school theme, you get the picture. They had a good show, very high energy and very difficult steps. They did really well.  Then it was time for the main event! Here is what the people came to see! Ha Ha! (In case you do not know me, I talk much trash about sports, my sorority, my church, just about anything I am passionate about.) Our theme was a court case. Pure genius if you ask me. It started with a powerpoint show where it stated that the ladies of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. have been accused of theft of stepshows and strolls, something we deny and tonight, you will be the judge. Then the powerpoint introduced the judge and the prosecutor Ivy D. Poodle. Then it introduced us. I can't even remember the song that we came out on but it was hype! I was so excited! I was in the VIP section with a whole lot of sorors and we were screaming! It was great. There show was so hot, not one mistake, steps were difficult, they held the theme the entire show and it made it interesting. I was so proud.  Then it was the Delta's turn. Now at first I was a little frightened because it was like 30 of them stepping and they came out hype too. But then they had no theme they were just out there doing there thing. It got kind of old to look at. They wore casual boots w/no heel or tap so it made their steps sound too clunky and not precise and crisp. At the end I was no longer worried:)  The AKA's, well again they came out hype. They had no theme as well, made about two or three mistakes....We had this puppy in the bag! I knew we won by the intermission. No need to even wait on the judges.  Now here is why I think that we always win. WE ALWAYS HAVE A THEME. A theme is essential to keeping your show interesting. Stepshows are about entertainment, and a plot of some kind entertains. It shows creativity and that you put in a lot of effort. Anyone can put a step together and perform it but, to come up with a theme, get clothes, costumes and props to fit your theme, takes effort and work. Plus your want to maximize all your point categories and those creativity and originality points can go a long way. If you have a theme you have to carry it through the whole show. You can't just have an intro theme; it will make your show start out hot but get cold at the end like so many other shows did.  The men I will sum up here: The Kappa's won, there show was good. The Iota's stepped they did this step with knives and two of the guys threw the knives out at the judges instead of down and one of the knives hit the Delta judge. (She was not injured though)  Now during the show I sat on the 1st row of the balcony in the center (I got there an hour early for those seats). I sat with my friend Candice and her sister Sydney. I was also next to my former protege Kenyatta on my left. At the intermission people started to sit in other peoples seats. So these 3 girls sat in Kenyatta and her friends seats and refused to move. The Alphas tried to be nice but she refused to move. We told her that those seats were taken but she sat there anyway. That kind of thing makes me so mad. I know I should not care, no one was crazy enough to sit in my seat, but I just hate ignorant people! If you get there half way though the show, you need to sit in the back at the top, behind that pole. These people are crazy these days, I guess morals are out the window.  The afterparty was cool, I had fun. I stayed till about 1am and I was off to the bed!  All in all, one of the best dang marchdowns period.  God Bless, Raquel  p.s. I will post latter about what people had on. That deserves special attention.
