      i woke up without a hangover from lastnights drinking session, instead my body is in pain from my boxing class. it was a project from last year and only yesterday did i manage to realized it. it was fun and quit addictive. i never new till yesterday how a single round of boxing can exhume so much strenght. i finish four rounds and i tell you it was so exhusting and painfull to the fists. as if all the pain is not enough, i accidentally push the hot water button on the water dispenser that cause some swolleness into my lesf hand. anyway i finish my day yesterday at about 3:am the today..........

      yesterday was the day for my sister, she went to the u.s. embassy for a visa application/interview. i never prayed to god to help her pass the interview, conciously i want her to leave because that will mean cd's and t-shirts. sub-conciously it was different. i am scared and dont want her to go. she doesnt need it. our parents can provide more than enough for both of us, but then again its her life and her decision. she passed and if all goes smoothly she will be living by next month. what will happen to her there is among the many worries me and my parents will endure. we just hope that she succeeds and enjoy life as it comes....

      "why are you an artist?"......... "because i have lots of pain"...... i never saw any episode of six feet under but that may change eventually. i am not an artist but i have lots of pain, lots of disappointments. though unlike before wherein i am under a severe depression, my pain now comes from disappointments and regrets. as much as most of us i also want to go back in time to correct past events that makes me ache in pain now. i am a lonely shadow, always hiding at the back and in search of light so atleast i may be seen and noticed. great regrets often produced fatal outcomes but then again where is the sense in that? i overcome the kindling of suicide and self pitty, i am often smiling now and i can sleep with out any aid of pills, but those are superficial and faux. i may be what others percieved me to be me, but still i am in pain.................

      may 14, my sleep was disturbed by a txt message from budjie, telling me that they are leaving for puerto gallera. i am supposed to be with them the next morning but desided to follow them on the same day. i traveled alone for the next 2 hours. it was a nice drive almost no traffic, but save from the occational boredom add the loss of radio signal, and a helpful hitchhiker, everything is smooth and fine. by 1 pm, my ferry docked onto the shores of white beach. the first five hours was kinda awkward because jaypee was there, but then again we went there for some good time, any grudge must be left at home. by 2 am the next morning i was tired because it has been a long day, by 9:30 am i am leaving the beach to head back home.

      this is my first entry and have nothing to say. im hoping i could do this everyday so i can journal my life as i am going into a great bordedom and uncertainty about my future career and relationships. everyday for me is a routine, quite a cycle of very little assortment, less variation, but i am already used to it. no complaints, just ranting, i guess.

      its been a while since i posted a blog, i was sort of having a writers block, what ever that means. anyway its been raining for some time now, but it is okay. the last three months was scorching and the rain was a welcome relief. though for peewee it means losing income because his into carwash business. i've been going to the gym religiously for three weeks now, im not complaining actually i am enjoying and quite happy with the results. i am more agile and athlethic and give me another month and i will be changing my wardrobe. but not everything is good. the continous rise in fuel will likely go on and it sucks. everyday to and from gym i am spending a good php300.00 for gasoline alone. i change my driving style completely, i hardly floored on the gas pedal but still it consumes gasoline. my body also hurts and i still cannot get the right punch, footwork and position in my boxing class so i always get some flanking from my instructors. i need to improve on my boxing skills.............
