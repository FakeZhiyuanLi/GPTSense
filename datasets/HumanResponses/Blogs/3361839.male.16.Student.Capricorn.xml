      Don't you just hate the utmost totalitarian type of education we get in school?  I do and I am rather pissed about it.  My Math teachers decided that today was officially pricks anonymous day.  He got all upset when he said "We have a lot of work to do today", and I then repeated "We always have lots of work to do".  He immediately became quite intimidating and started demanding I leave the classroom.  Its as if the only reason teachers become that but teachers is so they can have total control over students, its utter bullshit.  Oh well none the less this just goes to show how unforgiving education can be.  Damn and I was hoping the world was still a somewhat reasonably sane place.

      Morals are the enduring figure for the weak.  They are but what the weak use to endure and survive that which they see as wrong.

      I was strolling down the wonderful avenue of my mind today when an idea struck my mind, rather than keeping my thoughts and ideas of he world all wrapped up in a pound of a neurons I should but find a place to put them down.  I thought of paper, but alas paper is a medium which drawings are made not notes of this importance.  I continued upon my wandering thoughts until it came to me, I will but put them on the internet.  Then and there it was born the idea of using a blog, a wondrous idea to whom ever invented it, to store both my thoughts and ideas, and hopefully some good opinions as well.  I do not lavish my mind with the hopes of others reading these writings, I only hope that they are preserved in their entirety for so however long the internet shall live.  Iggy :)

      Theres something, somewhere, somehow... And I have to go right now  The four two syllable words everyone has used, you can be sure that your not the first person in that of making inroads to the use of these fillers.  We start this journey off with eh the two words that mark when you just can not seem to come up with something to say or for that matter saying something that would be just downright rude.  secondly the um word, the thing you use when you just can't think fast enough so your thinker (brain) sticks it in to  give it more er time.  Er, the fixer syllable, commonly used as something shorter than "oh shit I said the wrong word."  And finally the most important one for the many of us who just cannot fathom the idea of listening to someone's entire sentence the first time.  Thats right its hu, it sounds like something from the land of saturday morning cartoons but you would be surprised how many times a day you here it.  An example of its use might be you walking into the office and seeing woman with these amazing boobs then getting all mixed up in them whilst she tries to explain to you something important.  Once she is finished you immediately trip over to hu?   Remember thats: -eh -um -er -hu

      Well I have been staring at a wonderfully color (its black and white) and nicely textured book of Math problems all day and I have managed to complete get this 5 Problems in the last five hours.  Talk about productivity huh? Oh hell with it I think I am going to come up with a short dialogue (Ohhh I love this part)  -*-*- *Kevin Waltz into the Bar* Kevin - Yo Bar keep can I get a shot o whiskey? Bar Keep - CAn't you read? This bar has everything except liquor? Kevin - Really, well then why are there have a dozen drunks sleeping on the counter? Bar Keep - Don't tell them but they think I gave them whiskey but ti was really horse tranquilizer. Kevin - Where'd you get that, I thought only vets could... *Bar keep pulls of apron and points at a sign* Kevin - Oh so your a bar tender and a vet Bar Keep - Makes my day just that much more interesting! Wake up in the morning and treat a few little girls hamsters for severe hiccups and then come by here and watch these guys go through my entire months catalog of various pet drugs and foods. Kevin - Really.... Bar Keep - You shoulda seen them once they got their hands on them dog treats, dang they must have had some special ingredient in them.  Them patrons went nuts. *A Patron wakes up very grogy* Patron - Annnnotheeeeer whiskeeey will yyaaa Tooom  -*-*-*-  Alright thats all I got time for for now I continue it maybe sometime in the future  Iggy :)

      Looking into the almost endless land of Internet Relay Chat (Nerd babble I know), I saw someone continuously typing the most interesting message over and over and over again.  It went like this:  Luorn: @find identity crisis Luorn: @find identity crisis Luorn: @find identity crisis Luorn: @find identity crisis Luorn: @find identity crisis Luorn: @find identity crisis Luorn: WTF WHERE IS MY IDENTITY! Op: You n00b whats the fucks wrong with you?

      My opinions on Iraq...  What's that song that starts off with "Fighting for peace is like fucking for virginity?" Despite all the "peace" (if you can call it that) that we have gained from violent acts it makes us as a civilization no less violent. In fact all it does is solidifies our ability to commit acts of violence. Traditionally violence has also almost always lead to new "innovations" in how we can kill each other better faster and more effectively.   Calling George Bush Jr. a terrorist isn't technically accurate. Point is you can't call a political leader like George Bush a terrorist. It doesn't matter what his actions are because he doesn't fit the profile of a terrorist. He isn't using acts of violence to destabilize America or its political processes. Now a better description of Bush would be a that of one who has committed war crimes. As far as I am concerned invading a country is an illegal act no matter what the circumstances. Then with the prison abuse scandal, which I strongly believe went far higher up the chain of command than just a couple of officers who were bored out of their skulls.   Oh yeah and I hate the Americans damn freedom crap... All it ever leads to is problems. Just look where they are now, trying to defend American values and in the oddest place Iraq, now I'm no scientist but I am pretty sure that Iraq is NOT America. Americans should be defending their values in their own country, not forcing them upon others. Doesn't matter if the leader of that country is a mind crunching evil dogooder. There is a reason you don't bring emotions into decisions like Iraq, but emotions did get caught up in Iraq and look what happens. Oh and by the way that emotion was fear.

      They should test people before they can operate a computer. With  computers becoming such an important part of daily life people should  be restricted in what they can do until they prove that they are  intelligent enough not to become a victim. I am personally sick of  hearing all this bs whining from Computers users regardless what OS  they are running.  You need a license to operate a car legally and you can do serious  damage with that. With peoples naiveness they can do just as much  damage to economies and the world overall with their computers. Just  look at what happens when a new major computer virus comes out, entire  markets have to be closed down and cleaned out because people are to  damn stupid to just be out on the watch and practice safe computing!  Now part of that blame does rest on a media whom is to slow to react to  events like this, as well some of the blame rests on the company who  created the code which failed. But personally I feel the bulk of the  responsibility rests on the user especially if the virus or attack is  that but simply an email attachment.  What bugs me even more is peoples excuses for using Windows and then  giving me hell because they got a virus or they got hacked and all  their files were destroyed.    I know I am going to get heck because people want to be free with what  they can do but really if it means we can cut down on much of the crap  in the computing world isn't it worth it???    I am not saying that we should track people nor am I saying we should  dictate what people can do on the internet! I am simply saying that  people should be required at the bare minimum to know what they are  doing when they are on a computer and how to keep them from their own  blindness.  And for goodness sake stop saying that Linux is so much secure in  contrast to Windows. Unless you lock it down, it can be just as  insecure.  Iggy

      I figured something out today.  When ever I come back from a trip to Mexico or somewhere around there I miss a number of things, but by far the one thing I miss the most is how the air has a seemingly drenched taste.  A taste that one can only experience to understand it.  The taste of the water mixing with any number of things.  I would like to think that it might also have a hint of tequila in there ;)  Iggy :)
