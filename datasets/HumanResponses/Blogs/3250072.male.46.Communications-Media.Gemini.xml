      Bill Cosby is a funny man, but he also has a very serious side as well.  The comedian, who has a doctorate (in education, I believe) from Temple University, has for a number of years been active in supporting historically black colleges (if you remember during the "Cosby Show" years he would often appear in scenes wearing sweats of various colleges) and helping improving the ability for young African-American young people to earn a higher education.  Not long ago during an NAACP event commerorating the 50th anniversary of the  Brown -vs- Board of Education  decision, Cosby strongly criticized many facets of African-American culture...from speaking habits to spending to urban fashion.  And he was  right on target !  The only thing is, The Coz could have been speaking about the overall culture today of many young people, regardless of race or skin colour.  I include some of his comments here, courtesy of the  urlLink  Washington Post     "Ladies and gentlemen, the lower economic people are not holding up their end in this deal," he declared. "These people are not parenting. They are buying things for kids -- $500 sneakers for what? And won't spend $200 for 'Hooked on Phonics.' . . .   "They're standing on the corner and they can't speak English," he exclaimed. "I can't even talk the way these people talk: 'Why you ain't,' 'Where you is' . . . And I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk. And then I heard the father talk. . . . Everybody knows it's important to speak English except these knuckleheads. . . . You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth!"   The Post's Hamil Harris reports that Cosby also turned his wrath to "the incarcerated," saying: "These are not political criminals. These are people going around stealing Coca-Cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake and then we run out and we are outraged, [saying] 'The cops shouldn't have shot him.' What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand?"    Please note here that he did not specifically refer to African-Americans here.  I know quite a few white folks that would fit these comments to a tee.  Those people who are choosing to criticize Dr. Cosby's comments are simply short-sighted and need to take a moment for a reality check.

      This has NOT been a good weekend so far.  It turns out I forgot to write down a payment I had made in my check register, which has really screwed up my bank balance royally to the point that when my son and I ordered pizza last week, it overdrew my account.  Thank God for overdraft protection!  But the downside, of course, is that you still have to pay the penalty; in my case, my bank (Bank of America) charged a $17.00 fee.  No complaint here, as it was my screwup.  BOA has been really good to me, and this is the first time this has happened.  The only problem is that I had to actually  borrow money from my daughter  in order to have enough to pay my rent!  I'm having to keep a much closer watch over finances now, since the rent went up $50 a month when we renewed the lease here this past month...but it was better than expected, considering the improvements made in the community over the past year.  On the upside, I stayed home with family Friday evening instead of going to a political event.  Kinda unusual, but I am the public relations committee chairman for the local  urlLink Democratic Party , so it's usually good that I be at those events.  It was a quickly planned meet-and-greet for a County Commission candidate who had very recently entered the race for one of the four seats to be decided on the ballot, but I was simply tired after a long week of work and ready to enjoy a quiet three day weekend with my son and granddaughter.  In that respect, the weekend has been good!

      The mind is wandering while the rest of the family is sleeping this early Saturday morning, so let me share what's on my mind while I've been reading the morning news...  Sad to hear the Citrus Connection, the Lakeland/Winter Haven area's mass transit service, is planning to discontinue it's Night Ride program as of July 1.  Night Ride offered workers from 9 PM until midnight who didn't have other transportation options a way of getting to and from their jobs.  Unfortunately, a lack of riders and loss of grant funding means no more service.  There were a couple of problems.  First, the  urlLink Citrus Connection  hardly promoted the service at all.  According the  urlLink the  Lakeland Ledger  story this morning , transit director Steve Githens admitted it was marketed on a shoestring budget.  Not quite the way you want people to know about your service, Steve!  Then a representative of the Downtown Development Authority was quoted as saying ridership would increase if people would people would catch a bus after hours to dinner and movie without worrying about the after dinner drink.  One problem with that:  the Night Ride service was marketed only for  nighttime workers .    In order to ride you had to 1) Go to the Citrus Connection office and fill out an application stating your place of employment, 2) have their staff verify your employment, and 3) wait for you to be mailed a card which you have to present to the driver when boarding the Night Ride bus.  It only provided door-to-door service to and/or from your workplace.  That was the purpose of Night Ride, as it was funded by welfare reform grants...which are now going, going, gone.  Thanks, Jeb!  Thanks, Dubya!  And speaking of Jeb, it looks as though he will veto part of the budget that provides funding for restoration of publicly owned historical sites at  urlLink Cypress Gardens .  Sounds like the state is beginning to balk on it's commitment to preserve the Gardens, Florida's first theme park which was closed last year after over 70 years but scheduled to reopen later this year under new owner Kent Buescher.  It'll be truly interesting to see the place when it does reopen.  Buescher owns  urlLink Wild Adventures Theme Park  near Valdosta, Georgia, and plans to make Cypress Gardens more family-friendly instead of an attraction for senior citizens and wedding parties while keeping intact the original botanical gardens created by Dick and Julie Pope so many years ago.

      Some random thoughts as I begin a three day weekend...  I want to see   urlLink The Day After Tomorrow  for myself, just for the entertainment value.  I read the a couple of reviews of the new Fox movie today, and both  urlLink Roger Ebert  and  urlLink USA Today critic Mike Clark  panned it severely except for it's special effects.  And the film has sparked a political debate over the question of global warming and the government's enviromental policy.  Everybody...step back and...take a deep breath.   IT'S ONLY A MOVIE!   It is not meant to be a diatribe on major issues of the day, only a two-plus hour bit of entertainment.  Certainly, we have serious concerns about the enviroment.  This administration has failed miserably in the area of protecting our resources.  But let's keep those discussions where they belong...in the political and policy arenas.   The Day After Tomorrow  should be looked at simply for what it is...a fictional dramatic work of entertainment value only in the eyes of the viewer.  And it has not been a grand year for the  urlLink Polk County School District .  It has seen several school administrators either fired or investigated for putting their hands where they didn't belong...either in the school or organizational tills or under student's clothes.  Just this week,  urlLink the dean of discipline at the school district's alternative school for students with discipline problems was arrested and charged with having a sexual relationship with a girl that began when she was 11 .  And an  urlLink investigation against a high school band director has been closed by the Sheriff's Office  as the alleged victim has dropped the case, according to the   urlLink Lakeland Ledger  .  The school district and the state department of education's Office of Professional Practices Services will continue it's own investigations.    It also seems that now Superintendent Jim Thornhill's term is about to end, he is busy letting principals know their contracts are not being renewed.  And on top of it all, the five schools in Lake Wales have formed their own  charter school district , the first attempt to do so in Florida since the idea of charter schools was established.  The very idea circumvents the law mandating one school district for each county statewide, thus spreading the tax base as equally as possible countywide and making equal school resources available throughout a county instead of centered in one city or area.  With a new superintendent set to take over soon, she's got a lot of work ahead.

      TGIF!  After I finish this day, it's a three day weekend to enjoy the pool, the computer, and my beautiful three year old granddaughter.  But let's not forget...it's Memorial Day weekend.  A lot of us have simply forgotten the purpose for Memorial Day.  It is a day to remember those people who have sacrificed life and limb in the service of our nation at home and away wearing the uniforms of our military.  To them we owe much, not the least of which is our most sincere thanks.  That's why, even when I'm collecting past due funds from a customer on my job and they happen to mention a loved one serving in the military, I always ask the customer to pass along my thanks to them for their relative's service to our country.  Might cost me points on the quality assurance grade, but it's sincere.  Unfortunately, in today's political scene, there are some who happen to feel that if you don't walk in lockstep with President Bush and his reasoning for going into Iraq along with his plan for our troops there, you are somehow not patroitic and not supporting our military there.  That is like the neocoms in the White House that tend to wrap themselves in the flag and believe that somehow they are the only real patriots.  That's simply not the truth.  While we may disagree on the reasoning and method of how to proceed in Iraq, we all support our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines whereever they are, and pray for their safe return soon.  Please take some time during your happy weekend of family and fun to remember the people who helped provide the safety we all enjoy.

      Another season of "American Idol" is behind us.  And after all the bad, off pitch performances, controveresies about voting, and various other conspiracy ideas being floated about, the right contestant won.  North Carolina's Fantasia Barrino came through the old fashioned way:  She was simply the best singing talent the show has seen in it's three seasons... bar none! .  Even the usually ascerbic judge, producer Simon Cowell, admitted as much after one of her three songs during Monday night's final matchup against Georgia teen Donna DeGarmo.  This is simply one talent to keep a close eye on over the next several years.  If she has good guidance and avoids the pitfalls that so many fall into throughout the music business, this talented young woman could become a superstar.  But don't cry for young Miss DeGarmo.  While her vocal talents are nowhere near Fantasia's --- or, for that matter, several of the other finalists who were voted off before her --- it was truly her stage presence that kept her in the competition.  Her youthful enthusiam and ability to relate to the audience apparantly counted more than her vocal talents.  With time and some vocal coaching, she can and will do quite well as a performer.  So where does the show go from here.  After three years, it certainly needs to evolve so that it does not become dull.  One idea would be to change the panel of judges.  Unfortunately, Randy, Paula, and Simon simply are beginning to look bored in their roles.  And while theme nights are a good idea, keep within the format!

      A couple of random musings before steppin' out to collect money from all these people behind on their telephone bills this Thursday morning...  How soon we forget.  Of course, the high gasoline prices we are experiencing now is nothing short of criminal, and noone wants to pay two dollars a gallon.  But now that the Saudis have said that they would increase production and are attempting to bring their OPEC brethern into the fold, I remember it was not long ago that we were reading reports of a sweetheart deal between President Bush and the Saudi royal family that they would manipulate production to bring prices down in time for the November elections.  The Saudi Arabian move seems more than just a coincidence now...  Former Florida House Speaker  urlLink Johnnie Byrd  is an also ran.  He began a TV ad campaign this week touting his conservative credentials as he seeks the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Democratic incumbant Bob Graham.  Sorry, but the way he ran the state house the past two years alienated even his fellow Republicans, and as soon as this year's session ended several of his former collegues who had endorsed his campaign jumped off the ship like rats off the  Titanic .  He'll be lucky to be in the second tier of Republicans behind McCollum and Martinez.  And  urlLink Betty Castor , will you   PLEASE QUIT TAKING THE TAMPA BAY AREA FOR GRANTED  !?!?  One of her supporters had scheduled a fundraising event in Auburndale for June, rented the building, and was making plans for the event when her campaign people called and cancelled saying there was a "scheduling conflict" in South Florida...nice way of saying a good way of getting a LOT MORE $$$ than in Polk County.  If that's the case, JUST SAY IT!  Don't get me wrong, I like Betty Castor.  I believe she'll be the Democratic nominee after her two primary opponents, who dislike each other with a passion, beat each other up while Ms. Castor stands aside and watches, waiting to pick up the pieces.  And I believe she can defeat either Martinez or McCollum in the general election.  But she can't afford to leave her home base vunerable.

      Remember four years ago when there were over 20,000 Florida citizens who were improperly removed from the state's voter rolls?  Now, six months before the 2004 election, half of Florida's 67 counties have responded to a request by state election officials to check if any of the voters removed in 2000 should be reinstated as required under a legal settlement between the state, the NAACP, and other groups reached nearly two years ago.  According to a story in the  urlLink Miami Herald , along the I-4 Corridor only Brevard, Hillsborough, Osceola, Sarasota, and Volusia counties have responded.  Of those only Hillsborough and Osceola have actually reported actually reported adding names back to the rolls...Hillsborough with 579, and Osceola with nine.  Sounds like a LOT OF WORK needs to be done, especially since Jeb! has ordered a new purge of the voter rolls statewide prior to the presidential election.  And this latest list of approximately 47,000 voters has errors...at least Leon County Assistant Supervisor of Elections Janet Olin is saying her office has already found some in the new list.

      Myrian Marquez is truly an insightful columnist.  Ever since she began writing her column for the  urlLink Orlando Sentinel  a few months ago, I have looked forward to her occasional musings.    Her column Sunday was especially insightful.  It dealt with the latest controversy in the Roman Catholic Church in America, as several bishops have threatened or actually instructed their priests to withhold Communion from political candidates or officials whose positions are contrary to the Church's teachings.  Most notably, this affects the soon-to-be Democratic presidential nominee, John Kerry, who is of the Catholic faith and could be the first Catholic president since John F. Kennedy.  Check out  urlLink this wonderful piece of work from Ms. Marquez , who also is editor of the Sentinel's Spanish edition.  Seems as though one of our local residents had the same ideas the previous week, and sent it as a letter to the editor at the  urlLink Lakeland Ledger .   EDITOR'S NOTE:  The  Ledger  finally printed her letter today (Friday, 28 May)!  She gave me permission to reprint it prior to it being printed:    Thomas Wenski's column epitomizes everything that is wrong with the Catholic church. First of all, there is no such thing as "pro-abortion". The correct term is pro-choice, because that is exactly what it is: a choice. No one is dragging women by the hair into clinics to force them to terminate a pregnancy, but we've certainly seen pro-"lifers" trying to prevent women from making their own decisions. Seems the word life in that term only applies to the fetus, and not to the woman carrying it.  Secondly, the Catholic church has a lot of work to do on itself before it purports to know what is good for anyone. This whole communion issue is a partisan witch hunt designed to make Democrats look bad. During the last governor's election in Michigan, pro-"life" Catholics actually picketed outside of churches on Sundays to bring attention to the fact that Jennifer Granholm is a Catholic and pro-choice. Luckily, their strong arm tactics did not work--she won handily. Let's not forget, the people in charge of this witch hunt belong to the same organization that turned a blind eye to the sexual abuse of children that went on for many years. Not only a blind eye, but they created a safety net for abusive priests, many of whom never were or never will be punished.   Thirdly, I know a great number of Catholics that are sterilized, using birth control, had children out of wedlock, etc, that attend church every Sunday and take communion. Are they going to start handing out a questionnaire about your personal life before they distribute the Eucharist? They may be surprised to find that no one, no matter what political coat they wear, is really "able" to partake in this ritual.  Lastly, let us not forget that one of the Ten Commandments plainly states: Thou Shalt Not Kill. Wenski fails to mention that the church should be denying communion to Jeb Bush as well if they are going to play this game fairly. The hypocrisy of the Catholic church is staggering.  If the point of religion and the act of going to church is designed to bring one closer to holiness, as Wenski says, why deny someone's closeness to god simply because they aren't perfect? I wasn't aware that perfection was a prerequisite to enter a church. I thought the church accepted anyone, anytime, for any reason. Apparently, there is no sanctuary for one who does not live up to the church's standards, or follow every one of their rules, all of the time.    You just can't have your wafer and eat it, too!

      Greetings from Imperial Polk County, Florida...in the center of it all!  Welcome to my new blog, Interstate4Jamming.  It is intended to be an occasional commentary on a variety of subjects, primarily local and regional politics, but also every once in a while I may go off on whatever other issue happens to touch me.  Please feel free to respond at any time; that's what the reponse links are for.  I am a 45 year old collection agent from Lakeland, a lifelong Democrat who is active in the local  urlLink party executive committee .  I consider myself more of a centrist, and believe with all my heart that it's time for a clean sweep from the court house in Bartow (actually the County Administration Building) to the State House to the White House.  We actually need some progressive thinking people in office who understand ordinary working people.  Unfortunately, many of those in office today simply don't care a rat's behind about the vast majority of us,   I am fairly new to blogging, and I am still learning.  My thanks to those who own the Tampa area blogs  urlLink Sticks of Fire  and  urlLink Florida Politics  for ideas, although they don't know it (at least until now).

      A couple of things on my mind this Monday afternoon...  I see from  urlLink Florida Politics   that the Florida AFL-CIO decided to endorse both Betty Castor and Peter Deutsch in the Democratic race for U.S. Senate, leaving Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas the odd man out.  Betty's the better candidate of the three, and was able to get the co-endorsement thanks to the Florida Education Association, which has a lot of clout in the state AFL-CIO.  Castor is a former state education secretary, not to mention former president of the University of South Florida.  She's been handling herself with class, rather quiet compared to Deutsch and Penelas, who dislike each other greatly and don't mind sharing that fact with the public.  As for Penelas, many in the labor movement don't think much of him anyway because of how some were treated in Miami during the big summit last year by some of the area's law enforcement.  When he appeared at the Polk County Democratic Executive Committee meeting in May while in the area for a debate before the local Tiger Bay Club, some of the local labor activists who are on the DEC were ready and waiting with some very pointed questions.  To get the meeting moving, committee chairman L. Mark Kaylor had to eventually ask them to take their questions with Penelas outside, and asked the State Committeeman to meet with them to insure everything remained civil.  Watch Betty move on up...  And the local broadcast media continues to evolve.  Of course, I worked in radio for 15 years here and in my native Mississippi, so I keep up with what's happening.  It continues to amaze me how the locals are able to survive or attempt to do so located between not one but two major markets, Tampa/St. Petersburg and Orlando/Daytona Beach.  With huge corporate titans such as Clear Channel, Cox, and Infinity dominating both markets, smaller companies really have a hard time of it in markets such as Lakeland/Winter Haven.  One station has gone from urban to Spanish and back to R&B/Urban in six months.  And a former religious station is now leased by a right wing activist who is formerly the PR voice for the Polk County Sheriff's Office.  She uses it to promote Bush/Cheney, The Christian Law Association, Dr. James Kennedy's group in South Florida, and various right wing entities during her two hour diatribe weekday afternoons, not to mention airing Michael Reagan and almost any other far right talker on the air except Rush (who is already taken in this market).  We need more moderate and progressive voices on the air, and I'm not necessairly talking about far left, but responsible individuals who can discuss issues without screaming and going into endless mind games like some of these folks on both extremes do.

      There seems to be a lack of class among our political leaders, and that's sad.  On the floor of the United States Senate last week, there was a confrontation between Senator Lehay, a Democrat, and Vice President Dick Chaney during a photo opportunity (Chaney is the president of the Senate as part of his veep duties), during which Chaney dropped the "F" bomb at his adversary in a violation of the honoured rules of decorum of the Senate floor.  There's nothing wrong with having disagreements over issues and policies; that's just part of democractic multiparty government.  But you do not allow such disagreements to become personal as apparantly Cheney did this past week.  Unfortunately, there are rogues in both the Republican and Democratic parties who believe in the rule of win at all costs, of "my way or no way".  In our form of government, one has to learn that often that attitude does not work and that must of the time you must comprimise to get your issue resolved in incriments over time.  After all, half of something is much better than all of nothing.  But since the days of Newt Gingrich becoming Speaker of the House during the "Reagan Revolution", the Republican leadership has taken the attitude that comprimise with the other side is not an option.  It seems that this cancer has now spread to the other side of the Capitol.  It's time to cut out that cancer, and to do that we need a Democratic House and Senate majority NOW, not to mention John Kerry as the next President of the United States.  While I'm writing this morning, I noticed that Ralph Nader didn't get the Green Party nomination yesterday.  Smart move by the Greens, who apparantly say Nader's campaign really is, a vanity run and that a vote for him is really a vote for GWB.

      Getting on the pulpit on this Saturday afternoon while waiting on my new power source...  Was interesting to read about  urlLink Illinois Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jack Ryan  dropping out after parts of his divorce papers were unsealed earlier this week that were, to say the least, quite embarrassing to him.  Seems he was married to the actress Jeri Ryan, best known for her roles as the alien crew member Seven of Nine in the sci-fi series "Star Trek:  Voyager" (remember the rather tight outfits the producers would have her wear?) and later as a teacher in the FOX series "Boston Public".  According to the court papers, he took her to sex clubs in New Orleans, New York and Paris and attempted to pressure her to perform sexual acts in those clubs in from of others.  She claims that she resisted such attempts, and that although he promised not to take her to such places again he did so and was angered when she said "No".  I don't blame her.  HE'S JUST A FREAK WHO JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT "NO" MEANS!  He should have known if he had political aspirations that this stuff would have come out sooner or later.  Although it may have been sealed on good grounds origainlly --- to protect their son, now nine years of age --- it's simply not good grounds to maintain the openness of the court system, and the court was proper in unsealing the records.  Tough luck, sucker!   urlLink Lakeland Electric  is not the most customer friendly utility in the area when it comes to an area one would think it would want to be...paying one's bills.  Most utilities allow you to pay your current charges online using your credit or debit card without requiring you to switch to an automatic monthly setup.  Most customers don't want to go that route because 1) we want to insure the funds are in our account, and 2) we may not be able to pay the full amount and need to make arrangements accordingly.  Not Lakeland Electric.  The only option they allow online is for automatic monthly payments.  Otherwise you've gotta mail it in or head to their offices on U.S. 98 before 5:00 PM or downtown before 6:00 PM.  This from a company with a notorious reputation of waste and for the first time in it's history will post a loss.  Maybe it's time for a little better customer service.  And on a good note, kudos to the folks at  urlLink Gateway Customer Service .  I posted earlier in the week that my power supply fried on my Gateway computer, forcing me to rely on my backup IBM Aptiva and it's Windows 95 for a few days until Gateway sends me a replacement power supply via UPS.  The IBM is three years old and is a bit slower, but at least it allows me to stay online in the meantime.  That said, the Gateway CS reps have been very kind, professional, and patient throughout my calls while we went through everything to ascentain the issues and finally determined the problem.  If everything runs according to plan, the power supply should arrive Monday or Tuesday and I should be back on the Gateway computer within a day or two of that.  It too bad that the Gateway stores closed.  I purchased my 'puter at the store here in Lakeland; it closed last year as most of the Gateway stores were starting to shut down.  It's a top notch machine, and the support has been very good as well.

      You know, if it ain't one thing, it's another.  I had just rebooted everything on my computer over the weekend thanks to a virus that got through my screening.  Now my power supply on my main tower is down!  Had to replace it with my old computer --- Windows 95 and all --- to use temporairly until Gateway sends a replacement power supply.  Life really is crazy!

      Well, I'm back after a crazy weekend.  Seems as though my computer was hit with a virus which wiped out everything I had that was not saved on backup discs.  I thought I was being good and doing what was supposed to be done to prevent that from happening, since I had been hit once before, but it seemingly wasn't good enough.  Got myself some added protection this time, and added a couple of pop up blocks, as I believe one of those had to do with what occured.  Be more vigiliant about checking the system...that's what I've learned, even if it took twice.

      It's hurricane season again here in the Gulf South.  Some people are always wondering about not if, but when, the next Catagory 4 or 5 storm will sweep across Florida or line a bead on Tampa Bay.  I remember my first Catagory 5 hurricane, Camille, in 1969.  I was only 11 years old at the time, living with my family in south Jones County, Mississippi...about 100 miles inland from it's landfall on the Harrison County coast.  It was just as scary inland.  And I also remember about six, seven months later my grandmother took me and one of my cousins to the Gulfport-Biloxi area to drive along the beachfront U.S. 90.  I'll never forget the HUGE cargo ship that had been swept over the beach, four lanes of traffic, and was at the time sitting in the front yard of one of the Antebellum homes along the highway near Beuvoiur, the last home of Confederate President Jefferson Davis.  And I'll never forget being on-air at a radio station in Mississippi during a hurricane...it almost blew the roof off our building.  While I was reading the latest storm statements/closures, my collegue burst in the studio yelling that the roof had come off in the business office.  Always respect the might of Nature.

      Back to the grind again...  After a week's vacation highlighted by being laid up much of the time with a severe case of gout, it was time to get back to work yesterday.  Unfortunately, I didn't get as much done as planned over the week, but it was really nice not to get up quite as early.  I'm still busy working to update the  urlLink Polk County Democratic Party Web site .  Check it out when you have the chance; it's a lot better than it was, with more information...and it's UPDATED REGULARLY!    Make it a great day...

      Laid up with a severe case of gout this vacation week...  I watched much of the Reagan funeral coverage on TV Friday.  As I mentioned in an earlier post, I didn't care much for Reagan's policies and programs while in office, but he had a gift of communication and imagry that you simply had to respect.  What really got me was as the casket was being loaded at Andrews AFB for the flight to his beloved California, the Air Force Band played the Largo from Dvorak's "New World Symphony", which was eventually matched with lyrics from on old Negro spiritual called "Going Home".  When I heard that musical piece, I simply lost it all.  Then when I read the lyrics earlier today, it hit all over again.  The site of someone making his last journey to the home he so loved was simply too much, as it brought some of my own longings for my native Mississippi and times long past return to the surface.  These lyrics are simply remarkable, and best known in performance by the great African-American vocalist Paul Roebson:   Goin' Home    Goin' home, goin' home, I'm a goin' home; Quiet-like, some still day, I'm jes' goin' home. It's not far, jes' close by, Through an open door; Work all done, care laid by, Gwine (or: Goin') to fear no more.  Mother's there 'spectin' me, Father's waitin' too; Lots o' folk gather'd there, All the friends I knew, All the friends I knew. Home, I'm goin' home!  Nothin lost, all's gain, No more fret nor pain, No more stumblin' on the way, No more longin' for the day, Gwine (or Going) to roam no more! Mornin' star lights the way, Res'less dream all done; Shadows gone, break o' day, Real life jes' begun. Dere's no break, ain't no end, (or: There's no break, there's no end,) Jes' a livin' on; Wide awake, with a smile Goin' on and on.  Goin' home, goin' home, I'm jes' goin' home, It's not far, jes' close by Through an open door. I'm a goin' home, I'm jes' goin' Goin' home, goin' home, goin' home, goin' home, goin' home, goin' home!

      WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ARE THE CHAMMMMMMMMMPIONS, MY FRIENDDDDDDDDD...AND WE'LLLLLLLLLLL KEEP ON FIGHTING 'TILL THE ENDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD...  Congratulations to the Tampa Bay Lightning on their hard fought victory in bringing the Stanley Cup home last night.  The Lightning and Calgary Flames players simply played their hearts out knowing what was at stake, but in the end the better team came away the winner.  Also huge kudos to Mr. Richards, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs.  It was well deserved, to say the least.  I'm sure he would agree, though, that it's too bad he couldn't cut it up and give it to each of his teammates for their efforts.  And you've got to give our fans a HUGE amount of respect for how they conducted themselves after the game.  It was pure celebration, not the sporadic violence and lawlessness often seen in cities after their sports team wins a championship.  It goes to show you that a community CAN party without setting fires, breaking windows, and turning over vehicles.  Just as when our Bucs won the Super Bowl, the Tampa Bay fans showed class...and you couldn't ask for anything better!

      Yesterday was a day of almosts, great sadness, and great happiness.  I found myself rooting for Smarty Jones in the Belmont Stakes, but my son was right...he wasn't able to hold up through the longer distance and lost in the last few seconds.  So the Triple Crown waits for another suitor next year...maybe.  Then the  urlLink Tampa Bay Lightning  had everyone on pins and needles for much of the night until Martin St. Louis scored a goal early in the second OT period to force the Stanley Cup Final Game Seven in Tampa!  It's now one game,    WINNER TAKE ALL!!!     What a night that will be tomorrow!  Then there was the death yesterday of former President Ronald Reagan.  While I and many fellow Democrats disagreed with many of his policies and programs, we salute his years of service to our nation and are deeply saddened as the rest of America this morning at his passing.  Alzheimer's disease is something I would not wish on anyone, and I simply pray that if I became stricken as Reagan that God would take me early so that my family would not have to deal with the long period of suffering that his beloved wife Nancy must have dealt with.  And give her a great deal of credit for always being there, never publicly complaining or lamenting about his condition, simply taking things as they came.  She has handled herself with a dignity and class through such a lengthy ordeal.  Finally, I watched  Urban Cowboy  yesterday on one of the cable channels.  It always brings back memories when I see the John Travolta movie, as much of it was filmed in and around Pasadena, Texas, one of the blue-collar suburbs southeast of Houston.  I lived there while in high school during the early/mid 1970s, and passed by Gilley's nightclub many times (it burned down under suspicious circumstances several years after the film was made after country singer Mickey Gilley and his manager, who owned "The World's Biggest Honky-Tonk" parted ways under less-than-good terms).  I found love in Pasadena then too, and still think about that girl to this day.  Well, she's married to a computer games designer and has a family in Austin, Texas...those were the days.

      Happy Saturday from Imperial Polk County!  A few random blubs as I start a week's well deserved vacation time...  It's hard to believe that we still have this type of discrimination in 2004, but the state is suing a motel in Perry after complaints that the owner put African-American customers in inferior rooms and told black customers they could not use the pool, and immediately put chemicals into it after black guests used it.  The owner is not your cookie cutter white redneck racist...he's originally from India.  I was born and raised in Mississippi during the Civil Rights era.  To this date, at the front of the Jones County Courthouse in Ellisville, there are two concrete water fountains that have not been used in decades...one in large letters says "WHITE"; the other, in smaller letters, says "COLORED".  They remain there for the historical significance, and probably as a reminder that we should learn from the errors of the past.  Getting off the soapbox, I see from  urlLink Sticks of Fire  that  urlLink Cheap Trick  played in Tampa Thursday night.  Great band, but unfortunately it hasn't been the same since Rick Nielsen left.  Now the bands I REALLY want to see are  urlLink Chicago  and  urlLink Earth, Wind, & Fire , scheduled to play the new Ford Ampitheatre at the Florida State Fairgrounds in Tampa July 27.  That should be one heckuva show!

      Sorry it's been a couple of days since my last post.  Hope your Memorial Day weekend was a pleasant one, and that you took time to remember those who have served and continue to do so wearing the uniform of our military forces here and around the world.  While we may not always agree with our political leaders over policy and methods regarding how our military might is used, we should always support those who risk life and limb in the service of our nation.  On a lighter note, how 'bout those  urlLink Tampa Bay Lightning ?!?!  They simply don't give up in their quest to give Lord Stanley's Cup a tan here in Central Florida!  Knowing it would be a rough task for game four in Calgary after their loss in the previous contest against a tough (and at times borderline dirty hitting) Flames team as well as their rabid fans, the Lightning --- and especially G Nikolai Khabibulin --- stepped up and came away with a 1-0 win.  So now it's a best of three series as the teams meet again in Tampa tomorrow night...   GO BOLTS!     The main reason for my absence has been that I've been working on updating the Website for the  urlLink Polk County Democratic Party .  After several months of inactivity, a couple of us were able to get the necessary software downloaded and are in the process of reconstructing it.  Give it a look, but please don't judge it for how it looks now.  There's still A LOT OF WORK left to do, but we've been concentrating on updating information on meeting schedules and important news.  We will be adding information on our candidates and much more as we move on.  BTW:  We're using  urlLink Macromedia's  Dreamweaver and Contribute2 software, and it has worked fine for us so far.

      It was odd walking into The Gym, a sports bar in downtown Lakeland, last night.  Instead of the big screens in the corner showing one of the several baseball games that were available, they were on C-SPAN and the Democratic National Convention for John Kerry's acceptance speech.  The Gym was the site for one of the "Kerry House Parties" held across the country to watch the event, one of three in Polk County alone!  It was a good crowd, with over 40 people cheering along with the delegates and guests in Boston...and the REALLY GREAT THING is that the group was not just the same old Democratic activists you see at the same old events every month!  Many of the people were young newbies, excited about the prospects, and the site gave me REAL HOPE for our prospects this fall!  I spoke with the person who hosted a similar event at the All Star Grill in Winter Haven, and she said there was a similar scene among the 30+ in attendance.  Many of those were also people who have not been to previous political events, and another like scene was reported by  urlLink congressional candidate Jeff Siemer  when he was as yet another Kerry event.  And while I'm talking politics today, let me note that I'm burning up about  urlLink Mississippi Senator Trent Lott's comment the other day at the Neshoba County Fair near Philadelphia, MS .  It's one thing to call John Kerry a liberal --- even accurate, when you really consider the true defination of the word --- but to call him a "French-speaking socialist..." is truly close to slander.  I thought Lott had learned from the last time he stuck his foot in his mouth...and lost his Senate leadership position as a result.

      First, it's great to be back online...albeit using my backup computer.&nbsp; IT was giving me problems until a couple of days ago.&nbsp; Needless to say, I'll be a happy man when Gateway is done working on my main machine!   A few notes about the Democratic National Convention, which started today in Boston:   1)&nbsp; Former president Bill Clinton proved again why he is such a great communicator.&nbsp; He certainly knows how to work an audience.&nbsp; His 25 minute speech was really wonderful.&nbsp; Clinton hit on all the right points, not afraid to even point out his own efforts to skip service in Vietnam to show John Kerry's willingness to serve.&nbsp; Hillary could learn from her husband...she was good, but by no means at his level.&nbsp;   2)&nbsp; Was good to hear from Al Gore as well.&nbsp; The former VP seemed really passioniate in his remarks to the convention.&nbsp; Would really like to see him return to public service at some point.  3)&nbsp; Noted that Ben Affleck spoke to the Florida delegation at their breakfast meeting Monday.&nbsp; Wonder if anyone bothered asking him any questions about J-Lo?  4)&nbsp; If Kerry is truly smart --- and I believe he is --- there will be a place in his administration for former four star general and NATO Supreme Commander Wesley Clark.&nbsp; Saw General Clark on "Hardball" Monday, and he handled host Chris Matthews very well...and that's saying a lot.&nbsp; At times Matthews can be really boorish, always insisting on getting the final word.&nbsp; But Clark didn't give an inch, making sure his points were brought to the front even as Matthews tried to steer the conversation elsewhere.&nbsp; With his three decades-plus of military experience, including his additional responsibilities as a diplomat in dealing with our allies worldwide, it would be a serious mistake not to consider him for a key position...Secretary of Defense, for instance?  5)&nbsp; Looking forward to hearing from Howard Dean, who is among Tuesday's featured speakers.

      You'd better watch what you say, even to your backers.  It just may backfire on you!  It seems as though  urlLink 12th District Republican incumbant Congressman Adam Putnam  sent a fundraising letter to his moneyed friends recently.  It said that   the ghost of Howard Dean was coming after him !   Actually, the letter referred to his main Democratic rival,  urlLink Lakeland software salesman Jeffrey Siemer ...who had been active supporting Dean's presidential bid and has said that the former Vermont governor's campaign was a catalyst for his own decision to seek the congressional seat.  Putnam was asking supporters to pony up even more money for the campaign,   even though he has approximately 95 times Siemer's backroll!    The story was picked up by the  urlLink St. Petersburg Times , which ran it in it's "Political Junkie" column last Thursday.  From there it was one of the featured items  urlLink on the blog  for  urlLink Dean's organization, Democracy For America , over the weekend.  Since then, his campaign manager has noted that Siemer has received several hundred dollars in donations from across the country, and even from an expatriot living in Japan!  Before now, Siemer had been just another local congressional candidate facing uphill odds against a heavily favoured incumbant.  Hey, maybe Putnam --- known as "Red" by President Bush --- should send out more of these letters!

      Nice to have a computer that works normally now...so a couple of ideas running through my idle mind on a Saturday afternoon...  ---I watched the  urlLink Kerry/Edwards   rally in St. Pete on  urlLink Bay News 9  the other evening.  Glad I did, as over 10,000 showed up but only around 2,000 actually got into the Coliseum before the Fire Marshall said no more.  A couple of local fellow Democratic activists made the trip and were among the crowd outside for hours, having to hear the speeches on speakers before the Two Johns Team came outside to acknowledge the huge gathering.  Edwards is such a magnificant speaker, and it's to Kerry's credit that he wasn't afraid to pick a running mate who will likely often outshine him as a public speaker.  You can also tell it rubs off on the soon-to-be Democratic presidential nominee.  Can't wait to see Edwards and Cheney debate this fall!  ---Read this morning where the hosts of the  urlLink "Monsters of the Morning"  radio show, which is based in Orlando but also airs in Jacksonville and Tampa/St. Petersburg, are having to go through "sensitivity training" next week per mandate by employer  urlLink Clear Channel Communications  after complaints regarding the some of the racial slurs used on their show.  The "Monsters", a comedy team which has built a midday following in Orlando before CCC switched them to morning drive and expanded their audience statewide after "Bubba The Love Sponge" Clem was sacked for indecency complaints resulting in fines from the FCC, changed their tone from sexual based humor (or attempts at it) to racial based, as the FCC seems to be only concerned about offensive references to bodily or sexual functions.  Clear Channel only acted after receiving complaings from the St. Petersburg City Commission and Pinellas County NAACP Chapter.  It really wasn't that long ago that radio hosts could do good humor without relying to tasteless crap such as these folks along with Howard Stern and their ilk put out.

      Polk County is an interesting place...we all want better roads, better schools, controlled growth...we just don't want to pay more for it, or at least want someone else to foot the bill.  Not really much different from anywhere else, truth be known.  The Polk County Commission paid University of South Florida political science professor Susan McManus $44,000 to conduct a survey of 800 residents from throughout the county to determine what issues and services were most important.  When asked about quality of life, 44 percent said it was the same as five years ago, 30 percent said better, and 12 percent said it was worse.  And the most important issues:  Top of the list was growth/new development, followed by public schools/education and traffic/public education (most of these folks must have been driving on I-4 in Polk recently, especially around U.S. 98 in Lakeland!)  Here's an interesting note:  When asked what the county spends too much on, 61 percent said  they didn't know .  Forty-two percent gave the same answer when asked what the county  spends too little on .  This information appeared in an article which appeared in  urlLink Monday's Lakeland Ledger .

      Have you been watching  urlLink Jeopardy  lately?  If you haven't, now may be a good time to check it out.  Not only is it the show's 20th anniversary (are they counting the original daytime version with Art Fleming on NBC as well?), but contestant Ken Jennings, a software engineer from Utah, is really raking in the dough!  The show changed it's rules this season, doing away with the five-game limit for contestants and allowing them to continue playing until they are defeated.  Jennings (as of the shows scheduled to air Friday) has now won 23 consecutive days and racked up $755,360 in winnings.  This guy simply has the time down for pressing the button.  On Friday's show, for example, he had won over $5,000 before his two opponents had earned a cent!  One of them gave him a run, but faded toward the end.  Now the question for Mr. Jennings is:  Who Wants To Be The First Jeopardy Millionare?  We shall see...

      I've always liked Senator Bob Graham, and believe he would make a fine Vice President for presumed Democratic nominee and fellow Senator John Kerry.  He's a moderating voice to Kerry, and would be a great geographical balance to the ticket from a state that means a lot in this campaign.  Not meaning to read anything into it, but  urlLink a couple of notes from a column in today's St. Petersburg Times  provide some interesting insight.  Kerry is expected to name his running mate early this week, and some are saying Graham is on his short list.  Personally, though, if I were a gambling man I would put my money on North Carolina Senator John Edwards.  His youth, energy, and the fact that his own presidential campaign began to gain in addition to the Southern factor are all in his favor.  My guess is that Graham would be number two on the list.

      I have never been a fan of vouchers to subsdize students attending private schools with public funds, and I am less so today after what happened this week here in Polk County.  It also shows that it is not just a few shysters on radio and television who lie and steal in the name of the Lord.  According to a  urlLink story in the Lakeland Ledger , a woman who claims to be the "Overseer and Prophetess" of a local church and founded a private school was charged with several members of her family with taking over a quarter million dollars of McCay scholarships and federal breakfast/lunch funds and putting them to personal uses such as rent, entertainment, comedy show tickets, nail and beauty care, among other expenses.  While former teachers at the school said that payroll checks often bounced and students didn't have enough books and other resources, she lived in one of Bartow's most expensive homes and bought a $53,000 Humvee.  Do you get the idea there's something wrong here?  That's not only stealing, but using the position of a minister to deceive and steal.  There are always a few bad apples in every bunch, even among those who attempt to do go and spread the Gospel.  You know, I believe there is a special place in Hades for people like this.

      It's a quiet Friday here in Imperial Polk County...the heart and soul of the I-4 Corridor.  Looking forward to a nice, quiet weekend.  Always a welcome thanks to Tommy for the mentions he has given this blog past, present, and future.  Said mentions have come up this week in both his  urlLink Sticks of Fire  and his new Tampa Bay blog list,  urlLink TampaBlogs .  SOF is always a great commentary on what is going on in the region, and I don't mind saying that it was a bit of an influence on this blog...or attempt at one!  And TampaBlogs is beginning to show just how the blogging community is growing not only in Tampa Bay but throughout Central Florida.  Wheather you like a strongly political tone like  urlLink spacecoastweb: blog , if your're more of a historical junkie and would enjoy  urlLink South of the Suwannee , or just randon thoughts from  urlLink DaveDorm  from everything from the Bucs to software, you can find a blog for it in Tampa Bay.  And on many, including this one, you can respond to what you read.   Love to hear from you!

      GREAT NEWS for all you rock 'n roll fans across central Florida!  October 8 will be one night to enjoy some really wonderful music, but you'll have to pick your show, and it's all for a cause.  MoveOn PAC, the fundraising arm of the political organisation  urlLink MoveOn.org , is sponsoring the Vote For Change Tour featuring some of the biggest names in music during the first week of October across several key "swing" states.  Friday, October 8 is Florida's night, with shows in six cities at the same time, three along the key I-4 Corridor.  The pending schedule, subject to change:  Kissimmee:  Pearl Jam, Death Cab for Cutie  Orlando:  Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, R.E.M., John Fogerty, Bright Eyes  Gainesville:  Dave Matthews Band, Jurassic 5, My Morning Jacket  Tampa:  Dixie Chicks, James Taylor  Jacksonville:  Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, Keb' Mo'  Miami:  John Mellancamp, Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds  My son, who is 24, says Gainesville is getting the better show due to Dave Matthews and Jurassic 5.  Sounds like Tampa's getting the short shrift.  Wouldn't mind seeing Bruce and the boys in O-Town.  All the artists concerned are united in their support of getting Bush out of office ASAP, and it's unusual that Springsteen agrees to do anything of a political nature such as this.

      I didn't get to watch but the last half of Tuesday night's Democratic U.S. Senate candidate's debate that aired on the state's NBC affilates.  For the most part, it was pretty cordial with all three candidates taking much the same positions on many of the major issues.   urlLink Former USF President and Education Commissioner Betty Castor  continued to take the high road, with  urlLink Congressman Peter Deutsch  seeking to highlight his experience within the Beltway.  Playing the attack dog much of the evening was  urlLink Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas ...not so much attacking his opponents per se, but in the context of his look and attitude during the debate.  Penelas, who in recent polls has been in third, sought to focus on where his positions were different from the others, a smart move less than a month away from the primary.  It seems rather strange that the heavy discourse between Penelas and Deutsch has virtually become nil now that Castor has taken the lead in most polls.  The two men were going at it hot and heavy at the beginning of this campaign, but now that Betty is up front Deutsch's attention has turned toward alleged ties between her campaign and  urlLink EMILY's List .  Castor's campaign manager previously worked with the organization that helps Democratic women that support their positions get elected to office, and Betty has been endorsed by them.  GET OVER IT, PETER!  The Republicans get their chance next Tuesday in Daytona Beach.  It should be more entertaining, with  urlLink Mel Martinez ,  urlLink Bill McCollum ,  urlLink Johnnie Byrd , and  urlLink Doug Gallagher .  Byrd should be the wild card, with his numbers dropping like a rock and needing to make a big move quickly he may say something that'll be seen to be very bright or very stupid...or both.

      Just a quick note before heading out for another day of hard work collecting past due telephone bills...  Reading the latest musings from  urlLink Florida Politics  this morning, there was an interesting link to  urlLink an editorial from the Florida Times-Union , which basically advised the Republicans not to worry.  I personally liked the last paragraph of the editorial:   One campaign is fueled by hatred, and one is based on a love of this country and concern about its future. One or the other will win.     The problem the folks in downtown Jacksonville have is...they must have the parties confused.  The Kerry-Edwards team loves this country and is truly concerned about this future.   Hope is indeed on it's way!

       urlLink Capitol Hill Blue  reported last week that President Bush is taking powerful antidepressant drugs to combat his erratic behaviour, depression, and paranoia, and  urlLink another article in the publication Friday  reported that the Commander-In-Chief is withdrawing more into his own world in which only his closest loyalists are welcome.  Now before you start dismissing these articles as Democratic propaganda, let me mention a couple of things for your consideration.  Capitol Hill Blue has been around for nearly ten years, and is one of the oldest news sites on the Internet.  And for those of you who question Internet news sites, remember that it was such a site ---  urlLink The Drudge Report  --- that broke the story of then-President Clinton and his affair with Monica Lewinsky.  If, indeed, the story is factual...God help us all, and pray that they keep the person with the "nuclear football" as far away from him as possible.  Hopefully after November 2 we can look forward to new leadership at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
