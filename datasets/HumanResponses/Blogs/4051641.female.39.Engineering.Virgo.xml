       Today wasn't awful. I didn't kill anyone or get killed. Trixie met me with a Latte in the parking lot at work. Paid bills, accomplished stuff at work, and thats pretty much it.   Except for the stripper incident. Got a can of the most powerful stripper for the throne project. Started stripping the throne outside on the porch, and it started to sprinkle. I picked up the chair, and was carrying it into the summer kitchen, when it slipped out of my hands. I tried not to drop in, but did anyway, and it got stripper on my face and shoulder. Ow, ow, burning..I ran into the kitchen, and blasted water over my face til it stopped burning, and wiped everything off. It's okay now, but I just feel dumb about it. The Darwin Awards people will be knocking on my door tomorrow..dumbass.   I shall report back on Sunday with tales of Virginia. Should be interesting.

      Well don't you know. It's been one of those financial hell kind of days. Last August, I set up a whole payment schedule thing with these collection freaks. Alls well, happy, happy, they get their bucks, I get a nice letter with the amount my account is down every month. Cool.(10 payments left) So today, out of nowhere, I get a phone call from some other company regarding this account. Saying that the company that had it before turned it over to them. But didn't give them my banking information (by federal law, he said...) I pitched a fit, said no way, I wasn't informed, and I'm not planning on giving anyone any banking info over the phone until I get a letter or some kind of information here. Annoying as hell.   Then I got home, and on the door is taped a notice about my back taxes. Yeah, yeah, shut up and pay your taxes, I know, I know. But dammit, I don't own any property, and I don't have kids in school, so why the hell should I? Sheeeesh. I'll break down and send them something, just to get them off my back. Not likely that I'm going to be visited by the tooth fairy with a bucket of money tonight.   Tomorrows payday (Exchange day) and I'll hold some money in my hands for about 20 minutes. Thats okay. I have more than some do. And sooner or later, I'll make the ends meet a little. I'm better now than I was a year ago, thats for sure.   Out of nowhere, PackRat called me to go to dinner last night. First time I've seen him in months. He was coming thru and thought he'd say hi. We went to the Chinese Buffet (Imagine) and then for a Ritas. Talked a bunch, of course, he told me about his new honey, who is quite the sexual creature. Thats about it, apparently, because she isn't interested in much else. How boring. Don't get me wrong, sex is great, but I can't imagine not caring about anything else. He sees her once a month, and she's happy as a clam and says she's in loove with him. How nice. My theory is that he's telling me all this to find out if I'm still in love with him. Just because thats how he is. I'm not, but I do miss flea marketing and other stuff with him. He's a whiner, so I don't miss that. Miss Nympho can have him. I have no desire to start changing his diapers again. All in all a semi-interesting evening, and we shall file it under 'whatever'. I told Trixie about it today, and she got all shitty with me, "I don't even know why you bother" in that tone of voice that makes me want to pinch her til she cries. So I just didn't talk to her until after lunch. It's tiresome, she's like a little miniature version of Hootie. At least I can tell her to shut the hell up.   I cut the grass, so now I can go to VAGirls with a clear conscience. I'll run the vac after work tomorrow and I'm done for guilt chores.   I've got to get some more powerful paint stripper. This orange strip stuff is all happy and goopy, but dosen't strip the paint for shit. At this rate, I'll be stripping paint off this chair as my nursing home project!! Off to Lowes or Homie D, and ask questions tomorrow. At least in some places, I'm thru the white gunk, and into the red. I'd like to see the grain of the wood soon. The throne is outside now. It'll stay out there til the paint is all off.

        Happy Wednesday.  Another day at the salt mines, or more like sludge pits.  It's another day with my half assed computer, since Mr. I.T.  is lacking in the 'T' department.

The Stooges wanted to stick their noses in the stuff, so I set up barriers with the water jugs so they wouldn't.  Morons.    Stacey IMed last night and told me she has to work late Friday, so it'd be best if I'd wait til Saturday to come down.  YEESSSSS!!!  I didn't want to drive thru that crazy 70>470>95 Beltway shit on a Friday night anyway.   It's a better thing when I leave early, early, early in the am for trips like that.  I'm thinking I'll come back up 95, and maybe, just maybe sleaze into the IKEA on the way home.  Killing two birds with one stone.  Weird dream this morning:  Sitting at the intersection of Trindle Rd and 15 in Camp Hill.  Looking toward Lemoyne (but there were way more trees around) when several planes flew overhead.  I thought to myself, "Wow, look at those big planes, they're flying low"  then one of the planes nosedived into Lemoyne.  Big orange explosions, and lots of flames.  Then I looked right, and bombs were falling, more explosions.  I forced myself awake.  It was very weird, but I remember thinking in the dream, "Holy Shit, Wheres Dad?"  and "Mom is going to freak!"  Yeah,  yeah, is there someone to sue for delayed post traumatic stress disorder?  Lmao.  I've never seriously considered suing anyone.

Kind of takes the fun out of work without the good old computer to mess around on all day.  I'll be nice, and do the book that Brooooce brought out.   I'd hate to cut into Trixie's forum time.

       Got home last night, laden down with a case of canning jars, a case of cat food, 5 pounds of sugar, 2 newspapers, eBay goodies (purple bra and shirt..nice) and various others things. In other words a full load. Goatie was by with my eggs, so add 2 dozen eggs to the load as well. I unlocked the front door, kicked Petecat out of the way, and started unloading my burden. Kicking off my shoes, I headed toward the kitchen. Alas, the trail to the kitchen was blazed with several piles of cat yack. Not just hairballs, I'm talking big yukky half chewed up crunchies, in big piles. Which I was unaware of. That is until I stepped in one and it squished up between my toes. Niiiiice. Really nice. Gagging and hopping on one foot, I got to the kitchen without dropping the eggs. Guess it wasn't all bad.     Time: 7pm ish. August 18, 2004   After cleaning up the kitty piles, and reading the mail, and all the general after work wind down stuff, I decided it was time to start the marmalade project. (Marmalade makes me think of that snotty guy in Animal House, Greg Marmalard...never mind) Peeled the peached, peeled the oranges, got the pot boiling. Cooked the sugar/water thing. Followed the directions to the T. Or so I thought. 3 Hours later. I have 8 half pints of peach/orange/sugar syrup. Okay, maybe it'll jell up overnight. This morning. I still have 8 half pints of peach/orange/sugar syrup. Hmm. Think something went awry? Guess so. Back to the drawing board, and toss the first batch in the trash. At least the jars can be salvaged. (Sauerkraut was the night before. It was cheap to make, we'll see in a couple months if it's any good or just botulism waiting to happen)  Picking up Daddy-O after work for the great trip West. Should be a hoot, or at least blog worthy.

       Oh, but isn't today just griiiiiinding on? Dear Lord. Minor excitement this morning, what with possible internet downage, and the Big Guy wanting, no, NEEDING these plans and specs RIGHT NOOWWW.. Oh my. Trixie is also being above and beyond her usual snotty self these days. I haven't inquired as to WHY, all I know is that she's really starting to get on my nerve. More than usual. Say it ain't so.        I got an email from Lars today. He and his family are off to Iceland for a 10 day holiday. Alas, he's too busy, so he'll only be able to go for 5 of the 10. He's very busy at VO, and they are, as always, running out of funding money. I kind of miss Lars, in his snobby ecogeek sort of way. He was quite a vault of information.      No JB last night. I came on later than normal, due to the great canned sauerkraut experiment. That was a big mess, what with cutting the cabbage into small pieces by hand, as opposed to using a slicer. You do with what you have, right? I think it took in the canner too, the lids made the funny 'thonk' noise, I guess we'll see in a month or so. Tonight will be the big peach adventure. Stay tuned. Anyway, no JB last night, and dammit I kind of miss him. I guess Miss Paranoid is rearing her negative ugly head, but I'm waiting to hear him say, "I met someone I like better" or "My old girlfriend came back to me" or "You and I just aren't going to cut it." or that old chestnut, "I love your chest, but you're just too fat." (Old chestnut in the sense that I hear it in my head, not in the sense that it's ever been said..) Nice, really nice. He's probably just all fucked up over this new job. I know how he gets about that kind of thing.     Press on.

       How do you like that?!! My post from the weekend didn't take. I suppose it took me too long to post it. Oh well. It was just random bitching about life in general. Which, I suppose is what this whole thing is about anyway!      To recap: JB had his second opinion w/the Doc on Friday. 2nd opinion doc says, "Lose 20 pounds.." Which is not what JB wanted to hear. So he's going to proceed with the surgery. In keeping with my extreme nosiness, I HAD to google it.  urlLink http://my.webmd.com/hw/sleep_disorders/hw48958.asp#hw48960  Oh maan. Sure wish I didn't. Yuck. He's going to be a seriously unhappy camper for two weeks, easily. I wonder if I'll be the supportive friend, and be around for him? I'll try. It'll be a test for me. I'm very fond of him, but we all know what kind of tolerence I have for "Wah, wah, wah" The part that bothers me the most is the line, "There is no good evidence on the outcome of using uvulopalatopharyngoplasty for obstructive sleep apnea" I'd sure hate for him to go thru with all that for nothing. I've tried to talk him out of it too. But he's got himself convinced it'll help. Plus he's also got his nerve up for the surgery. Poor fuck. I'll do what I can.      Friday was also spent with the House of Poole. We all went to the Lions Club Fair for Ox sandwiches (except for Princess Drama, who threw a big fit about eating ox. Oh the horror!) Anyway, it was a typical family outing to the fair. Pook was very stylish now that she lost all kinds of weight due to her anxiety, so she was sporting low cut jeans and a tank top that showed her midriff. Hey, whatever. Personally, I think she's been reading too many 'fashion' mags, but thats just my opinion. Hunny pretty much took charge of the kiddos, and sheparded them onto rides, and all around. Pook did manage to take Princess Drama over to one of the games, where we spent about 10 bucks so PD could win a 6 inch high Care Bear. Love the Fair. No Hootie though. She emailed me that afternoon to inform me she was taking the night off from running the bingo tent. "I'm bingo-ed out" she said. Which pretty much blew my idea of surprising her out of the water. I expressed that, and she thought it'd be swell if we all would stop by. Didn't happen, Pooles drove, and I wasn't trying to herd PD and Jr into Mom's house while all they wanted to do was eat junk and ride rides til they puked. No scathing email from the Hoot in response to my no-show. Hopefully she re-read my email telling her I wasn't driving in the first place. She's due for her pre-beach snit. More on that at a later date.      Saturday I met George in New Oxford. He's a nice enough guy, and we had an okay time walking around looking at way overpriced antiques, and a mediocre lunch. We parted as friends, and haven't talked much since. Whatever. I then proceeded to drive all around Adams county looking at the orchards and enjoying the green hills. Stopped at a tourist place, and got some peaches and corn (per JB's request) and found some applewood chips for smoking meat. YAY!! I think Saturday night I tried to post this the first time. Alas.       Sunday, AM with Daddy-O. Breakfast at the Legion w/the usual suspects, then groceries and home. I was doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen when JB showed up (Unannounced, I might add) with a hankering for lunch. We went to The Garden, had soup and egg rolls, then he took me of a tour of all the luxury car lots in the area. Volvo, BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar. THAT was entertaining. I wonder if I had the ways and means to own a $40,000 car would I? (ooh, that needs reworded...or not) Anyhow, after the car thing, we passed several lovely hours on the couch again. Nice, very nice.

       It seems like I've spent the last two days driving up and down Rt. 81 or 15.  Hey, guess I really have.  Last evening I went to the House of Poole, and we took the family to the great Lions Club Fair.  OMG, now I know why I moved away from there, and will never move back.  Jeeesus..what a bunch of freaks!  God.  Nope, sorry mom, I'm NOT moving back home.  Pook and I got our Ox-wiches, though.  Princess freaked out hysterically because she didn't want to eat ox,  so she got a hot dog, which she sniffed, and poked and finally said, "I'm not eating this."  and proceeded to bug the shit out of everyone else while they ate.  "I wanna ride that ride, I wanna play that game, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna" Jesus.  Made me want to get my tubes tied just because.  3 hours with them is like 24 in real people time.        Today I went to look at absurdly priced antiques.  Made me laugh anyhow.  But then drove around the countryside.  Sure is pretty around here.  I can say that much.  Apples and pears on the trees, green fields,  lovely.   Some fucker will look at that and envision McMansions and WalMarts going up.  OH hell we aren't going there.  I did get some nice looking peaches and corn, and some applewood chips for the smoker.  Never played with that, but smoked meat rules, so how bad can it be?      Now I'm starving (hardly) and it's late, do I get back in the car and drive for something, or do I eat a granola bar and shut the hell up?  I'm voting for driving.  Wonder whats still open?  I'm off to forage in Carlisle-land.      Ah, JB is pissed now.  He started in on his anti-60's America bullshit rant, so I just said that I'd had my cup of bile for the day, and goodnight.  He's pissed.  Oh well. Life will go on I'm sure.  He's working himself into a full blown snit about that surgery anyway because nobody can give him a better answer.  So he'll go have himself flayed open, and be supremely miserable for several weeks hoping it'll work.  Him and his excess throat tissue.  I still maintain there must be a better way, but he's convinced that the surgery is the best way to go.  Today he was tired, and his throat hurt, and blah, and blah and blah.  Jesus.  He needs to get out more and do stuff, and quit fretting about stuff.   I'm firmly convinced if he had more social life, he'd have less physical problems.  And he's all hung up on being old.  You're not old at 45 unless you WANT to be.  I'd am curious what kind of people his family was.  You know, like old before their time?  I guess I'lll find out sooner or later.  Dammit.  I'm hungry.  Get outta here..

        Yeah, yeah, so here I am, forgetting to post daily like I said I was going to.  So sue me.  Hey come on, it was a weekend of supreme weirdness.  What can I say?  Props to JB for making it interesting to say the least.  I have to work on figuring this one out.  He's all weirded out about the move, the new job and the surgery, and I can't say I blame him, but I'm interested in what will happen a month from now after the surgery/job/move.  He claims he dosen't want to lose the friendship we have cultured by sleeping together, but......I guess again it's just another pants situation, as in getting into, but not a relationship thing.  Having banned the words Friends With Benefits, the Queen will have to find a better phrase.   Also, the Handyman re-emerged, wanting to see the chair project, but I'm wondering if his taste in tea has changed somewhat since the last meeting.  3 emails, 2 phone calls, all in a 48 hour span.  I'm casting my vote for horny.  Must be the weather.  Yeah, thats it.  And people wonder why I stay away from other people.

       That was a fun weekend.  I left around 6:30 on Saturday morning, and took the scenic route to Fredericksburg.  Man!  How beautiful!  Lots of vineyards, and big open pastures with horses and cattle.  15 South is very nice and interesting thru Maryland and Virginia.  I was really digging it.  Even though I had no coffee.  (All the stops were on the wrong side of the road, or I was hurtling past them before it occurred to me what they were.  My own fault)  Stacey's family is wonderful, and they could not have been nicer to me.  We hung out on Saturday and got to know each other face to face.  It was fun.  I left Sunday around 3 to come home, via 95 (Oh cringe) but I went to IKEA as a reward.  I did good!  Didn't lose my everloving mind, and only spent 33 bucks.  So there.  Accomplished the dish towel thing.  Now I can throw out those foul disgusting ones I have, and gross up a whole new batch.  I also bought myself a new knife, not expensive, some vanilla candles, and those magazine holder things for all the cooking mags.  I got JB a half pound of coffee and some chocolate for his housewarming gift.  I wanted a clothes rack, but in the whole vast IKEA experience, I didn't remember clothes rack until I was in line.  Duh.  Oh well.  Another reason to go again soon, right?      Not much else blogworthy.  I'm having a blast reading these different blogs every day.   It seems like the ones I always go to end up having links to another one, so I read that and liked it too.  So now the favorites list is very large.  I can't read any at work because of the ongoing computer snafu (thanks Bruce)        Ooh...ate junk galore Saturday and Sunday, but am back to low carb world again today.  Didn't do the Pilates this morning, though, tomorrow is another day.
