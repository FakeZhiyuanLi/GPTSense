       so this is really my post for monday but im sittin here sunday nite with stuff to write bout so here goes. i hate the idea of desiny, we shape our own future, there is always a chance for us to fail, but conversley there is always hope, i don't like the idea that someone has already planned out my future, hence me not believing in destiny. i believe in karma (the whole you get what you deserve kinda thing). assholes will have assholeish things happen to them, good people will have good things happen to them. i believe in luck, except you get lucky because someone is out there watching out for you, not because you as a person are lucky. also i believe that there is a time for you to go, you cannot be afraid of death for that reasone, because you have a time to go, you may not necessarily be ready, but you cannot be afraid because there is a reason for you to go, which kind of contradicts the whole not believing in destiny but there's always exceptions to the rule. i also believe that it is possible to be released from fear, but first you must admit what you are afraid of and deal with it by yourself, no one will do it for you. i believe in true love, i just haven't found it yet. on the whole death thing, death is the last great adventure because no one really knows what it is like, it is a discovery for us all. Also to have knowledge is a collection of intelligence of known facts, to be wise is to admit that you know nothing. We as humans know nothing, we have destroyed our environment because we know nothing. Think about how much we don;t know: we have discovered 1.5 million different speicies of animals in the world. by looking at bugs from one tree in the amazon you could discover 20 new species, so we probably havent dicovered another 5 million species of things on the earth. doesn't that make you feel small? just because you are small does not mean you cannot have an impact in this world or the next, strive for excellence, live for the day because tomarrow it will be gone, also takes chances because if we never took chances how boring would life be? so thats it for now, oh yeh that cool girl that i was talkin bout, men whores, ugh, haha, but yeh ill talk to him for ya if thats wut u want so he'll leave you alone, i didn't before because i thought he stopped, o and he's really not comitted to you at all, i'll tell ya y if you don't already kno bout sat nite, n e way keep bein you b/c you is cool  anyway peace b rendan

This summers goanna be fun, surfing in RI, campin in maine, hockey, got a job. I get my license soon, thatll be sweet.Lacrosse season is finally over, what a relif.  Song of the week BOX CAR RACER: There Is  I faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor Where i laid and told you but you sweared youd love me more Do you care if I dont know what to say? Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me? Will I shake this off, pretend its all ok That there's someone out there who feels just like me, there is.

       Well these past few weeks in school have been okay. MCAS are over yay! I met this wicked cool new girl, cept i wish i knew if she was into dating me cause she just got hit on by this wicked horny boy who wanted to make hanging out in making out. Anyway high school kids- wow theyre weird sometimes. My friends rule as always. I need summer!! Surfing, beaches, money, thats where its at. Stanley cup finals start tonight, sweet! Go Clagary since Boston lost in the first round (dammit). have you ever thought about life, like why were here, how badly are we messing things up? I think that the Matrix could really happen, like were progressing twoards being able to make people think that the virtual reality they are experiencing is real, someones goanna try it. If not, we may already be in it, and the system will just reset before we invent the technology to create one. Go Wachusett

       so after two, count em, two requests to update i am doing so. summers been pretty cool so far. jobs fun, been hangin with friends, realxin actin all cool, playin some beebop outside of school. yeh so i have many questions on my mind right now, most of which can't be put down here cause they involve all sorts of crazy cats. i'm thinkin of growin my hair out, like a hockey hair cut, where the hair kinda curls out the sides of a hat, since i wear hats sooo much. my sister got back from quebec today, dam i was just gettin used to the quiet. anyway opinions on the new idea for a haircut would be cool. i was supposed to go to a party tonight but the ppl didn't call me so i guess im not, which is why im sittin here right now, srry no deep thoughts today. oh yeh also what do you guys think of dashboard confessional-i mean are they good? cause im goin to see them sunday. also sorry for my lack of grammar, i just let a stream of conciousness go when im writing this, ill try to improve, eventually. anyway if people want to do some stuff this summer call me.

       you know what the one question that really doesnt have a correct answer is? Its How do I look? when asked by a girl to a guy, if you say you look good, theyll be all like ure jus saying that and if you say they need to touch up their makeup skills then teyll be mad at you for hours...even days on end. so my grandparents came out from hawaii this weekend, theyre pretty cool, im sayin this now cause i dont remember meeting them, ever except when i was a baby, which i also dont remember, you know what else i dont remember...what i had for breakfast. i saw my cat throw up that was gross

       so we were out playin wiffleball, cause its what we do and i found this super ball in some bushes when i was lookin for the ball, so i throw it at the house and it makes a wicked loud sound a rockets off the house, and it lands near the kids house it is, he picks it up and throws it into the woods and im like hey it was a superball, and he goes well it was dead anyway , and i go no it wasnt it flew pretty well off your house, it was funny. and then while this was going on my brother got attacked by a tree and got stuck in it so he hada fall backwards down a hill to get out and he stood up with like cuts all over, it was hilarious. well tomarrow is the last day of any classes (especially leschkes yay) then finals, then schools done! gooo class trip

       well ive been away this weekend, lifeguarding lil kids, which is fun cause i get to tan a lot. personally i think that raining ducks would be hilarious. also i hate the union, they take medicare and obra out of my paycheck..booo... damn union (grumble, mumble grumble). so i went out mini golfing fri nite and like it wasnt a date, but i pretended like it was and i was able to be myself because i wasnt thinkin about it(thanx to your guys advice) so that was cool. also personally i think anyones (guys answers) to girl problems is self confidence, confidence is sexy, and i think that girls would agree, so guys self confidence are your key words in this post. ummm...i needa pee hold on...ok im back...wait why am i writing about what i am doing at this ver y moment? (stops to ponder) anyway, finals are comin so that means schools almost over, yay! summer rules, so im goanna go eat lunch, hasta la vista baby

       ...there's a lady who's sure that all that glitters is gold...well its 11:36 pm out time, or 9:36 in Arizon, i wish i was there. anyway just finsihed my history final yay! EMilys up with me cause shes doin it too, but shes not done, ahahaha/ anyway it being late, me hyped on caffine and listening to Stairway to Heaven has lead to some deep thinking. First of all i hate choices when it comes to things like love and stuff like that. So like that whole Matrix idea of youve already made the choice, youre just hear to understand why you made it, yes i know exact quote and i havent seen the movie in like 6 months, anyway it kinda gets me thinking. if that true then why do we agonize over the coices we have to make, weve already made them so our lives will just reflect that choice, and if weve already made the choice, then we shouldnt agonize cause we cant change the choice weve already made, and that being said we just hafta stop agonizing over choices and try to understand why we made the descision weve already made, can you see where im goin? like if i hafta choose between two girls for instance, i shouldnt be trying to choose someone and asking myself which one should i choose, i should just go with what my gut tells me and then try to understand why i did it. get it? well then im jus goin with my gut instinct on descisions from now on and then im goanna try to understand why  i made those descisions, instead of agonizing over deciding. ...and shes buying a stairway to heaven

       ok well its tuesday, it sucks still cause were not out of school. yeh lotsa ppl are depressed these days...well thats it for that thought, ummm my parents are stupid cause they like never let me have any time alone with like friends because they seem to suspect me of something. the class trip will be sweet, supposedly someone rly wanted me to go but adam wont tell me who (angry shaking of fist. also when people complain about how nobody likes them in their blog they find out someone had a crush on them so... i hate how nobody likes me, mebbe that will work.scheneways my parents wont take me to get rise of nations cause they think i spend too much time on the comp anyway, which isnt true, but they are jus puttin off the inevitable. we had tacos for dinner, jus thot id let you kno, they were good. so today i was gettin all worked up over schoolwork and stuff so i went for a walk through the woods with my dog, and it was so peaceful, i wish life could be like that, humans could learn a lot from nature. so i kinda jus sat there on a hill lookin over this pond and admired the beauty while my dog ran around sniffin at stuff, i think thats as close to heaven as we can come, so now im all relaxed and feelin good which is...good. so song of the week cause i said so is LAST TRAIN HOME by Lostprophets One! Two! Three!  To every broken heart in here Love was once a part, but now it's disappeared She told me that it's all part of the choices that you make Even when you think you're right You have to give to take  But there's still tomorrow Forget the sorrow And I can be on the last train home Watch it pass the day As it fades away No more time to care No more time, today  But we sing If we're going nowhere Yeah we sing If it's not enough And we sing Sing without a reason To ever fall in love  I wonder if you're listening Picking up on the signals Sent back from within Sometimes it feels like I don't really know whats going on Time and time again it seems like everything is wrong in here  But there's still tomorrow Forget the sorrow And I can be on the last train home Watch it pass the day As it fades away No more time to care No more time, today  But we sing If we're going nowhere Yeah we sing If it's not enough And we sing Sing without a reason To ever fall in love  Well we sing if we're going nowhere Yeah we sing if it's not enough And we sing Sing without a reason to ever fall in love  But we sing If we're going no where Yeah we sing If it's not enough And we sing Sing with out a reason to never fall in love To never fall in love again

       well this week had been long and boring, pretty much this girl turned her old boyfriend gay ( i hafta be careful bout wut i say cause u neva know whos watching) yeh he likes to touch boys boobs now, which is weird cause he does it in the hallway to me all the fricken time, n e way i had a lot of good thoughts about what to put on here today in school, i just forgot them, adam that movie in history was pretty good i thought, so my new theory is that since i don't have any money i don't have a girlfriend cause like it costs so friggen much to go anywhere so i can't ask anyone out because i dont have the money to pay for them, which i would do cause im a gentleman, also sometimes high schoolers are way toooo emotional, and hookups with dirty girls are baaad (yes i did it once, but im a reformed person, i need to get my drivin time in so i can get my license in july, and adam when i get rise of nations ima beat you, and i need to go see shrek 2 and harry potter and chronicles of riddick, so anyone who wants to come well do it, go to the movies i mean, not really do it, unless youre mike then mabye, no jk, but tell me what you think about volleyball, sport or no, i think its a demi-sport, like its a sport cause you compete and you exert yourself physically, barely, but like its volleyball, n e way whats your opinion on it? also i just did this post in two sentences, i dont know if leschke would like my grammar skills but i thought it was cool.

       i am pissed. i think that ADD and ADHD are total bullshit. im sorry if any of you disagree but i really think that it is. these 'diseases' and their 'treatments' are just a way for parents to get out of watching their 'overactive' kids, who are just trying to be kids and kids are active. and these medicine that they inject into the kid is not doing them any good, the kids are still developing and the drugs dont help. also any kid has a short attention span, kids are just forced to grow up too fast in society today and their minds arent ready to pay attention in school for that long, and the teachers just cant put up with that. so any parent who thinks their kid has ADD or watev, SUCK IT UP, kids just need exercise, like puppies. and now i saw an ad for adult ADHD which is also total bullshit.   also im goin to RI for a week so ill cya next sat

       adam and adam will remember my red journal from last year, like freshman year i mean. i was lookin through it today and it inspired me to write a song. so heres the song Waking up to the buzzing Memorys still fuzzy The girl by your side Last night, and still, your pride  She's perfect She's pretty The butterflies have left already When you found her There was no chance Until you asked her to dance  Time flies by people come, people die Twenty bucks in your pocket You won her heart Time flies by  The friendship was fun The benefits are done Love leaves as soon as it comes Apbrutly blindsided by a train  Shes perfect In every way The butterflies have left already Why can't she stay? END  I know its far from perfect but mebbe ill revise it later. ITs supposed to be about love that leaves as quickly as it came. wadya think?

       well to start off sorry my posts have been so infrequent, i have been busy. ill try to be better about it. soo sat was fun, i got to see kim...yay.. oh yeh and everyone else too. To bad i couldn't stay later, but the cookout was sick. Me and a couple of friends started a bonfire in an old grill and we sat out there until twelve jus puttin on wood and relaxin, talkin bout stuff. That was the most relaxed i have been for months, then our parents came out in a drunken stupor (margaritas +beer + seafood = funny) and made us go to bed. somethin about the fire at night was very relaxing and fun, im goin to invite you all over sometime and we can do it. i played hockey today for the first time in a long time, that was excitin, jus flyin around on the ice, exhilirating, i really think i should have been born with skates on my feet, its a very freeing feeling. i ordered a sweet new stick today, that should come in a few weeks, i cant wait. I also cant wait until i go to Rhode Island to surf and jus chill in a house on the beach, listenin to Jimmy Buffet sippin a soda, watchin the sunset over the water, that is heaven. If you haven't been to Block Island you should go, last time i went it was sooo beautiful, theres this bech called like Mohican CLiffs or somethin, but its the most beautiful place on the east coast, im seriously goin to have to like die there or somethin, that would be heaven. also The Very Best of the Eagles cd is great driving music. cy a guys lata

       sooo summers goin awesome. i went to someones 40th bday party, that was crazy, rutland fireworks, eh ok. weekend was fun, i went golfin today, i sucked, and we walked all 18 so ima sit for awhile. concert was fun, i forgot to put that in. in a couple of weeks im goin down to RI to surf and goin to block island, which has this beautiful beach that i want to live on. and umm i also think, now more than ever that looks dont matter too much as far as the opposite sex goes. i mean you dont want to go out with a shemale, but a decent person i fine by me. personality is big because if youre goin to hang out with someone for a long time. but again not a whale. also im goin to adams party on sat, big time fun rite there. (no sarcasm intended) hows everyone doin by the way?

       well i have a few thoughts to share with you people as of right now.  first i think cancer sucks major balls, and that it is definatley a good thing that people work so hard to find a cure. second (and you can find this in my profile) i hate how pregnant women feel like society owes them somethin. society owes you NOTHING, the reason is first it is natural to procreate and you are just making sure humans survive, evolve, rule the world, etc, no reason to be bitchy about that, second society didn't make you pregnant, your husband/boyfriend/lover/random guy at bus stop (i mean no?) did. they owe you, not society, also i do not care about what you say about the pain and stuff like that, its natural, i know it hurts, but i didn't make you pregnant, so go talk to your husband. third i have figured out why guys think about sex all the time. we need to always be ready to fertilize the egg that comes around once a friggen month, so we are always ready so when the egg is ready, we can fertilize it. ha now you can't blame a guy being horny on himself, its nature, some guys are just better at controlling it (like myself jk) than others. fourth i am happy that kim is back, and i hope to see you guys soon, just not at school. oh wait another thought, people should have figured out that oil prices would go up sonner. If you have a finite supply of something, and more people start to use it as it runs out, the price goes up as the demand goes up and supply drops. simple supply and demand economics people. ok peace

       so i saw the bourne identity for the first time, and i hafta say what an awesome movie. so now i reallly must go see the bourne supremacy. hey did you guys know that august 14th is going to be tax free? no tax on stuff you buy, so like its the actual price, not plus 5% which is shibby. also i stole adams word. and i think bonfires are sweet. so anyway go shopping on aug 14th. i kno i will, wow that sounds like a commercial, sorry. anyway i'll leave you with a quote to read, whoever guesses who said it first, gets a special prize. "i think we've all arrived at a good place, emotionally...acumenically.........gramatically" peace
