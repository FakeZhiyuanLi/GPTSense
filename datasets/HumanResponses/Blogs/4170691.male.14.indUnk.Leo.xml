      i havent updated in a while so i am just doing this so that that all my devoted fans (the two, maybe three people who care about my beautiful site) know i have not abandoned my site.  ive been messing around witht his cool computer nerd stuff and making like 3d things its really cool but nerdy but its ok, cuz ive established to the world i am a computer nerd.        now i could finish updating but i would rather go back and talk to morgan about smelling like pot and cologne.  by the way tomorrow (the first day of school) is my BIRTHDAY  im curently thinking about how to go about a party. next saturday im on a church retreat, but im thinking saturday AFTER that. but i only invite those who are very pristigous. or those who bribe me. or give me candy. or puppies.  by the way i might not have a birthday party so if you arent invited, it prob cuz i didnt have it. or its just me and my highschoolbuddies. (IM GONNA DIE FROM MISSING MY HIGHSCHOOL BUDDIES!!!)  ~tru  !#%&*$@ shout out to morgan carlson my bee-yoo-tiff-ull homedawg @$*&amp;%#!

      ok lets see i woke up at 12:00 ish and my sister was throwing my new shoes at me, so i threw them back at her and went back to sleep. i reawoke at like 2:00 (im such a bum) and immeditly went downtairs to get on el computadora. i was asked about my schedule within the first 5 seconds, so i typed that up, but before i finished that person left. i then put it all on my profile to shut everyone up. i then was walkin aroud the house and all of a sudden i found my grandmother. not the one who spent the night last night, but the other one. they apparently switched out while i was asleep. (my family also moved to florida, came back, got a pet elephant, demolished our house, rebuilt a new one, and hired a million flamenco dancers to dance on my face, all while i was sleeping.) ok and so then it was arranged (behind my back) that we were going to go see (prepare to laugh long and hard) princess diaries2 (omg) haha it actually turned out to be surprisingly: prepare yourself: shit. uh huh i know shocking. then we went to CPK and i ate too much maceroni and cheese :) and i died. oh right thats not until later... then we went to baskin robbins and i got a shake and then we came home and i got on the computer and... and  then  i died.  ugh i feel fat right now. i think ill go barf. i want to be just like ashley olsen, or one of her sisters, mary and kate. oh, haha such sillies! Mary, Kate, and Ashley... ok so im gonna do whatever she does wether its be bulemic or anorexic or be on drugs or all of the above. or maybe i should pretend im a cat!  goodbye  by the way sadly we (by we i mean i) are still getting angry letters (by letters i mean IMs) from annoyed fans (by fans i mean random people) in regards to the post from two days ago. and we must say we have enjoyed each letter from each fan.  also by the way, feel free to post a comment. i made it so anyone can comment on any post. no need for membership! bye!  ~tru

      hmm yesterdays post was very interesting...  raise your hand if you are one of the many who sat there, looking at the part about the shoe size correlating to something else and wondered..."hmm is he serious? i wonder..." cuz i never gave a staright answer...... i have a friend, and i swear she said "OMG TRUETT NOW I REALLY WANT TO KNOW" and i quote! haha dont worry morgan carlson i wont tell who you are!  ok, today i went over to my gramma's house and swam and went to the park and stuff. then i came home and all fo a sudden it was night and i snuck downstairs to watch tv and saw a cockroach roughly the size of montana crawling an inch away from my hand and so i went back upstairs. i then read my new dave barry book mostly commenting about exploding cows, snails, pigs, human stomachs, potatoes, whales, and municipal toilets. and then i slept.  the end  by the way i think ive just about given up on the whole idea of writing a fanfic cuz maleah wont write hers and i never get around to it.  hallie thought i actually killed my dog! lol i havent killed her yet silly!  ok seriously the end  ~tru

(i wanted something like maroon five, or seether, or shrek 2 soundtrack, somehow we left with ala-mo (alanis morissette) dont get me wrong i am a bit of a fan of al, she was awesome in dogma, but i would have gone with seether.) then we went over to famous footwear and i just kinda was like hmm oh theres the first pair i see! lets get them! and we tried on shoes and i ended up getting 12s, (insert 'yes it is true what they say about people with big feet' joke here)(it is)(lol)(no seriously) lets see, uh then we came home my mom got mad at me for buying the book (though she loves dave more than i do) and... i laid out my clothes for the first 3 days of school,... my D*** F***ING DOG F***ING RIPPED UP MY F***ING FAVORITE PAIR OF F***ING SANDALS (THAT BI*** WILL PAY WITH HER LIFE),... my mom said i had to finish to kill a mockingbird but i got on the computer anyways,... and i didnt get the chance to update till it was like 1:30 in the morning, but there is a place on here were you can decide on the time to say it was posted, so i intend to use a time machine to go back in time and post. arent i fascinating?!!? i can also use my time machine to go forward as far as 11:59 p.m. on dec 31 of 2006! oooh neato!  omg i ought to work on my fanfic just like MALEAH!!! >:O  ok raise your hand if you enjoyed my colorful language in this post.   i am so f***ing serious that peice of s**t is gonna f***ing die.  ~tru  P.S. if you were offended by the comment about shoe size being equivelent to the size of another body part, go cry about it to your self cuz i dont give a cr**. (you think im kidding about it? HA! buy me a drink or two and ill show you) ... O;-)  and on that note, i leave you.  haha look at the time it says i posted! ..........................\/\/\/............................
