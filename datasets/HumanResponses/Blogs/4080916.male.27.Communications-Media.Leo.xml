      Having just recently discovered the joy of blogs, I decided to start my own. This decision was not a result of me believing my thoughts merited other people's time or interest, but rather it forces me to write those thoughts down. Yes, I know that's what a journal is for, but in a journal I tend to write more of what happened to me that day than what I was thinking about that day. Of course, when you go back and read, the thoughts are far more interesting than the events.  Another reason I am starting this is because I have been Gospel Doctrine teacher in my ward here in Brooklyn for the past year and have just been called as early morning seminary teacher for the coming school year. I feel that this might serve as an appropriate place to express thoughts and hopefully receive ideas and/or feedback. I am in my element when teaching Gospel Doctrine. Seminary, however, is not Gospel Doctrine.  A quick explanation of the name of my blog: nine moons is the amount of time Coriantumr spent with the people of Zarahemla. Considering the cultural differences but spiritual similarities, I can only imagine the discussions they had in those nine months. Mormon blogs fascinate me because I love to see the different cultural perspectives of members from all over the world discussing Gospel principles.

      Shortly after attending a Stake conference and hearing one of the Stake presidency give a talk on business, businesses and ethics I was scheduled for a temple recommend interview. As "luck" would have it I was interviewed by this member of the Stake presidency.  After finishing the regular questions I asked him about his talk. Being in the movie theater business and being open on Sundays and showing our share of "R" rated movies I was interested in his thoughts. He explained to me how he felt about the entertainment industry and especially the problems with "R" rated movies. He told me that if he were me he'd get out of the business.  We talked for about 20 minutes. He concluded by saying that he wasn't telling me to get out of the business, but if he were me, he would get out.  I came out of that interview a bit defensive, justifing my position, but then again trying to be humble and obedient.  My question is: Is "advice" in an interview like this "counsel" that should be taken and obeyed? Or is it just an opinion that should be taken like anyone else's opinion?

      What happened to visual symbolism in the Church? Does it even exist anymore? Aside from the few examples in the temple ceremonies, I have a hard time coming up with examples of any visual symbols that we recognize as church members (Sorry, but a CTR ring is an acronym, not a symbol). Yes, I understand that there is symbolism in the way we live our lives according to the covenants that we make. But that begs the question: why don’t we portray it visually? (and I’m not talking about a Greg Olsen painting of a deacon passing the sacrament...)  Let’s take architecture for example. The Salt Lake Temple. Almost every decision on that building contains a symbolic meaning: from the number of levels of windows, to the sun, Saturn, Earth, moon, and star stones, to the direction it is facing, to the ascension from one room to the next, etc. The building is drenched in symbolism. What purpose did this serve? Because it looked nice?  What do we have now? Nice buildings in which symbolic ideas are presented and symbolic acts are performed. Hey, what we do inside is what’s important, right? Of course that’s right, but why the shift? Was Brigham Young just a bit overzealous? Is visual symbolism something of the past? Is it too hard or too expensive to do nowdays or does the Church purposefully avoid it? I know there have been attempts, but I’m sorry, the [Statue of Liberty] torch doorhandles inside the Manhattan temple just don’t cut it for me.   Another example: Greg Olsen, Robert Barrett, Del Parson, Arnold Friberg paintings. If I were to assess the Church based on the art it spoonfeeds to the public, I would think that the Church’s stance on the Book of Mormon is that it’s a bunch of stories about strong, Anglo men. The policy of the Ensign magazine is that there is no conceptual art allowed. Are we chuchmembers not smart enough to understand symbolism?  When Picasso abstracted his paintings he didn’t do it because he didn’t know how to paint (boy could he paint! At age 15 his paintings rivalled Rafael!), but rather because there were deeper insights he was trying to communicate. One of my favorite paintings of all time, and one of the most touching paintings for me is Kasimir Malevich’s Black Square (to see a photo click  urlLink here , I don’t know how to add photos yet).   I don’t necessarily mind the paintings of those Mormon painters, to visualize a narrative, but I have a very difficult time extracting gospel insight or meaning from a single one. Shouldn’t that be the role of our art? To give meaning and insight to our lives as we try to live the Gospel? Art as narrative plays that role by proxy. It might give meaning, but only because we know the story behind the painting, not because the symbolism of the piece inspired us.

      This week as I prepared my lesson for Gospel Doctrine class, I realized there is a short list of possible Plans of Salvation, as proposed (or implied) by those in the scriptures. They are as follows:  1) No agency. All are saved. This was Lucifer’s original proposal.  2) Agency. All are saved. See Nehor (Alma 1:4) and Corianton (Alma 42:1)  3) Agency. Suffer a little bit. All are saved. See 2 Ne 28:8.  4) Agency. Only those who repent are saved. See Jesus Christ, Alma 41-42, rest of scriptures.  This fifth one isn’t in the scriptures, however... 5) Agency. Nobody is saved because there is nothing after this life. See New York City, 2004.  We know from Alma 42 that under the conditions of option #4 the demands of justice are satisfied. Fine.  Under the laws laid out by Alma, the demands of justice wouldn’t be satisfied in the examples of #2 and #3.   Option #5 is a different beast which I won’t address at this point, although I’m up for hearing any opinions as to how justice would relate to it.   Lucifer’s original proposal, however, is intriguing to me. From what I understand, the demands  of justice would be satisfied in that case. Because there is no sin, there is no need for an Atonement to satisfy the demands of justice. Does this mean that Satan was well aware of eternal laws (that even God is bound to) and proposed his plan accordingly? It seems that once Satan realized his original proposal wasn’t going to happen, he’s been trying to implement numbers 2, 3, & 5 ever since.

      Is God funny?  I don’t mean this in the casual sense where we attribute humor to God because something ironic or terrible happend. I mean it in it’s most literal sense? Does He make jokes? Does He laugh at our jokes?   The question calls to mind a conversation between Jerry and George on Seinfeld:  JERRY: I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor. GEORGE: I never heard him say anything really funny. JERRY: But it’s common sense. He’s got super strength, super speed.. I’m sure he’s got super humor. GEORGE: You would think that, but either you’re born with a sense of humor, or you’re not. It’s not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth. JERRY: Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth? GEORGE: I don’t know but he ain’t funny.  That’s not bad logic. God is all-powerful, all-knowing­—why wouldn’t he be all-funny?   I once heard a story about President Kimball (anyone feel free to prove this to be a mission legend) and one day he exited his office laughing. Someone asked why he was laughing, after all, he was in there by himself. He responded that he had just told God a joke and they laughed together (boy, in the retelling it sounds even less true). Now, regardless of the veracity of this story it has caused me to examine the question. I mean, when we say the perfect word at the perfect time, does he laugh?   This, of course, leads me to the question (assuming an affirmative answer to the first): of what stock is God’s humor? Lamentably, I must admit that the majority of that which makes me laugh comes at the expense of someone else—in some way, shape, or form. Conversly, my late grandpa received great joy from good, clean puns, of which I received more joy making fun of the pun than laughing at it. But I rarely found one to be funny.   So what is Divine Humor?

      I proposed and interesting thought in S.S. class the other day.  First I expressed my hope that the Millenium would hurry up and get here.  Here's why.  I don't know for sure if I'm Celestial material yet...hopefully I am, but I still have a lot of problems and sins to overcome (just ask my wife) anyway, I'm pretty sure I'm a good solid Terrestial type guy.  If I die and go to Paradise I will have some time there to "pay" for my sins and change as best as one can in a spirit body.  If I remain long enough in Paradise then maybe I can clean up my act enough to get a Celestial resurrection at the begining of the Millenium.  If the Millenium comes now and I'm Terrestial I get to stay on the earth, I have another 43 years until I'm twinkled.  During that 43 years there won't be the temptations around anymore that there is now.  It has got to be much easier to live a Celestial life then.  The children born during the Millenium will grow up to salvation...it'll be like the Nephites after Christ visited them and or like living in the city of Enoch.  So I think under those circumstances I can make it from Terrestial to Celestial.  Then I'm twinkled into a Celestial body and I have another 957 years to perfect that Celestial body so I can be ready to be exalted when the big judgement day comes.  I'd rather take my chances in the Millenium than in Paradise.  I know I should do it here in this earth life, that's what it's for and all that...but it's hard!!!  My point is that we shouldn't be discouraged by the gospel and the thought that we aren't good enough or can't make it into the Celestial Kingdom.  God's plan of Happiness is designed to save as many of His children as He can within the bounds of justice and mercy.   Think about the progress we can make in perfecting ourselves during the Millenium.  1,000 years is a long long long time.  With Satan bound because of the righteousness of the people the whole expereience is going to be considerable better than this one.  How much more can we learn and do in our progression when we don't have to worry about Satan, about striving to earn more to get a bigger better whatever.  Time, what a glorious earth-thing it is and we can use that 1,000 years to qualify to be Celestialized.

      Yesterday in Gospel Doctrine I asked a question that I have pondered for years. Is it better for us to screw up and repent (through the experience we learn and grow) or to never have messed up at all? It stems from Alma’s discussion with his son Helaman when he implores him to learn wisdom in his youth. This seems to be pretty good advice. However, Alma was a great prophet who accomplished great things, yet he wasn’t very wise when he was in his youth. I can somewhat understand the sentiment of not wanting his son to go through what he had to go through. But I wonder, was it because of his early experiences that made him the great person that he was? I mean, how much greater was his empathy now to those in wickedness because he had gone through what they were going through? I personally have never had any problem with tobacco in my life, therefore it’s difficult for me to be empathetic to those with tobacco withdrawls. Someone that was once addicted and has overcome the cravings can sure help that person much better than I can.   (which brings up the interesting question of why wasn’t Alma more empathetic to his wicked son? He may have been. Or maybe that’s not what his son needed at that point. I’m not sure. But that is a topic for another day)  So is it a question of empathy? I mean, if we never screw up how can we relate to what others are dealing with? It’s really hard for me to have empathy on the prideful...I have no idea what that’s like...  Or is it a question of experience in order that those after us don’t make the same mistakes? That then leads to another question: from which people do we better learn our lessons? Those who have sad experience then overcome, or those who teach solely by principle?  Jesus Christ never screwed up, yet he seemed to know all the right answers and was not that bad at empathizing either. We learn in Alma that, “he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.” Yet that doesn’t come through experiencing sin.   CS Lewis said something very intersting about temptation: “A silly idea is current that good people do not know what temptation means. This is an obvious lie. Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is... A man who gives in to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later.” This reasoning ultimately leads us to Christ, and that he perfectly understands temptation, therefore he perfectly understands each one of our situations, therefore he can be the merciful being that he claims to be.  So does that mean by my resisting temptations I can be empathetic? That I can say, “I know what you are going through?” I’m not quite sure. But I’m also not convinced that that is the purpose of repentance and overcoming sin. Maybe it’s just a perk, to be empathetic to those around you who are struggling.  The quick answer to the question is that it’s better to never screw up in the first place. However, we live in a society where we make poor decisions all the time and there is a mountainfull of goodness that comes from those experiences that probably wouldn’t have existed otherwise. I just don’t know if it’s as black and white as one might initially presume.
