      A friend on Backwash.com posted a link called  urlLink 10 Foods You Should Never Eat.   It was depressing because I realized that half these foods have been a staple in my diet over the past few years.  I had a good night at work.  I really do have a love hate relationship with waitressing.  It's stressful, unreliable, and I don't not get benefits like health insurance...but at the same time, it nice to walk out with $126 in cash after a six hour shift.    The closing date on our house was supposed to go through today.  It didn't.  Instead we're looking for lawyers.  I'm optmistic.  I think if we scare them enough, they'll drop the fight and let us buy it.  Otherwise, we'll be suing for everything from a breached contract to labor and supplies and rent that we now will have to pay.    I just want a place to call home.  And a gmail account.  Anyone have an invite?

      1.  I got an interview today.  It's actually for a job in my field.  Fingers crossed.  2.  It stormed here horribly today.  I was driving on the Parkway at the time, which is probably one of the most dangerous roads in the city.  I couldn't see a thing and hydroplaned all over the place.  3.  Watched "Miranda" with Christina Ricchi.  Not that great.  The boyfriend's obsessed with her...I'm not quite sure why.  4.  I feel like I'm cheating on backwash.com with a blog.  5.  The closing date on our house is supposed to be tomorrow.  Instead we have to find lawyers because six crazy redneck siblings decided they can't get along and want to screw us over in the process.  6.  I talked to my mother, SO's mom, the realtor, my SO, an interviewer, and my best friend on the phone today.  That has to be a record.  I'm phonaphobic.  7.  Leno was pretty fun tonight.  I'm not looking forward to going back to a normal schedule where I have to get up early.  8.  I spent 6 years in college, yet I'm too lazy to send a copy of my transcript to get the actual diploma.  Maybe I'll do it tomorrow.  9.  Maybe I won't.  10.  I can't wait to get a real job so I can know what a weekend feels like.  I have been a waitress for over 5 years.  Any longer and I'll have to change my name to Betty Lou and wear support pantyhose.

      I'm new here.  Welcome me with love.    This is my first "Blog".  I have been a columnist over at Backwash.com for 2 years, but lately have been seeking a place to let loose with less professional writing.  AKA. I can be a jerk.

      Then why can't I find a decent one for my boyfriend's birthday.  Anything I find in a search is tacky and fake (well, yes, even for a garden gnome).  Our house finally closed.  They're putting a roof on it right now and a shower in this weekend.  Hopefully we'll be moved in my next week.    I don't think it has sunk in for either of us yet that, yes this property is ours.  We can paint, plant, tear down whatever we want- but we also have to mow the beast of a lawn.    That's all for today.  If anyone who reads this has any knowledge of where to find a nice little gnome, let me know.  Also if  anyone  is reading this, drop me a note.  I'm starting to feel like this blog is kind of pointless.
