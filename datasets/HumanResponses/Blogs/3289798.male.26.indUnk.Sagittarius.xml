						   I've been gone all weekend with my wife for a romantic getaway to Indianapolis with about five hundred other couples for a marriage conference.  I was leary, I must confess, at the start thinking, "We have a great marriage, what do we need a conference for?"  And I was also wondering how I was going to be able to sit through seminar after seminar from boring teachers.  Well, I was wrong.  It was one of the best weekends my wife and I have ever spent together.  Learning about what it means to love each other and being warned of the many things that could ruin our marriage.  The speakers were hilarious, and we just had a fantastic time.  It didn't hurt that my wife is wonderful and I got to spend lots of quality time with her, someone else paid for the weekend, my wife is beautiful and I got to spend a ton of time together with her, the Pacers won, and we got to eat some very, very good steak for dinner on Friday, and my wife is incredible and...  Add that all together, and I'm telling you...It was a Weekend to Remember.  They should call it that...wait, they do.  If you're interested in attending one, and I would recommend it highly to anyone from the engaged to the couple who has been together for fifty years check out Family Life's website www.familylife.com for more information.

						   You wouldn't think that the place to go to learn humility would be to the one who has a right to be proud, but that is exactly the place that we must go.  It is in God that we see the most worthy accepting of glory and honor, and He is eager to accept it.  He should be.  He is God.  But, it is also in God that we see the most absolutely incredible demonstration of humility that has ever been witnessed.      Philippians 2:5-8 (NASB95)     5 Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ      Jesus,  6 who, although He existed in the form of God, did      not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, 7 but      emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being      made in the likeness of men. 8 Being found in appearance as a      man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of      death, even death on a cross.   Here it is God Almighty reduced himself to the form of a slave and served His creation by allowing Himself to die the most humiliating of all deaths, crucifixion.  That is the Creator God of the Universe.  I think that C.S. Lewis put it better than I've ever seen it stated.      "In the Christian story God descends to re-ascend.  He comes     down; down from the heights of absolute being into time and     space, down into humanity…But He goes down to come up again     and bring the whole ruined world up with Him.  One has the     picture of a strong man stooping lower and lower to get him-    self underneath some great complicated burden.  HE must stoop     in order to lift, he must almost disappear under the load     before he incredibly straightens his back and marches off with     the whole mass swaying on his shoulders.  Or one may think of     a diver, first reducing himself to nakedness, then glancing in     mid-air, then gone with a splash, vanished, rushing down through     green and warm water into black and cold water, down through     increasing pressure into the deathlike region of ooze and slime     and old decay; then up again, back to color and light, his lungs    almost bursting, till suddenly he breaks surface again, holding     in his hand the dripping precious thing that he went down to     recover.  He and it are both colored now that they have come up     into the light:  down below, where it lay colorless in the dark,     he lost his color too.     In this descent and re-ascent everyone will recognize a fami-    liar pattern:  a thing written all over the world.  It is the     pattern of all vegetable life.  It must belittle itself into     something hard, small and deathlike, it must fall into the     ground:  thence the new life re-ascends.  IT is the pattern of    all animal generation too.  There is descent from the full and     perfect organisms into the spermatozoon and ovum, and in the     dark womb…the slow ascent to the perfect embryo, to the living,     conscious baby, and finally to the adult.  So it is also in our    moral and emotional life.  The first innocent and spontaneous    desires have to submit to the deathlike process of control or     total denial:  but from that there is a re-ascent to fully     formed character in which the strength of the original material     all operates but in a new way.  Death and Re-birth – go down to     go up – it is a key principle.  Through this bottleneck, this     belittlement, the high road nearly always lies.      The doctrine of the Incarnation, if accepted, puts this prin-    ciple even more emphatically at the center.  The pattern is     there in Nature because it was first there in God.  All the     instances of it which I have mentioned turn out to be but     transpositions of the Divine theme into a minor key.  I am not    now referring simply to the Crucifixion and Resurrection of     Christ.  The total pattern, of which they are only the turning    point, is the real Death and Re-birth: for certainly no seed     ever fell from so fair a tree into so dark and cold a soil as     would furnish more than a faint analogy to this huge descent     and re-ascension in which God dredged the salt and oozy bottom     of creation."  ("Miracles"  New York:  Macmillan, 1947, 115-17)  We all need more humility.  I think this is the place that we find it in its truest form.

						   Character is who you are when no one else is looking. - Mark Redmond  I'm sure someone else said those words before my English/literature teacher, Mr. Redmond, said them to my class in seventh grade.  I was scared to death of that man in the beginning as I was quite the hyper-active kid and he had zero tolerance for any talking or goofing around in his classroom.  I remember hearing several times "Obviously you have no character, or you wouldn't be talking right now," and I would always wish, pray, and hope that someday I would have half of the character that man had.    You see, Mr. Redmond's wife had chronic rhumatory arthritis and had a constant migrane headache that I remember only a few times in my life where it was even bearable for her.  Even though his wife had these ailments very early in their marriage, this man loved his wife.  He loved her dearly and cared for her and their two children with as much compassion as I've ever seen.    He still to this day is loving his wife and children, though they are grown up now, and continues to teach English/literature in a small private school.  I was thinking about him today as I wrote him a letter and I wonder if I'll ever have even half of the character that that man has.    The man is a hero of mine.  The man with the most character that I have ever known, and the man who challenged me and continues to challenge me to this day to be what I need to be when no one is looking.

						   It's amazing the effect that simply caring for someone and showing them compassion can build a bridge and create deep friendship.  I'm reminded of this as I am at the hospital with a lady whose daughter is in surgery for the next eight hours.  It's kind of funny because I've got a lot on my plate this week, but it's as if the Lord has just placed a peace on my heart knowing that there is a peace that He is bringing through me to this family.  I know it's making my week busier, but what would our Lord have done.  He dropped it all when a lady who was despised in her culture, considered unclean.  He dropped what he was doing to stop and have a conversation with her.  What would Christ do?  It seems trivial in light of all of the bracelets and billboards, but what a great question to ask ourselves when faced with the decision to care for ourselves or care for others.    Mostly, I'm just convinced that I rarely take the path that I've chosen today, and I'm reminded as I sit here that letting go of my selfishness is really the place I should be.  Well, I get to go sit with a mom who is nervous about her daughter so I'll see you at the next post.

						   I got a little worked up last night and ended up staying up til after 1:00 in the morning just watching game 3 between the Sac Kings and the Minn T-wolves.  The Kings looked like queens last night I have to say until the end of the fourth when they actually started cutting and passing like they do when they're playing their best.  Too little too late and the Wolves take a 2-1 lead in the series.  I got pretty worked up as I saw Sac failing to execute a good game plan, and I was pretty convicted when I woke up this morning at my apparent passion for the way someone played a game wrong, and my apparent lack of passion and getting worked up when I fail to do what I know, from the Scriptures to be right.    It seems that I am quite the hypocrite often as I can fail to see the need to be angry with myself in my sin, yet I can be plenty angry at someone else when they don't play basketball the way I think that they should.  Do we really love Christ?  "If you love me, keep my commandments."    I'm ready for Game 4, though.  I'll be sitting on my couch tomorrow night, enjoying the game, probably getting pretty worked up.  Hopefully, though, with a clean consience that I have worked passionately to make pure with Christ's help in my life today.

						     I woke up this morning wrestling with thoughts of the madness and depravity of the world we live in.  The situation with Iraqi prisoners, The Red Cross and the wrong blood given to the man in Atlanta, the finger pointing that is associated with every problem that the world and any one in it faces, and I remembered who was and is and will always be in control of it all.  Begin to contemplate the Deity who holds all things in the palm of His hand and be taken to a place where the rest does not matter.  Be blown away.  "There is something exceedingly improving to the mind in a contemplation of the Divinity.  It is a subject so vast, that all our thoughts are lost in its immensity; so deep, that our pride is drowned in its infinity.  Other subjects we can compass and grapple with; in them we feel a kind of self-content, and go our way with the thought, "Behold, I am wise."  But when we come to this master science, finding that our plumbline cannot sound its depth, and that our eagle eye cannot see its height, we turn away with the thought that vain man would be wise, but he is like a wild ass's colt; and with solemn exclamation will tnd more to humble the mind, than thoughts of God..." - C.H. Spurgeon

						   It's been way too long since I've added to this.  An excuse is in order, but I'm fairly sure that I cannot come up with one that is any good, so I'll leave it there.   It's been crazy here.  Very busy, but it's been good.  Very, very good that the Pistons now have a 3-1 lead on the Lakers and will most likely put an end to the Lakers misery on Tuesday night.  I watched last night as the Lakers seemed obsessed with complainging to the referees, and I have heard interviews with several of the Lakers team, including Shaq, Phil Jackson, Kobe, and others and it seems that the farther they get behind in the series, the more the finger pointing elevates.  "So and so won't get me the ball enough,"  "If I were to get more shots, but so and so is so selfish,"  "The officiating has not been what it should be."  These are grown men who are unwilling to take responsibility for the loss in a game.  We see children do it all of the time, but these men ought to be able to stand up under the pressure and scrutiny of the spotlight and take the blame themselves. It's been that way from the beginning, though, and sometimes it takes an entertaining basketball game for me to look at myself and see how often I point the finger at someone else intstead of confessing and moving on.  Adam and Eve started it in Genesis and we've been pointing fingers ever since.   Well, I've got a lot of studying to do today, and a lot of other work as well, so...see you, hopefully sooner than later.
