      I'm getting ready to go camping for a week, and as I pack, the thoughts are start going through my mind, that we here in a America revolve SOOOOO freakin much of our lives around our apperances.  Don't get me wrong, I am like any other American, and I don't have any problems spending $100 on shoes, but I never really thought about exactley how much we do, until now.  Take camping for instance (being that it is the inspration for this post).  I'm going to be in the wilderness for a week.  Ok, the only people around me are going to be doing the same thing, and I'm sure that the people I am going with have seen me at worse anyway, so why am I packing my make-up?  I'll tell you why.  Because our society says it is the thing to do.  In fact, it not only seems wierd to pack everything I usually use to get ready in the morning, it's wierd NOT to.  We work all week, (well I don't, but SOME people do) just to pack up our trailors and tents and pretend we are homeless??  Except now, camping isn't cool.  Staying in a huge trailor as big as your house is though.  Becuase again, society says so.  So you know what?!?!!?!?!?!  I'm freakin rebeling.  I'm not going to get ready and do my hair and put on layers of make-up, just to walk to my campsite and play cards.  And I am sleeping in a good old fashioned tent with out a toaster or cable TV.  Wish me luck America, I'm ruffing it....

      The small, beautiful town of Roseburg, has been taken over.  Everywhere I go, I am surrounded, and can't seem to get away.  Music in the half shell, cosmic bowling (as many highly respected 11th graders enjoy), floating the river, and now even my school, have been pleauged.  With middle schoolers.  I know what you are thinking.  "HELLO, you were that age just a few short years ago" but I really DO NOT think I ever acted like that.  I just don't see it happening.  They have just recentley started to out number the high schoolers, and I am getting scared.  I can't go anywhere without seeing a group or two of jr. high aged kids, just trying to be cool, and fit in, but some of the things you see them doing...wow.  I can say that becuase my brother is in 8th grade, and as a reslut of that I am usually surrounded by these uh-human creatures.  I don't understand how they think.  They walk around like, "yeah, I'm cool..." but they aren't.  They are just young kids who are stopping at nothing to be accepted.  Middle School is a time of change.  Everyone is trying to figure out how they want to act, who they want to become, and so I guess they are entitled to being a little wired.  But, when it gets to the point that people are wondering what planet these creatures are from, its too much.  I am sick of hearing about partys that these kids who are 12 and 13 are having.  It makes me sad to realize that there are a lot of things these kids are doing that could and most likey will ruin there lives.  Most pre-teens today don't stop at anything to "be cool", and it's sad.  So I guess I am just asking for input.  Is is just me, or are the jr. highers of today crazier than we were?  Is it just me, or are they going a little bit TOO FAR.

      Well, that is a no brainer.  Everything is funny when you are tired.  I seriously think I laugh about 10 times harder at stupid things when I am sleep deprived, than when I am “normal”.  If I ever am “normal”.  But seriously, once, my friend Brooke and I stayed up all night before the District Forensics Tourney, and we were what you would call “high on life”.  We got into so many fights the next day because we were so tired, and we had some kid on our team tell us “See, this is what happens when you two don’t sleep”.  Whatever Drew.  But don’t you agree?  Do you laugh a lot harder when you are tired, and haven’t slept in forever?  I think everyone does.  There’s just something about laughing until your head hurts, ahhhh.  All right, this article could very well be a testament, because its really late, and I have a feeling that when I read it tomorrow, I will be like, yeah, that’s what you write when you are tired, dude.  But I guess we will see...for now I am going to go stay up until I laugh at my dresser, and other random objects with no comic appeal.  **Later Days**

      I spend a great deal of time wishing I was better at some things.  Like checkers, or scrapbooking.  That would be really fun.  Ok, random I know, so I'll get to the point.  Sure, I can debate the hell out of a "more money for medicare" bill, but that's just because I already talk so much that it's what I do best.  I wish I could be like Martha Stewart.  Ok, nix that actually becuase I kind of like my house, and I don't like showering with other people in big cement rooms, so jail isn't really my thing, but I wish I could do what she does.  I'm not exactley sure what the problem is either, because I can have the vision, and I know exactley what I want it to look like, I just...can't get it to.  I'm also not very good at mind games.  Crap, nix that too.  Ok, what I mean is not good at LOGIC games, (I'm very good at mind games, that's how I win in debate).  I can argue until I turn blue, and find a loop-hole in any bill, but I can't win at tic-tac-toe...I'm not exactley sure where this posting is going...I guess I'm just throwing out the random thought that I wish I could be more creative.  Oh well, whatever, I can write, sometimes, I wonder if Miss Martha can do that...

      I don't care.  I don't care what 'risk' you think you are talking.  I don't care how hurt you will get, or how much your friendship will be ruined.  I don't care if it's not the cool thing to do.  Tell the people you love, that you love them.  I don't get why we have such a secrecy issue.  But whatever, I guess it's the cool thing to do, to love someone with all you have, but not tell them.  It's too much work to let someone know how you feel.  What I really don't get is when we don't even tell our friends.  Like, yeah, I guess I see why people are "scared" to tell a crush, but if you can't even tell your best friends you love them?  What if something happens to them?  I guess I've been thinking about it a lot latley.  I had a scare a few weeks ago with one of my very best freinds, and I was so glad that I had told her.  I guess you have to think about it as yourself.  If you were going to die, from some random accedent or because someone was pulling a 9/11, would you want to know you had people who loved you.  Who would miss you if you were gone.  So, I don't care.  Stop making excuses.  Just freakin tell them.  **Later Days**

      People always try hard to impress you,  But you’ve got to understand its not them,  The people on the outside,  Are just reflections of what should have been.  No one ever acts the way they really are,  Everyone always goes that little step to far,  Its hard to like somebody  that isn’t really real,  Especially when the outside,  Is the only part that apears.  The inner beauty is precious,  its what we thrive on,  Because no one really knows their friends,  when all the make-up’s gone.

      David Lee Johns....What is there to say, he's fabulous...the kid is ultra ripped and way buff.  I myself have witnessed girls flock to the dude.  When David (or BD, if you wish) walks in the room, all the other guys are out of mind.  He is for sure, the best Roseburg has to offer...

      All that I am today, and all that I will ever be, has been inspired by one little girl.  I changed a lot during the transiton of 8th grade to 9th, and it is all due to one simple move.  Before that I was a loner.  Actually, that’s not true.  I had always been very talkative, and out-going with lots of friends, but for a while in Jr. High I wasn’t sure who I was, or what I wanted to be.  Then we got new neighbors, and everything was put into perspective.  They had a little girl, who was only four at the time, but was my everything.  She was sick.  She had cancer.  And as a component of that, she wasn’t able to do a lot of things “normal” little girls do.  So  I took her as my own, and played with her and read to her becuase she couldn’t do it herself. As soon as they moved in, I became attached to her, and spent all my time that I wasn’t in school, with her.  She got me through, and inspired me.  I believed in myself and what I could do, thanks to her.  I owe so many things I have learned in my life to this little girl, who will no longer have the chance to do anything herself.  Cheyenne died in January this year.  A peice of me is now gone, but will forever live in my heart.

      Well, the above titled is an understatment, becuase I know for sure that more than half all the posts I put on here are going to be about my friends, becuase that is mostley what my life is.  Right now however, as I am just starting my blog, I want to comment on the freinds that I hold so very dear.  Brooklyn, Bri Bri, and Rizz are always there for me.  Yeah it sounds cheesy, "These girls are  always there for me" but they really are, and always have been.  Brooke and I came to be friends becuase of a forced seating chart in 5th period sience, Brianna and Erika came a long this year at sophmore homecoming, and are like sisters now.  Through everything I have done this year I have always had there there to give me advice and laughter, and I don't know what I would do without them.  Always making me laugh, and ready to listen.  And even though I just met them all within the last two years, but the bond we have is unbreakable.  It's already gone through a lot of hard things, deaths, fights, cops, everything, but it is always there, and always lasting...I hope all of you reading this are as lucky as I am, to have friends you can't live without.

      I guess this is like a landmark of some kind, or maybe not...Maybe I am just a girl with a lot of time on her hands, who can't seem to fall asleep no matter how many Conan O'Brien re-runs I watch.  It's been a rough few weeks, but I think I am finally out of my slump, and back in full order...so I am going to go drink some hot tea and try to go to sleep, but mark my words, this is the first entry of many,  *Later Days*

        I'm a major night owl.  If it is 4:30 am on any given night, the chance that I am actually in bed like any other normal human, is very slim. Needless to say, if any of my friends need to talk in the middle of the night, or they just plain get home late and feel like saying hey, I'm the one they call.  Tonight is no different.  It's 1:50 am, I'm chillin, not tired in the least, and with nothing to do.  I always ponder late, this time of night, why people are sleeping?  Is it because most of my friends have to get up ad go to jobs (which I don't have), or is it because we are supposed to sleep at night, (that is what God intended)? I'm not sure, but for whatever reason, I'm the only one awake here at my grandparents house.    Sitting here in the computer room that I have sat in so many times before, I start to think about the wonder that children are.  I guess it is something that all children are born with.  The ability to make anything fun and exciting.  Something teenagers and even adults of today can not grasp.  I remember so many times that my cousins and I would sit in this room for hours on end, playing with a barbie or reading books.  Now I look at it, and all I can focus on is who is going to be online in the time I am allotted before my little brother gets his turn to serf the net.  I wonder why I can't have simple fun anymore.  I can't tell you how many times a week I catch myself or one of my friends saying "What are we going to do tonight, I'm bored", then I realize that what seems like just a few short years ago, we would have been yawning and asking for a story.  Back in the old days when things were simple, and you didn't worry about what you were doing in a month, a week, a day, an hour from now...You worried about if your dad was going to pick out the right barbie at Christmas, and if your mom was going to remember to get your favorite shirt when you went to grandma house.  You were satisfied with a plastic car and a few barbies, and you didn't need anything electronic to keep you occupied.  I wish things were like that now days.  I wish I could be occupied for hours with simple things, and never worry what tomorrow was going to bring.  I wish I wasn't so caught up in my "love story", or what is going to happen "next time I run into so and so who's going to beat my butt...blah blah blah".  I wish life were simpler again...Actually, right now, I wish I could fall asleep...

        You learn a lot by changing surroundings.  In just one year at the high school, I’ve learned more about my life, my goals, myself, than any other year before.  I’ve learned that teaching doesn’t come without learning, talking doesn’t come without listening, and love never comes without sacrifice.  I’ve learned that all the trouble that come from every broken heart, every failed test, and every emotional break down, is only making us stronger, and preparing us for the people we will eventually become.  As I watch my friends and I go throughout the pain and heart break of our teenage years, I sometimes with I could turn time forward, so that every issue that we struggle with would be over and done with, but then I realize that all the struggles we are constantly facing, make us who we are.  Without the drama we face in our teenage years, we wouldn’t have any experience to live on, and no lessons learned from past problems.  I’ve also learned that there is nothing that makes the world right again, like laughing.  Everything that is wrong in the world, and every issue I am facing, is forgotten when I am laughing the day away with my friends.  I used to care so much what people thought.  But, I’ve realized, through a series of unfortunate events, that I need to be who I am, and people can just deal.  I would much rather be doing what I want, when I want, how I want, with a few close friends, than being someone I’m not, with a bunch of people who don’t care about me.  The person I am when I am with them, isn’t fun.  She’s dull, and boring, and not worth anyone's time.  If someone can’t love you and enjoy you the way you are, they aren’t worth it, at all.  Perhaps that is the most valuable lesson I have learned.  That love is a chance you have to take.  I know it’s hard, and I know it is a gamble, but when you finally find someone that you love so much, you can’t think about anything else, you can’t sleep, and you can’t wait to see, all the heart ache you have gone through in the past is forgotten.  So, to sum it up, you can’t get through out high school, or life for that matter, without pain, suffering, sacrifice, and stress, but when all the obstacles of a certain problem are over come, the everlasting rewards are forever satisfying.

      It is Saturday night.  In Roseburg, Oregon.  Do you know what I am doing?  Singing "Red Neck Woman" by Gretchen Wilson into one of my bestest friends, Erikas, cell phone.  Boring, you ask?  NO!  Granted, if I felt like I was missing out on something, I would be upeset, but this isn't that bad at all.  So, if you are out at a club, or on a hot date, and you come home and get on this website to see what the losers are doing...we are online, writing for your sick pleasure, and enjoying ever mintue of it...

      I’ve just returned from camping.  What an experience.  I took a very dear friend, Brianna, and it was her first time...(like a virgin, as she would say).  Well, we were there for 5 days, and a lot happened.  The weather wasn’t that great while we were there, but we had so much fun anyway.  You learn a lot of things when you spend a long time period of time with someone, and I, like any other, learned on this trip.  For one, Brianna is a card shark.  I have found, however, that I can beat her at speed, if I hold nine cards in my hand at once instead of five, when she isn’t looking.  The second thing is, we are both very willing to try new things, such as swimming in the -54 degree water in the pouring down rain, or float down the VERY rocky river in just lifejackets.  The third thing, my brother and his friend, eat every single second of the day.  Here is how a typical day would go: Brianna and I would wake up at around 10 because Chris and Mitch would be so loud while they ate, then we would turn over and go back to sleep, only to wake up at 12/12:30ish, ready to start the day.  Then, we would usually go swimming, play cards, go swimming, go hiking a mile to the bathroom, go swimming, take showers and do CROSSWORD PUZZLES!!!  That’s another thing.  I found out something about myself on this trip.  I suck at crossword competitions.  Brianna spends a great deal of time at her dads house, doing crosswords, so she is really good, and I am...less than perfect.  Anyway, the week was eventful, and I had a blast, it’s been real Brianna..(Oh my gosh you guys!! He just drank, like a gallon, of chocolate milk...)

      My youth group left tonight, or today I guess, for Lake Shasta, California.  Now, sweet, they are going to have a blast in the sun, and hang out with each other, and be bestest friends, like any church family should do.  But you see, normally, I am joining them.  It is very rarley that I don't go along on a church trip, and everytime I have ever turned one down, it has been simply because, for one reason or another, I was not able to make it without a conflicting event.  Well, this time, I am not going.  I'm staying here in Roseburg, because I can not longer be around that youth group for extended periods of time.  Earlier this summer, I went on a two week trip to Mexico and Yosemite with this same youth group.  It was a blast.  I had the best time in the world.  However, many things happened on this trip that really bugged me, that I never took time to think about until I was reflecting on the trip later.  I don't want this to be something that seems like all I ever do is bring others down, but I guess it is where I vent, and if you don't want me to, don't read it.  So, a few things that happened, on this trip, really made me mad.  One, pretty much every guy under 18, including the "leaders" were so comsumed with the girls, the whole time.  We talked about this in my cabin more than a few times, how we felt like the focus of the trip was on hormones and not God.  Ok, so they are teenage boys, that is just what the spend most of their time on, girls, but NOT when you are on a mission trip.  I will say that I also spent time focused on other things than God, but they were constantly thinking about it, and you could tell.  Two, it seemed to some of us, that the only thing anyone cared about were the team relationships.  Sweet, relationships are a huge part of a two week mission, because when you spend two sraight weeks with the same people, you have a tendancy to learn EVERYTHING about everyone, but you don't have to make it bigger than the actual projects.  It was good that we were able to work well together and get along, but it was not as focused as it could have been.  So, why am I not going on a trip that everyone told me to?  Lake Shasta is a beautiful place, and I really enjoy all the time I spend there.  I don't want to ruin that by going with people who can't seem to focus on anything but girls and popularity.  So is that wrong?  Is it wrong that I can't go to my church and feel comfortable?  No.  It's not worng, to them anyway.  It's just REALLY, REALLY sad.

        So, I spent a few moments today with a kid who can’t keep his freakin mouth shut.  Ever.  I seriously think he is totally unable to just NOT say anything.  Like, for instance, my brother comes into the bedroom, and starts to talk to “Mr. X” we’ll call him.  Well, Mr. X just starts shit with my LITTLE brother.  And it gets me thinking.  What the hell does he think he is doing, as well as anyone.  Why do people think they have the right to bring others down?!  People do it to me all the time.  Big deal.  All I care about is what I think, and what my friends think.  And obviously I am not doing EVERYTHING wrong, because if you have read any of the other articles, you would know I have some pretty amazing friends.  Back to the point, I don’t understand what it is about some people who say whatever they want to whoever they want.  Now, I’m not saying in any way, shape, or form, that I don’t bring others down.  I do, just as much as any normal human.  But I mean those people who bring everyone down, all the time, everyday.  Why?  To make themselves feel better?  To make everyone else focus on the problems of others and not them?  I know I do it, I am the first one to admit it, but I always feel remorseful, and I wish I didn’t do it so much.  Most of the time, its something stupid that I don’t mean anyway, but Mr. X was just taking my brother down, and it made me mad.  There is no reason for anyone to continually bring others down, for whatever reason.  Ever.
