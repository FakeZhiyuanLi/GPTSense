      &nbsp;&nbsp; Ah to be alive on a mid-September morn fording a stream barefoot, pants rolled up, holding boots, pack on, sunshine, ice in the shallows, northern rockies.   Rustle and shimmer of icy creek waters stones turn underfoot, small and hard as toes cold nose drippingsinging inside creek music, heart music, smell of sun on gravel.  I pledge allegiance  I pledge allegiance to the soil of Turtle Island, and to the beings who thereon dwell one ecosystem in diversity under the sun With joyful interpenetration for all.  &nbsp; - Gary Snyder 1992

      "For Locke, property is a natural right and as such is prior to government, which is founded to protect men in the exercise of their rights. In much contmporary liberal thought, property and property rights are seen as deriving from the particular laws of particular societies. What difference do these accounts of the avrious origins of property make for the role of the state in the economy?"  the crux!

      a good one: &nbsp; DAY 21:  President Bush's 2004 official election campaign sells clothing made in Myanmar. This is in direct violation of Bush's own trade embargo against the country, one of the world leaders in sex trafficking, human rights abuses, and narcotics production.  The US is currently experiencing the worst textile industry slump since 1953, due in part, to inadequately enforced trade laws.  (Source: "Bush campaign gear made in Burma," Newsday, 03/18/2004. "4,000 textile jobs lost in 2003," Charleston Post and Courier, 01/14/2004. Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Burma, US Department of State, 02/25/2004.)   &nbsp; for those of you not familiar with mcsweeney's,&nbsp; it's a lit magazine put out by david eggers.&nbsp; some great stuff in there each issue. i highly recommend! (almost as much as i recommend reading all 78 reasons to dispatch bush that have been put forth so far.)

      what an interesting weekend... i spent most of it backpacking with my friend michelle. and on saturday evening, we ran into my first ever wild bear. a relatively large black bear sauntered across michelle and my path as we were hiking down the appalachian trail in the delaware water gap.  &nbsp; so, we had set up camp on mt. minsi, had a nice little snack, and were just enjoying the evening. since we still had a few hours until dark, we decided to walk a little further on down the trail and see if there were any nearby creeks. so we're walking and talking, the trail is good and clear, nice and flat along the top of the kittaniny ridge, and all of the sudden, michelle stops, and goes "Scott, this that a bear?" now, i have logged many many a mile hiking and backpacking through the wilds, having backpacked that very stretch of verdant pennsylvania several times. and i have never come across a bear. deer, turkey, porcupine, skunk, raccoon, coyotes, sure. bears? nope.  &nbsp; so i look at this big black shape about 100ft in front of us, around a slight crook in the trail, and i go "nah its just a..." and on cue, the big ol' thing just starts ambling across the trail. "... big freaking bear," i manage to eek out. "just don't move" i whispered. not hard advice to take at that point. and so it gets out in the trail, and is just about to cross back into the woods when it notices us, and swings its head around to have a staring contest. the adrenaline at this point was AMAZING and i just started calmning myself down, thinking about all the steps to take. ok, if it charges, there's some rocks over there i can get to them before it gets here, i can yell to michelle to follow my lead, and raise my hands above my head and start yelling and screaming and growling. all theories on keeping bears at bay that i'm familiar with, but was never really looking to test out. luckily, it never got there. seemingly satisfied that we weren't anything of interest, it just continued right on its path through the woods. michelle and i waited a few seconds, and then slowly started making our way the mile or so back to camp. once my head completely cleared, i realized that i had had my digi camera in my pocket the whole time...  &nbsp; since it was so close, and we had a good 12 hours before we broke camp, and had plenty of smelly food with us, we decided it was best to bag the rest of the&nbsp;trip and just hike the few miles back to the trailhead. it wound up being a really nice hike capped off by one of the best firefly displays i've ever been treated to. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Loaves and Fishes  ------------------  This is not the age of information.  This is  not   the age of information.   Forget the news,  and the radio,  and the blurred screen.   This is the time of loaves and fishes.  People are hungry,  and one good word is bread for a thousand.   --David Whyte

       Toxicity: Growing conventional cotton involves the indiscriminate spraying - both on the ground and from the air - of chemical toxins to eliminate insects, control weeds and strip the plants of leaves for harvesting.    In 1994, at least 50 million pounds of pesticides and over one billion pounds&nbsp;synthetic fertilizers were used in six major cotton growing states.    It takes about 1/3 of a pound of chemicals to make one standard T-shirt.    Accidental pesticide poisoning causes 20,000 deaths and 3 million non-fatal poisonings every year, worldwide.   Health Hazards:Originally formulated as nerve gases for warfare, at least 107 pesticide active ingredients are carcinogenic. Pesticides have been responsible for birth defects, respiratory problems, behavioral changes, infertility, sterility, hormonal imbalances and a variety of short-term maladies.  &nbsp; Water Worries:Pesticides contaminate ground water in at least 32 states, and half of the U.S. population relies on ground water for its primary source of drinking water.  &nbsp; Hidden Expenses:Taxpayers unknowingly pay out billions of dollars in annual subsidies, pesticide regulation and testing, hazardous waste disposal and cleanup, environmental damage and higher health care costs.  &nbsp; Children at Risk:Millions of children in the U.S. are exposed to carcinogenic pesticides through food, contaminated drinking water, household products and - for children who live near agricultural areas - pesticide drift.  &nbsp; Poisoned Ecosystems:Besides killing pests - which eventually become immune to the chemicals - pesticides are toxic to an array of beneficial wildlife, including fish, birds, bees, crustaceans, and aquatic organisms. The poison is passed along the food chain.  &nbsp; Soil Erosion:Despite recent improvements in soil conservation, dependence on a single crop such as cotton causes serious problems. Without crop rotation, key nutrients are depleted, resulting in topsoil loss.  urlLink

      The U.S. government is going into the red at the rate of $991,000 per minute.   The IRS website is maintained by a company incorporated in Bermuda.   Since 2001, corporate tax collections have fallen by $11 billion.   Halliburton has 15,000 workers in Iraq and Kuwait, 4,000 more than the number of British soldiers deployed there.   Less than 10% of the SUVs sold in America today will meet China's proposed fuel-economy standards.    If global-warming trends continue, 15% to 37% of the world's species will be extinct by 2050.   61% of Americans think the biblical story of the world being created in six days is "literally true".   75,000 The Passion of the Christ "nail pendants" were sold the week Mel Gibson's film opened.   61% of American workers say they received "no meaningful rewards or recognition" for their work last year.   71% consider themselves "disengaged" clock-watchers.     The cost of the Bush tax cuts this year alone is enough to give $9,793 to each of the 2.9 million people who've lost their jobs since he took office.   Revenue loss from the Bush tax cuts over the next decade equals Social Security's baby-boomer reserve.   Without Social Security, 48% of senior citizens would live in poverty.   In 2001, 476 more Americans died of malnutrition than from terrorism.   American adults have gained an estimated total of 150,000,000 pounds in the last year.   Suburbanites weigh an average of 6 pounds more than city dwellers.   One in every 115 Americans works for Wal-Mart.   Wal-Mart offers workers $1,000 in catastrophic health coverage, but they must pay at least $500 a year for it.   More than half of all Salvadorans would like to move to the U.S.   Alabama became the last state to repeal a ban against interracial marriage -- in 2000.  41% of Alabamans voted against lifting that ban.   Paperless voting machines were named the worst technology of 2003 by Fortune magazine.  The odds that two members of Yale's Skull and Bones could face each other in a presidential election are 1 in 26 billion.     Still Glass, Getting Lower  Working women make 79.7¢ on the male dollar, down from 80.4¢ in 1983. That's already adjusting for maternity leave and other child-rearing factors. If such choices are not factored in, women make only 44¢ on the male dollar. Female professionals average $10,000 less than their male counterparts. Over a 40-year career, that difference (compounded 10% annually) costs each of them $4 million.   What Did Bush Give to You?  We all know that the bush income-tax cuts were a boon to the richest Americans. But did you know that an executive making $1 million gets an annual tax savings of $63,211 -- more than the pretax salaries of three Wal-Mart associates combined? Here, the Bush income-tax cuts represented as an hourly take-home raise, across the income spectrum:    ANNUAL INCOME  TAKE-HOME RAISE FROM BUSH TAX CUTS  THAT'S LIKE _____ EVERY MONTH    $10,000  5¢/hr  ($8) medium Domino's pizza    $20,000  21¢/hr  ($36) basic cable bill    $35,000  43¢/hr  ($71) two Pampers Baby-Dry value packs    $55,000  74¢/hr  ($123) car insurance on '99 Accord    $100,000  $1.73/hr  ($289) iPod mini + 40 iTunes    $200,000  $3.72/hr  ($620) pair of Manolo Blahnik Sedara d'Orsay pumps    $1,000,000  $31.61/hr  ($5,268) 12-day cruise for two on the Queen Mary 2

      for those of you unfamiliar with mr. dick, he was a science fiction writer writing throughout the 70's. his stories are the basis for a bunch of big hollywood flicks, including blade runner, total recall, and the minority report.  he was an amazing person, no matter whether you believe him to be a prophet (as some do) or just plain old paranoid delusional. strong themes of paranoia and confusion, as well as shifting perceptions of reality run throughout his work.  so this little speech he gave never ceases to take my thoughts to interesting places, no matter how many times i read it. hopefully it will do the same for some of you.

      it was nice to get up this morning and be greeted by a little patch of blue peeking in through my window. it had been solid grey for the better part of a week. whenever someone asks me, "is it nice out?" my answer is always depenedent on the amount of blue i can see in the sky. tempertature, wind, and the rest are all secondary in my mind.  saw "anchorman" last night. very good flick. not quite as funny as napoleon dynamite, but its definately up there. a bit more low key than i was expecting. ferrell wasn't quite as out there as he was playing "frank the tank," but ron burgundy is a great character. and he is pretty out there, at one point proclaiming that san diego is german for "whale's vagina." steve carell of the daily show definately stole the show for me. and brick looks just like my uncle jon, which added a whole different aspect for me. definately recommended movie.  --------------------------------------------  the morning is full of storm in the heart of summer.  the clouds travel like white handkerchiefs of good-bye, the wind, travelling, waving them in its hands  the numberless heart of the wind bearing abouve out loving silence.  orchestral and divine, resounding among th trees like a language full of wars and songs                 - from "the morning is full" by pablo neruda

      so here is a pretty good inaugural posting for my little site here... mr. chouinard does a good job of laying out the rough edges of the case that i hope to make with my life, through words and deeds. patagonia is a fantastic company, solely owned and operated by yvon and his family. his is one of the last of the outdoor equipment and clothing manufacturing companies that has not been bought out by a corporation. one could make the argument that this better allows for him to maintain his vision of an ecologically sound, and progessive for that matter (patagonia essentially midwifed the organic cotton industry), business. it is when groupthink and the search for that holy grail, the bottom line, takes over that these ideas which are, for the most part, unprofitable in the short to mid term take over, and "externalities" become an acceptable byproduct of corporate business.  -------------------------------  Don't Buy This Shirt Unless You Need It  by Yvon Chouinard & Nora Gallagher   Featured in Patagonia's Late Summer 2004 catalog   Near the headquarters of Patagonia, on the central coast of California, the Chumash Nation enjoyed a good life for thousands of years. They lived in small villages and possessed fur blankets, intricate baskets and soapstone pots decorated with shells. They painted elaborate abstracts in mountain caves. In every village were game-playing fields and sacred buildings. Almost every day, most Chumash enjoyed a cleansing sweat in the village temescal. In each village was a granary for stockpiling food that would later be distributed to those in need.   Chumash traded exquisite olivella shells for black pigment, honeydew melons, pine nuts, wild tobacco and various herbs and salt. By the 16th century, theirs was a complex society of hunters and gatherers with a far-reaching, sophisticated trade network.   Other nations along the western coast shared this life. Gerald Amos, a member (and former chief) of the Haisla Nation in Kitamaat, northwest Canada, recalls a friend of his father who would leave home in the dark to paddle to his trapline four miles by water. He would spend the day walking the lines, checking and resetting the traps. “Along the way back to the boat, during the late fall and early winter, the coho salmon would be still in the creeks that they passed, so they would stop at one of these creeks and take a couple of coho, which they would clean and pack home in their backpack together with what-ever animals they had taken in their traps. The fish provided them with their supper later that night."   Such lives are often called subsistence, which brings to mind the barest, hardscrabble survival. But there is another way to look at them. At Patagonia we choose to call them “economies of abundance.” In an economy of abundance, there is enough. Not too much. Not too little. Enough. Most important, there is enough time for the things that matter: relationships, delicious food, art, games and rest.  Many of us in the United States live in what is thought to be abundance, with plenty all around us, but it is only an illusion, not the real thing. The economy we live in is marked by “not enough.” We once asked the owner of a successful business if he had enough money and he replied, “Don’t you understand? There is never enough.”   We don’t have enough money, and we also don’t have enough time. We don’t have enough energy, solitude or peace. We are the world’s richest country, yet our quality of life ranks 14th in the world. As Eric Hoffer, a mid-20th century philosopher, put it, “You can never get enough of what you don’t really need to make you happy."   And while we work harder and harder to get more of what we don’t need, we lay waste to the natural world. Dr. Peter Senge, author and MIT lecturer, says, “We are sleepwalking into disaster, going faster and faster to get to where no one wants to be.”   We might call this economy, the one we live in, the economy of scarcity.   Lest you think the economy of abundance is gone with the old Chumash, consider Europe. Europeans still buy only a few well-made clothes and keep them for many years. Their houses and apartments tend to be smaller than ours; they rely on public transportation, and small, efficient home appliances and cars. Europeans enjoy a 25 percent higher quality of life than Americans (while we consume 75 percent more than they do).   Or, look at the people of Bhutan, whose king insists on measuring “gross national happiness.”   Any person or nation can grow fatter and fatter, richer and richer, sleepwalking toward disaster. Or we can choose to remain lean and quick, wealthy in beauty and time and, that word that inspired our forefathers, wealthy in happiness.   In Patagonia’s environmental campaign this year, we looked at the plight of wild salmon and what it might take for us to become what Ecotrust calls “a Salmon Nation,” a nation of people who make choices that contribute to the health of whole watersheds and the economies of the people who live in them. A salmon nation is a nation of abundance, where people live in a way that fish can thrive. If you think this is an impossible dream, check out Seth Zuckerman’s essay "The Gift: Salmon Recovered" and learn how wild salmon rebounded in Alaska after the state employed sophisticated tools like sonar, stream bank counters and airborne spotters to ensure their salmon were not overfished. In the last two decades, commercial catches in Alaska have more than doubled.   At Patagonia, we are dedicated to abundance. We don’t want to grow larger, but want to remain lean and quick. We want to make the best clothes and make them so they will last a long, long time. Our idea is to make the best product so you can consume less and consume better. Every decision we make must include its impact on the environment. We make ski jackets that are the right jackets, with no compromises, yet they are elegant enough to wear over dress clothes in a storm in Paris. (Most ski jackets sit in the closet nine months out of the year.) We want to zero in on quality.   In the economy of abundance, wild salmon are given back rivers in which to run. Trees grow to their natural height. Water is clean. A sense of mystery and enchantment is restored to the world. We humans live within our means and, best of all, we have the time to enjoy what we have.

      so, i'm finally getting around to doing something that i've been meaning to do for quite some time... not sure if it will be a worthwhile endeavour for anyone but me. hopefully it will at least be worthwhile for me. a cathartic exercise at the least. a chance to add some cohesion to the ideas and feelings that i have in my day to day life. we shall see.  its drab and dreary here in nyc. but at least its not hot and humid. i'll take just about anything over hot and humid.
