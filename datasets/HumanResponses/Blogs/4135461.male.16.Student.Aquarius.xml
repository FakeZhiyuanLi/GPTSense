      It's been a while since Opie and Anthony went out and chilled with the fans, so in an effort to reconnect with everyone, the guys will be heading out on a PROMOTIONAL TOUR.Promotional tour, you say?We have it on good authority (several chipmunks died swiping this off the nice lady's desk at XM headquarters) that Op and Ant will be making several stops across the U.S. to promote their return, and their new show on XM Satellite Radio.   urlLink JUST IN CASE YOU DON'T HAVE ONE YET   Here's what we know so far:- Beginning in a few weeks, Opie and Anthony will start travelling to retail stores across the U.S.- They'll probably show up on a weekend in some retail store parking lot, somewhere that sells XM satellite radios (and has one of those nifty food trucks outside...the kind that make burritos)-  You can hang with the guys, get a hat, a shirt, an autograph, and oh yeah...  urlLink A Satellite Radio. -  Definite stops on the list: Boston, Cleveland, Buffalo, Philadelphia, and somewhere...in New Jersey.  It's been TWO YEARS, kids. Shit, some of you probably MADE kids in that time. TWO YEARS!!! So come out and say 'howdy' and get yourself some schwag and a satellite radio.Oh yeah... umm... Philly...you're first.Get F-ing Ready.

      i got this e-mail from opie very early this morning (12:15) : Hey guys!  It's official ANthony and I have signed with XM Satellite Radio and we couldn't be happier!  This is the natural next step for our show.  We get our freedom back to do  a funny, clever, entertaining and at times (wink wink) edgy show that our fans have enjoyed for the past 10 years!  We're still figuring out all the details but we'd like to broadcast our first show in over 2 years live from a venue to be named later on October 1st!  It's going to be a huge celebration.  Until then we plan on traveling the country visiting our fans to personally thank them for their support and turning them on to the excitement of XM Satellite Radio!Please join us today at noon at the Hard Rock Cafe on 57th street between 7th avenue and Broadway as we field questions from the media.........UGH!  Beer will flow! Finally, I want to take this time to thank our fans for their continued support over the past 2 years.  Because of you the Opie and Anthony show never officially went away.  The amount of O&A material that continues to be traded on the internet around the world is astounding!  Thanks to:  urlLink www.foundrymusic.com    urlLink www.wackbag.com   urlLink www.saveopieandanthony.net   urlLink www.oavirus.com   urlLink www.opieandanthony.net  Just to name a few!  See you at the Hard Rock at noon. SPREAD THE VIRUS, Opie

      The Dallas Cowboys have released Quincy Carter because he had failed a drug test. So the Cowboys QB will either be Vinny Testaverdie or Chad Huchsington [i know i can't spell for shit, Boston Public Schools for you]
