      So i just got a blog, not sure why but ohwell.  Today was good. Woke up VERY late as usual. My friend Tuesday that's staying here is really getting on my nerves. I'm sure I'm getting on hers as well. Joz called and wanted to go to the beach, but it was raining to we decided to just go to her house. I called Katey and her, Tuesday, and I all went to Joz's. There we met Bill and Tal. We all watched Donnie Darko. Yes I'm getting sick of that movie. I know it's hard to believe because it's like the best movie, but this was like my 8th time watching it. Ohwell, it was good the first three times. So then we all went to Taco Bell and ate. Then Tuesday and I went to Kateys house while Tal Joz and Bill went to the beach. We were just being silly at her house and took pictures pretending to play basketball.. yeah wtf? I don't know.. I downloaded that "sail away sail away" song by Enya and we were blasting that for a while. Ha Joz saw our away message last night about Van Morrison and she had downloaded "Brown- eyed Girl" Ha, that was funny. Last night on AIM, Kevin saw my crazy Van Morrison away message too and said he liked that song too. I can't wait to see him. It's so wierd like I don't like him that way at all but he likes me, and like noone likes me. Kevin's adorable too, so I don't know whats wrong with me. I'm too busy liking wierd people like Mike Singer and Milt. Hm. I really should move on with my life.  But anyways then Bill picked us all up and we went to Jocylyns Youth group thing. I could tell Katey and Tuesday were really bored. They kept looking at me lik "ok when can we leave". Yeah I guess it was pretty boring. Rhonda was there and she hates me I think so that was wierd. I met Jocylyns friend Melody, and shes really nice. I was lisstening to the sermon and the songs, but I didn't really feel God's presence. I really wanna be closer to God. Like I think I'm already pretty close. First of all I believe in him and I have faith in him. I pray every night for my family, friends, and for myself. But I guess theres more I could do. I don't know. So many of my friends don't even believe in God, and those who don't really like follow him you know? Like Natalie is the only one. Liek I don't know I think I'm just more private about my faith. I don't really like going to church that much because worshipping with other people just feels wierd to me. I hope that doesn't make me a bad person.. I don't know.  Another thing is I really care too much what people think. Most people hate me or whatever so that makes things worse. I know I'm hard to get along with sometimes, but a lot of people that don't even know me judge me. That's really not fair. Like this year has been the worst year of my life. People have just betrayed me in so many ways, and I just don't depend on anyone anymore. last night Mike told me that everyone at Allderdice thinks I'm a joke. I don't think that's true. People liek him just liek to bring others down, and that's just not cool. I need to stop living in the past though. I need to figure out who I am and just not care what others think. I need to find me and be comfortable as me. I just know I can't live another year like I lived this year. Ohwell. I think we're about to go pick up my Grandma at the airport. I hear becky comming up the stairs...
