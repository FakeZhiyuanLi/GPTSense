      My mother is the epitimy of evil. She is the stupidest, most horrendus human to walk the earth. I cant have a friend over today, and the reason? Hmmm...oh yeah! There ISNT ONE! You know, I really hate people who get along with their parents. They need to burn.  Blowing off some steam, so laters.  Angry yells and whips, RavingBITCH

      Hello again. Its me. NO, its YOUR MOTHER. No its me. Oh shut up, what do you know, I'm sitting in my fluffy pink robe that says "Princess" from 6th grade and I am NOT A HAPPY CAMPER. SO FUCK YOU. I mean, er, sorry Mr. Post Administrator, I dont USUALLY swear...  Anyways! So school is starting in like a week, and I havent gone shopping yet. Its cuz my friend over here (See the mini blonde one? Yep, thats her!) has been SO BLOODY SLOW that she still hasnt gone shopping with me!  Well, this year is totally gonna rock. I mean, I've changed so much over the summer, I got my hair cut cropped really short to my chin, then it grew to my neck, so I'm getting it cut again. And I got slightly tanner, but thats not really it. I've really started taking a huge shine to singers/songwriters Tori Amos and Ani Difranco, and they're painful, witty lyrics have rocked. I'm not goth anymore, just funky. And ever since I got a pretty big part in the camp play, I feel really refreshed - its good to know  someone  thinks  I'm talented! Also, I have my two bestest friends to make my probably-last-year with them frocking brilliant! A+N, My fave girliepals, this year is gonna rock! And I got taller. No, I do not know how its possible...I am now 5'6 and a half, ladies and gents! Whoo-hoo! I'm officially six inches taller than Anna! Yaaaaay!  But I'm also really mad, cuz at camp, I developed a crush on the most perfect guy possible. He's amazingly talented, has the coolest hair (even though its brown) and is like 5'9 or whatever, just taller than me, which is like the perfect height ! *sighs* but now he's gone...  Anyway, I've made a vow to my friends that I'm going to be totally boy free the first month of school, its a little bet we have going. Anyway, since this is almost impossible for me, who has a crush on about 10 different people (Orlando WILL be mine, you snickering infidels...) it should be pretty damn interesting. I dont want to date anyone this year, I've decided, because my boyfriends experiences (I've had four) have never been...well...great. And the guys at my school?   *eerie silence*   Moving on, I gotta skedadle! Brekkie time, so leave me your comments and I'll eat them.  x's n o's, RavingBitch

       Hello earthlings! Its your GOD! No no, its not a bird or a plane or even a very attractive bimbo...no! Its your loud-mouthed pal from one of the world's whitest, bitchiest towns! Okay, so now that you're here, this is the standard warning...        I tend to be very upfront about issues I care about, so dont you even try to mess with me, I'll squash you like a bug. Just ask Anna or Neelima, lol guys!    Swearing. If your a devout christian, you may as well leave because you're pretty much going to find everything on my blog offensive...tata real smooth!    Actually, if you're a devout christian, I already dont like you.     Ok, well thats it, so, until five from now...         Kisses,    RavingBitch
