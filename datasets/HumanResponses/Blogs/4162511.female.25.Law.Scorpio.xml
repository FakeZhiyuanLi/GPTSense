       CISV-kids&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink       Children's International Summer Villages (CISV) is a unique youth exchange organization CISV evolved from a firm conviction that lasting peace is possible if individuals and groups can learn to live together as friends. For CISV, the key to making this vision a reality, was to start working with children and youth. Programmes were developed which offered young people opportunities to meet their peers from other countries and to form intercultural friendships. Locally, programmes give people the chance to learn about the cultures in their own communities and explore important themes related to peace and understanding.

       Naisa and I  urlLink    Darl and Sev (with the star of the night...THE DREADED COLLEGE LOGBOOK)  urlLink    Naisa, myself, and darl =)  urlLink    (Pics courtesy of Kench Genato...thanks man!)     I actually woke up today thinking it was already sunday. I was looking for the sunday papers but unsuccessfully (obviously) failed to find them. So i convinced myself that yes, it is saturday. I think this is due to the fact that I had a blast last night! I was out with friends from highschool and college, after our first get-together two weeks ago! It's surprising how easily they can be invited to spur of the moment gimmicks...And of course, we brought the college 'logbook' to the gimmik.  First of all, I was at work the whole day. The day was gloomy so wasn't really in the mood to start with a pleading. It was supposed to be the day of the deadline for the draft Answer but learned that we were filing an extension. Thank god! Intellectual Property Law is interesting. And, I am determined to make this case my test case. We have a pretty good case. We are the defendants, as usual. But on the merits, there is really no infringement. Really. Ok, I'll stop talking about work now.  After work, julie and I planned to go to the gym (Fort) before heading over to Cena at Greenbelt, a bar cum restaurant owned by college friends. Julie felt sick though, so she went home and promised to drop by for the gimmick. I drove to the fort and got a text from Andrew. He, along with jazzy and jax c. were having wine. I knew I was easily bought. hahah....red wine being the bait, and good conversation an additional plus.  I finally arrived at the Fort after being stuck in friday traffic for almost 30 mins...(from Buendia!). I proceeded to meet andrew, jaz, and jax at Pasto. Had yummy cheap table red wine which cost a mere 250 bucks. (i think) After a nice conversation about work again (the four of us are lawyers), and the upcoming Bar exams next month, and a few more random ramblings, my phone was going wild with calls asking me where I was na. Note. Meeting time at greenbelt was 9pm. Jackie at 9 pm: Having a nice drink and a nice conversation at the Fort. Panic mode. Note that I was the one who had the table reserved at Cena, under my name, for 10 pax, smoking section. Plus, I had to take a shower and change. At this point, I knew that I was going to the gym not for anything but to shower.  I went to the gym at 930. Good thing I didnt smell like cigarette smoke (which I hate!), didnt need to take a shower. I changed, washed up, and applied my kikay stuff. (yes, i have that side, fyi).  RUSHED to greenbelt after. Got a parking slot right away lucky me, then suddenly got a call from Darl, telling me she was lost in the middle of greenbelt, standing infront of Seabest near the fountain area. Here I go coming to the rescue, logbook and Commercial Law Book in hand, then finally, proceeded to Cena.  Sev, Nelson, Naisa, Kench (yes, 'Catsup') were there already. In the next table were my Utopian law school batchmates. Behind us were ana p, kris, and mannix (a.k.a. 'louie heredia') haha. Mini reunion. Ken, Den, and Jerome were surprisingly indoors upstairs! Pancho, Al, and Neil Galang were there too. Blast from the past people, from the "next door" bench during college.  Started the night with my favorite, Cena's frozen ginpom...thanks to my waiter, Roman, who never fails to give the best damn service! Naisa then ordered pepperoni pizza...I dont eat meat. But this night was an exception. Pizza was ok, though I'm not really a pizza person. After the ginpom, and a few hours later, Julie arrived. Ordered Julie's favorite, Frozen dalandan margarita! Another YUM! Ken dropped by, and had a beer with him. Naisa at this point was giving me "the eye", and then intentionally spilled her beer on the floor. hehehe...love ya nais! Naisa wanted to dance, so I acceded. Went to temple with her, ken, and julie. stayed for about 15 mins. Fun, but couldnt stand the heat and the smell of (lust?)!!! auughh. I think I'm getting old...(For my contemporaries, if you wanna feel instantly old, go to Temple). At this point, it was already almost 3am. Brought naisa home, and gave me a 20 min lecture. hehehe...trust me nais. FUN FUN NIGHT! DP is in HongKong with family...left friday the 6th staying til the 8th! Miss ya...mwahhh....this night couldve been more fun with you around. ;)  Pics to follow soon....kench kench kench!! gimme pics!

           You're chocolate. You're the old soul type, people feel that they have known you their entire life. Many often open up to you for they view you as thoughtful and trustworthy. Although people trust you, you have a hard time trusting them. You prefer to keep your feelings bottled up inside, or display them very quietly. It is alright to open up every once in a while.   urlLink  Which kind of candy are you?    brought to you by   urlLink

       Benefit's Pineapple Facial Polish.....soo yummy.  The scent is great, you'd never want to get out of the shower.  Be careful though, of those tiny pineapple beads getting stuck in your nose. HAHA!                                     urlLink

        I AM SOO SLEEPY........     Total hours slept (three nights): 9 hours!!!!!!!!! Call it suicide, but thanks to coffee, and a mental image of my nephew, I surprisingly manage to get through my day: preparing a pleading, driving, a trip to the fiscal's office, a trip to ACCRA, conducting direct examinaton, rebutting an objection...all included.

          Found this pic...just couldn't resist posting it. =) adorable.......     (in case you didn't notice....that's a real pup..teehee)     Speaking of dogs (again...) I recently found out that my lab -- Sushi, gave birth(again...) to my DALMATIAN's -- Bogart's puppies (again...) Arrghhh......... somehow, Sushi and Duke (my male lab) arent really sexually "in sync", although there has been one successful hit in the past, producing around 10 pups! Sushi for this latest batch gave birth to three puppies..and for those of you who are curious as to how the puppies look, well, theyre black, but with polka-dot boots...seriously. Due to the rarity of this occasion, ladies and gentlemen...I hereby present to you, the latest breed....
