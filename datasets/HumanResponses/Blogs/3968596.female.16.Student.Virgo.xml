      ARRGHHH!!!! I can't take it ! My mom is driving me crazy. It's so frustrating. She nags and nags and nags and nags.... I was cleaning with that decrepit vacuum of hers&nbsp;when it fell over and the on/off switch broke. Now, it won't turn off when it's plugged in. I already said sorry but no she won't have it.&nbsp;She's still nagging at me now.&nbsp;I'm in&nbsp;another room with headphones blasting&nbsp;away music in an attempt to drown her out. It's difficult.&nbsp;I can still hear her asking me things; I have to answer at least some of the questions (or else she'll barge in here). &nbsp;   Is it really necessary for parents to drive their own flesh and blood up the walls? It must be their mission. Is she trying to push me away by causing all this stress? Stress. That's the big word. Lately, she been more I don't know. Very moody? She's always hyper in tense situations. She needs to breathe. Deeply. But will she listen? Oh, no...she just  has  to cause chaos by acting hysterical and then passing the mood to everyone else around her. Yeah, good job.   I need space. It's way I'm here typing with my headphones- I can't handle the frustration that comes with her presence every time she argues.   ::sigh:: I recently received an invitation from the National Society of High School Scholars and two more college aid letters. I have to pay a fee for NSHSS membership and a processing fee for one of the college aid submissions. Oh yeah, in addition, there's my senior portraits left to pay for. The college process and, especially, public education aren't cheap.   I'm excited for my last year of high school and apprehensive of applying for college, though. I have to retake the SAT I and SATIIs; my scores were average and I was eligible for aid with them but...colleges are so competitive now. I really need a better score.   I feel much calmer now. I'm not really that mad at her any more. I know she cares...but still does she have yell so shrilly? Writing is becoming more of a necessity to me nowadays. Also, it's much easier to vent to a journal than my mother. Safer too- less headache.

         I'm trying to start up a website but I tell you it's not easy. Especially for moi who is sometimes technologically challenged. There are so many html tags! It's insane. My friend Mel is a wiz at html but I want to do this on my own...you know actually learn something during my summer break. I do have homework for AP English...but I'm avoiding it...for now at least. How fun is analyzing? Higher education has really sucked the fun outta reading.       Anywayz, my website isn't doing  too  badly. I mean it still needs major work but I'm thinking of new things to put on it. Maybe links to random fun stuff on the web. I already have a page filled with some of my favorite quizzes:     urlLink  http://www.geocities.com/moonlightenshi/quizpg.html      My friend Arvon sent me an im from the Phillippines, who when I asked which part of the Phillippines--he didn't know. Well that's nice. A  t least it's never a boring conversation with him. He has a strange liking to pain and suffering...I told him to keep his fantasies to himself. (pffft, like he'd listen).     Here's snippets of the IM:    ------------------------------     moonlightenshi87 (1:30:27 AM): NO don't do it    SinOfHearts (1:30:42 AM): what's that? u do!?wow i didn't know    moonlightenshi87 (1:31:12 AM): ::sigh:: now ur deaf too    SinOfHearts (1:31:21 AM): lol jk ...seriously, i can be perverted. wanna see!?    moonlightenshi87 (1:33:07 AM): no not really    SinOfHearts (1:33:17 AM): lol what!? U DO!!!!????    moonlightenshi87 (1:33:37 AM): dear god for all that is holy and sacred don't do it    SinOfHearts (1:34:24 AM): lol cuz u know i can huh?    moonlightenshi87 (1:34:39 AM): probably, doesn't mean ya should    SinOfHearts (1:34:54 AM): lol    ------------------------------    moonlightenshi87 (12:37:49 AM): i'm just sorry that i can't smack you. are u happy now? u've finally provoke me enough to want to inflict injury on u.    SinOfHearts (12:38:37 AM): lol yeah     ------------------------------    SinOfHearts (1:00:11 AM): damn...run me over!!!!    moonlightenshi87 (1:00:22 AM): lol, don't wish it!    SinOfHearts (1:00:37 AM): lol y not? then i can sue u and take all ur caaash!    moonlightenshi87 (1:01:26 AM): b/c it might happen, i doubt it will but do u really want to be squished under the tires of my car? it'll put u in a lot of pain and probably ICU    SinOfHearts (1:02:20 AM): lol, i'm curious but hey i can. i dun want it to happen either but if it does, i can know how it feels    ------------------------------      Well he's just hopeless -_-6     Anywayz, I'm needed to polish furniture...au revoir.

       Hello minna! This my first time as a blogger, so I'm a litle nervous about how to do things but i think this will be a fun experience. For right now...well i'm sleepy. I'll grace you with me presence later. lol.&nbsp;I bid you adieu.

      I washed my first car today. But it wasn't that bad. Well, I only did part of the car because my dad just wanted me to get the feel of it. I actually got into it, if you could believe that. I guess it's because I'm a detailed oriented person. I believe I really could turn into one of those people who  become obsess with the appearance of their car. My friend Kristine is one of them. She used to wax her car so much that the top was so smooth and slick that it was impossible to sit on. But she's a little less intense now. Well I have that UC essay...still...due this Monday...I should go....

       I woke up around noonish...again. I really need to sleep earlier. But anywayz, I walked downstairs into the kitchen because I was told that my friend Kristine had called. As soon as my mom saw me she asked for my help. She needed help to order her name badge and business cards for her new career as a realtor because she's absolutely clueless when it comes to the internet and anything else computer-related.  I tried  to be patience. I  honestly  did. But that's hard to do when I wake up late so I still a little achy, I haven't had anything to eat, and she keeps questioning me on wheather  I'm  doing the right thing. So I got snappy. End resullt: I'm responsible for her now snappy mood. ::sigh:: That's life.      I really  can  be patient and understanding but  not  after I wake up or if I have an empty stomach. And it's even worse if I'm related to the person I'm being crabby at because I won't feel much, if any, qualms about lashing out first before assessing the situation.       She told me that she doesn't snap at me when I ask for help. But oh is she wrong! She does it when she's very frustrated. She compare my behavior to my dad's, which I find insulting. She says that she didn't learn anything because I was too fast. Hmmm...well if she had  said  something oh I dunno...maybe I would have stopped. She also said she asked me at that moment for help because she didn't want to bother me later---when I'll probably be more content because my morning crankiness is gone?? If I had said later, she would have called me selfish and lazy, which is what she called me after this little episode anyway! Well, now she's out running errands. I've calmed down---I've had bowl of moose tracks ice cream, chocolate does do the mind good. Hopefully, she'll be calmer when she gets back. She won't drop what she said but what else can I expect? ::sigh::

      ha! I actually did great at my piano lesson today. She still made me cringe though---what with her tendency to be anal about  everything ---but it was okay.&nbsp;No death glares for me today!&nbsp;&nbsp;I also saw Jackie, a&nbsp;journalism buddy (who btw also agrees that my teacher is anal, it appears she's seen it first-hand as an observer while waiting for guitar lessons), at Sounds of Music.   It's a freaky coincidence that I've also her seen a couple weeks ago at the mall. It's weird how I keep bumping into people from school. I'm not really used to it.&nbsp;It doesn't seem&nbsp;like a big deal to most but I'm what you'd call...a social hermit during the summer time&nbsp;or any vacation time. Why?&nbsp;Well, I can't drive myself---yet, and&nbsp;I like my solitude.      Think of it this way: I'm not anti-social,

       Thursday= 1 hour torture @ hands of old lady trying to teach me piano. She gives me these looks of disapproval. A LOT. They seem like glares. It's makes feel all guilty....just because I don't practice for hours or as much as she'd like me too. Actually, it's more like I forget too...I honestly do! But I can learn pieces pretty quick though. Well I have till 3:45 when the lesson starts. I have a piece down for my recital down---"The Bohemian Dance" by something or other. It's quite nice. Have I mentioned that the recital's in  November ??  Earlier, Ryan lost his piano books---the same one one that coincidently have the duet pages in 'em. Well...yeah I kind of need those. Thank god, we found the music books! He says doesn't like piano or doing duets. I don't really care. He's a living hypocrit and pessimist, who tries to make everyone around him miserable. His lessons take longer b/c his teacher makes him stay in to practice more I guess.  Because Ryan hardly EVER practices. He's irritated that most of his lesson is devoted to learning the duet part instead of his book---well, if he  did  practice his lessons maybe they would move on to something else. Well my brother's a dumbass but that's common knowledge. He once pursuaded my mom to buy a huge pack of STYROFOAM plates because he thought they were better than paper. Yeah....styrofoam is deadly for the ozone layer. I had refused to use those plates and my mom purchase paper ones afterwards. She has even told me once that she would have gladly given him up for adoption if she'd known about the way he was going to turn out. He seriously needs a psychiatrist for a reality check.  Maybe some retilin too. -_-  ::sigh:: The piano beckons me. I must answer it. Or watch as my mother's money goes down the drain.

      I'm currently writing up my UC essay assignment for AP English. The first two questions about academics and potential to contribute were very easy! But the third question is a toughie. It's why I'm out blogging instead of answering. It's an open-ended question. Sounds easy but no; I'm suffering from writer's block.  This is the part on the UC application where I put down anything that I think the universities should know about me. My friend Robert advises me to put a sad, sob story---if I have one. It's pathetic but true. Colleges really lap up heartbreak. It's too bad I've been mostly spoiled throughout my life. Damn. I can totally write a fictionally sob story but then (knwing my luck) I'll probably get caught. Then no other college will even think of perusing my application. Cheaters only cheat themselves. So I'm told.  I still think Mrs. Cutler (the AP English 12 teacher) is an evil slave driver. (I thought the same for Ms. Burrows--my 7th grade teacher, but I dubbed her a minion from hell.) I know this is AP, but  come on ! I have a life too. Well it's like this. In addition to finishing the UC essay (which I guess I appreciate, lord knows I would have procrastinated in November), I have to do an annotated bibliography for 25 essays out of the Fields of Writing (someone should burn those those fields) and another annotated bibliography for 20 "My Turn" essays out of Newsweek. Hmmm....I don't know about anybody else but that a LOT of analyzing! Oh the slave driver also wants the UC essay due Monday, Aug. 2nd, I have less than a week left. Oh joy.  Earlier, I sent an IM to my "friend" Jessica. I used quotations because as of late I don't considered her a true friend b/c sometimes she is, sometimes she isn't. We're in a lot of classes and clubs together so I see her a lot. She's friendly when she needs me but when it's the other way around it's all ---> "oh, sorry, I'm busy...I have music...I have this...I have a test...I have mono..." Well okay I made the last one up but she's really is like that! It's only academics (and the flute---out of all the instruments to choose...the flute...) with that girl. Another thing is that I would be talking to someone in class and she butts right into the conversation. All of the sudden I'm out of the conversation because she has steered it to something I either really don't care about or have no clue about. Or we're in a club meeting and she hardly acknowledges that I'm there. Well, that's  some friend . Honestly, that why I hardly study with her. Also, it's not as if she needs me there anyway; she can handle it herself---she is uber brainy.  Anywayz, I need to get back to the essay if I want to meet deadline. Bientot!

       My family went out to this chinese buffet for dinner tonight. The exciting part is that I got to drive there (in a separate car from my siblings and with my dad to supervise, of course). It was going good and I even parked correctly this time! lol. Not something that's frequent with me.  However, after dinner...I swear my dad showed signs of PMS. What's his problem? Kept screeching about take turn now, no this turn!! Well, if I could concentrate maybe, just maybe, I could pay more attention to the light. Wouldn't that be much better? Not to mention, safer? I should just ignore him completely and only pick up when he's talking about turning. There. Well, it's seems childish--but that's how he's acting too.  Then, we came home after stopping for a few groceries from VONS (which btw he didn't help me upload or put them away--the selfish...). Oh, I bought a few magazines and some gum to add to the cart at the store in vengence. Do I need to know what the lastest trends for fall are? Maybe. Or what celebrity is dating who? Hell, no. But will it make my dad spend more money than he has to? Of course. (It's not as if I don't like teen magazines because I do read them but I can live without them.)  My brother Ryan, who's as irritable as hell, comments "Oh, you have no taste in food....oh, why did you choose that?" My response: where you there--NO, did you bring the food in--NO, then stuff yourself. That and I didn't tell him where the ice cream was or that we even bought it, well, Mr. Think-He-Knows-All can find it on his own.  Why is my family so damn moody?? Later, at home I found my siblings fighting over a ball. A stupid rubber ball. Of course, that triggered my mom. And well...the rest is chaos. Now, I'm not going to say that they're dysfunctional because they aren't but they freak out at the littlest things  way  too much.  On the plus side, I think I'm ready for my behind the wheel test. My permit expires on Aug. 14th and my test is on Aug. 10th. Think that's cutting it too close? It is! I can't believe it. One chance to make or I start all over again. I'll do fine if I'm not nervous though. And as long as neither of my parents are in the car with me (and they won't, yes!).

       Oh, I have? Well it's true! I got an early birthday present!! And what a great present it was...a personal laptop! I was just visiting my grandparents in Torrance and they suprise me with it (my b-day isn't until Sept. 17th). Now, I know nothing about installing programs, except that you keep clicking "yes," "next," and finally "finish." It's horrible! But, hey at least I'm not completely clueless concerning computer stuff...I know how to blog, right??

      After my hair was done (b/c I'm hopeless when left by myself), I went straight to the Lifetouch studio for my senior photos. I got the Silver pkg (which included two outfits along w/ the yearbook shots) and the cap and gown option. Now, I'm usually terrified of taking yearbook pictures...for me, at least, I always hate my pictures no matter what anyone tells me. In freshman and sophmore year, my hair was curled and lil too poufy---it looked like I had afro. Seriously. I hated it. In junior year, it was mostly straight but wavy---not so bad but I thought I looked way too happy in the picture. ::sigh::  Anywayz, the studio was so cool! Lots of fun backdrops. And it went by quick too...and painless. Fun, too. I recognized a bunch of people from school there. I was suprised that I wasn't nervous a lot---actually it would have been a challenge b/c the photographers were so friendly. Probably b/c they're pros, who knew exactly what they were doing---not like the bumbling fools hired at regular school photo shoots for the year, where the flash is blinding and the risk of blinking on film is high.  Well, I hoped these pics turn out good...I won't know till two weeks. Which reminds me that I need to pick up the stuff Kristine and I painted plus I need to do my b-t-w test...

       I'm only 16!I can't be losing my hair! That's for  really  old people! My hair stylist, Rozban, said so and tells me that it's probably due to stress. She informed me (and my mom) that stress can be caused by a wide range of troubles---academics, parents arguing, etc. Ha! I knew it! My family does give me stress. But I still want to keep my hair!! So, I'm suppose to use my mom's special shampoo b/c it's ph balanced w/ other good hair-care qualities. I always thought losing a little hair was normal (avg person loses 40 strands a day) but I guess in my case it's not a little but enough to start thinning my hair! WHY ME??!! Well, my session went nicely after that lil shocker. I had it cut to long layers so it's still mid-back. I luv that length! When I was little, I had long, straight hair but an unfortunate hair cut accident w/ my dad in the 3rd grade left me w/ hair chopped right below my ears!  Anywayz, Rozban styled my hair quite nicely afterwards (I was going to take my senior pics later). Shiny and sleek with bouncy curls at the ends. Best haircut ever! Made me forget about the whole "hair " thing. Besides if I use that shampoo, my hair should stop doing  that  and return to a healthy state in 3 weeks. She's also giving me a deal on this hair serum from Avaeda that keeps hair shiny and soft. It really does pay to have connections w/ a hair stylist. ^_^

       Life's full of lovely random suprises. Kristine picked me up @ 10 a.m. and we went to TVHS to turn in our UC essays to Ms. Cutler. Well, we go there and Ms.Culter replies---"You didn't double-space?" At that point, I think my face blanched. I swear (and I doubled checked) that this lil bit of info was NOT in the instructions. So Kris and I rushed to my house, where we promptly had to retype her essay and print mine out with the correct spacing. When she was done typing it was 15 minutes to 11 a.m., our deadline. As I was finishing my corrections, I told her to warm up the car. It felt like we were doing a heist. lol. I then rushed out of my house like a mad woman into her car that was ready to go and we sped off (hmmm... I wonder how fast we were driving?). Kris pulled up to the front office and I  ran  out of the car to deliver the essay on time (last I checked we still had 5 minutes at the stoplight). lol I didn't even shut the car door. What an adventure! We're always doing crazy things like that. lol.  Anywayz, afterwards we treated ourselves to some Ben and Jerry's, which is surprisingly cheaper than B&amp;R. We were in the Town Plaza, so Kristine wanted to look at the pottery store, Painted Earth. We ended up staying there for about 3 1/2 hrs painting little star shaped ceremic boxes---she had also decided to do a ceramic car for her boyfriend. It was a ton of fun and way relaxing. teehee I got to get in touch w/ my creative, artsy side!

Anica , this is the little 3 yr old terror herself.       Pej trying to be an alcoholic ...lol actually it's just a too-gross-for-words energy drink. But we're saying it's beer, lol.       Maji's Cake --ube flavored, wasn't so bad until I discover the icing turned lips blue.      Here's  Kevin w/ Anica and Jordan the poodle ---poor pooch got dragged around A LOT. That's animal abuse ::sigh:: when will those crazy kids learn... -_-       Valerie  actually turned green. She got sick from the car ride over. It was funny. I never thought you could actually turn that color.      It's a  rose and cute lolly!  I picked it up from one of the vases as a souvenir. Nabbed the last one too.

       OMG, I nearly smacked the hell of my printer this morning. I finally got computer paper last night and the stupid thing wouldn't work. Now, I tried  very  hard to restrain myself since the essay was due in three hours. I'm required to turn it in to Ms. Cutler at the front office...why she can't wait until school starts I dunno. Anywayz, I freaked out! B/c no matter what I did the printer was set in photo mode. I was thinking of these possibilities of how exactly I could get it printed---go to the library, Mailbox Etc., waking up neighbors at this ungodly hour (at least it is when it's still summer break)... Then I restarted the computer and the printer miraculously started working... ^_^6  Silly me, that always works.

      I went to Maji's 1st b-day today. The first thing she did when I saw her was cry. I didn't think she liked me that much...(and who wants to be known as making babies cry??) but she actually warmed up to me later. I also saw a bunch of other aunts, uncles, and cousins. But I was mobbed by my grandma (from my dad's side) who then proceed to grope my ass while hugging me. I've noticed that my other grandma, and occassionally my mom, do that sometimes.  What is with the butt thing?  Leave me alone!! ::sigh:: It was still great to see them all again.       How kawaii!  It's s/t my aunt gave me from the cake.   I saw another lil cousin, Anica (she's 3 yrs old), which is always amusing since she's used to having her way and does that most hilarious things. She started to strip her clothes off because she had wanted to swim but Sophie (another baby cousin) had her suit. LOL. Geez, she's bold. Then again, I guess all three-yrs-olds are typically carefree.       Here's the b-day girl!  Eating my kitty...no!! Well, maybe she's attracted to the frosting still on it...

I began wrapping it up Saturday night and, well, I couldn't go to sleep until it was gone and done with. Wow...1000 words. It suxs that I have absolutely no computer paper in the house now that I realized it...NO! Oh well, I'll have to haggle my dad into buying some tommorow, ummm well today (I really shouldn't work into the early hours of the morning it makes al spacey). Anywayz, I need some much needed rest. i wil celebrate the completion of part  one of my summer english assignment with some peanut butter cap'n crunch tommorow. today. whenever the hell I wake up.

       I went downstairs to get a snack and to quench my parched throat. What I witness was my mom and siblings camping out in the family room watching a movie w/out me. How rude! Well, not really, I kind of forgot that she was going to rent a movie. She got "The In-Laws," which I has a few funny parts so far. Anywayz, right now, I eating Ritz crackers w/ cream cheese, a side of peanut butter, and some apple-grape juice (mmm...yummy).

      I ventured to Lake Elsinore today with my family to go the Outlet- a little shopping center placed in the middle of practically nowhere. I usually despise going there b/c not only is it very hot during the summer but it's usually barren and lifeless with zombie-like shoppers and rude salespeople (at least at their Billabong store). Great place...but today was a little different, we found a lil cafe called Aruba that was hidden in a corner. It was nice, small business, nicely decorated in a tropical, friendly theme. Nice sandwiches too (lol I need another adjective). And much better than Dairy Queen, which is the only other food place in the there. I've decided to postpone my permit test till Monday morning b/c I forgot to study for it...I didn't want to cram either. Hell, I even forgot it was Thursday. I only remembered when Ryan told me about our piano lessons today and I had checked my cell to make sure. ::sigh:: I was behind a day in my head...how hopeless is that? School starts in around two weeks...maybe then I'll regain my consciousness of time.

       I went shopping for clothes today in lieu of going crazy over my summer assignment. I was in the magic land of pants, tops, and accessories. And I loved every minute. I fought back fatigue to the bitter end---actually when I'm shopping I just go into this unstoppable, energetic mode. I went to Tilly's and went a lil crazy but I found pants that fit! That's one of the greatest joys in life. It's unusual but for me, who is very petite, it's absolutely true. So, I bought 4 pairs along with two shirts (one of them is green Hurley tee, I don't usually wear that color but it was too cute to resist) and a belt. I got another pair of flip-flops too...my mom says that I must have ten pairs already...but if they weren't so comfortable...  I volunteered to help Valerie search for clothes for school (in record time might I add, the girl typically takes  forever  by herself) and found a pair of shoes that Kevin liked. Ha! I was on a roll! Such a productive day. Plus all this fun has now completely erased the depressing vibes from yesterday.  I love that good feeling and positive energy that comes with shopping. It's my remedy. There's a commercial about " the healing power of cotton ." It's true. It works. ^_^

       Well, I failed my b-t-w driving test this morning. Yeah...I went into a shock at first. I didn't really think about it. But then I went throught this whole "self-hating->angry->depressing->perky, oh well it happened " phase afterwards. I kind of feel sorry for the poor soul that was with me (my mom). I lost the attitude when we went over to Office Depot to return s/t. A cute sales guy helps us out...hard to stay mad after that. I swear my mom has the ability to read minds. Because I was thinking of Baskins Robins and as we got out to the parking lot she said "don't worry, I treat you to some ice cream." Weird. So, I drowned out any depressing thoughts w/ a nice wafflecone of cherry jubilee that the lady literally doused w/ whipped cream and almonds (::it was too much but mmm...it was yum::).  Anywayz, I started looking at the plus side to this "failed" test with an optimistic light. My consolation was that this test was  way  better than the practice test I took with John the driver instructor. That practice test went......badly, to put it in simpler terms. I mean this time, on the  real  test, I didn't make  any  dangerous manuevers or go in the opposite lane. I think that's a LOT of improvement. I still made a critical error today though. I made a nice right turn...but didn't stop at the RED light before doing it. Oops. And he intervened by telling me "stop." I was decelarating and going to stop! sheesh.   I mean it's not like I hit anything or maimed a pedestrian.    But I'm over it. Better luck next time I guess. I'm re-taking my permit exam this Fri. b/c it expires on Thurs. The receptionist showed disapprovement at my situation but oh well. She should happy that the roads are still considered safe and she doesn't have to fear for her life. Well, yet anywayz...

      I'm not even close to finishing up my summer assignments...I'm  suppose  to be reading 1984 right now...but instead it's on the desk, glaring accusingly at me under the superficial light of my lamp (the cover is plain white w/ a huge blue eyeball, yeah...kinda weird). Is it so bad that I got distracted with my laptop...

       Well, today the DMV wasn't closed, it just didn't open till 8:30 a.m. instead of its regular 7:30. Why? That's thanks to the "Saturday session" this week. I had to waited for over an hour in line. Not funny to me. I felt drained when the doors finally opened. Ya know the price for a permit doubles (???) when you have to redo it. ::sigh:: But, as I was in the lil testing room, there was a nervous 1st timer on my left and a confused immigrant on my right. I just sat all calm and checking off answers w/ confidence. However, there were a bit annoying. They seriously needed to relax. And to stop that tapping and frustrating sighing. Plus, never forget how the DMV doesn't care whether you have peace while taking the test. Annoucements were as loud as ever and the people outside of the room didn't have the decency to keep it down. Good thing I used to working under distractions.  Fortunately, I passed the written exam again. 100% this time (the lady turned the 100 into a smiley face). I had three errors the last time and now that I think of it, they were dumb questions to miss. But, oh well...c'est la vie. Now about that behind-the-wheel test...

      LOL. My brother came home with his head shaven!!! LOL. He looked pretty pissed. My mom said he didn't wanted a regular boy's cut so he opted for "whatever" as he puts it. So now he's mad, yet again, at the world and everyone else around him. He really doesn't have a right to be...he did ask for that cut by himself. Plus it's not like he has a lumpy head...just big ears.

       I just got interviewed by a Press-Enterprise reporter!!! I was kind of nervous at first but it went fine. She asked me questions about what I thought of the college admissions process and what i was doing to prepare for it. And she said she would ask her editors if it would be okay to photograph me for the article!!!! I started jumping around my room, shouting out exclaimations of excitement (when we hung up of course---I didn't want her to think I was crazy or anything...)  The reason why she called me was because I participated in the 2004 P-E Journalism Boot Camp. They didn't make us run laps or do push-ups. It was a work shop that taught teens, who were interested in journalism, about the whole business, how to get in it, how to interview, ways to improve our writing, etc. For a week I came to the Press-Enterprise office and stayed from 9 a.m. till 5 p.m. to be around professional journalists and learn from them. There were also GREAT luncheons. And they gave us bootcampers porfolios with notepads for interviewing, an AP style manual, and other goodies.  So when Kim (the reporter) e-mailed for a list of names that she could use as sources for her article, I casually slipped in that I too was going to be a senior going off to college next year...which just proves that you should never waste an opportunity!!!

      Today I registered for my senior year. Before I went, however, I was hoping to get my permit test renewal over and done with. Well, my mom and I went early but I noticed that after a while the cars in the parking lot kept leaving. And as opening time approached, there was no long line that extended the side of the DMV complex. Huh...then I looked down at the papers I printed and I discovered that the DMV didn't open on the Mondays before their Saturday sessions -_-  Anywayz, we just left for the school afterwards. The guy who took my id picture was stupid or just very inattentive. Couldn't tell really. It wasn't a bad picture, just that you can see a large gap between the top of my head and the top of the pic that's blue, courtesy of the background. I look short. Then  another  picture for the school's filing system. This guy was cute. And nice. Not at all like that previous dummy for brains. But he took the photo right when I decided to take my gum out... *^^* Oops. I asked for a retake and told him that I promised I wouldn't do it again. He just smiled and laughed but he did take my retake. Why can't guys in my school be like that nice photographer...  Then I placed a deposit on a nice, sparkly class ring.Grabbed my schedule, got my books, and waiting in a line to pay for my yearbook, asb sticker, and grad nite. Not cheap, quite pricy for $130. AND I had all five of my books w/ me in the line...my arms were shaky after I put them down in the car. (yeah...no upper body strength, not much anywayz). I  was  standing in that line for probably around 10 minutes or so. Afterwards, I finally turned in my BR application. And got a cookies-N-cream shake. ^_^

       Well, I'm typing away with my laptop when my dad comments that my cousin Pej has a laptop, too---  Him: "But, he saved money to get it." Me: "You're point being..." Him: "I think you know my point." (leaves)  So....is this suppose to be a guilt trip? I  can  earn things. I've earned the top grades in my class and numerous acheivement awards. And honor roll, too! And I'm working my way towards a job...still. But it's hard, when you have AP classes and extracurricular obligations.  Furthermore, mine was a  gift ---a  birthday  present to be exact. I didn't ask for it, it was unplanned, it was a  suprise . Besides, Pej's grandparents from his dad side could SO buy him a laptop---they're pretty well off, so I've heard. My friend once asked if I would have been better off with money for college as a gift......a great idea.......then I could spend it on "textbooks."
