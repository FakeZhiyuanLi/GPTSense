      According to my friend Claire,  boyfriend sickness  is an actual disorder that affects many women (and men)across the world.  Symptoms of the sickness include, but are not limited, to: antisocial behavior, increased sleep, alcohol abuse, moodiness, and crying spells.  Quite recently, one friend was reported to have a severe case of BS when she was vacationing in Las Vegas- it being very apparent that she was unable to make it out with the other girls due to the fact that she might have a chance to talk to a boyfriend on the phone. After receiving a large bouquet of red roses (bleh), she was fine- able to carry on with her vacation without being weighed down by the crippling BS. Were the roses to BS what Prozac is to OCD?  Why does it happen?  Could it be that spending every waking second with a boyfriend- and then being cut off completely- causes withdrawal symptoms?  Can there be another kind of boyfriend sickness, too?  Or would that be girlfriend sickness?  When you hang out with your boyfriend so much that you want to see your girlfriends?    Either way, it appears to be a vicious cycle of codependence.  Is it fear of losing this person?  Is BS able to be done away with?  If you leave your partner on good terms, will you get the disease?  Is it something that only occurs in new relationships?  Are people with jealousy issues going to suffer more from this baffling disease?  Or does it affect everyone?  Is there an equivalent for guys?

      It just occurred to me that I am a movie critic.  I do love to see movies.  On a different note, I have to tell a story of what happened to Brian and I on the way to work yesterday morning. He had to take me back to my place (all of my stuff there)- so we drove (his car as I don't have one)- we are coasting along- he is being a total goofball because afternoon Brian and morning Brian are two totally different ppl.  All of a sudden, he says look, and points to my right (out the passenger's side window).  I look.  It is a woman (a lil rough around the edges, yes).  She is traipsing along at a snail's pace, a jean jacket and skirt on.  Note:  The skirt was more of a garnish.  Her ENTIRE bottom was exposed (and we didn't get to see the front).  The best part?  It was as if nothing strange was happening.  Men in suits with steaming coffee were walking by her with nary a nod in her direction- just another morning in the District.  Brian and I were wiping our eyes, unable to accept that we were really seeing what we were seeing.  It wasn't as if we were in a sketchy neighborhood.  We were downtown- Starbucks on the left, Cosi on the right!  You know?  Totally weird.  A bit disturbing and also a great way to start the day- with an out-of-control laughing fit.

      Well, took Brian to see it last night.  Loved it.  Absolutely loved it.  I am not a Nicholas Sparks fan- but am, for sure, a true lover of the dramatic love story.  Brian liked it, too!  The chemistry was believable between the two- AND, most importantly, they didn't have fake Southern accents (which I despise!)...

      I can understand why some ppl are upset by the movie.  It is a bit on the extreme side- and presents only one side of a very controversial argument.  However, I thought it was refreshing to see the accusations blaring across the screen- with little opportunity for the other side to comment.  Why would Michael Moore-haters refuse to see the film?  Don't they need ammo to fight back?  I would love to sit down and talk to someone about why they disagree with the film (minus the norm from the neoconservatives:  He's a terrorist, he's a fat, lazy slob).  I mean a real argument.  Something that could actually convince me to consider Bush NOT fighting the war in Iraq for Oil.  All comments welcome.

      I think that the "island" off the coast of Dupont Circle rates tippy top on my list of most annoying things about DC.  It is the mipoint for getting across Mass. Ave- and it is certifiably the hottest place on earth.  You can try to avoid it.  You could, potentially, cross through the circle to get to the other side.  Only problem's that the little "go" man blinks for all of two seconds every, ommm, 5 minutes.  So, you cut your losses and cross through the island (as quickly as possible).  The worst things about this treeless, shrubless patch of concrete include, but are not limited to:  1.  Exposure to hot traffic (a bus goes by and the temp. increases by ten degrees, at least). 2.  A variety of panhandlers whom you have no choice but to acknowledge- typically they will be the only other person on the island. 3.  The fumes.  Period. 4.  The waiting process.  You are going, going, going, and you have to stop in the middle.  And don't even try to cross because you will be hit.  Almost certainly. 5.  The stranded feeling.

      It is hot outside today!&nbsp; It is hot, hot, hot!&nbsp; Almost uncomfortable.&nbsp; On the Metro (where I&nbsp;appreciated&nbsp;the cool air and the time to sit and ponder), I thought to myself, "I do not want to get off of this train and have to walk the distance from the metro to the office."&nbsp; It is a distance of no more than 50 yards!!!!&nbsp; Hahahahaha.&nbsp; I have to suck it up!&nbsp; Do other people think like this?&nbsp; Do other people just see it as another activity- wake up, drink coffee, walk to metro, get to work, check voicemail, dum dee dum.&nbsp;   Maybe.&nbsp; But I don't know.&nbsp; It is the sweat on my back.&nbsp; It is showing up to work feeling like I need a shower.&nbsp;   !  &nbsp;

       I know it was controversial.&nbsp; I know he spoke for 20 minutes.&nbsp; I know he was loud and boisterous.&nbsp; But I liked it!&nbsp; I liked his passion!&nbsp; Go Al!   A text of a speech by Al Sharpton, delivered at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night, as transcribed by e-Media, Inc.:  Thank you. Tonight I want to address my remarks in two parts. One, I'm honored to address the delegates here. Last Friday, I had the experience in Detroit of hearing President George Bush make a speech. And in the speech, he asked certain questions. I hope he's watching tonight. I would like to answer your questions, Mr. President.  document.write(' urlLink  ');  urlLink  To the chairman, our delegates, and all that are assembled, we're honored and glad to be here tonight. I'm glad to be joined by supporters and friends from around the country. I'm glad to be joined by my family, Kathy, Dominique, who will be 18, and Ashley. We are here 228 years after right here in Boston we fought to establish the freedoms of America. The first person to die in the Revolutionary War is buried not far from here, a Black man from Barbados, named Crispus Attucks. Forty years ago, in 1964, Fannie Lou Hamer and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party stood at the Democratic convention in Atlantic City fighting to preserve voting rights for all America and all Democrats, regardless of race or gender. Hamer's stand inspired Dr. King's march in Selma, which brought about the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Twenty years ago, Reverend Jesse Jackson stood at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, again, appealing to the preserve those freedoms. Tonight, we stand with those freedoms at risk and our security as citizens in question. I have come here tonight to say, that the only choice we have to preserve our freedoms at this point in history is to elect John Kerry the president of the United States. I stood with both John Kerry and John Edwards on over 30 occasions during the primary season. I not only debated them, I watched them, I observed their deeds, I looked into their eyes. I am convinced that they are men who say what they mean and mean what they say. I'm also convinced that at a time when a vicious spirit in the body politic of this country that attempts to undermine America's freedoms -- our civil rights, and civil liberties -- we must leave this city and go forth and organize this nation for victory for our party and John Kerry and John Edwards in November. And let me quickly say, this is not just about winning an election. It's about preserving the principles on which this very nation was founded. Look at the current view of our nation worldwide as a results of our unilateral foreign policy. We went from unprecedented international support and solidarity on September 12, 2001, to hostility and hatred as we stand here tonight. We can't survive in the world by ourselves. How did we squander this opportunity to unite the world for democracy and to commit to a global fight against hunger and disease? This court has voted five to four on critical issues of women's rights and civil rights. It is frightening to think that the gains of civil and women rights and those movements in the last century could be reversed if this administration is in the White House in these next four years. I suggest to you tonight that if George Bush had selected the court in '54, Clarence Thomas would have never got to law school. This is not about a party. This is about living up to the promise of America. The promise of America says we will guarantee quality education for all children and not spend more money on metal detectors than computers in our schools. The promise of America guarantees health care for all of its citizens and doesn't force seniors to travel to Canada to buy prescription drugs they can't afford here at home. We did it with a go-it-alone foreign policy based on flawed intelligence. We were told that we were going to Iraq because there were weapons of mass destruction. We've lost hundreds of soldiers. We've spent $200 billion dollars at a time when we had record state deficits. And when it became clear that there were no weapons, they changed the premise for the war and said: No, we went because of other reasons. If I told you tonight, Let's leave the Fleet Center, we're in danger, and when you get outside, you ask me, Reverend Al, What is the danger? and I say, It don't matter. We just needed some fresh air, I have misled you and we were misled. We are also faced with the prospect of in the next four years that two or more of the Supreme Court Justice seats will become available. This year we celebrated the anniversary of Brown v. the Board of Education. The promise of America provides that those who work in our health care system can afford to be hospitalized in the very beds they clean up every day. The promise of America is that government does not seek to regulate your behavior in the bedroom, but to guarantee your right to provide food in the kitchen. The issue of government is not to determine who may sleep together in the bedroom, it's to help those that might not be eating in the kitchen. The promise of America that we stand for human rights, whether it's fighting against slavery in the Sudan, where right now Joe Madison and others are fasting, around what is going on in the Sudan; AIDS in Lesotho; a police misconduct in this country. The promise of America is one immigration policy for all who seek to enter our shores, whether they come from Mexico, Haiti or Canada, there must be one set of rules for everybody. We cannot welcome those to come and then try and act as though any culture will not be respected or treated inferior. We cannot look at the Latino community and preach one language. No one gave them an English test before they sent them to Iraq to fight for America. The promise of America is that every citizen vote is counted and protected, and election schemes do not decide the election. It, to me, is a glaring contradiction that we would fight, and rightfully so, to get the right to vote for the people in the capital of Iraq in Baghdad, but still don't give the federal right to vote for the people in the capital of the United States, in Washington, D.C. Mr. President, as I close, Mr. President, I heard you say Friday that you had questions for voters, particularly African- American voters. And you asked the question: Did the Democratic Party take us for granted? Well, I have raised questions. But let me answer your question. You said the Republican Party was the party of Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. It is true that Mr. Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, after which there was a commitment to give 40 acres and a mule. That's where the argument, to this day, of reparations starts. We never got the 40 acres. We went all the way to Herbert Hoover, and we never got the 40 acres. We didn't get the mule. So we decided we'd ride this donkey as far as it would take us. Mr. President, you said would we have more leverage if both parties got our votes, but we didn't come this far playing political games. It was those that earned our vote that got our vote. We got the Civil Rights Act under a Democrat. We got the Voting Rights Act under a Democrat. We got the right to organize under Democrats. Mr. President, the reason we are fighting so hard, the reason we took Florida so seriously, is our right to vote wasn't gained because of our age. Our vote was soaked in the blood of martyrs, soaked in the blood of good men (inaudible) soaked in the blood of four little girls in Birmingham. This vote is sacred to us. This vote can't be bargained away. This vote can't be given away. Mr. President, in all due respect, Mr. President, read my lips: Our vote is not for sale. And there's a whole generation of young leaders that have come forward across this country that stand on integrity and stand on their traditions, those that have emerged with John Kerry and John Edwards as partners, like Greg Meeks, like Barack Obama, like our voter registration director, Marjorie Harris, like those that are in the trenches. And we come with strong family values. Family values is not just those with two-car garages and a retirement plan. Retirement plans are good. But family values also are those who had to make nothing stretch into something happening, who had to make ends meet. I was raised by a single mother who made a way for me. She used to scrub floors as a domestic worker, put a cleaning rag in her pocketbook and ride the subways in Brooklyn so I would have food on the table. But she taught me as I walked her to the subway that life is about not where you start, but where you're going. That's family values. And I wanted somebody in my community -- I wanted to show that example. As I ran for president, I hoped that one child would come out of the ghetto like I did, could look at me walk across the stage with governors and senators and know they didn't have to be a drug dealer, they didn't have to be a hoodlum, they didn't have to be a gangster, they could stand up from a broken home, on welfare, and they could run for president of the United States. As you know, I live in New York. I was there September 11th when that despicable act of terrorism happened. A few days after, I left home, my family had taken in a young man who lost his family. And as they gave comfort to him, I had to do a radio show that morning. When I got there, my friend James Entome (ph) said, Reverend, we're going to stop at a certain hour and play a song, synchronized with 990 other stations. I said, That's fine. He said, We're dedicating it to the victims of 9/11. I said, What song are you playing? He said America the Beautiful. The particular station I was at, the played that rendition song by Ray Charles. As you know, we lost Ray a few weeks ago, but I sat there that morning and listened to Ray sing through those speakers, Oh beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain, for purple mountains' majesty across the fruited plain. And it occurred to me as I heard Ray singing, that Ray wasn't singing about what he knew, because Ray had been blind since he was a child. He hadn't seen many purple mountains. He hadn't seen many fruited plains. He was singing about what he believed to be. Mr. President, we love America, not because all of us have seen the beauty all the time. But we believed if we kept on working, if we kept on marching, if we kept on voting, if we kept on believing, we would make America beautiful for everybody. Starting in November, let's make America beautiful again. Thank you. And God bless you.

      It's the hump day.&nbsp; Wednesday.&nbsp; Got up this morning and biked home to my place- started the day at 7 AM!&nbsp; I like to get that extra boost of energy in the morning (almost never happens!).&nbsp; Iam reading the absolute BEST book right now- In the Lake of the Woods (no, not John Grisham or Stuart Woods).&nbsp; Written by Tim O'Brien.&nbsp; I am hooked.&nbsp; Last night I got through about 130 pages and had to cut myself off so that I could get some rest.  Do not wear flip flops in the rain.&nbsp; Did it again this morning (for comfort on my walk to the Metro).&nbsp; I ended up flopping all of nature's trash onto my skirt (which is, thankfully, dark).&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Okay.&nbsp; I have been irritated with this "blogger" for some time now- because she posts links to videos of beheadings, etc.&nbsp; Here is a recent correspondence.&nbsp; It was a bit tense.&nbsp; I cannot copy and paste the original text (to which I responded)- but, trust me, it was the dumbest thing you've ever seen.  &nbsp; Comments: The Difference Between a Republican and a Democrat  A Republican gave a homeless person money AND offered him a job? Not likely. The Republican probably scoffed at the homeless person and threw pennies at him. The Democrat knew him by name and offered to take him to lunch. Puleeze.Posted by  urlLink Ashley  on July 27, 2004 10:12 AM   Yo Miss Ashley, who asked you? Next time I want your opinion I'll ask for it. Jennifer sendsPosted by  urlLink Jennifer Martinez  on July 27, 2004 10:23 AM   Ashley, I can see you've been brainwashed about Republicans. Yes, Repubs really do want to help folks. We don't want to just give them a handout, especially a handout which is someone else's money! Democrats, OTOH, are always big at raising other people's taxes to pay for things they think people want. For example, the liberals (actually, socialists) up here in the People's Republic of Ann Arbor (Michigan) have raised our taxes to preserve the "green space" around the city. They're so arrogantly anti-development that I always remind them that the house they're living in currently used to be a field or a forest in times past. I also remind them that if they want to preserve the "empty fields" that *they* must use *their own money* to buy the land and keep it vacant! They just don't get it.  To make a long story short, the Dems want to give a poor person a fish (that the Repubs paid for, BTW!), while Repubs want to teach the poor person to fish so that he'll be able to feed himself (or herself, in Ashley's case!). But that would require work, and that's quite possibly why some folks are poor--because they just plain don't want to work. And why should they, as long as they get liberal dupes to keep giving them "free" money!?Posted by  urlLink Garry K  on July 27, 2004 10:34 AM   Actually, I come from a very conservative family in GA. I know how to fish. I know all about Republicans and Democrats. Anyway, I think that a lot of time is put into this blog. No problems there. It is a bit unfortunate that there is little debate allowed. Ciao.Posted by  urlLink Ashley  on July 27, 2004 10:46 AM   Gary K You've heard the old axiom, give a man a fish and he'll have a meal, teach a man to fish and he'll sit in a boat all day drinking beer ? :)Posted by  urlLink Bill Hubbard  on July 27, 2004 10:52 AM   Ashley (and Jennifer) - I agree with you about there being little room for debate on this site. It IS unfortunate in my opinion as well, as I feel that differing views makes things more interesting. I've actually posted here before only to have my comment(s) deleted. Ah well. It's just funny to be able to strike a nerve with some people so easily...Posted by  urlLink ~Hokiegal~  on July 27, 2004 10:59 AM   Ashley you are so well potty trained, but pause to look at the differences. A Democrat will give the unemployed welfare, food stamps, free, free, etc. The Republicans give some of the same, but try to wean the "stay in trouble people" from living off the true workers in society. A Democrat rewards unwed moms by giving them more for each child they bring into this world. The Republicans give some of the same benefits, but ideate that after 3 children, it's no longer an accident. Hell, if it'll keep any woman from bringing more unwanted children into this world, I have the best solution. St. Josephs aspirin is the premier birth control in the world. When a woman feels vulnerable, all you have to do is take that little orange pill and place it firmly between your knees. Careful, don't let it drop! See, that eliminates questions about abortion, who's the daddy, who is going to support them, etc. Ashley "free" is not free. For every freebie program, the working population has to pay. If I'm paying to raise a child, I think I should have a right to name him. (Pete, rePete,etc.) If any person in America thinks that we will always be free, without investing in freedom, you need to start learning a foreign language. I am a male single parent who raised three great children, and two grandchildren. And I have taxes taken out of every check to support the less fortunate. Because I choose to work, and my children are not on any "giveme" programs, I have to contribute to the less fortunate. Give me a break.Posted by  urlLink Joseph Anderson  on July 27, 2004 11:09 AM   Hokiegal, Just exactly what did you say in an effort to stimulate healthy debate for which you were so unjustly censured? Was it something like Bush = Hitler or returning Vietnam vets being spat upon was just a myth or US military personnel are nothing but hapless pawns for an imperialistic, hegemonic administration or Republicans are crass and uncaring? Was it something like that?Posted by  urlLink Mike M  on July 27, 2004 11:20 AM  Mike M,  It has been a long time since I had posted on this site since Jennifer and I obviously disagree on many issues and I didn't feel as if she was open to hearing me out. However, if I remember correctly, no - I don't think anything I said was as absurd as the examples/suggestions you mentioned. I'm not ignorant. But, I cannot give you exact examples. I know that the dialouge I had with Jennifer had to do with the Isreali-Palestinian conflict. That's about as exact as I can get. I understand that this is Jennifer's blog and that she has a right to express her feelings/thoughts/ideas, etc., and I respect that. However, that doesn't mean that I have to agree with her sentiments and I think that's healthy. That's all I'm saying.Posted by  urlLink ~Hokiegal~  on July 27, 2004 11:39 AM   Ashley, Give me a break.  you Ashley, are a narrow minded idiot. Now go donate to the DNC Posted by  urlLink static  on July 27, 2004 11:48 AM   Ashley, dumb me. I just figured out that you can't read, but you can babble. This is a 50-50 site. Did anyone invite you? How much money did you spend to advertise your views on this site? We, the proud Jennifercrats, enjoy posting comments about the things in life we feel are important. And, little debate allowed? What in the hell are you smoking? We are a cross-section of society. Race,color,creed, nationality doesn't matter. Nobody is going to ask, so all the information you give, I suppose, is willingly. Is there anyone making you speak? You have stated that you are doing investigating for a firm, bullshit. Investigators do not get involved, read you employment papers. Have you responded to Democratic or Liberal sites? Just smile and say cheese.Posted by  urlLink Joseph Anderson  on July 27, 2004 11:51 AM   Static? Perhaps you might consider anger management classes. Lemme guess- you oftentimes find yourself in situations where people are offended by your less than courteous reaction to their practice of free speech? I know a lot of people just like you.  Narrowminded idiot? I have already donated to the DNC. Posted by  urlLink Ashley  on July 27, 2004 11:56 AM   The single biggest predicter on whether a child is being raised in poverty isn't skin color. It isn't location. It isn't the educational level of the parent(s).It is whether or not that child is being raised by two parents living in the same home.You, Ashley and Hokiegal can come into Jennifer's home and insult her and her friends, doesn't change a thing. We all know which Party worked so hard to destroy the family structure of the poor.We further know which Party 'stood in the schoolhouse door' back in the '60s to prevent poor minority children from getting into the somewhat better schools.We also know which Party is now standing in the doors of failing schools to prevent poor minority children from getting out and into better schools.The Democrat Party stood for slavery before and during the Civil War. After the Civil War the Democrats were the Parrty of the Klu Klux Klan. It was Democrat Senators who filibustered the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts.Today the money of the Teacher's Unions is more important to the Dems than the futures of minority children.Some things havent changed in 150 years. The Democrats being the Party of Racism is one of those things. Only the rhetoric has changed.Posted by  urlLink Peter  on July 27, 2004 12:00 PM   Two words for you: New Deal.Posted by  urlLink Ashley  on July 27, 2004 12:05 PM   Not to forget our favorite Hokiegal. You obviously have a vast amount of knowledge and experience to bring to the table (even though you graduated in 1999). But, giving you the benefit of doubt, I have re-read your post about three times. You place blame, but you don't offer an alternative. (ie., If you get pregnant, it's his fault, he should have taken precautions). I enjoyed taking with you.Posted by  urlLink Joseph Anderson  on July 27, 2004 12:07 PM   Peter, No where have I insulted Jennifer and/or her friends. In fact, I have tried hard to do the opposite. I was merely stating what I have personally experienced while visiting and commenting on this site. I didn't and don't plan on attacking others to try to prove a point or to try to get others to agree with me. It's too bad that you don't feel the same way.Posted by  urlLink ~Hokiegal~  on July 27, 2004 12:13 PM   Joseph, In all sincerity, I really do not agree with you that I place blame anywhere in my posts. Furthermore, my initial comment dealt with the issue I have with resentment from others who disagree with what I have posted in the past. And, I did offer an alternative: respect differing views. You don't have to agree them, but respect them. It is my experience with posting on this site in the past that opposing views are not appreciated. Things may have changed, but frankly I don't feel like defending my views on a board where participants in the past have not been respectful of opposing views, so I'm sorry if I didn't offer enough of an alternative for you. As far as when I graduated, I think it's very petty and ignorant of anyone to base another person's intelligence merely on the age of that person. Great talking with you too though...Posted by  urlLink ~Hokiegal~  on July 27, 2004 12:24 PM  no - I don't think anything I said was as absurd as the examples/suggestions you mentioned.  Hokiegal, I didn't simply dream up those examples/suggestions. I've seen all those ridiculous sentiments expressed on these pages before they were properly deleted by the site owner.  Showing solidarity with and support for Palestinian terrorists is a good one, though. I couldn't imagine why Jennifer would object to someone using her resources to defend and espouse the virtues of maniacal killers like them. Posted by  urlLink Mike M  on July 27, 2004 12:30 PM  Damn, I take the wife to her doctor appointment and miss out on all this. I only have one thing to add to this topic, Democrats and Republicans this seems to be the crux of the whole political system. What happened to the American People? Do we not matter anymore? Look at our political system today, each party is fighting to get elected/re-elected, not one of those bitches and sons of bitches cares one hairy little rat's ass about the people. The only thing that matters is getting into office, getting the power, and getting the money by any means possible. Does anyone wonder why a person will spend hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars to get elected to a job that pays nothing in comparrison to the money spent? Piss on the people and their needs. I'm getting a little tired in my old age of watching these grinning assholes get in front of crowds and promise everyone everything, and when they get into office, they don't even bring the K-Y Jelly when they bend you over. Done with my rant. Thank youPosted by  urlLink AndyJ  on July 27, 2004 12:35 PM   Mike M, Like I said, I cannot remember exactly what I said. However, I highly doubt it was anything as strong as what you're suggesting. I challenge you to prove me wrong. As far as "showing solidarity with and support for Palestinian terrorists" - I have never and will never be a part of that. I think you have conveniently distorted my orginial comment(s) and I am not going to waste any more engery trying to explain my views.  This is all reminding me why I quit posting on this site in the first place. I am learning that things haven't changed much around here since then. I'm going to refrain from any more comments (much to your shagrin, I'm sure) and allow you to carry on with your day. Have fun.Posted by  urlLink ~Hokiegal~  on July 27, 2004 12:42 PM   "It is a bit unfortunate that there is little debate allowed" As my friend and fellow blogger Bonfire said, "my blog my way." Why don't you create a blog, Ashely, and set it up for debating purposes? The thing is, I didn't create this as a place for debating. I'm not interested in debating and to be honest with you, I just don't give a hoot as to what dems think or feel. "publish links to graphic images of terrorist actions" I have an assortment of links to graphic images? I don't remember that. I do have the Berg video but I sure as hell ain't promoting it. I think that Americans need to see this. They need to take their heads out of the sand, in my opinion, and wake up before its too late.  The fact that you give money to the DNC tells me that you are not someone I would enjoy talking with. Again, that's my opinion.  BTW, I don't let Dems in my house either. Yes I do ask. If you're a dem, see ya, you're not welcome in my home.  Jennifer sendsPosted by  urlLink Jennifer Martinez  on July 27, 2004 01:12 PM   Amen Jennifer. Ashley and her ilk are nothing but Asshats anywaysPosted by  urlLink static  on July 27, 2004 01:22 PM   I didn't realize that the internet was now a home. If more individuals like you would present themselves come RNC time, Kerry (for sure) will be elected. Keep up the good work! Asshat Posted by  urlLink Ashley  on July 27, 2004 01:37 PM   No, Hokiegal doesn't have to agree with me. That is true. No one has to agree with me. Perhaps I'm a bit grumpy today and when Hokiegal showed up and said I was being rude again, I deleted her comment. Rudeness is in the eye of the beholder. I felt that Miss Ash was being rude and then Hokie was backing her up.  I don't remember commo'ing with Hokiegirl in the past. Graduated in '99, ah, she's just a baby! A young 'un. Has her whole life ahead of her. And I mean that in a nice way.  I don't have a problem with anything you've posted today, HG.  We are just sick and tired of the fucking trolls and assorted others who barge in here and its not that they have a different opinion, they come in and first post is name calling, et al... I have even received death threats because I won't vote for Jean Pierre Hanoi John Kerry. Death threats!  I'll tell ya one thing, you vote for whomever you choose and I promise I won't threaten to kill you. That is the type of thing I have been dealing with and I've reached the end of my rope.  Now, I've got work to do. Jennifer sendsPosted by  urlLink Jennifer Martinez  on July 27, 2004 01:38 PM   Yes this place is like a home, to myself and my regulars. If you were to walk into my home and behave in this manner, we would kick you out. By the same token, I doubt you would invite us to sit down to dinner with your family.  The Internet is not a home, but to many bloggers, their little blog community which they created is akin to a home to them. If you would just sit down and create your own blog, spend years working on it, cultivating it, investing in it, etc, you would come to understand that.  Now Miss Ashley, I don't think there's anything else here for you. You'd be much more happier if you could locate a blog where you fit in nicely. Have a nice day.

      I love the weekends.&nbsp; For all of the things that occur that break up the monotony of the work week.&nbsp; Sleeping in.&nbsp; Dinner with friends.&nbsp; Saturday afternoons.&nbsp; Leisure time.&nbsp; In fact, I fully support a 4-day work week and would seriously consider a pay cut to test drive the idea.  I have just confirmed Albert's flight to Maine- going to take a long weekend on the coast with my two fave men, my twin and my love.&nbsp; It will be a blast.&nbsp; I can sic Brian on Albert and they can paddle upstream against the wind together- and they both will love it.&nbsp; Good times.  Brian has confessed that he is jealous of my new bike (which is soso cool) and that he has considered tying a concrete block to it and that tossing it into the Potomac with nary a care.&nbsp;

      I think I will get my bike today!&nbsp; Yipee.&nbsp; After weeks and months and years of researching bike styles and brands and seats and such, I have settled on a Specialized hybrid bike that works for my budget AND my needs.&nbsp; The guys at CIty Bikes have been nice enough to transport it from the Chevy Chase store over to Adams Morgan!&nbsp; Yeah!  Brian and I picked crabs last night outside of Annapolis.&nbsp; Quite a lovely evening- it's amazingly nice (and peaceful) to get out of the city for a little while.&nbsp; Slower pace.&nbsp; Sun setting.&nbsp; Amstel Light.&nbsp; Good times.&nbsp; We were really dirty and decided that I like the crab legs and he likes the body meat.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;I ate the legs and he ate the body and it was an efficient system.  Haven't seen any good movies lately.&nbsp; WIll not be seeing I,Robot or whatever that Will Smith, Armageddon-like, movie is.&nbsp; Yuck.&nbsp; Bleh.  &nbsp;

      Woke up this morning form a VERY deep slumber.&nbsp; B and I got in around 1 AM last night after spending another gazillion hours at Boston's Logan airport.&nbsp; That place is a layover trap.&nbsp; We were very tired but managed to keep ourselves entertained for most of the time.&nbsp; Maine was fabulous.&nbsp; The weeding was in Brooklin, on a grassy point overlooking the sea.&nbsp; Quite picturesque.&nbsp; The bride and groom were glowing, as brides and grooms tend to do.&nbsp; We danced and drank and laughed and talked.&nbsp; Good times.&nbsp;  &nbsp; We DID end up camping out- and it was fine.&nbsp; I snuggled up in Brian's sleeping bag- on top of about 20 blankets (think of a Princess having to "rough it"- and poor Brian was cold because I refused him his blankies- bless his heart.&nbsp;  &nbsp; We kayaked the coast on Sunday- and ate lobster rolls.&nbsp; Lovely.&nbsp; Actually, I am quite sore today.&nbsp; My arms and stomach (and legs?) are sore.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Wish I was back in Maine!&nbsp; I wasn't able to spend enough time there this trip.&nbsp; It is so refreshing, though- and my lungs feel new again!&nbsp;  &nbsp; Back to work...&nbsp;

      First of all, Brian brought to my attention that an anonymous blooger said I look like Julia Roberts.  Not the case.  We both have big mouths- that's about it, though.  Moving on- today was a lovely morning.  It wasn't quite as hot out as it has been recently.  I am sure that will change.  If anyone gets a chance, go to the MSN.com website and check out Slate Magazine's red or blue quiz.  It's a good time.  The stereotypes are hilarious (Who is Lee Greenwood?, etc.)...  On another front, it looks like Bush pays his male employees 22% more (on average) than his female employees.  A recently published list of salaries confirms this.  Hmmm....

      Well, folks- Last night was Brian's birthday.  A momentous occasion.  We had a scavenger hunt for his gifts and drank a bottle of champagne- then went to Tabard Inn for dinner and had a bottle of wine.  A wonderful occasion.  He was sososo full after eating 2 desserts that we had to lay him down, put a fan on him, and rub his belly.  Hilarious.  I am at work today and have been out for the morning due to a fire drill.  Fire drill?  It was more like 9/11 at the WTC.  The hallways were jammed.  It took 20 minutes to get outside.  Not very reassuring.   I'm lookin' for a new bike.  I might purchase the Specialized bike that I tested at City Bikes.

      Well, folks.  After having been banned from my blog for 2 full workdays, I'm back with a vengeance.  Kerry and Edwards, huh?  I like it!  I don't like that Republicans are already playing up their "liberalism", though- Why do they make that sound like a bad thing?  And, he Edwards doesn't have enought experience in foreign policy and war?  Good, maybe we could take a break for a little while.  Anyway, today is a good day to start my business I have been planning for a while.  I am going to start a lemonade stand with internet connection capabilities.  You know- a hotdog stand (minus the hotdogs) with lemonade and reffreshments- where people can stop in and check their email- or whatever!  Hahahaha!  A perfect day.  It is so hot out- ppl need the sweet relief.

      Don't you just hate when you have computer troubles at work?  My friend recently picked up a nasty virus while surfing the internet for progesterone medication- because she hadn't had a period in a while and the progesterone is supposed to speed up your cycle.  So?  She was prey to the giant IT monster.  (Luckily, the matter was handled over the phone).  When I arrived at my desk this morning, I quickly got online to check my blog, etc.  Popups.  Everywhere.  First thought?  I have to call Tony (our IT guy).  My friend just enabled a virus that multiplied 200 times in about 30 miunutes- I can't let that happen to my office just because I didn't want Tony to know about my recent purchases at ebags.com, Amazon, or Banana.    I ended up scribbling a little note, something like "Tony.  Popups.  Problem.  Can't google.  Ashley."  In the meantime, I am scrolling through my list of sites, Oh God!  SO many.  None related to work.  I am so irresponsible.  Basically, my guilty conscience propelled me into active work mode- I managed to get 2 hours worth of work done in about 2 minutes.  Anyway, it wasn't pretty.  Tony came down- and had remarkable bedside manner-like an oncologist.  "Show me where the problem is.  What are the symptoms?  Have you been exposed to anything particularly hazardous?"  I tried to keep up the conversation- perhaps to distract him from judging me for websurfing at work.  He clicked away, and in about five minutes, was done.  He stood up, said "All better,"  and then asked me about my weekend plans.  And then he was gone.  Whoooooo.  Much better.

      Well, we are back to Code Orange in DC.  At our staff meeting this morning, our HR person reminded us to wear our badges at all times.  And I couldn't help but wonder if badges would help to identify persons in case of an emergency or if they were a means of keeping a constant eye on suspicious activity in the building.  Either way, not a comforting thought.  Anyway, the warning was issued to the World Bank building (which might be at H and 18?).  Not too far away...  I can't stop thinking about the nature or need for these code variations.  I mean, if authorities have specific-enough evidence to prove that the World Bank might be bombed, what good does it do to issue these blanket warnings to the city?  Do they know something else, too?  Are these warnings real?  Is there really a threat to the city's people?  Can the President of the World Bank (Jim something or other) keep his employees at work under such conditions?  I remember when the Twin Towers went down- and the reactions of everyone around me- wondering why anyone would carry on with their daily work duties after a plane had plowed into the office upstairs...  This is not unlike that situation.  I mean, the government issues a clear and present danger warning and there are still people working as usual.  Not that I blame them, of course.  I would do the same thing.  Its unfortunate, though.  I would like to think that, under such a situation, work activity could be suspended temporarily...But for how long?  Its quite impossible, I guess.  And I assume that the WB is always under some sort of watch...  I hope that the World Bank President has a lot more information than I do...
