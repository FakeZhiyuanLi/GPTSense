        You know what is so bloody annoying? When really slim/skinny people think they are fat. Fair few of my friends for example. I'm not the slimest of people so it really grates my cheese when slim people like Stacey fr example go on saying they are fat. Had a go at her at work today. Was fun. She sulked for a bit before she talked properly to me.

       First of all, Laura hasn't got the whole "ooo argh" thing yet! She's like "ohhhhhh arrrr" or summit daft like that!       And second of all,   I FRIGGIN HATE SPIDERS! GAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!   :@ I have more than one spider story. I am miss spider story of the year the moment it seems. Well, here is my first story...      At Laurens house the other week, think it might have been two weekends gone, after we had been out, all of us just sitting minding our own business when Lauren started screaming like there was an axe murderer was standing behind Colin. Was funny, took a while for me and Colin to register Lauren screaming like a banshee. When we finally clicked, we looked around and saw this fooking   HUGE   spider running across the wall! Lauren ran to get her mammy while I sat there going "omigod omigod omigod". Colin just laughed at us being arseholes.      My second story is also at Laurens. We went outside as it was bloody roasting in Laurens room, and as the window doesn't open far, there was no other option. Looking around the yard, I looked at the windowsil, and what happens to be sitting there? A dirty great big spider. Actually, it wasn't that big.      My next spider story however is at my own home. Was horrid. Minding my own business in the shower and what happens to waltz in standing over my, when I was vunerable, another ugly bloody spider! Screamed for a bit until I managed to finsh my shower and left the bathroom sharply. Later that day I saw another spider. Scream at that too. Then when I was going to bed, I noticed yet another spider with a baby spider next to it. Couldn't scream though as daddy was in bed. Went into the bathroom and what happened to be climbing over the toothpaste? Yeah, you guessed it. Another freaking spider! Gaaaah! Those spiders decided to and sit outside the bathroom, they must have felt a bit of niceness seeping through them, gave us a bit of privacy.      This was until saturday night. A bloody spider decided to attack me when I was on the loo. Well, not on the loo, but near enough. Well, I went to go to the loo but noticed this dangling. Went to swot it thinking it was a fly but then noticed it was a spider. I ran back to the computer. Braving myself, i went to inspect where the spider was. It was a lot higher up, so braving it, I went to the loo. I had a nasty feeling the spider was lurking and was getting ready to get me. You know what it did when i opened the toilet door?   BLOODY FLEW INTO THE TOILET!   This made me jump back, hurting my legs on the loo and wacking Henry the cat in the process with the bloody door. Couldn't get out that loo for ages! Gahh.        My next spider story is yet again at Laurens. Her house seems to be a spider nest and make my spiders look like bloody ants! Sacha and myself were just sitting watching the TV when i heard "omigod" from Sacha. Looked at the floor and a bloody tarantula (bit of an exaggeration) ran across the room! I just went   "AAAAAAAAAAAAH LAUREN!!!!!!!!!" ,  she came running in going "what?" and we were just like "spider under th TV!!!!". Lozza went to get a glass but while she did the spider came running for me. Ran under the sofa actually. Then about two minutes later it ran onto my jacket. We got the glass and put it under it, waiting for Laurens mammy to come home. The spider got really angry under the glass. Twas amusing looking at it going nutz.       This now come to my final story, as of today. Three spiders i saw within the space of   FIVE BLOODY MINUTES!   And within   FIVE BLOODY METRES OF EACH OTHER!   :@ One was in the shower, well above it when i was in it, the other two were sitting next to each other in the hallway. Then when I went outside i noticed a   HUGE   one in the hedge, and a baby one in the hedge underneath it. Then at the metrostation I saw another   HUGE   one, and a baby one about two metres away from it.      Well, they are my spider stories, if I have anymore, I shall keep you posted...      (wonder how much of an essay this was lol... we shall see....)

        Work is proper shit. Had an arguement today with Warren, and he took it further than he should have. Fair enough I printed something out that I shouldn't have, but he didn't have to keep going on, calling me stuff when I was asking him nicely not too. Fair enough i grief Michael, but not Warren. Fucking tard.

        :O I have four virus' on my computer! Bloody things. Why did some arsehole have to think they were being all clever and decide to make them. Fair enough it gives people jobs, the people who get them off for us, but it is still shit, and why the hell did they have to do it in the first bloody place?? Grrrg!

        OMG like... Totally bored. Can't actually think of anything to say in this thing either. Oh no wait. I have. Totally smelled yesterday like. Smelt like cowpat :D Aren't I just so cool eh? Had to clean myself 3 times before the dirty actually came off me. Imagine what I'm going to be like when I come back from bloody Leeds Festival! Well, there I'm going to be slightly more prepared. Going to have wipes to semi-clean myself - not going in the showers if there is any. That can Fcuk right off like! I'm probably not going to go to the toilet very often. If I need a shit, think I am just going to shit in a bush. And piss in the bushes. How pleasant am I?
