        Love is an emotion,                               Love is uncontrollable,                          When you fall in Love,                           Sometimes it is good,                            Sometimes it is bad,                              It is Cruel 4 someone,                            Who Likes a person,                              But the person don't Like him/her,       It is happiness 4 someone,                   Who Likes a person,                             & the person Likes him/her,                  Love can hurt a person,                        Really easily,                                          It can also make a person happy,          Really easily too!                                    So......                                                     if you find Love Cruel,                           Stop Liking the person You Like,          If not......                                                 You will feel really sad......                     & if you find Love means,                      happiness,                                              DON'T STOP Liking the person,            You like......                                            Cause...... You will be really happy,      One day...... Or maybe not......               Cause, Love is unpredictable,               When both of you are ready to,             get married......                                       A person will suddenly,                         Not Like You anymore,                          But he/she is attracted to,                     Another person......                                But don't be sad......                               There is always a hope......

      everytime i see his name appear on my phone my heart will skip a beat.. but who knows tat today his name bring bad news...(-_-)   i open e msg... and start readin. From e first few words i knew tat somethin was wrong somethin bad was goin to happen...   when i read my tears started to drop... my heart is breakin into thousand and million of pieces..  i was thinkin y is tis happenin to me...??? i hope tat it was juz a dream but it is real..   i dunno wat have i done wrong .. he told me tat he was busy and have got no time 4 me.. tat was his reason of e break up but i noe tat was not e real reason..   everyone is tellin me different things.. one told me tat he has no feelin 4 me and tat im only some kinda substitute to him... another told me tat its because of my friend .. if it is really becouse of my friend who have disturb him .. den y did he wan to break up wif me??? it's my FRIEND not Me!! i've learn my lesson not to lent my phone to anyone anymore..  i guess tat i wont be able to find out the real reason...
