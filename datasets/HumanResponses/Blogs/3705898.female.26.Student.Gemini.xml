      How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd;                                                              - Alexander Pope

      I watched Pride and Prejudice again last night. This might be the fourth time but I liked it as much as I did the first time I watched it, which is a lot.  I can't make up my mind if it is Darcy I like more or Firth, it perplexes me, I think it is a bit of both of them. Ms Eliza Bennet is again one of my favorite female fictional characters, she belongs in an age where women only gossiped, knitted, made hats and fell in love, yet she stands out, she did all those things but her wit and intelligence stands her apart. I love the thing that goes on with her and Darcy, the way he creeps into her affections without her knowing.  Jane is too nice I think, I find that her objective of finding good in everyone is a little far fetched and thus I am inclined to think that she is not very smart. For some reason I like Mr. Collins. I love the way Austen has created him, full of false prestige. I think I am going to buy the book, I can't seem to find the copy I had as a child, so its time to get a new one.

      Yann Martel tells the story of a boy and a tiger with such simplistic ease that somewhere in the corner of your mind, you wonder if he is playing with your head. His description of the zoo and all the animals is so vivid and brilliant, the picture he paints of Pondicherry so colorful and the way that he finds so many distinctive and vibrant characters in the middle of a cold, pale and meaningless ocean is simply unforgettable.  In his own subtle way Martel reminds you that there is a God up there, in any form or avatar you seek him. He doesn't throw religion at your face but makes you look through the eyes of a teenage boy who is trying to discover his faith. He does find that that faith and combined with his willpower to live, he survives to tell his tale.

      Reality television, in all its corniness, is here to stay, at least for the moment. In a country that lives for and by entertainment, these shows go to abysmal lows to provide just what the audience wants.   We all want to be a part of the live TV shenanigans, and if we can't make it there, we root for people we think are reflections of ourselves. We watch them battle it out, face the limelight and dazzle in their moments of glory, because somewhere deep down, we want to be them. American Idol is one of the shows that draws you in stealthily with the promise of the rags-to-riches story - average people just like you and me with their one chance to shine. The catch is, the show lets you and me get them there. And when they are there basking in the limelight, in a way aren't we all?  On Americal Idol, voters feel that they will resurrect a sinking contestant but don't realize that a lack of that very vote is causing another contestant to sink. The voter base consists largely of the teenybopper category, the show having become an obsession with young teens throughout America. It's not the judges, the channel or the producers who choose the winner. We choose the winner. Beside the demographic voters, there are some other kinds of voters. The irrational voter votes for someone he doesn't like in an attempt to get rid of someone he hates. The identity voter votes for a contestant on the basis of with whom he or she connects the most on the basis of religion, race or looks. The cheap-thrill voter votes for who he or she thinks is the sexiest on screen based primarily on who is showing the most skin. The rational voter probably accounts for the least number of votes in the contest because he or she votes for real talent.    The show pulls you along and gives you the power to make a winner. Unplugged from the show you have no razzle-dazzle, no villainous judge and no fearful contestants. The drama diminishes, the melodrama dies and you are left with voices that seem far less captivating. It takes the show to make a diva but not to make a star. It sometimes feels like we all live in the Truman Show, for our reactions are all a consequence of someone else's actions. Reality TV is like that; it's all an act in the joy of entertainment. As long as it does not become an obsession with reality TV buffs and young impressionable teenagers, it's all good.  Reality on television is not real. It is distorted, sprinkled with controversy and moves further away from the real world with each atrocious show. How many William Hungs would make it big in the real world? The boy with a bad voice was transformed into a star and has a huge fan following and his own CD. Many people who audition for Idol think they can sing. They are let down and told to leave in the harshest manner possible. It's not possible in real life, but fine on reality TV.  The shows are everywhere, from transforming "ugly ducklings," as the advertisement puts it, into beauty queens to making marriage into a big joke. People are curious; they love the media, the dirty gossip it brings and they love the fact that it intrudes people's privacy. Reality TV is voyeurism at its best. It creeps into people's lives, their struggles and joys, and brings it all neatly packaged into our living rooms. The sanctity of marriage, the values of privacy and various other moral issues seem to have disappeared somewhere along the way. Like all other things that are fleeting, the success of reality TV will soon fade away, but for now we are in a real world dominated by the surrealism of reality TV.
