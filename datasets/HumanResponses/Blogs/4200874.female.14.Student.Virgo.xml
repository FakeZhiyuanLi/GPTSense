           [music : Feels Like Home, Chantal Kreviazuk]    [mood : Frustrated]       Well, this is my first post & I'm trying to make my blog as pretty as possible. So frustrating. Aaargh. Just testing out how my post will look like so I'll be satisfied &amp; won't be as irritated as I am now.       -Peace Out!-       Somethin' in your eyes, makes me wanna lose myself      Makes me wanna lose myself, in your arms      There's somethin' in your voice, makes my heart beat fast      Hope this feeling lasts, the rest of my life           If you knew how lonely my life has been      And how long I've been so alone      And if you knew how I wanted someone to come along      And change my life the way you've done           It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me      It feels like I'm all the way back where I come from      It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me      It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong           A window breaks, down a long, dark street      And a siren wails in the night      But I'm alright, 'cause I have you here with me      And I can almost see, through the dark there is light           Well, if you knew how much this moment means to me      And how long I've waited for your touch      And if you knew how happy you are making me      I never thought that I'd love anyone so much           It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me      It feels like I'm all the way the back where I come from      It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me      It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong      It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong    Currently one of my favourite songs. Probably be one of my favourites for the rest of my life

       [music : Stand, Jewel]    [mood : erm... indescribable]       okies, TRL's on & so's Usher! C'mon people, usher? What's the hype? The artist of 2004? Oh come ON! Sucking up much. Geez... how utterly embarrassing. His abs... sorry y'all, it does ABSOLUTELY nothing to me... a little TOO toned to me. 5 VMA nominations... okay I'll admit that's impressive BUT Beyonce, Outkast &amp; Justin Timberlake got 5 nominations last year as well. Plus, what makes people think that he'll win 'em all anyway! Sheesh... too much praise & flattery. I sure as hell hope he doesn't win 'em all (I know... IMPOSSIBLE! A girl CAN dream!)       Anyhow, SHOCKER! Apparently, Justin Timberlake proposed to Cameron Diaz - from the Sun & some other Daily sumthin, seriously can't remember what it's called. Not reliable sources, tabliods I think. HOPEFULLY, it's a farce. Nothing against Diaz, but I'd rather Timberlake marry someone younger, and NOT as 23. He's too young for God's sakes! Maybe when he's older &amp; not to Diaz although they seem really happy together. Perhaps there's someone out there who compliments him perfectly... better than Diaz does, DEFINITELY better than Spears.       Feel pretty proud of myself! Completed ALL my homework for the weekend, at least those that I've recieved. I can concentrate on preparing for the 4 tests next week then during the weekend! Even managed Amath! WOOHOO! Ahem... Let's see : Biology, Geog Elective, Lit - KOTC & English... oh boy, sure hope I'll be able to make it. DEFINITELY need to improve!       THE APPRENTICE : must watch y'all! ;)       -Peace Out!-     Mothers weep, children sleep      So much violence ends in silence      It's a shame there's no one to blame      For all the pain that life brings      If u will just take me It might just complete me      And together we can make a stand

           [music : On the way down, Ryan Cabrera]    [mood : Pretty Satisfied & Hopeful]       Friday! Finally the weekend. 3 days of school was all it took to tire me out! NOT good. Ooh... Jade gave me that Salmon thingy Majella was eating the day before. SO nice of her. Pleasantly surprised. I'm  definitely  one lucky gal, not only to have such pals, but just for being... lucky! ;)       Oh wait... so contradicting myself here... Not too lucky coz I do have homework, contrary to what I'd been hoping for. Well, at least it's just a G.E worksheet. Not forgetting my revision for the tests next week.       Okay so here's the plan. Finish up G.E worksheet, highlight important points & rearrange notes in G.E textbook to prepare for G.E test. Read King of the Castle. Do the same for Biology. That's only for tomorrow. And on Sunday, Biology all the way. Sure as hell hope I won't screw this organised, brilliant &amp; beneficial plan of mine like I always do. Cross my fingers.       Got locked out of my home today for about 15 minutes while my sister was having her shower inside. She used 20 cubic metres of water, good? Or bad? I serioualy have no clue. Oh & English lesson was a BORE. Lilo &amp; Stitch? Oh c'mon. What a DUMB show! Really pissed about both, waste of MY time! Anyhow, was barely watching the movie... reading Anna Karenina. Made progress. Perhaps I shall read that book during the weekend dring my 'breaks'. Not a bad idea... FAT CHANCE.       And I wonder what happened during Amath remedial today (muahahaha). :P        Oooh... more gossip. Firstly, this damn well better be a rumour. I'm pretty sure it is. This just isn't allowed to happen. Not in THIS decade at least.     Justin Timberlake is out of sync with his bandmates - and they're not happy about it. The most successful member of 'NSync recently broke the news to the other four warblers that he's not interested in being part of their next album. "Justin said he's not in the mood and doesn't think it will work," a source told People magazine. "He doesn't want any part of it." Maybe he's too busy romancing Cameron Diaz or working on his second solo album, but his old buddies are crying a river. "They aren't really talking to [Justin]," the insider said. "They haven't taken it so well." Timberlake's turnabout could spell an end to 'NSync, though their record label is hanging tough. "There's no album scheduled for this year from either 'NSync, Justin Timberlake or JC Chasez," a spokesman said. "The group is still together."

           [music : See It In A Boys Eyes, Jamelia]   [mood : Disappointed]      Simple Life!!! Braxton's SOOO CUTE!! Aaaahhh. Don't you just feel like hugging & cuddling the life outta him. (okay breathe in, breathe out). Can't get over it. When he placed tinkerbell on the slide... aaahhh. Tinks as he calls it. And when he sneezed while eating cereal. OH MY GOD. So adorable. I'm bodering on obsession here. But that's one of my weaknesses... cute little children. Especially little boys.    Anyhow, the show was HILARIOUS. I'm certainly gonna miss it. My saturday nights will now be a bore... (sigh). I hope they replace it with another reality series... comedy.. whatever... just as long &amp; I like it. crap I know. Just hope it's NOTHING like that new show...  My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance.  Lame much! Disgusting!      As i expected, I didn't manage to complete what I had planned to. I managed to read King of the Castle, plus make some notes. Check. I did go through my G.E textbook. Check. What i DIDn'T do was my Biology & the G.E worksheet. BUMMER. Guess I'll have to do it tomorrow then.       Soccer. LIVERPOOL DIDN'T WIN. A freakin draw. How sucky. Geez... damn that Defoe of however you spell it. Owen the T-R-A-I-T-O-R! Oh well, they don't need him anyway. Good Riddence!! Just need more strikers. Better get some fast! Oh & I hope ManU &amp; Chelsea get a draw as well today. If I'd pick one to win, it'll be ManU. Definitely.      Didn't touch anna karenina... kiss of the highlander instead. hehe.       Aarrgh... I'm on the verge of thinking that Justin is cocky! That friggin asshole may decide that he's done with Nsync. I mean WHAT THE HELL. Forgettin your roots much. He'd probably be nowhere near where he is now without Nsync. Just PRAY this is BuLL.       Oh well... sis bugging to use com AGAIN.      -Later Dayz...  Hopefully they're better than this -       What's a girl like me to do     When she don't get a thing from you     I wanna go where you're going to     Have to do what you have to do     What's a girl supposed to try     When all you do is criticise     Pretty soon you'll realise     I can see it, I can see it in a boy's eyes     see it in a boy's, see it in a boy's eyes

           [music : All Night, Janet Jackson]   [mood : Irritated]      Just found out that there's no Biology test next week. Maybe it's a good thing I didn't study then yesterday.       Woke up later then I was supposed to. AGAIN. oh well...      DAMN IT... So pissed of at my sis... LEAVE ME ALONE. Sheesh, she wants the com again.       Oh whatever.       -Till...um.. later?-       Work it like you're working a pole     Shake it 'til you're shaking the floor     Pop it like you're poppin' a cork     Don't Stop, Don't Stop     Jerk it like you're making it choke     Break it like you're breakin' a code     Drop it till you're taking it lower

           [music : Father Figure, George Michael]   [mood : pissed]      First of, the good news. Biology test postponed to next tuesday. No test during TOP period either. WooHoo. Also, it seems that 'Be Yourself Day' is gonna be pretty fun! Oh and Thank God Hairin's bringing the fabric paint for the T-shirt coz I sure as hell am not hunting for it!       Secondly, Amath sucked today! That new teacher - Mr Alvin Lim, he so needs to improve. He's nice and all but I seriously am gonna fail if he continues this way! Oh and there's an Amath Class Test on week 10! SUCKS BIG TIME. Oh at least that wasn't too bad. I think I CAN manage.      Okay... for the thing that PISSED ME OFF BIG TIME. Geezz, I'm pissed, embarrassed, mad and definitely NOT feeling too happy about this. Teacher's day is coming up and the Sec 3s have to put up something. My class, being the freakin enthusiats that we are, are all pumped up. We have this presedential elections idea, not a bad one actually. The thing is that, I was previously TOLD to go up as Mr Clarence Lim's supporter. The thing was that I didn't want to and so I said so thinking that was the end.    Then today, during SS/Geog lesson, which happened to be a free period, was used as a rehearsal. Our first actually. Zahra came went out calling everyone, and guess what, my freakin name was called. I was like WHAT THE HECK?! Okay, so I decided to try to do it, but I was throughly upset. I know this may not seem like anything big to many, but I'm totally without confidence. I think I get stage fright and I'm not up for embarrassing myself. Plus, the damn speech was so LAME. Sucking Up much! GEEZ...   Anyhow, by the end of the day, I was obviously upset & I was certainly whining. I went up to the assholes who had no consideration whatsoever to have asked me, and told 'em that I DIDN"T WANT TO DO IT. Thankfully for Shaniszah, who sorta saved my butt here, was willing to take up the post for me. Woohoo. I owe her a bar of chocolate, which i totally don't mind getting for her! Oh and Zahra was pissed. LIKE I GIVE A DAMN. venting helps... to a certain extent.       Anyways, I'm currently busy downloading, or at least looking to download a couple of George Michael's numbers. Thought he was AMAZING, don't mind the pun, on Oprah's Primetime last night. Loved his songs and fell so in love with father figure. Too bad he's gay, he's pretty hot. Wish him well anyway. Hope I find good ones. I know I like a couple just don't know the titles. sigh... gonna be a chore.       I'm procrastinating again. Homework and all... let's see : Malay, Amath, Geog!!! Will do 'em later, at least Geog and part of Malay. Throughly busy now.       -Later Dayz-       that's all you wanted     something special, someone sacred-     in your lifejust for one moment     to be warm and naked     at my side          sometimes I think that you'll never     understand me     but something tells me together     we'd be happy

           [music : Father Figure, George Michael]   [mood : lethargic, 'stressed' & confused]      I know I know... George Michael again. Can't help it, it's addictive! Really, really LOVE this track. Anyhow, wasted my time last evening lookin for his songs. Didn't manage to find those that I like. Maybe I was mistakened. Oh well...;(      Anyhow, spent the whole of today, after I did my Amath homework that is, which I managed to do ALL : GO-ME, ahem, helping my sister with her IPW project. Sad to say but she's seriously HOPELESS. Together with her friends that is. I'm probably REALLY nice you must think. Coz even despite her pestering me to use the computer all the time, there I was spending hours doing something I had ABSOLUTELY no mood for! I do enjoy doing such things, it was just that I wasn't in the mood. I think it was passable though.       Learning Journeys tommorrow irritating me! Track-pants sucks... & all of us have to wear 'em. And PE T-shirt as well. GROSS!! Anyhow... I'm wearing denims so not too bad!! To hell to those who aren't too happy with that. I hope it'll all be fun. I'm doin it with 3Z, not with 3S... sad. :( suck it up, i know.       Too tired for anything else...       -G'night-       sometimes I think that you'll never     understand me     but something tells me together     we'd be happy          (baby)     I will be your father figure     (oh baby)     put your tiny hand in mine     (I'd love to)     I will be you preacher teacher     (    be your daddy)     anything you have in mind     (it would make me)     I will be you father figure     (very happy)     I have had enough of crime     (please let me)     I will be the one who loves you-     until the end of time

           [music : Careless Whispers, George Michael]   [mood : whatever]      Most importantly, I would like to make a change in opinion. My new temporary Amath teacher isn't too bad. He's great actually. We're actually doing work, and I'm pretty sure I'm heading somewhere. I actually comprende.       We had to design our T-shirt today during CE period, according to careers we think we will be in, 10 years in the future. I chose a career in the film industry, as a Director! Yeah right!! As if I'd actually stand a chance. I wouldn't mind it, just that it isn't my top priority, although I must admit, I had considered it seriously at one point in my life. Then again, I had considered evrything from a doctor, lawyer, teacher, psychologist, psychiatrist, CIA/FBI agent, astronaut and now, a director. Boy oh boy... I'm pretty sure I left out a couple.       Anyhow, not too sure what exactly I plan to do with my t-shirt. Tough job it is as a fashion designer... That's DEFINITELY something I will NOT consider. Nuh uh... NOT for me!       And our fieldtrip to Kampung Glam/Sultan Mosque was a bore! Although I must say I certainly did learn some. But, still boring. Too dry. And all we did was visit Masjid Sultan, no Glam. It was closed for rebuilding.       Oh, and Aisha and I went from the mosque, to glam, and back to the mosque, because 3Z left without us and we thought they were there, when all along they were freakin next to the mosque, in the auditorium!! Silly much.       Egg & Hairin didn't come... so no toblerone!! ;( Tommorrow hopefully.       Anyhow, off to look for inspiration for my t-shirt.       -Peace Out-       I'm never gonna dance again     Guilty feet have got no rhythm     Though it's easy to pretend     I know you're not a fool     I should have known better than to cheat a friend     And waste a chance that i've been given     So i'm never gonna dance again     The way i danced with you

       [music : Cup of Life, Ricky Martin]   [mood : almost giving up]      Went to SpotLight after school to get fabric paint. Bought four colours... erm, some sorta red, cream, black and purple. They looked pretty good, or so I thought. Well, maybe they're nice... just the way I did my shirt... a little messy! Well actually, ALOT messy!! Sheesh... looks like it's been done by a 7 yr old. Anyhow, I've ALMOST finished... just the sleeves left! I'll probably do them at night, before The Apprentice... coz I've got to wait for the front and back to dry completely.       Oh for the Apprentice, I sure as hell hope that Omarosa get booted out. She's just plain annoying!! It's an amazement she's lasted this long. Well, maybe not since she's got Troy in the team, and he's the reason why they don't go to the board room!      Oh and Latifah wants us to go out after Cross-country, next Friday. Should I? I don't think one of 'em really likes me... as in one of 'em if I actually go out with Latifah and gang. I don't feel comfortable around her... at ALL! Geez, come to think of ut, I don't think I like her much either. Oh well. Anyhows, I don't think I'll go with them. Wanna watch 13 Going on 30 and The Bourne Supremacy. Movie Marathon... Gonna be FUN! Go with my sister I guess.. Yeah. I'm so not looking foward to it... Oh & I'll probably walk with Latifah. Walk the whole way.. pretty fun huh?      Anyhow, gotta study Geog...      -happy studin' i guess-       The cup of life     This is the one     Now is the time     Don't ever stop     Push it along     Gotta be strong     Push it along     Right to the top

           [music : If I'm not the one, Nsync]   [mood : happy. great actually]      Well, maybe not. Jeez, way to spoil it all! I know that we're supposed to help in the chores and all, but hey, I'm on the computer here, doin somethin extremely important. Well, at least it's important to me!! There's absoulutely nothing wrong with that. Stop bugging me already.       Anyhow, my tests are over for this week! Woohoo. Well actually that's a given since it's Friday. :P. BUT, i've got Biology & Emath tests next tuesday... sigh. Mr Lim said that the test's tough. MUST STUDY tomorrow, after my homework &amp; on Sunday!!       Hairin & Ifah wants me to go along to watch Stepford Wives, didn't want to. Then Ifah just HAD to go send me the trailer, and well, interest has been sparked. Not going though, to risque to spend $8.50 on a 2star movie...  I'll ask 'em how it was, then maybe on Friday I'll watch. Yups, that's what i'll do!!       Anyhow, Ifah said some sweet stuff today, or maybe not. She thinks I'm cynical thats why she likes me. I'm not fake. Am I really cynical? It's suppose to be a not so nice thing, so should I take it as a compliment?!? Oh well, perhaps I am. Why deny it. It's not to bad actually, at least I'm honest, sincere and NOT FAKE.       Oh well, nothing much happened today, at least I can't remember much. I love the song by the way!!       -See Ya s  -          I'm staring at your picture every night      The scent of you still lingers in my mind      I wonder if you're alone and feel alright      And the sun has come out of the clouds           And sometimes when I listen to our song      The night seems so cold and far too long      I wanna call you up cause in the end      I keep writing letters to my garbage can           Lately, feels like I'm going crazy      And baby, come and lay down beside me

       [music : Back at one, Brian McKnight]   [mood : Impressed, Speechless]      I read this just a few minutes ago... and WOW. Deep stuff and really logical. Just WOW       People on the Internet always amaze me.           People in general always amaze me.Overall, NSYNC fans NEVER fail to amaze me.           When I say that, I mean in intelligence, care, friendship, wonderfulness, and...     in their downright naivety and ignorance.          I'm not calling anyone stupid, but I will call some people blind. Of the people I come in contact with on the Internet, 90% of them are NSYNC fans. Ok, I'll chalk that up to an overwhelming 99.9%. I'm a people watcher, both on and off of the Internet. There's a lot to be learned by how people speak and act when you're not completely engaged in what they're doing or saying. It gives you time to see what their opinions are, what their beliefs are, and how they have been manipulated by thoughts or practices that aren't really their own, but they have accepted as "truth" in their world.          Oh I'm definitely an NSYNC fan. There's no doubt about that. I would never insult anyone's intelligence by saying that they don't interest me or turn me on quite a bit...but there's a difference between being a fan, and being a rabid card carrying fan club nazi. There's a big difference between supporting them, and having them become every part of your existence, including the points you make in arguments. (stupid or not)          I visit many NSYNC boards, I have a board of my own, and I also get enough emails to keep any good fan club staff in business for a LONG time. But overall, I don't see these as fan adorations or even "contact" letters towards me. I see them as opportunities to see what people are like out there. Now that I have a journal that people respond to, I get to people watch even more.          Some people call me psychic, some of my close friends wonder if I have a sixth sense, but in all honesty...my skills are honed and perfected by watching. Watching watching watching wherever I go.          So it stuns and amuses me when I travel around the Internet and see what people write or express with their names attached to it. It stuns and BEMUSES me what people will throw out as their "opinion" or the "backing up" of their opinion. When in all reality, it only makes other people's arguments sound that more intelligent.          I'm in my mid-twenties. I've been through college. I've lived more life than most of my readers out there, or NSYNC fans in general. My opinions are set, yet they are open to new views and new interpretations. I don't look at the age of the speaker, I look at the message. If the message is worthy of my investigation or ponderment, then I pay even closer attention. But there are a few things that need to be said in regard to that.          Now that I've said that my opinions are set, I'd like to clarify that. What that means (in regard to NSYNC, other bands, etc) is that I'm not easily swayed or influenced by rumors or argument trends. You know what I'm talking about. The same old debates that float around endlessly. The debates over Britney and Justin, the debates over OTown, the debates over Lance or JC being gay, and so on, and so forth.          Here's the core of my argument:     I made a statement in my last entry that I was listening to OTown at the time. I also put the quote that it was scary that I was actually listening to it. Immediately there was a response of anger and insult that I would dare hint to the fact that OTown isn't worthy of listening to.           I never said that. But I will say it now. OTown...is not...a group...I think...is good. But that's not the debate here. The debate is the REASONS, the ASSUMED reasons why this person thinks that I don't like OTown as a band.          Because of a dislike that NSYNC once had for them, or still continues to have.          I know that a lot of people out there are greatly influenced by their idols. If Justin eats popcorn, that is now their favorite food. If JC hates BBQ, then they will never touch BBQ again because JC MUST know what he's talking about. Maybe it's even a small tribute to the man every time you sit at a BBQ restaurant with your friends and casually sip on water instead of partaking in the festival of food.           But all it's really proving is that you have no mind of your own.          I have a mind, a damn good one, and I'm not going to let people I RESPECT dictate what I do, think, eat, say or live my life. Why on earth would I allow a pop-group full of men who wouldn't alter their lifestyles for me, tell me what I should do, think, say, eat, or how I should act?          I don't like OTown. It has nothing to do with them being with Lou Pearlman, with them being disliked by NSYNC at one time (or currently), with them being jackasses, with them being great guys, with them being anything other than mediocre pop-artists IN MY MIND. Am I saying that everyone should believe that way? Nope. I can understand why people love them and love their music. However, it's just not for me. I have my reasons, they're tried and true, and they work for me and my life. But what sadness it is that people believe that humans in general are so stupid and ignorant that they would pass up the opportunity for a band to be part of their entertainment enjoyment, just because another band dislikes them? This is like saying that I hate all brunettes because my mom doesn't like brunettes. It would be a mindless practice, and one that shows immaturity and the lack of a backbone.          The other debate I see all around the Internet, is about Britney Spears. Can I roll my eyes now? I don't think I can roll them enough.          Is she a role model? Is she too sexy? Is she a slut? Is she sleeping with Justin? Is she cheating on Justin? Is she a bitch? Does she sing live? Is she a studio creation? Is she using Justin? And on, and on, AND ON.           What's the famous retort that Britney supporters give? "You're jealous" OR "You just hate her because she's dating Justin."          Are we seeing the stupidity here yet? Are we seeing the fact that those people who throw those two excuses around, are really doing nothing but making themselves seem even DUMBER than the ones who can't initially back up their opinions? Not everyone has to like everyone else. If Britney is your queen, you go! I think it's great that you've found someone that you look up to, admire, and enjoy. But that doesn't make other people wrong when they find her faults. That doesn't mean that you liking her, is the way it SHOULD be. Why do the supporters find the need to convert those who dislike? Does Britney need a posse of supporters who recruit people in like old people to an Amway convention?          But the number one thing I'm saying here...just because you dislike, doesn't mean you're jealous or angry over her relationship with Justin.          I don't like Britney Spears. In fact, I dislike her so much that I'm numb to her. She doesn't bring joy to my life or bring disappointment and anger. She's just not there. I'm not going to go into the reasons why I think she's the biggest waste of space that Jive ever signed, because that's nobody's business but mine. However, at the same time, I DO understand why people like her. And I'm cool with it. If you want to love her, then love her. I'm not going to shove my distaste for her into your face, don't shove your admiration into mine.           But at this point I can see the anger already. I see the fingers that are just itching to say "Lyn, you only hate her because she's with Justin." OR "You only hate her because you're jealous." I don't have to be envious or jealous of someone to dislike them. I don't have to yearn to BE like someone, in order to not like what they're doing. I don't like her, I have my reasons, she's not my thing, and that's that. I will not be converted, nor will I stand for someone TRYING to convert me. It's an insult to my intelligence, and it only solidifies in my mind (when someone tries with these stupid reasons for adoration) why I dislike her to begin with.          I guess the gist of what I'm saying here is...if you're going to argue or debate, come up with original material. Come up with things that make you sound somewhat intelligent or would push people to see your side. And for goodness sakes, be open-minded! RESPECT the fact that not everyone can be into what you're into. Not everyone loves Justin's smile, or Chris' sense of humor, or Britney's hair. Not everyone loves songs about wet dreams or dream of Ashley Angel.           And you know what? That's ok!          Walk away with the attitude of...."They don't know what they're missing."         I just love this entry. Deep, really deep. Really cool person. I'm seriously speechless. This lady here could very well be my role model... inspiration.       -Speechless-       One...your like a dream come true...     Two... jus wanna be with you...     Three... girl its plain to see...that your the only one for me...     Four...repeat steps one to three...     Five... make you fall in love with me...     If ever I believe our work is done....then I start Back at One.

       [music : I could be the one, Stacie Orrico]   [mood : estatic]      Yippee! LIVERPOOL WON! So happy. The game was awesome, especially the 2nd half. What a rollercoaster. Man, I thought we were screwed when that damn Anelka scored the 1st goal. I never liked him though! What a loser... He never did much for Liverpool and there he goes being the "hero" of Man City. And I hadn't realised that they had sold Diouf to Bolton. At least I knew Owen was gone.    Okay stupid thing to say.. I mean who didn't know right? Anyhows, good game... Gotta love Steven.G. Oh, I didn't fancy how Kewell played this game. He was SLOW.       I saw my school on the New Paper again yesterday. It was regarding Be Yourself Day. Sec 1,2 and 4 were mentioned. WHERE are the Sec Threes? Harlooo... Pretty cool though, especially since we've been showcased twice in a month. Ahem... was about to type somethin... not nice. Better watch my fingers. Wouldn't want the principal to mention somethin bad during morning assembly again.       Did I mention Be Yourself Day? No i don't think so. I chose to be a director, focusing on shooting music videos. That'd be really fun! Plus, I'm quite sure I've got great ideas for them. I wasn't the only director in class though. Thre were two others... extras. Hated the process of having to design our own T-shirts. Bloody freakin waste of time. Seriously. Could have studied more Geography on thursday instead of designing the damn tshirt. Oh well, it's over anyway.       Have biology test next tuesday and I need to study!! Really tough, or so Mr Lim said. (have i mentioned this before? Sounds awfully familiar) Anyhow, will start studin after I log off. Hurray for me coz I completed all my homework for the weekend!! Oh and I think there's Emath test on circles on Tuesday as well... need to remember the formulas.       Okay not too bad this weekend, so far... productive!       There's cross-country on Friday. Watchin movies after that. So far, plan is to watch The Bourne Supremacy, Stepford Wives and 13 Going On 30. Too ambitious my cousin says... so how? I'll confide in others and see what they say...      Oh well... Gonna spent more time online, once I'm done, I'll wait a while before studin Biology. Good plan rite?      -Cheers-       Doesn't matter where I'm from, where I am, how far I've come,       Doesn't matter where I live, what I have,   You want my life      Doesn't matter who I've known, what I've done, take it all     You want me as I am          I could be the one     What are you looking for?     I don't have much to give     Lord I'm ready     And through You     I could be the one     I could have hope renewed     I would hold onto what You think of me and I could be the one
