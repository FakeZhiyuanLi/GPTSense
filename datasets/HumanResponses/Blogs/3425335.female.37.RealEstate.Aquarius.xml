      Welcome to the flagship blogging madness of "Three Girls Grown Up".  We are three "former college girls" who have been friends for... eons, I guess.  We made it through school (well some of us did, some of us are STILL IN SCHOOL) and are navigating/fumbling our way through life as adults.  We miss the days of sitting around curled up on the couch babbling until all ours, hands cupped around hot tea, cocoa or whatever.  Long days sitting in the porch swing, road trips, truth-or-dare, just being together and basically just BEING.  This is our way of doing that despite being scattered to the four winds.  Thanks for joining us!

      Those five years were fabulous.  I love the learning experience (miss it immensely!) and the good company.  Majoring in art was incredibly difficult.  I am artistic, but not a natural drawing/painting talent.  It was frustrating to sit next to people who could put a single line on paper and it looked like art.  I agonized over every line and stroke.  I didn't know what I was doing and even though I waited four years to go to college I still didn't know what I should be doing.  And actually, I'm not entirely sure I know now.  Love was in my blood in college.  Falling "in love" with the fellas, with the books, with learning, with art.  Loving life and the thought of the world being open to me.  Very heady stuff.  In some ways those years were also agonizing, having self-doubt, wanting to change majors sometimes, the stress of the workload and working to support myself.  Horrible professors at times.  The boring classes that had nothing to do with anything I wanted to do.  Depression at not being as good as I thought I could be.  I applied for the specialized degree program and was accepted after my work was juried by the professors in my department.  There were three of us that applied at the same time.  Two made it.  I overheard the last girl being rejected and felt horrible and relieved at the same time.  The acceptance created an additional year for me to stay in school.  I never felt like an artist, though, and worried that someone would discover I was not.  After going through some delightful boys and some not-so-delightful boys I settled on one, graduated and went to work as a designer for a gift company.  I designed stationery and apparel for a couple of years then had a brief break with reality at which time I decided to break all my ties and run away to California.  There I worked with computers doing freelance researching, writing, web design, project managing.  Basically a mercenery brain-for-hire.  I loved those years as well despite the hard knocks I got for it.  I remember telling someone (probably Shannon) before I left that it might be a mistake but I was doing it anyway because it would turn out okay in the long run.  I do that a lot.  For a very long time I was involved with someone defective and brilliant who is an excellent example of walking that fine line between genius and insanity.  Depending on how well you know him is where you think he is on that line.  The more I knew him the farther he seemed to stray over into the foggy shadows of craziness.  And we'll leave it at that (and hope everyone else leaves it at that too).  But the California years were more GOOD than bad and, again, an invaluable learning experience.  With that came self-sufficiency, a love for self-employment, discovering so many strengths I didn't know I had.  I'm psyched to run my own business and be good at it.  California is a beautiful state and I'm so fortunate to have my time there.  I met my husband there and we married after knowing each other a couple of years and finally after his stressful job became too much and we got tired of the high cost of living out there (and the rolling blackouts), we thought how cool it would be to play frontier family and move back to my home state of Arkansas.  We're in the process of taking over the family business here.  For half of what we were paying in California, we can afford to own a home AND six acres of lakefront property where we plan to build eventually.  But it's a strange, circuitous route from starting here, going there, having all these different jobs, coming back here and ending up in real estate which is something I never had a desire to do.  Oddly enough I found out I'm good at it, so it turned out just fine.  AND, we have little munchkin added to the family, a sweet angel boy that couldn't be more perfect if I'd sat down and made a wishlist to have him created from scratch.  Someone joked about how he needed a sister and I thought... there's no way I can top that.  No way in the world.  I think it was probably my junior year in college Ginny gave me a copy of the Tao te Ching, a very good translation by Stephen Mitchell (which I still have, Ginny).  I was tense and controlling and making not only myself miserable but probably everyone around me feel pretty much the same way.  The best message I got out of that book was about letting go.  When I let go and stopped trying to make things always be exactly as I thought they should... those were the moments when things worked the absolute best way they could.  It was like magic.  I don't understand the how or why of it, but it's one of the best lessons I learned.  So, I try not to fret excessively.  It's like natural prozac or something -- free, and it also doesn't mess up your health insurance coverage.  This morning my mom asked me how I was going to manage my next big hurdle, and I told her I wasn't sure, but I'd figure it out along the way.  She said, "You just jump in and then make it work out, don't you?"  And I said yes.  And she said, "That's what I always did."  (So, insanity really is inherited.)

      After traipsing the world as the daughter of a Foreign Service officer, I was superficially planted along with my parents and two siblings in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Not sure what I wanted to do – try my hand at becoming the next super model, break into the Ivy League set at Princeton or pretty much nothing, I opted for the later and enrolled in the university in town. My parents lived three minutes from campus, but we all agreed I needed the freedom which living in a dorm afforded. (Now, I know they just wanted me out of the house!)  I had one heck of a first year – made a 4.0, fell in love and rebelled in ways I never imagined. It was my second year of school that I met Ginny and Wendy, though I have no recollection of how we began or even transformed into these parts of a whole. It seems we have always been… drawn by our differences, tied by our common core.   I think it was my ever-present longing for things beautiful and rare that shone light on the loveliness of Ginny and Wendy:  Ginny with her masses of dark curls and the naturally rosiest lips I’ve ever seen. Eyes of curiosity and a mind that reaches beyond my imagination to distant times in the past and future. Goofy and comfortable in her skin. Natural and adventuresome. Accepting and versatile. Laughter.  Wendy, a woman from another time, who I’m quite sure was the object of life-changing affection from a medieval knight of the roundtable. Disarming tiger eyes and orange-roped hair. All curves and softness of a Titian masterpiece, and strength and courage of a frontier maiden. Amazing diverse talent and vision. Headstrong and elitist, but unwaveringly loyal.  I’ve always thought them simply wonderful and considered myself the lucky one in the group.   Ginny was so committed to her study, I relished the opportunity to barge in to her room and keep her from being so productive, plus she had a computer and also a refrigerator that was always stocked with cold Diet Coke. Pink Floyd and Indigo Girls in the background, we spent a lot of time curled on the beds wondering about life and decisions along the way. She particularly hated that I would put my feet on her pillow…  There was one moment, so inconsequential that has stayed in my mind. Ginny’s parents had come in for some event. We were on the elevator going up to our floor. Ginny was in a dress – gasp – and looked the most uncomfortable I’ve ever seen anyone look. It irritated me so to see her like that – the ease and comfort I found in her grounded-ness was gone and I hated it.  Saturday mornings, Wendy was like a siren calling from the ocean. I would wake up to her singing and the haunting strains of the hammered dulcimer. I loved to float down the hall and watch her. Even amid piles of clothes and yesterday’s school papers layering the floor, she transformed the air into a misty hillside in Ireland.  There are so many memories of vibrant living during that time –we were so tentative, but hopeful, believing in each other so much more than in ourselves. We have been changed much by life since then, but still have that same love for each other… the kind that lasts forever.

      All beginnings are hard and so it was with beginning undergarduate at the University of Arkansas in 1988, with the fire drills, sharing bathrooms, the cafeteria, and the nutty social dynamics of dorm life. I was a physics major and thought I knew what I wanted and where I was going. Boy did things turn out different than I had planned. I am from Texas but both my parents had grown up in Arkansas and Missouri and I had relatives spattered all around Fayetteville. It was a grand time, full of new experiences, new discoveries, many epiphanies, and lasting friendships.   The unfettered coyotes: I met Wendy during one of the countless fire drills and we became fast friends, sharing many wonderful conversations. I have a poor poor memory, but the memories I have of Wendy include riding around in her beat up old green gas guzzling car and the time when we saw a very sweet little bird sitting near her car as we were parking one day and how she said, "Awe, how cute" then turned to me and said "let's kill it!". . . I remember her long red hair, her dulcimer, and her beautiful singing voice and how she hated for me to sing to the Fine Young Cannibals. Shannon I encountered a bit later. She was (still is) an ornery spirit, chocked full of energy, and always planning some fun adventure. The times with her I remember include a trip to the park in the back of a pickup flaunting a condom for no apparent reason and grinning mischievously. I also remember how every single male followed her with their eyes at every restaurant the three of us went to . . . and not more than once, having our conversation interrupted by the advances of one of those young men, only to be turned down by our lovely girl as Wendy and I rolled our eyes at one another. The three of us spent a good deal of time sitting around in one of our rooms (usually mine since it was the neatest, to my surprise!) where we would talk and laugh and enjoy our days together.  My trajectory: I spent two years in the physics program at the University of Arkansas. I more enjoyed my history classes and playing the violin in the orchestra than physics (and all that damn math). I had decided to transfer from the U of A when 30 scientists, including several physicists, left due to lack of funding. It took just a few months after my transfer was in motion for me to realize just how much physics and I were not compatible. For one thing, I wanted to be out of doors and physicists spend a lot of time in doors. In fact, I was sitting in a lab, learning about AC and DC current staring out the window when it dawned on me that I would forever be in such surroundings. After I transferred to Texas Tech University, I spent another three years in school, changing my major to a double in History and Philosphy (I love Philosophy) until I discovered, at the end of my fourth year, that I wanted to be an archaeologist. I dropped philosophy and graduated with my History degree with a minor in Anthropology, Philosphy and Math. I spent the rest of my years until now in Archaeology, three years working in the field and eight years in graduate school.

      Well, like the prow of a ship, I guess I will part these waters.  It was my hope that our extrovert, Shannon, would start, but it looks like destiny has something else in mind.  I will relate my part of the tale as accurately as I can, but bear in mind it comes through the Wendy-filter and who knows what kind of bizarre skewed mess that makes of reality.  The story begins around 1988, about four years after I had graduated from high school.  I was a late college bloomer and had spent some time working before I figured out what I really wanted to do.  First generation college student.  Secondary education was not a high priority in my family.  I decided to major in art (sort of silly in retrospect) and proceeded to enroll at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville.  I had no idea what I was doing, where I was going, didn't get the whole college thing since I didn't even have any friends who had been to college.  I thought it would be easiest to just move into the dorm, although I felt sort of stupid since I was older than most of the Froshes around me.  Reid Hall is where I met "the girls", met them independently from one another.  Ginny I met during a fire drill.  She and I lived on the same floor.  We're all sitting out on the grass waiting for the okay to go back in and I'm standing around like a goober feeling really out of place.  I hadn't been living there very long -- couple days maybe? I saw Ginny sitting on the grass and I knew I couldn't bear just standing there by myself anymore since most everyone was talking to someone.  She was sitting with a group of people and she looked very non-intimidating.  She looked least likely to think I was an alien.  (Little did I realize then what a weirdo she actually was.)  She and I were friends first.  Shannon came later, although she was always there, like the air, like the mist, like clouds in the sky.  We all lived on the 8th floor, all women, all single rooms, no roomies!  I had a corner room, Shannon's room a few doors down from mine, Ginny's was on the other side of the hall, about halfway between us.  Shan was the white-haired girl that everyone knew by sight, but nobody "knew".  She carried a shoulder strap purse that bounced on her hip when she did her "model walk".  (She's going to hate this post, I'm sure.  Oh well.)  She and I had an art class together and before we were friends she used to aggravate me because she always came to class late because she was too busy stopping at the student union to get frozen yogurt.  She'd do her projects the night before they were due and fling them together and get an "A".  I agonized over mine for a billion years and was lucky if I got much better than average.  I was filled with bitterness over it all!  At the time she seemed SO not my type of pal, but eventually we became such close friends.  I don't even remember how.  What a fabulous life we had together.  So many years of memories and wonderment.  I'm not even sure I can properly express how valuable that time was to me.  We lasted a few years until Ginny was the first to leave.  She transferred to Texas Tech against our protests.  And then... I can't remember who left next -- I think Shannon graduated before I did and went on her way.  My degree took five years because I was in a specialized program.  I started college so petrified, feeling really out of place.  I came out of it wiser, more courageous, calm, eager to learn, open-minded, free.  I discovered falling in love and falling out of love. I experienced the hard knocks of living in the world on my own (horrible little things like small claims court, burglared cars, oil burning vehicles, stalkers, creepy dates and learning to keep house).  And I was lucky enough to do it all with those two girls at my side -- sometimes keeping me out of trouble, but actually more often than not, getting me into trouble.  (To be fair, it was mostly just Shannon.  Ginny was a very good girl!)  The years that followed got proceedingly stranger and stranger as life progressed and where I am now is where I never thought I would be.  But isn't that the way it is for most people?  And certainly tales for another day, after the girls have shared their versions of The Beginning.

      The three years at Texas Tech were a tumultuous time. Whereas I had previously been very sure that I wanted to be a physicist, I suddenly discovered it did not appeal to me and I was unsure about my future. I double majored in history and philosophy and loved both fields. I took wonderful history classes in European and American history – developing a love for Native American and Environmental history, but thoroughly enjoying my classes in the Protestant Reformation and Women in European History and the history of Science. Philosophy was equally thrilling and exposed me to ethics, aesthetics and logic. I was riled up by many a discussion and thought I would write a book  about ethics and morals. I learned a lot about writing in history and philosophy (especially from one eccentric philosopher who commented sternly in my papers).   At the end of my fourth year, I took a Prehistory of Texas (archaeology) class. Extra credit for this class included an opportunity to go to Seminole Canyon state park and record rock art. The people who had gathered to record the rock art were members of the Texas Archaeological Society and came from a variety of backgrounds and were primarily in their 70s and full of life. We photographed and sketched the rock art on the canyon walls surrounded by the beautiful Transpecos desert landscape which was in full bloom. The joy effervescing from the people, the rock art whispering of prehistoric beliefs and lifeways, and the tremendous beauty of the desert overwhelmed me and I knew archaeology was for me. I went out on every possible volunteer opportunity to record rock art and excavate. That summer, I attended the Texas Tech Archaeological field school in San Saba county. I learned the basics of survey and excavation as well as how to maintain a field camp. Later that summer, I worked in Austin on the Burned Rock Midden Project, a lab job where I learned a good deal about artifacts and procedures. I graduated in May and immediately began my journey into the world of professional archaeology.  After I graduated, I immediately went to work for Texas Parks and Wildlife in Austin in their archaeology lab. I worked mostly with historic materials (lots of metal and glass) and found love and heartbreak in Austin. Only half a year later, I was hired for an excavation in Northeast Texas. The site turned out to be one of the largest Caddoan village sites ever found. That excavation took a year of my life, living in Longview, Texas. I made a number of friends, played a lot of pool, sung a little karoke, and learned a tremendous amount about excavating the stains left by the posts of Caddo houses and troweling very hard baked red clay. This Caddoan village site, the Oak Hill Village site, was located on Texas Utility Mining Company (TUMCO) property. It was originally thought to be a small site with a midden (trash dump) and not a significant site. It turned out to have over 40 structures and ended up costing TUMCO a lot more than they had planned . . . upon learning this, TUMCO unceremoniously told us to quit digging, pack up, and leave. Under Federal laws, TUMCO is required to assess the cultural resources on its property and to mitigate (dig) sites of any significance or to leave them undisturbed. With the ballooning costs of the excavation, TUMCO suddenly thought it would be better to fence the site off and leave it unexcavated. This was a knee-jerk reaction and about three months later they brought us back out to finish the excavation since the cost they had already put in would be paid for by the lignite coal they could extract.   But in those three months (in the heart of summer) I went to Kickapoo Caverns State Park in West Texas. This was a survey of all the parks property. It was rugged, rocky, hilly, and all the vegetation had thorns and claws. There were snakes and scorpions and ticks. We lived in a bunk house on the park and were surrounded by all sorts of insect life (like the kissing bug which carries a frightening parastite called e. cruzii). We also were surrounded by some extraordinarily colorful birds, vermillion fly catchers, painted buntings, vireos, hummingbirds, red and zone tailed hawks, vultures and more. We found caves with Mexican freetail bats who left en masse at dusk. We found the debris from making stone tools on the tops of ridges where the one could get a good look at the land and, at the confluences of rivers, we found large mounds of burned rock where people in the past had cooked up various plants and animals. We also found the heat scorching and did our best to get a days work in before noon. It was a very hard but very rewarding environment. Following that, I went back up to finish the Caddoan site—another 4 months or so of mapping post stains encircling hearths with 16-row corn.

      This morning I was thinking about how weird it is to come back home after being away so long.  We have been back a little more than two years and still it's surreal at times.  A friend of mine from school runs the daycare where I take my son.  An old neighbor and pal of mine is doing subcontracting work for me and is going to start working in our office as an agent.  A friend/mentor of mine picked up our friendship where it left off more than 15 years ago as if time hadn't passed at all.  It's strange, but nice.  Surreal, yet comforting.  Coming home is good.  I fretted about the fork in the road and who knows how it would have turned out had I gone the other way, but once we made the decision, the other road ceased to matter.  The possibilities seemed trite and meaningless.  (Or the shorter version of that is "who cares, anyway.")  It's so good to love where you are.

      It could be that she’s so easy-going and accepting. Or, it could be that I’m just plain ornery. Either way, I used to find myself pushing the limits of Ginny’s patience time and time again. What a glorious friend to laugh off my playful attempts at irritation.   Diet Coke in a Can   I was sitting atop Ginny’s narrow bed sipping a diet coke one late winter afternoon. Plain old diet coke – before the days of caffeine free and vanilla and lime flavoring! Two huge pane glass windows overlooked a stretch of grass soggy from the melting snow. Naked yet hopeful trees lined a winding creek which was nothing more than run-off from the parking lot adjacent to the dorm. The cloud-less sky was beckoning blue, and I was antsy to go somewhere.   Wendy and Ginny were involved in something rather important, or so it seemed because they wouldn’t respond to my wanderlust pleading. There were books open and papers spread across the desk. There was music; there always was.   I began tapping my coke can against the wide window sill, first in rhythm with the music and then annoyingly out of sync. The details of what followed are not clear. Ginny probably has an accurate description! I do remember that I was driving everyone nuts including myself, but I refused to stop until Ginny begged me to stop (I think…). For some reason, Ginny wouldn’t lower herself to beg and so I continued. (I realize that there is absolutely no deeply insightful reason for this story. It is just one of those memories that cause me to belly laugh and long for the simple hours.)  At some point Wendy left the room. As with so many of my endeavors, I became bored with my own game and stopped the tapping. When Wendy returned, I switched strategies for a win and claimed that Ginny had pleaded for me to stop.   “Tell Wendy the truth,” Ginny kept saying over and over. I didn’t admit it then, but now the truth is out.

      I’m so afraid of losing memories. Memories of carefree, intense, passionate youth. It’s happening – old memories replaced by newer ones. Heaviness of life covering over the hopefulness. Reality sinking dreams of the awestruck heart. And I want to grab on, railing against the loss. I want to live again through these memories. And all I can do is want, because time doesn’t wait.  Running the tunnels of my mind seems to be a constant past-time. Images pop into view, a bit hazy like old photos. I touch them gingerly and move on, hoping I’ll be able to find my way back somehow.   A Wendy Moment–    I had done something terrible to someone I loved madly. So deep was the hurt in both of us – he crept away and I was left with dramatic physical and emotional effects of what I’d done. My shoulders and neck burned with tension. My throat was so constricted that I was unable to swallow food. I woke up repeatedly in the night, choking for breath, my heart beating irregularly. My eyes, darkened by grief and lack of sleep, were heavy and dull. There was no one I trusted to share this burden with – until Wendy.   I was sitting on the lower-level steps of the university’s student union, waiting by the series of glass doors leading to the bus stop. Wendy slipped up behind me and sat down. I don’t remember her saying anything. She just looked at me. Perhaps she touched my arm, and I saw assurance and acceptance in her eyes. I asked, “Can you keep a secret?” She nodded. (And probably made some smart-ass remark! But, I value sarcasm, so I was sold.)   And out it spilled. No tears that I remember. Just a deep sense of relief; no more going it alone. I don’t recall what words of wisdom she shared – though I’m sure she did because Wendy generally likes to tell people what to do, especially me. ;-)   I knew at that moment that we would be holding-fast, loving-boldly friends forever. She is still the tender keeper of my secrets.

      Working in archaeology has served to expose me to a number of amusing, or at least memorable, events. Nothing akin to Indiana Jones’ adventures, but odd. Like the time I went with one of my archaeology professors, Dr. Grant Hall, to see about some human remains a farmer unearthed. Dr. Hall had received a call from a farmer, Ed, who told him he had found three human skulls pretty close together while he was plowing. So, Dr. Hall, three of his graduate students, and myself drove an hour west, off the Caprock and back on it again, to go see three skulls presumably belonging to a Native American burial.  We were expecting the ground to be peppered with fragments of skeletal remains (broken by the plow), or prehaps flakes from making stone arrows and knives and some burned rocks from cooking features--run of the mill archaeological site stuff. And we expected to see three skulls sitting on top of the soil (or maybe on Ed's front porch).  We got out there, met the land owner, Ed,  who was wearing ragged trousers, a baseball cap, and was missing a few teeth, and sporting, quite proudly, a four inch scare across his brow which he later told us was due to a "terrible accident."   Ed recounted the finding of the skulls:   "yep', he said, "I was plowing along with my 17" plow, deeper than I do usually, cuz, see, I wanted to git to some fresh soil, you know, turnin' the field over, and then I saw this white thing roll up and saw the eye sockets. well, that was a bit of a surprise, I tell you what. But I kep' on goin cuz I wasn't real sure it were a skull and I turned around at the end of the field here and plowed back this-a-way, and I git to where I saw the first skull and I turned up another.  Well, now I was really kinda jittered, but I kep on goin' and I took another turn and around the same place, I turned up a third skull.  Well I jist jumped out that tractor and ran and called the Sheriff cuz I didn't know what to think and they asked some questions and told me to call you."    We couldn't see the site from the driveway but it sounded like a burial ground. Exciting stuff. So, we pile into the back of Ed's truck and drive down a dirt rode and drive across the field and stop.  We hop out. Dr. Hall hands us some pin flags and says "Now, don't pick anything up, just mark it."  I had about twenty flags. We start walking out to where the land owner was pointing saying, "it's jist over here."  I am not seeing anything on the ground, but I am not worried because there will at least be the three skulls to indicate a site,  . . .  right? We get over to where landowner Ed, insists he saw the skulls. We look around on the ground, nothing around, no fragments, no skulls.  Dr. Hall asks, "Where are they . . . the skulls?" "Well," says Ed, "they got covered back up as I was plowing. You know," as if we'd been farmers all our lives, "They just turned over with the soil, they can't be too deep under."   Ah! We will have to dig a bit. So Dr. Hall goes back to his car and gets some shovels and a screen and in the mean time he sends us out to mark all the artifacts we can find on the surface of the field around the area. There was absolutely nothing, amazingly nothing, it would be hard to imagine such a lack of material remains. Dr. Hall returns, hands out shovels, arranges us students ever so many meters apart and says to us to "dig a 50 cm square pit, I'll tell you when to quit." I dig and he says to quit at a clay level, about 2 feet deep, with nothing in it. I start digging a new hole . . .and another hole . . .so all us students are are digging, Dr. Hall is digging, we dig ten . . .fifteen . . . thirty pits, all in this one area where Ed is dead certain he saw the skulls. Dr. Hall mutters under his breath about some psychological study of how easily people are mistaken by what they remember and yet are sure they remember exactly what they claim. I'm thinking, great, we're digging in the wrong place.  We dig for about two hours and we're tired and blisters are appearing on our hands then one of the grad students has a "good" idea to use pokey sticks- a long rod with which to find pots-an old looters trick. Ed says, "I have some iron rebar rods that'll do the trick". Dr Hall  replied, "we'd sure appreciate using them."   I'm thinking Dr Hall ought to speak for himself and where the hell is the water and why does the sun have to shine so bright? So Ed brings us a bunch of rods and we poke around in that farmers field for a couple more damn hours and my muscles are hurting, and my hand are blistering in new and improved places, and we are not finding jack and we ought to have a long time ago if anything were there and then I notice ole' Ed, who had finally started helping us an hour before, starts moving down the field about 30 or more yards and starts poking around. Hmmmmm, I think, not so sure about where he saw those skulls anymore. I glance at Dr. Hall, he's gives me a "we're in hell and we can't get up" look.   More poking, poking, poking, praying, praying, praying. Then, I look up and Dr. Hall is over there talking to Ed and Ed goes off to his house and Dr. Hall informs us Ed is going to replow the field. We take a break, drink some sodas.  Dr. Hall says, in his wisened, experienced, story-telling tone of voice, "I've been on some wild goose chases in my time" provides us a dramatic pause and continues "and now ya'll have, too? He cackles. We curse him and all his children. Ed returns with his tractor and he plows and we walk behind looking at the soil as it's turning, trying to spy any damn bones at all. Nothing, an hour of this and nothing. Ed expands the region of interest to encompass a large amount of the field. Nothing. I am walking along, tired from walking and standing, my feet sinking into the soil, so soft, I could sleep here, rest, want to rest.   FINALLY, We give up on the plow and FINALLY, Dr. Hall decides we've done the best we can do and we ought to go home now.  Ed asks, "are ya gonna dig this weekend?"    You could almost hear the students thinking on excuses on why we won't be able to make it, but to our relief Dr. Hall says he doesn't have time.  We get all the equipment rounded up and pile into Dr. Hall's station wagon.  He starts again in his "I remember when" tone, telling us about his worst experiences - the time he tangled with poison ivy and how it covered his arms and legs and "when the rash started down my chest and stomach, I went to the doctor!"  he also said he now knew what he should have asked that farmer before going out to investigate his claim . . . "I should have asked, Ed, are you crazy?"

      I recently asked my first flame if he truly loved me during our years of youthful admiration. In his response and my saturated review, I discovered more about myself than I did about him. There is definitely more to ask, to ponder about love lost than the clear cut, ‘So, did you love me?’ Not only do feelings change, but feelings about feelings change. Our perceptions, our definitions change with time, experience, life.  His description of love through the heart and mind of a 20-year-old was mystical, pristine, exclusive, abstruse, everlasting, inexplicably valuable, a treasure, perfect. And those labels, those feelings still make me flower. But, for him, at the time it wasn’t enough just to be in the moment of rapture that has glazed the eyes of countless young lovers. He could never just let be what was – it had to lead somewhere – the next accomplishment, the next battle, the next victory.   I don’t say this in judgment, but in understanding. I was the same, perhaps still am - though the practical results of this tendency in me are much different. He was action, I was thought. He was head, I was heart. He battles with blazing a trail of success. I suffer from infatuation with the dream of yesterday and the fantasy of tomorrow.   As a young woman, love was new, creative, passionate, aching, endless, pinnacled by nothing. Love is what I lived for…and still do. Love, though defined and felt entirely differently by me now, is still the most important treasure in my life. Relationships –that’s it. Knowing and loving God. Knowing and loving my family. Knowing and loving my friends. Knowing and loving myself.  At a still-young 35, this is what I have learned love is not --  Love is not a feeling. Love is not words. Love is not earned. Love is not jealous. Love is not selfish. Love is not negotiable. Love is not judgmental, but does tell the truth. Love does not give up.  And here is what love is –  Love is the most important aspect of life. Life is nothing without love. Love is self-less. Love is action. Love is enduring. Love is thoughtful and gentle. Love is forgiving. Love is pure. Love is trust. Love is protection. Love is persistent. Love is vulnerable, but the strongest thread of life. Love is life-giving.  Though I had my insecurities in my childish twenties, I was still fairly innocent of my disastrous failings. This made me a lot freer in some ways than I am today. And the possibility of not being loved by someone I loved never entered my mind.  These days, I am periodically haunted with the thoughts that either I am not loveable or I cannot love. Living with either of these options is unbearable to me. How did I come to this dangerous and lonely spot?  I believe we learn to love by being loved. If we grow up in an environment where we are not loved and accepted, it will be nearly impossible for us to accept love from someone else or to love and accept another. How sad that my thinking must say something about what I have learned about love as a child and since…  But, thanks to God, I am not bound by my past, but am a new creation in Christ, my Savior, my Lord.  II Corinthians 5:17  . And Christ has given the greatest testimony to love through His sacrifice and His gift of freedom – our own will to choose Him or not. He chose love. He chose to lay down His life for us. And that is the greatest thing: to chose love, not to be forced, and to know that by choosing you may not receive in return…but choosing anyway.

      There are three great arched plate-glass windows in my office. The credenza that houses my laptop butts against the base of these windows and when I settle in my high-back, Cadet blue leather chair, I can see the top story of a neighboring apartment complex. Behind the charcoal-drawn rooftop, sprout massive, old oak trees so thick with dark leaves they resemble the outline of some distant hills. Heavy clouds roll and shift hiding all but veiled crevices of the lilac sky.  Centered in the frame of the last window, I can see the back patio entrances to two adjacent units. A single staircase leads from the ground level to a central landing. Three more steps up in each opposite direction, railed patios mark the sliding glass door entrances of the two dwellings. Secured at the edge of each railing is an American flag, the kind you wave in patriotic glee at a hometown parade. They silently portray the simple message – united we stand. Identical Wal-Mart white plant baskets heavy with orange-red begonias hang in line behind each flag.   In the apartment on the right lives a woman, probably in her late seventies, slim and perky. She fancies white crop pants, ballet slippers and plaid blouses in pretty pastel shades, though she never tucks them in. Her iron and fleece hair waves away from her face, tucked behind her bare ears. She smiles so much, there must be a secret held in her heart.  A gentleman, a few years her senior, lives next door. Slight but spry, his belted khaki pants are always well-pressed and his starched white cotton short-sleeved shirts secured neatly at the waistband. His tanned face holds a look of distance and longing, but a knowing contentment as well.  My eyes have naturally fallen to this scene again and again over the past few months. I have seen these neighbors sharing tea on the steps, watering plants and sweeping their patios.   Once I found them standing on the steps leading down to the parking lot. With her arms outstretched on opposite rails on the top landing, she looked to him standing square below, his head tilted and hands clasped. As he turned to move down, she pushed her body up, arms stiff with support on the railings. She twirled her feet and tossed one playfully forward as she returned to the ground. It was something a fifteen year old girl, nervous with flirtation, would do and it made my eyes tear with wonder at this life.  Although this privately-viewed show has brought me some amusement, I did not fully realize what they had been sharing with me until today.   I was in a moment of sighing, breathing fully and heavily to relax the tension in my neck and shoulders. These times for me nearly always come with thoughts of my insignificance in terms of the story of the world, and the aching belief that there has to be more to life than this life I’m living.  I opened my eyes and turned my head to see these neighbors in a standing cuddle. Her arms were swaddled between her chest and his. One of his arms held her at the waist, the other across her back to the nape of her neck. They shared a playful, targeted kiss on the mouth, and then she rested her head, nuzzling the place his shirt began its line of buttons.   “Oh,” I breathed, and my hand moved to my mouth in tender admiration.  I have been searching so hard for love, with such urgency that an untruth has been cultivated in my mind about the life of love. Love does not belong alone to the young, those supple in body, uncharted in experience. There is no time-limit on love.  	 Love is about the heart--the heart of a seventy-year-old who only remembers her line-less face of fifteen, but still feels the same school-aged wonder; the heart of man, battered by life, yet soft and open to the mystery it holds.  In  Under the Tuscan Sun , the film based on Frances Mayes' best-selling novel, the namesake heroine was a woman betrayed and worn by love lost, but also healed by love. When she found healing and wholeness, she spoke truth from her experience. “Great things can happen, even late in the game.”  Late in the game, these neighbors, friends, lovers have surprised me with hope and given me whispers of tomorrow--with their youthful fervency and wise appreciation, with the mere moments of their lives glimpsed from a nearby window.

      I'm sitting in the Mexican restaurant and there is a 10 month old little girl who won't stop staring at my 17 month old little boy.&nbsp; Dinner is punctuated by the other 7-9 family members occasionally turning to stare at us and the baby's mother apologizing for her daughter staring.&nbsp; "She's not usually like this," she says.  After dinner, I decide that my son might enjoy going over to see the little girl and spending time with her while Daddy is paying for the check.&nbsp; While the two kids stare at each other, I'm standing there making chit chat with the other mom about ages, names, and all that other Mommy breeze shooting.&nbsp; Suddenly one member of their dinner party, a curmudgeonly-looking fellow with a long beard looks at me and says in a commanding voice, "Who are you?"  "Uh... my name is Wendy.&nbsp; Who are you?"  "Are you a Realtor?"  Suddenly fearful that he'd had a bad experience in real estate, I was hesitant to respond immediately.&nbsp; Finally I nodded and said yes.  He hit the woman next to him in the arm and said, "See, I told you!&nbsp; She's that woman we saw in the paper this week!"&nbsp; His companion nodded in agreement.&nbsp; They had seen a little article about me in the paper announcing an award I'd received for volume sales.&nbsp; It had my picture, a horrible squinting picture with very bad hair.  The woman jokingly asked for my autograph.  Gotta love life in a small town.

      Nobody ever really knows you. People see what they see through the eyes of their experience, and your final image is a kaleidoscope of traits. Sifting through the shades of perception is a hard job, but it seemed to be my calling during my early twenties, the parentheses of my life I call the ‘what-were-you -thinking’ years.  &nbsp;  Basically, I was a nut, unstable. Well, in a poetic sort of way. Like Virginia Woolf, Zelda Fitzgerald or Anais Nin who wrote a journal entry that could have been my own –  &nbsp;   There were always in me, two women at least, one woman desperate and bewildered, who felt she was drowning and another who would leap into a scene, as upon a stage, conceal her true emotions because they were weaknesses, helplessness, despair, and present to the world only a smile, an eagerness, curiosity, enthusiasm, interest.   &nbsp;  I envisioned myself a tortured, misunderstood, lonely beauty with wells of meaningful, important philosophies. But, what others saw was quite different.   ***********************************************&nbsp; &nbsp;  “Hey, lush,” Seth said as my feet dangled and ribcage popped in his strong embrace. My giant of a little brother still kids me about the period I used to carry a half empty bottle of Captain Morgan’s Spiced Rum in my green and purple striped Guatemalan knapsack. You know, ‘just in case.’ And it didn’t take much for it to be the perfect occasion to pick up a jumbo fountain diet coke from the Circle K to mix a bit of festivity. I haven’t had a spiced rum and coke in years, but every time I just pass by a convenience store, I have a strange longing for the buttery-not-too-sweet flavor of the Captain!  &nbsp;  Some of my ‘what were you thinking’ experiences made a more permanent impact. I still bear the mark of those years in the stately shape of a sunflower tattoo on my left inner thigh.   *********************************************&nbsp;  It was a perfect East Texas day, after the heavy spring rains and right before the condensation days of summer. Hex, my hip, whimsical jeweler boyfriend was in Dallas waiting for an adventure – so I enlisted the help of my wild and free, beautiful friend who longed to be a man, but was born a woman. She picked me up in her rough-and-tumble rusted Ranger pick-up and we began our escapade.  &nbsp;  Back road driving is a tradition, a rite of passage for kids in Texas country, and Allie knew these roads like Arkansas kissing cousins. I sat back to enjoy the ride and take in the view – Oh, the beauty of springtime in Texas. Hills of pink cotton primroses, red velvet thistle, more-indigo-than-blue bonnets, delicate paintbrushes dipped in fiery orange and fields of wide-eyed, worshipping sunflowers.  &nbsp;  The narrow black top road traced the border of farm fences through these fields just a catcall away from the swaying platter-sized heads heavy with seeds. It was there that I decided what I’d seal as my signature – a brazen, strong, prolific, vibrant sunflower. A picture of what I longed to be.  &nbsp;  I proudly announced my decision, and Allie wrinkled her nose. “Get something cool like a snake or a ring of thorns,” she said. She couldn’t hold her stance for long and started laughing. “You are sunshine,” she said. “A sunflower is just what you need!”   ********************************************&nbsp;&nbsp;  “My Tinkerbell,” he said before brushing a kiss on my forehead. Hex dubbed me a little flying fairy early in our relationship and always referred to me as Peter Pan’s mischievous friend. It was either a reference to my slight build, fair skin and hip-length blond hair, or some weird elfin fantasy.  &nbsp;  Already adorned with tattoos, Hex was thrilled at the idea of me getting one. Apparently his extensive knowledge of the art of tattooing kicked in because he immediately announced we were first going to Casa Bonita for tequila shots. We toasted to tattoos, we toasted to friends, we toasted to tequila, we toasted to getting toasted. At a buck-o-five, four shots had me melting to the floor.  &nbsp;  Allie and Hex took action. “Let’s get her to Tigger’s before she changes her mind,” Allie said. And so they did.  &nbsp;  Tigger’s Tattoos in the heart of Deep Ellum, a trendy renovated warehouse district in downtown Dallas, featured a movie screen glass window for spectators to live vicariously through the wantonly tattooed and pierced. With my courage nearly as high as my blood alcohol level, I introduced our trio. “We’re here to get a tattoo,” I said with a crooked, drunken grin.  &nbsp;  A flamboyantly ink-covered young man gestured to the benches lining the wall. “Have a seat,” he said. “Electricity is out. It’ll be another hour or so before we’re up and running.  &nbsp;  Had they overloaded the circuits with too many darting needles? My courage took a turn. “Oh, too bad,” I said. My high school theater classes came in handy as I lifted my hands in ‘exasperation.’ “We simply don’t have the time,” I added hopefully.  &nbsp;  Allie and Hex were way ahead of me – ‘we’ve got plenty of time’, they sang in sickeningly perfect unison.  &nbsp;  We spent the next hour designing the ideal sunflower and selecting the perfect spot to plant it. I decided on my inner thigh – hoping the meatiest part of my body would buffer the sharp vibrations of the needles. (Not nearly as erotic as you were thinking, right?)  &nbsp;  After another twenty minutes listening to tattoo parlor banter -&nbsp; ‘Hey, Toby, there’s another nipple piercing.” “I’m sorry sir, but we don’t have a regulation safety pin large enough to fit that.” “Lady, before we can tattoo you, we have to see the skin.” – Toby the tattoo artist called my name and led me to a dark gray leather and steel dentist’s chair directly facing the wall of windows.  &nbsp;  “I guess you’ll just have to straddle the arms of the chair,” Toby said with a satisfied smile. He was still smiling half an hour later as he put the finishing touches on my immortal flower.

      What inspires us to write? Is it pain, joy, worry, freedom, love? It must be all these things of life that cause a rush of thought and a spattering of words. But, these emotions are never isolated. They always have some connection to God, humanity, to ourselves. It's the connection of life that inspires us to great thought and lovely declaration. It's relationship and all the messiness and beauty that flows from kissing lips, holding hands, cradling heads, bowing knees, praising hearts.  &nbsp;  Two amazing, strong women in my life have inspired me to write -- if only to tell their stories. Their stories are my stories- my mother, my sister, my reflections.  &nbsp;   The Spirit Vine --   for my loving mother, Naomi   &nbsp;   A chronicle that needs no telling,  Enduring balance in an unwavering line.  &nbsp;  Of mind and heart and gaze compelling,  Tender branches from the same spirit vine.  &nbsp;  A steadfast journey of wisdom, strength, of grace bestowing,  A descent of favor and spark of eternal insight.  &nbsp;  Vivid, shining, restoring, knowing –  An ancient beacon, a living signal light.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Veils --   for my enduring sister, Savannah   &nbsp;   Lay your veiled regret upon me,  Bare the ache of things gone wrong,  Visit the dreams that are never to be,  Cry the wounding tears of the silent song.  &nbsp;  Laugh into the mist of love’s pleasure,  Bask in the flowered rings of youth,  Vision the jewels of life’s treasure,  Capture the whisper of our hidden truth.

       So unsure, so insecure, I was terrified of really doing anything because I was afraid of failing, and failing big. I talked about goals, but had no plan. I analyzed myself, but had no answers. I was playing the after-college find yourself game, all the while doing everything possible to lose myself.   My mom, who is my heart and reason, called me her ‘free spirit.’ On the last page of a tenderly created life photo album with images of me opening a longed-for tea set on my fourth birthday, sitting atop an elephant in the rose gardens of Bangkok, holding our beloved Sheltie, Smykket, and receiving my Girl Scout Gold Award she wrote:       Shannon: A Free Spirit   I love that about you. I would that I was so free. You are like a bird, singing its own sweet song – flying free and high. From time to time, you must alight and rest – but then again to soar. I pray that your spirit will reach the utmost heights. I pray that your wings may never be broken.   &nbsp;  She gave meaning and allowance to my confusion, and kept me searching. My dad was the one who instilled the means.  ____________________________________________________________________________  &nbsp;  Scientists can’t prove it’s genetic, but the Morley clan makes a strong case for hereditary wanderlust. My dad’s dad kept his family moving, one dusty town to another, always in search of a better job, a better home, a better life. My father was affected by the ‘other side of the hill’ obsession, too.   He became a United States Foreign Service Officer, and still is the most brilliant man I have ever known. Though, his newest decree not to cut his hair until Osama bin Laden has been captured brings this into some question.   I caught the bus of his whirlwind tour in Bangalore, India. By my senior year in high school, I had lived in Kenya, Thailand, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Norway with stateside turns in D.C, Texas and Hawaii.   My own case of other-longing didn’t start until my second year of college, but when it began, it struck hard. I rushed through the work, barely taking notice of the knowledge and graduated in three years. I thought I needed to get back overseas to the edgy world of color and culture.   Naturally, my first attempt was to take the Foreign Service exam. Apparently, my understanding did not sufficiently extend to the 48 varieties of flies in Chile, the conjugation pattern of Wadjiginy verbs and the conquests of Emiliano Zapata, because they never called.   The Peace Corps looked promising, but the dissertation-length paperwork took the organization so long to file, my stunted attention span switched strategies. Interestingly, I received my assignment letter to go to French-speaking North Africa a few months after I journeyed to Taiwan. By then, I was hooked by the Orient, or so it would seem the bizarre day I was arrested with six other women I had never met.&nbsp;  ____________________________________________________________________________  &nbsp;  I began modeling at sixteen in Honolulu, and carried the super model dream through college. The Asian fashion market was a great money bed for Anglo models, so trying my face at it again seemed like a solid way to make a living while I was looking for my peace, or pieces depending on the point of reference.   I sat on the worn bamboo sofa of the Paper Moon Talent and Modeling Agency on Chien-Yi Road in downtown Taiwan. Still jet-lagged from the leap in time zones, but anxious to establish some income, I settled in for a chance to show my book to the agent. Down the hall from the noisy office, was a dorm set-up where several live-in Western models were watching television.   “Naw see you picta,” said a surprisingly round middle-aged woman. Her sooty black hair was razored close to her head and donut sized gold loops tugged at her earlobes. I opened my book and started to tell her about my experience. “No tawk,” she said flipping the slick pages of my portfolio between her red lacquered nails. “Ah, gud. You gud.” She seemed pleased and I leaned back to let her look.   The building’s mirrored double elevator doors opened directly into the office. Four Chinese men clad in gray-green uniforms escorted a Caucasian woman into the room and held up their badges. A single, slight but fierce officer began issuing what seemed to be orders as the others stood silently. The well-dressed woman accompanying the officers conversed with ease in Mandarin, gestured toward the dorm area and moved in that direction.   Ms. No Tawk jumped up and started yelling. Hoping to go unnoticed, I sat unmoving on the sofa, dodging eye contact.   The rapid banter continued for a few minutes until a lovely brunette teen emerged from her room, dragging a suitcase the size of a twin bed behind her. She followed the woman into the elevator as the officers fenced the entrance.   Another Chinese woman, who had been fielding calls since I arrived, hung up the phone and yelled in perfect English to the models in the back. “Get dressed and get out here. You’re going to the station with these men.”   Five minutes later, six leggy blondes moved into the office. Apparently unconcerned by the commotion, one was nibbling on a ripe, yellow star fruit and another was filing her pinky nail. Three of the officers corralled the girls into the now open elevator. Little Mao Tze Dong turned to join them, but stopped when he noticed me. He barked another question at the agent.   “Bu yao! Bu yao,” she answered. But, he headed for me and gestured for me to come. Too scared to object, I followed.   The other young women and I spent six hours inside a hollow interrogation hall drinking 7-up and taking escorted turns to the bathroom in fearful silence. My free spirit eventually got the best of me and I banged on a table and shouted, “I’m an American. I have rights!”   A few minutes later, the handsome white woman who seemed to have started this peculiar process opened the door. “Sorry for the inconvenience,” she said. “I’m from the Canadian Consulate. We were investigating an issue reported about your agency.” She paused and looked down. “We thought you were hookers. As soon as the police get your finger prints you can go.”   I started laughing at the absurdity of the supposition. She ignored me, turned and left. The Paper Moon secretary later informed me that one of the Canadian models staying with them had phoned her parents in Montreal and baselessly suggested that they were doing ‘more’ than modeling in Taipei.   Though off to a shimmy-shaky start, the rest of my stay in Taiwan was better than I had hoped. Of course, any place is splendid when you are in love.

      A very wise man once wrote:   “If you would have a woman love you, fill her about the brim with love of herself – all that runs over is yours.”   This is exactly what Matt did for me. In fact, he’s the only love I’ve ever had that even attempted. What I was to him was not a name but what he called the essence of pining, and he filled me not with empty words, but a real sense of masterpiece.  We met over dinner at a noodle stand a few blocks from the market shopping district in downtown Taipei. Mutual friends had already decided we’d be a perfect match, and arranged the no-pressure gathering of friends.  Tall and athletic, witty and intense, handsome and intelligent, he fit my desire like a standing ovation.  We all spent that night in lively conversation over drinks at several of the city’s cozy, relaxed places that catered to American expatriates. The soft light of the sun had already warmed the windows of Mama’s Place when we finished our bacon-and-egg breakfast and walked into the morning.  As I opened the red metal door of my third-story apartment, the phone rang. “I haven’t smiled this much in a long time,” Matt said when I answered. “And I have a feeling, you’ll be making me smile for a good long time.”  He always said that’s how it was, that I was the treasure (with the best ‘booty’ around) and he was the bandit, getting away with something he didn’t deserve.  I have a box of letters he penned during our two-year relationship, which tells the truth of the matter. In one cherished note, he wrote:   “Freedom is the right to search for someone who will rid you of this desire. You are my freedom, you are my desire, you are the right someone.”   He filled me to the brim time and time again. But, he never freed me from fear.  Thankfully, no man can do for you, what you can only do for yourself.   Georgia O’Keefe spoke the necessary words of an artist’s heart:   “I’ve been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I want to do.”   I know that cord and the balance required to bear it. It was laced throughout my twenties and even now is an ever-present filter though the stained glass of my life has formed a more reflective likeness.  The parts are forming the whole, and I’m discovering that what I have been to the companions of my life is a piece of who I am, a translucent display of who I was created to be.
