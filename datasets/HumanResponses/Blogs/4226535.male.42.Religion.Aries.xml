       Last week a tour group came to the church.  They were from a church from another town, and were members of a different denomination. It was an interesting 90 minutes. At one point everyone was gathered around the altar. One lady asked what we do around the altar. I told her how our entire community gathers around the altar for communion, how we want everyone close to the table and how everyone particiaptes in the prayer over the bread and wine. So far so good. Then it happened. She got to the heart of what she really wanted to know.   Who can come to communion in your church?,  she asked. My pat answer is well rehearsed. I told her: Jesus invited everyone to his table so we invite everyone to God's table. We give communion to everyone by name-- without exception. She was polite about my response, but clearly appalled.   You mean you don't have to be confirmed?  No, baptism is full membership in our church.   Oh, so you do at least require baptism?  No, we don't require that either.  That's when it really happened. That small exchange revealed the core issue: who is worthy to receive the sacrament? I did my best to explain, to reveal our community's understanding and values, but we didnt' get very far. Our versions of how to live the faith simply didn't match up. She was more concerned with preserving the proscriptive rules of institution of Christianity. I am more interested in the faith continues to live and breathe right in our midst. I don't believe the faith needs to be protected-- but I do believe that institutional Christianity works overtime trying to protect itself. From what I don't quite know. Usually I think it is trying to protect itself from the Spirit.  I believe that as we continue to practice our faith and touch the reality of what it means to live a human life, our beliefs change. We don't need to be afraid of this. In the course of our study and practice, as we touch reality more and more deeply, our beliefs naturally evolve and become more solid. When our beliefs are based on our own direct experience of reality and not on notions offered by others, no one can shake them from us. Making a longterm commitment to a concept is much more dangerous.  Our faith must be alive. It cannot be just a set of rigid beliefs and notions. Our faith must evolve every day and bring us joy, peace, freedom, and love. Faith implies practice, living our daily life in mindfulness. Some people think that prayer involves only our minds or our hearts. But we also have to pray with our bodies, with our actions in the world. And our actions must be modelled after those of the living Christ.  pax [+]

        excerpt from a recent sermon on Luke 12.49-56        In Liberia, a teenaged girl prepares for baptism in the Anglican church. Her parents objected violently to her decision to become a Christian. A few weeks before her scheduled baptism, her parents had her killed.  When I was in college, one of my Jewish friends converted to Christianity. His parents responded by publicly declaring him dead and hold public funeral for him so their friends could join in the mourning.  My colleague Nancy Sehested was called to be pastor of a Southern Baptist Church in Memphis. She was the first woman to hold such a position. The county Baptist association threw the church of out of the association. Later that same year the national Baptist convention severed all ties with that church.  Do you know stories like that?  Like the parents who raise their kids to be doctors and lawyers. They think they’ve almost succeeded when the last one announces he wants to be a minister, and their faces fall. But he goes off the seminary anyway, and then they draw up their wills and he is not in them? Or like the grown children who find out how much money their elderly parents are giving away to a church-run orphanage in the Midwest and who have mom and dad declared mentally incompetent in order to protect their inheritance?  Or like the mother who will not speak to her two adult children because one left the church of his youth for a place where he speaks in tongues and the other refuses to go to any church at all? These are painful stories for any of us who have close family ties and who also hold deep religious convictions. Christ’s invitation to follow him can divide a family, even destroy a family. Jesus acknowledges that pain.  What is so disturbing about these stories is that Jesus does not say they should not be so. In fact, he says the opposite. He says they are inevitable, that the gospel is inherently divisive and that we should not be surprised when we fight about it.  Ever seen that the bumper sticker or the t-shirt that says, “Dear Jesus, protect me from your followers”? I don’t fear God. I don’t fear the government (too much) or the dreaded forces of secularism or humanism. But I do sometimes fear my fellow Christians. There are times when I feel downright intimidated by those I-am-confident-that-I-have-the-corner-on-truth, overachieving, judgmental persons who use the Christian faith as the sanction to denounce and threaten people.  Hate mail and hate crimes increase every year. Well-funded religious and political leaders in certain sectors of the population promote an aggressive “spiritual warfare” against those who will not be numbered among them.  Not too long ago there was a story of college seniors being escorted at night campus security from the library to their dormitory because “Christian” students had spoken about the kinds of things that should happen to people like them if they were caught alone at night. Devious, isn’t it? No direct threat, just the creation of a terrifying atmosphere in which to live.  Maybe Luke was conscious of the growing schism between the followers of Jesus and other Jews in his time. Or maybe he was well aware that Roman law would not grant legal standing to the newly flourishing Christian faith. Maybe he knew Christians who were humiliated in the street or forbidden to attend family reunions with Jewish relatives. But could have imagined the waves of persecution instigated by Christians throughout the ages? I think of Matthew Shepherd who was brutally beaten and his body strapped to a fence in subzero weather-- because he was gay. He was brutally killed by kids who celebrated their form of Christianity.  We think these kinds of incidents are easy to dismiss. We say to ourselves, “this is not Christianity, but a perversion of its deepest truths.” And that is true. But is also true that we so easily fail to communicate unequivocally the most simple of its truths: all persons are created in the image of God.  I suspect all of us have probably experienced painful division at one time or another in our own families. Our religious community in Toledo remains very divided. Trouble is, the deepest divisions are to be found within Christianity right now. So it makes sense that the claims of Christ may all too often call us to stand in opposition to our friends and parents or brothers and sisters. That is neither Good News or Bad News. It’s simply the cost of commitment.  How do we deal with it? How do we stay in communion with those whose vision of God and God’s claim upon their lives is different form our own? How do we stay together? Sometimes we can’t. The differences are just too great. But there is another way.  First, be faithful to the voice of God you hear within you. To deny it is to die to your own integrity. Second, and more important, resist the temptation to claim for yourself more understanding than those with whom you disagree. Instead, listen to them share their understanding. Perhaps you can be helped to hear the voice of God they hear. To deny that possibility is to deny God.

       Have you heard about the latest scandal  to hit institutional Christianity? It's wafer-gate. Seems that Christ can only be found in wheat. Who knew? Normally I don't really care about this kind of liturgical trivia, but I can't shake this story. Here's an excerpt that ran in the  Asbury Park Press  (New Jersey) earlier this week.    Liz Pelly-Waldman of Brielle is trying to convince the Catholic Churchto validate her daughter Haley Waldman's First Holy Communion. BRIELLE -- A woman who is protesting the Diocese of Trenton's decisionto invalidate her daughter's First Holy Communion because analternative wafer was used in the communion sacrament has taken hercase to Rome. Liz Pelly-Waldman of Evergreen Avenue has written to Cardinal JosephRatzinger, Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith inthe Vatican, to plead her case for allowing the use in communion ofhosts that do not contain the food protein gluten, found in wheat andother grains. Church rules maintain that for a wafer -- or host -- tobe "valid matter" in communion, it must contain gluten. Pelly-Waldman, 30, wants that changed to allow her daughter, Haley,and others like her who suffer from celiac sprue disease, to receivethe sacrament of communion. For people with the disease -- one out ofevery 133 people, according to one estimate -- ingesting gluten causesthe body's immune system to attack the small intestine's lining, whichcan lead to malnutrition and possibly cancer. Pelly-Waldman contendsthat any form of the "approved" wheat-based host -- including a newlow-gluten version -- can be fatal to Haley.         Now I don't mean to bash the RCC here-- there but for the grace of God goes any our spiritual glass houses. And it really makes me sad to to hear of the RCC wanting another ditch in which to die, but I do want to use it to highlight what has become so very wrong with institutional Christianity. When did Chrisitanity become Churchianity? For those of us who believe in the real presence of Christ methinks this story misses a deeper truth.       The mystery of the sacrament is not contained in its substance. The sacraments are only made real by the witness of human life. Sort of like the old question about who hears a tree falling in the woods if no one is there. When a community makes Eucharist (gives thanks) together they reveal the deeper communion that is also present-- and more important. Communion is a word for a deep connection with God and with one another. You can't have real communion if that means the little girl has to be excluded from it.      What matters most is not the bread, but inclusion. If baptism is full membership in the church (that's the Episcopal way), then there can't be barriers to full participation in the life of that church. We have to make room. If including a gluten-free alternative is what someone needs, then that's what we do.     Later in the article the mom says that she doesn't believe that her child's relationship with Christ is affected by an ingredient, a technicality.  She also makes a good case for the difference between God's laws and all the others we make around God.    I've just never understood the need the legislate the presence of God.

       Okay, okay. I'm finally doing it.  The blog thing. It may be nice to have a place to put out some thoughts that are not well rounded, not "safe", not too manufactured so no one gets pissed at me for sharing what I really think. We'll see.
