      Whats up....so yea today was freaking tiring....climbing 45-55 feet walls with lil tiny rocks to grab onto is not a fun thing to do. But i wasnt in school today because of it so it was worth it to hang out with eric and marty all day and climb.  Definetly going out this weekend after NYSSMA and SAT's and having a good time, maybe ill hang out with tom's sister or someone from before. Well i gotta get going and do some SAT crap and some NYSSMA practice stuff...later  PS. Lacrosse players are really really dumb and should not be given a hack saw... EVER ..and meg- stop reading my blog like a crazy stalker!!!

      So yea I really hate my parents...like they're  REALLY PISSING ME OFF  NYSSMA this and SAT's that, and Meg was able to do this why cant you, Tim your never gonna be able to go to college cause your not in the top 20 and your major is gonna be hard, its BS.....im tired or their crap.  I HATE THEM!!!  So i have this project adventure climbing thing tomorrow, maybe ill fall and die and wont have to do any of this crap coming up. Yea so this week just keeps getting better and better, maybe the weekend will provide some relaxation.  Birthdays in exactly 2 weeks   and Yellowcard is a really good group...get their album

      What up guys? Today was just like every other day, woke up went to school, slept in most of the classes before lunch, ate lunch and watched the chorus sit there and do absolutely nothing, fall asleep in most of the classes after lunch, come home eat and go running. BUT i did have to take a Regents Practice test for American history, which i got 100 on, b/c my teacher corrected it right after i was done, while the test was still being given to the entire junior class, so im just not gonna study too hard for that regents.   So i used my brain today more outside of school than in today and i realized a whole bunch of shit, and different angles to look at things, and wow things suck right now but yea they can definetly get a lot worse. Oh well, thats why i go out on friday and saturday nights with the guys(eric and matt).   Yea so im really sick right now...god damn stomach...im gonna go curl up in a lil ball on my chair...Ill post later tomorrow night.

      Damn its been a while since ive posted... basically all thats happened is me going to school early, then running after school, then going to school working some shitty concert then coming home to deal with my parents yelling at me, or sometimes go out to dinner because i really havent eaten that much lately...lost 4 pounds(117)gross. Lately everythign has just sucked major dick, oh well i'll find some way to deal with it.  Yea rain thunder and lightning are not good things at work, all the boats have to come off and all the energy you spent putting 100 boats in the water in a half hour or hour is wasted because everyone comes flying back in, pisses me off.   Went to the mall last night though, kinda the highlight of my week, but it was freaking weird, " someone's " really close friend Jill was at the mall and like we talked for a lil while and im now supposed to talk to her when i see her...thought everyone hated me, guess not. But i got a Zippo and a kick ass game so im set for a lil while.   Wow this post is soo fucking hard to understand, im sorry guys. gonna get some sleep  FRISBEE THIS WEEK ON THURDAY....AND I DONT HAVE A CONCERT, SCORE

Was at work all day today and last night so ive made a nice bit of money but i have nothing to spend it on...oh well maybe ill go out by myself tomorrow night for dinner.   Damn this week i have 3 more concerts to do along with i think 2 next week too.....i hate this shit. Oh well if i dont do it noone else will which would piss the " heads " which is something i dont want to do but i dont want to do these concerts another year.

      So todays been sooo long. Up at 6:15, school all day then crew loading in a plot for the Genovese benefit coming up, so ive been soooo tired. And of course i have tendonitis in my lower leg so doing all the work on the A-frame sucked.   LIke i feel this day completely drained me.....i just realized im gonna get  WORKED  the next 2 or 3 weeks with all the concerts and shows. I even have a show on my birthday....that sukcs, but ill deal. I honestly dont want to do anything anyway except going out next weekend with my friends.    IM JUST SOOO TIRED  and i know ive said that like 4 times, like not only physically but mentally 2. i just cant stay focused on anything cause i have too much going through my head......ARG....whatever im going and doing something i havent decided yet.

      Man, I'm gonna be sooo whiped the next 2 or 3 weeks...soo many concerts, I even have one im supposed to work on my birthday, how much does that suck? So school was decent, like it wasn't horrible, but it wasnt great.   So i figured out that i have a tendonitis in my freaking leg....and of course what do i do, go up on the A-frame and run 4 miles. How much more dumb do i seem now? BUT i had a good talk with someone while i was running so that seriously made me feel better.  Ok well im gonna get going and ice my leg or heat my leg...i dunno do sometihng to it to try and get it to feel better since im really not supposed to do anything on it for a few days. Ill be back later or something, maybe, Later

      Hey whats up guys the past couple days have made this week suck even more....Nyssma I didnt do as well as i needed to do, so i have to wait another year until i can get into Music Honor Society so that sucks, and a couple of friends wont talk to me anymore which sucks even more, I pulled a muscle in my calf so it took me even longer to run 7 miles yesterday(been doing that a lot lately, its a good time for me to think), parents are just freaking psycho and thats all im gonna say bout that, and i still havent found out who that freaking person is....like i havent found anything out. Well i gotta go eat some pizza then go running maybe ill post again later tonight.

           I havent posted in a really long fucking time...damn, not like anyone reads this anyway, so basically im writing shit out to myself......score. Worked at New York Brothers this weekend along with Bear Mountain, w/e ill deal with the bull shit thats going on up there. Went out almost every other night and for about 4 days there every night....we all know what i was doing. I AM GET REALY FRUSTRATED WITH PEOPLE WHO CONTINUE TO TELL ME THAT ITS A PROBLEM WHEN THEY ARE NEVER AROUND WHEN IM DOING IT AND I NEVER DO IT TO THE EXTREME POINT EVERY TIME, SO STOP. I have my last fucking test on wednesday, then ill be done with this TOTAL BULL SHIT that ive managed to put up with for the past year.       On a lighter note, i found someone new i have a thing for, now only if i can go up to her and have more of a conversation than, "wheres this pizza going" or "how much do i owe you?" then ill be set.      Whatever i have some studying to fucking do...not like anyone gives a shit so later
