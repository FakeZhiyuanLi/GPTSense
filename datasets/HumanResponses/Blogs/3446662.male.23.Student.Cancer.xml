      Well as the title suguest, its been days of hitting the test books for this coming Mass test.. which in my case is extremely important.. one test i cant even afford to do badly.. due to the failure in the first one..  i do hope .. and seriouly hope .. ever since hearing all the horible things from my fourth yr friends that .. my lecturer would have mercy on us... or rather me.. but then i am in a very smart class this year as compare to the previous batch which means that if i do badly i will be very skew to the left or right ina stat showing of results..(anyone whom did stat would know what i am saying)  but then it not all bleak in which the last couple of posting have suguest!.. one month to holiday.. one semester down and three more to go.. which mean that i am ever closer to one major mile stone in my life..  But i must say .. whenever there is a test..it seem that there is nothing else in life... hopefully the soccer game after the test would help loosen up things!  haiz...  like one of the national day song goes..  'Forward, marching forward!'  i will march forward to my dreams... hopefully not day dream....

      The end of something means the start of another..very true indeed when applied to the situation of the guys of class 2004 yr three international chemical engineer student at Uq.. the nsd of thermo assignment, is the start of gaining enough knowledge to pass the mass test..  havent had dinner at singapura for a long time and tonight was the night ... the guys for treating gals after a hard night of work.. and yuup me tap in to chill out.. weather here in Brisbane have become more and more cold as it approaches the peak of the winter season...  i just realise one thing.. i realise what people mean by forbitten fruit always looks tastier .. how many time in my life.. have i not treasure the things that i have or going to have.. but to give up the very last miniute ..... not thinking first....  saw this lady sitting very very next to me.. she looks like someone or feel like someone i would like to share my joy and sorrow... but then it seem that, she does not seem interested in me... anyway i been thinking.... is it really me or what ?... or the way i approach a gal  someway or another.. something is very wrong..cause i am like always barking up the worng tree..... looking at how i chase gals from the gal is single to she is attach... i think .. if there is one for the hall of failures.. this would rank in as one of the top ten.. hahhahah  welll as i listen to Eric cartman version of Elvis , in the getto and nowo stupid.. child i realise  nothing....

      haiz... things is really picking up man  First have to finish the thermodynamic assignment then later, heat and mass test...wow 'marchim' everyday i am fighting to stay in this course.. sometime when i am walking home i wonder if i made the right choice to further my studies.. but then now that i am here.. i better make the best out of it....  I was thinking man.. how come sometimes people will help you to do something, even thought they ..well dont know you well?.. hmmm how do the human mind work?.... why do ex galfriend delete your name form their phone book, why do all the gals that you fall for.. seem to fall for someone else?...why do people you know, dont study hard or ratherdont do anything.. do better than you in test ?.. why do aussie youngsters like to shout out of the car at asians.... when you cant hear half the fuck what there are trying to say due to the speed of the car.... why do life have to have so many why right... thats what i wonder sometimes  Was at the pizza cafe just now .. and was talking to unice and CW... and it stuck me that .. time is passing very fast.. if i manage to finish in two yrs time.. i will be in my mid twenties... and what will i do then... it suddenly stuck me(so many ah) that i am still pretty much aimless in life even .. with my 5 yr plan.....  sometime i wonder life could be as simple as eating a pizza when you are hungry... when you are not full keep odering .. till you are full haizzzz i think i need to retrest to Sholin to do some deep thinking   Need to call home.. but then .. knowing me. i am so fucking lazy .. i am not even picking up the phone to cal home.. haiz who am i ....  well like Murphy Rule,( did i get that correct?) hmm what ever will go wrong , will go wrong..  its friday the 28 may at 1.20 am in the morning and listening to REM's losing my religion... could i be losing fath... in myself?... haiz......

      Its being a couple of days since i last had alog... and yah it was the lazy self that was focing me not to write but then.. the last couple of days have happen not too much to interest even myself  just this wednesday, my leg started to swell... and yah things became worse.. now i am on anti-flamation drug and also pain killer... hopefully everthignis okie..  As my ex boss say, i am easily distracted from my goals and objective... and that is pretty true this few days.. i am pretty affect by this lost of th usage of my left leg.. and it is hampering any effort to study for exam..  wow one sem is almost over...somwtime i wonder man, what is wrong to have a relationship from someone with a different religion or same sex.. in the last couple of months i have discovered from observation, that love is Really blind, love sometime cannot go beyond religion, marchim like the story River Between, where Wahyaki of old tribal religion falls in love with numbura, of christian convert  Is there really no space for extremes to become mormality?... can we just like what we do in statistic, whenever we have a skew left or right curve, we just log it to look symmetry?..  what is wrong with this freaky ...  anyway just wanna say that the Doctor taht attended to me, Dr Anne-Mary, was a very nice Doc, who went all out to explain things to me and also reassure me that things are not that bad..... i'll give a 9/10 for professionism  as for the exams.. dont wish me luck.. i dont want it i want hard work to paid thru.

But then with every sunset.. there will be a sunrise... i just hope i will be able to get there in the end!
