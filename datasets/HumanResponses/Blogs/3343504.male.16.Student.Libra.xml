      Since young i like to stare into the sky at night and look at all the stars... so bright and so shiny... There are so so so many stars in the sky ... Glittering .. wow..  i belive that everybody in this world will at least have a star that belongs to him or her only , at least one ... while some will have more and some will have less but everybody will at least have one of his or her own star ...  to me , stars will bring us sweet dreams with the moon and starz will bring us good luck ...our start will always be by our side when we are lonely or when we are sad or happy and just feeling normal  , never gonna leave us ... aint starz great???   stars will also bring us happiness ... right???  but some times starz will also have their own dayz when they aint feeling happy ... so when ever i dont see the stars at night in the sky ... they arent happy ... but the next night,  u will see them in the sky again and their unhapiness are all gone. thatz why i say starz aint litte petty starz ... they live everyday as happy as they can be ...  i hope that everybody can be like every of their starz ... live happly every day with no worries ...  thankz my little star...

      there is this song that i really really like, and that's close to you by the Carpenters ...  The lyrics are so nice ... really really so nice that how you wished you were the one ...  &nbsp;   -close to you-   &nbsp;   Why do birds suddenly appear    Every time you are near?    Just like me, they long to be    Close to you.     &nbsp;   Why do stars fall down from the sky    Every time you walk by?    Just like me, they long to be    Close to you.     &nbsp;   On the day that you were born    The angels got together    And decided to create a dream come true    So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold    And starlight in your eyes of blue.     &nbsp;   That is why all the girls in town    Follow you all around.    Just like me, they long to be    Close to you.     &nbsp;   On the day that you were born    The angels got together    And decided to create a dream come true    So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold    And starlight in your eyes of blue.     &nbsp;   That is why all the girls in town    Follow you all around.    Just like me, they long to be    Close to you.     &nbsp;   Just like me (Just like me)    They long to be Close to you.     &nbsp;   --- End ---   &nbsp;  the lyrics is really really nice ...  how is wish that the angels decided to make a dream come ture when i was born.  sprinkle moondust in my hair and starlight in my eyes...  &nbsp;  hmmmm how dreamy is that huh ....  &nbsp;    different ppl are born with different fate and different destiny ..      some are good while some are bad ...      for me , mine was unfortunatly bad...      i did grumbled...      i did curse and swear at god ...      i did long for alot of things ...      i didnt like my life ...        &nbsp;     i envy lots of ppl...      lotz and lotz of ppl...      but itz just useless , it cant help in anyway,      it just makes u feel worst upon seeing wat ppl have that u dont        &nbsp;    after living&nbsp;my life&nbsp;, i found that even though&nbsp;it maybe tough ,      but when u have all&nbsp; your friends and you tried all your ways to find fun in your life and better prospect in life&nbsp;, the fate and destiny of your can be changed ....      i learned not to be envious of wat ppl have but be happy with wat i have ...        &nbsp;    no more&nbsp;did i&nbsp;grumbled about my life      no more did i curse and swear again      but i just wish ...         &nbsp;    wish that everythings ok for my loved ones and ppl around me ...      happiness ...
