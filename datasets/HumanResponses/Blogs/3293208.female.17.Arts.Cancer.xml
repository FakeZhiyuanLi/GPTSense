      why do i have to have parents that mess w/ me constantly. it seems now that they don't trust me. and on top of that i thought melissa an i were finally getting along, but that is too much to hope for. the bitch needs help w/ her fucking mood swings. i swear that she's mental. if she fucking messes w/ me tonight there will be an extra body in the ground tomorrow. well going to plan how to wreck her life entirely. later.

      I'm really happy,(if you couldn't tell from the title). I just got back from a date w/ dustin. I got to show him off to my friends at the movie club; and from the last entry, it was ok w/ him that I didn't meet him for lunch. I just disappointed him a bit. Well we went and saw "dodge ball". It was pretty funny, but I really didn't care for it that much. Yeah well that's all for now. Later.

      i really fucked up. i was sapost to go meet dustin to day for lunch but i slept in untill 1:10. i feel really bad about it, and partially b/c when we were talking on the phone last night and he said it would just make his day if i showed up to see him and i didn't and knowing him he's going to be pretty sad the rest of the day untill he gets home and calls me. yeah and i died my hair yesterday, for any one who cares, it's now a lot of different colors, like red, pink, bleach blond, darkerblond, a little bit of brown. yeah it might sound wierd but it looks really cool and i love it so i'm going to keep it untill school starts up and i have to have a "natural" hair color. well that's all later.

      hey all who read this. i'm kinda getting over marx. and let me tell you that dustin had no trouble trying to talk to me and make me feel better. we agree that we are going to go out when school starts up again. the reason that we aren't going out this summer is because we want a relationship were we see each other every day type thing, although we are gonna go to the movies this summer. yeah well, later.
