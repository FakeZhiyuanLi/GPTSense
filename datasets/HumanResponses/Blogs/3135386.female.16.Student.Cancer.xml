      I got tested for contact lenses today. For anyone who hasn't had contact lenses, basically they stick a pair on, and send you to the waiting room for 20 mins so they can see how your eyes adjust to them. Now, getting to the waiting room was interesting. Normally they try you with a pair of lenses that match your prescription, but I have a wierd one (perscription that is), so they put over-corrective lenses on me. The nurse people made fun of me as I staggered like a drunk to the waiting room...Hey, it looked straight to me!  I actually was a little bit apprehensive to getting tested. I must say, thankfully I'm friends with the doctor, we go to karate and that. He's a funny guy. *grins*   My best friend's little sister actually at his rotten cheeseburger yesterday and went home sick. None of us can understand how she ate half the burger when the meat was blue and white, and the cheese was green, and not realise that something was horribly wrong. Oh well, I hear she's feeling a bit better this evening.  Thankfully all the snow is gone. It was actually +24 yesterday, and our maths teacher took us all outside. I tanned a bit. *grins*  Only 20 more days of school, 10 days until our band trip, and approx 41 days until I go to Brazil.  Anyway, I'm talking to Mal now and a friend of her's named Kristy, for the first time in ages...and I have to go study for a Geo test tomorrow. *groan*  Must remember to take that cd!  Tchau!

       Song: Shining Collection  Mood: Slightly Sad :(  Going over a list of things I'd like to have. (hint hint for anyone who reads this. Even though I don't think anyone does.*winks*)       Digital Camera (3.2 MP and up)  Gameboy Advance SP  Earrings  Funky Pens/Pencils  Eaglestrike (book)  Graviation DVD set  Memory Card for the N64  Escaflowne Soundtrack  Postcards (which I collect)  Pins (Also collect. It's a big thing with the long-term exchangers as well.)      Hmm, I think that's all for now. Just spoke briefly with Maju on IM. I was describing the snow situation to her. She said it was cold in Brazil. But, being the selfish person I am, I forgot to ask her how cold it was there. ^_^

      Wow...it's gretting pretty bad outside. And I've had a pretty eventful day. *grins*   Ours was the only school division not cancelled. On the radio it was like 'Cancelled', 'cancelled', 'cancelled', 'and in **** ****, it's day 6! *eyeroll*. So anyway, I stagger to school, (it's that familiar, walk one step forward, two steps back that we're used to with winter. Get to school, and then the snow starts to fall. Again. But no, not in time to cancell the buses.   Go to first two classes, then dash between the two schools to go to band class. Get back into the highschool at lunch to find out that the buses have been cancelled, and that storm billets are being called to find out what to do with everybody who rides bus.  The office had probably 30-40 people crammed around it with people trying to use on of the two phones we have. Wisely, after grabbing a quick lunch, Robin and I head to the library where I know there is a phone that will be free. (This is just one of the many benefits of knowing the librarian on a first name basis. *grins*)  So I phone dad and get permission to go home. Robin does the same, and so we leave with Cara, our grade 12 friend, and her dad gives us a ride home. After a harrowing ride down main street, (lets just say, her dad likes to talk and gesture at the same time,"steering wheel? What steering wheel?") we finally get home.  Robin and I set up the anime chair, and watch about 6 episodes of Gravitation on the computer, the phone ringing constantly. Triss rang me up asking if I needed a ride into work. I said sure, since dad's stuck at work and mum's stuck in a city 2 1/2 hours away because the roads are closed. Then, a friend of mum's phones up and asks if her kids can come here, since she's working a double shift at the hospital. I say sure, as long at they don't mind being by themselves for a few hours 'cause I have to work. (The kids are 13 and 15) Immediatly, I phone Jordan (the librarian) and ask if she can work for me this evening, if I look after her kids in return. She said she'd pull some strings. (And these phone calls were made after several wrong numbers, busy lines, among other things)   Right after that, mum's friend phones up and said her husband actually made it into town and would be able to take her kids home. So I had to phone Jordan up and say I didn't need her to work affter all. Two hours later, and after several phone calls to mum to keep her updated on the situation, Triss phones and says she's leaving to pick me up. (work is a 5 min drive, tops) 40 mins later, she phones saying she got stuck twice getting out of the motel, and two more times down town and she can't make it here.   So, now I'm home alone, and don't have any kids showing up. *grins* Finally, I phone dad and ask him to come home, because he has to travel on the closed roads and if Triss got stuck twice in town, I want him home. So he says he's already trying to go, he's just digging himself out the drive. He gets home, and we live on a hill, right? So, he takes the hill fast to get up in the snow, pulls in to the drive, skids, and is no longer parellel with the house, he finds himself facing it. And stuck. So for the past hour he's been trying to dig himself out. It was hilarious, he was reving the engine on the truck and that freaked Dime out and she was barking, trying to nip the tires. *laughs* I got a picture and then disappeared in the house because dad's started swearing at the snow blower because it decided not to work.  LMAO! All in all, an eventful day.  I'll have to update again later.

      I was just talking with Robin. It really felt like the best conversation we've had for a while; talking about the old days and all. What ever happened? When did life become so screwed up? It's strange. I was venting some of my anger out, how I hate how people take advantage over other people and use them, how they don't realize how lucky they truely are. I know life isn't fair, but why can't it be?  I have a goal I'm aiming for. To be a long-term Rotary exchanger. But I know for reasons, stuff that it wouldn't be fair to vent on here, I may not get to fullfill my dream.  Why does it seem that some people get all the luck in life? Why are some people blessed with all these amazing talents, and skills and items, and they just waste them?  I think the thing that bugs me the most, is sometimes I see these traits in myself also...  Why can't life be like my logic puzzles? If you have 'a' and you add 'b' the result is 'c'. Simple. *sigh*  Only 48 more days...

       Song:  Final Vision- Yoko Kanno  Mood:  Happyish  I got a new nickname today. Will and Sarah seems determined that I be called Nutsy. (Insert eyeroll) I can't even remember how it came up now. (Update: Will has just informed me that it stared with Sarah calling me whats-her-nuts and so she (Will) decided I should be called Nutsy like the vulture off of the cartoon Robin Hood. Nothing like friends to give you self confidece.)  Today's been a slow day. I couldn't believe it; when I woke up this morning, it was snowing. SNOWING!! It's the middle.of.flipping.MAY!!  I'm still on the countdown until I leave for Brazil. Only 49 more days. (Give or take since I'm still unsure of when I go.) It's starting to feel more real now. I've spoken to Maju (going by her IM name BTW ^_^) I've been studying my portuguese dictionary. I've been to the orientation...got my Canada jacket that identifies me as an Rotary exchange student. I feel so proud to wear it. *wipes away a tear*  Messing around on Windows Media Player until I think it's time to get ready for Karate. Must remember to iron my gi also. Debating whether to stick with Media player or go to Winamp, or what ever it's called. Cara and AJ were bugging me about it. (Damn techies...)

      Listening to: I am Canadian (Molson) Reading: Chicken Soup for the Traveller's Soul Mood: Happy...party time tonight!!  Wow...time sure flies by fast, even when I am looking forward to something.  It's been such a busy week, and it's just not slowing down. Friday: Worked Saturday: Worked Sunday: Worked Monday: Worked Tuesday:Robin came over Wednesday: Robin and I went to her place, and two others came over a well. Long story...lets just say it was a very interesting Lord of the Rings marathon (that was my boob!!!)(screamed by every girl there at least once...0 Thursday: came home, went straight to an eye appointment, went to Rotary meeting, drove half an hour, went shopping, came home, went to karate and then dashed to prom. (three friends graduating...this sucks. -_-)  Today-->Friday: Party in the next down (a 'my birthday/school's out/very early guy fawkes day) Saturday: Work Sunday: Work Monday: Work Tuesday-Thursday: Get ready to go to brazil...  Wow...finally thanks to one of the rotarians in my club, who was a bit annoyed that I hadn't heard anything about this exchange phoned up my YEO and asked about what was going on. I finally, have answers. *grins* Hopefully, the visas should arrive today, and then he'll buy tickets, and we'll leave on July 1st. If they don't arrive until next week, we'll be going the week after. I feel enormously relieved, I had nearly managed to convince myself that I wasn't going to get to go, because we hadn't heard anything (even with phoning) for two months...  Huge kudos goes out to Roberta who although she didn't have to, was on the phone finding out all this info for me, instead of just sympathizing like everyone else because we were really at a loss of what to do.  Tchau!

       Manga:  Lament of the Lambs  Song:  Behind Blue Eyes: Limp Biscuit version  Book:  Romeo and Juliet  Movie:  Gothika  Project:  Making lapel pins; writing my fanfiction   LOL, I have so much to talk about, (mainly because I never update ^^) but, sadly, I think I'm going to do it tomorrow when I should be studying for my exams, rather then miss out on any more sleep. ( prioritizing was never my strong point)  Just a list to remind myself though  * Going to a school Rave in the next town * Going shopping with my friends * Going to Regina on the band trip. * And of course, updates on my exchange.  Let's just say, it's been a very interesting couple of weeks. *eyeroll* Understatement of the year. I've had such a blast. Well, appart for the whole vaccination drug side effect thing. *shudders*  Anyway, going to bed now, I might work on my fanfiction a little more, and check the Rotary message board one last time.  Tchau!

      My goodness...I've just come to the conclusion that I'm a paranoid freak....hehehehe. On the flight down here. He, I'm going to die.On the  rollarcoaster . OMG, we're going to die!!! Bungee jumping "....." maybe best not to repeat what I said when we bungee jumped...hehehe. Now today, riding the cable car up the hill....thinking the whole time "We're going to die...would I rather the call fall there, or here....we're so going to die..." Hehehe...  Willeke always makes me hyper. *grins* How could anybody be not, when they have to put up with "banana land" and god knows what else she's said to me....  hm...quick recap I think. I'll do the same thing Mal does...  Tuesday: Surfing thing. Already taked about that.  Wednesday: Didn't do much (that I can remember) until the evening, appart from Gabby (yay, Gabby! She's cool!) coming over and showing me all these different Brasilian artists. I'm going to burn a cd of music before I come home, and maybe keep practising the...my pathetic portuguese when I'm back in Canada. ;)Carlos, Maju, Matt and I went out for Mexican. Then, since the Mexican place ripped us off (hehhem, they gave us doritos. It wasn't nachos, or tacos, or what ever the hell we ordered. It was Doritos.) So, we went out for pizza. (The same place we went before with Lyndon, with the chocolate and cheese pizza...) This time we had um...Bacon and Pineapple on one, and Frango on the other. Excuse me, chicken. I wasn't that hungry, (hehehe) and I only ate about half a piece.  Thursday: Gabby came over in the afternoon and we watched Gilmore Girls on tv. ^_^I love Gilmore Girls....*shifty eyes* In the evening, We (Maju, my host mum and I) went to Beira Mar where we had fun with the ATM trying to get it to give me some DAMN MONEY!! Hehe...needed to get that off my chest.  Friday: Spoke to Willeke, e-mailed willeke while speaking to here for a second time, and went out running/walking. I haven't been running for so long! I'm so out of shape. *sigh* I can't remember how to spell either...is it spelt haven't or havn't. Ecuse, or Excuse. Ugh,I even said Tipniklicky, instead of typically....I can't spell that anymore either...Agh! Anyway. Went to a 'goodbye Bruna/hello kate' party at Bruna's and then, after leaving that, went out for camarão...as usual, Carlos spilt something on the table. Farofa...long story with the farofa...hehehe  Today: Went to Balneário Camboriú today. Rode up the hill in the cable car went shopping...a very beautiful city. Came back...very sad. It's the full moon today. It was the full moon on the day I arrived in Brasil. That was some of my first word in portuguese (besides the traditional, 'hello, good-bye, thank-you' etc) Lua cheia....Just like tonight, that night, the night I came was very beautiful.  Hehehe...getting sappy in my old age. Of 16. My god I'm pathetic. I love seeing Floripa at night. I love seeing the bridge all lit up. I could live in Floripa happily enough. ^_^ Going out tonight to Lagoa with Maju and Carlos. There's a good-bye party for Tom (Hawaii) More people leaving. It's sad. In two and a half weeks, that'll be me.  I don't want to leave!  ugh...happy thoughts, happy thoughts....hehehe I'm understanding more portuguese now. Not when it counts (like when someones talking to me) but When I listen to conversations, I can normally follow, if not understand all (depends on the topic/how fast people are talking) of what's going on. Matt's really easy to understand, I think because he makes the difference between words, and they're clear. unlike Maju...hehehe. Neh.  I want to talk to Willeke. Bored bored...not bored. Just anxious...??? BLAHH!  -Hannah

      Bruna invited me to go to her English Conversation class again and so, Maju and I took the buss from Trindade and went to her school. Hehehe...the bus was one of the acordian-type&nbsp;&nbsp;buses (the ones that bend in the middle), so I was kept amused the whole way . I met Kate there, which was really cool. She's just got to Brasil from the USA two days ago, so everything still new, bright and shiny....heheh, it still is for me too. ;) We were half an hour late getting out of that class, Bruna was worried that Maju was going to kill her. hehehe...  Maju and I grabbed another bus home, and we quickly got changed, went to Mariana's house, then rushed down to Trindade Terminal again. There we met up with Victor, and...Julio?? I think? I couldn't catch his name, and we all took a bus to Lagoa, then hopped on another to take us to Praia Mole. Met up with Limão and Carlos, and three of the guys went surfing, while Carlos stayed on the beach. I've never seen waves like that before, (Carlos said they were like, three or four feet high) and I've never seen sand so fine. It was very beautiful.  Hehe...Carlos spotted a broken surf board in the water and went to get a picture for me or the guy with the two pieces....and I'm going to learn how to do this next week? Yay! ^_^  In the evening Gabby came over. We were talking in my room for like, 2 hours while Maju was on MSN. She decided to go when it was 11:30pm and so I switched with Maju and went on the computer. Spoke to Kate, and Carlos (a half english ,half mutilated portuguese on my part....thankfully Lucas was helping me a little bit.) Lots of fun....I had such an incredible day. I can't wait to learn how to surf either. hehehe....

      We're moving. I just needed to say that. Moving. When I go home, I won't be in the same house. I go from one strange house to another. Moving...hehe, at least all that packing before I left wasn't for nothing. That's going to be strange. Going back home and have moved. LOL, the Elli-Maria (Finland exchange student) will probably be more familiar with my house then I am! Well, maybe not. I'm not sure when she's moving in. But it's a thought...  Hehehe...longer post up later today. I need to check some words in it first.  *laughs*

      Well, I've found out, that Carlos, Maria-Julia,  and  my parents all read this....I'll have to be careful what I write now. For example. I can't say Carlos is an ugly banga...*laughs* Brincando Carlos!   On another note, guess who's been bungee jumping. Yes, that's right, yours truely! Hehehe... On Thursday I believe, Me, Lucas, Bruno, Maria-Julia and her dad all went to São Paulo, a full day's drive away. (About the same distance as Edmonton is from home)   On friday we drove to Hopi Hari, an amusement park about an hour away from the hotel. There, I (the girl who before was afraid of elevators....*laughs*) Went on a rollarcoster twice.&nbsp;I went on this ride that takes you three storeys up into the air, and makes you do summersaults over and over again. I went on this thing called the Eiffel Tower that takes you up 23 stories, then drops you. I've been on rides that make me feel like I'm a moracca. (sp?) And then, I've been bungee jumping...   Maju, Bruno and I&nbsp;walked to the otherside of the amusement park, and paid for this ride.  Strange , I thought to myself.  Haven't we already paid?  Maju asks if I want to go on and I say sure, why not. We go around to the back of the building, and we have to wait in this room. Stupidly, I ask, "So what are we doing?" She looks at me as if I've sprouted another head, and says "OMG...you don't know!? We're going bungee jumping!"   Me: "Oh. Right then." I sit down to wacth Charlie's Angels on the tv, and the whole time I was thinking...wow, in 10 mins, we're going to be doing that. (as they fly through the air)   It was amazing!&nbsp;Well, I don't think it was bungee jumping exactly, but I didn't know what else to call it. Close enough, you go ridiculous heights in the air, to fall the the ground secured only by a bit of cloth and rope and suddenly you're a pendulum going back and forth. It was so cool, the best part of the trip!--but I stil don't think I'll be doing it again any time soon. ^_^   Went on some more rides and then went to get something to eat at McDonalds. I"ve been to more McDonalds since I've been in Brasil, then I ever have before in my life. *laughs* I'm going to be so fat when I go home.   Got home at about 6pm yesterday (Sunday) evening. Phoned up dad, and then spoke to Steph amd&nbsp;Matt on MSN for a bit. A big group of us went out to Mecena's Bar at 10:30pm and stayed until just after 1am. It's was pretty good, I listened/tried to dance (It was so crowded!) &nbsp;to pagode music, saw one drunk guy trying to Samba (I think, he looked like he was doing the funky chicken) and otherwise, had a lot of fun. My first time going to a club.&nbsp; *nods* Cool.   Neh, going to go upload some more pics now.

      Okay, I'm late with posting...but yesterday was my birthday. Got up early (çause of some stupid person outside my window with a hammer and a piece of metal) watched Gilmore Girls...spoke to my mum and dad. Thanks heavens ^_^ Found out my dad can't work for a month, and broke some ribs but if he hadn't been wearing his seatbelt he most likely would have been killed. Well...good morning Hannah.... &nbsp; Didn't do much until Carlos came over at about 3pm. Then we made Brigaderio, and a cake. After cake #1 was taken out of the oven, and pryed out of the pan, they decided it was best to make cake #2. (this became a unanimous vote after half the cake snapped when Carlos was prying it up with a knife and&nbsp;landed on top of the microwave) Gabby came over to do cake #2, while Maju and Carlos made some more Brigaderios....we were in the middle of doing the last batch, when we'd noticed ants had gotten a hold of the first bunch. My god... &nbsp; I got an e-mail from my mum, birthday greetings from most people on my MSN list, brithday greetings from people I hardly know...and yet, my best friend hasn't come on MSN or even sent an e-mail. *growls* I've been needed to talk with her for ages!! I can't phone 'cause it's too expensive, no one's come online from back home for me to ask them to phone her...It's so frustrating. I can't even send an e-mail because she rarely checks her e-mail. &nbsp; *sighs* &nbsp; Well, hopefully we're going to a club tonight. We were going to go last night but then either everyone couldn't afford it, or couldn't be bothered to go. Tonight it's free for the girls, and cheap for the guys...she my fingers are crossed. Ugh, I need something to do. Nothing really happens until the evening. &nbsp; Robin....Mal....someone....come online. &nbsp; -Hannah

      HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!!! &nbsp; Last night Lyndon came over and Maju, him and I went out to meet Carlos and Vito to go see Garfield. It was an okay movie, the graphics (aka, Garfield) were amazing though! I'm not saying he looked real, but the way he interacted with other characters....wow. LOL, Lyndon found an empty bottle of wine under his seat.... &nbsp; We went out for pizza after that. The first was Chicken and Cheese. I though that was strange, chicken on pizza?? *laughs* That was until I saw the second pizza of course, chocolate and cheese. Now I see why Brasilians eat pizza with knifes and forks though....Man, it sounds disgusting, but that pizza was so good!! &nbsp; Made plans for my birthday party, which is...uh, well today. Carlos is coming over and making me a birthday cake (wow, that's so&nbsp;cool of&nbsp;him!)&nbsp;While Maju teaches me how to make Brigaderio (sp?) For all you in Canada, I'll make&nbsp;them when I return. ^_^ Vito? and possibly Lyndon and a few other people are coming over at 7pm to have a little party thing and then at 11pm we're going to Mercena's Bar (a dance club) till, according to Maju, 5 or 6 in the morning...hehehe....('nough said) &nbsp; -Hannah ps. Check out my photos of Brasil...well...soon I'm have more photos of Brasil...oh just check out my photos. And leave a comment if you please! ^_^

      Found out yesterdy that my dad and my puppy dog were in a car accident, after some stupid idiot blew a stop sign on the highway, and my dad piled into him. Thank heavens they (my dad and&nbsp;puppy) are&nbsp;both okay. My dad is in hospital, seatbelt sore, and my dog face-ploughed the dash board, and they're both in shock, but I think otherwise they're both okay, at least according to what my mum said on the phone yesterday. This is so hard, being on exchange and finding out something like this has happened at home! Man...I'm so worried now that something else is going to happen. Well, I can say it did, Paul e-mailed today to tell me that a girl I know and like has been relocated from fostercare because her foster parents were abusing her or something like this. *growls* It makes me so angry! Why can't people just treat each other like human beings; we all have feelings. We all laugh, and cry, and feel pain...no matter how different we look, we're all deep down, still the same species.  &nbsp;  On a brighter note, I'm having a great time here. Yesterday I got invited by Matt (south-african dude) to go to a club in Coastão de Santina (sp?) and me and Maju were going to go, but then some stuff happened, so they decided it was too late to drive the 30mins out there. :(&nbsp;Me, her, Carlos, and Vito drove around, Carlos hunting down looking for prostitutes/drag queens&nbsp;so he could take a picture for me....*eyeroll*&nbsp; He actually succeeded too. &nbsp;  LOL, Carlos: "Heeeere bitches....heeeere bitches....bitchy bitchy bitches..."  &nbsp;  Then we went out to Lagoa de Conceição at 12:30am before blowing a tire on the way back. That was fun. Then we were going to another girl's house to watch a movie. Made it home and hour and a half late after curfew....(at 3:30am) Today, we all went on a boat ride in Lagoa to this restaurant (which you could only reach by boat) it was beautiful, fun, but very cold! And windy! Got home from the restaurant, and Maju, Gabby and I went to a Festa de Junina party, but left early because it wasn't that good. I saw Nathen there (exchange student) I meant to go talk to him more, but he disappeared....we walked home (after eating a hot dog, with corn, peas, onions and tomatoe stuff...@_@ but good...) We (Maju, Gabby and I) watched 'My Boss' Daughter (I typed an e-mail to Paul at the same time) and then we went to Carlos' birthday party.  &nbsp;  Pretty good in the perspective....but I'm still worried about home. Well, I shall soon see I guess. It's my birthday on Monday, we're going to have a big party at the club near where I live (Mecena?? I think that's what it's called) If anyone's near there, drop by! We're going to have a little party at the appartment too...carlos says he's going to make me a cake. ^_^ I'm happy...and they're going to teach me how to make these really good chocolaty things, which I'm going to make back home.  &nbsp;  I'm going to have to find a place to put some of my pictures....  &nbsp;  Tcahu  -Hannah  ps. everyone, please, please stay safe.

      After all that complaining about brasil, and not getting my passport, and stuff...i´m homesick.:( It´s not fun. Thankfully, I´ve been kept busy.   The plane trip here was...bad. Not horrible, but I thought it would have been a lot better. In toronto, I met up with the other exchangers. I didn´t reconize them (they weren´t wearing their jackets) and they didñ´t come up to me. Fine. I guessed who they were in Miami, and found out, at least one of them was such a bitch!! Geez...Miami was the shocker. Nobody spoke english. We were expecting it in brasil of course, but Miami?!? Nope, english is a minority language. They speak spanish, or portuguese there...on the plane from my Miami to Sao Paulo, I sat next to the camel man. More about that when I get home. He didn~t shut up! Even when I fell asleep, I bet he was still talking. He asked for my e-mail be for we got off, so I gave him my old account, which I never check. *shrugs* Isn´t it a bit wierd, a 50 yr old asking for my e-mail? *shifty glance*   I´ve been here four days now and I haven´t been home to sleep before 1:30 am. My first day here, we went touring around florianopolis and then Maju and I went to a Festa de Juinia party at friend´s of Maju´s. All the guys (very cute, i might add) were teaching me english, and how to dance, and everyone was dressed up (it´s kind of like halloween, except people all dress up as peasants)....I had so much fun!   The next day we went to another Festa de Juinia party, this one in the counrty, about 40 minutes away, at her relatives place. After, Maju, Carlos and I went to see Shrek 2. They thought it was going to be dubed in portuguese, and subbed in english, or vise versa, but either way, it was~´t, and so I sat through the complete portuguese version of shrek. *grins* I must say, even with out hardly understanding a word, it was better then the first. After that, we went out for sushiu. Real sushi. I loved it! I didn´t realise how late everything´s open until here, until we got home at 2 am....@_@   The next day (yesterday) was a rotary BBQ, where I met all the other exchangers. (most of them long term) I mainly hung out with three australians, two americans, and a south african boy...I had so much fun with them (and finally, people who had english as a native language) after the BBQ, Maju and I went to another one of her friends, and we watched movies (in english, they had portuguese subs on)   Today, to my horror i slept in until 11am! We did some errands around the town, and then at 6pm went shopping. I bought a new pair of jeans, and a shirt as well. I still can't get over how cheap everything is here!!  I also got invited today to go to school for a couple hours with one of the girls I met yesterday. (She´s a brazilian girl, going to Mexico in august) I was so surprised to get the phone call, we exchanged phone numbers with several people yesterday, but I didn´t expect anyone to actually call me!   Anyway, it´s late here. I´m tired, and really homesick I think. I really mis all my friends, and Dime and my parents...I really wish I could go home, just for the night to see them, and give them all hugs.   I´m having fun here, but...it´s not the same with out them. It´s so overwhelming!   Anyway, I´ll write more soon.   Tchau!

      As soon as I returned to conciousness , I went to have a shower to get rid of the pain from surfing. Ah...whole house to myself. That's a first. Hehehe. Finally don't have to worry about someone else desperate to use the bathroom.  Luiz came back at about 10:30 and at 11am Matt phoned asking if I was indeed coming to Escola Tecnica today. Said yes, and that I'd see him in half an hour. Luiz drove me to the school and I got there 20mins early...hehe, takes much longer by bus. Met up with Nathan briefly who asked if I could get into the school okay (security) told him Matt was coming to get me, and he said something along the lines of, "Guy's got my fucking hat." Heh. So, to kill time, I went for a walk down the the bank to see if the ATM's there'd accept my card. I'm broke...only $16R left...So, it figures that they didn't accept my card so I wandered back 10 mins later and kept myself occupied with my Rubik's cube. Matt surprised me, and then surprised me even more when I saw it wasn't a baseball hat he'd stolen from Nathan, like I'd originally assumed, it was some sort of Cowboy hat...I think. LOL, cool.  The convo class was cool. Some South African chick named Pauline showed up, (not an exchanger, like a backpacker...sorta...well, not really. She's traveled a fair bit) and she was really interesting to talk to. Caught the bus home (I took a bus. By myself. And didn't get lost. Willeke! Aren't you so proud of me? hehehe)  Tried another bank before going home. Now only have $14.50 R left. Stupid bus fare. Ate lunch, wrote in my diary....chatted on MSN, then watched Gilmore Girls and Touched by an Angel. LOL, I can follow along now nearly. My eyes drift towards the titles (even though the show is in english) and I can normally managed to follow just by reading. I try and figure out what's being said before the actor actually says it. If that made any sense whatsoever...LOL.  Matt and I were supposed to be doing something tonight, but he came online saying that he was sorry and was going to go to bed instead. *blinks* Not even 6 yet. I asked him what's wrong but he said he was just tired. Hopefully that's only it...6...lol. Ah well. ^_^  So, it's just me, myself and I this evening....hm...what shall I do?  Dum dum dum....;-)  Beijos!

      Well, I went surfing...lol, I have the bruises to prove it. I only managed to stand up one time...yeah, that's embarrassing...I'm really bad at it. ;) LOL, and the one time I managed to stand up, when I fell off, I filled my lungs with salt water and wacked my foot on one of the fins.LOL, my foot is pretty shades of purple now. ^_^ I still had a great time, I hope I get to go again! (and maybe stayt upright on the board...hehehe)  Matt did phone, but grrr, we were so late getting to the beach that we would have had to leave right away. I didn't feel right bugging them aobut it, I mean, I was the one wanting to go surfing, and Limão and Victor were with us too, so it wouldn't have been fair for them. So yeah. While I'm writing this, Tom is on an airplane to back home. God that must be a scary feeling. He was lucky, he was here for a year. But at the same time, does that make it even harder to say goodbye? If so...wow, it could almost make me think twice about doing a long term exchange. LOL, Almost, but not quite. I'm definately going to apply for a long term...maybe even put Brasil as my first choice. I'd never get Florianópolis as my city assignment though...and I love it here. I don't know how I could live anywhere else.  Hehehe..yeah well...right now I'm writing an e-mail to Matt....must remember to phone up Bruna as well about going to school with them tomorrow. Otherwise, I won't be allowed through the gates. It's strange having guards at a school.  Neh, going to go...I'm so tired now. I guess that's what happens when only getting about 4 .5 hours of sleep in the past 3 days. ^_^ I had a good day today. Really good. I only wish I could have said good-bye to Tom. LOL...I mean, last time I saw him, he was drunk...@_@  Hehehe...hope my parents aren't reading this. ;)  Beijos!  Hannah

      My first day of school today. Hehehe....Now I understand what it must be like for people moving to our highschool back home. It's not easy. ^_^ Thankfully, I have Maju there, and yet at the same time, not having her there would teach me to be more independent...  Met up with Murilo and again. I haven't seen them since the Festa de Junina do on my first night in Brasil. LOL, Murilo taught me my first words (that were not of the 'hello' 'goodbye' 'thankyou' variety) He taught me lua cheia (full moon) and cachorro (dog)...lol,aren't you proud?  Got to leave school early because the teacher didn't show up for last class. Damn, why doesn't that happen in Canada? We walked home and I...thankfully got an e-mail from willeke. And ROBIN!! Yay....I miss my friends lol. A squirrel (apparently of the Foamy variety ( urlLink Click here  for more info....LOL  **Willeke: I know you read this, and Robin doesn't so, make sure to tell her (and maybe Paul too...LOL), that I know I complain and bitch a lot to you guys, but it's only because I need advice from you right away where as...all the good stuff that's happening here, it's a hundred thousand times better if I tell you in person. Typing...it's just to hard to explain that way.  Now! I'm going surfing! I'm so excited! I've always wanted to surf. Going with Carlos...not sure if anybody else is going. I don't think so. After I'm finished that, I'm going to go meet up with Matt, if he phones, at Cento terminal and take a bus with him to go down to the airport to say good-bye to Tom. It's a shame I didn't meet him more then a couple times....  Ugh, got to go. Have to go get changed.  Later days!

      I had a great time last night. Went to a goodbye Party for Tom. :-( Tried a whole bunch of new things...saw all the exchangers again...;-) We (Maju, Carlos and I) went to pick up Matt and went to a club/pub thing in Lagoa de Conceição, right across the street from where we all went for Mexican on wednesday. Go figure. ;-) Got there at shortly after midnight and met up with:   Steve:  An aussie I believe. Cool guy.  Fun to talk to. Hopefully see him again before I go home.  Bruna:  Brasilian. I've talked about Bruna before. She's uh...wow, cool is getting redundent.  Kate:  USA. Hyper girl! ;-) That never was a bad thing though.  Nathan:  Aussie...hehehe  Tom:  Hawaii. His going away party. :-( That sucks. I barely get a chance to know these people.  Rebecca:  USA. Tom's girlfriend??  Petra:  New Zealand. Hehehe, Petra's cool. Apparently she had to live with Kylee for 5 days as well....poor thing. ^_~  So yeah, we hung out there until 2ish, before heading off to some random part of the city. (No matter how many times someones tells me, I can't remember the name for the life of me)  Man...I got maybe 1/2 hour of sleep last night? Ugh...I don't know why I couldn't sleep. @_@ I'm so confused...grrr.....Robin, Willeke, or Paul (Zeke), where are you when I need to talk?? hehehe...Willeke, I really hope you at least come online soon, you lazy cow. ;) Finally, your word is doing some retaliation! Please, get out of bed (I know it's   only   quarter to eleven there...) *laughs*  But seriously....soon!  -Hannah
