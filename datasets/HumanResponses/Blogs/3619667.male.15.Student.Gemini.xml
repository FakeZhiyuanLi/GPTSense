      Aight... I really didn't do much to the song. However, I did take what little I did to improve it some odd months ago and turn it all into an mp3. The rythm guitar is now... better. I also added on to the little piano bit at the end, with some reverse guitar,organ recorder and the likes. No vocals, yet. I may make it longer in the future.  Now for some obligatory backround info. I litterally threw "Wizdeah" together for a friend's video game (which he rejected the original midi demo). So I took the song and made it better. The name was a rush of genious. Essentially me doing my "make up a word bit." This is a pretty complex process. A good word has a z in it. The "deah" is the double vowel combo that has too many pronounciations. It starts with a "W" which is the worst letter in the alphabet. And ends in "h" simply because.  Enjoy.

         Its frrriday. That means its update time. basically, all that was developed this week was the jpgs and wizedeah t3. Well, maybe soon or something we will have an actual page upon which you can see the cast members. This reminds me, lurker hunter, has joined the team. His best work to this day would be erk and sane, a fire emblem remix that if it isn't already up in the music section ,will be up there shortly. So far, we are working on more midis (duh!) and also there will be a page dedicated to chuckles, the near incompetent administrator that works at summer school, the likes of which lurker and I attend. And in other news: I will post wired photos like this every update day. Thereby marking something significant. Or not.

      The internet harbors some of the wierdest things on the planet. Besides this site, you may consider the internet to hold some type of sanity. Well, thats where you are wrong. The most random things pop up unexpectedly. For instance, do a google search for  urlLink waffles .Guess what the top link is? John Kerry.com. I still wonder what kind of person would serch for waffles and be looking for john kerry. Then it begs the question how many people looked for waffles and were trting to find john kerry. Is he a waffle or something? aside from the ugly face that most politicians have, he's pretty normal. What is the world comming to... (the answer is nothing, aka the other brain on this site is named confused destroyer of worlds)...

      I have to wake up at 7:00 this week. I'm not in summer school, but of course- the few  friends I have are all in summer school. I'm just as occupied with volunteer work and such.  Either way, I still can't find time to work on my album...   Update. I just finished the first song on my album. Yay. Only 99 more songs to go.

      I upgraded the site with cool stuff like media eventually, I will transfer all of the cool media i have on my compy at home, to a server so all of you can partake in the wierd stuff i have. This blog will be subject to strange things, including, but not limited to, IB humor, gaming jokes, random sprites, vague jokes that make no sense, wierd pictures, inuendo, and also light my teacher on fire pages. Thank you, and do not step on a squirel that shoots flames.

      Be it ever so humble, ect. I forgot to mention that I was teh dissapeared all week. Now I am back. I was at a church related camp up yonder and had the time-of-my-life. I am now tired and very itchy and eager to see mah lady (try being faithful for a week when you can have five women hanging off you at any given moment). It's back to the grind now: music, volunteer... sleep.  Next on the agenda: Let's find a purpose for this post. Everyone is gone their own ways, and I am just now -as of two minutes- missing DCI's 2nd round of shows in Orlando. On the topic of band, I might as well mention that I met a few band geeks like myself at camp. Pretty amazing, the whole band bond.  I will post more when I.

As anyone that knows me could tell you, my being bored is usually not a good thing. In other news, work is being done to bring you a massive attack 0 special event titled: "chuckles, Ignorance? Or Stupidity?" But more on that topic later. In local news, a cat wandering around near 436 was reported to have been  "Set on fire by that darn kid". Several unnamed people declined comment.

        Finally got power back to my house. Now I can continue to play FF7. And while on that subject, let's take a moment to wonder at what squaresoft was thinking when they made this game. "Hmmm, lets make really cool backrounds, but make all the main characters look like they escaped from a sega saturn."  I mean, really. What would anyone make the backrounds look 300 times better than the characters? That make no sense. But then again, maybe enix is the one that tells square that they are idiots. Lurker, you better not do what these genuises have done.  And now back to buisness. Media server status: Offline. Redoing all the images, Re-scripting page. Ready in like 6 days.

      I was gonna write something, but i deleted it. So what. Well, in news around the world, Oregon recently announced that they are trying to make it legal to carry 6 pounds of pot, for medicinal purposes. Skip a beat. What the hey. You know how much pot that is?  Enough to fill up 2 shopping carts. Two whole shopping carts.(Without the kid in it of course). Now Thats just crazy. 6 stupid pounds. Its illegal to have more than 2 ounces in any other state. (Cept califonia, there just wierd about drugs). Alright, now back to the normally schedualed update.   Hokay, this week we got off of our lazy butts and made a Holst  urlLink Upload  . And even a  urlLink New Song . And, the meta has been re done for this site. So, after we get crawled, all you have to search for is massiveattack0 and you will find this page. Aint that great?We Now bring you, electric avenue, by Eddy Grant  urlLink Electric Avenue

      Yeah. I'm still here. 've been work'n on some music, up'n the production quality and almost trying to assemble my prophetic 1st album that may never exist.  So... Been volunteering at the hospital. Great how I only need ten hours for the entire 10th grade. I now need -30 hours. Yay. Things have been up and down. Went to disney (almost always an up... *recalls marching in the christmas parade*).  Life is pretty... lacking... or not-as-good-as-it-could-be when Lucy (the greatest woman ever. Along with my mom and some other women that did historical stuff. Like... (which was the girl that liberated Africa from the Italians?)) disappears. However, I've been getting along with out her pretty face and keen-wit. I might as well confide that I saw this person that looked quite a bit like her. Then this guy kissed the girl who looks almost like Lucy but lacks that lovely-undertone and I nearly went up and punched him. *Random Anecdote*  And what's with FF7. Besides being the greatest RPG ever, having a great sound track, possessing a brilliant plot, featuring almost-ahead-of-it's-time effects and backrounds, and being the the greatest RPG ever... it was the greatest RPG ever? I really wasn't to bothered by the characters. I really prefer them to all this FFXII junk that is floating around. Although Cloud looks the freak'n awesome in Kingdom Hearts.  I've also been back in the knack for writing music. Did some cool stuff with guitar concerning effects. I also discovered how much you can compress a mix before even the quiet bell part at the beggining distorts your speakers. Then the overdriven part kicks in- I'll give you the distortion 101 later. Currently Working on a more orchestral/pianostral/ambient padesque..stral song. Having some fun with all my new Native Instruments (TM)...(or is it R?) and the classic Sampletank 2, which is all you need to live. OR DIE TRYING! Mahn that sounds like a cheap war movie.  Oh, almost forgot to rant:  SUMMER READING ASSIGNEMENTS!  Fun stuff.  Count of Monte Cristo  is a great book, even better when you have to write a reflection on a quote from the story every five pages you read... I've got 28/528ish. I'll be around, and I might even post something constructive someday. In the meantime... never stop dancing/prancing.

       Aight. I couldn't post what I wanted to in the "favorite music" section of my urlLink  profile . So here it is, at your expense.    Favorite Music:   Listen to everything. Currently favor a good deal of Hard/prog/pop-goth/soft rock and all sorts of bizzare electronica (trip-hop, IDM, trance, techno). Also, big fan of more classic contemporary and not-so-contemporary classic. Jazz always has a place there. Now I'm back to the "I listen to everything" stage. I try to write in equally as many genres. The playlist I listen to most often (during the summer) includes too much "Smashing Pumpkins," "Lemonheads," "Fountains of Wane," "They Might Be Giants," "Beatles," Billy Joel, "King Crimson," "Air," "The Clash" (bleah) and "Beck" (yeahbuddy!) and some other stuff including teh my originals. Now repeat that all in one breath.  &nbsp;   That's about it.

         Well, this would mean that i am back.  I didnt really put politics into this, i just took a moment to show you all some wierd internet political junk. And i think its quite balanced.(kery being gay, and bush using voodoo.)  And I have seen all i really wanna see of Mr. Moore. He likes to get things wrong and then call it a (truth documentary?). This aint the place to argue though.  I got back from sunny north georgia(like 5 mins from south carolina border) and would like to report that not only did i get georgia peaches, but also sweet tea.  ill develope the pictures later.  now back to chocobo breeding ...

      so joe, you have already brought politics into this place, congrats. &nbsp; now before you do or say anything else,&nbsp;i urgeyou to&nbsp;watch fareinhiet 9 11(sp...marr would kill) and see&nbsp;why, the whole time i have said the same thing, i don't care who kerry might be, anbody but bush.  &nbsp; but before you say something stupid (i assume you haven't seen it, and that you don't plan on it) it is not just soem political thing to do with getting bush out of office (where he belongs) and the movie is not just a set up. i know that many of democratic (wait.. just three...) views are against yours, but the republicans currently have alot more wrong with them, stuff that i really am tired of seeing. &nbsp; once again, i urge you to watch this movie, it will disturb you, as war does. But it is true, bush is a lying b*****d and should never have been the president. (he didn't win anyways...)

      I really believe that there is a lot wrong (corrupt, injust?) with Winter Park. Moral value doesn't seem to be too big (at least not as big as some pocket books). All the kids I've ever known whilst living here tend to develope the same and fall into, though unique, hateful cliches. I honestly think that should some of the same people I know, never have lived in Winter Park they would be different (more likeable?).  I've always lived outside of the tight winter park society. Gah, I'm so angry and depressed that I'm not even in the mood to complain about it (I almost wish some certain others where in the same mood---).
