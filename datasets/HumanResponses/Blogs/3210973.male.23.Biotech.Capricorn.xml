      Here's how it's going down. I need to reformat my hard drive(present tense). And having changed my views on software piracy since I first got this computer 2 years ago, I needed an alternative to using Frontpage(as I am unwilling to drop 3 digits on any piece of software). Being completely inept(because there are too many easier alternatives) at html and having no real desire to master it, this is the best thing there is. The ball is rolling.

      1  The wind was cold, and relentless. The dark sky was now tainted with a soft glow on the horizon. Within minutes, even at a modest 15 knots, the gleaming white structure grew rapidly. David huddled low to the floor of the boat aside his friends. He could see that they were scared. This wasn’t helping his nerves.  The engine was cut off by the driver as they neared the dock. The structure stood tall and bright against the dark night and steady on top of a slightly erratic ocean.	The boat aligned itself with the dock under the stress of multiple ropes. David got up with the rest of the “elite squad” and within minutes had broken through the entrance into the complex.  Six men, and two women against God knows how many. Their objective was to assassinate a ranking member of a fellow government agency; one that has veered away from legitimacy. The door assigned to David and his partner had a giant number five painted in white on it. The stairwell was secure, go time seconds away.  “Jim, I’ll go first and right.”  His partner nodded, and the signal was received via their radios. The door opened silently and quickly. The sight was somehow familiar. Each floor was an open  square with a giant hole in the center. The ocean at the bottom of the hole was tempered only by about a foot of glass. The walls and doors were all white, and light overwhelmed the interior from the high ceiling several floors up.  Jim stood steadily behind as David turned to signal a clear right side.  The bullet missed David’s face by inches as he dropped instinctively to the floor. The look on Jim’s face was one of pure shock. The walls were suddenly red with blood. David glanced at the origin of the shots but found nothing. He looked back and found his friend dead.  The alarm clock had been ringing for some time. David Liu awoke with a jolt and slammed his hand against the snooze button. It was Monday and he had 6 more minutes before the alarm would go off again.

       What a weekend!   I watched Fahrenheit 9/11 on Friday. Wow.  Then I spent ALL of Saturday eating or looking for a place to eat.  Then today, I went with someone to test drive a used Acura TL. And to cap it all off, we visited a Lexus dealership and I sat in every single Lexus except the GX and LX. Note: The LS interior is so leet it makes my heart skip beats every time I think about it. If you're ever bored, go to a Lexus dealership and sit in one.  It's a shame the weekend is over. It's even more of a shame that I am terrified of the things I need to do Monday morning at work.

So instead of seeing the barely compressed 2-3 MB picture, you'll see something with ~similar quality at less than 200 KB! W00T!! If you want to see the full size, full quality pics, email me or leave a comment.  Also, I don't expect that I will be updating this on Saturdays. I will be taking pictures but I will post them up over the course of the week.  **I would also like to point out that none of these pictures have been edited so far.

       Friday   You know that feeling you get when someone hits a grounder and you're first baseman, and you know all eyes and the ball are about to shift from the shortstop to you? The feeling you get when you wait an hour to get on an amusement park ride and you walk through the turnstiles onto the last platform. The feeling you get when you finally finally break through a mind numbingly disturbing stretch of standstill traffic and into a wide open road. That feeling?  It's Friday!

       dah! dah! w00t! and w00t!   During lab meeting today, I did something I was not supposed to do. I fell asleep. I blamed it at least partially on a headache but to be honest, I was completely befuddled by the presentation and the follow up lab review was just too much. This usually isn't a problem as I tend not be noticed being a lowly RA and all but what do you know. The big boss, I'm referring of course to the boss of my boss, turns around and asks me if I did something recently and only after asking for me twice and turning her head to see the shut eyes on my bowing head did I snap up unnaturally and respond yes only partially knowing the question.  The mail came yesterday with horrible news. Something known as an excise tax on my vehicle is suddenly due in less than a month.  525  dollars to be exact. I know I'm a noob when I say this but, @^%&$@%^$!  On the other hand, my camera came and I am now taking pictures liberally and posting them up sparingly as there is a limitation in storage capacity and none on film! The temporary site of my pictures is here:    urlLink http://dave.webyng.net/pics , I must warn you though, each picture is roughly 2M each. Also, I only have pictures of Bo and a plant at his place because it was there that I finally had access to the microdrive.   Also good news is the arrival of my copy of "My Life" by Clinton. I now have over 10000 pages of reading to do in my queue of 20 books. If that doesn't make me really cool, I don't know what will.

       Financial Accountability      I find it hilarious that these mass mail credit card invitations are even sent to me. It is true that I pay all my cards in a timely manner and am not prone to incur late charges but as all people who have ever talked to me about my finances will testify to without even so much as a blink, I am not to be trusted with credit cards.  Meanwhile, it's Tuesday, and it's 1:22PM. Why am I home? I went to sleep pretty late last night as a result of having a sloppy stomach/headache double combo punch kind of morning. And this morning, I wasn't exactly feeling great. So I called in sick for the second time in my life. What a week.

       Monday   As is customary with sick days, I am sick. I think it may have something to do with the steak I had last night at Applebees. It could also just be that it's Monday...and I tend to hate those.  Yesterday, we searched for a gym. The two that made the short list are both World Gym's(Dedham, and Waltham). The idea is simple. After quitting coke and fast food restuarants, the next logical step is to promote a regular physically challenging routine. Biking along the Charles is only possible when it's not raining and besides, that's just the legs. I plan on being able to dunk by years end. I need to work out just about everything I can to make that even remotely possible.  On another note. I won an ebay bid for a gmail account. I paid 1.04 and as most people tend to ask, let me pre-empt the question. I paid for it because I was afraid someone would take my preferred handle. Yes it's free, but as it's only in a testing phase, you have to acquire an invitation somehow in order to reserve the name you want. As it turned out, my preferred handle has just 5 characters and doesn't meet the requirements of a gmail handle anyway. So I had to pick something else which was okay. 1 gb of memory and the email address to end them all is definitely worth the price of tax on a DVD.

       9 more days   I expected traffic to be worst today than normal. Much to my delight, it was not. In fact, it was the best commute I've had all year. Both morning and afternoon! I wish the DNC could last forever.  Next Friday's the day. I'm heading out on a jet plane. Excited? Yes. Prepared? No.  I've had over a month now to become acclimated to the Canon 10D. I'm comfortable with it, but not quite competent. Sure enough, I'll be on full auto during most important shots.  As for the whole rest of the experience. What do I need to prepare for?  I want a dog. A beagle or a jrussell would be nice.

       D:   Originally, I was suppose to spend the afternoons of this week drawing up a possible itinerary for my trip. But as some of you may know from seeing me, this object that's been growing on my cheek has got me all worked up. So instead, I went to the doctor today and tomorrow morning, I am going to see a surgeon to have it looked at. I even had my first prescription filled today. Amazing. At least the doctor didn't freak me out and tell me she thought it could be skin cancer which I'm sure was at the back of her mind. The swiftness of her decision to get me the appointment for the next morning to see a specialist is quite disturbing. I'll get over it. I'm hoping it's just some cheek cells who like me so much they refuse to die. Oh wait, that's cancer. D:

       Thanks to Si      Larger pic:  urlLink http://dave.webyng.net/pics/16x12/juniedesatlarger.jpg   Si helped me out here(as in he did the whole thing) by taking a picture I took and modifying it with a program he had. I tried doing the same with elements but the magic wand kept messing up at the hair and after a half hour, I gave up.  I suppose I should've asked Junie if posting this up was okay. But then again, I've posted up pics of people before without their permission. D: GG.

       Lab Party      Larger Pic:  urlLink http://dave.webyng.net/pics/16x12/labparty1028x768.JPG   As much as I would love to spend my time taking pictures of beautiful naked women as some of you have suggested, I just don't quite yet have that kind of luxury. On Saturday, I went to the Yuan lab lab party where we went to a large house in Newton and drank lots of beer, while consuming lots of chicken, beef, salad(not me), salmon and other assorted foods. We even had a ~26 person game of mafia. I got nailed once by a water balloon, but I nailed my attacker twice. Also, only 3 lines of science were uttered between my boss and I. w00t!!

       It Speaks to Me   Sew this up with threads of reason and regret So I will not forget I will not forget How this felt one year six months ago I know I cannot forget I cannot forget  I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do Follow me there A beautiful somewhere A place that I can share with you... -Yellowcard, 1 Year 6 Months  I've fallen into a pattern. It goes something like this. I get out of work, get stuck in traffic on my way to the gym, become dysfunctional by the time I'm done with the gym, speed home, slouch onto chair with Frasier episodes and an unhealthy dinner. I then spend a ridiculous amount of energy thinking about things past, and as a result, become a bit sad and lose all motivation to do anything but sleep. I assure you, I will break out of this pattern and will resume my picture seeking ways soon. Wish me luck.

       Volleyball   Every Thursday, I play volleyball. It's a fun sport. It requires teamwork and trust and a lot of skill. Skill that comes naturally to some but takes a long time to refine. I love it. I love basketball too, but I can't seem to get a decent size game going anywhere. Tennis is great, but that requires a free court that usually doesn't exist on the nice warm days. Softball would be fun, if only I were a bigger man than I am*. Shame. I suppose playing a sport with strangers that encourages teamwork, requires a skill set, and promotes multi-tasking(thinking and acting on very short notice D:) is the best thing there is. GG. *long personal story  Oh and as for the picture of the day: I've decided that this is not possible. I have taken well over 1000 pictures with my Canon 10D. It's a blast. I play with it everyday, but I don't always come up with good stuff. I suppose a picture of the week would be a good alternative, but I've decided to just post them up as they come along. I can only take so many pictures of my room and roommates. I expect this weekend to be filled with wonderful sessions. And as for my story, yes it is twisted and disturbing, but so are a lot of things. :D It's almost Friday!
