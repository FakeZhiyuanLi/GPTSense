       I Shed so many tears and a layer of myself...im fresh..ready to keep going...Wrote some poetry, listened to some Laurn Hill. Just her words and her guitar. I wanna do that one day, and i even finished a book i was reading, . That's what i love about books, it puts you in a fantasy world and watch other ppl deal with there problems. I was reading a book by Eric Jerome Dickey..Titled Naughty or Nice. But yea ima make it...i even re-evaluated a friendship of 5 years :sniffle:...awww man i bet not start the tears again...i come back later on....still dealin with the stuff with Brice...its coo...it was...it was for the better i guess...

          im so sick..my stomach hurts and my head....i found out the truth...and it hurts really bad....so i'll leave it like that.....im back to my plan and this time im stickin with it   until im in college...i really dont care but thats just the pride talkin...i guess being around an older brother and other males taught me that....kinda bush it off and move to the next....but then again its like it still hurts....but im coo dont worry....i have a senior yr to enjoy and he has his freshmen yr in college to look forward too.... I think what hurt the most is when he said it shouldnt matter because hes leaving anyway...So i said true just make sure you call me to say bye when you leave. sighs*...I'm really confused on what kinda relationship we had and even after i asked him he still couldnt explain it...i asked him did he like me as a sister, girlfriend, buddy buddy, or&nbsp;associate....he said he doesnt know....its a mindboggling mixture.....(a mindboggling mixture wha the f does that mean)....he went on to say that he liked me as a girlfriend in the begining but now he gueses he doesnt like me like that. So i figured i can just stop calling him and leave my door open for when he needs his hair done....like just the fact that he didnt explain to me still if we were friends or not still leaves this unbarely hurt feeling...like i wanna still&nbsp;drill him with questions...&nbsp;but i dont want to feel like you know....i just need some time...i dont even know why it hurts like this...but whats done is done....i kinda wish i never said ne thing......
