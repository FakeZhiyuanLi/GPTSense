      Apparently everyone's a critic.  I decided to tell some of my 'friends' (and I will later explain why 'friends' is in quotation marks) about my blog and I get nothing but sarcastic remarks....but this was to be expected with this group.  Now on to why 'friends' goes into quotations....I need to clarify a few things.  I guess there are those (Jess, I'm looking in your direction) that think I use the term 'best friend' loosely, a little too loosely in fact.  Not sure what my thoughts are on it at this point in time.  But after a brief conversation, Jess and I came to the conclusion that there are levels of 'best friends.'  For instance:  Jess is my work, girl 'best friend.'  Kevin is my work, guy/gay 'best friend.'  You get the picture.  Yet please don't misunderstand, my intention is not to diminish their importance and significance in my life whatsoever.  It is just that for different aspects in our lives we need an all-star team, people who are the best in a particular area, I just choose to cover all of the bases.  In the future I will be more careful when referencing a 'friend' or acquaintance so as not to offend my critics.  However I will go on record as saying that I probably have more 'best friends' than friends, but then that doesn't make any sense because how would I know they were my best 'friend' if I had no one to compare them to, so I guess I have degrees of better, best, and bestest 'friends.'  Done and done.  Also I think it is important to remember that today is Ronald Reagan's birthday, although they've probably had to tell him countless times and each time is still a surprise. (sorry, poor joke I know)  So here's to one of the greatest presidents in the modern era....Happy Birthday Reagan!!    Oh and one last thing before I forget...Jess would like me to point out that she is my muse.  Without her I am nothing, however I in turn am Dr. Phil without all of the stupid sayings no one's ever heard before to her so I suppose we're even.  But Jess, I can't promise that you will be my muse for every posting.  There might be others that inspire me.  A good Lindsey/Janielle car story may trump you next time....so bring your A-game.

      So after much deliberation, I am publishing my first posting on my 'blogspot.'  The wacky thing about this is that I was inspired by none other than someone that I've never met before, but found highly amusing and with any luck will outdo in the witty category.  Even as I'm writing this I am feverishly emailing with some friends to see if it is acceptable to use their namesake for my own selfish purposes and for the amusement/ridicule of the masses.  It took a complete stranger to light a fire under my ass and finally commit my stories to print.  It's kind of like if you can't publish....start a blog.  I'm adding my daily postings to the list of things I must do everyday to maintain my life.  As I told my best friend the other day when we were talking about our lack of work ethic...  Me:  Is it sick that you and I have no desire to work? L:  No, not really....I think we should blame our parents because they didn't give us a work ethic Me:  Really?  Do you think that will work? L:  Yeah, it's totally their fault! Me:  Oh!  Well, I've always said that we ourselves are full-time jobs (cut to both of us being totally satisfied with this ricockulous answer and returning to our regularly scheduled programming)

      I am, by my nature, a polydenominational person. I drop into all churches and at various times have found just about every religious tradition "closer to the truth." In this society we have made it so incredibly difficult to have a relationship with God that doesn't somehow turn into a relationship between a bad child and a stern parent, or a slow child and a demanding parent, or a slacking, brutish teenager and an anxious parent, that most people have given up trying to have any kind of serious religious life.   Every once in a while, though, a work of art will make you feel like it would be fun to swim around in one or many of the great pools of faith. "Dead Man Walking" is a good example -- who wouldn't want to be the nun responsible for the vigorous redemption of scumbag Sean Penn? The movie made Christianity so toothsome, like sliding Jesus into a new Armani suit and a sexy haircut. And every once in awhile I meet a great and luminous character that is my ideal embodiment of spirituality and morality.    For me religion has always been about the interconnectedness of things and the importance of seemingly meaningless details and the yielding nature of true friendship, and how everything plays a part in recognizing a larger force and ultimate plan. There are always pitfalls and disasters, but these too play a part in the eventual logic of events.  I think this is what all people want from faith -- a feeling that the seemingly senseless indignities of life ultimately serve the higher purpose of educating the soul.  It is like life, when it all falls gracefully together into a whole that means more than the sum of its parts.

      I know that I promised to write in this thing everyday, but that proved to be more tedious than I had originally anticipated.  My apologies....I will make a greater effort in the future.  So a few days ago I got an IM from this guy that I used to know from the summer of my junior year in college....we used to talk almost every day and all of a sudden I just stopped returning his phone calls.  Now for those of you who know me, this is not uncharacteristic, in fact it is per my usual.  (It's not something I'm proud of, it just kind of happens and for those of you who know me best, you don't hold it against me)  Anyways, he IMs me to ask whatever happened to me and why I did what I did.....I offered him no real answers; which only further served to unsettle him.  By the end of our 45 minute conversation, more like him telling me his thoughts for 45 minutes, he told me how cold, unfeeling, and 'callous' I had been and that he hoped that I would one day look back on our conversation and realize how wrongly I had acted.......riiiiiiight, don't hold your breath.    But now the issue for me lies in the fact that I keep thinking about that conversation and how I was like John Malkovich in "Dangerous Liasons" telling Michelle Pfeifer that it was "beyond my control."  Perhaps it was beyond my control because I was genuinely unphased by my behavior and lack of reaction to him.  It is this very lack of a reaction that is becoming problematic to me......it's kind of twisted to remain unphased by another's obvious distress over a bad situation, yet blatantly refuse to help alleviate it.  I couldn't bring myself to do it.......I simply chose not to.  AND, here's the real kicker.....if I had it to do all over again I would have acted in exactly the same manner.  Sick.

      As we all know the dreaded Valentine's Day is rapidly approaching and for those of you that have someone for the holiday, great....if not, more power to you.  Hopefully the whole hoopla around it will one day dissipate.  Regardless, I digress......So  anyways, my dad asks me to get this one item for my mom that he had seen in a magazine and knows that he doesn't have access to in a store of his convenience.  Now the only place I know where to get heresaid item is in Beverly Hills....did I mention that I hate Beverly Hills??  Well I do.  It's a little overwhelming and I've learned that anything your little heart desires can probably be found at the Beverly Center with a lot less nonsense and obnoxious salespeople involved  (remember, they work in the store, you're buying from the store).....moving on.  So Lindsey and I venture into this parallel universe known as Beverly Hills and as we're driving down Rodeo Drive we see all of these flashes going off and cameras and people pressed up against the glass of one of the men's stores.  Of course it's a celebrity, but who?    I never like to gratify these ego-maniacs with a second glance, but to shut down multiple stores on Rodeo Drive takes some serious star-power.  I had to know who it was......So as we're approaching the store we realize that who ever it was is no longer there, but we see a crowd slowly gathering down the street at Dolce and Gabbana and of course we go and check it out.  As we're walking we hear chatter that it's Jay-Z.  Woo Hoo!!  I love him!  When we finally finsih our trek (in the over bearing winds) we find ourselves in front of the store with the masses waiting for the, now rumored, Jay-Z AND P Diddy to emerge.    I have now drawn this out long enough and I will no longer keep you in suspense....after about 20 minutes of gawking at NOTHING.....a Maybach rolls up with a Navigator.  (well we all know Diddy's gotta be there because who else rolls deep in a Maybach)  Farnsworth, I LOVE HIM, emerges from the car with a fuzzy cell phone and hurrys into the store.  By this time there is a HUGE crowd outside and everyone is growing impatient, slowly moving closer to the 500 lb. security guard that is keeping watch over the door keeping out the commoners.    Drum roll please............P Diddy, Jay-Z, and Farnsworth ALL emerge from D&G and are instantly mobbed...people are running into the streets, crowding around the Mabach....it was literally like in the movies.  Various tabloids and tourist are flashing pictures, screaming their names.  Now I am quite proud of my reaction to all of this drama.  Lindsey and I casually strolled down the other end of the street while the masses are running head-on into traffic and throwing themselves against the car.  Amateurs.  Now one would think that this would be an end to the day's excitment, but it promised so much more......Lindsey and I ate at our usual dining spot in BH, Trilussa.  (we're creatures of habit)  Of course we sit outside so as not to miss the opportunity of seeing any celebrity that should chance to stroll by.  As we're sitting there we see Farnsworth and another gentlemen walking towards our sidewalk table.  We have the urge to follow them (because he's not as well known) but of course we have to wait for our food to be served.  Within 20 minutes we see them both walking back the other way towards us again!!  They're talking heatedly and the other gentlemen is telling Farnsworth, who looks completely pissed off, that "everyone has their role, and this is your role!"  This is what I like to call, 'talking one down from the ledge.'  He was giving him a good 'ole fashion pep talk because no doubt they were combing the streets to find P Diddy 800 thread count sheets because the ones in his already $10,000/night penthouse were not up to his standards.    I think I could learn to like this place.......

       All morning I've been pretty much bored out of my mind, well this isn't really saying much because I could be in the middle of a rock concert and still be bored out of my mind because I have the attention span of a goldfish.....but I have been exceptionally bored so I decided to go against my better judgment and take personality tests.  The first one I took told me what personality disorders I suffer from most.  The #1 was schizoid.....riiiiiiiight.  Coming in a close second was Paranoid and last but certainly not least was narcissitic.  HAHAHAHAHA  Just what I wanted to hear....thanks for playing.  I should have stopped there, but my boredom got the better of me.  I then took a test to discern what movie I would be.....survey says:  Schindler's List.  How utterly depressing, I'm a black and white movie about the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime.  Fantastic.  Keep up the good work.  Next we have the famous leader test.....survey says:  Bill Clinton. It states that I have the ability to bend people's views and to be a social chameleon.  Greaaaaaaaaaat.  I should have quit while I was ahead.  I think my family will disown me for this last one, but how was I to know that 55 simple questions about myself would lead to such a deafening blow to my character.  Apparently the survey left out the part about being an adulterer/lying/cheating manipulator.  This does not bode well for me.  Maybe I'll take the test again later and lie if I have to....anything not to be compared to Clinton.    Highlight of my day today: lunch with Skittles at Gourmet 88

      I just took a personality test and although I'm usually opposed to such garbage and feel that it holds little truth....I think there just might be some truth to this one.  This is what it had to say about me......  The Priss Deliberate Brutal Love Dreamer (DBLDf)       Mature. Responsible. Aristocratic. Excuse me. The Priss.       Prisses are the smartest of all female types. You're highly perceptive, and confident in your judgements. You'd take brutal honesty over superficiality any time--your friends always know where they stand with you. You're completely unfake. Don't tell me that's not a word. You're also excellent at redirecting internal negative energy.       These facts indicate people are often intimidated by you. They also fall for you, hard. You have a distant, composed allure that many find irresistible. If only more of them lived up to your standards.  You were probably the last among your friends to have sex. And the first to pretend that you're pregnant. LOL. Though you're inclined to use sex as weapon, at least it's not as one of mass destruction. You're choosier than most about your partners. A supportive relationship is what you're really after. Whether you know it or not, you need something steady & long-term. And soothing.

      Yep, definitely can't figure out why my ramblings are posting 4 times.......still working on it.  My apologies.  How embarrassing that I even jack my blog up!    So I just read a gentlemen's blog that I regularly read and I saw that he has deleted all of its contents and archives.  Apparently it had cost him his job and the Canadian government was tracking his writing....weird.  He said how strange it is to have googled himself and found that he was listed 24,000+ times and then another gentlemen also took down his blog because he felt he was being stalked......but isn't that kind of to be expected if you display your life in explicit detail for all the world to see??  You knew what you were getting yourself into, but this is not to say that inquiring minds necessarily want to read about your grocery list and what you wore to work today either.  Just make sure it's interesting, entertaining...it doesn't even have to be profound or what I've found to be the cliche on here...political.    I watched one of the most beautiful movies that I have ever seen yesterday....What Dreams May Come.  Visually stunning, terrible reviews.....but stunning nonetheless.  I guess it's not exactly a pick-me-upper, I mean the story of a man dying in a car crash and then his wife taking her own life out of insurmountable grief, only to have her husband travel into the depths of hell to bring her to heaven......afterall, they were soulmates.    Soulmates and their existence is a question I have long asked myself.....I suppose I'll get it when it does/doesn't happen to me.  Although I don't necessarily believe that soulmates have to be individuals that we were/are romantically involved with, there might just be a magnificent connection.  A cosmic connection one might say.    In other news:  new Nora Jones album coming soon.  Hopefully I'll actually be able to listen to this one without too many bad memories coming rushing back to me.

      Dear L.A. Boys,    What was that, you don't sleep on sheets or in a bed, but on an air mattress??  Did I hear you correctly?? The excuse that it’s good for your back and good for your skin is being used as what I can see as none other than an embarrassing attempt at you trying to be witty….you should look into La Mer.  But then again, I’m sure you already know that, right??    Oh wait, wasn’t that your God-awful, white no less, H2 broken down on the side of the 405 with you standing on the side of the road frantically typing something into your blackberry, threatening to fire which ever servant doesn’t respond to your cry for help the quickest??  Maybe you could have just had the bimbo sitting next to you walk to the nearest service station and get you the special treatment you feel you so rightfully deserve because after all you paid for those implants…it’s the least she could do.    And Aspen…come on.  So you really can’t ski can you…..ohhhh, so sad.  Next time try Whistler.   Oh and Ivanka, she’s in Wharton precisely so she can aid Donald Jr. in running the family empire some day.  Oh I’m sorry, should I spell W-O-R-K for you.  Oh that’s right, forgive me, working isn’t floating off of your air mattress and into your broken down H2 that the steward brought around for you after Rosa made your morning omelet complete with 3 egg whites and no cheese so that you could hopefully appear sober enough for a late lunch at the Beverly Hills Hotel with your mother/father.    Imagine that, I have a brain, you’ve never really encountered that before have you… I’m an east coaster by birth, it comes with the territory. You can be safe in the knowledge that I’m not some 5’4, permed -out, Justin Timberlake loving fat girl who is sitting at home right now watching Ellen wishing that I too could someday be witty enough to mask my insecurities as well as she does.  I’ll cut this short now because you’ve got to go do your hair…isn’t Ashton supposed to meet you at White Lotus tonight??  He always runs late, so you’ve got time.  Wear your Paper Denims, Sevens are out.    Good luck finding the mother of your children.

      My response to the most superficial thing I have ever read in my life....you L.A. boys make me sick.  What he wrote:  Wow, thanks for all your responses. However, most of them are from really nice girls...that's good and all, but I'm looking for the real superficial ones...you know who you are...you go to Concorde, Avalon, White Lotus, Shelter...you've never in your life paid for a drink...that's what I'm looking for. Don't forget a pic. No pic, no reply. Thanks.  Hi, I'm looking for a terrific girl aged 21-29 who loves great looing guys and money. I want to buy her everything she wants. I want to take her out to expensive dinners. I want to take her to the Academy Awards (next year), and every other totally amazing party in Hollywood. Sure, sure, I'm only 25 years old...but I'm rich beyond your wildest imagination, and if I like that beautiful face of yours in your picture, as well as your poetic response, I will be sure to spend all my hard earned money on you. I'm not looking to get sex out of the deal...I just want to spoil you rotten, the way you deserve to be spoiled.   Me? I'm a stud - young, agressive, cocky, funny, charming, have all my teeth, drive a gas guzzling SUV, and can dance better than Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing.  So what are you waiting for? This is like hitting the lotto! It's like having Justin Timberlake bring you to your prom, minus having to fight w/ Cameron Diaz for his love and affection. Send your pic. Send it now. Don't be shy..and if you act now I'll throw in a free scuba diving lesson to prepare you for our trip to Tahiti.  Sincerely, The man of your dreams...  And now my response.....wait for it.....wait for it..........BAM!  I just had to respond to the most openly superficial person/thing I have ever read in my life.  Do you always go around soliciting the fact that you want a gold digger??  I hope you have the pre-nup drawn up already because she'll suck you dry and leave you crying in your Hollywood Hills mansion on your bed with the 800 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets.   But I would wager that my SUV guzzles more gas than yours, I don't go to the Concorde Club, I flew on the Concorde.  Oh and your Tahiti trip....you just don't vacation there, you spend a month or 2 there because you live that much of a life of leisure.     Maybe one day I'll introduce you to my high school friend Ivanka Trump....God, I hope she's doing well at Wharton right now, I'll have to call her and check in.     So do we take my 737 or yours.....I don't do Gulfstreams.   Signed,   more elitist than you'll ever be

      Conversation I had recently with Christopher  Princess: Let's take a walk so I can smoke a cigarette. me:  Sure, it's a such a beautiful day. (walking in minor silence) me:  Let's just keep walking until we can't walk anymore Princess:  Yeah, right...and who do you think would be the first one to stop. me:  certainly not me... Princess:  Woman, who's the runner here.... me:  Yeah, well who was the gym goer 5 months ago.  I rest my case.  In light of such evidence, I would be the first to stop walking.    In other news.   I made the colossal mistake of watching Newlyweds last night.  That's it!  I'm done.  I can't take it anymore.  Television is not supposed to make your head hurt.  I now understand why geniuses are overlooked in this world because the producers behind Jessica Simpson's show are making morons stars and making light of the fact that the public school system in Texas failed....failed miserably.  Apparently she believes that there are white pigs in Germany that produce Bratwurst because it's white. Riiiiiight.  It's just incredible to me that people like her continue to make millions and I don't care what anyone says...She is just plain, straight-up dumb.  I'm tired of the media outlets sugar coating her stupidity and vouching for her intelligence.  If you have to say it, chances are you're not too bright.  And yes Jessica, we are lauging AT you, not with you.  Oh and Jessica, you're no comedic genius...the only reason you're scoring any points is because these pathetic, over-sexed adolescent boys find you attractive therefore boosting your stock and forgiving you your stupidity.  I am not so forgiving.  I am no longer watching Newlyweds.  If you commit it to print it's a solemn vowel.    Oh and I almost forgot to share my most favorite thing that happened today.  My friend Andy posted a missed connection to me on Craig's List.  Now normally this wouldn't be the way to my heart, but I loved it!  Thanks Andy Gar. (payback for the Jackson comment)  I inherited my superstar qualities from you.  You give me my extra spitfireness.....  I also need to thank Andy for introducing me to the fun-filled world of Craig's List.  Now I know what you're thinking, that I'm the last person alive to learn about this and see it's value, but I think I rebeled against it for so long because I knew that once I got involved I would be hooked.  I was right!  I now spend my days reading blogs and Craig's List.  The way things are looking now, I'm not going to have time for work.

      Today, as is the case everyday, I spent a large portion of it reading random blogs and let me tell you...a lot of you have terribly interesting things to say.  There are even about seven of you I've even managed to bookmark.  Some people read the NY Times or the Wall Street Journal when they get to the office, I read blogs.  Ain't no shame.  One of them even keeps me up on current events.  Thanks Every Sandwich.  Now a trend that disturbs me among bloggers is unemployment.  I see all of these brilliant minds out there jobless and you're blogging for lack of a better activity to partake in....people, it is still possible to work and blog.  I am living proof.    I just emailed Christopher and told him how I didn't have time to check out the link he sent me before I left because I was too busy reading blogs...his response,  'Awesome.  You're my hero."  See, you too could have the adoration and admiration of your peers.  It's within your reach to have it all.  Perhaps you're thinking that blogging will lead to employment and you're hoping for that one shining moment when the right person will read your thoughts and think, 'Wow!  Now here's some raw and untapped talent.  Let's give them a book deal ladies and gentlemen.'  Right.  Wishful thinking.  I've heard it can happen, but not likely.  Sorry to thwart your dreams and rain on your parade.....but let's be real folks.    Perhaps you even feel as though blogging provides you with a sense of accomplishment and belonging to a large unseen network of people you have something in common with simply by virtue of the fact that you too are a blogger...it may even provide a sense of belonging.  Ummmmmm yeah, get a job.  I'm sure your parents want you to be gainfully employed as well.  Let's put that liberal arts education of yours to good use shall we?!?  Now my ramblings may offend some of you, but that's the beauty of this thing...I don't have to care because I am certain that there are those of you out there that whole-heartedly agree with me.  It's time for some tough love, it's time to get back on the horse and do something with your life.  Your unborn children thank me.

      It is that time again....I have found yet another personality test.  This time it tells you your "Geek Factor."   Survey says:  You are 6% geek   OK, so maybe you ain't a geek. You do, at least, show a bit of interest in the world around you. Either that, or you have enough of a sense of humor to pick some of the sillier answers on the test. Regardless, you're probably a pretty nifty, well-rounded person who gets along fine with people and can chat with just about anyone without fear of looking stupid or foolish or overly concerned with minutiae. God, I hate you.   So I was just called 'nifty.'  Of course I've been called worse, but perhaps they should have also inserted 'golly' in there as well.    Christopher, you can take this quiz at thudfactor.com and are our emails having a picnic theme today??

      Last night I made the mistake of watching 'Forever Eden.'  Now I should have known better because the show was clouded in secrecy, it involved 'paradise' with 12 beautiful strangers, and the real tell-tale sign that it is doomed for failure, FOX was the network that dreamed it all up.  Let's be honest folks, beautiful strangers was a term used terribly loosely here.  These people are 4's at best.  I think the real problem is that the networks are running out of morons to apply for their half-witted shows and frankly there just aren't enough people left willing to be the laughing stock of their home town.....not even in toothless Alabama.  My prognosis for Forever Eden:  TRASH!!  Hardly a plot, ugly people, stupid premise.  Show won't last.  Now on to Average Joe.  I half-heartedly followed this show, but from what I did see I was able to discern that while Larissa was beautiful, she was about as sharp as a marble.  I must admit I really thought the average joe was going to win this time.  Now of course Gil was gorgeous, but he too was less interesting than watching paint dry.  They deserved each other, that is until he freaked out on her for her ex-boyfriend having been Fabio.    Ok, whoa Chief....she's not with him anymore.  The guy's a joke and needs a haircut.  Why are you getting all bent out of shape??  Ladies and gentlemen, survey says:  He was looking for an out.  And she served it to him on a silver platter.  Done and done.  Bottom line for this show is that the ending was very unsatisfying....I wanted her secret to be that she had been harboring a child in the jungle the past few months or that she was formerly a man....something, anything but the fact that her ex-boyfriend was Fabio.  Shame on you NBC.  Leave that kind of garbage to FOX or the WBN.  Luckily you've still got The Apprentice going for you.    The only person who made out on this deal is Brian.....women will flock to him after Larissa dumped him.  He deserves better than her and I must say that his transformation was fantastic throughout the duration of the show.  Yay for stylists.  He would have made even the Fab 5 proud.

      Yet again, another personality test...I couldn't help myself.  Here's my 'life colors:'  You scored mainly in the Sky-Fire quadrant. This 'yellow' quadrant highlights the fire sign of your personality and your tendency to blaze across the sky like a comet, taking new ideas and concepts and trying to push them into action. You may well have a vivid imagination and enjoy constantly dreaming up new things to do. Because of your fire sign, you will probably push some of these ideas into action before you and others are ready. You may well be a persuasive person when discussing issues you passionately believe in. In these situations, many people may well be influenced by your apparent confidence.  People who map into this quadrant like to connect the future to the present. Your mind may constantly be exploring possibilities concerning where you are going and what you might do with your life. However, there are times when you could become over-enthusiastic and make decisions before you have fully thought about the ramifications. If anything, your mind might be focused on too many ideas at once. This may result in fewer successes, mainly because of your desire to get into action before you have completely done your homework.  For you there are unlikely to be too many problems. Of all the signs, yours describes someone who can turn a problem into an opportunity. Failure is unlikely to disturb you too much as you have a knack of being able to rebound from adversity.  Yep, that's definitely me....HAHAHAHAH

      The following is an email that I sent to Cukie regarding Friday night.....my thoughts aren't very organized or articulate, but neither were his.  And scene:  you know what, the more I thought about Dave's behavior, the more I got fired up about it.   a.  he wasn't invited to sit down with us b.  when he did sit down, he wasn't even a little entertaining and made NO effort to interact with us, he just did his inside jokes with Willy, who for the record skinned a sheep to make his jacket. c.  yes I know that it was a very touchy subject for him, but part of debating is listening to the other side, shutting up long enough to hear it and then accepting that you have agreed to disagree d.  I did NOT wait almost an hour to have dave sit down and ruin our dinner, well at least he did for me e.  yeah so he's unhappy, a lot of us are about a lot of things....but there is a time and a place for it.  Put on a smile and shut up about it for a brief moment. f.  granted it's a 2-way street, but his treatment of Lindsey right now is boarderline RIDICULOUS!  She's called him, if he has a problem with her just tell her.....it's a simple enough one to solve.  They are far too good of friends for this shit.   Now I know what you're going to say....but you have to admit that he was more than a little out of line.  I don't care if he was drunk and to point in Jess's face...come on, he knows better than that.   Right now I'm not a fan.

      The Oscars are hands down the single most self-indulgent exercise any one group of people could EVER endeavour to put on for themselves.  No one cares that you arrived in a Prius and were environmentally friendly because the line of Bentleys behind you just more than cancelled out your efforts. And besides, tomorrow you'll go back to driving your Range Rover and sitting in traffic for 2 hours on the 405 to get back to your Bel Air mansion....your good deeds are lost to most of us.  What statement were you trying to make again???  Also, please check your political views, rants/raves at the door.  It's not really the time or the place.  Sean Penn, I'm looking in your direction.  I like you, I think you're talented.....but you're receiving Hollywood's 'highest honor.'  Just leave well enough alone, thank your hoards of fans, your lovely wife that day in and day out puts up with your quirkiness and forgives the fact that you were at one point married to Madonna (no easy thing to overlook) and sit down.  You are now part of the Hollywood elite after being denied access to the club 3 times prior to last night.  Be grateful because the Oscar gods may never shine down upon you as brightly as they did last night....Applauding for Charlize, her speech was heartfelt, emotional....the people loved it and they love you.  Overall, just one complaint.  People, thank your fans.  We make your life possible.  We go see your movies, we buy the DVD's, thank us because without us you are nothing.

      Everyone, or at least most people have a core group of friends, The Breakfast Club as I like to call them.  Well in my case I am fortunate enough to be surrounded with larger than life characters....this is all fine and well until one day something/someone rocks the boat and drama ensues.  This is precisely what happened to me a few months ago......and I'd be lying if I told you that I didn't think about it everyday.  Sometimes people can surprise you and you realize that for having shared so much and given so much of yourself, you never really knew this person at all.  In your mind's eye they were the kind of person that had you known them at the tender age of 6, you would have carved their name in a tree alongside your own or you always thought they would be the friend that your own children would refer to as 'aunt' XXX minus the blood relation.    This is not always so.  Things happen.  People change, it's human nature.  It used to be a pleasant little kingdom.    I've been told on numerous occasions that love is never having to say you're sorry, but in actuality that is precisely what it is.....sometimes sorry is enough to alleviate the pain of any situation and sometimes, not even love is enough.    It was a pleasant little kingom, full of pleasant little things.  Lots of gardening and fixing, all very outdoors.  And in the driveway is a sports car I shouldn't have bought.....and if on occasion I think about you......I eliminate the thought.    I can't really say that I'm sorry........the castle needs repair and I never shed a tear.  What I am sorry for is that you'll have missed out on some of the best people you ever could have hoped to surround yourself with.....all for the life that you've envied for so long.  Good luck with that, you've sold your soul.

      Since I'm sure you are all on the edge of your seats waiting to know if I ever heard from Brian again or more importantly, Bill....here's the scoop.  I got an email from Brian regaling me with a story from the other night that I missed because I didn't wait with him while his car was brought around.  Apparently some rap artist really liked his tie or something...totally inconsequential.  He also added as a final note that he "hopes I had fun last night."  Nope!  Definitely didn't check that box on the survey afterwards.  On to more pressing issues.  Bill.  He did what I knew he would do.  He sent me an email in response to my voicemail.  He's done this ever since we went our separate ways.  I'd like to think it's because he doesn't know how to talk to me or deal with me because he has yet to reconcile his feelings for me.  The other part of me feels it's because he's an asshole plain and simple and could really care less.  So he emailed.  A one-liner signed Bill.  I proceed to write back that for some reason or another I knew that he would respond to me via email and proceed to tell him how I've been since the 6+ months it had been since we'd last spoken.  Now here's the rub:  In less than 2 minutes I receive an email saying 'she did write she knew that I would email her back...hahahaha' and proceeds to talk about some aveda hair product.  Well of course I got the wrong email so I write him back asking if the message was meant for me.  Obviously it wasn't because by the time I had written a two sentence email he had already responded, stating that the previous email had been meant for his friend John.  By this time I'm livid!!  He's talking about me!!  Now boys usually don't gossip like this or pass along superfluous information to friends about girls, but for some reason Bill had felt the need prior to that email to tell John that I had called him the previous night.  You ask why?  Answer:  Bill's unstable so there is no answer.  I must admit though that in some twisted fashion I'm a bit flattered that Bill felt that this was an important enough tidbit to tell John.  If it had meant nothing to him he wouldn't have mentioned it, right??  Am I wrong in thinking this?!  Also in his previous email he said that he would love to grab a drink with me next time I'm in Santa Monica if I'd like him to....of course I would, but just how much am I willing to put up with to get me to that point?!  When is enough, enough?  I've taken more than my fair share of a beating from this kid and yet I keep coming back for more.  I keep telling myself that in 3 years none of this will have mattered, but it's almost a year later and it still consumes me everyday.  I can't help but feel as though I'm being punished for something I never did...it's like I represent to him one of the unhappiest moments in his life.  Granted he lost 3 friends and 2 family members all within the span of less than a year, but that's not my fault.  All I ever wanted to do was help him.  Apparently he doesn't need my help.  Well fine.  But when do I stop offering it?  About 9 months ago when he freaked out on me and attacked everything that I believe in as a human being?  Probably.    Those of you who know me know that I over-analyze things and beat them to death.  But this one really bothered me because I'm nobody's fool.  I'm not here to be made a mockery of so I shoot back and email telling him that he was so busted and just for that he owed me a drink.  I make light of the situation because Bill's always been fragile.  I'm not here to drive him further away.  He then writes back again that I can give him all the shit I want, that he can take it.  I can just picture him in his office shrugging his shoulders and saying 'so what!'  It's kind of like tough, what are you going to do about it?!  The answer: nothing.  I either just accept that this is the way he's going to be or move on.    I know a few of you are reading this and rolling your eyes and wondering when the hell is she going to snap out of this, the kid's a jackass...you're right he is.  I can know that and I can tell you until the cows come home that he's different, that there's something special about him....you'll call me crazy.  I'll still know that I'm right.  It's an endless cycle.  For one reason or another, whether or not you choose to accept it, and I know that many of you have had your differences with him....I adore him.  I took him at face value, not for the dealings that any of you may have had with him in the past....because you know what, it's the past.  Let it go.  We all make mistakes.  Hell I'm probably making one right now, but that's for me to decide and not for you to judge.  We all make our own beds, let me lie in mine.  Oh and would you save the I-told-you-so's??  They're old and you're too old to be saying it.    For me, right now is enough.

      Last night marked my much anticipated evening out with Brian.  We were to meet at 8 o'clock sharp at the Four Seasons on Doheny, not Wilshire because as Brian said, the one on Wilshire is 'lame and for tourists.'   He said this was neutral ground after my having vetoed three of his previous suggestions.  I don't like the Sunset Strip, I make no apologies for that.....  So we get together, we're both a little early.  Oh I almost forgot!  On my way there, they for some reason or another had to divert the 10 E traffic onto the 10 W so westbound was virtually a parking lot...anyways, I'm sitting in traffic, listening to Jay-Z's Black album and this brand new Astin Martin DB7 pulls up next to me.  Now who should be in it but none other than Pierce Brosnan and his lovely wife!  Even Bond gets stuck in traffic.  Ok, back to my story....  I come into the bar/restaurant area and there he is in all his glory, perfectly tailored black suit, custom white dress shirt WITH cufflinks and a maroon and pink tie, he looks great!  He hugs me and gives me a kiss on the check, remarks on how much he likes my watch and we go from there just giving general information about ourselves.  Everything was fine except for the fact that he was like a little kid in that he had to stare and watch everyone that walked by our table.  So annoying and a total turn off.  I then proceed to tell him how rude that is and tell him to focus.  From my chair I was able to watch people hurrying by, but I noticed that all too often people would slow down and look at us as they walked past, trying I imagine, to get a glimpse of someone rich/famous/interesting. Instead, they got me -  but how were they to know that I was only in there for drinks with a friend? Answer: they weren't. All those people looking in thought that I was someone special, which I'm not. It's an interesting lesson on how society confers status onto people. I can understand how some crave fame and fortune, for I must admit that I too got a fair kick out of people looking at me and wondering who I was to be consorting with the agents to the likes of Eminem, Tom Cruise, and Charlize Theron.  I think I was the only person in the room who didn't know which studio or agency everyone else was working with/for.    Now for those of you who don't know, Brian is an agent to the stars.  He's caught up in the whole hollywood drama, but with good reason...he's made it his life to be a dealmaker so that we at home are entertained by the best of the best.  So we're enjoying our drinks and talking, but we're interrupted about every 10 minutes by someone else that he knows "in the business" and they're all so happy that the Oscars and award show season are over....well at least until June 4th.  How very awful for them!    To put this in terms that many of you can relate to, agents in L.A. are what investment bankers are to NYC....they're a different breed and terribly affected.  As Brian said, the only difference is that the 'I-bankers wear two button and single pleat suits, while the agents wear flat-front and 3 button suits.'  Really?  Is that the only real distinguising quality??  Gee, you know... I'd never thought of it in those terms before you self-righteous little twirp!   Your observations are astoundingly astute....riiiight.   I was always very intrigued by the glitterati and the fashionistas...not anymore.  I don't envy him his 14 hour days and constantly being told over the phone that he's worthless.  Well, maybe he is.....  Bottom line is that I am numb to last evening.  I have no other way of describing it.  I didn't have a grand time nor did I have a terrible time.  It was just time.  Not necessarily wasted time, but I'll just chalk it up to a learning experience.  Will we ever speak again??  Probably not.  Am I sad about this??  No.  He needs someone to be impressed with the contents of his blackberry and his ability to get you into The Whiskey because maybe, just maybe "Clooney will be there."    So we abruptly left, the valets brought around our cars, we said our goodbyes, I thanked him, he thanked me for driving 'all the way' to the westside and I left.....a little sad I might add.  Not sure why I felt that way but I just did.  On the way home something remarkable and completely unpremeditated happened.  I called Bill.  That's right, I finally did it.  At 10:15 I picked up the phone and called him wihtout even thinking.  He didn't pick up and I left him probably one of the most sincere messages I have ever left.  No joking, none of my usual antics, just a genuine interest in how he was doing and a sincere hope for him to call me back.  We'll see....  I won't hold my breath.

      Finally the post that had been published 3 times has been deleted, but now I will publish what got deleted once again for you all to see....that way today's post will make that much more sense to you.  It went as follows:   The Price of Beauty: One scratched cornea. No, it's true. It seems the beauty Gods have raised their prices. Me being in a hurry to apply mascara, jabbed it into my eye. Now I thought that I was fine, consulted with a bunch of people about it only to wake up Sunday morning with a swollen left eye. Not cool. I don't do well with eye afflictions in the first place, so this one is really freaking me out.   I have a doctor's appt. today and of course I'm expecting the worst that I have irreparably damaged my cornea, I will need a transplant before the week's out and if I don't receive one I am going to slowly loose my sight and am going to be unable to see my children grow up. Yep, it's just that bad.  Ok, well not really. I'm just a psycho. The upshot of all of this: I get to leave the office 3 hours early....on a Monday. There's always a silver lining, I just really had to dig for this one. Trust me, I'd almost rather stay here. Oh and another positive is that I am unable to apply eye make-up now, so I save myself another 5 minutes in the morning, that's 5 more minutes of glorious sleep....oh but that's right, since it feels like sandpaper rubbing on my eye, I'm unable to sleep!!   Ok, I'm building the bridge and I'll talk about more pleasant things. Ummmmm.....still thinking.   Oh, here's one for the masses....my brother's cat is OCD. Yep, I didn't stutter. Mozart is OCD and pulls his own fur out. HAHAHAHAAH. Since my reality is slowly becoming jaded after living in L.A. for 1.5 years, most people would take him to a pet therapist. However, Mozart lives in PA and no such resources are available to him. Luckily he's a persian and can stand to loose a little fur, but I feel sorry for the little thing. How does a cat become OCD??? I think they should take him to the pet psychic. And on that note....I'm done.   I'll keep you all posted about my eye as I'm sure it will keep you up nights.

      I thought I would give a status update on my first ever eye injury.  After a much anticipated doctor's visit, Dr. Linda Vu (pronounced like Woo) diagnosed the problem as me having irriated my eye and there being ever so slight scratches.  Treatment:  eye drops 3 times a day for a week.  Riiiiiight.  The thought makes me ill and you would think that I was a 4 year old with the way I carry on when the drops must be dropped.  Hopefully by the end of the week I'll have become accustomed to it and it won't be such a dramatic event.  Don't hold your breath.    Oh and I almost forgot, she also told me that my cornea is scarred from one time having had a mild case of pink eye and not treating it.  Wacky.    And as Christopher says "only you could create drama from Craig's List."  I will indeed make it another day.  Oh and for the record I would like to state that Brian (few of you are going to know who that is) said that my antics and drama queen like tendencies are and I quote "very cute."  See, someone appreciates my lunacy.    Today I filled out my first ever absentee ballot so that I could vote for my brother in an upcoming Pennsylvania election since I have yet to make CA my certifiable home.  You wanna know what's scary?? I had difficulties doing it and apparently since I've been taken off of the tax roll (yeah, don't ask...I don't know what it is either) I may not even be eligible to vote.  Another thing that is problematic is that when I was talking to my brother I told him that I was going to have to call him when I received the ballot so that he could tell me who to vote for.  Now that is scary!!  There are countries where people still die for the right to vote and here I sit not even abreast of the issues, being told who to vote for...but in all fairness, those who know me best know that with a check mark in the wrong box I could loose my happy home.  ;o)    That's all for now. I'm leaving the office soon.

      Tonight's the night.  Dave and I are finally getting together for drinks after two long months of phone tag, business trips, and I think just a general avoidance of each other. (well at least on my part)  Right now I'm not really feelin' it.  I'm going to go and go through the motions.  You think this horrible of me, I'm sure.  But I've got packing to do for Vegas, errands to run, bills to pay....it never ends.  It's just one of those things where I lost interest.  Kind of like that fuschia Trina Turk sweater you just have to have because it goes so well with your black DK poncho, only to loose interest in it a few months later because you got the cashmere fuschia sweater that you wanted originally.  (yep, I'm sick)  I think that it's best in these cases to hope for the best, expect the worst.  My fear is that I'm going to have to put a muzzle on him because he tends to talk.....a lot.  And by that I mean....a lot.  It's difficult to get a word in edge wise and he's so passionate about what he does that he just rambles.  I admire his voracity for the subject, we should all be so lucky as to love what we do....but curb it, for one night....please, I'm begging you.    I think that I'm destined to be alone.  I find the most minute details about people troublesome and I obsess over them until it's like they'd commited 1st degree murder and just can't focus on anything but my hang-up with whatever it is I'm hung up on.  A gentlemen that I work with told me today that the best advice he ever received was, 'never get married.' (this coming from a married man)  Perhaps there's some truth to this statement, however it's a bold one at best.    It's ok, I'm destined for greatness.  Like I once told someone, your life will stand out in tremendous ways....and I meant it.

Now this is not to say that in the future I will be this good, but for right now, I'm listening to my messages as I receive them.  So leave me a message.  I'll actually get it!

      As is usually the case, I always learn things when I'm out with Eugenia...little known truths are revealed.  We experienced three such truths on Saturday while watching the legions of pregnant women and small children parading by.... 1.  Everyone needs a nose. 2.  Her heart was in the right place. 3.  Never wear a tutu.  Now these are quite profound 'truths' one might say and more will be revealed in time....but for now some things must remain a mystery.  (i.e. the stories behind my truths)

      An Open Letter To Several  People:  Someday when I hear Nora Jones, I won't think of you.  Someday I won't be mad at you.  Someday I will travel back in time and get you that record you really want.  Someday I will leave the room before saying that one thing that completely pisses you off and ensures three days of silence.  Someday you won't be mad at me.  Someday when we run into each other I'll look amazingly good and you'll look like shit.  Someday we'll be able to talk to one another without the conversation dissolving into an acrimonious debate about nothing.  Someday I'll see you on TV and regret turning you down.  Someday I'll think of the way your hands looked when you danced and I'll smile.  Someday we'll be able to finish each other's sentences.  Someday I'll sell all of the letters you wrote me from Paris to a tabloid.  Someday we'll play hookey together.  Someday I'll be a character in your book.  Someday you'll wake up next to me and that will be enough.  Someday I'll wonder what your children look like.  Someday when I'm living in London I'll think I'll see you so I'll chase after you but I'll never quite catch up and I'll always wonder if you faked your death.  Someday I won't regret having met you.  Someday I'll thank God for having met you.  Someday you'll call out of the blue and we'll talk like no time has passed.  Someday I'll let you sleep on my couch and we'll lie awake, separately.  Someday I'll save the drama.  Someday you'll stop saying you're sorry.  Someday you'll say you're sorry and mean it.  Someday I'll forget you.  Someday we'll be together again.

      I just realized that I forgot to update you all on Dave.  Yep, that's pretty much all she wrote!  Not gonna happen, didn't find my soulmate in him....he's a good guy.  He'll make some woman a very nice neurotic husband some day, just not this young lady.  I don't think I'll be calling him again....is that bad??  Am I a terrible person??  I just don't want to waste his time and besides, he's moving back to NYC.  More importantly I don't want to waste my own time, why drag out something that will inevitably be pointless...and I know what you're thinking, why not be his friend.  Well here's why...because I can barely maintain the friendships that I currently have, that's why.  You guys know that I can hardly listen to voice mails let alone throw another person into the mix.  So there's the story on Dave.  Short and sweet.  I wish him the best.

      I know that I've been on a bit of a hiatus....but I truly have been keeping myself insanely busy.  However I knew that my blogging was long overdue when I had friends emailing me that I had no clue that they even ever read the thing, telling me that I needed to post.  So here it is, my insignificant ramblings on a few things.  First off I would like to say that never before in my life have I been prouder of Lindsey G Keegan.  She has finally taken the first steps in her road to quit smoking.  I believe she is now 5 days smoke free.  I always told her that my one wish for her was that she some day quit smoking.  Anyone who knows her knows how she loves her cigarettes....I think she'll learn to love the extra years of living more.  Last night she told me that she's really excited about "the glow" returning to her face.  I guess, and I never knew this, that smoking dulls your skin.  Ya learn something new everyday!  Keep up the good work sunshine, I'm pulling for you!  Next:  Happy Birthday Arianne!!  Even though I know she reads my blog and is yet another person requesting that I update it, I felt that I had to write a bit about her for all of those who have not had the privilege of knowing her.    Arianne is one of my oldest and dearest friends.  Our lives crossed paths at the tender age of 6 and we've been best friends ever since.  Last night I sent her a quick note telling her how much I admired and adored her.  You see, she's always and probably always will be my biggest fan.  She sees the greatness in everyone and has always realized my potential for greatness.  There's something to be said for that kind of devotion.  And for that alone I love her.  As I told her, I'm grateful for everything she's ever done for me, the person she's become, and for the person she will someday be.  I have been blessed with one of life's greatest gifts: a true friend.    Recently I've been terribly homesick because I'm going on my longest time ever of not seeing my family, but when things get especially unbearable I just think of all of our countless memories and suddenly whatever it was that was bothering me isn't so terrible.  It's probably been at least 10 years since we've lived within the mile that we once did, but it in no way has put a damper on our relationship.  In fact I think it has only strengthened our resolve to maintain our friendship.  I don't dwell on the fact that I see her twice a year (if that)....I just focus on the few short moments that we are able to steal here and there and be forever grateful for them.  If truth be told, I don't know when I'm going to see her again.  I just know that it can't come soon enough and our time together would never be long enough.  But on April 8th 2004 I wish you the happiest of birthdays and a life of love, prosperity, and happiness.  Remember I'm with you in spirit always.

      April 12th:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY SKITTLES      HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANDY!  Literally over the past week there has been at least one birthday everday and today is no exception.  Kevin is a whapping 38 going on 17 (seriously, the guy looks younger than me) and well Andy, he's 24 today.  Happy Happy Birthday to you both!!    So this weekend, Friday to be exact marked Flora's 24th Birthday.  As many of you are all too aware, Flora and I parted ways about 7 months ago.  I'll leave the details of the separation in the past.  However, that didn't stop her from sweeping everything under the rug and still inviting Lindsey (another leper in Flora's eyes) and me to her birthday gathering.  It wasn't in the slightest bit entertaining.  In fact it was downright painful.  Upon leaving I exclaimed to Lindsey and Eugenia, "I'm done...no really, this time I'm done.  That was terrible.  Our group of 'friends' is held together by at thread and I just can't do it anymore.'  Yep, it's just that dramatic.  Reagan was her normal charming, obnoxious self accompanied by her flavor of the week, Liam.  (cool guy...almost too good for her)  Then there's Pete, Flora's boyfriend who is an authority on everything.  I'm sure he wonders why CNN or MSNBC haven't called him up yet to be a correspondant/resident expert on all aspects of the universe.  Hey Pete, stick to the toy biz....we don't need you in entertainment/finance/or marketing!!  Is it just me or do others find it strange that Flora chose to surround herself with the very people that she despises and talks non-stop shit about on her birthday of all days?!  Was this a feeble attempt at trying to appear as though you'd won the popularity contest and we were all pleased as punch that you held us in such high regard so as to include us in your birthday celebration!??!  ENNNNNNNNNNNNN....WRONG!  You're a phony, a fake, a fraud!  I hope that when you got home that night and washed off your insane amounts of eye make-up (newsflash babe, the theme of the night was not Call Girl wannabes) and the rest of your caked on make-up that you realized, if only for a nano-second that none of us were there to celebrate you.  Hell I don't even know why I went, something to do I suppose.  But don't think for one second that it was for you.  I don't owe you that much.  You got us all there under false pretenses....we came for Eric and the countless others you had promised would make a guest appearance.  In the future, I'll call these people myself.  Lots less effort, lots less phoniness, and most importantly, you're not worth it!    The real drama of the weekend was my flat tire Friday night/Saturday morning.  I've never had to deal with car drama myself, so it should come as no surprise to any of you that this was about all I could take and of course freaked out.  I called my mom, she of course told me to call AAA.  What a novel idea!!  Why couldn't I think of that?!?  Apparently I'm not as good under pressure as I had originally believed myself to be.  Anyways, I made an appointment with the AAA people to come change my tire Saturday morning.  All was fine and well and I was able to go out without a heavy heart.  My state of euphoria was not to last.  Saturday morning roles around and the mechanic asks me in a really laid back way....'Do you have any enemies??!' I of course say no and ask why...well kids, the answer is that I had a broken off knife blade in my tire.  Some one had intentionally slashed it and to think my car was only parked outside of our house for 20 minutes tops at all the previous day.    Just great!  So thanks to Lindsey and her dad, I'm was off to Just Tires for a nice new round of tires.  Great!  Just how we all want to spend a thousand dollars.  But you may rest assured that all is well and order has been restored.  I look back on the whole incident now and laugh...well not quite all out laughing, but I'm no longer in maniac-mode.  Baby steps....

      They say we all lose 21 grams at the exact moment of our death... everyone. The weight of a stack of nickels. The weight of a chocolate bar. The weight of a hummingbird.  ---From 21 Grams  Do you ever wonder how you would react if suddenly you lost not one, but three of your very best friends??  Lately I've been pondering this question.  Sure it's easy to speculate and you hope that you would grieve like any 'rational' sane person would, but then I start to wonder if my sanity would be shattered and my life would be forever altered.    I've been fortunate enough to never really have to deal with death.  It's kind of like I've been shielded from it these short 24 years of life.  However, why is it that some are dealt such a terrible hand at so young of an age??  Is it because they're in some way special.  People have told me that God never gives us more than we can handle....so I say that I will not bend, I will not break in the face of overwhelming fear or adversity or grief.  Sometimes I feel like I would like to write a letter to the Minister of Happy Days and request that he/she send a few good days to some of my friends, one in particular....they shall remain nameless.  As bittersweet as it will be....he'll forever be a part of me, part of the story that I'll tell.  When I write a book one day, I'll devote a chapter of it to him....(however that could shrink with more experience)  I have never really believed in chance.  I think that everything happens for a reason.  I was meant on some cosmic level to meet Bill, to open my life as well as my heart to him.  There's a reason why I feel like everything has been shattered into a billion tiny pieces and left in a state of chaos.  There's a reason why it's taking me so long to mend from this....there's a reason why I feel that I won't ever completely mend.  This is not to say that he sucked the life out of me, let's just say that he took a piece of me with him, a locket of sorts....but instead of my picture inside or a lock of my hair, he has some of those tiny pieces.  I suppose I could always go and retrieve it, but I've still got so much to give.....I think I'll let him keep it and wear it as a badge of honor.  I'm hoping that somewhere down the road it will do him some good, perhaps even one day he'll thank me for it. And maybe, just maybe it will help ward off further harm and damage.  I know that at this point it's pointless to dwell on this topic, but has had quite an affect on me.  How is it possible for me to have such depth of feeling for someone who doesn't appreciate me for me.  We all need to find a good person who appreciates and values us for who we really are. If you find yourself not being yourself because your partner doesn't feel comfortable with it, or dulling the unique aspects of your personality so as not to threaten your partner, you really shouldn't be with them. You want someone who wants you to be you and wants the best of you to come out, and with whom the feeling is mutual. It seems so simple, but it's amazing how much undermining goes on in relationships when there is insecurity present.  *mental note, April 16th...almost a year to the day.

      Lately I haven't really felt like myself....it's not like I'm unhappy or anything torutred-soul like.  For once there's not that much drama involved.  It's something different.  I look at the elderly that walk in front of my car in the crosswalks and wonder what their lives may have been like, are they lonely, are they saddened that the greater part of there lives are over.  I then find myself, as I'm sitting at the Coffee Bean with Eugenia genuinely wishing that all those around me are happy, I mean really happy in the purest sense of the word.  I don't know these people from a hole in the wall, but I wish them happiness or at the very least a general feeling of good will.  Strange.  Now I'm not trying to make myself out to be a saint, because believe me, I'm the farthest thing from it.  But I really and truly believe that everyone is valuable and worthy of common decencies and respect.  So many times I think most of us get caught up in our own lives and personal dramas that we forget that there's a whole world out there that we'll never know because we couldn't see past our own noses.    I strive to be an expectional human being.  I surround myself with who I feel to be exceptional human beings.  Someone once told me that I wasn't worthy to meet a friend of theirs....I immediately thought to myself, how very sad for you that you don't want me to meet him.  I am so proud of each and every one of my friends and I love them all so dearly that I would be honored for the whole world to meet them.  I never want to have to tell my children about the people that I loved the most, I want them to see their greatness first hand.....be witness to individuals of exceptional character.  Granted they are not without their flaws, but who isn't.  I like to see my friends as an All-Star line-up of sorts.  Each person bringing something different to the table and adding value to my life.  Therefore why wouldn't I want to share them with the world??    My best friend for the greater part of my life, Arianne, leaves me the most lovely messages to wake up to in the morning.  I don't know how she does it, but she has this uncanny ability to say the right thing at the exact moment I needed to hear it.  As I said in a previous post, she's my biggest fan, my champion.  When she tells you to believe in who you are and that you're destined for greatness, you can't help but believe it because it's said with such whole-hearted conviction, how could you ever doubt it.  I think people like Arianne are sent into our lives as guardian angels, they uphold us at our weakest, loves us the most when we screw up, and forgive us our worst faults.  They're more than friends, it goes deeper than that.  She is a beautiful human being and without a doubt, I can say without faltering that she gives more to the world than she takes from it and will leave the world a better place for just having been in it.

      Come back, Lynn Keegan!  Lindsey's mom left yesterday and it was the saddest thing ever.  I came home from the office on Monday, tired, mildly pissed off, and hungry only to find that she had already made dinner for all of us!  What a great mom!  Usually all of us are running around getting take-out at 9PM just in time to watch Survivor or following American Idol, but Monday Lynn was right on cue.  I think I could get used to coming home and having dinner ready and the table all set up.....not only did she make us dinner, but while she was here she got our lives in order, well our bedrooms to be exact.  When Lindsey and I moved in things were just kind of put places so as to get them out of the way and both of us never really took the time almost a year later to put things in their proper places....now everything's perfect!  It looks like we've lived there for years, what a difference pictures make in small picture frames.  That's the ticket people, put your pictures in smaller frames, it's astounding how much better they'll look.  My dear dear friend Eugenia got the most amazing job ever in Marketing and she was told that it could never be done because she didn't have the experience.  I'm so proud of her!  I know she's struggling with her decision, but she made the right one for this stage of her life.  She's gotta think about her retirement, she'll have plenty of time to save the world when she's older and has got money in the bank.  Her aspirations were noble and I know her heart was in the right place, that's why I think all is well and that her decision was a good one.  She's got a good heart.    Best News Ever!  My brother won his election by a margin of 3-1.  He almost doubled the other candidates votes.  I'm so proud of him!  I spoke to him briefly after he had found out that he won last evening and I could just tell that he was trying his damnest to keep his cool but that inside he was bursting!  I knew he could do it....he just needed to have a little faith.  My parents had a celebration of sorts for him today.  I'd say this is definitely cause to celebrate.  I just can't express how happy I am for him.  Eugenia was sitting with me when my mom called and told me that he'd won and after I got off the phone she told me that she knew that it had to be good because she'd never seen an expression like that on my face before!  Congrats Maurice!!

      Since I somehow managed once again to post the same posting twice, I must now quickly write something in order to delete the duplicate post...make sense?  Great.  Such are the laws of blogger land.  Speaking of blogs, I've been reading a great deal of interesting ones lately.  It seems as though people's abilities to write are not as lacking as I had originally thought.  Some of you are really quite good and funny as hell.  Nice work.  If I knew how to post a link I would link y'all to some of my favorites, but since I'm not tech savy, I am just capable of the blogging basics.  Hopefully this will be enough for now.

      Christopher said it best, lately I've been 'waxing poetic.'  Therefore, all of this week I am going to make a stellar effort to make my blog more upbeat.  Afterall, we are the ones ultimately responsible for our own happiness.  Therefore for the next 7 days I am not going to complain about anything....well maybe except for the heat because it's going to be 106 degrees in L.A. today; which basically means I'm going to melt.    Oh and to all of you out there in Friendster land...you need to testimonialize me.  I am doing my best to write one for you all little by little and thank you to all who have written me one.  I love each and every one of them.    So I had a nice weekend.  Lindsey, Lynn, and I all went down to visit Becky in her new home.  It was beautiful, although not very Becky-like.  Somehow she seemed more suited for her home in Pasadena, but I'm sure she'll adjust.  We also went to South Coast Plaza.  Dream!    Tomorrow is my brother's election.  Everyone keep your fingers crossed for him.  I think he'll be victorious, but you never can tell.  Best of luck to him.  I don't think I've ever been prouder.  He's finally coming into his own and doing what makes him happy.  I voted via absentee ballot, every little vote helps.  Thought for this morning from the desk of Janielle....I think it takes a person of noble character to admit when they're lonely.

      I forgot to post a review of the latest movie that I've seen.  13 Going on 30.  So the critics seemed to all love it, I saw very few unfavorable reviews about it.  Jennifer Garner on the whole does a good job of playing a 13 year old...but I just know her as Sydney Bristow, CIA agent.  It seems out of character to see this ridiculously muscular back and legs dressed up in frilly Nanette Lepore and Ralph Lauren frocks.  It just doesn't look right...and Fendi purses???  Please.  Sydney likes her latex and leather and Gwen Steffani pink hair.  I guess I could be type-casting her now and pigeon-holing her....like all of my industry lingo??  You too could live in L.A. for 18 months and learn to speak like me.  Scary thought I know.  Overall, it's a cute movie.  Christopher just liked it because he got to gawk at Garner for 97 minutes. I think I may have even detected a little bit of drool out of the left  corner of his mouth...Don't quote me on that though since I was sitting on the left hand-side of him, I have no clue what was going on on the other side.  Perhaps the movie was a little too cookie-cutter and predictable at times.  Although she does get to live in a pink house, what a dream!  I won't say anymore...I don't want to ruin it for you!

      Has anyone else seen the Toyota commercial for the Sequoias...the one with all of the beautiful children and the children are saying things like "some day I'll be walking down the aisle" and then this other little boy says the killer of all comments, "Someday, I'll take my children to the same places my parents took me...."  I tear up every time I see it...I think I need to write to Toyota and tell them what a bang up job they did! Two thumbs up.  And yes, only me...well me and Lindsey cry at commercials.

      I keep hearing the line "being an adult is about getting over your childhood," that growing up and dealing with all of the issues that bogged us down growing up is like a right of passage.  Not so in my case.  I, unlike most people, had the fortunate experience of growing up in a loving, nurturing home where my parents set a pristine example.  I've always felt that my parents are a reflection of how people should be...yes they're kind, good, and just...but it's more than that.  It was never lip-service.  They truly embodied the qualities they wished to instill in my brother and me.  Of course we have our arguments and petty disagreements, but it would never get to the level where it would sever my ties with my family.  In the end they're all we've got.    Of course you could throw friends into this mix, but even then they too tend to disappoint at times...I'm not saying all, but some.  I know, I'm a cynic.  But I've been there, experienced it.  It's not fun.  I have yet to grasp how it's a learning experience as much as it may have been a lapse in judgment.  I believe that once you love someone you will always love them....it never dies, it just changes shape.  Yes, the feelings may not be as fervent or at the forefront of your mind, but at one point you found some value in this person.  They contributed to your life, whether it be good or bad, they have shaped, however small, the person you are today.  That's what I do when I become angry over a past friendship, I remember a handful of the good times and suddenly I remember why I involved myself with that person in the first place.  My mom used to always tell me that I would fixate on the bad because it's easier to remember the horrible things people have done to us rather than the good.  That statement stuck with me.  I didn't want to be bitter.  I wanted to see the best in people...still do.  But it's easier as a child, feelings aren't as complex, ignorance really is bliss.  Hence the importance of keeping your thoughts positive.  Every thought you have plants a seed in your subconscious and if they're negative, you're just contributing to your negative karma.  So you think, so shall you be.  I think as you get older it becomes more difficult to forgive and forget.  Of course it's a virture, but yeah so what.  So is patience, that too is lost on me.  Seriously though, when your best friend in 3rd grade hurts your feelings, it's not felt as accutely as a failed friendship at the age of 30 or even 25.  See, emotions become more complex and the various emotions are achieved at different levels for different people.

      I know I know...it's been awhile since I've last posted.  Things have happened, MANY things, things I never thought would happen again.  Actually you know what??  I take that back.  I'm not all that surprised.  I'll do my best to fill in the gaps.  This past weekend Eugenia and I went to San Simeon, aka Hearst Castle.  To those of you who don't know, Hearst Castle is located in what would be the equivalent of Kentucky....basically the middle of nowhere.  It's a quick 4 hour trip from L.A. (with no traffic of course)  I'd been wanting to go there for years, ever since I saw it on A&E.  The antiquties and art Hearst was able to accumulate are mind-blowing at best.  I saw statues that pre-dated Moses.  It was almost too much to grasp in such a short period of time.  3 tours in the span of about 7 hours was almost more than I could bear. The one gentlemen that was leading our tour even pointed out the fact that I looked like I had had enough...that he had seen me on other tours and that I had obviously reached my fill.    On the way there we decided to stop in Santa Barbara because I had never really seen the downtown area.  Beautiful.  Hippie central, but beautiful.  Great little shops, great restaurants, beautiful scenery.  I even managed to talk Eugenia into stopping there on the way back as well even after our little snag a few hours earlier.  For those of you who don't know Eugneia, she basically shouldn't have a license.  No really, she shouldn't.  She knows this.  Her driving leaves much to be desired and going against my better judgement, she drove us on our little adventure.  Even after Lindsey, the night before had begged me to drive, knowing that my driving skills FAR outweighed hers.  Nope, I was sick and wanted no part in driving, so Eugenia drove.  Never again.  On the way there we were lucky and only went off the road a few dozen times, but on the way back things got interesting.  We of course were listening to Norah, she got emotional about one of the songs (naturally) and was going 92MPH.  She happens to look in her rearview mirror and sees a cop with lights flashing.  Since she lives and operates in her own world, she thinks the sirens and flashing lights do not apply to her.  After a few minutes she realizes they really are for her and she pulls over.  The cop clocked her at 92 MPH, reckless driving in the state of Calfornia.  Now I'm sitting in the passenger side praying that she doesn't pull her usual attitude because I am fully aware that she has exceeded the speed limit by more than 30MPH and if the cop really wanted to be a prick he could have impounded the car.  Luckily he didn't, even though she gave him a complete attitude.  The best part was when he asked her why she was speeding and she said that she was "keeping up with traffic."  I almost died, well more ways than one when she said that...but only she would have the gaul to blurt that out in the face of a major offense.  So 15 minutes later and about $400 later, we're back on HWY 1 along the Pacific Ocean.    She of course starts speeding again and this is too much for me to bear.  I flip out and start yelling that there is no reason whatsoever to ever be driving that fast because A. if we hit anything we will surely die and B. she doesn't drive a Ferrari.  I make her pull over so that I can drive because at this point I just don't feel safe anymore.  She happily agrees because she has as migraine and needs to sleep anyways. (MAYBE SHE SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT SOONER!) Great.  Crisis averted.  I get to live a few more hours.  I managed to take some pictures of our little adventure.  I have one amazing photograph of a sunset that I took from the balcony of our hotel room.  I'm quite the photographer now.  Chris and I decided that my new occupation on my friendster profile is going to be Hippie/Photographer.  I think it's most fitting.  However, the pictures that we took of ourselves leave a lot to be desired.  Damn wind.  I think the wind wept at the sight of our outfits, but congratulated us on our hair.  Things could have been worse.   I tried to sleep with the doors open so that I could hear the ocean, but it just got too damn cold.  I think that is a sound that I would never grow tired of hearing...and the wind, I love the wind in my hair.  Although I regret it later when I'm throwing fits about the knots in it.  Eugenia had a hard time pulling me away from the balcony because I would just sit out there forever paralyzed by it all.  I find it ironic how one of my biggest fears in life is also one of the things that I find most beautiful and drawn to.

      Every little girl dreams of growing up and having the most beautiful wedding that the mind of a five year old can dream up...I of course had to go and be the exception to this rule.  I never fantasized about that dream wedding day, but instead panicked over the thought of leaving my parents because no one would ever pamper me or take care of me the way they had for so many years.  In a sense a part of me still feels this way.    Over the past few months, perhaps over the last year I have come to the conclusion that I will most likely elope.  I don't care if I have carrot or white chocolate lemon mousse cake, if I have pink or black bridesmaid's dresses, if you wear an updo or your hair down...I just don't care.  Weddings in my mind are one big lump of drama because everyone has their vision, the way things 'should' look...I just don't care.  I don't want to go through the effort.  No offense to my friends, but I'm not here to throw you all a six figure party, a party that at the end of the day I won't even remember.  Lindsey always told me that I would marry quickly, that I would meet that person and I would just know in an instant.  I tend to agree.  So then why spend a year planning a wedding??  Now I know that many if not all of you reading this are thinking, she's crazy, Janielle's wedding was going to be the party of the century, the kind that graces the pages of In Style or Town and Country.  Nope, I'm not crazy...I just feel that so many people stray from the true meaning of marriage and what a wedding should represent.  Will you regret it, you ask?  No.  What if your husband wants a wedding surrounded by family and friends?  Great, we'll throw a party.  However something tells me that he too will share my ideas...Would you do it and not tell your family/friends?  Never.  I don't mean elopement in the traditional sense of the word.  Of course my family would be there as well as my closest friends.  I want to be able to look at everyone and know that we share a story together, that each and every one of you has contributed to my life in a positive way...in a way that no one else has.    Such is my wish for myself.

      Every now and then I get on these kicks where I want to lose a large amount of weight, not that I really need to, I just want to....alright, I've become jaded out here in Hell-A.  Although to my credit it's not so much to look like everyone else, it's just an awareness that with my body frame, I could be a bit thinner.    The goal, as agreed upon by Lindsey and Eugenia is for all of us to lose 10 pounds.  How difficult can it be....then I'm sitting here remembering my fun-filled days as a 10 year old where if I wanted a cookie or a donut my father wouldn't only give me one, he'd give me 3 or as many as I wanted.  He denyed me nothing.  And yes, I know what you're thinking (Christopher I'm looking in your general direction) and amazingly enough I wasn't Superfudge and didn't weigh 300 pounds.  You could actually see my ribs through my shirts.  Daggers to my metabolism.  I greedily scarfed (how do you spell that word) them down and went skipping off to play.  God, what I wouldn't give to be able to eat like that again.  Now I feel guilty if I even find myself glancing at a cookie.  I've almost thoroughly convinced myself that I hate Crispy Creme, that they're too sweet and rich.....notice I said 'almost' convinced.  Humor me, I need it...I had a salad for lunch.  Back to the gym for me tonight...I need to make the most of that membership.

      I am always amazed by how small the world really and truly is....over the past week my life has mingled with two people that I don't even know.  I'm almost reluctant to explain how, but I'll do so regardless, against my better judgement.  There are two blogs that I read religiously, very different blogs.  I identify with each person in a unique way.  One lives in Canada, the other right here in my very backyard of L.A.  My favorite blog, the woman writing it, we'll call her 'Kerry' has been having this on-going drama with this guy at Coffee Bean...I read Craigslist religiously as well.  I have some kind of sick, twisted fascination with it all.  Anyways, I digress...well the other day I see that she has posted a missed connections for this man.  Now how in the hell else would I have known that if I didn't read her blog daily.  I knew exactly what she was talking about, I knew the story behind the story...much like a friend would know the situation.  It's sick, but I feel like I know this woman.   Then there's this other gentlemen, we'll call him 'Skylar' who is entirely self-loathing, opionionated, crazy smart, and outrageously funny. I check his blog about twice a day because he is constantly updating it.  Well I read it yesterday morning and he's blabbing about how he feels like he should have his own network and wonders if anyone reads his blog that could give him one...then he proceeds to mention how someone from Disney reads his blog twice a day...THAT'S ME!!!  THAT'S ME!!  He mentioned me!!  It's the little things people....  Ok, so I know I wasn't very eloquent just now...but it's strange how all of our lives are woven together.  It's like one gigantic friendster connection only you can see people beyond the three degrees. You may all make fun of me now because I am a gigantic dork!  Happy 80th Birthday Grandma!  I love you!

      Christopher and I went to Dalt's for lunch today. It was such a beautiful day that we both agreed to sit outside on the patio...gigantic mistake!  So it wasn't so windy as we were walking in, but once we got out on the patio it was a flippin' windstorm!  All of my hair was on the left side of my head and I kept asking Christopher if it was alright, of course he responded that it still looked fine, but guess what??  When I got back to the office it was a wreck.  Now of course we had the option of going back inside to sit, but that place is far too 'industry' to sit inside.  I'm not there to see and be seen.  Instead I chose to suck it up and sit with my head tilted to the left so that the ketchup wouldn't get in my hair...terrific!  Next time I'm going to suck it up and sit inside.  For those that don't know that I'm addicted to Craigslist, you would find the amount of time that I devote to that site unbelievable.  I just got Tiffany hooked, I broke her in with the 'Best of' for starters...since she's formerly from the Bay Area I have her reading the San Francisco board at the moment.  I'll wean her on to Los Angeles.  Although I must say that recently the quality of the posts have gone down and the number of racial slurs is alarmingly high.  Do people really think like this??  I pray to God that they don't....people are just too bitter, but it makes for interesting afternoon reading.  I'm starting to think that most of the posts are fake.  But some of that stuff is just too crazy not to be true.  I am happy to report that I have yet to cry today, nor have I felt the urge to either.  Oh and this is entertaining as well...I received a phone call from Keegan this morning at 7:53 telling me not to be alarmed that she wasn't in the house...where was she you might ask?  Look no further than the LBC.

      This past weekend I went to my friend Jose's birthday party...I hadn't seen him in a good three months and I had forgotten how damn cute that boy is, but do NOT get all excited for me just yet because Jose is yet another one of my gay friends.  You might say one of the highlights of the evening was Morissey coming into the bar and a lesbian hitting on me, not exactly the first lesbian to do so, but certainly the first one to grab on to me and ask me if I was sure that I wasn't gay.  For the record I am not.  Besides, I now have my brother's, what I hope to be, brilliant political career to bear in mind and he of course is a republican.  I can't very well go ruining his life.    Lindsey had a BBQ on Memorial Day at the house before it gets demolished.  Good times were had by all and LGK was yet again placed in the most precarious position of 4 men all vying for the opportunity to spend the night with her.  Amazingly enough she managed to escape with minimal drama and a handful of drunken phone calls.  I will reserve any further comment.    Lately Lindsey and I have been discussing the amount of times per day that we cry.  It is exceedingly high when compared to those around us.  On Friday and Saturday I was unable to go out because I knew that I wasn't emotionally stable enough to handle an evening out.  I find myself on the verge of tears constantly....is that weird?  Everyone I talk to thinks so.  What is my problem?  I need to get a grip, I just don't know what to grip.  Not only does TV and movies make me cry, but I can be driving and all of a sudden my eyes will well up with tears.  Like I said...NOT NORMAL.  Maybe it's just a phase that I'm going through, maybe I need to let go of some things that are bothering me...maybe just maybe I need closure.  Yeah, that's it.  I need closure.    Eugenia made a very interesting point the other day at the Bean...I have a better life than 99.99% of the human race...in the grand scheme of things I have nothing to be unhappy about and everything in the world to be grateful for.  She is absolutely correct.  I have the luxury of being able to sweat the small stuff.  But what if you know, I mean you really just know that it's not really a small issue and if you let it go it will follow you for the rest of your life.  Perhaps it won't be as prevalent in your mind, but it will always haunt you.  Do you do everything in your power to rectify the situation or do you just shut up and deal.  Eleanor Roosevelt said that we should all do something every day that scares us.  I think I might just take her up on that...today I did something that scared me.  I'll take baby-steps to the one thing that will terrify me.

      I just finished watching President Reagan's funeral through a live broadcast on my computer.  It's a bit surreal to see that many leaders and former presidents all congregated in one place, it's rather moving actually.  One of the few times where everyone's differences and political affiliations are put aside.  I think all of us lost it when Bush Sr. started crying.  And of course once again Nancy was the epitome of class and grace.  I envy her composure.  I lose it every time I see her rest her head on his coffin...I think all of us can agree that we hope and pray that one day, someone loves us that much.  Yesterday when I was in the bank waiting in line I was watching the replay of President Bush and Laura going in to the Rotunda to pay their respects and President Bush smoothing out the flag of his coffin like Nancy had previously done.  Great, I then became the girl standing in line with tears in her eyes, that gets me every time.  I had to put my sunglasses on and then realized that was stupid.  However I will state that I am sick and tired of all of these liberals blaming Reagan for the spread of AIDS and the allowance of it to become an epidemic.  No one man is responsible for it.  It sickens me that in his death, people could not muster up the honor and respect that his office commanded.  I'm sure that when President Clinton dies, people won't be standing in the streets spouting off garbage about how he was a womanizer...no, of course not.  He'll be remembered as one of the most beloved presidents in the history of the United States.  Reagan will be remembered as one such president.  My mom told me the other day that President Reagan wouldn't even set foot in the Oval Office unless he was wearing a suit because he felt that the office deserved that kind of respect.  President Reagan was an honorable man.  An asset to this country.  He will be missed.

      All is well that ends well.  Meeting went off without a hitch.  Ivy really seemed to like me, she felt I was articulate and insightful.  We seemed to see eye to eye on many of the topics.  Yay!  I have a meeting scheduled with her in the next few weeks to talk about ideas/concerns for the project.  I'm the best!  Although lunch was a little lacking therefore I'm ditching out of here earlier than planned so I can eat!

      I'm going home tomorrow!  I'm going home tomorrow!!  Have I packed yet, nope!  Do I have anything done yet, nope!  But I'm still going home tomorrow!!!!    For those of you who were worried, I'm feeling much better today.  Except I have this lunch meeting in 30 minutes that I'm dreading because I get to face my former team that I despise now and well I guess if we're being fair, they're not really a fan of me either.  So this meeting will basically be a re-enactment of Westside Story minus the sponteous breaking into song.  Ick.  Is it 1 yet??  In 90 minutes it will all be over.  However the good news is that the two people that I was dreading seeing most will not be in attendance.  See, good things really do happen to good people...sometimes.  I'll let you know how it goes.

      Last evening I'm on the phone with my mom, I get a beep...I click over, only because I thought it was Keegan, only to have it be Flora's voice blaring into my ear requesting to speak to Lindsey.  I curtly say she's not home yet.  Flora proceeds to make small talk with me for a good ten minutes.  Now let me remind you all, in case you'd forgotten that FLORA AND I DO NOT SPEAK!!!    So we're chattin' it up and she asks how I'm doing, I proceed to tell her how I'm going home for 10 days, I conveniently leave out the part about my trip to San Francisco as soon as I get back because I want Bill to know before the town crier does.  Anyways...she asks when I'm leaving because it's 'just been so long since we've all gotten together and she feels like such a jerk for neglecting all of her Pasadena friends because she is just SOOOO busy going back and forth from Marina Del Rey.'  Right.  After her speel is through I tell her Friday, she says that that's a bummer because she wanted to see if I wanted to get together before she went to Santa Barbara for the weekend to help her grandparents with some greek festival.  Great, I don't give a shit.  She is laboring under the assumption that I still care about what goes on in her life.  Hell, I should be ashamed of myself for even wasting valuable blogger server space on talking about her, but it's the best I can come up with at the moment.    Now let me also spell out a glaringly obvious point...I have not seen her since April 16, in fact I haven't seen her since I last saw Bill.  Another obvious point is that she has not asked me to do anything with her directly since October 9th of 2003.  She now goes through Keegan if she wishes to communicate with any of us.  Nothing lost on that one.    So by this time my mom has for sure hung up, Eugenia is outside waiting for me to go to Bodega and I have a headache from Flora's terribly loud voice.  She went over the checklist of course...we talked about Nigel, Carla, Chris, Andy, Pete, and of course Lindsey.  I set her straight on any and all mis-stated 'facts' that she had somehow managed to wrangle up over the past couple of weeks.  She was off base on a lot of them.  Also she mentioned at the very beginning that she ran into Eugenia at the Ritz and she appeared to be on some sort of date.  I lied and said Eugenia hadn't mentioned it.  Hell, I knew the whole story less than 12 hours after it happened.  However, Flora does not need to know that I wasted valuable time talking about her blatant snub of one of my closest friends.  She needs to get her fill of the "Breakfast Club" so she can at least still pretend, i.e. lie to her self and perhaps even convince herself that she's still a part of it or if she ever really was a part of it.  She proceeds, and here's the kicker folks, to tell me to tell my parents 'hello and to give them her best.'  I coldly reply, 'yeah, I'll be sure and do that.'  HAHAHAHA  What a loser.  I don't have time for this BS.  Life's too short and there's a Laker game on, of which I was not in attendance.  Still crying over that one.    Conversation finally ends and I bolt out the door telling Lindsey that I'll tell her the long, drawn out saga when she gets to Bodega.  Kids, the night just proceeded to go downhill from there.  Can't even type about it.  Might have one of the worst headaches of my life right now.

      So much happened this weekend I don't really even know where to begin.  I guess I'll take it from the top.  Friday night I went out with Andy, Chris, and Nigel to West Hollywood (or Hairdresser Hollywood as Nigel so lovingly coined it) We went to The Belmont, great place, lots of beautiful people, men were a bit Ryan Secrest-y.  Good drinks, good food, overall good time...that is until the inevitable happened and Nigel did his usual drunk routine.  We proceeded to leave that bar and make one more stop before going home because of course Nigel became a baby and of course he had to go home so he could call his high school teacher.  Wacky.  Not worth talking about any further than that, really.    So we go to this other bar and Nigel decides that this is the appropriate time to lay in to me about his feelings or lack-thereof for me and mine for him.  I should have walked away then but of course didn't.  He proceeds to tell me that although I'm a good person, I could be better, that I'm a pretty girl, but could be a better person and that we all have this five year window in which to change our ways and if we don't do it then, we'll never do it because it's that much harder to change once that five year window closes.    As I'm trying not to laugh and giving him a blank stare, I ask him what exactly he feels needs to change...his answer ladies and gentlemen and I quote: 'If you don't already know, I'm afraid I can't help you.'  Thanks Nig, I always knew that I could count on you to help me when times get tough!  The conversation only proceeds to go downhill from there.  I'm proud of myself for maintaining my composure and for those who witnessed it, they too felt that I was trying to be the rational one in the bunch.  I kept my mouth shut (for once) didn't get emotional, and basically just let it roll off my back and chalked it up to another one of Nigel's sermons on how he is so much more evolved then the rest of us.  Next.  Saturday morning I was very proud of myself because I got up and went to the gym and did my full work-out.  As the day progressed I was a little hesitant to go out that night, but when it got down to the wire, Keegan and I stepped up to the plate and rallied.  As she said, the ship is sailing on our youth, let's make the most of it!  Yes kids, we went to Beverly Hills to this really low-key bar.  We loved it!  Great people, great drinks.    So Keegan and I always complain that we never meet anyone...well that all changed Saturday night.  We met Nick.  Nick who proved yet again it's a small small world.  His best friend growing up is one of our good friends from Bucknell.  Madness!    The only way that I can describe Nick is have you ever seen someone that you just know is well-off, not because they were pretentious or flagrant about their wealth, but they just have this air about them?  Well, Nick had this air..as well as a pretty face.  Best of all he was able to withstand my sarcasm, not only did he withstand it, he appreciated it!!  Major points for him.  So we all talked on and off for the rest of the evening.  Nigel of course left in a half-drunken stupor.  My apologies for all of those on the 10 and 110 freeways around midnight on Saturday.  Be thankful he didn't hit you.  Yeah, so we'll see where this goes with Nick.  Probably not far because he couldn't even divulge to me his last name, but we'll see...  Now my big day was Sunday.  First I had Timmy's 4th birthday party...fun, fun.  I miss that family.  They're good people.  Then....the LAKER'S GAME!!  Kevin and I had fantastic seats, 2 rows in front of Arnold and his family.  He's much more attractive in person then on T.V.  Saw tons of celebs...terrible terrible showing from the Lakers.  I still can't believe we lost.  It's the first time that I've ever been in attendance for a game and the Lakers actually lost.  Amazing experience though.  We did however have the unfortunate luck of having a Piston's fan directly in front of us...the only reason that it was quasi-forgiveable was because the guy was hot.  Kevin and I both agreed on that one.  Not that I'm a die hard Laker fan, but he had some nerve showing his face in the Staples Center wearing a Piston's jersey.  He could have gotten himself killed.  But oh how the L.A. fans are such fairweather fans...there was about two minutes left on the clock and we were down by 8.  If one looked around the place you would have thought that the game had been over with for over an hour because all of the fans had booked it to the parking lot so as to avoid traffic.  WAY TO SUPPORT YOUR TEAM PEOPLE!!!  CHEERS TO YOU!!  My God, you probably payed $1,000 for your seat and $100 for a few luke warm beers, at least stay the whole time.  On a more depressing note, former President Reagan died this weekend.  I think Democrats and Republicans alike can agree that Reagan was one of the greatest presidents in the history of the United States.  He was the eternal optimist and president for the greater part of my childhood.  I grew up in the Reagan years, his administration marked a turning point for the U.S.  We are the great nation we are today due in large part to many of Reagan's policies.  My condolences and best wishes to his family.

      Well, I did it.  I called him.  I did the right thing and called him to wish him a happy birthday. I purposely didn't conference all of you in ahead of time because I knew you all would veto it.  So there!  (how very grown up of me)  Was he grateful, you ask?  Didn't appear to be.   In point of fact, he seemed like he had no clue who it was when he answered the phone, even though I know without a shadow of a doubt that my number is in his phone and my name appeared on the screen when I called him...he didn't have to pick up.  In fact, I had previously prepared myself to leave a message so when he actually picked up I was thrown for quite a loop.    We made small talk for awhile, I asked him how his job was, he rambled for a few useless seconds, I of course listened, tried to get a word in edge-wise...but alas, it was not to be.  Made no reference to my unanswered email.  Finally he asked me how I was, I gave an abbreviated, generic answer because I knew he was only asking to be polite and I once again wished him a happy birthday.  He thanked me for calling.  I told him that Kevin and I were going to be in San Francisco the weekend of the 25th and perhaps we could get together for a drink...his answer "yeah, sure...give me a call when you get here."  We'll see just how willing he is to have that drink.  I have the gut feeling that something will 'come up.'  But for right now I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt.  Now I know all of you are reading this thinking, my God...WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS GIRL, this guy is CLEARLY an asshole.  You would be correct in that statement.  Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment.  Maybe I know he's better than what he's projecting right now.  Maybe I know that deep down he was grateful for my call, that I didn't forget, that after everything I still thought enough of him to call him on his 25th birthday.  My that sounds old, doesn't it?!?    My thoughts on this matter can be summed up with the following:  People that need you, but don't know how to love you...will only hate you for insisiting on loving them.  Think about it, it's true.  We've all done it.

      "I thought we were hairdressers, not tough guys..."  Best quote EVER from my new favorite show Blowout.  I adore Jonathan and if it weren't for his haircuts costing $700-$800, you bet I'd have him cut these tresses...yes folks, even I have some limits, very few, but some.  I keep telling Keegan that we've got to keep going to Backstage because that's where his stylists hang out...I need to catch a glimpse of them.  Afterall, it's my new favorite show!  Ok so are you ready?!?!  Picture it:  I'm running through O'Hare Airport yesterday with maybe 7 minutes in which to catch a flight, I get on only to find that some woman is sitting in MY seat!  Great!  I find the flight attendant...there is one seat open in the section next to a rather tall man.  I don't really notice who this man is...well I will not keep you waiting.  I sat next to Vince Vaughn for, get this...4 Hours and 22 Minutes!!!!  Yep!  However, now I think he's the best thing ever, but at the time I was annoyed that he wouldn't stop bouncing his leg, even after I had ever so politely asked him to stop.  We chit chatted a bit and the cutest thing ever happened...this mother and her son came up and asked him for an autograph. He happily obliged them (much to my surprise) Also another hilarious point of note, there was so much traffic coming up through first class that the flight attendant had to ask that those passengers in the main cabin not use the first class bathroom.  We had people parading up through there four or five times....perhaps you had to be there to find amusement in it all.  Interesting flight to say the least, I was most entertained and now today after doing a little background check on him I just adore him!!  Dammit!!  Missed connection.  Maybe I need to post for him on Craigslist...KIDDING, TOTALLY KIDDING!!    Tiffany and I decided that he's a 33 year old, troubled, 6'5" man.  Due to the shear fact that he's 6'5", we've decided to overlook the fact that he's troubled and somewhat, ok, a lot hyperactive.  He's a smartass.  The best kind.

      I feel like blogging is a trend or something.   It's always embarrassing to start a blog (especially when it’s a hot trend). It takes a little pushing and a little shoving and then you don't know what to write about and you think it's all just stupid (which it probably is) but you forge ahead anyway and then ask all your friends to start blogs because you don't want to be the only asshole in your social circle talking about it like a technerd. Then your friends start blogs and their first posts are about how lame blogging is and how much they think it's dumb but they persist and more kids cave in. Soon enough every friendster you’ve ever had now miraculously has their own blog. And now you can go to bed content knowing you are a cliché.   The Moral: Peer pressure is still hot in 2004!

      Ladies and Gentlemen: I am about to say something that I never thought I would hear myself say.....drum roll please..............  I had by far the best time I've ever had with Nigel last night.  He never once insulted me, upset me, or criticized me.  He was complimentary and thrilled to see me. Truly a unique experience when one thinks of an evening out with Nigel.  No drama.  Of course we did our usual drill of why we would never work together and the "Janielle, you're the only one for me."  (which may I please add is very flattering and validating right now on some level)  He's a good kid.  I've seen major change in that kid over the past few months.  Maybe he's just projecting what he wishes for me to pick up on...but I think he's trying.  Nigel wears pink ties with grey suits....there's something to be said for that other then the fact that he's British.    Pink ties make Janielle happy.

      Last night I had a delightful evening with Kevin, Brian, and "Paul the Model."  We had dinner at the highly acclaimed Normans on Sunset.  My verdict: less then stellar.  I wasn't impressed.  Granted the decor is beautifully done, the kitchen is unparalleled with it's glass enclosure and tables in the middle of it for special patrons, and the service is bar none.  But it still didn't lessen the difficult time I had finding anything on the menu that I would even attempt to eat... so for my starter I settled on Vietnamese Spring Rolls with tuna sashimi.  Yep, I was that desperate.  For my main dish I had Key West Sole with asparagus and potatos in a salsa butter sauce.    By the end of our 3 1/2 hour dinner and $100 a person later, I was asking to be taken to In 'n' Out so I could eat dinner.  Everyone got quite a laugh and I think they all concurred on some level, but it was Brian's birthday so whatever Baby Brian wants, Baby Brian gets.  The real highlight of the evening was my determining Brian to be a "Club Level Drunk."  Paul laughed hysterically at the phrase and found it to be oddly perfect.  Brian even liked it and found it a suitable title for himself.    Best of all was for the grand total of 230 minutes I was able to forget.

      Every journey begins With but a small step. And every day is a chance For a new, small step In the right direction. Just follow your Heartsong.   by Mattie Stepanek  Mattie died on Tuesday, June 22, of complications from a rare form of muscular dystrophy.  He was 13.  Amazingly enough he was never expected to live beyond 24 hours of his birth.  Somehow 13 short years doesn't seem nearly long enough.  When asked in an interview with Larry King in 2002 how he managed to survive after each operation his response was, "because the doctors celebrated life with me."  When furthered questioned as to who the most influential person in his life was he replied, "my mom has been the best thing to ever happen to me in my life."  One can't help but cry when they hear things like that.    Mattie participated in college level courses at the young age of 10 and wished to be remembered as a peacemaker.  Jimmy Carter was his idol.  He wanted us all to make the world a better place, however small.  Mattie extraordinarily enough was able to maintain his faith in God throughout his illness which enabled him to never fear death.  He cherished each and every day as a gift. Mattie was successful in leaving the world a better place then in which he found it.

      One roundtrip plane ticket to San Francisco given as a birthday gift.&nbsp; Flora is going to be using this ticket in the next few hours to go spend the weekend with Bill.&nbsp; I'd be lying to you all if I said that I wasn't envious.&nbsp; When Keegan told me last night my stomach turned and I literally felt ill.&nbsp; It makes me sick to know that he can return her phone calls, even devote 48 hours for her entertainment in a city far too sophisticated for her kind and yet he can't even return my phone call.&nbsp; Like my mom said, I guess I now know where I stand.&nbsp; Not that I didn't before.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Keegan and I are going to be going to San Francisco at the end of August and I can safetly&nbsp;say that I have no intention of contacting him while there.&nbsp; He has more then made it clear that he wants no part in any kind of a friendship with me.&nbsp; But that got me to thinking...if you'd put such great energy and emotion into someone previously and before you left you made it clear that you wanted to remain friends, then what is the harm in returning a phone call or an email...the small gesture is almost effortless and creates less heartache and at the  very  least puts your mind at ease.&nbsp; Why!?!?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I've never really had any sort of reasonable explanation for why he acts the way he does...I have a pretty good idea.&nbsp; But I'm sorry Bill, that excuse is quickly getting old.&nbsp; You can't use it forever.&nbsp; It's tired.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I guess Flora's going to visit him really irks me on another level because he never wanted me around his friends citing that they wouldn't like me and I them...yet he'll let one of the most un-PC, obnoxious, over bearing people I've ever met in my life around them.&nbsp; Makes no sense.&nbsp; Perhaps he wants his&nbsp;San Francisco friends to know that he associates&nbsp;with trash. &nbsp;  I think I'm a glutton for punishment.&nbsp; I want to be able to ask someone some day how I met them and I want their response to be, "because I willed you here."

      Last night a group of us went out to this wonderful little restaurant in Silverlake called Cafe Stella to celebrate Bastille Day.&nbsp; Keegan finally got to meed Tiffany.&nbsp; All in all I'd say things went well.&nbsp; It felt like a tiny piece of Paris in the middle of L.A.&nbsp; Actually it was a bit refreshing to feel like I'd stepped out of the city for a moment.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  After our three hour dinner and an ever so slight disagreement&nbsp;over the tip, Keegan and I went to Beverly Hills where we met Lauren and some girl.&nbsp; (don't be fooled, Lauren's a boy)&nbsp; We all met up at Backstage and it was a total bust!&nbsp; However I did finally manage to talk to the owner who is Sting's manager....Yay!!&nbsp; I'll keep going back to that place just for that mere fact.  &nbsp;  So I still have yet to write back to Nigel.&nbsp; I've calmed down a great deal about the whole thing, but I can't help but feel like I should address it in some way because it is going to be virtually impossible for me to avoid him for the rest of my life....however nice that thought&nbsp;may be.  &nbsp;  If truth be told I don't really know how to go about addressing it.&nbsp; I don't want to attack him, I don't want to point fingers, and I'm certainly not out to make him feel like shit.&nbsp; I just don't want an argument.&nbsp; I suppose my silence is making some sort of a statment to him, but like I've said previously....Nigel's immune to the feelings of others.&nbsp; They just don't register on his radar.&nbsp; Plus I'm not quite sure what I'm hoping to gain from all of this because he does  not  in any way, shape, or form ever make me feel better about myself or make my life better in any way.&nbsp; Bottom line: he doesn't contribute in a positive respect.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  On second thought, maybe it's best not to say anything.

      Some things a select few have overlooked because they were too concerned with the bad to see the good:  Rainy days make me sad.  I love the wind in my hair, even though I'll curse the knots in it later.  I still love to know what my parents are having for brunch on Sundays...it makes me miss home a little more.  Every day I question whether or not I made the right decision in moving 3000 miles away from my family.  I love that my laugh makes other people laugh.  I know that I made it on my own here without strings being pulled, phone calls being made, or favors being called in....I did it my way.  I'm proud of the fact that my parents have been married for 35 years.  I'm proud of my brother for pursuing a political career and even prouder that so far he's proved a success.  Despite your opinion, I was and never will be too good for public transportation.  Sometimes I'm afraid that I'll never live up to the expectations that others have for me.  My favorite noise is a comfortable silence.  I love that the friends I had as a child are still among my closest today.  I think we all need to believe in something greater then ourselves.  Last, but certainly not least...you will never know me.

      Lately, I've been consumed by notions of regret. Little moments that slipped away. Merely incidents, yet at times I'm consumed by them. Thousand of inconsequential moments that weave together to form the fabric of regret. I've always believed that once I got to a certain point in my life that regret would be null and void because every instance in my life would have led to where I was currently. If I was happy that all regret would be incidental because it was required to achieve said happiness.  But what if I am wrong. I recently saw a movie (a cute romantic comedy) that put my point of view in question. What if mistakes can't be undone? Maybe regret should be harped upon because it has led to your undoing. But if that is true then what is the point of regret? If something can't be undone than is regret simply a tool welded for growth. How can we move on and grow if regret glues us to the past?  My current issue of regret swirls around the little moments in life that I missed. Like never talking to that guy in college. Or never keeping in touch with that simple friendship. I feel as though my life consist of a series of regrets. Is this because I lack the confidence to stand behind my decisions? Is it because I hate myself for being cowardly? Or is it because I feel the future holds no light for me and I'm enveloped in a past that binds me to my future?  In the end I know I will regret all the regret that overwhelmed my life. I feel as though I have learned nothing from my regrets. I live a life of could have been rather than could be. The thing about regret is that we tend to romanticize it. We turn our past into what society has done to the fifties. It was a simpler time. Everything was black and white. Young teenagers went to the soda shop in their poodle skirts. People forget that the fifties was fraught with racism and sexism. Regret works the same way, the only difference is because it never really happened, there is no way of knowing what it might have been. We always romanticize regret in that we assume that things would have been better had we done the thing we regret not doing. It's kind of like how we assume that if aliens exist that they are going to be smarter than us earthlings.  So, I will be content with my notion that things that are supposed to happen will happen when they are supposed to. Maybe if one of those regrets wasn't a regret but an actuality, then my life might be ten times worse. Traces of the past will always haunt us and that is ok as long as they don't control us. It's justified to look back as long as you pay attention to the road in front of you. But I don't know, maybe I will regret saying that.

      Just as I suspected, he apologized.  Via email.  Title of heresaid email "hey yo."  Gee, that email was just begging to be opened and read.  Granted I should have immediately hit the delete key, but my curiosity got the better of me and I read it.  Now, I have to say that I was right.  I knew that he would apologize this time.  I knew that he realized that he had gone too far.  He felt badly about it, or as badly as Nigel could ever feel about anything considering that his self-righteousness is practically suffocating.  The email states that he apologizes for upsetting me and that although he knows that we argued, he doesn't remember what was said.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!?!??!  Am I supposed to buy into that garbage?!?!  THEN....THEN he has the gaul to ask if we want to go to the movies later this week.  This is some sort of joke, right?!?  I mean the kid really can't be this dense can he?!?    So I call Keegan, tell her what happened...ask her if I should just let bygones be bygones.  She advises me to "enlighten" him as to what was said so that he learns that he can't go that far.  However, note to self, she is in fight mode due to recent events.  Drama was the name of the game yesterday.  However I am in no mood or no condition for that matter to start a war of words with Nigel.  It wouldn't be pretty.  (no pun intended)  Although I don't feel that I can ignore it either because my silence in a sense is condoning his actions.  I can't let him win.  Not this time.    I think I should create a powerpoint bulleted presentation on the highlights of our argument.  Ideas?  Thoughts??    Haven't written back yet...I think I'll make him sweat it out a bit longer.  Not that he will sweat it out.  Once again the arrogance factor kicks in and he can safetly rest in his office knowing that at the end of the day his intellect is far superior to my own and that his life will be far superior...or so his delusional mind thinks...  Oh Nigel, sometimes I think you'll never learn.

      After a brief hiatus I am back.  Nigel has this uncanny ability to make my blood boil.  I have no clue why I allow him to get under my skin the way he does...maybe it's because he points out my flaws like nobody's business...maybe he's just an asshole.  Yeah, that's it...  We'd been doing well over the past week or so.  Basically he stayed out of my way and I stayed out of his.  We hadn't seen each other in awhile so I thought it wouldn't be such a bad idea if we were social...together.  Once again, I was wrong.  It all started on Saturday when I had a lapse in judgment and invited him to the Galaxy Soccer game.  He was already going with his family.  I was going with Eugenia and John.    Just as I was saying to Eugenia how weird it would be if we ran into Nigel, he comes walking down the staircase next to our seats with his family...TOO WEIRD.  He doesn't notice us.  It was the first time that I had ever seen his family.  To his family's credit, his parents appear very much in love.  He seems to adore her.  Too bad that didn't rub off on their children.  I blame his mother for not hugging him enough as a child.  It's minute 83 of the game and Nigel finally realizes that we're 2 rows behind him.  He sees me and his face gets beet red.  I loved it!  He was mortified.  HAHAHAHA  After the game is over he proceeds to book it out of the stadium, leaving his parents in the dust.  Now one can only surmise that the last thing he wanted to happen was for me to meet his parents...it's like he's ashamed of all of us even though he told me the other day that I would be the only one that he would ever allow to meet his parents.  I think it's just lip service.  The kid's a freak.  End of story.  Cut to Sunday night after a long day at Disneyland with screaming children and ridiculous heat.  I come home, Keegan tells me that he's called.  I call him back.  We all agree to go out for a drink.  All is fine and well.  Keegan gets the grand idea to have everyone back to our house.  Fine.  It's still relatively early.  We all go back and the clan quickly grows.  We're all drinking, laughing, having a generally good time...but that was not to last my friends.  Nigel tells me that he needs to talk to me outside.  I reluctantly agree because as we all know, Nigel+alcohol=drama to the nth power.  As soon as we get outside he proceeds to have the nerve to tell me that I have far too many ugly qualities and that Keegan and I are frighteningly lazy and that we really don't do real work.  My blood begins to BOIL!!!!!  I start yelling and swearing and just generally acting like an idiot.  How dare he talk to me like that...but the buck didn't stop there.  Nope.  He had to make matters worse.  He continues to point out my flaws, question the importance of my job, the likelihood that I would ever have a career, that I have so many good things about me, but my "ugly qualities" so many times will overshadow them.  Fine...you know what Nig...LET ME GO!!! And that is exactly what I screamed at him.  I told him just to let me go, not to concern himself with me when he could only find negative qualities about me.    OH AND THE BEST thing of the night happened when he was on the phone with Lauren and I asked him if Lauren was coming over and he proceeded to tell me to shut up and flicked me off...gets off the phone and proceeds to berate me, telling me to "never do that again, you know better!!!"  THAT'S IT! I'VE HAD IT!  I will not continue to be talked to like this...  So, I tell him to leave...I proceed to tell him that I'm done, not to bother with me ever again.  Forget he ever knew me.  I proceed to tell him that not even Christopher can save his ass with me this time.  He just rolls his eyes at me, I slam the door so hard that I thought for sure the glass was going to break.  I storm inside, Keegan immediately yells at Nigel, "What did you do to her!!!!"  I go straight upstairs, citing to Keegan that if anyone thinks it would be cute or funny to follow me or wake me up or if Nigel even came within 5 feet of my bedroom door that I was moving out...end of story.  I thought that I could sleep on it...wake up this morning and realize that I had acted irrationally.  I'm a girl and sometimes girls do that...but NOPE!  I am completely in the right.  I did nothing wrong.  In fact, I didn't do enough.  My mind is reeling with things I should have said to that bastard.    Believe me, I thought about firing off an email...but what good would it do...it would just further serve to involve me in this ridiculous game.    The real kicker is that after I was finished yelling, as I was about to go inside Nigel grabs my arm and says in the most arrogant, condescending tone, "I look forward to being married to you some day."  I give him the look of death and tell him to go to hell.    Best night ever.  And Christopher, not even you can save it this time.  I'm done.  My unborn children thank me.

      My father's great aunt died yesterday.&nbsp; She was 87.&nbsp; Her name was Pearl.&nbsp; Perhaps I had met her once upon a time, but I'm not certain.&nbsp; Eighty-seven seems kind of young in the grand scheme of things, doesn't it??&nbsp;   I have had the fortunate luck (knock on wood) of never really suffering the death of someone close to me.&nbsp; However, I think I'm getting to the stage in life where this 25 year reprieve may be ending.&nbsp; It's not a pleasant thought.&nbsp;   I've always been envious of the fact that my brother is almost 8 years my senior.&nbsp; He will have gotten to be with my parents 8 more years then I ever will have been...it's a fact that can't be helped and it's pointless to waste energy on thinking about it, but I can't help it.&nbsp; It just doesn't seem fair. Another thing that I've thought about lately is that my brother also got married right out of college and has been married for almost 10 years.&nbsp; I'm 25 and nowhere  near  being married.&nbsp; As the years go by, that's one less year I will have with my future husband.&nbsp; Now I know, or at least I've been told that matters like this happen in their own good time, but sometimes I can't stand it!&nbsp; I was never one for delay of gratification.&nbsp; Most importantly I suppose I don't want to be a statistic and end up a part of the 60% divorce rate.&nbsp;   I think I need to start believing that I belong in this body and this body belongs in this life.

      My brother is currently in the third quarter of what will hopefully be longer then his "15 minutes of fame."&nbsp; I came into the office Monday morning to be greeted with phone calls and emails saying that my brother had been quoted by FOX news on his views about Farhenheit 9/11.&nbsp; He even made ABC and other various news outlets.&nbsp; Apparently the media is trying to comment on the conservative side of an already biased, inflammatory "documentary."&nbsp; I use the word 'documentary' loosely because it's basically just a propaganda piece.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I told him that with all of the hype currently surrounding him that he was going to need a PR person.&nbsp; All fingers point to me!!&nbsp; He wasn't thrilled with the idea.&nbsp; But you know what, he's gonna need me some day to help him carry the state of California in a presidential election.&nbsp; Just you wait.&nbsp;  &nbsp; You know you've made it when you can Google your name and it pops up more than one time.&nbsp; Hell, I can't even do that.&nbsp; It can be his claim to fame for the time being.  &nbsp; Kudos to Maurice.&nbsp; He's making a name for himself.

      I hadn't seen Tudor in 18 months.&nbsp; He lives in la Jolla, approximately 2 hours south of L.A. on a good day.&nbsp; We've been best friends for the better part of our lives.&nbsp; He moved to Rhode Island in high school, then on to Boston for college, and last but certainly not least, La Jolla post graduation.&nbsp; After 8 years of being separated, we ended up a mere two hours from one another.&nbsp; Now one could easily assume that we would see each other all of the time...and if you did that, you would be wrong.  &nbsp;  You see, Tudor has a girlfriend...Julie.&nbsp; We don't like Julie.&nbsp; Just trust me on this one.&nbsp; You wouldn't like her.&nbsp; He's been dating her for almost two years.&nbsp; They live together for God's sakes.&nbsp; Apparently Julie is threatened by me and she has issues with Tudor and I seeing each other.&nbsp; How very wrong she is to assume that there are unresolved feelings there.&nbsp; Word on the street is that she thinks I'm in love with him.&nbsp; Silly little girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know it's bad when Tudor will even tell me to my face that I wouldn't like her.&nbsp; I think I would eat her for lunch.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm not gonna lie...I love Tudor a great deal.&nbsp; He's like family to me, always will be...nothing more, nothing less.&nbsp; I like that there's no tension.&nbsp; Our relationship is clearly defined and we like it that way.&nbsp; It's comfortable.&nbsp; I'll always know that he'll be around.&nbsp; I'll always know that should he move to Germany in a few months that I'll see him again, someday.&nbsp; We've never lost each other and I'm not about to start now.&nbsp; I like that I can fall asleep in a cab with his arm around me and I'm holding his hand.&nbsp; I like that he still opens doors for me and can hug me and tell me that he loves me before he drives off and I don't see him again for God knows how long.&nbsp; I like that he can look at me and tell me that after 20+ years that he's proud of the person I've become and I too am just as&nbsp;proud of him.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Back to the point of my story.&nbsp; So Tudor came for the BBQ on Saturday.&nbsp; He had previously stated after sitting in traffic getting out of OC that he was only staying until 8 or 9....HAHAHA, that's most laughable.&nbsp; Let's just say that he left around noon on Sunday.&nbsp; Silly boy, he actually thought he was going to be able to stick to that plan.&nbsp; He came because Julie was out of town.&nbsp; He was free.&nbsp; It was the right thing to do.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We had a wonderful time.&nbsp; I know Keegan enjoyed seeing him as well.&nbsp; We talked about everything from first grade to the thought of some day having children.&nbsp; He was a huge hit at the party and got along famously with everyone.&nbsp; I just adore having the popular kid at the party as my friend!!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Tudor makes me forget...he makes me remember that there are decent guys out there.&nbsp; So much so in fact, that I couldn't even bring myself to burden him with&nbsp;recent past events.&nbsp; They just weren't worth talking about.&nbsp; Our time together is so precious that I&nbsp;just didn't want to waste it talking about something so inconsequential...at least in the grand scheme of things inconsequential.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Unfortunatly for Tudor he never brought his cell phone with him anywhere over the course of those 24 hours.&nbsp; Hence when he got in his car he had 16 missed calls...all from Julie.&nbsp; It seems Julie had no clue where he was when she returned home unexpectedly at midnight on Saturday.&nbsp; She quickly grew worried and freaked out crying, calling him on his cell phone wondering if he was dead somewhere.&nbsp; He knew that he had a lot of explaining to do because he never told her where he was going.&nbsp; She wouldn't have stood for it.&nbsp; Once again, silly girl.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For a second he contemplated a million different excuses, but at the end of the day he was going to step up to the plate and tell her the truth.&nbsp; Honesty is always the best policy.&nbsp; He said that it was going to be a long day, but that it had to be done and that if she had a problem with it, then she needed to grow up.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp; I couldn't agree with you more.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Now if Julie had any kind of brain, she wouldn't push the issue.&nbsp; She'd accept it and move on because if she had any kind of ability to read him, she could easily see that he's not happy.&nbsp; Hell, he's downright miserable.&nbsp; She'd see that she's a large contributing factor to his unhappiness and if she wants to keep him she'll change her miserable ways.&nbsp; Shape up or ship out.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  He said he'd call me today and let me know how it all panned out.&nbsp; My guess is that she didn't make a big deal about it...that is if she has half a brain.&nbsp; I'm gonna go with the field on this one and say no...but she could surprise me.&nbsp; He deserves better then her.&nbsp; I know he's in a difficult spot by working for her father and his friends all being her friends first so he can never talk to anyone about the situation.&nbsp; He stepped into her life.&nbsp; I know the feeling and it isn't always a comforting one.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The best thing for him to do now (and as much as I'm going to hate it) is for him to make a clean break and just move.&nbsp; Get away.&nbsp; Get far far away from here.&nbsp; Make a life for yourself on your terms and when you do you're going to make it easier to live with yourself.&nbsp; Right now you're existing.&nbsp; I'll hate his leaving, but it's what he's got to do.&nbsp; He's come too far to be held back from greatness by&nbsp;some bike messenger or whatever the hell she does for a living.&nbsp; Leave, I support you.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Promise me you'll call when you get there.

      Keegan has this ridiculous habit of thinking that every time we see someone, she knows them....seldom, if ever is she correct.&nbsp; Hell, we could be watching an AT&T Wireless commercial and she'll swear that she knows the person in it.   Last night at Carmine's was no different.&nbsp; We both noticed a girl sitting at a corner table that we couldn't place.&nbsp; We racked our&nbsp;brains for over an hour, calling mulitple side bars from the boys to discuss it, but we came up empty handed every time.&nbsp; Finally I knew that she had to work at Amadeus.&nbsp; Keegan (as terrible as this sounds) could place her bringing her something to drink before she got her hair cut.&nbsp; Yes I know, we're sick.   This girl finally comes over to our table to bum a cigarette.&nbsp; Keegan immediately tells her that she recognizes her and asks her if she works at Amadeus.&nbsp; Her response (are you ready?!?)&nbsp;"No I work at Jonathan's, are you both stylists?!?"&nbsp; We of course kind of giggle to ourselves and all I can say is "I love him!"&nbsp; Over and over....and over and over.&nbsp; I looked like a lune!&nbsp; It was Kimberly, Jonathan's assistant/new hair stylist who took 4 hours to cut some guy's hair in the last episode.&nbsp;   Oh. My.God.&nbsp; Most of you have no idea how much I love Jonathan.&nbsp; This is a dream come true for me.&nbsp; I want nothing more then for him to cut my hair.&nbsp; And she was in Pasadena!!&nbsp; We might be neighbors and I don't even know it! Imagine it!&nbsp; We could become friends, she could tell Jonathan that she met the perfect girl for him...Shut up, Kevin.&nbsp; He likes girls, this one's in my family!!&nbsp; AHHHHHHHHHH!!&nbsp;   You would think that after all of that excitement, my night couldn't have gotten any better...I've got&nbsp; 4 words for you: "Amish in the City."&nbsp; Learn it.&nbsp; Love it.&nbsp; You'll be a better person for it.

      Dearest Flora,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of recent events, it has been made abundantly clear to me that you are a much smaller human being then I had originally given you credit for being.&nbsp; You see, and forgive me for assuming, I thought that for the most part we were past the events of October of last year...however I now know that we are not.&nbsp; Thanks for the memo.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your manipulative efforts may work on weaker minds, such as your beloved boyfriend, but on stand-up individuals like Keegan and Christopher they are altogether lost.&nbsp; For as much as you would like to make a dent in my and Keegan's relationship, it will  never  happen.&nbsp; I promise you that.&nbsp; It is most laughable that you thought for even a nanosecond that Keegan would go to Pete's birthday party without me.&nbsp; Hell, she despises him as much as I do and here's one for you...she knows as much about the situation as I do...she knows everything!!!&nbsp; Every last detail.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't pity your current situation, nor do I pity either one of you.&nbsp; You both will get what you deserve and right now you deserve each other.&nbsp; It all comes back to karma and in a way, I am your karma.&nbsp; I supposedly did to you what you had already done to countless others.&nbsp; Oh and Flora, do you forget what I know??&nbsp; And is Pete dumb enough to think that I don't remember every little detail he'd ever told me about himself??&nbsp; I think my information may come in handy one day.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I promised myself that I would always be a lady given the current climate...I will continue to do so.&nbsp; But I'm disappointed in you.&nbsp; Your actions as of late were not in your best interest.&nbsp; You're capable of better.&nbsp; It was your idea to sweep everything under the rug, so don't go airing your dirty laundry now.&nbsp; It's a bit late for that, don't you think?  &nbsp;&nbsp; Now I know that all you every truly aspired to&nbsp; be with that 1.8GPA of yours was Mrs. Pete Frank complete with the Jonathan Club and LACC memberships, but really...did you ever think that would come to pass??&nbsp; They have these nasty little things called membership committees to ensure that your kind never even see the ladies room.&nbsp; You possess no class and everyone will always know that you're not a part of the club...you'll give yourself away.&nbsp; You'll take all of the fun out of guessing what hole your family crawled out of...it's a pity really.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose this is all for the best because given your behavior this past weekend, I am washing my hands of you and your little dog, too.&nbsp; You will cease to exist to me and I will always know that I acted in a respectable manner.&nbsp; I think a part of me always hoped that we could work things out, but I see that you're too small for that.&nbsp; I wish you the best.   regards,  &nbsp; janielle

      Life No Longer For Sale.   My generation has grown up with the best ad slogan ever in existence and yet we don't heed its words. Just Do It. It sounds so easy and we make it so hard. At best we contemplate just doing it, but that defeats the whole purpose. I spend so much time trying to will myself out of my situation that I spend no time actually trying to get out of it. When there is a will there is a way, that's how the saying goes. But the way needs to be taken; it doesn't just come because you will it. The will gives you the answers but the way gives the results.   Today, I am taking my life back. It is off the market. I no longer feel the need to sell it. I've realized that I don't need a new life; I just need a little renovation on the current one. I'm determined to have the red tape taken away from my life. The pool of misery is man made. So I intend to build myself a hot tube of happiness. Wait that sounds kind of sleazy. But the point remains the same.   I am going to just do it. No more excuses. No more willing without taking the way. Why do self-fulfilling prophecies always have negative connotations? I intend to make a new self-fulfilling prophecy a positive incarnation.&nbsp; I'm going to take the hand that has&nbsp;been dealt to me and try to make it better.   And if all else fails, I'll at least learn to bluff a little better.

      Hopelessly Confused  Just because something isn't wrong doesn't necessarily  mean that it's right either. I feel like I live my whole life this way. We tend to rationalize things as being right simply because there is nothing wrong with them. Whether it is a relationship or a work situation, the lack of cons doesn't add up to pros. But the risk of change brings fear that it could be worse. Is it better to stay put because you are content rather than risk the possibility of misery?  I am eating myself up inside with thoughts of the future and the present. I want to make sure that the present facilities a pleasant future, but at the same time I don't want a present that is consumed by thoughts of the unknown quantity. I guess that is the problem you must face when you have a "day job" which only provides monetary compensation. To ask yourself to rely on the faith of your dreams to make it all seem worthwhile. But all faith wavers. Faith is hard, it questions you everyday. I worry about the one day when it pushes me to the brink. So naturally I wonder where I want to be on that day.  The saying goes: "expect the worst, and hope for the best" (or something to that effect). Dreams require so many elements to come together in just the right formation and time. And in the right place. Maybe leaving one place will tamper with the set course or maybe it will spark it.  And then comes the issue of loyalty. I'm naturally an extremely loyal person. I feel like I'm betraying a person or a place by even looking to change situations. There is always a huge problem when one is loyal and also non-confrontational. I don't want to leave my situation but I don't know how to change it. If I fix the problems then I might realize that the car is still a piece of crap. Or worse yet maybe it needs a whole new engine.  My confusion is only made arithmetically worse by my emphasis of my decision being the end all be all of my life. Why do I weight my decisions in the next few weeks to be earth shatteringly important when really every single decision we make alters our path in life. I'm a fool for thinking and a fool for not thinking enough. I see the road in front of me... I'm just not sure what exit to take. I hope that if I take the wrong one then at least it will be easy off/ easy on.

      I know it's been awhile since I've last posted.  In the interim I've had a bit of a breakdown one could call it.  I think it all boils down to confusion.  Maybe I'm just pissed off that my life has turned out the way it has, it's hardly as I envisioned it would be on May 18, 2002 when I graduated from college.   Where did I go wrong...was it getting on that Continental flight on September 12, 2002??!!!  I suppose I'll never know.
