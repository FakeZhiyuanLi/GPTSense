      i finally know what this song means, and how it applies to my life. this IS my theme, i guess warriors blue is just background music  if you want, i can explain how this applies to me, but it will take some time.  Alone for a while I've been searching through the dark, For traces of the love you left inside my lonely heart. To weave by picking up the pieces that remain, Melodies of life - love's lost refrain.  Our paths they did cross, though I cannot say just why. We met, we laughed, we held on fast, and then we said goodbye. And who'll hear the echoes of stories never told? Let them ring outloud till they unfold.  In my dearest memories, I see you reaching out to me. Though you're gone, I still believe that you can call out my name.  A voice from the past, joining yours and mine. Adding up the layers of harmony. And so it goes, on and on. Melodies of Life, To the sky beyond the flying birds - forever and beyond.  So far and away, see the bird as it flies by. Gliding through the shadows of the clouds up in the sky. I've laid my memories and dreams upon those wings. Leave them now and see what tomorrow brings.  In your dearest memories, do you remember loving me? Was it fate that brought us closer and now leaves me behind?  A voice from the past, joining yours and mine. Adding up the layers of harmony. And so it goes, on and on. Melodies of life, To the sky beyond the flying birds - forever and on.  If I should leave this lonely world behind, Your voice will still remember our melody. Now I know we'll carry on. Melodies of Life, Come circle round and grow deep in our hearts, as long as we remember

      Love can be easily equated to catching butterflies. Beautiful butterflies, fluttering in the sun. And a net comes down, and one of them is caught. Often, the butterfly doesn't know that it has been caught, it's perfectly content no matter what. The catcher then puts the butterfly in a jar for a while, to study it.  just remember: most butterflies that are caught end up with pins sticking through them, trophies of the catcher as he hunts down another helpless victim.  but there is one catcher who doesn't use a net, and he has seen the most beautiful butterfly of all...  but there is one problem: this butterfly has already been caught in a net, and she seems perfectly happy to remain in that net forever, she can't even see it.  but our catcher still tries. If he used a net, he knows he would have a good chance of catching this butterfly, and he would definitely be able to catch any other one he wished. But he knows, you should never settle for less when it comes to butterfly catching.  he will not settle for less than this butterfly, nor will he settle for more, because there is no butterfly more beautiful than this one. But he refuses to use a net out of fear that it might hurt the butterfly, or even worse, scare her away.  so instead he holds out his hand, with a small bit of sugar on it, hoping that the butterfly will come to him of her own free will, because he knows that this is not something that can be forced on someone.  but the butterfly flies off, she can't even see him standing there. He follows as best as he can, but it's no use, he can barely keep up with her.  he continues to follow as fast as he can, heedless of where his feet take him. He knows that he may very well stumble off a cliff and fall to his death in this chase, but it doesn't matter. If he can't catch this butterfly, he'll die trying.  and so the butterfly flies around, still trapped in her jar. She could get out if she really wanted to, all butterflies can, but they can never see the jar until it's too late.  and our catcher continues, he doesn't want to stick the butterfly in a jar of his own, or pin her up behind glass. He just wants her to land on his shoulder, and comfort him as he wanders.  he knows he has very little hope, he knows that the butterfly probably won't see him, but he's going to keep following her wherever she goes.  he doesn't know whether or not she wants out of her jar, he just wishes she would open up her sees and see him.  he'll make it his life's goal, catching this butterfly. He's going to follow her forever, watching out for her whether she cares or not...  and so he continues to follow her, follow the butterfly, and finally, he gains some courage, and he gets closer to her...  and she sees him, she finally begins to open her eyes and see him. But... She can only see him as a friend, and nothing more. She still has no reason to abandon the one who has already caught her and go to him, because she is happy as she is...  when he first found that she had already been caught, he began to slip, he stumbled as he followed her, and he fell off a Cliff. He was falling, tumbling, turning over and over in turmoil when a white dove flew past and revealed to him that the cliff wasn't all that tall after all, and he landed on his feet with the help of the dove, and he continued to follow the butterfly, to watch her more closly, if only from a distance.  if only he could get her to open her eyes farther, she might be able to see him, the real him. just once he would like that, he would like that very much indeed. even if it means he has to fall off another cliff for it to happen.  but he is much closer to her now, close enough to talk to her, perhaps even close enough to tell her how he feels. But...would that really fix anything?  no, it wouldn't, it would only complicate things even more than they already are. as he saw earlier, she is already perfectly happy to remain where she is forever. the only thing that mattersd to him is for her to be safe and happy, her happiness comes first, before everything else, before even his own life, if needs be.   and so he... He does what will hurt him the most, he...stops chasing her. He just lets her flutter off. he'll still be there if she ever wants to return, but he isn't going to force her. it's because he understands now, he understand just what it means to truly love someone, he understand that if you love someone, you want the best for them, you want them to be truly happy above all else. and that is how he feels about this butterfly, he truly does love her, more than he could have possibly thought it was possible for anyone to love anything.   and so she flutters off into her future, and he remains behind, knowing full well that there is nothig that could possibly be any more painful for him. But he also know that it is best for her if her life remains simple, she is happy where she is so why ask her to change anything?  and he speaks to her, even though she has gone and can no longer hear him...  "Please, please forgive me but i do love you. please understand how i feel about you. even if you can't love me back, just know that i will always love you.i only want you to be happy, if you want me to just leave and not bother you asgain...then i will do as you wish. i have no desire for you to be happy, just please grant me this one wish of mine: ...please continue to grow, grow and become stronger and more beautiful, continue to grwo forever..." and so he watches her fluttering off on those delicate wings into the sunset, and...He smiles slightly, as a tears rolls down his face...  "i love you, i always have, and i always will. i will wait for the time that you fly to me, even if that time never comes, i will await you forever, because some things are worth waiting for, even if they never do come to pass."  ...so were his parting words to her

      so what stories will be here?  other than about 24 installments of Legacy of the Shooting Stars, and any sequels thereof, there will also be...    Of Bulfrogs and Butterflies (an odd, symbolic story)  Parian Sword (might be set in fudal Japan, i haven't decide yet)  Three Shakes of a Lamb's Tail (i know, i'm a sucker for happy endings. must be finished by August 6th)  "story" (doesn't have a name yet, based on a wierd dream that i had)  plus other stories that i haven't thought up yet!    but i thought kevin hated writing?  kevin likes to write, IF he gets to write about something he likes and IF it turns out the way he wants (barely ever happens)  progress so far... i have the first 5 episodes of Legacy of the Shooting Stars done, but i'm going to redo them because they weren't perfect (i'm getting way too much like my sister, aren't i?)

      where do stories come from? why do they come to us? i have found that many stories will come to me in dreams and in day dreams, but what part of my mind do these stories come from? i suppose that the only way i can hope to understand the origin of stories is to tell them.    I just feel rhythm emotion i just feel warmth forever and more only to share, i'm making myself to give everything in so many ways i just feel rhythm emotion i just feel kiss forever and more only to tell, i'm being for you, but so far away!

      i had it once. That thing that men sometimes call Ultima. There is no real name for it, that most priceless of treasures that men are willing to give their lives for. Once, long ago, i held it in my hand...  i still can't believe i was so young when i found it. i was just a small child wandering lost, surrounded by people i didn't know. i was lost and confused and...i saw something in the distance that caught my eye. i walked over and took a closer look...and there i beheld the greatest gift this earth has to offer.  Ultima.  i held it in my hand, it was as if it WISHED to be found by me. i never let go of it, i kept it for many years. It made my life worth living.  i was walking along one day and i just...let it go. i allowed it to slip from my hand. i didn't even watch as it rolled away along the ground, i didn't care.  i had no idea what it was worth.  i didn't really understand what it was.  sure, it was nice, but i never knew just how much that thing had meant to me until i had lost it.  but i knew in my heart that it was gone.  i had lost Ultima, the most sought after prize ever spoken of in legend.   it wasn't until after i had lost it that i knew what it was.  Ultima, it has many names, men call it different things depending on their own hearts. But i know now that it has no true name. No single word or set of words can ever hope to describe it. How odd that this thing so many seek only shows itself to those who have no idea what it is.  Ultima is pure emotion.  it is no thing of matter, and yet it matters far more than all other things.  I've lost it, I've lost that dearest of prizes.  it was so many years ago, and then i began to wander. i had no thought to look for it where i had dropped it, so i simply wandered the earth, hoping that it would be around the next corner.   i wandered so long that I've forgotten my own name.  i no longer need a name.  those without hearts have no need of names.  and i have no heart, at least not a whole one. That thing had become a part of my heart, when i lost it a part of my heart was lost as well. I'll never need a name again. One as lonely as i has no one to speak to, and thus a name would be extraneous.  my wandering was fruitless...  i came to the point that i gave up all hope of ever finding it again.  and then an old woman told me one day that she had seen it and knew where it was.  i asked her where, and she pointed up at the sky...  i looked and there it was, shining brightly in the heavens, forever beyond my reach!  and yet, somehow, a theif had taken it and claimed it for his own. perhaps he is no theif, erhaps he is the rightful owner after all, but i just can't help but be jealous.  and there it is in the sky even now, and yet the clouds of time obscure it from my view. it is so rare for me to catch a glimps of that most beautifull of beauties.  i wander under that sky now, i try to follow the star that Ultima now is to me, but i am lost. the clouds hide my guide in their darkness. and so much of the time i simply wander.  i will seek it all the days of my life, i will seek it as a ghost after my death.  it has given itself to another yet it is still bound to my heart. or rather, my heart is bound to it. my wandering is filled with pain because i know that i will never agin hold it in my hand. i will never again gaze into the truest of mirrors. it is not that i will fail, it is taht i HAVE failed. i faled all those years ago when i first let it slip from my hand.  i won't let go this time.  i will hold onto it untill i am burned to death in its flames.  it made me the happiest man to ever live, now that i have lost it am am the saddest...  i was a prince once, long ago.  now i am just a wanderer...  a wanderer...  without a name.

      great, just great  as if i don't already have enough to do, here comes another one  i'm now working on yet ANOTHER story, that makes like 5 or something  maybe i should just combine them all...no, that wouldn't work very well  the new story might be called "Omen Sword" or something like that, about an extremely powerful sword that a young man is forced to use, but the sword is so strong that it makes him loose control of himself. will he ever find what it is that will let him control this sword, and what is the secret of this sword, why is it so powerful to begin with?  and why would anyone ever froge a sword if it wasn't meant to be used as a weapon?  i might as well update on the other stories:  "story"-still no name, still no names for the characters, i could really use some help with this one but at least i have a ROUGH draft of it.  three shakes of a lamb's tail-still all i have is the ending of it and the basic theme that it will be about. i think i kinda know how i want to do this, and how i want to open and clos the story, but i doubt that this will be done in time for the 60th anniversary, maybe by the 61st but that's kinda streching it too.  The True Story of the Wanderer-formerly know as "Butterfly Catching" this story is finished!-that still doesn't mean that i'm satisfied with it though, i wan tto re-work it alot but it can wait  Parain sword-still don't know if it will be set in the dark ages or fuedal Japan, but i'm thinking dark ages (that makes 3 in that time period) this one is probably going to end up getting combined with Omen Sword  and of course  Omen Sword-i have some key elements for it, but i haven't though about this one much yet, the idea just came to me this morning   i sure do have my work cu tout for me, don't i?

      sunday night i looked up at the sky and i saw the moon. this song just sprung into my head and i can't get it out no matter how hard i try...  Joeseph's face was as black as night, the pale yellow moon shone in his eyes. his path was marked by the stars of the southern hemisphere, and he walked his days under african skies.  this is the story of how we begin to remember, this is the powerfull pulsing of love in the vein. after the dream of falling and calling your name out, theese are the roots of rhythm and the roots of rhythm remain...  in early memory, misson music was ringing 'round my nursery door. i said "take this child, Lord, from Tucson, Arizona, give her the wings to fly through harmony and she won't bother you no more."  this is the story of how we begin to remember, this is the powerfull pulsing of love in the vein. after the dream of falling and calling your name out, these are the roots of rhythm and the roots of rhythm remain.  Joeseph's face was as black as the night, and the pale yellow moon shone in his eyes. his path was marked by the stars of the southern hemishpere, and he walked the length of his days under african skies.  this is one of the songs that i remember hearing when i was a small child, and it seems that for that reason it is a part of me.

       urlLink     Which Wolf's Rain Character are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Been a long road to follow, been there and gone tomorrow without saying goodbye to yesterday. Are the memories I hold still valid, or have the tears deluded them? Maybe this time tomorrow the rain will cease to follow, and the mist will fade into one more today. Something somewhere out there keeps calling. Am I going home? Will I hear someone, singing solace to the silent moon? Zero gravity, what's it like? Am I alone? Is somebody there beyond these heavy aching feet? Still the road keeps on telling me, to go on. Something is pulling me, I feel the gravity of it all.

      what would you do...   1) what would you do if you won the lottery? umm...move out of this neighborhood probably, not very nice, that it isn't   2) what would you do if you becaome king (or queen) of the world? i would either destroy the world completely or try to find some way to acheive peace. maybe 1 or 2 people i wouldn't be all that friendly to, but they deserve it ^_^.   3) what would you do if you got drafted by the army? umm...i would fight in the war and hope i don't die.   4) what would you do if nuclear war broke out? what can i do? not much, i guess try to find a safe place to hide with my family and friends.   5) what would you do if aliens attacked? tell carie that her real family had come back for her   6) what would you do if the internet crahsed forever? that would not be good, i would loose all forms of contact with some of my friends. i guess i'd have to learn how to dial a phone.   7) what would you do if all forms of elecrticity stopped working forever? i would slip into a coma and die, what did you think i'd do, party?   8) what would you do if you went blind? that would kinda suck, i wouldn't be able to read or play videogames, and i wouldn't be able to see my friends, but i guess i would be okay if i could still hear them.   9) what would you do if you went deaf? that wouldn't be as bad as going blind, i just wouldn't be able to listen to music and would have to learn sign language, not hearing music would be the worst of it.  10) what would you do if you went blind and deaf? that would just completely suck, i don't know how i would get by without being able to see or hear the people that i love and care about.  11) what would you do if all of your friends ditched you? friends? since when did i have friends? well i guess i have 1 or 2, but them didtching me wouldn't really be that much of a suprise.  12) what would you do if you found out one of your friends was madly in love with you? depends on which friend, some it wouldn't be that bad, but most of my friends...i'd probably either scream and runn away in fear or just slap them.  13) what would you do if kerry was elected? i have to agree with chris, moving to Japan would be good here, but maybe some other country where i actually speak the language would be a better idea.  14) what would you do if gay marriage was legalized? personally i belive that marrage is something that should be between a man and a woman, but i would really do anything.  15) what would you do if you went to sleep and woke up 20 years later? that wouldn't suprise me much if i did that. i'd just try to track down all my family and friends and hope that they're allright after so long, but in 20 years i doubt if they would remember me at all.  16) what would you do if you went to sleep and woke up 100 years later? i don't think i would be able to go on if all of my friends and loved ones were gone, i really don't know what i'd do, other than checking out all the cool new technology of course.  17) what would you do if you found out you had to retake all of school from kindergarten on up? taking kindergarten as a 17 year old would not be good, i think i'd run away. but if it meant that i could start my life over from kindergarten, i would try to remember to neve, ever let go of the people that mean the most to you, it just isn't possible to find anyone to replace them, ever.  18) what would you do if the was nothing to eat in the house but SPAM? fried spam is pretty good, but i think i would try to go buy som eother food as soon as possible, i don't know how ling i could stand eating nothing but spam.  19) what would you do if you were in a foreign country and couldn't speak the language at all? i can barely speak the language in THIS country! just kidding, i would probably get lost and start asking for for someone who spoke english and have people laugh at me.   20) what would you do if all your friends forgot who you were? actually many of them already have forgotten who i am, but i would probably just try t make them remeber, if that didn't work then...then well it would not be fun now would it?  21) what would you do if YOU forgot who you were? actually sometimes i forget my own name, that comes from not having anyone to talk to most of the time.but really, if i forgot who I was then i probably wouldn't remeber that i had to do something about it.  22) what would you do if you had to make a speach and completely forgot what you were gong to say? i would adlib and start babeling and wondering if i was spelling the word babeling right and eventually they would probably come and put a straight jacket on me and take me away.  23) what would you do if a guy in a squirell costume walked up to you and gave you a hug? i would freak  24) what would you do if you were really really bored? i would, well i would write this thing of course?  25) what would you do if i asked you to send this back to me with ALL the questions answered as seriously as you could? i'd say no, why should i send it to myself?

      ...When you know that you can never go back?  some time ago i posted on another blog a "list of things to do before i die". The first thing on this list, something that meant very much to me, was to see an old friend one last time, to tell her that i had always thought of her and that she meant very, very much to me...and to say one final good-bye.  now that i have seen her again, now that i have spoken with her and spent time with her, i find that i simply cannot bring myself to say good-bye to her. i hadn't realized just how much she had meant to me until she was lost, i didn't realize how much i had missed her until i found her again.  for some reason, i wasn't able to tell her how much she meant and how i had always thought of her all these years. i don't know why but i just don't say it.    i know that this item on my list will Never be completed, because it is just not possible for me to ever say good-bye to her for good, she means far too much to me for that.  it's been so long since we were close, but i find that the one thing that i desire most is to be as close to her as i once was so long ago. It's such a foolish thing to want, isn't it? i know that i can never mean as much to her as i once did, she has other people to take the place where i once stood inside her heart.  what i find truly sad is that after all these years i could find not a single person who could fill the void that she left within my own heart. There's just no replacing her, she is...special to me.  even after all of these long years, my feelings for her are very strong. i would say more, i truly wish that i could say more, but...i do not think that that would be a wise or prudent thing to do. She has already chosen her path, i have no right what so ever to even think about interfering. All i can do is hope and pray that the path she has chosen will be the right one for her.   in truth i do wish for her to change her path, but as i said it is her decision and hers alone.  i would tell her all these things, but i am afraid that it would distance us, and i want to be closer to her, not more distant.  i guess what i really, truly want is...  to be closer to her than just an old friend.  i pray that if she ever reads this she will understand how i feel, i would tell her in person but i am just too much of a coward.  i must ask, can you ever forgive me?  can you forgive me for letting us drift apart as we did?  can you forgive me for not finding you sooner?  and can you forgive me for felling the way that i do now?  can you forgive me for not telling you?  and would you be able to forgive me for telling you, if i ever do so?  I know that i am unable to forgive myself for all of these things, and i want to tell you that...you are and always have been very, very dear to me.  old friend, won't you please forgive this silly love-sick fool?

        Through early morning fog I see, Visions of the things to be, The pains that are withheld for me, I realize and I can see...  That suicide is painless. It brings on many changes. And I can take or leave it if I please.  The game of life is hard to play, I'm gonna lose it anyway. The losing card I'll someday lay, So this is all I have to say.  Suicide is painless. It brings on many changes. And I can take or leave it if I please.  The sword of time will pierce our skins. It doesn't hurt when it begins. But as it works its way on in, The pain grows stronger...watch it grin, but...  Suicide is painless. It brings on many changes. And I can take or leave it if I please.  A brave man once requested me, to answer questions that are key. Is it to be or not to be? And I replied 'Oh why ask me?'  Suicide is painless. It brings on many changes. And I can take or leave it if I please.  ...And you can do the same thing if you please.

      so this is the actual blog for writing about me and such and such. Warriors Blue will remain for my stories, if i ever finish them that is.   so what is Just Communication and what is Rhythm Emotion Pure?  both are the names of songs by the group TWO-MIX, i would have used Rhythm Emotion, but that was aparently already taken by someone else so oh well, i like Rhythm Emotion Pure better anyway, better song, even if the lyrics are the same.   so anyway, Just COmmunication will be for stuff like survey, quizess, and other freaky ness and this will actually be about me, if i remember to post on it, i might forget i have this new one, but oh well.   time is on i wanna spend my life, to get the reason why i'm so hot. look at me, there are no tears for fears now in my eyes  you made my mind brave and you made me find where to be with you, i'm ready for holding you so tight!  i just feel Rhythm Emotion,  i just feel light forever and more. only to be, i'm leading myself to a brighter way out, it's so far away!  i just feel Rhythm Emotion, i just feel love forever and more. only to you, i'm sending my heartbeat so far away!  time is now, i wanna risk my life, to get the reason why i'm so real. hear the voice, there is more story to tell with my heart.  won't leave the glory alone in the days you could see magic, i'm ready for dreaming on again!  i just feel Rhythm Emotion, i just feel warmth forever and more. only to share, i'm making myself to give everything in so many ways!  i just feel Rhythm Emotion, i just feel kiss forever and more. only to tell, i'm being for you, but so far away!  i just feel Rhythm Emotion,  i just feel light forever and more. only to be, i'm leading myself to a brighter way out, it's so far away!  i just feel Rhythm Emotion, i just feel love forever and more. only to you, i'm sending my heartbeat so far away!

      okay so this blog will atempt to be semi-normal and the others will no longer be used, i might still post random stuff on just communication once in a while but probably not. so this blog, being normal, will...actually i don't really know how to have a normal blog so i guess i'll try a "normal" ost for once...  so i'm getting kinda depressed lately. i know i';m usually kinda depressed but this is more than usual. summer is over half over and i've barely spent any time with my friends at all. some friends i've seen once or twice and some i haven't seen at all. later this month i'll get to spend a couple of days with jonathan, but i only see him a few times a year. all i've been doing lately is playing on my computer. i got addicted to RO again and today i can't log in due to server problems. some of you noted that my old blog was quite odd, and yeah it was, that's why this one is here to take it's place, Legacy of the Shooting Stars is pretty much over with for good. my dreams are getting odd too. first off it's odd that i remember my dreams at all, that usually only happens once a month or so. now i remember what i dreamed about every night and it's kinda freaky. my dreams dont' really seem to be anything important, they're just about whatever it was i did that day or i was thinking about but the really weird thing is when i dream. my dreams start BEFORE i fall asleep. i lie in bed for hours and hours and i can't sleep. i got to bed about one or two AM and i don't fall asleep untill three or four. but i start to have bits and peices of dreams before i actually fall aleep. it's like my dreams are becoming more and more powerful. i should really do something with my friends to get my mind off things, but...it seems like no one wants to do anything with me. i'm having a really lonely summer and everyone thinks it's because i like to be alone but i don't, i can't stand not having any friends around all the time, sometimes it seems like all i have to keep me company is my computer and my PS2. adn then the music i listen to when i'm feeling lonely only makes me feel lonlier, right now i'm listening to "Lonely People" by America. i'm getting so many songs stuck in my head at one time, nothing can really get my mind off it except playing RO and killing stuff with my knight, but i can't log on so i have nothing to get my mind off it. maybe i should try to draw again, that might help me to atlest focus my thoughts a bit. *sigh* oh well, i guess i'm just try to find soemthign to do.

      I had a dream that I could fly I can feel each moment as time goes by We'd never be too far away ,You would always be here, I heard you say  I never thought Thought that it would be our last goodbye (our last goodbye.) I still can dream That one day love will fall out from the sky  Do you still remember all the time that has gone by? (do you believe?) Do you still believe that love can fall out from the sky? If from where you're standing, you can see the sky above I'll be waiting for you, if you still believe in love (do you still believe?)  Find a way to bring back yesterday Find a way to love I hope we stay When tomorrow becomes today Love will find a way  I'll be waiting for you, in my heart you are the one If I cannot find you, I will look up to the sun (do you believe, do you believe?) If from where you're standing, you can see the sky above I'll be waiting for you, if you still believe in love  Do you believe? Do you believe?  Do you still remember all the time that has gone by? Do you still believe that love can fall out from the sky? If from where you're standing, you can see the sky above (do you believe?) I'll be waiting for you, if you still believe in love  Do you believe?

      It starts with One thing, I don't know why, It doesn't even matter how hard you try, Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme, To explain in due time, All I know, Time is a valuable thing, Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings, Watch it count down 'till the end of the day, The clock ticks life away, It's so unreal, You didn't look out below, Watch the time go right out the window, Trying to hold on, Didn't even know, I wasted it all, Just to watch you go, I kept everything inside, And even know I tried, It all fell apart, What it meant to be, Will eventually be, A memory of a time, when , I tried so hard and got so far, But in the end, It doesn't even matter, I had to fall, To lose it all, But in the end, It doesn't even matter, One thing, i don't know why, It doesn't even matter how hard you try, Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme, To remind myself How I tried so hard... In spite the way you were mocking me, Acting like i was part of your property, Remembering all the times you fought with me, I'm surprised it got so far, Things aren't the way they were before, You wouldn't even recognize me anymore, Not that you knew me back then, But it all comes back to me, In the end...You kept everything inside, And even know i tried it all fell apart, What it meant to me, will, Eventually, be a memory of a time when, I tried so hard and got so far, But in the end, It doesn't even matter, I had to fall, To lose it all, But in the end, It doesn't even matter, I've put my trust in you, Pushed as far as I can go, For all this, There's only one thing you should know, I've put my trust in you, Pushed as far as i can go, For all this, There's only one thing you should know... I tried so hard and got so far, But in the end, It doesn't even matter, I had to fall, To lose it all, But in the end, It doesn't even matter

      "death comes for us all Oroku Sake, but something far worse comes for you, for when you die it will be...  without honor."  -Splinter  more rhythmic emotions about nostalgia, growing old, letting go, and fear of change may be upcoming, but maybe not. it kinda depends on how much FFVIII pulls me in.
