      I went to the little lockin at Magic Springs last night and we were there from 10 at night till 4 in the morning. It was not worth the money. That's messed up that it cost $17 when I bought a pass. That's why I bought a pass, so I didn't have to pay to get in. I'm really tired today. I'm kind of disapointed that Jaclyn was out of town this weekend. We were supposed to go bowling tonight but she had to go to El Dorado. I would have rather gone bowling than to Magic Springs. I think this chick at the church was stalking me. I was walking alone, thinking about stuff, and she saw me and left her friends to walk with me. I had not even met her before tonight but, it turns out she was one of my ex girlfriends best friends sister. How ironic? Oh well, she was pretty cool. Then when we got back to the church we watched t.v. Well, most everybody slept. Jenna tried but I kept her awake, he he he. Jenna and I finally got to talk, I'm glad I got that stuff off my chest. Thanks Jenna. Jaclyn would be proud of me today, I slept from 6:30 this morning to 3:00 this afternoon. I'm still really tired though so I think all I need to say has been said. L8r.

      I'm getting so frustrated with my dad. He's making me so mad. I sat up last night till about 1:00 because I was so mad. Well, our house is for sale. I guess they still want to think that I'm moving too. My parents are trying to make me feel bad for breaking the "family" up. Family my a$$. Yesterday I went to my moms house and played some music. There were so many people there. we had about 5 or 6 guitar players, 3 or 4 bass players, and 2 or 3 drummers. We think we may have a band formed though. Me, a guy named Matt who plays guitar, his brother who will play either bass or guitar, and Dean who will play whichever intrument Matt's brother doesn't play. Dean is awesome. He went to Juliard for four years playing bass but if you give him a flute, he would probly know how to play it. It's early and I need to go to band practice soon so I better stop writting.
