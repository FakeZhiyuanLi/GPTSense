      He drapes himself in the Queen's speech/reaches deep into my soul and dips his thoughts/lots of red-white-and-blue till i bleed the panther's blood/flood my third worldness with a righteousness only fit for the core because the perpherys got no soul/so im told/its survival of the fittest baby/maybe your people should get get their heads out of the asses he tells me/he hit a nerve with that one and im stunned/and its done/as in over before it begun.

      She whispers her emerald clad words through the wind-blown leaves and i wonder if summer is here to stay/to pull me up from my roots and linger through my day into eternal nothingness/i dream away my nights and when i wake it all seems surreal su-real so-real that i can taste his goodbye/little ms.sanchez dreads away my worries and soon i can't remember why i went into that room/all that im left with is the smell of the grass and the sound of the lawn mower/the hummmmiiinnnngg....

      He dug himself so deep within my bones that        when he leaves,  it rains and my arthritic legs begin to shake        they take              my thoughts of him and rattle them against this broken spirit but my essence will linger on with him no matter where         he goes because be-cause-bcause-cause he dug himself so deep within my bones that when he leaves,  it rains and my arthritic legs begin to shake        they take              my thoughts of him and wrap them in a warm blanket, so that my essense will linger on with him no matter where he goes.

      things have a way of falling apart no matter how perfect, how together theey may appear. its like theres this internal mechanism that goes into destruction mode after  certain amount of time. i think its just not humaly feasible to not have things somehow fu(k up...so im trying to avoid people after once having a nice converation because they'll just never be able to recreate that and neither will i. will keep you posted...

      It's already late. late in the summer, late in the day and although i know its not too late in life, the heaviness of the air tonight makes me feel like it is. just got through doubting whether the case i cited, in the memo i wrote, stands for the proposition that i thought it stood for. what a strange feeling, theres almost nothing worse than self doubt. the way its swift sharpness cuts into your heart. it reminds me of when i used to get scrapped up as a kid and not really remembering where the scrap came from but feeling a sudden sting and then noticing the bright redness slowly oozing through the surface. thats doubt. i sometimes want to be between the pauses...between the words...between the sentences. to never know what comes next rather than being a predictor of the court of just(ice). always thinking always pontificating.always feeling like im the middle of a chess game trying to stratergize my next move by predicting your next three moves. playing the devil's advocate or the advocate's devil because im suppose to believe in grays.all shades of grays because without grays, we're all just as good as dead. but today i can't seem to see the grays because all i taste is the redness shattering through my self-confidence.

      i dreamt of you last night, our laughter lying in the tangled arms of a willow tree free, yet cupped in the palms of the star-strung sky spirits buring in the luciferase of a fire fly  i dreamt of you last night, as we slipped on our dancing shoes our thoughts tango-ed in a midsummer night's dream.

      i couldn't help but think of my father when i saw him/ his 55 years of life experience on the E train, crouched up against the orange plastic seat/ feet so tired from carrying around his life story/ glory of days past when he was somebody's son, brother, father/ somebody's somebody/ before he was a nobody/ clenched in death's fist as the 5-by-6 cardboard box closes in on him/ dim, the stars burn the night away into his destiny/ but this morning his sleep is deep as he dreams never to wake again.

      "The more I study religions the more I am convinced that man never worshipped anything but himself." Sir Richard Francis Burton (1821 - 1890)  The problem with institutionalized religion is that it's nothing more than a means to oppress a large number of people.  First the Catholic church with its scandals, then Islam with its fundamentalism and Hinduism is not free and clear.  For centuries, we have adhered to the caste system to persecute Dalits, or "untouchables."  The whole idea of a person being an "untouchable" is absolutely despicable and we should be ashamed of ourselves! Hinduism, what started as an incredible philosophy, has quickly turned into nothing more than  a heirachical structure for exploiting what really is the "underclass." Think about it, the idea that we are reincarnated into someone or something based on our karma, or past deeds, basically prevents people from really questioning their positions in life. Why would I think that I deserve better if everything I have now is really just based on good or bad things I did in a past life?  And who but the priests, the Brahmins, that created the caste system luckily end up at the top, coincidence? Highly unlikely! So what does this make me, an atheist or humanist?  Check out: http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2004/07/10/india9051.htm  "Such evil deeds could religion prompt." Lucretius (96 BC - 55 BC), De Rerum Natura

      Just once before I die I want to climb up on a tenement sky to dream my lungs out till I cry then scatter my ashes thru the Lower East Side. So let me sing my song tonight let me feel out of sight and let all eyes be dry when they scatter my ashes thru the Lower East Side. From Houston to 14th Street from Second Avenue to the mighty D here the hustlers & suckers meet the faggots & freaks will all get high on the ashes that have been scattered thru the Lower East Side. There’s no other place for me to be There’s no other place that I can see there’s no other town around that brings you up or keeps you down no food little heat sweeps by fancy cars & pimps’ bars & juke saloons & greasy spoons make my spirits fly with my ashes scattered thru the Lower East Side A thief, a junkie I’ve been committed every known sin Jews and Gentiles…Bums and Men of style-run away child police shooting wild mother’s futile wails pushers making sales dope wheelers & cocaine dealers smoking pot streets are hot & feed off those who bleed to death all that’s true all that’s true all that is true but this ain’t no lie when I ask that my ashes be scattered thru the Lower East Side. So here I am, look at me I stand proud as you can see pleased to be from the Lower East a street fighting man a problem of this land I am the Philosopher of the Criminal Mind a dweller of prison time a cancer of Rockefeller’s ghettocide this concrete tomb is my home to belong to survive you gotta be strong you can’t be shy less without request someone will scatter your ashes thru the Lower East Side. I don’t wanna be buried in Puerto Rico I don’t wanna rest in long island cemetery I wanna be near the stabbing shooting gambling fighting & unnatural dying & new birth crying so please when I die don’t take me far away keep me near by take my ashes and scatter them thru out the Lower East Side.

      Plath once said that she refused to write about the rain because it seemed like anytime there was a storm, a million poems about the rain would flood into journals and magazines the following week. Thats peculiar and so I guess i won't comment on the weather today other than for some strange reason it reminds me of my last summer in puerto rico. although it never  really  rained there, we had so many sun showers, where it would drizzle for a bit but the sun would be shining. it was just enough rain to cool the hot afternoon sun and left this sort of crip, clear smell, like the ocean smells. i guess i AM talking about the rain, ok ill stop. isn't it funny how you can be so close to someone at a point in your life and years later, you wonder what you would have in common with them if you were to meet for the first time now?  Thats happened to me alot recently and for some reason those people always leave me feeling like somehow i've changed and its such a tragedy. and i wonder, how can you not change? since high school, since college...and if you haven't changed, have you really experienced anything new, anything different, anything at all? instead of welcoming change, we shy away from it, like at some point in our lives we were so perfect and anything that deviates from that is somehow terrible. i don't want to presume to ever be perfect so as not to allow myself to invent and reinvent myself and maybe along the way i'll somehow find my trueness. but it seems like "change" is viewed in such a negative way, like " oh, you've changed " but if i were always the same, what would be the fun in that? Change is a great thing, just like a rain storm after a beautiful sunny weekend--so if you're bummed by the rain, how will we ever have flowers if it doesn't rain?

      I had a strange experience today, for lack of a better description.  So someone introduced me to this attorney, 60-something, Caucasian, male (i'm going some where with this hold on) and he says to me, "so, what are you doing in law school?" So i go on this 15 minute schpeel about wanting to be a litigator and ultimately working towards being a diplomat, blah blah...and he says to me "why, do you want to be a lawyer?" So, I'm thinking, wasn't this guy just here for the las 15 minutes of conversation or was I thinking all those thoughts in my head and I never spoke them out loud? Perplexed, I ask "what do  you mean?" He says, "you should consider being a dancer, maybe ballet.  You know when I was in law school, the girls didn't look like you girls do now--they looked like men."   I'm in utter disbelief and I kinda give him a nervous chuggle. He starts up again and I interrupt him with some self-deprecating humor before he goes on any more by saying, "I would love to work for Calvin Klein, but they think I'm not skinny enough" I can sense the other partner give a sigh of relief as his embarassed face contorted back as he says "lets go meet everyone else."  He lips the words "I'm so sorry" as he hurries the other guy off.    Do I appear inapt or should I just write it off as a futile attempt to complement me? (And to all you lawschool peeps: If Title VII is running thru your head, you need a vacation! haha)

       i want to breathe so hard until my lungs collapse/until i can no longer contain myself in my skin/because i've truly lived/lived beyond these hyphened boundries and societal confines/till i find myself without you breathing life into me/till i cut all these strings that tug at my sleeves/till i no longer feel responsible for your happiness (or sadness)/till i can cup my soul into the palm of my hands and blow it away/till you no longer need to be told that everything is okay/till i no longer need to tell you everything is okay/till we find a balance between our seperate existence/till you stop looking to me for comfort/till we fall (back?) in love/till you find yourself outside of me/till we both understand it can never go back to the way we thought it was/till i don't want to go back to how it was/till i stop minimizing our time to three months/till you carve out our own destiny/till we actually do all the things we said we would do/till you stop trying to live and just live instead/till i stop trying to try/till we learn to love each other for who we've become,

       "Don't limit a child to your own learning, for he was born in another time."~Rabbinical Saying  i said good-bye to manix last night because he's leaving for thailand this afternoon for a whole month. for some reason it was the hardest thing for me to do. i kept telling him how much i'm going to miss him and he responded "i'll miss you too." but for some reason, i don't think he gets just how much i'll miss him. i never really thought i would get this way about him, especially since hes not even my own child but oddly enough i guess it really doesn't matter. recently he's been saying phrases like "what do you think you're tough?" (when we wrestle) and although at first i laugh because its funny coming from him, i actually was a bit taken back by how much he's grown. when i first met him, he was this tiny lil three-year old who couldn't tie his own shoes and now he's a six year old who travels more than anyone else i know. suddenly i feel old. i feel like i'm saying and feeling all these things that my parents say and feel about us. this lil guy has become such a huge part of my life its scary. its scary to feel these emotions for someone else, let alone someone else's child. it makes you feel so vulnerable and sometimes when he's going away i find myself thinking things like "make sure you don't forget the sunscreen or his sunglasses" and i bite my tongue with a sudden realization that i'm not his mother or father.  manix has taught me so much about myself and about life in general. he's taught me that its okay to get your feathers ruffled once in awhile, patience (he's just a kid), acceptance, humility (when he often seems to ask better questions than me), to be curious (its okay not to know everything), to laugh more, to play tag, to giggle, to hug, to blow cootie kisses, to take risks, to try new things, to be less selfish, to share, to be honest, to treat people like i want to be treated (not to talk down to him just because he's a kid), to take time out because life really is too short, to.....love unconditionally.

      for some reason everytime that i move out of the house it seems like the first. when i moved out for college it tore apart my lungs and i felt alone and i had this gaspy feeling like i was breathing underwater. its strange, maybe that was the same feeling that brought me back home during law school but once again i have choosen to leave them or maybe they have made the choice for me. i spent last night just lying in bed thinking about them and about chiku and feeling this intense sense of gratitude for having the life that i have. looking back it seems like there was never a time that i felt i lacked something, be it material or theoritical. sometimes i wish dad had been around more but had that been the case, we might still be living in india and i might not be feeling the way i do now. he is by far one of the most amazing men in this world. i know that everyone says that kinda stuff about their dad but sometimes i really feel like he's unreal. by far the most open-minded, free- thiking person i know. his creativity and courageousness is uncanny; how many people can drop everything at the age of 40 and move their whole life to a foreign country and be left with no roots? I can't do that at 23 let alone at 40!  as for mom, i am so fu(king amazed at how shes done it. raising us two by herself with dad gone most of the time, her career and well just about everything else. for all those times that i resent her for not letting me go, whatever that means, there are an infinte more times that she has been the most amazing woman that i have ever met. her strength, her independence (of mind also), her resiliance, her rebelious spirit, her beauty. finally, chiku. where can i even being except that i really think we were suppose to be twins. i feel like he understands me better than anyone in this world and even more importantly, he accepts me with all my faults and hangups. he has been my constant through everything and i wish sometimes he knew just how much i love him. by far the most articulate, creative, radical, humble, talented, knowledgable person that i know. i can go on forever, but in short-your family is all you really got and with them, ive got it all.

      sometimes i want to crawl into your thoughts and stay awhile/file myself into your memory card because its safer that way/stay there till we forget where we came from but moreso where we're going/flowing in and out from lives past/last night i dreamt of her hands/the calloused roughness that caressed us/her 40 years multiplied by the number of children she raised/fazed out in their lives/but i/i dreamt of our life past/the dusty streets...the stench of cow dung/hung over us like a badge of pride/you running the 100 meter-dash/images flash before my mind/our superhero dad indulging our American dreams with toys for thoughts/you trying to fill shoes too big/digs deep into my soul/role that mom was dad&amp;mom must have been tough/rough with us chasing imaginary ideals but rougher when they came crashing down/last night i dreamt of her hands/flowing in and out from lives past.
