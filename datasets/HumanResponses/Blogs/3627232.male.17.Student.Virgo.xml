         Me and my good friend were in CD Plus and what should catch my eye in the electronica/dance section, but Prodigy Presents: The Dirtchamber Sessions Volume One. This cd is mostly Liam Howlett mixin' it up real good on his turntables. The songs don't have names and that's because they're made with excerpts from other songs. Overall I'm saying that it's a great cd, however, I am still eagerly anticipating the release of Always Outnummbered, Never Outgunned as I was told that it was supposed to be out on June 1, 2004, but was later told that it's been pushed back to July 25th. Ah well, I can wait . . . I guess.

         Zim (green one) and G.I.R. (little robot)   Ladies and gentlemen (if I can say that), I would like to take a moment to make a small tribute to a very great and comical cartoon known as   Invader Zim  . This cartoon is just so hilarious, I can barely begin to describe it. It's almost as random as my overall thought patterns.  Invader Zim is about an alien of the "Irkon" race. They are a race of aliens that basically invade other planets. Some planets include the planet of the largest most comfortable couch in the universe, or the planet of the man eating rats. Zim, a reject of his people, is selected to go on a "special mission" merely because he screwed up the last invasion. Zim's mission is to take over a planet thought to not exist, but much to the "Tall Ones" surprise, Zim ends up on Earth. Before leaving, he is given his S.I.R. (I forget what it stands for, it's been a while), however, Zim's is made out of a broken one from the garbage, and the brain is made using a screw, some gum and some string. It springs to life and calls itself G.I.R. . . . and it's a complete moron.  While on Earth, Zim encounters the one person who believes aliens exist, his name is Dib. The whole show is basically Zim and Dib trying to foil each other as Zim tries to take over the Earth.  This show was banned from TV a while ago because it was "To violent for children." However, some channels still put it on. If you have the Nick-toons channel then you should be able to watch it, or you could try and find it using some form of downloading utility, such as K-Lite (because Kazaa is for suckas).  Watch the show or go to hell . . . I'm sorry, that was uncalled for. Watch the show or go to hell, please.

         This is me in "demon form." Ooooooo, scary.   Lo and behold, I now have a blog-thinger. I saw everyone else doing it so I thought I'd join in the fun. What am I going to post on this, who knows, I sure don't. It'll most likely be something that I only remember having when I'm bored . . . which is a lot.  And now for a nice and random song lyric quote from the song Baby's Got a Temper by Prodigy: "We love rohypnol, she's got rohypnol, we take rohypnol, just forget it all!!!"

      I sit here bored to tears It's been long since my last hour of rest But sleep is so boring, yes very boring So why bother with that? Although it wouldn't be anymore boring than now So why do I keep on resisting this urge? Because I pride myself in this little accomplishment Or maybe I'm to tired to sleep Perhaps staying awake will help me dream Like rest for the imagination The longer I'm up, the better the rest And then my dreams will be full and vibrant Not like this very dull reality Or maybe I'm wrong.

      Oh sweet exilir, you'll keep me up All I must do is sip from my cup For I grow weary, I need to sleep But a promise was made that I will keep I promised myself to stay awake all day So I refuse to listen to what sleep has to say I'm going to win, and sleep will not I found your trap, I won't get caught Though comfortable my bed does look And inviting is that boring book No, I will refuse you sleep For I have a promise to keep.

      It's been late, very late Yes very late indeed In fact, I've been out all night Sleep is not my need!  I arrive home in my mighty chariot I refuse to go to bed My self-induced insomnia May as well warp my head.  But I care not, for my energy is boundless! And I will stay ever awake! Sleep is not my master My will it shall never take!  So to sleep I will say, Leave me be, no time for you For I've been out late And now the day is new.

      Time changes nothing, only interaction does Time keeps on going, but interactions manipulate Time doesn't change people, experiences do And I wonder, have I changed over time? Of course I have, but because of the people I met Their interactions changed me, not time.

      I sit alone and long I ponder, My head filled with many thoughts of wonder, Where did it start? Why are we here? What keeps it going, year after year? When will it end? How will it end? Such thoughts a mind can't mend, For to know such things can not be done We are beings of leisure, we must have fun Let philosophers worry of such things For they are the "enlightened" human beings.  But yet I can't help it, I must know When we all die, where do we go? Is it a moment when we feel much joy? Or do we become some sick god's toy? It's to much for my mind to bear Yet deeper I think, why do I care? I have life to live, I should explore There are many things behind every door Yet here I sit, I ponder and ponder, Constanly thinking, always I'll wonder.  Philosophers keep thinking, and what for? To have a poster put on someone's door? Life is to be lived, not put into text One writes a book and what shall come next? Fanaticism, and irrational thought Often that is sadly the plot We have come so far, but where have we gone? Plans of war, battle and conquest are drawn They say it's necessary, it's what people need Are they so blind to their own greed?  There is no perfect way I'm afraid So I shall remain here in the shade For I am a being of leisure, it's what I do I refuse to deny it if that is what's true I'm not lazy, I just often wonder And so I lay here and ponder Never will I be able to conclude Why it is we have this mortal feud And soon enough, I'll have forgot Everything that came to me at this spot.

      I stay awake at night My sleep is what I fight For I am not ready to see What my hidden thoughts may be For that is what dreams reveal The things you try to conceal Deep in the mind they dwell Confines of personal hell But they are things no one will know For deep into my mind, no one shall go.

      The heroes don their armour Soon battle they will see Never knowing what shall take place The peasants shout with glee.  The walk is long But they press on Walking to their death Soon they'll be gone.  Encounters on the way are few An old man in a cloak of black "You would do well to hear me heroes, If your lives you value, go back."  But the heroes went on Ignoring the man they saw And reached their destination, Soon they'd meet fate's law.  They enter the ruins And their swords they draw For they see a figure ahead, The old man whom they saw.  "I warned you," said he, "But you ignored me." He starts to wave his hands, "Now true power you will see."  The cave is lit up The man's form begins to change, The cave closes behind And now the man looks strange.  He has been twisted by evil And his form is now true A demon stands before them A hero shouts, "I'll run you through!"  But no matter how hard they try All efforts are made in vain The hero's begin to fall The demon laughs at the pain.  And now it is done Ignoring warning was their flaw, The demon heads for the town All will soon fall to fate's law.

      Well, I have no poems to post as of now, but whenever I feel inspired to create, rest assured that I will zoom here as fast as I can.  Until then,  Allow your mind to always fly Or see your imagination die.

      Pictures in my mind randomly appear Some seem so far away, others very near Some are truly great Some filled with hate Some make me whole Some tear my soul But in the end they serve me well For all pictures have stories to tell.      Note: It's been a while since last I wrote a poem. It seems I can't find inspiration unless I'm really tired,  funny how that works.

      On this night I look upon the moon And I see its light bursting through the clouds Reaching my eyes and burning through my mind Nights such as these are rare indeed I feel as though I should stop and stare But I move on, for I've places to be now And yet it calls me with its captivating light And then I wish that I were a creature of the night.
