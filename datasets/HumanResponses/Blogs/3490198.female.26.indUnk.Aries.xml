      I´m sure not feeling anything like that here! First thing I heard was rain knocking on my window! I got this little room right under the roof so it´s one of those dormer windows which I like BUT my room itself is a mess.  (Can you say: SMALL AS F*CK?)  I didn´t plan on staying here for that long but life always has a way to turn on you and mess it all up anyway. So I´m not complaining.  (Nah, forget that..I AM FED UP!!!)   Anyway, it´s been raining all day long which always gets me into this I-don´t-want-to-see-nor-hear-anyone-just-leave-me-the-fuck-alone-kinda-mood. So I´ve been trying to make the best of it and took a hot bath and...ehhem...that´s it! I got my credentials out because I need to get them translated and there it is again: that feeling, that damm-if-i-hadn´t-been-that-lazy-i-might-have-been-more-than-average-feeling! So I just took them out and put them aside on the closet. I don´t want to deal with that feeling today. If I did I might as well slit open my stomach and play with my giblets  (I had to look that up and it had this little extra added about it being used with chickens)  a little!  I was close to calling my ex yesterday night but again I didn´t have the guts  (and that´s where the giblets part comes up again)  as I don´t want to deal with the feeling of rejection. I rather stay in my little chances-are-good-that-we-will-be-together-again fairytail world, at least for now.

      Boring day. I actually did just lay in the sun reading a book, had a quick look at the Formula 1 this afternoon, which was boring as well  *Michael Schumacher sucks by the way and I don´t like him which got me into an argument with my father but that is nothing new*  and now I´m online again,  *i need to get a life*  trying to find out about this blog thing. HELP!!!!  I tried to avoid the news programms today and I almost succeeded, just caught a glimpse of the hostage thing in Saudi-Arabia and that puts my mood somewhere really below anything. I can´t stand the world nowadays. Don´t you just wish to put all the fucked-up leaders of this world, terrorists, gay-haters, religious extremists on one island and let them blow up each others´ heads? I´m so sick and tired of it all...really am!

      the first thing I got to hear this morning apart from you shouldn´t sleep that long!  *can´t expect me to say H. P. back at you because I`m just not religious like that which is getting me another "you_bad_kid" comment*  But it´s like those two things belong together: getting up early and happy pentecost, that´s the catholic way I suppose! Goddammit  *yeah I just said that*  i can´t wait to get my money and visa together so I can moooooove... Nothing planned for today so I´ll probably spend the rest of the day in the garden reading whatever comes my way. If  *let me come up with a name that´ll tell you everything and nothing*   Mr. Music   *yeah, how creative, but hey, I just up* gets home from his show early enough and calls, I might catch a train and get me some. We are nothing but friends that indulge in some fun for grown-ups every now and then and I wouldn´t want it any other way.  *yeah, yeah, shame on me*

      Alright, here I am.  *applause please*   Lowbrow me had the intellectual capacity to create my own blog! Let´s see where this is going. Does one do a formal introduction of him/herself? Anyway, I´m not yet in the mood for that but I´ll be back with that later---maybe!

      i don´t have much to write although there are all kinds of thoughts floating through my mind today. I can´t hold on to them. Michael somehow made it back to the surface but that probably comes with the fact that it´s almost a year..a whole damm year. Definitely was the summer of my life. (But hell, I´m not that old yet. There should be some more summers of my life coming up. I hope, but not convinced)  Strange, how he totally had me head over heels and then falling like forever untill that painfull  SMACK  when I hit reality again. I´m not totally over it, but it´s not as bad and somewhere my pride has a little to do with it also. I mean, not one word, nothing...I really don´t think I´m such a bad person. I ain´t a van Gogh, probably more of a Kandinsky  (oh yeah, Tionne,I KNOW what you are thinking...shut it! lol)  You just have to look a little untill you get the "aaaah" effect- step back, look, step closer, look again....a messed up picture, but pretty pretty.  (Did I just compare myself to a Kandinsky picture? REALLY!! I´m not that conceited...)   Anyway, that Kandinsky painting is off to watch soccer now...PORTUGAL! PORTUGAL!

      I wasn´t in the mood to blog lately but now that I am at work I might as well waste some time giving you the update on what´s been happening in my oh-so-interesting-life lately. Remember the 250,- bucks I had to pay for my credentials translations? That bitch had the nerve to make a mistake in it! I mean, c´mon I paid fucking 250,- EUR for that shyt and you make a mistake? Anyway, I called them up last Thursday and they said they would send me the corrected stuff again. Haven´t received anything so far though! I give them untill Thursday! And while we at it (the college thing I mean), I found out that I will have to do the CUNY Assessment test before I´ll be accepted. WHOOOHOOOO!! Checking that shyt out gave me the creeps. The Reading and Writing exams should work out all right for me ( Yes, I am conceited enough to say that my English skills are pretty good for a non-native speaker)  but the mathmatics part got me the shock of my life. DARN IT! I hate mathmatics, always have and always will...It was the luckiest day of my life when I had finished highschool and thought "That´s it! No more maths for me!" Boy, was I wrong. I looked at those example tests and I don´t rememeber shit. Nothing, Niente, Nix....So I guess I`ll just have to sit my azz down and learn that stuff again.  (Not good for my momentarily bad mood at all)  Dorene said she would ask her sister for advice  (she´s got something to do with some kinda college in NYC)  and I hope she´ll be able to help me a little. Met my girl Julia on saturday and we  ( okay, I..)  went shopping. I had to get some stuff for our annual Sales Meeting this coming weekend. Well, I was lucky and got me a white suit with a red blouse and some red shoes .(No, I´m NOT the "little black dress" kinda girl)  It´ll do just fine. We had some nachos and later some ice- cream  (okay, again:  I  had the nachos and the ice-cream! Thx girl for giving me a bad conscience again..lol)  and did the shopping in between. But the best part of the day was the "LEGALIZE IT" demonstration that took place that day. Okay, I´m all for it...it´s not worse than booze BUT damm it, can´t you do it with some style??  (Don´t get me wrong, you are a punk? it´s all cool with me! you are a rasta? That´s even kooler with me! So that´s NOT what I mean!)  Please be at least able to hold a decent speech! You expect people to listen and even be convinced by what you have to say when you can´t even get a straight sentence out? YOU ARE PLAYING STRAIGHT INTO THEIR HANDS! Like I told Julia :" Don´t fucking get stoned before holding that damm speech!"  (rolls eyes)  Anyway, we had fun, esp. watching some 15-year-old-Harry-Potter-look-a-likes feeling pretty damm kool with their green spray hair color and palestinian cloth. Impressive!   Oh yeah, Germany DIDN´T make it to the next round and I was devastated for a day or two but it´s all good now and I´m all for Portugal now.  (Did I mention that I have a thing for Figo´s hairy arms? Turns me on tremendously)   They kicked England out and that was fun to watch. FORCA FORCA PORTUGAL!!!!!   ...by the way, my feet are cold...i´m wearing flip-flops but the weather doesn´t fit....

      we are Danish dynamite>...   (oh, how I love those totally creative cheers during the European Championships)  Apart from soccer here my latest vents about certain things I´ve seen or heard lately:  While Julia and me were talking on the phone the other day we stumbled over a new show at MTV  (you know how it goes: "Girl, are u watching that and that...switch..you gotta see that..") . The show is probably not new to the people from the US but we take a while to get those here. Anyway, it´s a show about plastic surgery. People get plastic surgery: ON M.U.S.I.C.TV! I mean, C`MON! And it´s not even the plastic surgery thing that is soooo ridiculous and in a way sad, it´s the people that WANT that shyt. Okay, there was this really big girl that came across really nice and down to earth and she wanted her stomach reduced so she could lose some weight.Okay, I´d still say try a diet and some sports but if she tried that and this is her last chance I´m all for it. Her reason was something  (I might not quote her word for word but the meaning was the same)  like:"I don´t want to be a barbie. I just want tbe able to function in society." I get it, I understand you! Go for it, but consider the risks as well. Then there were these two girls that looked like 25-30 while only being 19 and 20 with their boobs done already and looking absolutly fine to me ( I mean, I´m not too much into that All-American beauty ideal but they were okay) . Well, those two chicks get their noses, lips and who knows what else done. They consider a playmate the ideal woman. I MEAN, C`MON..a playmate??? silicone and blonde streaks, chicks that all look the same? Well, Julia and me had a good laugh about that and at those two airheads as well " I hope my future career plans will now all be fullfilled..."  (Julia and me get excited thinking that they might come out with college plans or something) .."I want to be in Playboy and find a guy" WHOOOHOOOOOO!!!GO FOR IT GIRL!!!  (imagine me rolling my eyes now?)  Don´t get me wrong, plastic surgery is not always a bad thing and I have to admit I´ve been thinking about it for a while as well  (and believe me the thing I want to get done really is understandable)  but my college education comes first. NOBODY is perfect and I hate it that teenage girls (and boys as well) get manipulated through the media and the whole fucking society to look like runway models, or in the case mentioned, like playboy bunnies. Those chicks are all made-up, they wear make-up...much make-up and most of the times they are really pretty girls but I doubt you´d notice anyone of them on the streets. They get pimples too! It upsets me because I KNOW how it is..My Mum`s looking gorgeous and I´ve been told that from early on and I always compared myself to her and later on to the models and video chicks as well. Damm, I was dieting my azz of as a teenager and it came close to aneroxia (sp?) one time. I still watch my weight today but I´m okay. I`m about 5`8 - 5`9 weighing 125lbs. I`m fine. I got a some junk in the trunk, so what? I just hate the fucking manipulative media and that whole shyt. There´s more than looks and those fade anyway sooner or later and if you haven´t worked on anything else but that you´ll end up pretty fucked up!  (yeah, my feminist side comes through)

      I called the translation agency today to ask whether they might be able to just mail me the translations as it´s hard for me to get down there at the moment but unfortunatly that isn´t possible .(I already was kinda pissed at that, but wait it´s getting even better)  I took the chance to ask them about the full amount I need to pay   (they charge by line so it wasn´t totally clear)  and that bitch tells me : 250,- EUR  (yeah, it´s about the same in USD, maybe even more)  and I went like "WHHHHAAAATT??" I mean c´mon, it´s just two credentials,not too much written on there apart from the subjects with the grades. Heeeelloooo??? So I´m pissed. I need to pay about the same amount again to get that stuff evaluated and then another 150 bucks for the TOEFL test. Whooohooo...college expenses kicking in even before I  applied.  (by the way I´m also pissed at the fact that I have to pay double as much as Americans but hey, I can deal with that)  Can´t fucking stop me anymore!  (I´m starting to think about making a little "help_me_go_to_college_page with my account No. etc. Hey, if ya´ll just give me one dollar each,huh?? what cha think? 50 cent? huh? huh?)   The weather here still sucks and soccer still rules. Portugal won against Spain yesterday and I liked that.  (nothing against Spain but I just favour the underdog and apart from that my hormones have been running wild over Mr. Figo and I KNOW it´s just the hormones and the fact that I haven´t been getting laid lately)  Tonight it´s France I will support and tomorrow night Germany. See, I´m not all that patriotic when it comes to soccer .(just a little)  I talked to Dee but nothing too interesting happening in NYC either. I love talking to Dee and I miss her and Hugh and everybody else. But it also always leaves me with that feeling of being homesick lately. *sigh*   I was jealous of my girl Tionne on saturday for a minute because she went out to a "consumer party" and damm, I need to get out and get drunk and stoned as well. TIIOOONNNEEEE! LET`S GET OUR AZZES OUT THERE SOON! I miss partying with you girlfriend! Really do!

      and it´s not even funny anymore. That thing has to go!!!! Germany played their second game today against Latvia and it turned out 0:0. Not really good. We absolutly HAVE to win the next game otherwise we are out of the tournament which would make the world tumble down on us....REALLY! ( well, at least some have the nerve to say that it would harm our economy badly...could it really become even worse?)   Anyway, apart from that it´s cold as fuck here again  (what the hell is wrong with our summer?)  and I´m miserable again, but at least I got an excuse as the hormones are really kicking in on me.  Good thing that happened: I got an extra bonus at work. Whooohooo, another 500.00 bucks into my college account. I actually didn´t want to open that envelope because I thought I might be fired .(Hey, seriously,they could have found out about my internet chilling time half of the day)   My boss is still a creep and I could have killed him yesterday. Okay, it´s a stupid little secretary story but as I absolutly need the money for college and my little town has nothing much to offer I have to go through this 5 days a week. Okay, I take a phone call from a customer, she tells me her name and the hospital and that she is interested in one of our products. I put her through to the guy in charge for that town. He tells our boss later that so and so called but didn´t want to tell her for which department she needs the product nor her phone number. She would call back. Well, guess what! IT`S MY FAULT! My boss wants to get right after her but no number and I AM RESPONSIBLE for that! HUH? I put that bitch through to some guy. He should have taken her number. Anyway, he´s getting at me like I´m some stupid little bitch not knowing shit. Yeah right....FUCK YOU!!!! Yeah, my job is the SHIT!!!!!

      that acknowledges my  brilliant  writing. Introducing Ms. ANA THEMA. I read a little in her blog  (for a few minutes only though because you know the old story of my Explorer crashing but what I´ve seen is a really superb blog!)   Of course you can link me...Homeless introduced me to the slut thing and I´m working hard on it. I`m doing my best.  (I will link back-really-PROMISED!-as soon as I get this thing working straight)   And my girl Tionne send me the quote of the day in her last comment.  (I just had to bring that up front because it´s fucking hilarious)    "The reason why I keep insisting that there was a connection between Al Qaeda and Iraq, eventhough you keep insisting there was none, is, because there was a connection between Al Qaeda and Iraq."  G.W. Bush...  Eheem..yeah..GOT YOU Mr. President....  (it´s not my English skills, is it?)

      Yo Mr. Bush..the truth always comes out sooner or later....questioning you is Anti-American  (who made that word up anyway?)  ? Guess you should have been questioned a lot more.... (by the way that´s where my opinion about soccer being the only time to show some patriotism is right comes in again..)    No al Qaeda, Iraq cooperation The panel said it found "no credible evidence that Iraq and al Qaeda cooperated on attacks against the United States."   (CNN.com)

      okay, remember a few post ago I gave you the insight about my vagina? I guess that thing has to go....I got off the pill because of the hormones but I get the feeling this thing is not doing me any good either. It´s low alloted (right word?)but about the same quantity of hormones that are in a micro pill. Well, it´s been starting to kick in with me..eating too much and kinda on the depressive side again...WHOOOHOO...

      to tell you or myself.  Germany-Holland played 1:1 yesterday and I guess I´m tired from all that shouting, trembling and excitement. We could have won!  (Notice, how I use the "WE" like I and my brothers and 9,000,000 other Germans played in that match as well?? It´s hilarious)  Anyway, one stupid mistake and Ruud van Nistelrooy destroyed our dream. But oh well, we didn´t lose and now after all this years Holland and Germany are friends again:  It´s all good!  I can´t make myself do much today. I should really drive down to that town and pick up my credential translations but damm, I couldn´t stand an hour drive now. Maybe tomorrow...we´ll see...like i said before..I´m a LAZY F*CK!!!   By the way, I realized that it should be Spanish steps and not Spanish stairs but who gives a damm? You know what I meant ,right?

      and darn proud of it! I´ve seen every single game of the European Championship until now and I´ll be out to watch Sweden-Bulgaria in a minute. Tomorrow is D-Day for the Dutch. Yes, soccer is the only time when patriotism should be allowed....let us fight each other with soccer..I think the Americans should get into it..it´s much more fun than actual killing. Believe me!

      Okay, I want to be nice and slut people back. I want to DO them but this html thing is not working with me. But it´s kinda hard to get that thing straight when your explorer crashes every two minutes. Thx Microsoft--NOT!Homeless, I at least linked you in the last headline. Once I find a decent spot to blog from I´ll have my own link list on the left.  So as we are talking about "doing" people, in my case men  (and by the way Tionne: I´m so sorry I didn´t know you were attracted to me in that way lmao* and let me tell you honey if I won´t get P!nk to do me I´ll get you, ok? Hey, IT`S P!NK)  I changed from the pill to the vaginal ring!  (Whoooohooo...you REALLY get all the insight here, well, not the full INSIGHT but anyway...)  So now it´s been in there for about a week and I don´t feel it which I wasn´t too sure about when I first had it my hand but it´s just like it´s not there-at least that´s what my body says. My brain functions differently though. I started thinking about this thing just popping out. I mean, come on....imagine me standing on top of the Spanish stairs in Rome and then that shyt pops out. My thong won´t stop it and the skirt won´t do either. So I´m getting the shock of my life and people turn and stare while that rubber thing slowly jumps down the stairs..one after the other...all the way down... I mean C´mon..it´s the Spanish stairs...me waving after it? Running after it?  So I´m considering another birth control thing...

And I´m sure he´ll sure be the sluts of the sluts soon, the QUEEN..ehhem...KING of all sluts...(hope it works..)  I`m having some seriously strange thoughts about vaginal rings and the Spanish stairs in Rome ...I´ll be back on that later on. PROMISED! ...boss is back....

      I just realized there´s a comment from a stranger in my blog! So I officially have two readers now: Julia ( my girl who´s doing that for me so I get some desperatly needed attention )  and someone called Homeless Comic  (who probably just passed through here by mistake and will never come back..oh yeah, did I mention that I´m in the low self-esteem department today?)  and he actually seems like a kool person .(how could that happen to me??) If I only knew how to link him......

      And hopefully will be out guest for a while. It´s raining today but even summer has a right to feel sad once in a while, I guess. As long as I can wear my little skirts and T-shirts I am more than happy. I guess you can say I´m a summer person through and through! Winter gets me miserable and depressed- not the right partner for me. I don´t even think the two of us can become friends. We just tolerate each other and make it through.  I´ve been really lazy with writing lately but as I only know of one person reading this I don´t think it was bitterly missed. The week itself was a little busy but not in a stressful way. I drove down to a seminar at our main branch on Monday  (why do I always end up driving long distances when the heat is worst?)  and made a stop in a city to hand in my credentials on my way back (you know, that translating stuff)   so me and Julia met there and had a "coffee"  (actually it was a Coke light and Apple-Mineral water because we´d be nuts to drink coffee in the heat) . Of course, something stupid happened to me that had to do with liquids and I messed up my new white capri-like pants  even before  I met Julia so I parked the car in a garage ( 1,50 per hour by the way which I think is a rip off) , got out with my big blue bag in front of me and made my way outside to the nearest steps in front of a store and waited patiently for my girl with my bag resting on my lap. Well, once she arrived we went, always with my bag covering up the mess, to the next store  (which by the way was an expensive one where I usually don´t buy my shit)   and I bought myself a little jeans skirt! Well, I guess every catastrophe has a bad and a good side. I think it was God´s way to tell me that I needed a new skirt!  ( And I´m telling you GOD is a woman!!)  Tuesday was another day at work and some English teaching in the afternoon  (yes, I do have a "pupil" that I help with English which doesn´t mean I won´t make any mistakes here)   and yesterday was a day at work and in the afternoon sun with a good book!  (You see , my life is "THE SHIT")  Well, I talked to Mr. Music and he promised me tickets for Splash festival and so I´m looking forward to some action with my friend Cindy. She needs to get out and being the most cute and helpful  !!!(You all understand sarcasm, right) person I´ll take her with me !!!

      Shock!! I just came home and there was a baby in our living room! Did I miss something? Did one of my brothers hid it somewhere up till now and is now so over-worked to bring it out into the light??? Well, I know it def. is not mine. Fortunately it´s nothing like that! My granny is playing babysitter for the little baby of her niece which would make the baby my great cousin?? Well, some kind of relative anyway. hmmm, what to do with a baby? Eventhough I´m a female that motherly instinct doesn´t really set in automatically with me when I´m confronted with a baby, esp. not when my granny and my brother are standing there watching me and saying stuff like: "Your biological clock is ticking away"! Gives me the creeps. I can´t even get that baby talk out and I don´t want to...haiji..bubu..wink wink...NOT ME! I´m sorry but my child  (if I finally grow up to be ready for one)  won´t be getting that bull from me! SORRY..LEARN TO SPEAK PROPER FROM THE START!!! Guess my little one will have to go through some tough learning with me and will end up totally neurotic!! I´m better with kids when my family is not around though-REALLY!)

      I went to the hairdresser yesterday afternoon  (my boss was even nice enough to let me go half an hour early-whoohoo)  and now I can´t make up my mind whether I like the new colour or not .(Tough being a woman, I know)  First of all, it seems like I´m not the "typical" woman because 1.) I don´t really like going to the hairdresser every second week. I go when it´s starting to or is already looking a little messy. 2.)I HATE to sit there for hours and hours. Unfortunately I have too much hair so I`m usually sitting there at least 2 1/2 hours.( I hate to be told that I have "oh so much hair" every time I go there as well)  3.) I hate buying shoes.  (a little off-topic but as I´m trying to underline my *sarcasm on*oh-so-special-personality *sarcasm off* I might as well put that here as well)  4.) I don´t like shopping too much.I rather go to a store,know what I want, try it on, pay and leave. 5.) I´m not too good at make-up, nail polish and stuff like that and I ABSOLUTELY HATE plucking my eyebrows .(ask Julia!)  6.) I´m just special.  Well, I asked them to take a risk yesterday because I KNOW my hair. It´s very forgiving. So I told them: I want to go blonde again! You´re the hairdresser, you´re supposed to know how and just do! I´m paying you for god´s sake!! They went the safe way anyway  (grumbles)  and did the streak thing so I personally think I look like a zebra! Fortunatly I´m not too vain and it´ll look different in a couple of days.  (I hope)  And next time I want them super-blonde, all over, totally.

      I´m currently online chatting with Cindy  (there´s about 7 people on my list and I know 5 of them in person and only 2 of them are men.lol*)  and we are discussion some guy`s open-relationship that she met in one of the yahoo clubs.  (yeah, we are chit-chatting behind peoples`back) I stopped using yahoo chat and clubs a while ago and now took down my BP page as well. Really, I DON`T want to meet anyone online, I am NOT looking for my soul-mate or a possible sex partner over the internet but it seems that`s what the majority of people are doing. It actually makes me quite sick. HELLO? What do you want me to say when you are sending me a picture of your priceless private parts,huh? OOOh, how nice! Thank you for sharing, just seeing that makes my mouth water and my panties drop? HUH? And honestly men: LISTEN TO ME! Usually your best piece isn´t even all that and believe me, most times pretty embarrassing. Ugh, pack that away, I gave up smoking .(Yeah, lame joke, I know..esp. as I never gave up smoking but that doesn´t mean I have an oral fixation of some sort)   And to them women: Damm, your triple D tits hanging down to your navel aren´t all that as well. ts ts ts..I don´t consider myself prudish,hell, nudity on the beach is the most natural thing on earth, but all this sex stuff is really getting on my nerves. Really, there are other things out there.

      I can´t only be nagging, nagging, right?  I talked to my girl Julia yesterday night and that was a plus and then I found a big blue envelope in my mail from NYC. Another Janis Joplin CD from Dorene  (happy,happy,joy,joy)  with letters and poems. I haven´t listened to it yet but right now, I can´t be going wrong with Janis. Dee thinks I look like her on the pictures on the inlet but I doubt it! Guess I´ll try and give Dorene a call later on to say "Thank you!" Oh yeah, I also made an appointment at the hairdresser next Thursday  (hooray, another 100 bucks)  and talked to a translator.  (my life is so exciting, right?)

      Oh, how true is that proverb that you luckily can choose your friends but unfortunately not your relatives. All in all, I think I can say I was still pretty lucky with my family as it could have been far worse but nevertheless I`d still think we´re one of those malfunctioning ones. (are there absolutely "right-functioning" ones anyway?)  Anyway, I came back from work just about an hour ago and my aunt that´s living in NYC was here chit-chatting away with my granny.  (another kinda long-winded story as my granny is my mum´s mum and my aunt is my father´s sister and my parents are not even talking to each other and my granny lives with my father and us. Capice?)  Well, as soon as I walked through the door she got up saying that she needs to get home and get her things packed because she´s flying back to NY tomorrow. I don´t really know what I did to her but I can imagine. I used to be her favourite niece, I was the first one to go and visit her in NYC and she paid for summer courses at Pace University when I was 17  (and yes, I DO appreciate that)  but unfortunately I didn´t quite turn out the way she had planned it, I guess. I´m a little messed up  (who isn´t though?)  and I made some not so wise choices and had some bad luck sometimes but I never ever asked anyone for help or got into real deep trouble. I did pretty good considering some circumstances I´d say. I did my school and got a job and now I´m planning on going to college now. There are  people out there that made far worse choices than I did, I´d suppose. Anyway, it sucks I didn´t turn out a doctor, right auntie??

      I´m alone in the office for the next 5 weeks. It´s so relaxing!!! Not even the weather can destroy my mood today. I haven´t done shyt today and I don´t even have a bad conscience. I´m allowed to have a lazy day or two once in a while.&nbsp;I&nbsp; was almost&nbsp;late this morning as well as I seem to&nbsp;have missed out on a lot of sleep. I think I was dead the last two nights.  I went over to Mr. Music´s place on saturday afternoon although I didn´t really feel like it but I felt obliged to do so and so I took the train down there. He met me at the train station and we headed over to McDonalds, a place I only visit once in a blue moon, but I didn´t feel like going to a restaurant or wait forever for my food so we were left with McDonalds. I don´t really understand how he can eat there as he is a vegetarian but I´m thinking too much anyway. He didn´t eat anything "meaty" but still McDonalds and vegetarians don´t go together for me. We then climbed up that mountain to his house and chilled. He tried to teach me how to roll a Spliff right but I have two left hands and I came to the conclusion I´ll never ever be able to get it right. I hadn´t smoked in over a year and so you can imagine my reaction. I was stoned almost immediatly. I don´t think I´m a good smoker to be with as I usually just get extremly slow. My whole body is too heavy to move and holding a conversation doesn´t work because I answer in my head but not out loud. I went to bed early. Mr. Music told me he had a bad night sleeping next to me because I wouldn´t even let him touch me. I must have pushed him away quiet violently. As for me, I slept like I was dead. I can´t remember the last time I was so deep asleep. The whole next&nbsp;day&nbsp; was spent in bed, sleeping, no sex wanted from my side, none at all.&nbsp; Maybe Mr. Music was a little dissappointed but only the idea of anyone touching me made me sick.&nbsp; I couldn´t stand it. I left at 6 pm and headed home. Have to get ready and in the mood for the festival. 3 more days.

      Okay, just dropping in to make a quick post before the ULLE ( ULLE ULLE ULLE ALLEZ ALLEZ ) and Klöden ( ALLLEEEEEEZZZ ) start.   It`s official now, I went back to blonde this morning. I haven´t figured my opinion out on it yet but hey, it´s just hair, right?  Met Mr. Music yesterday and I got a place to go on New Years already as he presented a flight ticket. Well, I was all excited and still am. But there´s something still bothering me. He´s doing so damm much for me and I haven´t asked nor expected anything. I´m not used to it and it gives me this weird feeling of maybe adapting to it one day and then being dependent on him. I hate that.&nbsp; Esp. the house in NYC for my studying time bothers me. It takes a lot of pressure away from me but it also gives me the feeling of "owing" him. I don´t like that, not at all.  (yeah, I´m a weird person, esp. as he never implemented anything like that.)     &nbsp; Oh yeah, the sun is out and it´s hot. WHOOHOOO!!!!  4 more days untill my vacation and the festival....

      Shame on me again for not posting for almost a week but it seems noone is reading my blog anyway these days anymore  (*sigh* Yeah, Tionne, I am so dissappointed!)!  I can't blame anyone though as my life is not really one of those exciting ones and nothing much has happened since I last posted. Work´s still crazy because my boss decided to be a dick before he leaves next week and I have to get everything done before that but I´m not too stressed out as he´ll be away for 5 whole weeks and that is definitely helping my mood. Also, that festival is coming up next week and I´m gettting all excited about that. I´m going to enjoy every minute of it and if they really got the bungee jumping station there I´ll be doing that! YES!!! The jump itself doesn't really interest me but I´m too curious about my reaction standing up there and will I overcome my fear? Will I be able to actually let go and fall depending on total strangers and their rope? I mean, I'm having trouble with letting go when it comes to my relationships, with trusting, with people I have sex with so how will it feel to have to trust strangers when it comes to jumping down a crane? I will be an experience, I suppose.   &nbsp;

      I am ready for some more time off.   First thing Monday morning coming into the office that almost made me turn around and leave was the huge pile on my desk. I mean, I was only away for 5 days. How can THAT happen? Anyway, got me my coffee, turned on my PC and the next shock: my e-mail account flooded! Great. It took me 4 whole days to work through all that stuff and apart from that my boss was getting on my nerves extremely. I AM ALWAYS RESPONSIBLE-EVEN IF THAT SHYT WAS DONE 5 YEARS BEFORE I STARTED! The nicely put remarks of my colleagues about the bags under my eyes didn´t help my mood either. "Oh yeah! Thank you for reminding me constantly that I look like shyt!"  (By the way, any ideas about how to get rid of the dark circles under my eyes? Anyone?)   The atmosphere at home wasn´t much better. Everyone got on my nerves and I just couldn´t help being bitchy. JUST LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE FOR GOD'S SAKE!!! Well, it got to the point to where I got out my old bike, cleaned it, pumped it and went on a bike trip at 9:30 pm on Tuesday night. And hell, that did me good. I wanted to do that every night to get that tension out but the weather is still messed up. There is NO SUMMER in Germany. None!!! So now it´s another weekend and I´ll end up in my bed alone.....miserable and full of self-pity. Oh yeah, don't I just love to bath in that?! lmao* Nah, I´ll be alright! I´m in this for one reason and that is my dream of New York City and it will all be worth it! REALLY!  (convince me please!)

      The Cap Anamur story made a turn that I didn´t expect and that got me thinking about whether to trust any charity or international help organizations at all. The Africans they supposingly saved out on the open sea are not from Sudan but from Ghana; Nigeria and Niger so 3 crew members were arrested (the big boss of the organization, the captain and the 1st officer) for trying to bring in illegal immigrants into Europe. Okay it´s up to everyone to decide whether you like the current immigration laws or not and why the asylum seekers are suffering that much in their country to have to leave to "Golden" Europe. It´s a farce to me though that after they were rescued the ship didn´t bring them into the nearest harbor but was waiting for the big boss, Elias Bierdel, of the organization to join them on board for at least a week. He surprisingly was escorted by 3 camera teams. Publicity reasons?!? After all, it´s their 25th Birthday this year. So that´s a really hazy thing to me. Of course, they are doing good and whether the Africans are really from Sudan or not they were on the open sea in a nutshell trying to get to Europe so they had to be rescued but why the hell didn´t they bring them to the next safe harbor, Lambedour,to get them medical aid and actually got them on solid ground? Instead they were cruising in front of the Italian coast for three whole weeks. It´s all a mystery to me! And it´s definitely not doing any good to the reputation of the organization. Publicity is good and needed for such organizations but it should never come before their actual duty-TO HELP IMMEDIATLY!

      I´m only slowly waking up and I´m sitting here in my Pyjamas-STILL! And it´s 1 pm! Not that I care too much, after all it´s Sunday and also my last vacation day. Yes, I have to get back to work tomorrow and that is already giving me the creeps but I´ll push on through like always, counting the days untill my boss is going on his vacation for 5 whole weeks and my 4 days off at the end of this month.  (There´s definitely one thing that I WILL miss about Germany when in NYC and that is the vacation time they give you. Of course, there will be other things and not to forget persons I`ll miss)  Anyway, it was a strange night and I was woken up by a little child crying, or so I thought at first. Actually I thought, still half-asleep, that my grandmother had visitors with a little child upstairs untill I realized that they all sounded like my brothers and their friends. But where does the baby fit in there? And why would they all be in my grandmother`s apartment? I managed to open my eyes after a while and it was only starting to get light outside and the clock said 5:30 am. Well, that was definitely more than strange. I didn´t make it out of bed but I was listening attentively, getting ready to jump out and fight- just in case. Okay, it wasn´t a baby crying it was a girl, a young woman..hmmm....the way she cried made it all even worse. Totally uncontrollable, sobbing, sounding out of her mind. Okay, I wanted to check now, but the doorbell rang and it was an ambulance with doctors. All kind of crazy thoughts went through my mind. A girl that was raped, an accident and stuff like that. But why would they not call the cops then? Anyway, i heard the doctor talking to that girl about giving an injection and then getting a little louder to calm her or something. After a while everyone left. I fell asleep again  (yeah, it sounds like I`m an un-emotional bitch, but what was there to do? I kinda didn´t get it straight anyway, I guess)     Well, I got up at 11:30 am and went down into the kitchen and there was my granny asking me how my night was and I told her, that there was something strange going on, but I wasn´t sure what it was. Well, she told me the story. I was my youngest brother´s girlfriend. She had something like a seizure or a nervous-breakdown. My grandmother had gotten up and had found her lying on the floor in my other brother´s room, crying, totally out of her mind, my youngest brother sitting on her arms, trying to calm her down and not letting her do anything stupid. They had called the ambulance and they had taken her to the Psychriatic Hospital. My brother went with them. It must have happened before but she had been alright the last couple of months she was with my brother. They let her go about 2 hours ago and now she´s downstairs with my brother, sleeping. And my grandmother said something unincredible heartless to me: " He better concentrate on his studies. That´s more important than anything else now!" WHAAATT??  (Not to mention her remark about young people nowadays not really being strong anymore) It´s not her fault and she´s a nice girl as far as I am concerned and you don´t choose things like that. I´m proud of my brother, he´s a good guy. He´s taking care and is not acting like an azz. I wish the guys that I was with before had been at least half-considerate as he is now.

      because I wrote what I wrote two posts down about Mr. Music and reading it again with AnaThema´s comment made me realize that there might be some truth to it. At least truth to the way it sounds. Mr. Music is a good guy, really, and I´m not seeing him as a tool because he did way too much for me already and now it even hit me harder. He called today and he has talked to his parents that have just moved to Florida leaving their house in NYC behind to rent out. Well, to make it short: He convinced his parents to leave the first floor to me -for free or at least very cheap- so that I can totally concentrate on my studies. Damm, I feel like a real bitch now. Someone slap me please! I deserve it! It´s just really hard for me to trust men in general for my experiences were pretty bad but I need to let go of that because some out there are really nice and to  count on. Eventhough he doesn´t read this: I apologize....

      "Appeal to the Eurpean Civil Community  Elias Bierdel, Head of Cap Anamur (07/04/2004)  "Since early Thursday we have been drifting 15 miles off Empedocle. We are insisting on entering the port as was planned and originally permitted! Still the authorities have given us no explanation as to why the permit to enter Italian waters that had previously been granted was suddenly withdrawn. ...... The shipwrecked people we have on board are not "clandestini", as they haven't yet crossed the borders of the European Union. As requested, and in accordace with international rights laws and common sea-faring practice, we gave a list of all the people on board. One cannot call this an attempt at "illegal migration". ..... We will not accept being diverted to another port. We have 37 shipwrecked people on board and are therefore not in a position to play games with the authorites.   We think that a solution must be worked out in accordance with International Human Rights laws and based on humanitarian principles. The question of how to deal with a situation like this must be solved on the political level of the European Union: It is this policy of the EU, executed forcibly by the Italian coast guard, navy and guardia difinanza, which prevents our rescue ship from aiding people in need."   It's a farce. I´m losing my respect for our politicians more and more. These are people that fled from a war and you don´t want to let them into your country? You all need to get your head checked.

      I've got a headache for a couple of days now and it´s just not getting better or worse. It's not really that bad, just this constant toc toc toc behind my right, and sometimes left, forehead. Maybe I´ve been reading too much lately. I think, I read and finished at least 10 books within the last 2 - 2 1/2 months. They were not all good but once I start reading something I just need to know how it ends and I usually just push on through. 2,3 were quite good though and in that case it´s not really an option for me to put that thing down before I`m through with it. So basically my spare time consisted of reading the last couple of weeks and maybe my head just wants a break. Well, I´ll listen to it for the time being.  (Of course, I should get my eyes checked as well but I just don´t feel like going to the eye specialist in the nearer future)   Mr. Music asked me to come over tomorrow but I haven´t really made up my mind. He´s been getting on my nerves lately. But the idea of getting away from my family for a few days is definitely something very tempting. Some peace and quiet and on top of that getting laid. Yeah, I might really catch a train down there. And if he gets on my nerves too much, I´ll go out shopping (I still got part of that reward to spend) . I´ve started to really mistrust him and question everything he tells me. I´m not jealous and if he' s seeing other girls that´s perfectly alright with me but he's been giving me all this talk about who he's hanging out with and that he's in the studio with so and so but he can't get me that one ticket to that festival??? It's not even that  (I rather pay for my shit myself anyway) , after all I know he got some connections but all this talk about the music business and shyt doesn´t impress me at all. I´m not interested in it and I don't need or want to hang out with all these people. It's really nothing that I want in my life and if I get the idea that someone is seeking to impress me with that it's a real big turn-off. You just can't get me with bling bling or your famous friends. Impress me with something else please.  (apart from that the sex isn't even all that. I mean it's just plain rough f*cking and that never really gave me much but it's better than nothing.)  And with the risk of getting slapped by my girl, I still miss Michael. I just miss him...STILL!

      This is love calling earth Do you know how much it hurts? I didn't die overnight In the wind I had candlelight I'm controlled by my fear All the voices in my head That I can hear  Please don't hurt me  How do I learn To give love and be loved in return If this is heaven I'm falling I'd rather jump and run away Than see it burn I feel I could die Before I sleep I kiss your cheek And say goodbye  I'm so sorry Please don't hurt me  This is love calling earth Do you know how much it hurts? I didn't die overnight In the wind I had candlelight  I'm controlled by my fear And all the voices in my head That I can hear  I'm so sorry Please don't hurt me  If you could see me through my mother's eye Only then would you begin to realise All the places I have ever been Have scared me half to death or somewhere in-between  I'm so sorry Please...

      I went over to Julia´s place yesterday night to watch the European Soccer Finals. It was Greece-Portugal and I actually thought I wouldn´t care too much about who wins but I was wrong I DID. Greece won which is not a bad thing in itself and it def. was the movie-like story of an underdog doing it all BUT I favored Portugal. So I was sad when they lost...ruined my whole night. It was fun anyway and this morning I spend 2/3 of my reward in a store before getting on the train back home. And by the way, should you ever come to Germany and consider taking a train, get used to delay. The train ride itself was okay although teenage girls with their disc-men on so loud that you can still hear it in the next department suck esp. when you sit next to them. Also, people should be more considerate about garlic. Would be much appreciated! Thank you!  It´s still raining and I´m out to help with some English in a few minutes and after that I´ll be completly lazy doing nothing. After all, it´s my vacation.

      I survived the Sales Meeting and it went quiet alright and I didn´t feel too much outta place.  (hell, I hope that doesn´t mean I´m adapting *shivers*)  It was weird anyway. First of all, I don't feel too comfortable in big expensive hotels and of course, I embarrassed myself within the first 5 minutes. I quickly checked in, in a rush, because my car was outside blocking some parked cars.  (yeah, i JUST DON`T GIVE A SHIT..I didn´t know where to park. I had to ask the receptionist)  So after parking my car in the garage I get into the elevator in the lobby and press 4....NOTHING! I keep on pressing and waiting for about 2,3 minutes untill I finally realize that I need my room card: You know slide it through that thing and actually get permission to use that damm elevator. Anyway, of course the elevators were glass so the whole damm lobby was watching me. Yeah, Miss Confused has just entered the building. So I get to my room and make myself comfortable for about an hour and then got ready for the big dinner thing. Fortunatly, one of the team assistants called me and we went down together. Yeah, I´m kinda shy sometimes. So it was all blah blah, speeches and shit and then big boss announced the most successful branch in Germany: US! Okay, on stage to get the reward. I hate that...I was wearing that white suit and I just hoped I hadn´t spilled anything on it and standing up there in that light I suddenly hoped that that thing wasn´t see-through. I have no clue,  but I got some compliments that night anyway-because it revealed too much or maybe because it didn´t, doesn´t matter anyway. Well, after that was dinner and then the DJ started playing. I left at 12:30 am and I think that was a reasonable time. But after spending 2 hours with women that were all at least 20 years older than me, talking about their kids and shit and then complimenting me on my figure, I was worn out. I mean, what do you want me to say? "Hey, you are actually 20-30 years older than me and have 3 kids..of course I might be a little better in shape. You don´t have to compliment myself on that. REALLY! Wait till I get there, fuckin way of nature..." The seminar this morning was dull and once I got back home I just chilled out. Lazy, rainy, cold Saturday afternoon and night.

      I think. Maybe I´m a manic-depressive?  (or just a hypochondriac?)  I got lots of stuff done today and I´m content with myself. I got a lot of work done, also due to the fact that they cut the internet connection at all branches in Germany for some updating and I didn´t even have the opportunity to waste time online. There was nobody there at the office today as well and I got to do a lot of long overdue filing that I was always too ashamed to do when my co-workers were there. "Emmm..yeah, it´s been there for a couple of weeks." So my desk will be cleaned up for my vacation that´s next week. I hate nothing more than wondering about whether I forgot something to do at work or whether my boss finds out about a possible mistake I made on my days off. So I´m using these last two days to get that out of the way. I also made it to the bank later and i WALKED there  *drums and trumpets please*  and left the car in the garage. It´s just a 15 minutes walk but honestly when there´s a car around people tend to get lazy and even drive 2 min to the next MacDonalds. (C´mon be honest with yourself)  So I made up my mind and I will walk to all possible destinations in reach from now on. So I took the umbrella, put on my yellow sneakers and walked. YES!!! I got my rent paid and the tickets to go to the festival end of this month and I also took a not so small amount and put it right away into my savings account. Then I went to the post office and collected the book and cd I ordered at amazon and now I´m back home thinking about a possible jogging trip I could do tonight. Should I, shouldn´t i? Wouldn´t do no harm, but it´s raining...hmm...I tell ya my decision later. lol* Tomorrow´s the big Sales Meeting and I deteste that. I don´t like company get-togethers. Well, I´ll make it through somehow. At least the hotel seems like a damm good place to stay and it´s a free 5 star dinner.  oh yeah, my girl TIONNE: I know what you are saying.Actually that´s what I meant with van Gogh and Kandinsky. Kandinsky might look messed up at first but when you dig a little deeper you get the "whole picture". Anyway, I´m pmsing as well....so you know what´s up...;)I get all mushy and sentimental. Of course our summers were best summers as well but just on a different level. My brain agrees with everything you say about him but my heart doesn´t. (okay, I´m getting pathetic! Off to get some cigs!)

      I made up my mind and told Mr. Music yesterday that I´m coming with him to NYC in October. The timing is just perfect and I can apply for college while being over there personally which will be a lot easier I'd say. 8 more weeks and I'm back where I'm always happy.

      Blogging at work has become my regular thing to do, I guess. Doesn't matter though, it's just been slow here. I have no idea what will happen though if they catch me, but that doesn't matter as well! I've been surfing through some blogs and I have to say I don't like British bloggers but then I might just have come across the wrong ones. No disrespect intended. REALLY! Also, I realized my blog layout sucks. I've seen all kinds of hit counters, little graphics, cute little backgrounds and totally impressive blogs today. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT!! I'm just too bloody  (to keep it British)  lazy to get all that stuff done, read through all that html things and learn how to get it done. So ya'll have to live with the boring azz layout! A hit counter wouldn't make it on here anyway as I don't want to be reminded that noone really gives a fuck about this thing.Yes, I like to lie to myself. It's only Wednesday and I have to get up at 7 am for another two days and I haven't heard from Mr. Music for a couple of days and I kinda miss him. Actually I just get vex when I feel like talking to someone and that person is not there. Highly disturbing to me. How can that be?: IT`S ME!! TALK TO ME!!! YOU ALL SHOULD BE TOTALLY HAPPY I'M CALLING YOU!!! Yep, self-centered bitch me! I never hold a grudge though. ´ Since that festival I've been on that Reggae-Dancehall trip again. So currently playing at work is: Warrior King- Rough Road. Unfortunately my PC doesn't have speakers so I got my headphones plugged in! If I could I'd dance around the office but the headphones spoil it all! LIFE SUCKS!!!!

      I´ve been reading through all of my posts lately and it did shock me a little. Just the way I´m thinking right now. I used to fall in love really quickly and deep but that has changed within the last couple of months. No, it probably was a more subtle change that I´ve been undergoing for much longer. My last experience with that man -THE MAN- really brought the total change.  For the first time in my life I had thought that´s it. He´ll be there, he´ll understand but then I was probably just projecting all my hopes and dreams unto him. I should have known while he was here and I did, subconsciously, and that´s why I already pushed him away. I knew when I brought him to the airport, that last hug, that helpless last kiss. I wished he would understand and he maybe he did. Looking back at that time after he made that phone-call, at last, after three whole weeks of the words lingering:  "That long-distance thing ain't working. Maybe we should just be friends", I think I really could have ended it all. It was just the last trigger. It was not all about him, but so much well buried baggage coming back to the surface brought out into the light by him. It was because of him that I cut my hair, that I died it black, that I started a therapy. At first, to get him back, then for me. That´s when the real change in thinking set in. I am still not ready for something close again. I can´t just bear the thought of opening up to someone, of letting myself be vulnerable again. I can't be looking for love if I don't love myself, if I don't know what love is really. I have to find my own happiness and there's a long way ahead of me.   (yep, a miserable sounding entry but I need to let it out somewhere and I found this blog helps me somehow.)

      Julia thinks I´m an "intellectual" because I thought of Sartre when that bathtub fucker introduced himself. It was the damm name....we bursted out laughing. YEEEAHHH RIIIIGHHHTT!!!  (I was wrong anyway...it was "de Sade")    Simone de Beauvoir: "Pleasant sensations are too mild; it is when the flesh is torn and bleeding that it is revealed most dramatically as flesh."

      guess what! I'm in the office. Totally bored, tired: I wanna go home and sleep. I can't sleep at night in my room - under the roof: It´s too fucking hot.   Had to go by bike this morning. My brother needs the car. Just my luck! It´s supposed to be the hottest day of the year so far and that_girl sweating, coughing her lunges out on a bike! I´m a looser baby!  Mr. Music invited me to go to NYC with him in October, thinking about it, want to say Yes but not sure yet.   Scared of loosing independance. I´m a loner, I think. That guy that fucked me, I fucked him, we fucked each other in the bathtub brought that to the surface. I don't like to go hand in hand, I don't want anyone breathing down my neck the whole fucking day. I don't need to be held at night. Get off me! Guy didn´t do that: that's why we fucked. End of story!

      It´s too hot to do anything. I´ve been spending most of my weekend down in the basement or on the lawn in our garden. I´m sweating, I´m tired but I still love summer although it makes me extremely slow. I considered going swimming but then all those city kids will be at the lake and it would be all noisy and dirty. I want peace this weekend.  I got a little upset yesterday because there´s rumors that a used-to be friend got married and didn´t tell anyone which is not a bad thing in itself but knowing her she did it that way to safe money. That girl is so extremely avaricious it makes me sick. Anyway, I don't really have friends in this town anymore because I just can't deal with close-minded and ignorant people. I used to hang out with a bunch of girls I got to know in highschool but when I got into trouble none of them was there. One of them, working at the local bank, had the nerve to say she was embarrassed of me because I was in debt when I lost my job. Remarks like "You should stop hanging out with those ghetto boys!" was the last thing to leave them behind. Of course, black guys I date are all ghetto....  *rolls eyes*  Anyway, it gets lonely but I got a few friends I can count on eventhough they live far, I know they got my back. damm, now I´m getting into a real mushy mood. I love you!  And to the rest of them: Live your little picked-fenced boring lifes and kiss my azz because I´ll be at the top one day!

      Alright, I´m back, back at work but still alone in the office without my boss so let´s see whether I can still remember everything that happened on that last weekend. It was kinda crazy but I think I behaved alright. Could have been much worse. Thursday morning: Got on the first train at 10:58 with my backpack and my big red bag. I wasn´t too excited but def. looking forward to seeing my girl Cindy and her little one. As for the festival I didn´t expect too much although the line-up had me smiling. All in all the train ride was pretty smooth until I got closer to the venue and stupid teenagers, also on their way there, took over the train with their ghettoblasters blasting the stupiest German Rap there is. The Ganja smoke in my department calmed me down though otherwise I would have gone bezerk listening to I-wannabe-tough-and-so-ghetto-although-i`m-a-white-german-middle-class-kid kinda songs that consisted of pussy, cunt, bitch, azzfuck and nothing else. Just my type!! Well, I made it there after 8 hours and  Cindy and lil'  Casey met me at the track. I was surprised because that kid liked me at once and I couldn´t get her off my arm for the days to come. Me and kids is really strange. I don´t have a particular liking for them (Casey was a cutie though) and I´m not getting all mushy over them but they seem to really have a thing for me. Well, I`M STILL NOT READY FOR ONE-TOO BAD! Anyway, we walked home as Cindy fortunately lives right around the corner-Can you say downtown Chemnitz?-and chilled that night.  Friday: The fun begins. I was woken up by a scream and later a foot in my face.  (Really, I don´t want kids!)  It took me a while to figure out where I was because at first I was sure that I was in Australia. Don't ask! I don´t know myself.  We woke ourselves up with some coffee and I went into town as I had tried on my new bikini the night before and I wasn´t comfortable. I needed some push-up cushions. Yeah, yeah, I really wish I had more up there.It´s out! Anyway, I  found some silicone pads and I told myself "Fuck it! Let me try those expensive as they are!" Well, they had the wished effect and I bought them although I didn´t wear my bikini the whole weekend but hey, there might be a time and place for it, right? Apart from that they really feel kinda sexy but look ridiculous. I also got me some new sunglasses because you can never have enough of those as well. Back at my girl´s place we got ourselves ready and after her Mum had picked up the baby we were on our way. We decided on taking the bus-shuttle which ran quite frequently up to the festival area and made our way to the station. I got me some fags at the store and we got the bus tickets which were 5 bucks each but at least you could use that shuttle as many times as you wanted to. We didn´t know then that we wouldn´t really need it more than twice. But hey, we can´t look into the future and better be safe than sorry, right? Well, after waiting in that damm bus for at least 20 minutes without air-condition, which by the way made me feel really smart for not putting on any make up seeing the smeared chicks in there with us, it took us all the way to the festival area. We got our red wrist bands and headed to the Riddim stage. I didn´t feel like dealing with a German HipHop crowd at all and fortunately Cindy was with me. Well, first stop was the cocktail booth and I had me a PinaColada. The guy liked me, I suppose, as that stuff was strong. Well, needless to say that I was to come back frequently the next 3 days.Cindy doesn´t drink as to some bad experiences but hell, I needed and wanted to get wasted. I was on vacation, right? The Riddim stage was relaxed and not too crowded and Ce'cile was just performing and it was tight.  In between acts we chilled on the meadow next to the stage and I visited my booth to taste the CubaLibra and some other cocktails which I can´t recall anymore.  Baby Cham´s performance was really good as well and somehow we were front row all of a sudden but that is up to my concert skills. You just gotta know where to come from, right? Cindy was feeling it and I guess I turned her on to Dancehall and Reggae.  (Cheer for me!! or the artists..but I brought her there..I kept insisting...)   The main act that night was Luciano and I enjoyed that as well. I can't recall when last I danced that much. Fortunately the security had a hose so we got wet a couple of times and again I was glad I turned down make-up. Hell, it´s a fucking festival, right? Well, after Luciano it was already 10 or 11 pm and we decided on checking out the tents. It was just three huge tents: The Juice tent (HipHop), The Riddim tent (Dancehall) and I think some D+B shit but we never made it there. We were all hyped up thinking about shaking our azzes only to find the tents still deserted. Oh yeah, that main act on the HipHop stage was still playing (Raekwon-WUTANG). Well, what better to do than to get a beer?  Hell, is this shyt getting too long or what?
