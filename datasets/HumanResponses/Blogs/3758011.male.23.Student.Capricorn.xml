       Organizational performance depends on various internal factors like technology, employee performance, workplace environment, etc; external factors like competition, timely receipt and delivery of materials, regulations and other environmental factors. However, the behaviour and quality of employees within the organization have a fundamentally important effect on organizational performance. Much of the managerial discourse asserts that organizational goals are largely achieved through the effort of the employees and if their performance is improved, the organization in turn will be more productive. Constant development of knowledge, skills and behaviour of the employees help the organization grow.  Performance management can thus be defined as the policies, procedures and practices that focus on employee performance as a means of fulfilling organizational goals and objectives. It also acts as a motivating factor to the employees.  Although performance management is a necessary organizational function, it often proves to be a problematic process. Managers are typically loath to pass a judgement on employees. Employees, on the other hand, often say that the process of having their performance appraised is a futile exercise. The HR professionals in the organization sometimes look at it like a laborious routine job.  Some theorists have a view that performance management is a merely control measure used by an organization. The process of measuring, monitoring and evaluating performance does show organization control over the employees. But actually, this control-based performance management system serves to undermine rather than contribute to the performance of employees towards organizational success.  It is now seen as a developmental aspect for the organization and a very useful motivational as well as developmental factor for the employees. It is a move from simplistic trait methods of performance management to one that provides a detailed feedback emphasizing future tasks and goal achievement.  The main component of an organization’s performance management system is the performance appraisal. This is a formal procedure that consists of a systematic performance review accompanied by appraisal of an employee. Performance management is a process whereas, performance appraisal can be said to be a system. There are a number of performance management systems like: · Trait method. · Objective based method (MBO). · Competency based method. · 360-degree appraisal.  The most common of these is the MBO and the competency based methods, although a lot of work is being carried out for 360-degree appraisal system. Organizations are finding it difficult to implement 360-degree appraisal system, so a lot of companies are going for a mix a MBO and 360-degree appraisal system.   To achieve performance orientation, Indian organizations need to focus on Performance Management System (PMS) rather than Performance Appraisal System (PAS). While a PMS addresses all the relevant and inter-related issues of individual motivation and processes holistically, PAS is one of the many sub-processes involved in a good PMS. It is necessary to amend western management concepts to suit Indian socio-cultural context while drawing inputs for designing an effective PMS.         urlLink ">Link

       Globalization of Indian economy is compelling organizations to rethink their future strategies. It’s now widely recognized that transformation is a pre-requisite to their survival and growth. Business organizations in India especially public enterprises are experiencing winds of change. For the HR function, there could not be a more existing and challenging opportunity than managing the complexities of change and transformation. HR today is playing a lead role along with business functions in creating the necessary momentum and internal capabilities. 	This project seeks to capture the value of “Synergizing HRD Interventions for Growth” covering the ideas and experiences like Changing Business Scenario and HRD Challenges, Organizational Transformation  and Restructuring, Managing Performance and Productivity Enhancement, Managing Diversity, Developing Learning and Training Capabilities and Aligning HRD to Business. 	 HRD Interventions in Developing Global Competitiveness 	Today all are aware that it is the era of globalization and competitiveness. Right now the issue is not only of global competitiveness but local competitiveness. Till now, Indian industries have been so protected that it is not concerned about the emerging competition. These organizations today need to ask themselves where they are and where they need to go. Today’s passwords should be competition for both survival and growth. To meet the new challenges, however, some of the organizations are planning well. As far as organizational planning is concerned Indian organizations are capable of planning well but regarding training and HRD interventions they are not performing too well and don’t even give much importance to it. 	Normally everyone in the organization undergoes training. But to meet the emerging challenges and issues, organizations need to upgrade or modify their HRD interventions, or more specifically training interventions. NTPC is one of the few PSUs where attempts are being made to plan training interventions and a serious thought has been given it to make training a systematic method.  Benchmarking HRD Practices 	Benchmarking is a method of establishing goals based on industry’s best practices. It’s appositive and proactive process change practices and procedures in a structured fashion to achieve superior performance. Today when there is competition not only within India but the world over, and when one can get all information about product, processes and all management styles in minimum time, there is a need to have better or even international benchmarks. Benchmarking HRD practices may help organizations to develop action plans better manpower planning and developing human resources in amore effective manner to meet the challenges of the new millennium.  	In order to make the kind of progress that is need to be competitive, HRD and quality professionals have to work in consonance with each other. It is one of the problems faced by many organizations. Why are things the way they are and what could be done to achieve a positive change? 	The 2 approaches to this problem have been followed since the early part of the century. One is the Human Resource approach, which promotes the ideas of freedom to act and freedom for creativity. The other is the Tailor’s approach in terms of scientific management and in terms of standardization of method. In the early 20th century, mass manufacturing came into being. When a large number of people made the same kind of product of service, then a degree of standardization was necessary to obtain. A degree of consistency was needed to provide to the customers. This led to a situation where standardization became everything.  	Human Resource approach talked about creativity. The conviction was that standardization kills creativity. If one prevents a person from thinking of a better way, and he is asked to do what he is supposed is inhuman. Unfortunately for several years these were considered to be mutually exclusively perspectives. Each one promoted and propagated their respective points of view and there were no meeting points. 	In the early 60s, the situation started changing. And in 1960-62, professor Ichikawa started the use of Quality Circles. What did he really do? He empowered the work force to develop the standards to develop themselves. Earlier the standards were often developed by industrial engineers sitting in the corporate office, and/or a handful of specialists in a company. But if the people who are in the job, whether they are at the operator/manager lever can be trained and empowered to develop their own standards. Ichikawa’s QC is the collective creativity of a group of people doing diverse things who come together to develop their own methods working which is efficient. This is then standardized so that there is consistency till the end. He, thus, brought creativity and consistency through this approach.  	It is important to train the manpower to use the data that’s generated at the workplace. The basic steps in this exercise would be to understand the data, to use it analytically, and to find a better method. Automation in this perspective means that the worker or the manager should be able to stop his work process if it’s proving to be inactive. A new standard may be created. If more than more 1 person is involved in this creative exercise, then the improvement may be of a higher magnitude than it would have been only one person developing it on his own. Each individual contributes and the group is able to bring their contributions together. 	For effective benchmarking of this kind, the 2 main factors are rich data and facts. Management looks at this data and decides the process as to how to do an analysis. The best known analytical tools are statistical tools. So statistical tools have to be used to involve people to create a better a method than the present one. Without creativity this form of benchmarking is not possible. Peter Drucker only recognized what the Japanese did. Basically it was the idea of Ichikawa who gave HRD this system of benchmarking.  Assessing and Evaluating the Impact of HRD interventions        A learning organization acquires knowledge, creates and transfers new knowledge and learns to perform better. Ultimately and organization has to perform and if the learning of the organization does not get transferred into performance then it is a waste. There are several roles of HRD, but the success of HRD can be judged by the performance of the organization. If it does not perform and if HRD personnel do not contribute to the organization in providing them the right environment and the right people, then the organization’s HRD policy can be considered a failure.

       Stock ownership plans enable employees to acquire company stock often at concessional rate. Companies set limits to the amount of stock that employees can buy, which is usually related to the wage or salary earned by the employees or it may be restricted to above certain wage levels. There may be certain conditions with regard to the resale of the stock also - such as agreeing to sell to the issuing company first until a stated period or until he is no longer with the firm. The cost of shares is usually deducted from the pay at source. Sometimes, the worker's share of profits is utilized to pay for the stock purchases. This method of profit sharing is usually applied only to managerial and executive personnel to avoid dealing with vast numbers. This method of profit sharing comes with its own merits and demerits. They merits are: 	Links compensation package closely to performance. 	Offers a way for an organization to retain the best of the employees. 	Motivates recipients to perform even better. 	Inculcates a sense of ownership and responsibility. 	Establishes importance of team effort among employees. The demerits associated with the scheme are: 	Only profitable companies can use the tool. 	Stock prices do not always reflect fundamentals of an organization. 	Falling share price could mean losses for employees 	The inability to cash in quickly can dampen the interest. 	Lack of transparency can earn accusations of favoritism. Inspite of the above associated demerits, this option is being increasingly used by companies to command loyalty in industries marked with high managerial mobility as the scheme links a manager's reward to his efficiency. Kinds of ownership The option of providing an employee with this benefit is done in two ways: Employee Stock Options A stock option is a right issued by a corporation to an individual or an entity to buy a given amount of shares of company stock at a stated price within a specified period of time. Employee stock options are options issued to employees as a form of incentive compensation. A stock option gives an employee the right to purchase a set amount of shares at a fixed price for some years into the future. Generally speaking, the rules for who gets options and how much they get are much looser than for ESOPs. In the past, companies usually gave stock options only to "key" employees. Nowadays, more and more companies give options to most or all employees. There are two main types of stock options. 1. Incentive stock options (ISOs) They must satisfy the conditions of the Internal Revenue Code for preferential tax treatment. An ISO generally allows the employee to defer taxation until the date the shares bought with the option are sold and to pay tax at the applicable capital gains tax rate rather than the (higher) ordinary income tax rates. The company does not get a tax deduction.  2.  Nonqualified stock options (NSOs) They are options that do not satisfy the Internal Revenue Code's conditions for preferential tax treatment. When the employee "exercises" the option by buying the stock, he or she pays ordinary income tax on the "spread" between the value of the stock and the price paid for it. However, the company receives a tax deduction on the spread. Unlike ISOs, NSOs can be given to non-employees.  3. Phantom stock This is another kind of stock option. This is a bonus that rewards employees based on the increase in value of the company's stock, the dividend performance of the stock, or both.  4. Stock appreciation rights (SARs) They are similar, and in effect consist of phantom stock without phantom dividends. Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), are retirement plans in which a trust funded by the employer owns company stock and employees cash out after they leave. The ESOP is the most tax-advantaged mechanism for companies to share ownership with employees. An ESOP is an employee benefit plan operating through a trust that accepts tax-deductible contributions from the company to accumulate company stock, which is then allocated to accounts for individual participants. The ESOP can acquire both new and existing stock. The trust can borrow money to purchase the stock, with the company repaying the loan by making tax-deductible contributions to the ESOP. ESOPs can be used for a variety of purposes, such as: Broadly most companies follow two models. A. Beneficial ownership Under this scheme, the company allocates a number of shares to an employee at a price, which is the 52-week average of the market price. This generally comes at a 10 to 15 percent discount over the market value. The shares are, however, held by a trust. The employee has rights over the shares only after a lock-in period of one year. After 12 months, most companies allow the employees to either sell 25 percent of their shares and pocket the difference or the employees can buy those shares from the trust at the price quoted when the shares were first allocated. Or else the trust continues. Such schemes generally extend over a period of five years. Each year, a certain percentage of shares is freed up for employees to exercise their options which are three: sell, buy or instruct the trust to hold them. At the end of the five-year term, the employee will have to either offload all the shares or buy them from the company at the original price. If the employee resigns before the one-year lock-in period, the employee forfeits all the shares. If he resigns after one year, he can exercise his option of selling or buying 25 percent of the shares. Similarly, after two years there are other alternatives and so on and so forth. Most companies do not allow the employees who have left them to hold such shares beyond five years. They have to sell them back to the trust at a price that is an average of the eight preceding weeks. 5. Shadow ownership This second scheme is offered by multinationals in India. Under this scheme, staffs are allocated shares of the parent company which may be listed abroad-- usually Wall Street or the London Stock Exchange. But here, the stocks are never transferred in your name because Indians are not allowed to hold foreign stocks in their name.
