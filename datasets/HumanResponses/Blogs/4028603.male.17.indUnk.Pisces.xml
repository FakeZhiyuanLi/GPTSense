       Thats absolutely right!!!...India won...and were in the finals....WOHOOOO!!!....the match was simply brilliant...both the teams had its ups and downs...it was a nail-biting finish...and India relieved everyone off the massive amount of tension that had been building up in the atmosphere...    &nbsp;  I think both the teams played a fabulous innings...and id give the credit to India not because they won...but because they finally, after these many matches, played as a team....tendulkar might not have lasted long...but his 4s were just splendid...sehwag, ganguly and yuvraj played an explosive innings....if i had to criticise abt the&nbsp;batting, it wud be dravids and kaifs poor form...and as for balling pathan was pretty good...and zaheer as usual messed it up quite a lot....i mean come on...he gave 40 runs in 3 overs...tht sucked...sehwag did miracles with the ball just like he did with the bat...as for the srilankan id like to thank them for the injuries of vaas murali and zoysa...and wud love to compliment on the tremendous knock of 130 runs by jayasuriya...    &nbsp;  All in all I was just happy the match ended pretty well for me...and im also happy the paki team is going back home...or like saad puts it "ga ga ga ga ga....on ur face...and more ga ga ga"...newayz...yesterday was just brilliant for me....im really glad tht we won the match and were into the finals...and hopefully the finals wud be as intense...as this match was....newayz i just finished dling Van Helsing...i knw its been sometime since the moveis released...but cudnt find the right file for a few days...newayz.. im off...take care all of you....    &nbsp;  Allah Hafiz...    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

I still have no idea how many people come visit this site....but i thank you all neway....and&nbsp;do post comments so im aware of the ones im thanking...and yes even visit ludahappens.blogspot.com...belongs to our great saad miyan...who seems pretty relaxed at this point in his life....guess no ninjas for now eh saad?:P....newayz im off...take care everybody...  &nbsp;  Allah Hafiz...

       Umm...well it started off on the 7th of this month...me and my sister were watching 40 days and 40 nights (for the sick minds out there...it was a censored version:P)...im sure most of u knw wht the story is abt...and those who dont...go and watch the movie:P...newayz...well there was this vow tht the actor makes in the movie...and as the title suggest hes supposed to live up to the vow for 40 days...and as for the vow...he had to give up wht he loved doing most...in this case...ummm...u knw wht im talking abt....      Newayz it so happens...tht my sis asked me to take a vow...no not the same vow...she challenged i wudnt be able to give up wht i love doing...in my case talking to girls...or have any contact with them at all...for 20 days...which means the vow is to get over by the 27th of this month...ya half the duration...i knw how sweet of her:P...well the problem is i do not mind doing it...infact its the 9th today so well ive lived 2 days without girls already...and i can go upto 20 days...but the girls seem to have a problem...simply because they cant go on for 20 days without me:P...ah who am i kidding...newayz jokes aside...now the problem is girls are messaging me and none are recieving a reply...which makes them think im being ignorant and rude which is not at all true....i just cannot chat!!..urgh nvm...and they all go offline saying tht they wont talk to me nemore...ya rite...now who are they kidding:P...      Oh yea btw i downloaded a few new movies...hindi movies to be precise...so neone need em can contact me...but u might have to wait...i just finished my CD stack...have to go get a new one...had got sony the last time...crap cds...trust me...all of them working at 24x around Â¼th of them had gone to waste...newayz...i gtg now...u all take care...

       Ive just read one chapter from it as yet...and i still strongly believe tht the book has something to offer....in the starting i read these few words...it was pretty nice....it sed.."whether im a good man is for God to judge"...i really liked the way its sed cause we wud say the same but instead we wud say its for other people to judge....newayz...im talking abt Bill Clintons autobipgraphy...'My Life'....it was registered to sell a million copies even before it was published...i think thts really cool...im sure his wifes book will be having a tough competition...well newayz this book has it all...from his mom dads rel....to him becoming president...and then ofcourse abt his affair....i think its brave writing all tht in a book...and to publish it damn....i have a hard time sharing news abt my rel with gals...and he writes a book...damn....      Well its not for those who read slow or are bored of life...cause its 800 pages...so dont bother....well i knw i will...its really nice....had gone to Dars today....wasnt gonna go at first...was gonna go to a doc for an appointment to deal with the corns...well let him just take em off...id rather bear the pain once than everyday:P...but i cudnt fix an appointment...stoopid busy doctor...newayz...well cause i cudnt fix an appointment...i went for Dars...and was then gonna go for arshus bros waleema...if i spelled it right tht is...newayz...work came up...and then i got too lazy :P....      Ive downloaded garv and deewar seen both of them too....both the movies were really nice...im waiting for the torrent of mujhse shaadi karogi to release....downloading julie at the moment:P....okie i knw its not a nice movie....but then again im not tht nice a person either:P....ah newayz i guess im done writing here..if u checks my previous postings....my posts seem to grow in words everyday...dun wanna keep up the trend..:P...newayz...take care u all....      Allah Hafiz...

       Ya aight!!! dun even comment on it...i knw the match was completely sri lankas the moment india started batting...my dad was right....which ever match tendlia played well in this tournament...we lost...now thts lame i knw...but a fact too!!! I really dunno wht others think but the last few overs were kinda fun to watch...zaheer blasted 2 towering sixers off murali....tht was some good stuff...i mean come on at time when they were almost 150 for 7 who wudve imagined tht india wud even cross the 200-mark...      But newayz i loved...nothing abt this match:P...simply because india lost...and also cause there wasnt a single knock tht was worth praising be it sachins or marvans....though atapattu was playing a much better game than tendulkar...im so frustrated i dun even feel like watching the presentation...whts the point neway...newayz im sure pakis are pretty happy today...well cant stop em only warn em tht their tour of australia is in 3 days...so they dont have much time to rejoice....but i am on pakis side on this tour no matter wht...cause ive always hated the australians...y do they have to play so well...theyve got 3 world cups under their belt....their the best team...wht more do they need...wud it harm them if they were to lose one tourney...ah...nevermind...      Well a hell lot was expected from the indians in this match...but they were a big disappointment...newayz screw tht...hahaha....narutos new episode was awesome or 'sukey' like naruto himself wud put it:P...this weeks episode is even better...oh and yea narutos manga had released too...and tht too was a treat...ah well newayz...last few days havent been tht great...and to top it off india lost the asia cup:P...well tht cup was made in india...in jaipur to be precise...and it deserved to come back home:P...ah newayz...i gotta go...take care ya all...      Allah Hafiz...
