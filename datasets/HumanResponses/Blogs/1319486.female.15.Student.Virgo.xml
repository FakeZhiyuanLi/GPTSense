      AHAHAHAHA.....these are random thoughts i stole from some website thingy on someones profile....... I wish outer-space guys would conquer Earth and make people their pets, because I'd like to have one of those little basket-beds with my name on it.  Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window? The guy looks out it, and if he leans too far, he falls out. Wait. I guess that's like a regular window.  Normally I'm not one to believe in little green men from Mars. But one night, as I was driving home from a party, I caught something in my headlights I still can't explain. It had weird, catlike eyes and only stood about a foot tall. It was covered with grayish fur, and walked on all fours, like a cat. It had a tail, which if I had to describe in terms of something here on Earth was, in a way, like a cat's. Also, it was carrying a ray gun in its mouth. It was either a ray gun or a mouse.   What am I afraid of? I'll tell you: a feather. That's right, a feather. How could anyone be afraid of a feather, you say. That's an honest question, and I'll try to give it an honest answer. First of all, did I say it was a poison feather?  If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp, because maybe you'll look like a dummy and people will try to catch you because, hey, free dummy.   I'll never forget the time we were at the beach and we buried Uncle Joe in the sand. Boy, did we get in trouble! In fact, we got arrested. It turns out you can't bury people at the beach. Only at the cemetery.  Fear can sometimes be a useful emotion. For instance, let's say you're an astronaut on the moon and you fear that your partner has been turned into Dracula. The next time he goes out for the moon pieces, wham!, you just slam the door behind him and blast off. He might call you on the radio and say he's not Dracula, but you just say, "Think again, bat man."   If you go parachuting, and your parachute doesn't open, and your friends are all watching you fall, I think a funny gag would be to pretend you were swimming.   In my next life, I hope I come back as a parrot, because I already know quite a few words.   I remember the first time I ever went to the museum and saw the mummy. At first I was afraid of it. So, to get over my fear, I started pointing at the mummy and doing a funny little dance. But then I couldn't stop doing the dance. Something made me dance faster and faster until finally I fell on the floor. Even then I couldn't stop doing the dance. I flailed about helplessly, yelling some weird Egyptian words! Then I think I passed out, from hitting my head on the marble floor. Now, I'm happy to say, I'm no longer afraid of the mummy, mainly because I don't go there anymore.   If you go flying back through time, and you see somebody else flying forward into the future, it's probably best to avoid eye contact.   I'd like to see a movie where a guy is going to die when the sand runs out of an hourglass, but then at the last minute an ant stops the sand from running out. Then the rest of the movie is about the ant.  Love is not something that you can put chains on and throw into a lake. That's called Houdini. Love is liking someone a lot.  If I ever opened a trampoline store, I don't think I'd call it Trampo-Land, because you might think it was a store for tramps, which is not the impression we re trying to convey with our store. On the other hand, we would not prohibit tramps from browsing, or testing the trampolines, unless a tramp's gyrations seemed to be getting out of control.   I wish somebody would invent a fruit that had no seeds, tasted delicious, and wouldn't scream when you ate it.   Whether they ever find life there or not, I think Jupiter should be considered an enemy planet.   I bet what happened was, they discovered fire and invented the wheel on the same day. Then, that night, they burned the wheel.   I don't say that the bird is "good" or the bat is "bad." But I will say this: at least the bird is less nude.  One of the worst things you can do as an actor, I think, is to forget your lines, and then get so flustered you start stabbing the other actors.  If a kid ever asks you how Santa Claus can live forever, I think a good answer is that he drinks blood.   In weightlifting, I don't think sudden, uncontrolled urination should automatically disqualify you.   If you ever teach a yodeling class, probably the hardest thing is to keep the students from just trying to yodel right off. You see, we build to that.   The weirdest thing about going to the store and seeing a jar of pickles with your picture on it is not that your picture is on the jar. It's that the store manager won't give you the pickles for free, and doesn't even think the picture looks like you.   To become a knife thrower in the circus, they probably don't let you start off throwing at a live woman. They start you out with a little girl.   It's true that every time you head a bell, an angel gets his wings. But what they don't tell you is, every time you hear a mousetrap snap, an angel gets set on fire.   In the first castles, I bet a common mistake was putting the torture room next to the master bedroom. Boy, you're just not going to get the good sleep that way.   Instead of half-mast, maybe you could fly a flag at three-quarter-mast for a guy who's in a coma. Then, if he gets worse, the flag gets lower, or if he gets better, it starts to move up, so you can just look at the flag and see how he's doing.  To my way of thinking, there's nothing that can't be cured by a big ol' pot o beans. Except maybe bean fever.

      EVERYTHING I REALLY NEED TO KNOW I LEARNED FROM NOAH'S ARK [Author Anonymous]   1. Plan ahead. It wasn't raining when Noah built the ark.   2. Stay fit. When you're 600 years old, someone might ask you to do something REALLY big.   3. Don't listen to critics -- do what has to be done.   4. Build on the high ground.   5. For safety's sake, travel in pairs.   6. Two heads are better than one.   7. Speed isn't always an advantage. The cheetahs were on board, but so were the snails.   8. If you can't fight or flee -- float!   9. Take care of your animals as if they were the last ones on earth.   10. Don't forget that we're all in the same boat.   11. When the doo-doo gets really deep, don't sit there and complain-- shovel!   12. Stay below deck during the storm.   13. Remember that the ark was built by amateurs and the Titanic was built by professionals.   14. If you have to start over, have a friend by your side.   15. Remember that the woodpeckers INSIDE are often a bigger threat than the storm outside.   16. Don't miss the boat.   17. No matter how bleak it looks, there's always a rainbow on the other side.

      first of all i would like to say hello to my adoring fans......"HELLO!" well, that's settled....today was great, lazy mixed with working and working out....i thoroughly cleaned my fish tank and room and vacuumed(sp) it and now im dead tired, yesterday i bought the fifth harry potter book (the order of the phoenix) and i finished it today around 9:15 pm, it took just over 24 hours to read it...not bad considering it's 870 pages long.....very very good tho, best one yet, although the pattern is always the same, this is my thoery of the pattern of the harry potter books....okay.....here goes....something strange happens over the summer, and he's never in contact with his friends until they suddenly reunite before the end of the summer for some reason or another, harry and his friends always know more than the other kids about something that's hidden and they usually have to fight the bad guys in the end to get it back, harry and his friends also never get it exactly right so they put themselves in danger when they really could've avoided it if they just informed the adults of what they were going to do....but of course they don't because they think they have it all figured out, harry can never do it on his own, dobby or hermione or some unlikely character always gives him help in the end when he least expects it and he ends up fighting a very bad guy, who is one of he-who-must-not-be-named's favorite servants who is doing a good job until they fail or die or something, then harry sees he-who-must-not-be-named and they talk and his scar hurts, then dumbledore or someone sent by him comes and saves harry and one of his friends is injured and harry is knocked unconscious and then he doesnt want to talk to anyone at the end of the year feast and he feels no one understands him at the end of every year, at the end of the year, dumbledore explains everything that harry was too dumb to figure out or ask and then he goes home and looks forward to coming back to hogwarts and hates the dursleys once again...THE END. that is the end of my theory...pretty good, huh? yeah, i thought so...well, im taking a break i'll be back in a sec....

      hey y'all, it's me again(who  else ??) im back with some random deep thoughts(again) and i just thought i would share some, these are all credit to "Jack Handey" whoever that may be...  As I walked through the woods, I looked up and saw a squirrel. I smiled and he smiled. At least I think it was a smile. My teeth were showing and my cheeks were pulled up. That's a smile, isn't it? (The squirrel was definitely smiling.)   Give me the strength to change the things I can, the grace to accept the things I cannot, and a great big bag of money.  For centuries, people thought the moon was made of green cheese. Then the astronauts found that the moon is really a big hard rock. That's what happens to cheese when you leave it out.  Once, I wept for I had no shoes.  Then I came upon a man who had no feet. So I took his shoes.  I mean, it's not like he really needed them, right?  If I could be a bird, I'd be a Flying Purple People Eater because then people would sing about me and I could fly down and eat them because I hate that song.   I think a pillow should be the peace symbol, not the dove. The pillow has more feathers than the dove, and it doesn't have a beak to peck you with.   There should be a detective show called 'Johnny Monkey'. That way every week a criminal could say, "I ain't gonna get caught by no monkey," but then he would, and I don't think I'd ever get tired of that.  Too bad Lassie didn't know how to ice skate, because then if she was in Holland on vacation in winter and someone said "Lassie, go skate for help," she could do it.  Instead of studying for finals, what about just going to the Bahamas and catching some rays? Maybe you'll flunk, but you might have flunked anyway; that's my point.  If you work on a lobster boat, sneaking up behind people and pinching them is probably a joke that gets old real fast.   Love can sweep you off your feet and carry you along in a way you've never known before. But the ride always ends, and you end up feeling lonely and bitter. Wait. It's not love I'm describing. I'm thinking of a monorail.   I hate it when people say somebody has a "speech impediment", even if he does, because it could hurt his feelings. So instead, I call it a "speech improvement", and I go up to the guy and say, "Hey, Bob, I like your speech improvement." I think this makes him feel better.   Instead of mousetraps, what about baby traps? Not to harm the babies, but just to hold them down until they can be removed?  Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful, beautiful flamingo, flying across in front of a beautiful sunset? And he's carrying a beautiful rose in his beak, and also he's carrying a very beautiful painting with his feet. And also, you're drunk.   If they ever come up with a swashbuckling school, I think one of the courses should be laughing, then jumping off something.   When you're riding in a time machine way far into the future, don't stick your elbow out the window, or it'll turn into a fossil.   It takes a big man to cry, but it takes a bigger man to laugh at that man.   One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going to take my little nephew to Disneyland, but instead I drove him to an old burned-out warehouse. "Oh, no," I said. "Disneyland burned down." He cried and cried, but I think that deep down, he thought it was a pretty good joke. I started to drive over to the real Disneyland, but it was getting pretty late.   Why do people in ship mutinies always ask for "better treatment"? I'd ask for a pinball machine, because with all that rocking back and forth you'd probably be able to get a lot of free games.   I bet when the Neanderthal kids would make a snowman, someone would always end up saying, "Don't forget the thick, heavy brows." Then they would all get embarrassed because they remembered they had the big hunky brows too, and they'd get mad and eat the snowman.   Too bad you can't buy a voodoo globe so that you could make the earth spin real fast and freak everybody out.   I hope if dogs ever take over the world, and they chose a king, they don't just go by size, because I bet there are some Chihuahuas with some good ideas.   I guess we were all guilty, in a way. We all shot him, we all skinned him, and we all got a complimentary bumper sticker that said, "I helped skin Bob."   Ambition is like a frog sitting on a Venus Flytrap. The flytrap can bite and bite, but it won't bother the frog because it only has little tiny plant teeth. But some other stuff could happen and it could be like ambition.   To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other.   Probably the earliest flyswatters were nothing more than some sort of striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.   To me, clowns aren't funny. In fact, they're kind of scary. I've wondered where this started and I think it goes back to the time I went to the circus, and a clown killed my dad.   Most people don't realize that large pieces of coral, which have been painted brown and attached to the skull by common wood screws, can make a child look like a deer.   Better not take a dog on the space shuttle, because if he sticks his head out the window when you're coming home his face might burn up.   Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto someone's neck, and the guy screams and tries to get it off, I have to laugh, because what is that thing.   If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you think liked dolphins the most? I'd say Flippy, wouldn't you? You'd be wrong, though. It's Hambone.   As the evening sky faded from a salmon color to a sort of flint gray, I thought back to the salmon I caught that morning, and how gray he was, and how I named him Flint.   When you die, if you get a choice between going to regular heaven or pie heaven, choose pie heaven. It might be a trick, but if it's not, mmmmmmm, boy.   Whether they find a life there or not, I think Jupiter should be called an enemy planet.   If you're robbing a bank and you're pants fall down, I think it's okay to laugh and to let the hostages laugh too, because, come on, life is funny.   I think one way the cops could make extra money would be to hold a used murder weapons sale. Many people could really use a cheap ice pick.   Even though I was their captive, the Indians allowed me quite a bit of freedom. I could walk freely, make my own meals, and even hurl large rocks at their heads. It was only later that I discovered that they were not Indians at all but only dirty-clothes hampers.   If you're in a war, instead of throwing a hand grenade at the enemy, throw one of those small pumpkins. Maybe it'll make everyone think how stupid war is, and while they are thinking, you can throw a real grenade at them.   Too bad when I was a kid there wasn't a guy in our class that everybody called the "Cricket Boy", because I would have liked to stand up in class and tell everybody, "You can make fun of the Cricket Boy if you want to, but to me he's just like everybody else." Then everybody would leave the Cricket Boy alone, and I'd invite him over to spend the night at my house, but after about five minutes of that loud chirping I'd have to kick him out. Maybe later we could get up a petition to get the Cricket Family run out of town. Bye, Cricket Boy.   I remember that one fateful day when Coach took me aside. I knew what was coming. "You don't have to tell me," I said. "I'm off the team, aren't I?" "Well," said Coach, "you never were really ON the team. You made that uniform you're wearing out of rags and towels, and your helmet is a toy space helmet. You show up at practice and then either steal the ball and make us chase you to get it back, or you try to tackle people at inappropriate times." It was all true what he was saying. And yet, I thought something is brewing inside the head of this Coach. He sees something in me, some kind of raw talent that he can mold. But that's when I felt the handcuffs go on.   Once when I was in Hawaii, on the island of Kauai, I met a mysterious old stranger. He said he was about to die and wanted to tell someone about the treasure. I said, "Okay, as long as it's not a long story. Some of us have a plane to catch, you know." He started telling his story, about the treasure and his life and all, and I thought: "This story isn't too long." But then, he kept going, and I started thinking, "Uh-oh, this story is getting long." But then the story was over, and I said to myself: "You know, that story wasn't too long after all." I forget what the story was about, but there was a good movie on the plane. It was a little long, though.   I bet a fun thing would be to go way back in time to where there was going to be an eclipse and tell the cave men, "If I have come to destroy you, may the sun be blotted out from the sky." Just then the eclipse would start, and they'd probably try to kill you or something, but then you could explain about the rotation of the moon and all, and everyone would get a good laugh.   A wise man would pick up a grain of sand and envision the entire universe, a stupid man would role in seaweed, stand up, and say, "Look, I'm vine man."   Instead of crucifying people on crosses, why not on windmills? That way, they get the pain, and the dizziness.   When I found the skull in the woods, the first thing I did was call the police. But then I got curious about it. I picked it up, and started wondering who this person was, and why he had deer horns.   If i was being executed by lethal injection, I'd clean up my cell real neat. Then when they came to get me, I'd say, "Injection? I thought you said inspection." Then maybe they might end up feeling real bad, and maybe i could get out of it.   You know what would be the most terrifying thing that could ever happen to a flea? Getting caught inside a watch somehow. You don't even care, do you.   If your friend is already dead, and being eaten by vultures, I think it's okay to feed some bits of your friend to one of the vultures, to teach him to do some tricks. But ONLY if you're serious about adopting the vulture.   If I were a cat, some day when I fell, I think I'd throw everyone off and land on my head.   Once when I was little, I was carrying a lot of blankets on my back, and I fell. I couldn't stand up because they were to heavy. Then my dog saved me and pulled off all the blankets. I feed her more than the other dog.   When we were little Mr. Peterson would always tell us to watch out where we were going but a year later he got hit by a car, now when I cross the street I always close my eyes and run.   THAT'S IT, that's all i have to put, i have been looking at these for about an hour and some of them are so stupid that i am tiring, or maybe it's because it is 11:06pm and im thinking that i have to wake up at 8 am tomorrow morning in order to be at church at 9 to paint a bunch of stuff for vacation bible school.....whoosh! im off to go read rebecca and go to sleep, by the way, rebecca's a good book(read it!)

      I AM DEPRESSED. MY DOG IS GONE. JACK IS GONE. MY MOM HAD TO PUT HIM TO SLEEP THIS MORNING. I CRIED FOREVER LAST NIGHT AND THIS MORNING WHEN SHE TOLD ME. i got home and i was like "where's jack?" b/c all he ever did this past two weeks was lay in his bed, yesterday he couldn't even walk or get up or eat...my mom had to take him outside to go to the bathroom and it was SO SAD im crying right now....anways, and my mom was like "we put him to sleep this morning." as she was crying and then i almost fell over i couldn't take it...i've had Jack for as long as I can remember....we actually got him from these people who abused him when i was just turning four, they were about to give him back when i was having my four year old birthday party, but they saw how nice he was when he took all the stuff we(twenty-something 4 year olds) could dish at him, we played "wheelbarrow" with him and held his hind legs and he would walk on his front legs, and we'd pull his tail(it doesnt actually hurt them but still...) and we'd pick him up and pull his ears and beat him up slightly and he would be so nice and he would never bite or scratch you, he was very sweet and mellow, my other dog Suzie doesnt notice really that he's gone, she used to bite him and play with him and he would just stand there and take it, he was so nice, i love my puppy, the megans are throwing me a party to cheer me up and that might help, i know he was suffering (he had cancer by the way), it was the worst kind of cancer he could get, it supposedly took over every cell in his body, the last time i saw him was when i packed up my stuff to go to megan peterson's house, i hugged him and gave him lots of kisses so im glad i kind of got to say goodbye, im glad my mom didn't tell me what she was gonna do or else i would've had the worst night last night even though it was pretty bad, i felt really stupid going to megan's house yesterday afternoon on my bicycle, crying....wow, it's 11:11, I'm making a wish that Jack is in heaven with Rosie(Megan P's dog) and that he's happy and chasing squirrels and eating them and tearing them to bits.....well, this entry was dedicated to Jack, my beloved hooch-y dog that i've known and loved since as long as i can remember, i'll miss you so much and i wish you could live forever and stay with me but i know you cant, omg i can't stop crying now, now there's no one to jump on my bed at night and then i can kick you out and be mean to you, and no one to lay around and scratch, and he'll never put his head in my lap like he used to when he wanted someone to pet him, that was the cutest thing, and he'll never "scoot" or run around the house real fast, or chase squirrels and catch them and leave them on the front porch, or kill cockroaches b/c im scared of them or bark late at night or roll around on the carpet all cute and itchy, or run up and down the fence really fast b/c of the neighbor dog, i saw suzi doing that two days ago and i started crying b/c jack hasn't done that in like 3 months, ive been scared of him dying for like a year and when he would sleep i would get really scared and then i'd perk him up by saying "squirrels" or "cookies"(cookies are like dog treats) so i could make myself feel better, but yesterday i kept trying to get him up and he just layed there and looked at me with his big sad eyes breathing really hard.......i can't write anymore, i have to go do something to cheer myself up, in conclusion, i love you so much jack and i'll miss you and remember you forever, you were the best dog ever......

      hey again, im back(wow i wrote that last time....creepy) and its very late....good morning! it's midnight o'clock, i can tell because im wearing my one dollar watch from A.C. Moore (arts and crafts store where the old bi-lo used to be near the mall) uup, now its midnight:01 wow....im coming here to write about my books that im reading currently, i just finished reading Rebecca, which was very good, it had a lot of plot twists and confusing details, i didnt realize there were so many details til i tried explaining it to my mom and it took forever and she had no clue what i was talking about.....its a novel of romantic suspense as said by the front cover, its not a bi-lo novel even tho ive never read one, but it kinda looks like it COULD be one....its pretty actually....the twist at the end is pretty freaky and if you get bored with it, keep reading cuz you'll like the end....im also reading The Case For Christ, which is a journalist's search for evidence of Jesus and if he actually existed and scientific and archeological proof and how we can rely on what the Bible says, very good book, its kind of like a book of interviews because he goes and talks to a bunch of people who are experts in their field and he records it and thats pretty much whats in the book, im barely half way done with it, if that, but it draws you in if youre at all interested in the topic, note to the dumb(as in stupid), you might have a hard time reading this book cuz theres a lot of big words...., vacation bible school was this week at our church, finally its over...it was so much fun though, the theme was "The King is Coming!" it was all medieval and stuff....lotsa fun, i was a 5 yr old class teacher thing(more like assistant, but whatever....) me and Jordan(other assistant) did a whole lot of the work....it was mostly herding and shushing...taking them to places and making them shut up whenever grownups were talking....the best part was the shark song....best in the world...it has hand motions and a catchy little tune that you will sing for MONTHS(!!!), it goes like this.... "baby shark do doo do do do do (repeat 3x) baby shark" then you go....."momma shark do doo do do do do (repeat 3x) momma shark" and you do the same for "daddy shark", "grandma shark", "goin swimmin", "shark in the water", "swimmin faster", "shark attack", "CPR", "its not working", "goin to heaven", "gonna see Jesus", and the best one is "break it down" all of these have motions, if you wanna it, just ask....i'd be more than happy to share it with you......well, im going on a kayaking/canoeing trip with my parents and some other people, i have to leave at 9:30, which is early for me, so i better go to sleep now(which will be the record for the earliest i have gone to bed this summer....).....have a nice life, and i will be back with my life report soon..... XOXO ~stace~

      back. mother woke up and saw light. then she shouted. now im back. i have noticed a strange pattern in my weekly life. sundays i wake up late and go to church. am usually late. then i come home and either eat lunch or mope around and then eat lunch. then i get on the computer or clean my room or participate in some weird family activity before freaking out and memorizing my verses hurriedly before leaving late to small group at 4. always at least 5 minutes late. then if there's hocker, i play, and if not, i come home and get on the computer or watch tv or mope around or talk to my dad or my dog or my brother or clean some more(seeing as my room is trashed since the previous cleaning) until its way late and about my bedtime when i think about homework. monday i wake up tired of 'busy' weekend. i guess its busy because im doing a lot of stuff, just not productive stuff. i dont think the quality of the work you are doing goes into the definition of 'busy'. the night before school i always swear that i will wake up early and do my homework that i was too lazy to do earlier the day before. but sure enough monday through friday i am late waking up in the morning. i usually drink apple juice for breakfast and race through the shower and blowdrying my hair then throw on some crap clothes, do my hair w/o even looking, grab some shoes, throw books in some thing people call a 'bookbag' and run to my neighbor's car as she pulls in my driveway at the ungodly hour of 7:20 in the morning. considering that i wake up at around 6:40, that's pretty good time.... during my ten minutes before school, i usually try to squeeze in some homework or extra credit assignment that is only half completed. i then go to class and can't pay attention b/c its so hard to listen to boring crap when you didnt even complete the assigned homework which is oh so essential to your understanding and general grade in the class. that sucks. we should get SOME credit for showing up....   we have to turn in our courses that we want to take next year. i am so divided. i really DO NOT want to take advanced american studies(humanities) instead of AP, but i will just fail in AP like i'm failing this year. and i havent even had AP english yet. if i take advanced then im either taking AP euro or AP chemistry 2. i absolutely love chemistry but i think my teacher feels that my grade doesnt reflect that as i have a b. and she has to recommend me for it. not just because she would be my teacher next year. i would be extremely scared of her if i waived up. plus i wouldnt be able to get out of it if i waive.   the time at my house is now 12:24 and i have so much homework to do. i have like 3 hours of chemistry bookwork to do and a worksheet for world history and wow, thats it. oh yeah, and a formal chemistry lab to type up. mucho exitamento. something like that. oh well, giving into sleep. drat it. really don't know what to do about homework as waking up early strategy never works. i will DIE if i do not get all of chemistry done b/c then my teacher will see that i can't do the work in honors so im not worthy of AP. DREAD!! oh yeah, just remembered that practically all answers are in back of book. might only take me 1.5 hours as only half of the answers are in the back of the book.:( mucho sadness but still hope i guess. well, really must pull myself away from the computer now. i must not forget my lovely blog and my fans(ha!). promise will write again soon. -stace.

      --i have a problem. i've noticed that i have this thing for cellists. (did you know that celli is the plural of cello?...anyways.) it's very sad. they're just so...mysterious and different. i don't know what's wrong with me. i like this guy and i don't even know his name. and i won't see him til next year b/c...well... just because. i am now sad. but i'm also relieved that i won't have to face him. that's my weird fetish. --this summer i really want to go to an atlanta braves game. it takes forever to drive there from my house, but i LOVE seeing baseball live. watching it on tv is boring. i mean who really cares what the pitcher's face looks like if you can't see the pitch. plus, its fun to just be there.  --rally rally, the pitcher's name is sally, hoo hoo-hoo hoo hoo. (i love it when you call me big poppa...) hardball is one of the best movies ever made. keanu reeves is really cute in most of it. g baby is the coolest little kid in that movie. i don't know what the actor's name is but he's cute too(considering it's the same person). the end is so sad i always cry. don't see the end if you don't love crying. --it's finally my spring break. the only class i don't have homework in is chemistry. that is because she likes our class to be one day behind the other classes. since we hav eit one day after they do. it makes sense in her head i promise. it's a lanni moment kind of like a hyatt moment. go stat! --i can't wait to get a journal. then i'll be able to stop publicly posting my thoughts on the internet. not that these are very personal, but that i can actually write the REAL things that go on in my mind. i've already picked out a journal that i want at barnes and noble. it's red. very pretty. i just need to earn $15 so i can go and buy it. my parents will never buy it for me. they'll buy me books sometimes, but usually only for school or in the summer when they don't like me being lazy. which i used to be, but not anymore. it's kind of sad to lose your laziness. of course you can always refer back to it when you need to. it's always there for you. that's comforting in itself i guess. things i miss i can always go back and do even though i'm getting older. wow i sound like i'm 40 or something. i'm not. not yet anyway. bye for now....       -stace-

      Daddy's little girl paints the world with her magic wand Daddy's little child breathes new life to the morning time for me Though we're apart, her thoughts follow me When I come home, Molly smiles with the dawn Molly smiles and she radiates the glow around her halo When she plays, Molly smiles On a summer day, Molly smiles A new day, Molly smiles.... ^Jesse Spencer as Neal Fox in Uptown Girls^  i totally lurved that movie, especially the end. and the sheets of egyptian cotton song. he(jesse spencer(look him up)) is very yummy scrumboes. that could have to do with the fact that he's austrailian. yay! and, he's classically trained. he's going to be in the upcoming movie called swimming upstream. it also has geoffrey rush in it. i don't know what it's about except this kid that swims and other stuff happens.  i've been so busy lately it's not even funny. sunday i had missions service and dinner and then hocker afterwards. it was soo awesome b/c we haven't played in forever. monday night i had a dance party thing at my friend kalin's house. tuesday i don't remember what i did. last night i had a worship night and then a missions meeting/overnight thingy. i stayed up until at least 2:30 in the morning and woke up at 6:30 for absolutely no reason other than the sun rose. it was awesome, though. i've never seen the sun rising anywhere near my house. i usually get up at least once when we go on trips to the mountains or the beach or something. it was cool to see it be kind of dark and then the sun comes up all red over the trees slowly, but then all of a sudden it's bright outside. it also got hot, so i went inside. then i had a pool party for our small group at church this afternoon. i came home and then worked outside 6-9pm at this lady's house. we totally redid her backyard(quite small, though). we pulled weeds and planted flowers and cleaned up. there was a TON of dead stuff that we had planted last summer for a work project. i can hardly remember exactly what we did, but it did take FOREVER. now i'm exhausted. although I HAVE NOTHING TO DO TOMORROW!!! i'm soo excited. i think i might go shopping. i NEVER go shopping. not for clothes anyway...  if you're reading this, please pray for my summer missions trip. we're going to west end bahamas. trust me, it is not the most luxurious place, but i've heard it's gorgeous. we're going to have a vacation bible school (a.k.a. VBS) for the kids there. we're also going to do work projects(like painting houses, or cleaning something up, or just doing a whole lot of yard work), community outreach stuff and door-to-door evangelism. the people there are extremely friendly. they can meet a stranger on the street and end up talking for an hour. i am NOT good at talking with strangers or anyone for that matter for extended periods of time. i hope that i know what to say and form relationships on this trip. no scopin' and hopin'-haha. i'm also nervous about the money thing. it costs $800 to go. i am not even CLOSE to that amount. please pray for me.  -stace

      Walking By Woods On A Snowy Evening by Robert Frost  Whose woods these are I think I know, His house is in the village though, He will not see me stopping here, To watch his woods fill up with snow.  My little horse must think it queer, To stop without a farmhouse near, Between the woods and frozen lake, The darkest evening of the year.  He gives his harness bells a shake, To ask if there if some mistake, The only other sound's the sweep, Of easy wind and downy flake.  The woods are lovely dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep.

      you know what i should do? live off broccoli and ice cream sandwiches. i think that would be a good plan. but the broccoli couldn't have any butter on it, and it would have to be steamed. every once in a while it could have cheese on it. or maybe it could be substituted for broccoli and cheese soup. that would be a nice liquid alternative. my brother lived off brussel sprouts and pop tarts for a few months, but&nbsp;i don't really like brussel sprouts so i think my plan is better.  -stak

      i am soo&nbsp;happy about&nbsp;my AP scores!! i actually passed my stat exam!!!!!! i got a 3, but hey, that is still credit...i only got a 2 on my world history one, but i wasn't expecting anything. i only did 1 essay of 3... i'm takin ap euro next year so i'll kick that one's butt.  jenny says that watching the movie of little women helps you come to terms with laurie and amy's marriage. NO IT DOESN'T. i think it made it worse. then again, i haven't actually read the book, which is why i got it from the library to read it. i really hate amy. she is just a little slut that took her sister's guy. of course, it's just as much laurie's fault as it is amy's. but i could never be mad at laurie. except when he marries his true love's sister. that is very wrong.  if you were walking with a friend who was a tight rope walker and he fell, that would be completely unacceptable.  i like snacks from vending machines because they fall. if i buy a candy bar, often times i will drop it to achieve the maximum flavor potential.  i'm against picketing but i don't know how to show it.  My apartment is infested with koala bears. It's the cutest infestation ever. Way better than cockroaches. When I turn on the light, a bunch of koala bears scatter, but I don't want them too. I'm like, "Hey... Hold on fellows... Let me hold one of you, and feed you a leaf." Koala bears are so cute, why do they have to be so far away from me. We need to ship a few over, so I can hold one, and pat it on its head.   Every time I go and shave, I assume there is somebody else on the planet shaving as well, so I say, "I'm gonna go shave too."   I got my hair highlighted, because I felt some strands were more important than others.   The depressing thing about tennis is that no matter how good I get, I'll never be as good as a wall.   ^mitch hedburg  -stace

How will you toast your marshmallows." -I will toast them in a barn.  -i'm so excited about goin to church tomorrow. i haven't been in like 2 weeks. and before that, almost 5ish. crap! i just remembered i missed worship night on wednesday at neely's house....erg.  -eew, i just smushed the biggest spider i've ever seen in my house. i'm not wearing shoes, so i had to&nbsp;waddle around in &nbsp;my dad's huge tevas to kill it. very thrilling. now there is a pile of dead spider gunk under the dining room table. i'm not touching it.  -stace
