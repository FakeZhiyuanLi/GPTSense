       What's up with this weather   Yesterday I went out without a coat on and it was warm out. Today it's snowing. I really wish the weather would make up it's mind.   I was reading the newspaper this morning. The babies of 2003 were listed. The most interesting part of that was that it made me feel old. There were a lot of people I know having babies and they are all people who are younger then me. I never thought of myself as getting older. And with only 12 days until my birthday I'm starting to feel it. According to John Tesh ( a radio show Adam listens to) you're not an adult until you've hit 30. So I guess that makes me feel good. lol. He says that years ago you were considered an adult at the age 18. But with the way people are today you don't reach adult hood until your thirty :S I don't know about that. But that's what he says.   Anyways. I better get going I have a lot to do today!  Happy New Year

       Merry Christmas!   I hope everyone had a great Christmas. We did. It was so fun to watch Connor get all excited. He loved his gifts and was very careful with all the wrapping paper. It was so funny to watch him tear piece by piece and hand it to someone or put it in the garbage. He wouldn't just throw it on the floor. (he must get that from his dad) Even though he was awake way past his bedtime Christmas Eve, and then really late on Christmas Day he was still such a good boy. We spent our Christmas the way we always do with Christmas Eve at Adam's parents and then Christmas Day with mine. As well as visiting friends.  I wonder what New Years is going to be like with Connor this year. I doubt he'll be able to make it to midnight! We'll see.   Happy Holidays :)

       Tomorrow's Christmas Eve   I think this is the first year in my entire life that I have left getting ready for Christmas wait this long. I had my tree up on November 15th, I even started shopping at the beginning of November. And here it is tomorrow being Christmas Eve where we go to celebrate with my husbands family and we're still not ready. Usually I have all the presents wrapped and under the appropriate tree, I have some kind of goodie baked and ready to serve, I did buy the rice crispies and marshmallows, however they are still in the cupboard.  Today is the day my grandparents make their meat pies. That's one my family traditions. Which means by the end of the day I should also be smelling home made bread in the oven. Mmmm I can't wait. The only thing missing is the snow on the ground :(   Have a blessed Christmas!

       Christmas Shopping    Have you ever just stood back and watch people as they shop at Christmas time. It's a very sad sight. People are always in a rush and get in eachothers way. Sure you're preoccupied with your thoughts but geesh relax already, it would make things a lot easier and you wouldn't get so frustrated!   I was at Walmart today, and the only thing that bothered me was that they put up these stupid center aisle things full of stuff and that's just leaving no room for people to move. Which creates "road jams" I think I might write a letter to them and suggest they don't do that. LOL think anyone will listen? Doubt it!

       White Christmas?    Well I doubt it. It's not suppose to snow much in the next few days, and so far the forecast for Christmas Eve is rain. What a bummer. But you never know, that can all change.

       I'm Back :)    Had the computer down for a few days, while we are "renovating" the house. It's been such a mess, I'm glad that it's finally almost finished down here.   KFC VS ZEHRS- Well personally, I prefer zehrs it's not as salty and actually quite tasty. Um yeah. I'm talking about the chicken. lol.   Hormones.... hmmm. I don't know how much I enjoy all these crazy hormones. One minute I can scream at someone and the next mintute I feel like I can just sit there and cry my eyes out. Only 12 more weeks to go! I can hardly wait.   I better get off the computer and go do something. Yes I'm addicted to it. lol.   Bye

       Listen...What's that noise? It's called quiet    Connor's gone to my mom's Christmas party. He just called me on the phone. He wanted to tell me he saw Santa, and deer, and buffalo, and foxes, and camels. It's so quiet in the house without him here. I just finished moving some furniture and Christmas presents to make way for my Papa to finish off the floor trim in my bedroom. Finally it's going to be done after 2 years! LOL  Back to work now.

       I Feel BLAH    I just can't seem to wake up today. Here it is twenty to two and I'm still in my P.J's. What I really feel like doing is going back to bed. I haven't even done anything today. It was nice to get the mail today and see the child tax benefit come in early, that was a nice surprise. Sometimes our Canadian government isn't all that bad I guess. LOL. Connor's all excited to go to my mom's Christmas party tomorrow at Zooz to see Santa. He'll be estatic when he finds out Santa got him a BIG dump truck! Only problem is where the heck am I going to put it :S Well I guess I'm going to go have my shower now, then maybe a nap.

       One month to my birthday!    You'd think that I'd stop counting the days till I am another year older. But really it's no big deal to me. Yesterday was a good day, we visited Adam's mom and dad and had pizza for dinner. Unfortunatley my tummy or should I say baby didn't agree with pizza for dinner. I was up all night with a sore tummy. I feel much better today. This morning I wake up and go and get Connor and find him hiding in his closet. He's such a cutie. It's suppose to snow tonight! Hooray.... I love the snow.

       Another early start to another boring day!   At 8:00 this morning comes the knock at the door. The guy was here to put the new floor in. Which looks really nice by the way! Then I hear bang bang bang, as my dad runs down the stairs looking for my car keys. Needless to say, I didn't want to wake up yet. Connor was awake last night at 2:30am and I didn't sleep well all night. My big pregnant belly keeps getting in the way and having a big stuffed animal named Adam right next to me in my not so big bed doesn't help either. The highlight of my day was going out to run errands. Went to Walmart to return some presents that we bought, and scrounging $5.00 out of my purse all to put enough money in our bank account to cover bills. Why is it at Christmas time we're always broke :( So we come home to adjust our line of credit. Smart aren't we, get ourselves into even more debt. We need a new car, a house and have too many bills to pay. Lifes wonderful isn't it. :P

       IT'S 8:00 IN THE MORNING WHY AM I AWAKE?    Well I guess the answer to that is because I'm a mom. Connor woke up this morning much earlier then his usual 9:30am routine. And you'd think that since he has chickenpox, he'd be tired, or feeling ill, but nope, he's happy and playing and insisted on waking up mommy. That's okay, I guess... I need to get use to the morning hours once again. I'm expecting another baby in March. I've been feeling pretty good, now that the morning sickness has gone. Oh yes Morning Sickness, one of the joys of pregnancy. Waking up in the morning and dashing off to the bathroom to puke my guts out. Thank goodness it only lasted a few months this time. I'm now 6 months pregnant. Oh the cutest thing about Connor waking me up now, is that he realizes he's waking up the baby too. He says Mommy up now, Megan up now too! and claps his hands and gives my tummy a kiss. How can I possibly get mad at him for waking me up like that! Plus the poor little guy has the chickenpox. Which I'm not happy about at all, but it's not like I can be mad at anyone, the person who gave it to him didn't know she had them. That's what's so stupid about them. Your contagious before you even know you're going to get them. Oh well get it over with I guess. Hmmm I smell coffee, I'm off to get some now. Until another day. Take Care.

      Went to bingo a few times in the past couple weeks, and haven't been very lucky. My mom has though :) Which is great cause we split what we win. However when I was pregnant for Connor I won over $8000.00 with this pregnancy I have only won about $40.00 lol. Guess that should tell me something!

       Good Morning   I can't believe how fast January is going. Today is the 23rd already! Only one week left of January. Speaking of the 23rd.  Happy Birthday to our friend Mark. Hope you have a great day and enjoy you're time off work .  Speaking of work. I really hate it when people ask me do I have a job. Of course I say no, because I don't really have a job that I get paid to do. But don't you think being a full time mom is a job? I personally think it's one of the hardest jobs there is. You have so much to worry about, so much responsibility and it's a non stop 24 hour a day 365 days a year job. At least they have a day dedicated to us moms. :D No I haven't forgotten dads too. And I must give my husband 2 gold stars he has two full time jobs which I think he does great at. I don't know how he does it sometimes.   Valentines Day is coming up. Connor has noticed all the decorations at the stores and stuff. He thinks it's Christmas again. lol.   Well have a good day bye for now :)

       30 weeks! Already!     I'm now 30 weeks into my pregnancy! It's hard to believe how fast it's gone by. I only have 8 more weeks to go. Which makes me a little nervous. Considering how fast the first 30 weeks have gone. We are slowly getting things ready but don't actually have anything accomplished really. We have the baby's clothes that we got as hand me downs all sorted out and ready to be washed. I don't know why some people don't like hand me downs. I love them. It's a great way to save money and if someone else wore them on their child then the clothes must be cute. What parent puts their baby in ugly clothes. lol. We have the baby's dresser cleared out of all our DVD's and lined the drawers with some paper. All it needs now is clothes in it. And we have a package of newborn diapers. That's all we have done. As for how I've been feeling... It's funny how everyone asks you that when you're pregnant. Cause they don't really want to know, you can say to them. Well my feet hurt, my back hurts, I can't bend over to put my own socks and shoes on let alone try and reach to shave my legs, I can't sleep, my clothes don't fit and I feel like a blimp, I'm hot all the time and how do you think you'd feel with your hormones all out of whack. So instead you simply just say "I'm feeling fine thanks"   Some people sure are gutsy when you're out in public. I've had a few woman say to me, are you having twins? In other words holy crap you're huge! And then there was this woman who came up to me at bingo and rubbed my belly, she had a mouth full of food and started talking to me. She's lucky I didn't puke on her. Some people I tell yah!   Anyways!  I hope you're having a good day :)

       Let it Snow Let it Snow Let it Snow :)    Winter sure took it's time getting here, but it's here now in full force. We have at least 10 inches of snow outside! Connor and I had a great time yesterday making a snowman. Making a snowman is hard work to begin with, but doing so when you're 7 months pregnant is something else. But I really enjoyed the time I spent outdoors with Connor.  I turned 26 on Sunday the 11th. And unlike some other birthdays I've had, I don't feel any different. I also went to the hospital on the 10th of Jan. I was having a strange congested feeling in my lower abdomen. It seems to have stopped somewhat but the odd time I still feel it. They checked the baby on the fetal heart monitors and my doctor also examined me. I go to the doctor tomorrow to see if there was any kind of infection at all, and she may send me for an ultrasound. Not too much longer to go now I keep telling myself. I'm due the 29th of March, but the baby will be born early due to the fact I'm having a C-section. I'm pretty nervous about that. I didn't have a good experience with it the first time. Hopefully things will be better this time.   It's snowing again today, but I don't think we'll be going outside to play. Yesterday took too much out of me.

       Snow Snow Snow   Here it is January 4th and as of snow we really haven't had any. I love the winter. I enjoy waking up to a winter wonderland. I like to go ice skating and tobogganing. I love to make snowmen and get all frozen to come in and have some hot chocolate to warm up. I don't know maybe it has something to do with me being born in January, maybe not. I must admit though. Since I am pregnant this winter, it is nice not having to worry about going out for a walk and falling or having to worry about the fact that my winter coat doesn't fit around my huge belly!   Have a great day!

       2004   What a way to bring in the new year. I've got a cold or the flu or whatever but I feel like crap. I didn't sleep hardly at all last night. I hope it doesn't last very long. We had a nice quiet New Years at home. Sat with family and friends and waited for midnight. Connor stayed awake and was very excited when everyone started counting down from 10. Then we all said cheers with our wine glasses of juice and/or chanmpagne.  It was fun. In 2004 we are waiting patiently for the arrival of our new baby girl. Our only hope is that she's healthy and arrives safely. My brothers getting married in March as well. So I won't be going to the wedding. He's getting married in Florida the same week I'm due to have the baby. How nice is that. We don't even know if my mom's going to be able to make it. I know I wouldn't have gotten married if my family couldn't be there with me.   ANYWAYS!    HAPPY NEW YEAR

      Well every kid does it sometime or another. Today was the day it was Connor's turn. He put some little yellow cap like things into the vcr of my mom's tv. I think we'll be able to get them out. Luckily it was that and not some kind of food or something that can't be taken out.

      I looked at the calander today and realized that this is the last week of February already! I'm now 35 weeks pregnant, and in less then a month it's going to be spring and in only 2 short months it's time to change the clocks again.  Where does the time go?  Not much is new around here, that's why I haven't blogged in awhile. The three of us have colds and that's about it.

      Tonight Adam and I are going out for dinner for Valentine's day. I just realized that in about 4 weeks we won't be going out just the two of us anymore for a very long time. We didn't buy eachother gifts for Valentine's Day... that's okay though, we bought Connor a few things, a doctors set, an outfit and a little fish game.   Hope you all have a Happy Day!

      My mom had her hysterectomy done on Monday. She's doing very well and feeling good. When I got home from the hospital Connor asked for his Grams. He misses her and has been asking for her every day since then. She'll be home tomorrow Thursday. Today we are going to bring him to see her, to help him realize that Grams has a boo boo and he has to be gentle with her when she gets home. He has a bad habit of jumping up on people. Hopefully this will help him realize that once mommy has the baby, he can't be climbing up on me either! Only 5 more weeks to go!

      I couldn't fall asleep last night. I was up until almost 4am. Luckily Connor didn't wake up this morning until almost 10:00am. Right now he's upstairs with his grandfather and great grandfather. One day I hope he realizes how lucky he has been to have all of his grandparents and great grandparents. And how even more lucky he is to have spent so much time with his great grandparents. Not many people get a chance to do that!

      Friday I won a little bit of money on Super 7. It's the first time I've ever won more then $10.00 or a free ticket. Too bad it's all gone already. LOL.   Tomorrow is Groundhog Day! Whether that crazy critter sees his shadow or not it's still way too cold out and it's still winter to me until this insane amount of snow is gone. It just keeps coming. I think that little fish was singing "just keep snowing, just keep snowing" and not swimming and somebody was actually listening to her!

      Megan is two weeks old today. I can't get over how fast has gone by. It's been a good two weeks. Megan slept her first whole night. From 11:30pm to 9:30am :D What a good girl. Connor is very much enjoying his new sister. He's always asking to see her or hold her or where she is. He's such a good big brother.   It's been beautiful out the past two days. Connor got to spend a lot of time outdoors. Which is really good. After such a long cold winter of being couped up indoors, it feels nice to go out and enjoy the outdoors. Unfortuanatley they are calling for rain for the rest of the week :(

      It's been a week already! Megan arrived safe and is doing very well. Many people have told me that having your second child is much easier then your first and they were right, I'm much more relaxed, much more aware of what's going on and what to do. There is nothing better in this world then being a mom in my opinion :) The one thing that has surprised me is that the lack of sleep I'm getting isn't half as bad as it was the first time around either. I must admit though,  Adam has been wonderful. I couldn't ask for a better husband. And he has enjoyed this experience more then the first time as well.   We couldn't be happier :)

      Well tomorrow is the big day. God willing, everything will go okay and soon we'll be a happy family of four. Connor's really looking forward to his sister coming home. He's already telling me all the things he wants to do with his sister. Sing to her, play with her, read her books. It's so sweet. We'll see how it actually goes when she comes home. lol.   I'm a little nervous, but I'm sure I'll be fine tomorrow.   Well I'm off to do all the last minute things that needs to be done!  Take Care

      It has been so nice out the past week or so and today I woke up to about a half an inch of snow! I didn't think it was gone for good. This shouldn't last though. So I guess it's okay.  In 7 more days I'll be in the hospital having our second baby. I can't believe how fast the time has went by. I just pray that everything will go okay and soon we'll have our little boy and girl at home with us :)   Have a happy day!

      The other day my mom and Connor were sitting out on the porch, we have three chairs out there. Two white ones and one green one that is cracked. My mom had told him to be careful on the green chair because it's cracked and we have to put it in the dump! Well yesterday my mom took us out for dinner to BP (boston pizza) we were sitting waiting for our food when Connor says to us. Theres the dump!  When he looked out to the patio and saw all the green chairs he thought it was the dump!

      Yesterday was a fun day. We took Connor to Happy Ralphs petting farm. Unfortunately the animals weren't out yet. He didn't mind though. We told him the animals were sleeping.  So we played in the park and went to see the ducks and geese. He had such a good time and didn't want to leave. After that we went to Walmart LOL what else is new. There we bought Connor a pair of rain boots. He's so excited about them. Our back yard is nothing but dirt right now and so we got him the boots so he can come and help us work out there. And he loves to jump in puddles so now he knows he can do that but only with his new blue boots. Well this morning when we woke up it was raining. The first thing he said to me was " I go outside now with my new boots" Then when my grandmother went to bring him to church he wanted to wear his new boots. I'm afraid I'm not going to hear the end of the new blue boots until I let him go out and play in the rain. Unfortunately he's just getting over a cold, so he's just going to have to wait until he's better.

      Yesterday was a good day. We spent the day shopping, didn't buy much until we went to Wal-Mart. Then at night Adam and I went out on a "date" for the first time in over 5 months. It was really nice. We went to the show to see Jersey Girl with Ben Affleck! It was a really good movie only they should have Kleenex boxes in the cup holders lol. Adam fed Megan her first bottle yesterday. She took it very well and seemed to enjoy having Daddy feed her. Connor had a good day playing with his cousins.  Today... I got bored. So I decided to tear down the wall paper in the bathroom. It needs re painting anyways,  so now I'll HAVE to do it. lol. I just hope it's soon. Connor had so much fun helping me. After that I cleaned his room up. Toys should all compact themselves somehow so that they don't take up so much room.   Tomorrow...Who knows maybe I'll tackle cleaning out my closets and dresser drawers!

      Megan is one month old today! I've said it before and I'll say it again. I can't believe how quickly the time has gone. We had rain the other day. It sure made the grass green, and the buds on the trees are really starting to pop out now. Before you know it it'll be summer!

      Saturday we took Connor to Firemans Park, thinking that the Fireman's Easter Egg Hunt was to start at 11am. It turned out it was on the Friday. Thank goodness I brought a bag of eggs with me just incase. So Connor had a great time finding eggs out in the park. Sunday morning when he woke up he was so excited that the Easter Bunny had come. There is nothing better then to see the excitement on your childs face.  After egg hunting, we all went to church. Even though the "Easter Bunny" is fun and all. We do make sure our kids know the true meaning of the holidays.  This was Megan's first Easter, she looked so cute dressed in her jean dress and stockings :)

      It's Friday already! Last night Adam worked the longest he's worked in a very long time. Hopefully he'll get a good sleep this afternoon so that he's okay to go into work tonight. When you're not use to that kind of thing it really is hard.   It's been cold and rainy the past few days, that's spring for you I guess. Won't be long now and it'll start warming up. Tomorrow is my grandmothers 65th birthday. We're having a party for her. It should be fun.   Went to Sears the other day to spend our $30.00 gift certificates.  All we got was a toy car for Connor, an outfit for Megan(which was 30% off) and an Easter basket. Which came to $38.00!!! Isn't that insane! It's the craziest thing I ever heard of. You have to spend over the amount of the certificate and you have to use your Sears card and the remaining balance has to go on that card and with a 28% interest rate it's just not worth it. Thieves I tell yah. At Walmart we could have gotten 2 outfits for Megan, 2 cars for Connor and them each an Easter basket for that much! I don't know why anyone shops at Sears!

      I'm afraid this blog won't be too interesting... I went to bingo today, didn't win though :( When we got home we had dinner (Lobster and Fries)and now Connor's gone for a walk with my mom. Megan's asleep on the couch and Adam's gone to work. What a boring life I live. I read a funny bumper sticker today.   EARTH'S FULL.... GO HOME   Well I thought it was funny anyway.

      We went camping for the long weekend. What a weekend that was. We had thunderstorm after thunderstorm and non stop rain all weekend long. We still had a good time though. Our friend Sharon was there with her boyfriend and his two kids and the kids got to play a little bit. We fed fish and splashed in the puddles. Overall Connor was pretty good. What can you expect from a three year old cooped up in a trailer for 3 days with nothing to do!  When we got home it was nice to see that our grass is finally starting to grow. Pretty soon we'll have a yard to play in again. It wasn't so nice to see that our neighbours are moving. You finally get good neighbours and they go and move on you. Only good thing about it is I'm really hoping to look into buying the house. It's perfect for what we need right now except that it has only two bedrooms but there is a third downstairs,and it's right next door how convenient is that! I wouldn't be home "alone" at night like I'm afraid of, and Connor wouldn't really go through any kind of separation anxiety from my mom and grandparents. Since we've lived with them his whole life. I doubt we'll be able to do it, but I sure hope it's at least somewhat possible. I can pray anyway!

      Last night Adam and I went to see TROY. It was a really good movie. The only complaint I have is that the cameras were too close during the fight scenes. Kinda made me dizzy. But maybe I was dizzy from watching Brad looking all fine! HAHA

      Today was a nice day. We spent the morning inside cleaning and stuff. I finally got the highchair cleaned up and ready for Megan to use. Then after lunch the four of us went outside. Adam washed, cleaned and vaccumed the car. I washed down the driveway, and Connor played in the puddles and dirt while Megan napped. After that we took a quick trip to Wal Mart. Came home made dinner and cleaned up.   Apparently from my cousins comment Scotland isn't having much warm weather. Well today was pretty cool outside it's only 15 outside. It's perfect camping weather. I think next weekend we are going to go camping. I'm not sure yet though, I have to call the doctor about my incision.(from my C-Section) I think it may be infected again. Which really sucks. Just yesterday I was saying it was all cleared up and fine, then last night when I checked it it was all red and I've had some spotting. I'm hoping everything will be okay and they won't have to open me up again. I don't know what I'd do if I had to stay in the hospital. It's been 2 months it should be healed by now!

      Time to pull out the sunscreen again. Today is so hot and sunny.  Connor was helping Adam rake dirt out in the back yard. He was making more work for Adam then anything else. It was especially funny when he knocked over the wheelbarrow!

      It's a nice day. It was starting to get cloudy but the rain is holding off. I wish I had a backyard that's not full of mud. I'd like to get outside with Connor and Megan. Summer just seems to be taking forever to get here. Which is probably a good thing, I don't want to rush summer this year. I hate the hot weather but not liking the cold weather too much right now. I think I might be getting old. lol

      Connor turned three yesterday! We had friends and family over for pizza and cake. He got some really neat presents. It's suppose to rain this afternoon, but hopefully it'll hold off so that he can get outside and drive his John Deere Gator Truck.    Tonight is the Series Finale of FRIENDS :( Come this fall tv is really going to suck. We only have one show left that we watch " ER" and that'll be over soon too.

      Today my mom took Connor to the Toronto Zoo. He LOVES animals. He's going to have such a good time. Megan is sleeping and so is Adam. I should be but can't seem to get tired enough to lay down. So I'm enjoying my computer time. I should be using this time to start sorting through all my stuff for our yard sale. But soon Adam's going to wake up and we're going to go out and run some errands. It's quite chilly outside today. Three years ago today, I was in the hospital in labour. Tomorrow is Connor's 3rd birthday! How quickly the time has gone.

       11 to 7 hooray for Megan!  Megan slept through the night last night. Yay for mommy. It's so nice to get a full 5 hours sleep instead of 5 hours broken sleep.  Today is my grandfathers 68th birthday. Happy Birthday Papa! Connor will be turning three on Wednesday! I can't believe it. He's growing up way to fast. Yesterday he bit his sisters nose. I don't think he realizes that she can hurt too since she doesn't say much. But when she started crying he was really sorry he did it. My mom told me when I was little I use to bite my brothers fingers just to make him cry. LOL.. kids eh.   I'm patiently waiting for my bathroom to dry up. I really want to get working on it. Get a new floor and paint and stuff. Hopefully by the end of the month that can be accomplished. The livingroom paint can wait.   Have a good day!

      Yesterday Adam and I celebrated our 5th wedding anniversary. We woke up early and opened our gifts. I got a lovely gold chain. He really surprised me! Nobody had to remind him to get me anything or even help him with any ideas. After 5 years he's finally learning  We spent the day preparing for Megan's Christening. Which is today at 1:00pm. For dinner we decided to check out the new Fallsview Casino Resort. What a night. It took us an hour just to find a parking spot at the shuttle lot. Then a half hour wait to get on the darn shuttle. We get there, and look around nothing spectacular, then we get into yet another line and wait another half hour for dinner. The Grand Buffet. It was good food and well worth our $42.00...I guess. But I don't think I'll go back. After dinner which was around 11:30pm when we left at 7:30pm lol, we decided to spend $20.00 on slots. Well we put the $20 in and it was gone in less then three minutes. We said okay lets go home. But first we went to take a look at this fountain our city spent millions of dollars on, It was the ugliest thing I've ever seen. It looked like a big wheel with a stick on it and it was blue and wet! We get out of the casino to find yet another line, and waited a good 20 minutes to get back on the shuttle. We get home at 12:30am. Personally, I like Casino Niagara better then the new Fallsview Casino, however, I'll never figure out why we need TWO casinos in this city!

      Yesterday one of our Neon Tetra's died. I'm surprised they have lasted this long. We bought them a year and 2 months ago. We are now down to 3 neon tetras and 1 Black Phantom Tetra. I'm considering buying more fish, however, I am also considering waiting until the others die off and just closing up the tank. Now that I have two kids I find it difficult to find the time to clean the tank, I even have a hard time remembering to feed them. I don't know we'll see what happens...   What is up with this weather it's only 14!

      When I sat down to have my coffee and breakfast doughnut this morning, I always read the back of the paper first. Just something weird that I do I guess.... Well today I read that my cousins (Carrie, Shannon, Lisa & Lorraine)grandmother has passed away. My thought and prayers are with you all. Mrs. MacIntosh was a lovely woman, I'll always remember playing her piano when I was young with my Carrie and Shannon who taught me to play Twinkle Twinkle little star.   Also today I got to go through two houses on our street. The one next door again and another at the end of our street. They are asking way to much for them but it was good to look at what I'm getting into. I think I'm dreaming but I can still hope I guess. On Wednesday next week a guy is coming to see what we can get as of a mortgage. I guess the worst he can say is ZERO!    I'm off to bed. Have a good night!

      Today is the first day of summer. Hopefully!!! it will start to warm up now? It's 19 degrees outside right now and it's only 10:28am. So today is looking good!   Yesterday I got all my hair chopped off. My hair has always been  really really  long, like half way down my back almost to my butt. Mostly I like it long because I have curly hair and the weight helps to control the curl. But I get bored and end up cutting my hair. It's up to my shoulders now! So I whine about it for a few weeks, then I get over it.   I'm off to have a happy day, I hope you will have one too!

      In the last 3 days, We have been to Walmart repeatedly. Not just one walmart oh no no no... all FOUR of them! On Wednesday we had a picture of Connor enlarged in Niagara Falls. Then went home. On Thursday we went to Walmart in Welland for something to do and bought nothing! Almost bought stuff but decided not to bother with debit for such few items. There has been only 3 or 4 times EVER we've left Walmart without buying anything! Then I don't know what happened but later that night we went back to the Niagara Falls store and ended up spending $100.00 on stuff!!!.. Then today we got two other pictures enlarged (in Niagara Falls)The greeter lady looked at us funny! Then of course we needed to buy frames! We have a frame, an old one that we bought at Walmart, about 3 years ago. It's dark wood, Anyways... We wanted two more of them. Niagara Falls didn't have it.. But we did buy some fathers day presents and cards. Then we went to Walmart on 4th Ave in St. Catharines... Didn't find the frames, but found some Krispy Kremes Doughnuts! Ohhhh so yummy! How come we don't have them at our Walmart:S Then after there we  decided to keep looking and go to Walmart on Welland Ave, in St. Catharines, again no frame to match. Okay after 4 walmart we figure they don't make the darn frame we want anymore, so we buy three new ones and a level. Why Adam wanted a level for pictures I have no idea. I know they'll be level we've had other pictures up there for years why would they suddenly not be level now! Anyways. We got our frames and our pictures and everything looks good. Oops I forgot cards and a gift for Adam for Fathers Day. Guess I have to go back to Walmart tomorrow! I wish that it was open 24 hours like the ones in the States. When we were on our vacation in Ohio last year, we went to walmart at 1:00 in the morning~ It was so much fun...  okay.. Yeah...Um...My name is Jennifer and this is my husband Adam and we are addicted to WALMART!

       urlLink    This is Connor having a great time in his new tent he got for his 3rd birthday from Grandma and Grandpa. Hopefully our backyard will grow grass soon so that we can spend a night camping out in the backyard. He's still camping with his great grandparents and will be home on Tuesday. While he's been gone we've caught up on some movies that we can't watch with him here. Megan's wonderful she's such a good baby. Last night she slept from 10pm to 8:15am! I forget how easy it is to only have one child to look after. But wouldn't give up two for the world. I'd like to have four, but need a house before that can happen. Hm maybe we can all just live in tents! lol. &nbsp; urlLink

      Connor's been gone for three days now. It's been very quiet here. I miss him. Megan is pretty quiet, with a baby in the house you'd expect more crying and stuff, but there isn't.  But I'm glad Connor's having a good time. Yesterday he went fishing with Papa. I think it's great that he's getting to spend some time with his great grandparents. I'm so happy he's able to experience camping with them, just as I have. They are getting older now at the ages of 65 and 68 and health problems here and there. You never know how much time they have left to do such things. I wouldn't have let him go if I didn't think they could handle him. He's a really good boy and they are going to have a lot of fun. I am the oldest of 8 grandchildren. We range from the ages of 26 to 2. And my children are the only great grandchildren as of yet. If I had a metal of some sort I'd give it to my Nanny and Papa for worlds best grandparents! They have brought us all camping (sometimes all at the same time!) throughout the years. Not to mention all the other things they've done for us. Some people would probably say they'd get the metal for worlds craziest grandparents! LOL.  My grandparents have never lived on their own, just the two of them. Their whole married life of 47 years they have ALWAYS had someone live with them, whether it be their 4 children, their in-laws, a sister or a brother, grandkids, and great grand kids, ex- son in laws the whole bit. If there is anyone you can count on it's my grandparents. Some people find it strange that I live with my Mother, Nanny, Papa, Husband, Kids and right now my Dad too. 8 people in this house! Most people think they'd go nuts. But actually it's not all that bad. There is always someone home if you forgot your key, or want someone to watch T.V with or talk to. If you go out and leave your window open and it starts to rain there will be someone here to close it for you. I have never lived on my own so it's not strange for me. I think I'd go nuts if I did live on my own. Although I'd really like a house of my own now. We need more room. I'd like to have more kids and that's just not possible living here. I'd also like a dog.  That's enough rambling for now. I know I'm not that interesting!

      Today I woke up a little earlier then I would have liked to. Megan didn't sleep all the way through the night but that's okay. 8pm to 1am and then from 1am to 5am to 9am is pretty darn good! Connor was up at 9:30am. We lazed around a bit in the morning then when my grandparents were on their way out the door to go camping they decide to take Connor too. I kept saying no, because I didn't think they'd want to have him for a whole week, but they insisted and after telling him yes and made him all happy I couldn't really say no. So we scrambled around and packed him up for a week and he's off to the Arkona in the London area camping. He woke up with a stuffy nose, so I hope he's going to be okay. Then I realized today that the 20th is Father's Day and he's not going to be here in the morning. Which isn't really all that big of a deal, but I sure hope he's home way before Adam has to go to work. Then today Megan and I went to my cousin Tracy's Garden Party In honour of her 30th birthday. It was very nice. We sat outside in our sundress and thankfully it didn't rain! We had sandwiches and fruit and punch and talked and then we went in to a set "cafe" like thing and had strawberry shortcake and tea and coffee and she opened her presents. It was really fun. It was nice for me to get out of the house for the day just Megan and me and have a little "GIRL" time. Now I'm home in my jammies and Megan's asleep. She's been asleep almost ALL day! So I'm kind of thinking to get to bed early tonight. But then again, she can sleep all night! I don't know.

Next Connor will get it and then Adam and then we'll all be miserable. It's one thing for the mom to be sick that's easy to take care of. A sick three year old and a sick three month old and a sick thirty year old male no less! lol. Hmmm that's alot of threes! Anyways. we all know that's not fun!   It's a nice day today. Maybe some fresh air will do me good.

      It's been a hectic few days. I'm not entirely sure why because I haven't done much. Been to bingo a few times and that's about it really. Yesterday we (Adam, Connor, Megan and I) went out for dinner to Boston Pizza. Connor really enjoys going there, mostly for the balloon and cookie when he leaves. It was quite busy and a magician came and did some magic tricks for Connor. He really liked that, and what a great way to keep him occupied while waiting for dinner to arrive! Today I cut and colored my Aunt Donna's hair, it turned out nice. I also cut Connors, Erins & Ethans hair too. Then tonight Adam and I went to a meeting for Megan's baptism. I really enjoyed it. I like our new priest Father Umba I think his name is. He's from Africa the Congo. He's very interesting to listen to and he puts so much feeling into what he has to say. The expression he puts into his words keeps your attention going that's for sure. Megan's baptism is on the 27th of June. I hope it's not terribly hot. It's the day after our 5th wedding anniversary, and if it's anything like the weather we had on our wedding day! YIKES. It was the hottest day of 1999. I feel like I am forgetting to do something. I hate when that happens. Both kids are in bed, maybe I should go to bed too. Adam's gone to the show with my mom.  hm. Yup I think that's all I had to say today. I feel a little scatterbrained!

      Today I was on a mission to get things done! I called the doctor and made an appointment for myself. We got the bathroom 99% finished, all it needs now is a floor. I got a few other things done today as well, one of them being buy a new dress for Megan's Christening. That was the impossible part. I went to about 7 stores before I finally found something I liked. It's black with a hot pink floral pattern. I know it doesn't sound all that nice, but I assure you it's pretty.  I'm so lucky I have a husband who doesn't mind shopping! Connor was really good too. Megan slept the whole time as usual. After shopping we came home and had McDonalds for supper. Who feels like cooking after shopping all day. Then my mom decided to take Connor camping for the weekend. So that's nice. Hopefully I'll get some much needed sleep. However I'll probably find myself sitting at the computer most of the time. lol. Off to do some more things now!

      It's been a tiring past few days. We've been busy fixing up and painting our bathroom. We've chosen the colour Neptune Blue. It's really dark for such a small room, but once the accent colour (white) is in there it's going to look really nice I think. It's been fun though, trying to get stuff done with two kids, one seems to always be hungry right when you're in the middle of something and one of them always trying to "help" it gets to be frustrating.  I haven't gotten much sleep in the past two days. I feel like I'm coming down with something, my throat is kinda sore and my eyes are sore. It's probably just lack of sleep. Maybe I'll try and get a nap today after I put the second coat of paint on. I know one thing. Connor is not going to have a nap today. Yesterday he didn't fall asleep till almost 11pm when he's usually in bed and asleep no later then 9:30pm. He woke up at 8:30 this morning so with no nap today he should get to bed on time. HOPEFULLY!  Today's the first day of June, we have alot going on this month. Well alot for us anyway.  Birthdays, Anniversary's, Baptism, Party's, Doctor's and Dentist appointments! And whatever else. Our calander is usually pretty empty.   Have a nice day!

       urlLink    I"M SO HAPPY my search has finally!!! come to an end. Today we took a trip to Fort Erie to check out the Wal Mart there. No such luck as to find any Cabbage Patch Kids. So I said " that's it, we're going back to the other Wal Mart and we're buying the one we saw the other day!"  We get there, head straight for the toy section and HOORAY!! More CPK's have arrived! Megan has now adopted Lolita Karin. She has butterscotch hair pony's, two cute pink bows in her hair and the cutest pink dress with pink socks and shoes. . Here is a picture of her. I don't think I'll give her to Megan for a few years of course.  I'm so tempted to go back and adopt the other cuties. But at 39.95 each. I better not. :S  Hope you all had a nice day :)  &nbsp; urlLink

      Yesterday was crazy. We left our house at 12:30pm. We went over to that Taka Peek store in search for a Cabbage Patch Kid for Megan. Well this store is a dump. I mean people donate stuff for a reason, and this store is so that they don't have to pay to bring their stuff to a dump. I couldn't believe the stuff in that store. Sure there were some good finds, we even bought a coffee mug and another glass. Then left. As soon as we got into the car I washed everyone's hands with a wipe.&nbsp; Then we took a look at the goodwill store. Mainly to see if any of our stuff we brought was put out. And it was :) So we come home only to feed the baby and grab a quick sandwich for ourselves and then we were off again. We did have certain items on our list to get. So we looked for our want items and put off our needed items until we were finished. First store Walmart #1&nbsp;we look for the doll we look at the exercaucer. We decide that all the walmarts have the same exersaucers and just get it there.&nbsp; So there done. That's over with~ even though it's not the one I wanted and I don't really like it much. But&nbsp;it's up and Megan uses it and we'll see how it goes. So now to the toy section. Not at all expecting to find anything just to look.When I'm standing in this aisle for quite sometime letting Connor play with some toys. I turn to my right and what do I see!!! 6 CABBAGE PATCH KIDS!! I couldn't believe it. I was so exited until I noticed they were all black dolls. Which don't get me wrong. I am not a prejudice person at all. I will even go back to get one of those cuties if I don't find the one I am looking for. Adam didn't care of the colour either, he just questioned " what will other people say if our child has a black doll?" To answer his question I say.." Who cares?. I don't". So we say to ourselves... Well if they have them here they'll have them at another store. So we take our exersaucer and leave. On to Walmart #2. We get there&nbsp;and no they don't have the dolls. Okay lets go. Walmart #3. Nope.. no luck there either. We pick up our needed items and cash out. Baby is hungry. My aunt lives just around the corner. Lets go there. It's now 6:00pm. I feed the baby and get a tour of her new house. It's VERY nice!&nbsp; My mom calls and says "hey have you guys eaten dinner yet?" no I reply. Okay meet me at Fine Kettle of Fish.&nbsp;We go for dinner. Come home put the kids to bed watch a movie and go to sleep. Do you think my search is over? Not a chance. I'm off to Walmart #4 this afternoon!

       urlLink    In my search for a Cabbage Patch Kid for my daughter I have come across this old car. I have one of these! It looks like this exact one. My Photoing On Car. I got it from my grandmother when I was very little. I never played with it and I have only taken it out of it's box to show certain people I feel worthy enough to share my toy with, but they are NOT allowed to touch it! It drives around and honks and the girl turns and takes a picture, the camera flashes and then it repeats itself. I keep it in its box up in a safe place. I sometimes think I might take it out to show my son but then I think I better not he might touch it. I don't think I have ever even shown my husband how it works.&nbsp;I don't think that anyone else has ever placed even a single finger on my car. I may be crazy,&nbsp;but it's mine and it's old and it's in perfect conditon. If I ever decide to pass it down to my daughter or grandchild it will come with strict instructions not to play with it or let anyone else play with it. I love my car. It's very special to me. &nbsp; urlLink

      On Friday I spent the day watching my kids. We played games, watched T.V. at ice cream out on the porch. I made signs for our yardsale and got sick of the smell of black permanent marker. Went to bed, didn't get much sleep. Megan has kept me up all night. I wake up finally at 6:20am Saturday to Adam saying time to get up we got lots to do! I whine - but I just got to bed! So I drag myself out of bed and make some coffee. I feed Megan and send her up to my mom. Mom's not happy to be up before 7am. We start dragging all of our stuff out of the house onto the drive way.&nbsp; People start slowing down infront of my house.&nbsp; THE SIGN SAYS 8 idiot! So we hurry we don't want to lose out on a sale. So finally the people start coming and the things start leaving. It was so nice to see some things go. There are other things Adam had a hard time letting go. He got over it. We had a beautiful day. The sun was shining it was nice and warm. Couldn't ask for better weather. The day goes on and people&nbsp;come and go. It starts to slow down around 3pm. So we start to pack up our leftovers. My dishes didn't go :( I was sad about that cause I wanted new dishes. The other stuff that didn't sell we piled back up in the laundry room.&nbsp; Then we counted our money! $209.00 YIPEE!!! we were so happy. But the big bonus of the day was when my mom called me from bingo and told me she won the Super Jackpot! woohoo! $1500.00 for me. I think to myself I'm so glad we made that deal to split whatever we win wheather or not we go. So we go out for dinner cause we are too exhausted to even think of making something. But of course first we stop at the bank and pay off our visa, get us out of overdraft and put some more to save for other stuff we need, bills, etc. :( all that money's gone! didn't take long did it. So today we wake up, look at the pile in the laundry room and think. It's gotta go. All of it. Right now today. So we pack up the car and drop some off into the Diabetes bin. Aw the relief. So we needed to finish. We go back home fill the trunk once again and head off to the GoodWill store. There you go. thank you very much. It's gone :) ALL GONE! my laundry room is nice an clean and tidy and EMPTY!!! After months of tripping over boxes and stepping on crap it's gone. I find myself going in there just to walk around in a big circle. :)  Also today we went to Walmart. We have money now so we gotta go to walmart. We buy a few things we needed like paper towels and such. Then have some lunch while we wait for our film to be developed at Zehrs. We'd get it done at walmart but unfortunlatly Zehrs does a better job. So we go to McDonalds for lunch at Walmart while we wait. Megan gets cranky and it's time for her lunch. So we run pick up our pictures and off home to feed her. I feed her and realize all the things I forgot to buy when at walmart. So we pack the kids up once again and back to walmart for the second time today. Good thing it was a different greeter at the door. It hadn't even been an hour. He'd think we were crazy. Maybe we are. So we pick up the rest of our things we need and it's back home again. I clean the kitchen. Lay on the couch. Get up and wash the kitchen floor while Adam vacuums and does laundry. I then make dinner. I'm really tired today. I have a bad headache that won't go away. It's suppose to rain tomorrow I hope it does. Megan's in bed and now I have to get Connor to bed. It's almost 9pm. I think I may get to bed early tonight and I pray I get more then 3 hours of broken sleep. But first I have some reading of blogs to catch up on :)

      I finally got the kids to bed and it's not quite 8:30pm yet.&nbsp;Our Yard&nbsp;Sale is on Saturday. &nbsp;I found Adam digging through cupboards today going&nbsp;through his movies to get rid of. I'm surprised he found so many he's willing to part with. I think that watching&nbsp;Clean Sweep has really motivated him. :D Hooray! &nbsp;Tonight I made up a few signs for it and I am hoping to get more done tonight before bed. So that we can post them around the streets. I really hope we sell all of our stuff. If not it's going to Goodwill or something. It's not coming back into this house! We are running out of room.   We had our car fixed this week. We finally have air conditioning again and HOPEFULLY after paying $772.00 our rear defrost is working again as well.&nbsp; Guess we won't know until it's cool enough to need it. Which should be pretty soon. Did you know it's only 5 months till Christmas! Tonight during dinner I asked Connor what he wants Santa to bring him. He says&nbsp; "hm" puts his finger on his chin and thinks really hard looking all serious. Finally he says.&nbsp; "A new lawnmower and that's it"&nbsp; I have never seen any child quite like him. Most three year old children get excited about the toy section in the store, or the candy isle. My three year old gets excited when we get to the hardware section of walmart, and he loves Canadian Tire stores he points them out to us when we drive by one.&nbsp;I thought he was going to explode when we took him to Home Hardware one time. When looking through the Sears Catalogue he flips quickly through the toys and straight to the BBQ's and the Lawnmowers. The drills and the tool boxes. Strange but such a little man.   &nbsp;

      Well according to  urlLink this &nbsp;it's not good. If you believe everything you read. I know I didn't watch that much tv as a kid (mainly because we lived in the country and only had three channels) so it must have been something else that made me smoke and be fat.

       I've just noticed that I haven't really posted anything all that interesting in quite some time. Maybe I've never really posted anything that you'd consider interesting... but anyways, like I said I'm not that intresting! Let's see. Um... nope can't think of anything. Oh well. Better luck next time. Oh speaking of luck. My mom went to bingo today and won me some money! :) We split our winnings so whether or not I go or she goes or not we still split. So I got $25.00 today Yay! To bad Adam took it to pay for his golf tournament coming up. Oh well. I'm glad to hear from some of our friends in Peterborough that they aren't flooded out. But luckily for them, they live in Ennismore&nbsp;and have drains in their basements!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I miss living in Peterborough. I lived there from the age of&nbsp;5 to&nbsp;11.&nbsp;

      It's cold outside. I thought it was summer but I think I have been fooled. It's currently 19 very cloudy and kinda raining. So I took a nice warm shower and got right back into some jammies.&nbsp; My&nbsp;baby girl is taking full advantage of this wonderful lazy day and only waking up to eat and see what's going on. Not looking like a sleepful night for mommy! Connor is busy watching tv and playing computer games. He's actually really bored but it's raining and his sister is sleeping so I can't even take him out to play in the rain. Oh well. The past few days have been a bit&nbsp;crazy. We've been busy gathering our things for our yard sale on the 24th. If I thought my house was messy before I was seriously wrong! On Monday I went to bingo didn't win though. I just needed to get out of the house for a bit. Then&nbsp;on Wednesday we were suppose to go&nbsp;visit our friends &nbsp; urlLink Cath &nbsp;and Mark but plans changed. So we went to visit Adam's mom and dad.&nbsp; Then we got to show off our lovely kids at Adam's mom's retirement party. That was actually kinda funny. They all knew who&nbsp;the kids&nbsp;were because they have watched them grow up in pictures right from the ultrasound photos. I'm sure they are all going to miss her very much.&nbsp; We are sure mom will enjoy her retirement greatly. She really does deserve it.  &nbsp; As I'm sitting here typing I'm noticing the new look of blogger. Hm interesting. &nbsp; You can change   the font to   which ever way   you prefer.   I really like that.   I awopqoirnv.kfqiuthgqwertyuio    I've never really understood those though. LOL.     &nbsp;  I like it. It's  fun.        &nbsp;   Anyways.... The flooding in Peterborough. I hope all our friends are okay. I've tried calling and haven't gotten an answer. If you are in Ptbo and are reading this please comment to let me know. I find it funny I only get comments from people I know use blogger.  I wonder if the other people I know that read this know they can comment too? Hm.         &nbsp;    Okay okay I'm bored. I'll stop rambling. But it is my blog and I can do really whatever I want!         &nbsp;    Like type really really big and yell out HELLO WORLD!          &nbsp;    okay that's it. I'm going to make dinner now.   Just incase you were wondering. Yes I know I am a geek.         &nbsp;    Bye!          &nbsp;       &nbsp;       &nbsp;

      Today has been a very busy day. I woke up at 8am, fed Megan and made my coffee. I can't start my day without my coffee. I took Megan and we went outside on the front porch. It was a beautiful morning, sunny and warm. We sat and waited for my cousins Kelly and Tracy to come. I had to put their hair up in updo's for a wedding. It was a beautiful day for a wedding. After the hair was all done, and so was my coffee. We decided to go out for a bit. We went to the Factory Outlet Mall here in the Falls in search for a hat for Connor. I don't know why it's pretty much impossible that we can't find a nice hat for him. A baseball cap. Plain or with some nice letters or something on it. He wears his Old Navy Trademark hat ALLLLL the time. It's so faded and worn out it's very much time for a new one. So we looked and we looked and we looked again. I even looked online and Old Navy only ships to the states. I know we'll find one it's just going to take time. Being picky takes time. I could always get him a dorky ugly kids hat from walmart. So bright red that I'd see him a mile away. But I thought no. So after the outlet mall we went to Walmart. Bought a few things that we needed along with two things we didn't really need. But we did get these new pull ups for Connor that when wet, he'll feel that he's wet. Pull ups I think were a big mistake in the potty training area. But we'll get there. It's just going to take time and patience. LOTS of Patience! After walmart we came home. We (Adam and I) started on our Yard Sale Stuff! HOORAY! We got ALOT done. It's amazing to see how much stuff we have hidden away that we never use. Like all of our old cassette tapes and books and toys and whatever else. It was hard though, to get rid of things that we've been holding on to since forever! And I know there are a few things we could have put in the sell pile, that we didn't. But oh well, keep it another five years and sell it at our next yard sale. lol. So we were busy sorting and finding deciding and tossing all of our things. As well as taking care of two cranky kids. It must be the weather or something, but they are so crabby lately. Megan just sits there and whines, and Connor too. It's very frustrating. Megan also had her very first taste of Rice Cereal. She did really good and seemed to like it too. Time goes by way to fast. I feel like just last week we're bringing her home and here it's time already for her to be starting foods! ie yie yie!

      I'm having a bad day. First I wake up way to early. Adam has to work all day so I'm here with these two cranky pants by myself. When the kids were finally quiet for a bit, I tried baking a chocolate cake. It fell apart, crubled into about 10 pieces. Then Megan pukes on me a good 12 times today, and she's so cranky. I seriously think she's teething. I hope not, I still plan on breastfeeding for another 4 and a half months at least! Connor refuses to go to the potty. And peed in his pants three times today. I've tried everything from bribing him with candies, stickers, popsicles, toys, hugs, kisses, funny dances around the room, punished him, put him in a time out in his room, explained to him a gazillion times nicely what to do, yelled at him, spanked him, praised him. I can't think of anything else to try. He just won't go. Yes he'll go if I bring him and force him but even then he sometimes still refuses. My house looks like a tornado hit it and I've even been trying to clean up along the way during the day. My back hurts, I feel gross from being puked on slobbered on, peed on. I want to go have a shower, put on my jammies and curl up in bed and read a book or watch a tv show that is not on treehouse that does not include Dora, Bear or any sort of rubber dubber. I want a big glass of milk and there is none to be found anywhere in the house and I can't take the kids to the store because Megan's in bed. Adam will be home in a half hour. I know he's worked all day but I need a break! My mom's gone to bingo I hope she wins me some money. That would brighten my day. Oh and being sorted into Griffindor helped a wee bit.

      We were having a good time, playing games and laughing and cheering when he got the pictures right on the match game. When his attention span wore out he went on his way to watch tv. Bear in the Big Blue house is on. I went to check on Megan who is sound asleep in the middle of the afternoon. When I come back and sit at the computer I hear Connor say to me. "Mommy, Grams is home." I say no she's not it's not past 7 yet. When it clicked. He did not say that from right here behind me. He was upstairs on the landing. So I go up to see what he's doing. CONNOR RILEY VRIESWYK are the only words that I hear screaming out of my mouth. As I see the purple marker all over the walls, the door, the windows, the television screen, . All I have to say is THANK GOD for washable markers! The only area it didn't come off was on the piece of plaster that has not yet been painted. Well I guess it has now! I put him in his room to punish him and what does he do? Yes you guessed it, found the last remaining marker and continued to write on his walls, toys and bed. ARGH!!!  The last time he did this about a week ago was with Bingo Dabbers. He created a lovely rainbow of colour on the kitchen wall upstairs. Bingo dabber does NOT come off. I scrubbed and scrubbed, finally I got the Mr. Clean Magic eraser out. It took off the bingo dabber as well as the PAINT! I sure hope my Nanny has some paint left over!

      When I heard this I was so thrown back. If you've ever been to Kings Bridge Park, you'll agree that there is no need to have to pay to park. I don't know what people think this city is. We're not Las Vegas, we're not Toronto, we are Niagara Falls. People come here because of the things we have to offer, but for not that much money. That's not going to happen any more. They keep building and building all these casino's, hotels, and other things and are going to be sorry when nobody wants to go to them because of the outragous prices.   My Aunt Sue has started a petition at her store because of this parking lot charge. Pretty sad when you get to park and ride to the casino for free, but if you want to enjoy a day out at a park with your faimly you have to pay $10.00 just to park.   Niagara Parks Commission is charging up to $10.00 to park at Kings Bridge (Chippawa) park, Queenston, and the School of Horticulture.  Susan says  "I was walking in the morning in Chippawa and stopped to talk with a worker for the parks.  He was very upset as well.  I know that our family at least uses the parks for picnics.  Well now you have to pay up to $10.00 per car and then you will have to pay to use the pavilions as well.  I am not one to complain when it is a fair thing but the parks commission doesn't pay taxes to our city!  All the money they make at the golf courses and restaurants, gift shops and stands are all done without any extra taxes.. they just collect GST and PST.. so why should we or the tourists be charged for parking!!!!  If you wish to come in our store to sign the petition please do so.  If you can't make it in please email me a note with stop parking fees in the subject line. I will get your emails and print them.  They along with the petition will be taken to Kim Craitor. He is willing to take them into parliament and fight the right people for us.  He is our MPP and he cannot even attend their meetings!!!!

      The other night I was woken up by the screaming of Connor. "Mommy" MOMMY! louder and louder, I run in to find him half asleep. "Mommy you dropped Megan" he says to me. "No I didn't hunny go back to sleep" I crawl into bed with him and assure him I did not drop his sister. She's sleeping Connor, you go back to sleep too. The sun isn't even up yet. This was 5:00am. Not even 12 mintues later, Adam comes in holding a hungry little Megan. Okay okay.... I'm up, I'm up. Megan is a morning baby! Not at all like her brother, mother or father who are all "night people".  Connor as a wee baby, would stay up till 11pm and sleep in till 11am. Not Megan. She's in bed by 7-7:30pm and up by 5:30-6:00am. But that's okay because I have learned that I'm a much happier mommy if I get to bed at least by 12am.   The other day we took the kids to the carnival. What a big waste of money carnivals are. But we had a great time. It cost us $30.00 to put Connor and I on the Big Ferris Wheel the whole time going up and down he's saying to me this is pretty neat mum!, The Big Berry Ride, not too sure about it at first but as the ride continued he finally says this is pretty neat. The kids train ride 3 times, with the look of bordem on his face and after the third time on almost falling alseep! The pony ride, pony named Sandy. Peed while Connor was on it.That was funny. Played a few games, won a few toys and then the best of them all Connor wanted to go on the Scrambler. "Mommy I want the fast cars". Okay I said, but it's really really fast. I know he says. So Daddy and Connor climb up into the little cart and I get into the other one. I don't know why but I worried about him the whole time the ride was on. I know Adam had him and he was fine and perfectly safe with him, but because he wasn't with me I just felt uneasy about the whole thing. Not to mention the ride goes so fast that I could barely keep my head up anymore let alone breathe literally! I was so relieved when the ride was over. Connor on the other hand, dropped his head in a pout and said he was sad the ride was over. The sun was a little much that day so we headed over to Boston Pizza for lunch. Then after that we took a trip to St.Catharines for a swim with Grandma and Grandpa. Connor loves his water wings and now can go into the pool without holding my hand. What a big boy he's becomming. Megan had her first experience in the pool. She cried. But oh so cute. I can't wait to see how the pictures of her in her little one piece bathing suit turns out.   So we haven't done too much in the past few days. Megan rolled over for the first time and laughed as well, that was pretty exciting for us. Connor built up enough bravery to attempt the pool all by himself so that was pretty neat. I won some money at bingo, and lost some too, Adam worked and played with the kids and things have been good. Except the fact that I hurt my back somehow. :( Oh well...

      The temperature outside has now hit 30 degrees celsius! However with the humidity it feels like 39 celisus, which is in fact 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit!! It's HOT! Too hot to even enjoy the day. But I'm not going to complain... it's finally summer!

      Megan's christening on Sunday was lovely, she was a good girl and didn't even cry when the priest poured the water over her head. I'll forget the fact that she spit up all over her pretty dress about 4 times and that the stink of her was so bad that I didn't even want to hold her. It was very hot in the church.  She was baptised in the same dress that I was baptised in, I thought that was pretty special. The party afterwards turned out nice. I think we had enough food and the weather was fine, considering it threatened to rain. I didn't get a chance to sit and chat with everyone like I wanted to though. Monday was a boring day did nothing. Tuesday I went to bingo with my mom didn't win. On Wednesday we had a guy come to talk to us about mortgages. We are able to get approved for $100,000 if we consolidate our loans and end up actually paying more then we can afford. So if we did that we'd have a house to live in but no food to eat or gas for our car, or money for the rest of our bills.  So It looks like we're stuck here for a long time longer. After he left we went to Adam's mom and dads... that was a nice time. We swam in the pool and had bbq ham. Connor's doing great swimming. He's only got his waterwings now and can swim all by himself. I'm really surprised at how well he's doing considering that was only his 4th time in the pool this summer! Wednesday night we went to see Spider Man 2, Adam the spider man fan that he is loved the movie. I enjoyed it as well. However I don't understand nor will I ever understand why young girls think it's cool to try and impress people by clapping loudly and screaming when people kiss cause they think it's sweet so loud so that it ruins the movie for other people. I was SO ready to tell her to shut up. But she was way down front. She's lucky for that. Today is Thursday I went to bingo and won a little bit of money. We came home had Pizza for dinner and I put the kids to bed. It's Canada Day! There are fireworks going off outside. Connor was looking forward to seeing them tonight... He was asleep before 9pm. Poor kid.  I'm thinking on Saturday we might go to the carnival!

      Well Connor got home safe and sound. Only a few minor bumps. That's boys for ya! He wasn't a good boy from what I hear though. Again... That's boys for ya!  Yesterday we went to visit Adam's mom and dad. They have been on vacation for about 3 weeks. It was too cold to go swimming so Connor got alot of playing done. Megan had a good time too and actually stayed awake most of the day!  Today is Dad's 58th birthday   HAPPY BIRTHDAY!           Today is also Adam's and my anniversary. 11 years together! who would've thought!          Last night we went to see  urlLink The Village  with Kenny and  urlLink Amanda . Through the whole movie I was like "what the heck?" Okay I jumped once * knew it was coming but jumped anyway* The rest of the time I was laughing! It was a good movie I guess. The scariest part about it was knowing that there are actually well.... you watch the movie and find out for yourself. :)

      Is it not August? I'm pretty sure that I have the correct date on my calander. August 5th... Right?  So why am I sitting here in my p.j's with a house coat on and a fleece blanket wrapped around me. My hands so cold that I could be wearing mittens. My feet so freezing that I can barely feel them anymore.  It's 17 degrees celsius which is 62.6 degrees Fahrenheit!   urlLink Here  is where I go to do the conversions. It's summer it should be 23 or 73 whatever way you look at it. Not 62! Brrrrrr  Someone turn up the heat!

       urlLink    It's a happy morning here in Jennifer's World. Even though mommy didn't get as much sleep as she needed. Just looking at those smiles makes it all worth while. I do miss Connor though :(  Although it is really scary how much Megan looks like her brother! &nbsp; urlLink

      I finally got to put some links on my site. Yay! Thanks for all your help everyone. I really suck at this! But I try and I guess that's better then nothing isn't it?  Now that that is taken care of here's what happened in Jennifer's World today....  I woke up at 4am drenched. Megan sleeps through the night now ( while she's not going through a growth spurt) so I have all this food for her and she's not eating it at night. So I get up eyes half shut and I make a bottle. I climb back into bed and hope for a few more hours of sleep. When I opened my eyes again it was 8:30am. That was nice. Megan's up and ready to eat.  I had to wake Connor up today at 9:30am. Lazy bum! Then we spent the morning playing and getting things ready. My Nanny took Connor camping today until Friday. I hope they have a good time. My cousin Brittany went along as well. I hope they don't fight too much. Then Adam and I took Megan to the doctor. Time for her second needle. She did really well for the first half hour. I don't know why it takes my doctor so flippin long to get to everyone. We get there at 2:36pm (our appointment if for 2:40pm) We sit in the crowded waiting room for a good 10-15 minutes. It's August it's hot in there and it's packed. Lovely. So we finally get to go in. We sit there for a good time again. The nurse comes in and weighs Megan. 15lbs 2oz yay Megan. She is now 61cm long and is doing great. Oh they grow so fast!  Then a Medical Student comes in. Asks a whole bunch of useless questions and then sits and chats with us for another good 10 minutes. Then finally the doctor comes in takes a quick look at the baby asks how everything is ( all of which I just told the student) she leaves and then the nurse comes back in to give the shot. My poor little girl. I hold her down while the nurse jabs this thing in her thigh and I look at her face as she cries cause it hurts. I quickly pick her up and hold her and the crying stops. Good girl! That's it we're done. Let's get the heck outta here! We get in the car and look at the clock 3:58pm! That was insane. Do they not here the baby crying, do they not care that she's hungry and was just stabbed in the leg with a painful fluid going through her? No I guess not. They'd rather make what could be a short and sweet visit into this long horrible one. Grrrr.  Megan went to bed at 7:30pm. Connor's not home... why am I still up?

      Okay that was close. The problem was the bunny post. See what I tried doing was signing up for blog rolling, and I am trying to put the peoples blogs I read on the sidebar. But when I did that everything went screwy. Thanks  urlLink Jenny  for reminding me about the "too big of a picture thing" I did that once before too. I noticed yours and  urlLink C.E's  looked different from mine. I'll try again.

      I don't particularily like Mondays. Tuesdays are okay I guess because I look forward to Wednesdays. Thursdays I don't like much either ( well except in the fall when Survivor & ER are on... :( no more Friends though :'(  Fridays are like Tuesdays for me, I look forward to Saturdays. Sundays are always nice.  Tomorrow Megan goes for her second needle. I'm nervous again. You'd think I'd be use to this by now having gone though it once already with Connor. But I think I'm more nervous because the last needle Megan got,she had a reaction of conjuntivitis from it. *thankfully* I knew what that was and what to do because Connor had it once. Having a second child is much easier I think.   Thanks Jenny... I'll see if I can figure it out.
