      Reminders for Kimberly:  Don't forget to apply Vaseline ON YOUR LIPS before you sleep.  Don't try to be a hero and use some cheap shampoo (FUCK YOU, SUNSILK) when you know it's going to fuck up your scalp and hair eventually.  Try to sleep at goddamn 2AM, Kim.  You are hopeless at configuring handphones. You are also hopeless, and I stress on hopeless, when it comes to ANYTHING technological and works with wires, cable and an electric socket.  You must floss daily. Don't let those braces be of any excuse. It's no excuse. And it doesn't matter if it takes x10 slower with all the maneuvers and what not, you just fucking do it.   Cut fingernails, please. You have started to hurt yourself unconsiously with them again. Your body does not want more self-multilaton.  Do NOT try to cut your fringe. You are growing it out.  You are not Bjoerk and you sure as hell don't look good nor cute in them.  Exercise 4x a week. How many times do I have to remind you!? And no, it doesn't mean if you exercise you can then binge on whatever food you like right after the workout! It does not work that way.  You are not invincible. Please remember that.  Fishes die. They eat the plants as well. Don't be upset. Just clean the damn tank and know that those deceased fishes are in a happier place.  Dogs are very cute. Cats too!  Please drink atleast 2 liters of water a day. Anything less than that will kill you!  And no, you cannot spend your money on CDs, Books or Smoothies. SAVE MONEY. And no using your ATM card.

      First of all, I'd like to say; Thank God you guys were only planning to have  coffee this coming 3rd July in La Bodega. I would have brought a sandwich if you guys were planning to have dinner there. I hope the coffees are not cut-throat price..no wait, of coz they are. Don't mind me and the thermos if I do come with one. And OoOO we get to dress up nicely for that day. *Claps* Now I have a reason to wear that formal top which I've kept in the cupboard for like a year.  Secondly; Paul is a master eater.   Thirdly; I must make it a point to sleep by 2AM.  and last but not least; Work out, bitch. Work out! Atleast 5 times a week!  Yup. Alright then. G'night, darlings.

      I have this gut feeling that no one reads this site anymore. I think after a month of having left it in shreds, people have stop bothering and have pretty much figured I was gone for good. Then again, you wouldn't really want to check up on anything which has been decaying for the past month.  So why the rebound and why did I come to my senses and start this blog again? Simple. I was having a down-fall. I was being itchy. I felt like something was on my back and I blamed everything around me for it. It was yet another battle against me and the voice within myself. It's ironic how we're truly our own worst enemies. Anyways, to cut the long story short; I wanted to expunge everything before and start on a clean sheet. But before I could do that or had inspiration to do so - I needed a sabbatical to convalesce.  And here I am. Back again.  But I feel like... there's really no one.  Oh well. I'd have to pray a few lost souls will drop by once in awhile and somehow fall under my charm spell which will convince them that I have the best blog in the whole internet realm. They will then go forth and spread the word about my rants, and recruit more people who will also fall for my charm. At the end of the month, I should have an army of loyal devotees all under my control. I shall then make them go forth and oogle more people and force them through to my page, and they do will be hynotized and the cycle will continue until I have everybody checking up on my site, daily, 24 hours aday, every minute and every second. I SHALL BE THE BLOGGING DIVINE MISTRESS!  BOW TO MEEEE!!  Okay. I got off-hand there. I'm nice. Really. Very very nice. Ask everyone. And I'm not an attention seeker or anyone of those things. It's all for the good of me, myself and I. My writings are for personal references. :D HONEST!  My mouth hurts. I have purple teeth. I have a huge ulcer and the brackets jab into it everytime I move my lips to the right.  This is NOT cool.

      Goddamn Swedes. I hate Van Nistelrooy even more now. @$@%$#^ $&%^*&% SO angry!   Does anyone notice how when we break up we have urges to give back everything that was given to us by our exes? Funny how that goes isn't it?  Technically we should be basking with the memories that we once had. But instead, we just wanna expunge everything that once had to do with that person.  So we do get rid of everything a) We give them back everything they've given us,  b) If they don't accept it, we chuck it out  c) We throw everything in a box and hide it deep in our storerooms or under our beds.  But once the anger has subsided and once the feelings have found a steady flux, we finally realize how much emotional baggage all those things had in them. We get nostalgic over thinking about them. We lurk in the past and re-live the happy times. We wish we had everything in our hands again.  And then, there are times you just never ever wanna see that particular item ever again. Not because it'd make you sad; but just because it'd make you sick and think about the relationship which you once had which was built on a platform of lies.  Can we throw out a rosary? ARGH.

      People are amazing. Really they are.  It's so hard to read them. So hard to understand them. Yet sometimes it's all so easy. It's always to the extremes when it comes to people. There is no objective answer to how we are like or how we're meant to be or how we really are. Everything's so colorful that, I have a great feeling that the study of psychology, which has tried so hard to get us under an objective description, have secretly given up and labelled all of us under the file, "IMPOSSIBLE".  But yet, like I've started before - we're so easy to understand. So easily unravelled. So obvious. Plain black and white.   I've thought alot of all the people I have met.  And whether I like to admit it or not - everyone of them has mould me into who I am today. My thinkings, my emotions, my ways and my antics. Everything about me is actually little pieces of everybody stuck together. And it's as simple as that.  I've met amazing people.  People who have given me such a huge mark on my heart I doubt I'll ever forget or stop thinking about what they have said or done when something sparks up a memory. I've met people who are like passing wind. Just a temporary satiety. Something so short and yet dropped with happiness. But yet, it was temporary. These people are forgotten. I've met people who are just in a world of their own. May it be people drenched in pure immaturity, pure jealousy, pure immaturity or pure weakness, they're usually the ones which have a huge impact on my thoughts. And I feel sorry for people who are stuck in their cruel worlds. I'm hoping one day they'll step out the box and realize that there's more to everything they wish and dream off. Shallowness does not lead you to anything but down.  But I don't know. People are who they want and wish to be. At the end of the day, it is you who takes those pieces and fix it and make yourself, sprinkled with a little bit of individuality. It really depends how well you sort of the pieces and sprinkle yourself. Some people cover everything perfectly. Others run out of sprinkle-me dust and just end up with patches. Others don't have nice color pieces and end up with old, broken and rugged ones whilst others get everything beautiful but yet lose their sprinkle-me dust.  It's really these little things that make us..well, US. And I wish people took it seriously. I've noticed people have been back-slidding.  I've always thought that as I age, I'd meet more reasonable people. But, it's been the same. I guess it was always a fake picture, thinking that the color sun glass would take a diffent light be in a different set of shade of colors. Things never do change. People, regardless of their ages, still are the people they once worked themselves up to be when they were 12. And it's a sad story, it really is.  You have people who like to make other people feel good. You have people who give their support in everything you do. You have people who are cynics. You have people whose only aim in life is to make everyone better than them feel like shit so they'd be king of the world. You have people whose only priority is ME, MYSELF and I. And you have people who are swimming in the sea of oblivion.  Which one do we plan to be?

      Justify, as if it were our right to say Now decide, which liar you trust and which one chose our fate  Fed in time as a choice we think we’re making It’s the guns that we know vs. the guns we never will  When illusions burn where will we be left standing  Still with the guns that we know vs. the guns we never will   Pacify, with false hope of safety within  Never mind that they were never there where could we begin   We call upon God for which killing’s permitted And then brag out loud that our side made the grade  We better pray, with this as our position  Our wrongs don’t come back and burn us down to the ground   And what gives us the right to judge without reprisal  To strike retaliation and wash our hands of blood  And who gave us the crown to claim that we’re divine  Without needing repentance and drive them into hell

      I'm sick. My nose is running and I have a sore throat.  I had nasi lemak today. I'm usually not a fan, but todays one was exceptional. This Chinese lady makes it and it's so good.   3 seeds of Durian, 10 m&ms, 2 blocks of Cadbury's Milk Chocolate and 2 Digestive biscuits all in a span of 15 minutes or less.  It's been 2 hours since. I feel incredibly woozy.  Snot runneth my cup over.

      I hate it when words are constantly replayed in our heads. It happens once in awhile. Simple quotes, poetry or lyrics are simply imprinted in our brains and the words are replayed again and again in our minds whether consciously or unconsciously.  For a whole week, everytime I've finally found some peace and quiet, Atreyu's song starts playing in my head. The lyrics thumping and the vocals, strained and screaming, echoes. Over and over.  "Look how pretty she is when she falls down And there's no beauty in bleeding mascara Lips are quivering like a whitering rose She's back again."  I wonder what it all means. Hopefully it fades away soon. I'm starting to get rather annoyed. Not that it's not a good song, because it really IS a good song but mainly because it's just starting to be rather .... naggish.  ANYWAYS, Paul's parents are back. He has no car thanks to the stupid trailer who decided to squash it like how we would crush a Coke can before recycling it. I am pretty much stuck at home as no one wants to teach me how to drive and I'm too lazy to go for the Undang thingamajig and the fact that I can only legally take my license in November.  Any functions happening over the next 2 months I'd probably have to skip unless someone's kind enough to drive all the way to Subang pick me up and send me home by 1AM, latest.  I did some shopping yesterday. Instead of buying Seamonkeys, I ended up with two wifebeaters and .. a silly belt. I misread the price and paid more than I was willing to. :(  I have to make cheesecake today.

      My Chemical Romance My Chemical Romance my Chemical Romance My Chemical Romance   Narh. I didn't think I was making sense either. Let's just say I'm looking for some CDs and just can't find them and am currently contemplating on whether to  a) Get it online? b) Get someone to buy it for me? c) Con people to buy it for me? d) Try to forget about it and use the money to buy a bunch of seamonkeys.  It's no wonder I've realized the increase amounts of white strands of hair in my head.   With these kinda decisions to fumble about on a daily basis; It's no wonder why we're all aging faster than we're suppose to, dying of heart attacks, suffering from anxiety attacks and quite frankly being lifeless limps by the time we hit 40.  Oh shit. I needed to get Bjork's Mendula as well.  Dammit. That's like 6 fucking CDs on the 'TO BUY' list. And I've not even bothered looking at the books "TO BUY" list.  I need a new handbag too. And some new pair of really cool Gravis sneakers.  Stress, stress, stress.  PS: I had my braces tightened yesterday. I may sound like I'm exaggerating but I assure you that I am not; THE PAIN IS JUST SUICIDAL. :( *Think Ashley Judd's teeth, Think Ashley Judd's teeth, Think ASHLEY JUDD'S TEETH*

      Right on.  No internet for 2 fucking days. I was about to kill myself from the ridiculous amount of boredom around me.   I've lost my will to spend money. I think Malaysia has crappy things. That or I've really lost the will to splash my money and I've become insanely stingy with my money.  I think I'll save money and go get my Bjork's Livebox CD collection. Seems like the only thing worth getting. Should I get the big black box or should I get them individual CDs? Hmm. Same price at the end of the day. Then again, I should just save the money and get her new album with the whole limited edition poster thingamajig. I wonder if it'll come out. :/  Paul's birthday was great. Loads of laughs and minimalistic food and free flow of bread and very very expensive mineral water.   Alot of people *cough* UNDERPAID *cough* but it was nice to see everyone around. Just remember people, SERVICE TAX and GOVERMENT TAX.

      Yeah. So the concert. How it went you wonder? Great? Fantastic? The bands were awesome?  Well, I made my way to Salomah. I was bitching and whinning throughout the journey because it was getting late and I'm Miss Punctual.  I arrived 20 minutes before 2. There was no one around Salomah theatre. I was skeptical. I asked around - everyone was wondering what the fuck I was talking about.   There was no show there. There was nothing there. It was so fucking empty.   They changed the venue. To Bukit Bintang. I didn't go.  I couldn't go. It was too late.  I had the official flyer. It stated INDIE ROCK FEST :: SALOMAH THEATRE :: 24th JULY 2004 :: RM 15. At 3PM, frustrated, depleted and goddamn smashed, I checked KLUE's website. It was being held in Bukit Bintang instead. Some Soul Star Lounge or some bullshit like that. RM 25.  The only thing same was the goddamn time. 2PM.  So fucking stupid. So so fucking stupid. Stupid Organizers. Stupid Venues.   All hopes lost like that.

      It's 4AM. I need to be up at 10AM.  Jalan Ampang for me tomorrow. To catch the awesome, awesome line up of  Whence He Came ,  Buddhiston ,  Tiramisu ,  Spiral Kinetic Circus ,  Empress Empire ,  Elisebelle Tears  and  Afternoon Tea .  I'll just keep my fingers crossed and hope everything will go well and the show will be as fantastic as the very promising line-up. That and no perverts grapping my ass and trying to be funny.  After the show, It'd be back to Paul's place to get ready for his birthday dinner.  I'll see those of you who are coming there and try not to be late.

      There is no control over what we feel and when we feel it. We just take it with open (or not so open) hands and deal with it. No questions should be asked. There are no answers. Just keep a firm grip of what you're handed with and be at peace with yourself, and simply figure it out. Slowly. There should be no hurry.   I met up with a fellow Live-Journal'er' today. She came down from Germany. She brought her boyfriend. She's from Sabah but she migrated to Germany 6 years ago. Her boyfriend's as german as they get, except he doesn't drink Beer. They don't know how to use the chopstick. They were such a sweet pair. They also think our malls are insanely humongos. I'll have to agree with them on that.   Our government tends to put all our money into shopping for some reason. Don't know what good that'd would do to the economy. We never really had smart people running the country anyways - this is all expected.   Ladies,  WE shouldn't complain about how expensive a Levi's jeans is here. When Elfie saw the Levi's here, she yelp joy praises.  "Only RM200," she chimes. She gets one on the spot.  "In Germany, it's almost 100 Euros a pair of Levi's jeans."   That's fucking 480 bucks per jeans!!!!!!!!!  For a pair of LEVI's!&nbsp;Well, shouldn't be a suprise since Aussie sells them for equally that amount or more. I don't know why I get this perception that things are somewhat cheaper where the currency is bigger. &nbsp;Except I have a feeling things are really much cheaper in the US of A. But that country fucking sucks. It has everything and anything I want. I'm in a current boycott against it. Fucking USA and all its privilleges.  The point is: 100Euro for a pair of jeans is insane. And 300+AUD for a pair of Von Dutch jeans is insane and 60Euro for a VonDutch trucker cap is suicidal. WHY ARE CLOTHES GETTING EXPENSIVE? CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EASE MY MIND AND TELL ME WHYYYYY?  Anyways, we took them to Ming Tien after that. We figured you cannot get any more Malaysian with the food cruisine then in Ming Tien. Honestly, I think Elfie and Flo were just plain scared of the place. I don't blame them. Our comrade, Mr. Aaron, was drunk next door. Quite a spectacle if you must know. He forgot Paul's name right after he said it less than 1/2 an hour ago. Alcohol has suchhhh an effect on people. It is another one of life's great mysteries.   Tomorrow, I'll have dinner with my cousin from Pakistan. I'll have to. The last time she came, I somehow managed to forget to meet up with her and received many threatening phone calls after that about the consequences of FFK-ing her. I'm pretty much threatened. I should go. She is family.  I hope they don't decide on clubbing or something.  Mom said I should just stay over with them; have a slumber party or something. I don't want to. I'll have the show the next day, the one in Jalan Ampang and then Paul's birthday dinner. Mom insisted.  I told dad they were going to take me clubbing. He phorbits the slumber party and will come get me, anyways - anyhow, from 1Utama to save me from the gastly sights of people dancing, getting high and very loud electronical idiotic-same-rhythm-unoriginal music.  I love my Dad.   I'll have to bleach my upper lip hair tomorrow as well. Oh the joy.

      Does anyone notice how unusually fast time has been passing lately?   It's almost the end of the week once again. July flew by faster that I thought imaginable. So many dates, and goals and things that I thought I would have during the month, I have not yet come to do. All I have done was simply push back all the plans and crammed it to the last 10 days of the month and am now facing the consequences of being a lazybum.   Stuck in a tornado field at the moment. My mind spins in all directions, picking up everything around me and being my own big plasma membrane - taking in what I need and pushing out what I don't need. Only thing is, my cell's plasma membrane actually knows what it's doing. I have no idea whatsoever. All the taking in and excreting have no connection, no use, no facts. I'm just doing what I feel is right. And that's usually never good as I'm 99.9% of the time dead-flat wrong.   I go around feeding myself fallacies I've created on my own.  "Kim, you're fine."  "Kim, you've got this under control."  "Kim, you'll be okay. Things will calm down."  It's such a paradox when you lie to yourself. You know it's all lies, but yet you feel better.&nbsp; I'll never understand our emotions, ever. I don't think anyone will in general anyways.   And I guess I've been just wallowing here, by myself. Slowly, but surely in my own melee. Nothing to mewl about, nothing aberrant. I could ask for succour but it'd just be a waste of time, and the persons time. It's just one of those phases we get through. The kind we go through atleast 2438473 times a year - only difference is we all take it differently. I, as we can all tell, don't take it as winsome as I should. I choose to be weak and just drown in my melange of complication, depression and anxiety.   I'll snap out of it eventually.  Hopefully anyways.  It's been a good month. Not so good with the rush and everything - but nothing I can complain about.&nbsp; It was rather mild but somehow rather ... disturbing. I'll never understand these things. I'll never know how to explain it either.   Maybe I'm right about the phase. About the lonely phase we often get. Everythings so loud, everyone's pretty much everywhere; yet you're in a glass bubble. You're alone and you're unheard.   THAT or I'm listening to too many angsty, lost, and sad music.&nbsp;

      I've been watching "America's Next Top Model."   I have now develope a even stronger hate towards women who are taller than me and weigh less than me.   So, every night I go to sleep praying that when I wake up the next day, I'll be 10 inches taller.  My prayers are still in pending. Because he is God, and he is the Almighty - I'm giving him a week to answer my prayers and perform the miracle of legs lenghtening. If he doesn't reply, I'm going to lose all faith and the next time I sign up for anything I'm going to place DISABILITY and consider myself a midget.  After all, that is sort of a handicap, right? I mean, dwarfs aren't exactly normal, yeah? I'd probably get some advantages anyways.   I mean, I swear I have everything.  I don't have small feet.  I can easily fit into a size 25 (The maximum size is 26).  I could pose (Okay, maybe not that naturally - but nothing abit of chemical substance can't help).  I could so do the catwalk.  I could be posh (with the help of a few etiquette lessons).  And I can so be PERSONALITY.   ONLY THING STOPPING ME:   MY FUCKING LEGS.   Okay. And my ass la. I mean, my ass could get smaller la, and perhaps tighter abs..and a new nose and an eyelift.&nbsp;   It just isn't fair.&nbsp; Not fair, not fair, not fair. You aren't suppose to go scrolling around on the beach being perfect. There has to be this distinct flaw. Perfection is something which can never be grasp. Bleh. But that statement has been proven wrong. So wrong.  &nbsp;  I bet they have smell armpits or something. I hope they do anyways. And a big boil behind their necks or something. GRR.   I'm just sad I have no hope whatsoever of being a model and modelling for chanel or something. *sniff*  &nbsp;  PS: I think I've been watching too much telly and reading too many magazines. Brainwashing.

       People hardly ever take time to read lyrics.     "  I never said I'd lie and wait forever  If I did we'd be together  I can't always just forget her  But she could try   At the end of the world  Or the last thing I see  You are never coming home  never coming home  Can I  Should I  And all the things that you never ever told me  And all the smiles that are ever , ever...   Get the feeling that you'll never  All alone and I remember now  At the top of my lungs in my arms she dies  She dies   At the end of the world  Or the last thing I see  You are never coming home  Never coming home  Can I  Should I  And all the things that you never ever told me  And all that smiles that are ever gonna haunt me  Never coming home  Can I       Should I      And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me  For all the ghost that are never gonna catch me   If I fall  If I fall...      "    I think they should start.

      Pop music and its addictiveness. How the music tends to stick in your head and how you suddenly find yourself singing along when it's blasted on the radio unconsciously. How when you're alone you find yourself humming the tune. How it's amazing within 2 measly day you've managed to memorize the entire lyrics.  And how you download it and listen to it over and over again at 1am in the morning only because you don't listen to the radio and you have no other way of listening to it without having the evidence on you. So you download it anyways, but you keep hush about it and everytime someone turns to you and questions you about how much you like that song, you grimace and say "YUCK!" only because you're kiasu and you cannot be caught chimming and enjoying mediocre mass produced artificial music.  Deep down, you know you fucking just love the song. And your boyfriend knows it too, coz you've downloaded it on his computer when he went out to wash the car. As soon as he comes back you switch to something 'more' you.  "Fall, sometimes I fall so fast When I hit that bottom crash You're all I have  Oohhh It seems like I can finally Rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Oohhhh it's as if you know me better Than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me."  It's been an hour on repeat.  I can now sing the song out loud, minus the music perfectly. WOOT!

      I'm in love with this Hong Kong band.   I mean, at first when I first heard one of their songs, I pretty much thought it was another American band which played good music. I was enthralled and completely psyched about it.  I should have remembered Fred telling me about this chinese band which plays really good music - but as usual, I let it slip and completely forgot about it. He told me to go to their site and check out their demo songs. The site somehow didn't seem to play music and I just ignored their existence and carried on with my naive music mp3 files and just applied to being contented.  He passes me a song when I was up to my head going insane. It was the time where the 3 computers decided to die on me and I was so close to dying along with them. The same day, Spanky my laptop, decided to work again after Dr. Paul took a look and reformatted it. I came online and Fred, being my FaZAa as I call him, passed me this brilliant untitled song.   I listened to the whole 3 minutes of it, repeatedly. I was so amazed by the sounds and the vocals. The beautifully captivated melody. Like a cross between something Mogwai would play and a indie slow rock lament. It was such a beautiful song.  "Finer Lights and Fairytales." The title of the song says it all.  I asked him about the band and where did they hail from and all that other 411 you'd usually ask about a band. He replied hastily saying "I told you it was the Hong Kong band. Didn't you check out the website?!" I sat down with my mouth open. "OMG CHINESE BOYS CAN SING" was all I could reply. For the next 5 minutes, I kept on asking him were they really from Hong Kong. The poor German guy had to keep reassuring me they were and why was I so shocked about it. I passed it to Michelle, and told her they were 4 hongkies. She was pretty much impressed as hell and Michelle is such a non-rocker loud chick - being as beautiful as she is, she listens to beautiful jazz and slow songs which is the perfect music epitome for her dainty nature. But the point was, SHE was as impressed as I was.  I found some good Japanese bands. Well, rather - Fred sent me some really good Japanese bands as well. It's amazing you can't tell the next asian boy to a white boy. Kudos boys of Asia. I know I'm leaning against the RACIST side by saying "OMG - ASIAN BOYS CAN SING MINUS THE CINAPEK ACCENT" and all that and perhaps I've just always held on to the perception that "You'd know they're asian when you hear them by their pronunciation and the way they work their music and sing". I've never been so wrong.    OKAY. My point has been all jumbled up; Let me try to rephrase myself.   Whence He Came  is playing on the 24th in Jalan Ampang along some other really good bands. I've never been so excited in my life. Paul's a sweetheart because it IS his birthday and I should spend the day with him but I've been pestering about the fact the band was suppose to do a show here and in Singapore for so long (even telling him if they perform only in Singapore - we'll DRIVE down and DRIVE back up before my CURFEW chimes) that he's pretty much passive about my enthusiasm and gave me a green light to go "enjoy myself."  *Dances* I'll smell like an ashtray at the end of the day. But OMG! WHC IS HERE AND IM GOING IM GOING IM GOING IM GOING!  PS: You people have no idea what the fuck I'm rambling about, isn't it? I didn't think so either. Just ignore this post. I had to just gloat about it for if I didn't, I was worried my head would explode.

       urlLink Ben  kata kita patut menulis dalam bahasa melayu hari ini. Saya tahu saya sudah menulis satu karangan tentang MILO tadi, tapi skrang pukul empat pagi dan saya sangat bosan.  Anda perasan tak dalam Malaysia kita tidak berinteraksi mengunakan bahasa melayu semasa melepak. Kita semua mengunakan bahasa ingerris. Adakah kita patut begitu? Di negara German, semua orang cakap german semasa melepak and di negara Jepun jugak sama. Kenapa kita lain and sering mengunakan bahasa ingerris sahaja?  Memang hairan. Tapi saya fikir becakap dalam bahasa ingerris ini lebih senang.   Paul ada futsal. Dia tu main setiap hari Khamis. Tapi dia tu lemah and selepas lima minit berjoggin, walaupun dia akan kata dia berlari, dia akan jadi sangat penat dan untuk satu jam yang seterusnya - dia akan jalan jalan macam kita pegi membeli belah atas padang futsal itu. Satu hari saya akan pegi tengok dia bermain bola sepak. Kerana saya teman perempuan dia dan saya kena menyokong keyakinannya. Saya sangat sayang pada dia.  Saya akan cuba mengulangkaji pelajaran saya juga hari ini. Banyak Matematik saya kena habiskan. Banyak susah tau. Sains pulak gila susah. Macam mana saya nak habiskan semua buku, iaitu lapan buku, sebelum habis bulan saya pun tak tau. Saya kena lebih berdedikasi and tekun.   Okay la. Saya sudah tak tahu apa nak ceritakan kepada anda semua. Saya banyak letih dan kena banggun kat pukul sembilan pagi. Saya ini, setiap hair, semakin hodoh and mata saya satu hair akan keluar kerana tak cukup tidor. Ada bulat hitam semua dah.  Jaga diri, baik baik semua tau. Esok dah Jumaat dah. Saya suka kat hari Jumaat.

      If there's one thing that puzzles me, it's the things people make you buy for them when you're overseas.  If you're in Australia and on your way back, you get them to get you candy, biscuits, milo, sauces, shoes, clothes ecetera ecetera.  If you're in Malaysia on your way to Australia, they ask you to get them candy, biscuits, milo, sauces, shoes, clothes ecetera ecetera.  God knows what kinda cycle this is but it's straight up weird.  The one thing, everytime we go to Australia, people make us get MILO. And last time I checked, Australia has milo. Infact, Australia has so many other manufacturers of chocolate powder it's insane to ask someone to bring them MILO. Heck, they even HAVE MILO there and don't give me the bullshit about how it taste different and all that because if it does, add more and perhaps use MILK instead of water and bombard the cup with sugar.  People leave wanting a new life. A new experience. Yet they hoggle everything in the past with them.   It's really just ironic.

      I really don't like girls who have nice hair and look ridiculously good in pictures. It's unfair and it's just not human to have such great hair, great skin and great teeth. And they say God made everyone equal? Last I checked, 99% of the time I look like shit in pictures. It's always either my eyes are closed, my eyes are half opened, I have a goofy grin, my eyebags are so obvious it could shallow my face or I have this completely stupid grin on my face. And if it's not all that, on the specific day I need to take a photo, I'll have this huge-size-of-China pimple on a specific area on my t-zone.  It's purely bad luck. And I swear the camera is bias.  Having 6 seeds of durian and working out less than half an hour later is just point blank stupid. I have never felt this woozy before. I have constant urges to just throw up all over the place and the stench of durian is just everywhere I go. I wonder if it's just me or there's a faint smell of the leftover durian scent lingering in the house. My fingers are quite frankly the worst thing to sniff at the moment. Someone should remind me to use the spoon next time.  I should shower.  I smell of Malaysian Durian and dried up sweat.

      New fresh empty reformatted same old computer.  Greg has been brainwashed and he's a tiny bit faster than he used to be. He's absorbing all the new stuff and he's being well-manned besides the fact he's not in good terms with Norton. But IT'S OKAY - nothing that didn't have an alternate route.  Now to just fill him back with MP3s and some new songs. And to pray that he doesn't fuck up again.   Technology and me. Me and Technology.  It's like peanut butter with White Curry.

      Sow, Ben, Lynn, Paul, and I (and Zing as he came much much later) had a heated discussion on sex in all its glory just now.  I've come to a conclusion that, whatever it is and no matter how many fucked up weird things may pile upon the direction of how to have sex; I shall forever remain faithful to the missionary position in bed with a guy. Forever and ever and ever.  Anythingelse will not go. EVER.   Paul will be having his 20 candles lit soon. We're not quite sure where to go just yet. You're all invited of coz. Shouldn't be many who would attend since like only 6 people read this blog, but anyways; We came up with 2 choices.  A) Fragipani - We'll dress up real sleek and all sexy and stuff (Boys included) and we'll just see which boy gets hit on by another guy first. Or maybe which girl gets hit on first.  and  B) KTV lounge. Paul really wants this though, but none of us have found dignity to release our voices publicly into a mic infront of everyone but HIM. Turns out, Wookookoo likes to sing too! Or so we've heard, so that's just made Paul want to do it more since now he has a found 'kaki.' But we're really not sure.  Suggestions, perhaps?

      Hello all. This is Kim reporting once again. Forgive the last post. My boyfriend knows not what he do and I've failed to inject him with his medications. Unfortunately, we ran out of stringes and trying to contain him, without the trcyclic, is quite impossible because he is big and strong and I am just too lazy too bother. Plus, my mom just threw out the rotan the other day.  Did anyone understand the frog story he wrote about though!?  He might appear once in awhile. We'll forgive him for his rants. *Nods solemnly* We shall, we shall.  xxx Right, back on track with my ever involving exciting updates:  My computer is kaputt AGAIN for the 486233842634273542634572345th time. Brilliant. Technology and me. We have such a nice history together. I get all 'nostalgic' thinking about it. Can you feed electronics poison? Something which will slowly kill it whilst make it suffer in great agony? Pour water over it, you say? That's just being too nice. I'll think of something soon.  Besides that,  Fishes are dirty creatures. Robbie Williams is my sex fantasy. Matthew Perry and Dylan McDermott have beautiful eyes. I have my period. I want to get out of the country. SOMEONE PLEASE FUCKING BUY ME SOME FREOSMOOTHIES. I'm reading a John Irving book (I wonder how did that happen). Mom wants me to look for scholarships. I need a new phone color; something red would be nice.  Leanne is impossible to live with. I've started collecting 1cent coins. I need new CDs. My mother owes me a book. I have a bamboo plant next to me. I've finished all the coconut and durian dodol and I need more of it. I've decided that the oven is my new best friend and rose syrup is the #1 cordial in the world.   I've not been to Starbucks in ages (explains why I actually have some notes in my wallet - could be maybe it's just the starting of the month or something..). My aunt sent back 2 new collared shirts from Australia; I'm forever grateful for that as I'm desperately in need of new clothings - any form of new clothings. I have period cramps. I've discovered my teeth have moved and now I have more than 4 gaps.   I crave banana leaf. And I like milk.  I will be vegan one day. You bad people should stop eating the cows! I need someone to wax my legs. I might have to stop myself from eating too much cheese. I must have put on atleast 3 pounds.  I MUST SLEEP MORE!  Okay. I go read now. Byebye, my lovelies.

      My goggle toolbar in in German. I figure it might help me sort some german vocabs out. I just find it amusing everytime an intruction comes out and that its all in gibberish. Usually I start getting panicky, thinking some bug has got into my computer and changes the English language to tribe-geeky language; only to remember I downloaded the damn thing in German. I then bravefully proceed to attempt to translate the german words and try real hard to understand the intructions without refering to a translator.  But of course, anyone is capable of doing this as the google toolbar isn't exactly for rocket-scientist IQ capacity only. And it wasn't like I never had it in English before.  But that's besides the point!  I feel proud. And it's a goddamn start. Sooner or later, I'd be reading and understanding TV manuals in german and we'll see who has the last laugh then. Suckers! And then when I finally began to start reciting Goethe in his mother-tongue and have a masters in Deutsch, you all shall see how powerful the german google taskbar was and how much of an impact it had on my life. YEAH!   I overdid it with dinner to night. 3 hours of stuffing your face with steamboat cannot have good side-effects in the diet zone. And the fact that I've decided I don't need to work-out this week because I did it everyday last week is just not good either. Why doesn't it get to my head that this exercise thing is a long-term routine and not some one night fling? I have no idea.  Maybe when I hitch up a size - it might finally slap me in the face and I'll FINALLY stop reaching for the damn junk food and my chocolate bars and those damn Uncle Toby's cookie and cream granola bars. These things are evil.  Tomorrow I'll make miniature red horns and stick them on all the junk food in the house as a reminder. That should scare me off abit. After that, I shall stick a naked picture of Angelina Jolie as my sole-motivator for my exercise regime 128734292374th attempt and hopefully this time, it will be sucessful. Exercise God, gimme strength! Gimme the strength you've blessed, Big(Moderate)Ben. Please please please.   It's 12:15 and I'm looking for a printable size picture of the Borneo Island because I am my sister's project/printer person for her schoolwork. It's not as easy as it seems. And it's a waste of time. But I rather work my baby Greg then let her have her hands on my baby. She screws him up so badly and leaves him sore. She's awful.  After this, I shall lounge around and await the very much anticipated Euro2004 finals. I have no idea who's going to win and I'm not on anyone's side (though I should be rooting for Portugal) - but I guess that's what makes it all the bit more exciting. Let's hope its a super duper match. With penalties! because penalties rule! AND some shirt exchanges in the end. TOPLESS FOOTBALLER MACHO MEN!! yum yum!

      I find this clip so cute :)     urlLink Madame Lynnzter  and Paul.   And no, nobody got naked. Well, I'm not sure what happened after I left though - but whilst I was there, there were no private parts exposed. There were inquiries about when the strip-teases were going to happen and loads of fingers were pointed towared  urlLink Cheng Leong  and  urlLink Kevin  but they somehow managed to brush the declarations and were fully equiped with clothes.  BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. I was hoping to see some naked men. BOOOOOOOOOOOOO.         It's evident that only  urlLink Sui Lin  is capable of organizing big events. It's all so natural to her to do these things. Her PR-ship is excellent and she makes everyone comfortable and remembers everyones name. None of us would have ran the damn thing smoothly. None of us would have attracted THAT much people.                It was packed. Not as packed as Bar Savanh, but packed enough. Expensive drinks, nibbles here and there, board games and a whole lot of fun and laughters. I had a amazing time with all of them at table #1. :D It was great being with all you guys in the table. :D The chemistry was good and we'll make a good pack of noisy, drinking nutters. :D       MAN OF THE PARTY(IES) : The ever SOW:MASTER OF EVIL. Without him, there's no fucking party. And sorry to those who wanted the title - but there's just no beating me  urlLink Sow . The world WILL be such a bitter and mundane place without him.   PS: I know the pictures are just weird, but you're bound to find actual people staring and posing pictures on all the other sites. I took advantage of being the arty, abstract photos to post up. :D PSS: We should have more gatherings like this. But I reckoned the novelty wouldn't be as ... 'SYIOK' as it would be if this kinda thing was held every 6 months one. But oh well. It was good fun though... :)

       I just realized tomorrow's that La Bodega thing (I have memory lapses) -  I just realized I have nothing to wear.   Shit shit shit shit shit.   I don't care how vain that sounded but I believe I'm female and I'm entitled to whine and combust about my wardrobe and vanity misdemenors and complications.  Yellow top? Red perhaps?  Jeans? Pinstripe pants? Can I wear sneakers?   IS THIS PLACE OVER 18 ONLY!?!  Bleh.    EDIT:  Hmmm. I think I've been to comfy wearing the same old things all the time that it's reached a place where I forget there are other clothes besides Jeans and Shirts. It's just such a burden to find something decent to wear somehow. Well, I'm sure all you girls are there have tons of clothes and what not since y'all so nicely clad all the time - but as for me, I'm ... through a .. phase with my wardrobe. So I think everything sucks. And quite frankly, everything sucks. Everythings wrong, doesn't fit and has a strange color. HMMPH.

       Open your music player select all the tracks in your library and play them on shuffle, post the first 10 that play no matter how embarassing:   1 Mika Nakashima's Find The Way 2 Placebo's This Picture 3 Atreyu's Dilated 4 Underoath's Young And Aspiring 5 Lindsay Lohan's Ultimate You 6 Muse's Ruled by Secrecy 7 Heather Nova's Papercup 8 Skulker's Going Home 9 Blindside's Thought Like Flames 10 Yvonne Catterfeld's Abendstern   Okay now, Let us explain the whole 'BAD SHAMPOO' tragedy:  It was going fine. Really, it was.  I was trying to economic. I had the SAVE MY PARENTS MONEY plastered on my forehead.  I figure I might as well give these simple shampoos another chance since they've improved over the years and somehow managed to have good propaganda and assure you your hair will look like Portia's in Ally McBeal.  They have never worked on my hair. And now I'm damn sure that they will never ever work.  I didn't sleep the whole night. My scalp was itching like mad. I was so angry wondering what I did wrong. I mean, I started off the shampoo a week ago and it was fine - what the hell went wrong? Did I leave shampoo in perhaps? Unlikely, I rinse my hair like mad. Did I use the wrong thing? Can't be. There's only one bottle of shampoo in the bathroom. Sratch sratch sratch. Itchy. Itchy. Itchy. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. *pulls hair* And the fact that split ends were all over the place didn't help. Dry, itchy and just bushy. :(  Paul called at 5AM. I told him I need new shampoo.  He came at 11AM. We bought new shampoo at 3PM.  I just used the new shampoo. I feel so good. I put a hair mask. I feel so clean. And though the damn thing coz a bomb, it's all so worthied.  Okay. I don't know why I wrote all of that; but I would like to point out that --  "Salon Products are good products. Don't let your hair be victimized and pick the right brands and the right shampoos! And remember to mask atleast once a week and get your hair trimmed every 6 months!" :D

       Y'know, titles are one helluva bitch. It always takes atleast 10 minutes to come up with one. Best part is; half the time you don't even know why you bother. You just bother and take time to come up with something "philosophical" or humoros only to complain about it after you've typed it all out. Paradoxical.  Oh well. Got my period unexpectedly. Not that anyone of you needed to know that - but I just felt like sharing. It just came out, all outta the blue, no warning signs whatsoever (okay, maybe SOME warning signs which I chose to ignore: a few weird cramps a few days again). It didn't even come according to schedule. Oh no. It just came. Caught me off-guard. Full force pain.  I had to skip german. My first class in almost 2 months. Yeah. That's going to help me. Missing out on ONE class is like just ... hangman. You really do miss out alot in that 3 1/2 hours of not being there. I'll just have to revise and pretend I know what I'm doing I guess. Wish me luck.  Nothing much has happen. I'd usually complain and say what a pathetic unsocial person I am being at home for always 10 days now - but somehow, I'm enjoying this peace and quiet. Money is NOT being spend, I don't need to tweeze my eyebrows or my armpits, no need to figure out what to wear - I can be at home looking like a complete drag and no one cares. It's perfect. Curling up with my books, with not a thing in the world to do but occupy myself. It's all really boring to be honest - but somehow soooo tranquil.  Been thinking about the future again. I'm still scared of it. Before I atleast had a rough sketch on what I planned to do after I graduate; now I'm just lost. I keep on coming up with other plans, erasing the previous ones which I've managed to cojure up so perfectly. I'm just to fickled. But then again, it is my future; I should be open to any possibility of having something better and more exciting - but there's no direction. It's just ideas. Ideas everywhere. But no promise, no concrete good-outcome, simply no direction.  I'll have to think about this future thing real seriously soon.

       I went to the doctor's yesterday because I was forced to take a urine test by mom. 9AM and I'm aiming my pee into a jar. Grand. I was given some antibiotics for my sore throat and under the weather body.  4 hours later, I manage to lose a huge pack of antibiotics. I'll have to march my ass to the doctor's later this evening to get another pack. Turns out I need the antibiotics more than I thought I did with my close encounter with death last night at 3AM. My body decided to forget how to breathe and my lungs decided to compress itself.   Kinda felt like I was a fish that was taken out of the water. Notice how they flap about and how their mouths move when you pull them out from water? Yeah. I was doing the same thing.  Mom came in to check on me hourly.  Basically to see if I were still alive. I kept on falling in and out of sleep.    My optical mouse was being a bitch. I'm back to the old-school rollerball one. I feel so stupid for taking that scroll button for granted. It's so difficult without it.

       I finally revised my german work. Lektion 1-4. After a whole month of letting them german books negotiate current affairs with the dust particles. Dust particles seem to have really got along with what the german books had to say as they seem pretty much at home and I had to ask them to get lost with the help of Mr. Tissue.  I'm so scared I'm going to fail my end-year super-important-certificate-to-be-given-if-passed German exam. If I fail it, I'll have to resit G1 again. That's another whole year. I need to get to G2. I need to know how to say more german besides my already trite "Ich spreche nicht gut Deutsch". It doesn't matter that I've mastered each syllable and it's pronounciation, it doesn't matter I can say it as easy as I can say "OH WOW WEE WOW" - I have to develope abilities and brain power to say more. I have to be able to proudly go around reciting all Goethe's german poems and works and say all them german vocabs properly and be all masterful at the language.  I have to pass the damn test which I'll be sitting for on the dreaded day of DECEMBER the 18th.  Perhaps I'm worrying too much. But then, I should worry about it's not so far away. I mean, it is... but it isn't, y'know? I mean, I thought it was February but it's really July..No wait, It's already August? I mean, don't you see how fast time is passing by? It's faster that my fingers clicking on the familiar keys on the keyboard as I type this paragraph. Tick tock tick tock. Seconds are sprinting faster that anything in the world. Time is so limited it eats at your conscience. It just eats, and eats, and eats and your paranoia reaches such a high stance that you will eventually blow up and your body will give in to a nervous breakdown.   But why is that? Why is that you ask? Simply because we're always incapable of handling everything around us as fast as we're suppose to. We're too slow at absorbing and we're too slow at dealing with our enviroment. We just think we can, so we take in more and more - but in black and white reality, we're incapable. We're innate to believe that we can, but we can't. No one told us we can't. Everyone says we must try and try and try and if we try it'd be possible and all that bullshit - but we can't. We just suffer and drive ourselves to the brink of overloaded anxiety and stress and that's why so many of us are dropping like flies from heart attacks and why we're all growing more white hair and having many more wrinkles.  It's terrible what we're becoming into.  Where was I again? Yes, my german. So anyways, I've done Lektion 1 and will find somemore "will" to memorize the questions and get my fat ass to do the same with the rest of the Lektions I'm forced to truly understand.   I wish I was a portege who picked up language as fast as I pick up chocolate and understand it's ever soothing sweetness and taste. But alas, I am not that fictional charater Gaia from the book by Francine Pascal called "Fearless" and neither am I, Adrian Monk's older brother, Anthony Monk.  Languages for some vile reasons; HATE me.
