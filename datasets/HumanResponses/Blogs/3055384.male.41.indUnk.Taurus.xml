      A great big welcome to  Mark Van Kooy  who will be participating on this blog shortly.  Mark joins us to help spread the word about all things Edgy at  Northern Edge Algonquin  and will be spending most of his time in our South River office.  When you call, be sure to offer a hearty, "Welcome to the Team" if you reach Mark by phone. Talk about jumping into things, mid summer, our busiest time of the year is a wonderful, and busy time of the year to get involved.  Mark is learning first hand what multi-tasking is all about.

      Todd and Martha went to North Bay last night for the finals of the Million Dollar Hole in One contest.  It was quite exciting as I qualified for the finals and finished second among the 50 semi-finalists.  Golf is an enjoyable escape, one that I have had little time to indulge in over the past ten years here at the edge.  However this year, I've taken my fair share of swings.  It's really about giving myself permission to take time to enjoy things that I enjoy.  Over the past two winters snow boarding has taken root in my soul, displacing curling as the activity of choice.  I used to think I didn't have time to play, but now I make it a priority.   What do you need to step away from to make room for doing things you enjoy to do.  For me it was as simple as replacing TV viewing with activity.  I hope you can make similar choices to enjoy the great outdoors in your world, if not, take a complete departure and come play in ours at the Edge of Algonquin Park.

       The Blue Moon, (second full moon in a month) has come and gone as coincidentally so have our wonderful display of Northern Lights.  However, skywatchers can get a treat almost any clear night of the year, especially in Algonquin Park, where dark skys reign.  Countless stars and the band of our galaxy, the Milky Way are clearly visible.  Something I like to call "The Show" also takes place a few times each day.  Extremely bright satellites made of Iridium are used to transmit satellite telephone calls.  Our remote sat phone uses these satellites which pass over head frequently.  A wonderful website called  urlLink  Heavens Above   lists regular occurances of Iridium Flares for virtually any location on the planet.  These flares occur in pinpoints in thy sky when the antennae of the satellite bounces the suns light in the direction of observers on  earth.  The flash of a few seconds grows in brightness to 10 times as bright as a full moon.  And then quickly it disappears.  Most who see it let out an audible gasp.  The neat thing about  urlLink  Heavens Above   is  that the web site lists the exact point in the sky as well as the time of day to seek these neat happenings out.  I also recommend getting a list of the visual passes of the International Space Station as it soars overhead.  It doesn't take long to find your way around the night sky with a watch, a compass and a field manual for the stars.  Incidentally, this too is available in lots of places online including SkyandTelescope.com. Although usually much more brief and certainly smaller than Northern Lights, the show makes me say, " Wow!" every time I see it.

      A giant sunspot that has been ongoing for a week, has been delighting late night skywatchers near Algonquin Park, (and further afield) with a wonderful green aurora from time to time.  The shimmering night light occassionally shooting 60 degrees hight on the horizon.  Hopefully it will continue to delight over the next week or so.  The moon is waxing towards a full crescent which can make the milky way a bit washed out for early evening sky watchers, but the summer stars are still putting on a good show as we've had clear skies for the past four nights.    On your visit to the Edge, be sure to pinhole me into giving you a brief sky tour of the major constellations and perhaps sharing some ancient tales of the stars or makimaking up our own.

       I am continually impressed with how amazing people look when they haven't been around a mirror for a few days, (present company excepted).&nbsp; Our guests out on  urlLink wilderness adventures  with the sun on their face and wind in their hair are often concerned how they look.&nbsp;    The truth is most of the time, people look marvelous.&nbsp; Maybe its the fresh air, the clean water, the activity, the great food or the companionship of likeminded travellers.&nbsp;  Whatever it is, I really enjoy taking candid close ups of people when we're out on trips in Algonquin Park or in Georgian Bay, and 99% of the time people are amazed at the outcome.&nbsp;   Most people don't like getting their picture taken and take lots of time to fuss with their hair, adjust their makeup etc.&nbsp; In nature, we all look good.&nbsp;

      Hi Everyone, I've been working on our community keywords at  urlLink Paddling Ontario .  It promises to be a very wonderful thing.  Particularly with our Adwords campaign.  Meanwhile there are quite a few new events happening at Northern Edge Algonquin.  I'm especially excited about  urlLink The Tibetan Monks Retreat .  This will be the monks third visit to the Edge.  Gotta Run.  This is just a test.  Todd.

      March 26th, 2004 Maple sap is flowing at . urlLink Northern Edge Algonquin .  I haven't got time to boil today, but the weekend should be yummy.  We've planned a slew of paddling experiences by canoe and kayak this summer.  I hope that all works out.   Over the past week I've been making major uploads to google.com to buy adwords with Paddlingontario.com .  We're quite happy with the progress so far and hope for significant traffic to our our revamped web site in the next few months. We had another inquiry on our . urlLink Newfoundland Sea Kayak Trip  today.  I sure hope we get one more person to join us on this excursion.  The people in Newfoundland are unlike any others in the world.   Very friendly although difficult to understand for a few days.  The spring thaw at the Edge should be on for good now.  Although it snowed a ton last weekend, 5 inches, we're looking forward to full on boiling weather. - sap again.  Burned two batches already this year.  Hopefully replacing my watch will ensure that that doesn't happen again.

      It's almost time for Blossoms & Black Flies.  Christine Tinker headed over to the arena today to help get things set up.  Last year was an energizing day for all.  If you are in the neighbourhood, be sure to stop in and say hello! May 1st at the South River/Machar Arena.  Pick up your free Black Fly Hunting License and see all that's new and natural in the South River area.  We're especially excited to be sharing this event with 'Celtic Roots' - the Sheridan and friends family band.  After the exhibition, we're heading to the Edge for a pot luck hoe down.  Hope you can join us.

      I sometimes take for granted some of the wonderful food and drink I enjoy at our home, Northern Edge Algonquin.  Recently visiting another outdoor facility for a symposium on experiential education, Martha & I came away with this proclamation:  "We will not leave home again without bringing some of our terrifically tasty organic fair trade coffee!"  When we leave our everyday surroundings it can make us aware of what really special things we appreciate about being home.  Since being spoiled on our coffee, I find it impossible to enjoy coffee in a Tim Hortons, hotel, restaurant or other location that doesn't serve quality coffee.  During Martha and my weekend together we came to appreciate our food  and the attention and care that goes into providing delicious, soul food.  It's easy to be numbed into a sense of complacency about poor quality food.  It's available everywhere.  When we put a few overpowering taste-enhancers on our takeout meal or in a restaurant it really does reflect something of the quality of food we're eating.  Thank you to our kitchen staff who put the time and energy into meal preparation that results in food that tastes wonderful and energizes us.   urlLink toddles   urlLink Northern Edge Algonquin - Home

      Martha and I are heading to Bark Lake for the weekend for an experiential education symposium.  It feels like a good time to step away from the Edge and reconnect with each other and our dreams for this special place.  I find it interesting that even living in this special place, on the edge of Algonquin Park, that we need to get away.  It's kind of like the first time I saw earth from outer space in a picture taken by astronauts.  It's much easier to see the big picture, when we don't have our nose on the canvas.  So although it's been getting delightfully busy around these parts  we'll take a few restorative days for ourselves.  On Monday, its sure to be hectic, but for now I'll just slow down, sit by someone else's lake and dream, create and celebrate.  Have a great weekend.   urlLink  toddles

      Last night as I sat out in my gazebo working on our annual newsletter ,watching the sun set on shimmering Eagle lake I felt an overwhelming thankfulness. A lifestyle that enables one to work and play all in the same space. Magic is what it is ,nature coming back to life and I am able to witness it first hand daily. I was joyfully surprised this morning to be greeted by a big beaver who was sitting quietly at my car waiting for me. I just happened to have my camera in my bag so with his or her permission I took a few shots and of it went down the road. What a great way to start the day and the new season. One can be sure that many more animal viewings are around the corner here in the Algonquin region.

      A wonderful day on the Edge of  urlLink Algonquin Park  today.  Sunny and warming up.  Lost a batch of syrup today.  Not sure what happened, I left a batch that was perhaps an hour from being ready so that I could get on the road.  When I came home it was a gluey mess.  I've never had that happen before.  It must have gotten contaminated somehow.  Anyway, what do you do with two gallons of unfinished, gluey syrup anyway?  Might have to go for a long walk and dig a hole and bury it so we don't attract wild animals.  . . .   Speaking of which, I saw five deer just down the road yesterday.  It's that time of the year when deer and moose are regularly sighted on the roads, particularly in the early dawn and twilight hours.  I'll try to catch a picture over the next few weeks to share with the blog.     urlLink Toddles

      Last night at 10:30 pm I arrived home to the lodge after visiting family for the weekend.  The wind was howling and I put my headlights on and walked to the lakeshore.    There bobbing in waves were many small chunks of ice as the entire lake had broken free of its winter shape.  I got to wondering if the water remembered how to roll in as waves when the wind blew.  The water seemed to be screaming, "I'm free!" When I headed in and shared the news with Martha, she was quick to deny the possibility that the lake was open because she had seen it iced over at 9:00 pm.  Well all you eager paddlers, I'm here to confirm that the ice broke free between 9:00 pm and 10:30 pm on April 18th.  If you check this blog just a few weeks ago, I correctly predicted that indeed the ice would be out on the 18th of April.   The picture included above was taken in the morning on the 19th.  By all reports the water quality is excellent and it bodes well for a great year of paddling in Algonquin Park!

      Much of what we do at the Edge of Algonquin Park owes itself to a lifestyle that connects us to nature.  One of the things I do each spring is make maple syrup.   Here is a picture of our maple syrup set up in the forest.  We have about sixty trees tapped and the sap flows downhill in tubes, reaching a collecting spot beside the evaporator pan.  We do the preliminary boil down here. Then we move to the deck where we finish boiling the water away.  Here is Tim skimming the foam off the surface of the almost ready syrup.    The thermometer is important because we can tell its syrup when the temp hits 7 degrees Celcius above boiling water.  Usually within a degree of 107 degrees C. depending on the barometric pressure 'round these parts on the day of the boil. And when its all done.....  we pour it through a filter to remove the nitre (metal deposits that come out of solution when the water boils away).  Seems the trees pull up disolved metals from the earth along with the sugars stored deep in the trees roots.  Our filter is felt, and with a few sterilized bottles at the ready,  we have quite a harvest every few days in April. Be sure to come up for a visit and try some, won't you?

      We touched up our video a bit today, and got back into boiling sap.  Looks like a fine week for sap with perfect temps in the Algonquin Park area for the trees to dig down deep and bring up nature's sweetness. Boil on....

      So, Golf Fans . . . by now you know that Mike Weir missed the cut at the Masters.  We'll get through it if we just stick together.   It's been a great day for boiling sap here on the Edge of Algonquin Park.  Sunny and warm.  Cracks starting to form on the lake and Tim keeps catching glimpses of what might be an otter playing near the shore. The snow is slowly disappearing and spring is in the air.  We had a mini disaster today; one of our web sites had a mini melt down.  It allowed Martha and I to sit at the computer and bring it back while setting up a blog space specifically for Martha's medicine for the earth thoughts.

      It's Masters Weekend.  The sun is shining and the sap is flowing at Northern Edge Algonquin.  I'll be keeping an eye on the leaderboard on  urlLink www.masters.org   while spending time in the sun boiling more sap into syrup.  I'm also working hard at growing the  urlLink South River Black Fly Hunt .  We had a great time and got lots of radio on CBC across the country.  This year we hope to work with a media relations company to increase the exposure of this event which opens the doors to enjoying the great outdoors despite the bugs.  To be honest, at the end of last May, I enjoyed going out in the bugs and was usually cursing the lack of Black Flys.  With my net in hand, I was interested in seeing where the bugs were and doing what I could to capture them.  Take a peak at the black fly hunt web site.  It's delightful, particularly the black fly hunt page.  The exhibition on May 1st is also a wonderful spring event that gets everyone to the arena in South River to see what's happening locally and regionally in the great outdoors.  We're also setting to guessing when the ice is going to leave the lake, opening our canoeing path into Algonquin Park.  The last two years its left within three days of the 19th of April.  It's been a cold winter and the ice was thick (until I went through it April 4th).  If the wind blows hard for a couple of days that may be all it takes.  Ice will leave between now and May 1st, I'm going on record as guessing......... drum roll........... April 18th at 10:30 am. Stay tuned for the actual time/date the ice leaves.  Ciao for now,   urlLink toddles   urlLink Northern Edge Algonquin - Home

      It's decision time at the Northern Edge of Algonquin Park.  To get an atv or not to get an atv, that is the question.  We've been doing a lot of procrastination in deciding what to do about our seasonal change overs.  Canoe trips in Algonquin Park, Snow shoe treks on crown land . . . Each spring and fall we put a lot of energy in people power in moving things around, bringing out new equipment for the season, putting away last season's stuff.  We also have a remote camp that we set up in the winter, to enjoy backcountry adventures, sometimes sleeping out, but always enjoying wonderful meals.    We have also spent a lot of time hiking and mountain biking and preparing and clearing trails of debris (fallen trees) and such.   I'm sure it would be helpful in gardening and moving trailers around as well.  Of course we'd be using it in the forest harvesting fallen trees for firewood too.  The Question is can we afford to continue spending the staff time doing these seasonal chores, or would it be better to invest in a tool that makes life a lot easier and reduces the time we spend on such things. . . and long term, the cost of doing these things.  The issue really is one of cost.  Putting up front $8000 for a new ATV or half that for something 8-10 years is an issue.  At the low time of the season, we don't have a lot of income to cover such an expense, so each spring we do it by a lot by hand.  Also some by truck.  Without getting a tool like this now, we will continue to have ongoing expenses that are hard to pin down.  Work just takes longer to do by hand and foot.  A few years ago, I would never have imagined having an ATV at the Edge, but way out here on the edge of Algonquin Park, it might be a practical expense.  . . . and as the pricing of used ATV's shows, these things tend to hold their value pretty well.  Over 10 years its $400/year.  Any advice from webland appreciated on this one.    urlLink toddles   urlLink Northern Edge Algonquin - Home

      Hello Edge Friends from Martha.  With spring in the air, I've been busy planting seeds up in the butterfly room. Each day the little seedlings grow more and more.  Last night I facilitated the local Medicine for the Earth gathering, where we journeyed to ask what seed or seeds within would like to be planted.  With intention we each planted seeds that we will nurture and grow, that represent the seeds in our lives that we wish to nurture and grow.  So, as I plant each seed that will eventually go into the garden, I am mindful of what seed in my life I am planting.  Happy spring, and happy planting!

      Hi everyone, Time to get the snow tires off my car today.  We got shocked last weekend with three inches of snow and temps back in the -10's C, but I think we're through the worst of it. I'm heading to North Bay to have them make the switch at the dealer, because no one locally in South River is capabable of easily changing the 17 inch rims.  Alas.  The last few kms of road to the edge should be sloppy for a few weeks.  The drains got plugged up and the water had nowhere to run except across the road.   Makes for a nice slalom course of ruts if you're into it.  Last year one section of the road was entirely washed away for a few days.  A two foot wide and deep scar made the road impassable unless you carried some two by eights in your car and had the nerve to try to line up the tires.  Nothing like that yet this year..... yet.  It seems April is the worst time of the year for the roads.  Sometimes makes you feel like just pulling up a chair and boiling sap.    Speaking of which, we're expecting a decent run over the next few days as temps moderate and the sun shines.  Spring is a magical time of the year.  The snow melts and tiny spring flowers begin to show themselves.  Soon the smell of earthiness returns to the land and before you know it, all is green and you can't see the forest cabins from the lodge.  Not here yet though, last week got the spring fever going and we got a bit lazy with keeping the fireplace going.  As a result we've had some chilly mornings in the lodge.     Did you see the full moon last night.  Ahhhhh.  Amazing.  See you soon,   urlLink toddles   urlLink Northern Edge Algonquin - Home

      As  urlLink Northern Edge Algonquin  heads into the summer, we'd like to announce that Liz Jones has joined the team. Congrats Liz, looking forward to sharing a wonderful summer at the Edge with you.  and in other news.... have you checked out our  urlLink Crossword Puzzle   yet.  It rocks.  Look for a new puzzle each season.  I highly recommend having a peak at all the new events this year.  It's sure to be a fun one.  Get in the water and join in the fun.  By the way, yesterday, April 4th, I went out for what was to be the last ice skate of the season.  It turned out to be the first swim of the season if you know what I mean.  Really, it was a swim.  You might think me silly for such bravado, but it's been downright chilly for the past three days.  Sap is all boiled up and I'm waiting for another run, so I just thought I'd take a chance.  So far we've made over two gallons of Syrup, all in smaller containers.  It's definitely Grade A.  I'm sure Greg will appreciate me doing the final boil on the kitchen deck as all that sweet sappy steam works its way into the roof.  Hopefully we won't be battling bees this summer.  I should take a picture and upload it so you can see our rig!   urlLink There now. Click Here.   I'm not pictured but our rig is.... and helping hands from Sir Sandford Fleming College Ecotourism Management Course.  Anway... First swim of the season, April 4th.  Beat that Greg.

      All over Canada, people are hearing about the South River Black Fly Hunt.  Our beloved Rusty Perkins, World Champion Black Fly Hunter, was featured on CTV and some outlets across Canada, including Calgary even featured the story!! As the spring hunt nears its end,here on the edge of Algonquin Park urlLink  (Northern Edge Algonquin - Home)  the Black Flies are out on the prowl.  We all take it in stride, because we know they are here to make sure the birds are happy (lots of protien) and the plants including blueberries are fertilized. Many locals don't use any protection against the black fly, but some wear locally made bug shirts with a fine mesh that keeps the bugs at bay.  Others use products which contain deet.  Incidentally I was speaking with a friend in Toronto recently who went to school with a child of the originator of MUSKOL brand deet repellant.  His last name was KOL for those who are interested. I've been using Off Botanicals formula which has no deet and has been working remarkably well.  For those who take my word for it and head to the drug store to pick some up, be forwarned.... the stuff is two-three times the cost of deet based products.  But, hey, it smells good, works, and won't harm my dna. For those in the city, who may join us in the Blue Sky Region this summer, you should know we are doing our part to enhance your stay with the black fly hunt.  Visit  urlLink www.blackflyhunt.ca  to learn more.  The big weigh in is this Saturday and we're hoping the national media give the event all the attention it deserves.  Full report forthcoming.   urlLink toddles   urlLink Northern Edge Algonquin - Home

       Still lots of trout lilies, red trillium and spring beauties in the forest at the Edge of Algonquin Park this week.    The leaf-out of the maples, raspberries and ferns challenges forest walkers to keep a keen look out for late blooming forest flowers.  Yesterday, Martha and I were rewarded with the first sighting in the neighbourhood of a white trillium, pictured at right.  Our forest is full of red trillium and over ten years we've never seen a white one. Also unfolding are fiddleheads - ferns.  Lots of local people enjoy these delicacies, but we just let them grow.  Bear, moose and deer sightings in the neighbourhood have been few in the past week.  It seems the cool weather has kept bug populations a bit lower than normal so the animals aren't seeking respit from the black fly torment by walking on the roads.  I'll keep my camera at the ready and snap a photo of a moose for this blog in the next week.

      It's been damp and cool the past week, keeping many folks from enjoying the beautiful outdoors.  Martha and I went for a walk last night and I really appreciated the green-ness of our home.  The mist hung in the air enveloping us in a cloak.   Every once in a while I take a deep inhale and actually feel like I'm smelling the colour of green.  The moisture in the air helps make the forest smells more noticable and the sweetness of the earth mixed with green leaves is wonderful.

       Wahoo!  It is amazing how good it feels to feel good.  Sometimes it takes being out of sorts for a while to appreciate how wonderful it is to have health.  My back is back!  The roof on Points North is springing forth with new growth.  Soon the waves of wildflowers will be casting shadows into the rooms below.    In the forest, wildflowers are springing forth.  Beautiful red trillium, delicate spring beauties (forground of pic) and hesitant speckle-leaved trout lilies vie for attention.   This weekend is traditionally the time when black flies reach their peak.  Walking through the forest is quite enjoyable, but at this time of year we don't take too long to smell the flowers.  There is great excitement in town as all kinds of people are engaged in the great  urlLink black fly hunt .  Take a peak at this cute site with audio tips from World Champion Black Fly Hunter, Rusty Perkins.  Todd's been busy arranging banners, awards, and events to coincide with the official weigh in at noon on June 5th.  Be sure to visit if you have a chance.

      Ok, so it's not an inspiring title, it's the state of my personal health.  When I went for my first kayak paddle of the season the other day, something slipped out of place and it's been causing me some pain the past few days. It can be very frustrating to want to be active on the lake, seeing the blue water, paddlers heading into Algonquin Park on fishing trips, Greg and Vicki Sea Kayaking amoung the islands ... I will enjoy it all the more when I'm healthy again. The  urlLink Sea Kayaking Guru  and Vicki are heading to Parry Sound this weekend for the Sea Kayaking Symposium and concert and an enjoyable camping and kayaking weekend.  I'm a bit jealous, but in no position to participate.  Next weekend is our first scheduled  urlLink Quest for Balance   Sea Kayaking Clinic.  It's not too late to join us for the May Long Weekend.  Get a jump on the paddling season by getting flat water kayaking certification.  Mention this Blog and  we'll take $50.00 off  for registration for this weekend only.  Hope the sun is shining where you are and the bugs are scarce.   Cheers, urlLink toddles   urlLink Northern Edge Algonquin - Home

       The flowers may not be ready for picking but there was lots of harvesting going on at Northern Edge Algonquin on Saturday. Our womens creative day of Basket making out of natural homegrown fibers was amazing. Raspberry cane, fallen birch bark, cedar bark,lots of grapevine(imported from Southern Ontario with our basket guru Lynn Kennedy)were some of the amazing gifts from nature we used to weave beatiful baskets. As I collected I felt thankful for the privilage to live so close to nature in this beauiful region called Algonquin. I now look at these natural weaving materials with a new eye and excitement for what one can create with just a little imagination.

      I got up with the sun and paddled my kayak for the first time this year.  I kept the commitment I made to myself to get on the water today.   Busy bees were at work around the lodge today.  Kim and Liz have been staining the gazebo, checking the tents and other equipment, and Brian May has been power washing the windows.  Power at the lodge is peaking, the batteries are full.  It's a nice time of the year with the long, long days, the batteries are regularly full of power from our 22 solar panels.  I've been scoping out the lakefront and considering (in very early stages) if we should add wind power later this year.  It seems silly to think about adding capacity for power at a time when we have all we need, but the shorter days will come back later this year, of that I'm pretty sure.    We've got a 50' tower behind the lodge that has no use at present so later this spring we'll take it down.  At one point in time it was important for telephone communications antenna, but since we now use the internet phone via satellite out at the lodge, there is no need for the tower.  It is just about high enough to reach above the trees at the east side of the property near the lake, so if we can find an economically priced wind generator, we may set it up.

      Every spring, the opportunity comes back.  Do I grasp it and paddle at whatever time of day the urge strikes, or do I let another day go by and think about doing it tomorrow instead.  All too often, my personal choice is to let it go for another day.  Living on the Edge of Algonquin Park presents me with so many opportunities to enjoy the outdoors that its easy to let a month go by without getting on the water.  Isn't it the same with other important things in my life, like time spent sharing with others?    I'm going to paddle tomorrow morning at sunrise.  Greg is gearing up for an important sea kayaking clinic in less than two weeks to get his level 3 certification.  It is an extremely difficult criteria he wants to meet, so Greg is in training.   He's also teaching  urlLink algonquincanada.com/google.htm">introductory sea kayaking clinics   at the Edge through the summer on our Quest for Balance Weekends.  I'm excited that my daughter Emily is going to get her flatwater kayaking certificate from Greg with our guests on the May long weekend.  I'm going to up to the kilnhouse and spend a bit of time with Greg this evening, so ciao for now.   urlLink toddles   urlLink Northern Edge Algonquin - Home

      I walked the lakefront today and was delighted to see the buds on the birches springing forth.  Wildflowers in the garden have made their commitment to grow.  Spring peepers fill the early evening air with song.  It's a beautiful time of the year.  It's also time for the forest animals to make their presence known.  A family of foxes lives just over the hill and very often on my way to town at this time of the year we see mom and her offspring at the edge of the forest.  Last night on my drive from town I encountered a black bear lumbering across the road. Closer to the lodge I saw a few deer at the side of the road.  At this time of year, driving becomes a bit more challenging as soon moose will come out of the bush to get away from the bugs.  Driving slowly isn't just good advice, it can save your life in the case of moose.  We hope you are taking time to spring forth new growth in your life as we prepare the way with our own spring cleaning.  Here is a picture of the lake from just behind and above the lodge.

      The election was interesting to most Canadians due to its closeness in the days and weeks preceeding between the red and blue parties.   The orange party added a bit of green to their logo and their celebrated leader garnered much media attention.  The Bloc of course got their media attention where it was warranted, in Quebec.   Overlooked, and disregarded by most election coverage, the Green Party quietly came to life during the 2004 election when it counted, on Election Day.  Although excluded from the TV debates, the Green Party garnered over half a million votes from Canadians all across Canada!!  On the Edge of Algonquin Park, there are 6 registered voters in poll 184 of Nipissing-Temiskaming (5 of them live here at the Edge and unashamedly vote Green).  They took a little drive yesterday to get to the polls.  Thankfully, the poll was recently moved to Trout Creek from Mattawa, now just a 30 minute drive, instead of 90 minutes.  With the Greens receiving almost 4% of ballots cast across the country, the federal Green Party will now qualify for funding in the amount of @ ONE MILLION DOLLARS.  This is an amazing boon to those who support government that looks at the role of elected officials as having to balance environmental, socialogical, health and wellness, and economic issues on an equal plane.  The funding will enable the Greens for the first time to get organized to make a real impact the next federal election.  It is interesting to note that Canada's Broadcasting Company web site gives little attention to the Green party performance lumping their votes in with "Other" so as to justify excluding the Greens from the national televised debate.  I find this upsetting.   urlLink See for yourself  .  I took a moment of my time to let the CBC know I was unhappy about this by completing their  urlLink  web feedback form  and encourage you to do the same.   Over my lifetime, I have seen the multi-party system grow into something quite unique in the world.  Unfortunately, most support for policial parties in the country is regional, where economic and social needs motivate voters to side with one another creating clusters of similar coloured ridings on the results map.  Different colours for different regions.    The Green Party represents a broad base of voters, and offers something to Canadians right across the country, a vision that isn't based on what people want to hear today to get elected, a vision that supports sustainability for generations.    Hopefully with the well earned recognition the party will be receiving in the not too distant future, the party will lure some aspiring talented politicians who will inspire Canadians to join a small but growing movement to vote "for" something, instead of against.

      Today is election day in Canada, and here at the Edge, we're making a special effort to go to the polls.  While most people can vote just around the corner, our polling station is in North Bay, a one hour drive!  Interestingly, although we are about 20 km east of our office in South River, our poll is way up north in Nipissing/Temiskaming region, while South River is in the Parry Sound/Muskoka riding.  Take a look at the riding map.  In technical terms when our visitors stop in our office in South River, they are in southern Ontario, while when they arrive at the nature retreat at the edge of Algonquin Park, they cross a boundary line into Northern Ontario. See the map of our dilemma here: urlLink Algonquin Park Electoral boundaries map   May all of Canada be inspired to elect a government that looks after the needs of people's health, environmental responsibility and economic well being... time will tell.  On the natural front: I spotted a male deer this morning with some velvety antlers that look like they have grown quite a bit.  It made me realize that the summer is here and its time to make the most of it.  Will do.

      We're entering our busiest time of the year at the edge of  urlLink Algonquin Park   this week.  We've been doing quite a few facility enhancements with new gardens at the kilnhouse, fire circle and dining cabin.  Next weekend we're hosting a large group that is joining us from  urlLink Union Station  in Toronto.  We're riding in style on the Northlander train right to South River, where we'll be shuttled out to the lodge for a few days of adventure, creating, and dreaming.   We also host a number of overnight guests who are heading out on a canoe trip into Algonquin Park over the long weekend.  Yes, there are a few spaces left, if you would like to join us. Today, Tim is in North Bay helping out with the Nipissing Stage Company performance at Nipissing University.  On our way to pick him up we're also picking up our refurbished canoes - Martha and Todd's that is.  One pink and one blue that have had their gunnels and seats replaced.  We're also picking up our refurbished canvas for our dining tent.  Looking forward to getting that set up! Also, some friends in North Bay at the Iron Works Cafe have sadly closed their doors.  Iron Works was perhaps the best stop in North Bay for a delectible home-made lunch featuring great cuiches, salads, wraps and more.  Luckily, Martha stopped by for lunch yesterday and loe and behold Karen (owner) offered to sell us a number of iron-legged chairs, tables and more.  We are very happy to be sharing some Iron Works energy at the Edge.  We have yet to decide where all the new things will go, but we are looking forward to posting pictures of the new decor soon. Speaking of pictures, our camera hunt continues after our coolpix bit the dust.  My Ebay bidding will soon result in a new camera and a bevy of new images I'm sure. Time to empty the van of the new Iron Works items so that we can pick up our canoes.  Back to you soon. Happy Paddlin!   urlLink toddles   urlLink Northern Edge Algonquin - Home

      Tim and I went on a driving adventure this morning.  Backroads tour! We happened upon a decimated turtle nest.  A recent rain made it difficult to spot who the invader was, but it was likely a fox from the evidence.  Dozens of egg shells a bit smaller than ping pong balls were scattered about from two nests.  There were three opaque eggs left in one of the nests about 10 inches below the surface.  We covered these eggs over in the hopes that the snapping turtle yolk within, continue to develop and crawl to the surface to see the light of day in August.  A bit further along we came upon a bruin at the side of the road.  Upon hearing us, he headed for the tree line.  We stopped the car and turned off the engine and looked into the forest.  To our surprise we could clearly see the bear's head as he looked us over for a few minutes.  The full size of the bear became apparent to us.  We watched him amble along as he made quite a racket crashing through the branches on his way up the hill away from us.  It was quite exciting as we really felt like we were on a safari.

      By whatever name they are known by these small damselflies have emerged today.  Often seen clinging to screens whith their wings folded together flat these greenish June bugs have joined other water critters who have come out of the lake for their brief sexual life. These bugs are not as prevalent on our small lake as on larger lakes throughout Ontario and their annual visit usually lasts less than a week. In the early evening they fly like they are riding an elevator, flapping thier wings to go up, up, up, up, dooowwwwwnnnnn.  Perhaps this pattern is meant to be a mating ritual of sorts, but it seems to me it might be designed to avoid capture by birds.  It seems each evening that this dance is performed, and each evening a bevy of birds decends upon the dancing flies for dinner. Martha is presenting a basic shamanism workshop at the Edge this weekend and the eight participants from across Ontario seem to be quite enjoying the program.  Tonight, Dave (one of the participants) will be playing Chrystal Bowls as a sort of Summer Solstice event.  Unfortunately, our digital camera has gone on the blink (shortly after taking turtle pictures) and we'll need to replace it, so it is unlikely that images will be found here for a week or so until we get a new camera.  The camera was accidentally dropped about 10 days ago on a short bike ride that Tim and I went on seeking out dragon flies.  Alas.

      The snapping turtles are travelling to gravelly, sandy areas to lay their eggs.  Yesterday I spied a half dozen snappers hunched over their nests dropping eggs in and covering the nest over before retreating to their  homes in the mud of creeks, streams and lakes.  They seem to be seeking out just the right type of digging conditions and unfortunately for some, there seems to be just the right conditions on the gravel shoulders of the paved roadway.  I sure hope these hatchlings take off on the creek side of the road when they hatch out in mid to late August.

      We're Back Blogging. Our web servers were recently moved to provide better service, but it resulted in a blogless week.  We hope to make that up to you with a few timely notes on what is new and natural.   Eastern Tiger Swallowtails came to a bright existence earlier this week.  Small clusters of the yellow and black butterflies could be seen drying their wings in meadowy areas, not far from the woods.  These dancing butterflies seem to dart this way and that with each wingbeat.  The Green Darner Dragon Flies, among others took to the air the exact same day as the swallowtails.  Clouds of green darners must have walked ashore from their muddy homes in the lake in the evening.   Then over a period of a few hours they cast off their shells via a hatchback and dry their wings with the sunshine (see the carapice in the background as this dragon fly with broken wing sits in the sun). Often at this time of the year in the early morning you can catch a glimpse of dragon flies drying their wings before taking flight and chasing down black flies and mosquitoes to eat.  They are doing a fine job contributing to our enjoyment of the outdoors.

      As I stepped out of the lodge onto the porch today before coming to town I took a deep breath and savoured the sweet smell of the many flowers that are blooming.  I have discovered over the past few years that my sense of smell is delightfully triggered by the aroma of flowers throughout our natural landscape here at the edge of Algonquin Park.  Whether at the lakefront or walking through the forest, it's very pleasurable to take a breath of fresh sweet air. On my drive to work I stopped to move two turtles out of the middle of the road.  Of course they were sunning themselves.  Numerous times on my drive I spotted flocks of yellow and black butterflies at the side of the road.  Many were taking flight and I was wishing I had brought my camera along.  Alas, the battery is recharging at the lodge.  I'll try to snap a picture tomorrow if they are still about. It's amazing how much change can happen in one day.  As I go about my daily routine and spend time looking and sensing what is going on around me, my senses are bombarded and if I take the time I can discover something new or exciting every day. What's new and exciting in your world today? Late breaking news . . .  Dragon Flies are out!   I suppose it was those very warm temps of 26 degrees C, today that prompted the crustations to leave their muddy homes and head for shore.  Those gunships for mozzies and black flies are flying about in great numbers.  Seems today was the day for transformation as the dragon flies have taken to the wind (after 7 years of living in the mud at the bottom of the lake) to join a host of butterflies and moths that fill the air.

      Liz Jones, our new adventure manager and guide had a flying squirrel on her shoulder for a few minutes yesterday.  It was quite a surprise to say the least.  Mama squirrel and a couple of babies were nesting on a shelf in the supply room.    Flying Squirrels are remarkable creatures softly soaring through the treetops in the evening.  Thier very large black eyes are specially adapted to night time and this nocturnal squirrel is rarely seen during the day (unless one stumbles upon their nest Liz!).    Earlier this winter, we had flying squirrels at our bird feeder in the dark at dinner time.  One of the squirrels let us open the window and stroke its tail, not afraid in the least.  Liz's encounter was a trifle more of a surprise, and memorable to say the least.  Liz hopes to share more memorable natural encounters in Algonquin Park on  urlLink guided canoe trips   in the upcoming weeks.

      This morning I was scrambling for my digital camera as mother and father Canada goose and three little fluffy goslings paddled by the lodge, just a few feet from shore.  It was one of those moments when I debate, should I just soak this in or run and take a picture of them.   I waited and soaked it in.  Soaked it in some more as the heads bobbed forward and back as they paddled by.  Still, I had a few minutes to grab a snapshot!  I dashed upstairs and could not locate my camera until many minutes later, the geese were gone.  I tried to please you, the avid Algonquin Park blog reader by catching a snapshot of this moment, and in the process, I only grasped half of what was truly blissful.  Next time, I'll have the camera at my side, or not and I'll enjoy the moment either way.  It's a terrific day today.  Sunny and crisp.  Martha and I enjoyed a walk before heading to the office and I feel alive.  I hope you do too!

      A giant sunspot that has been ongoing for a week, has been delighting late night skywatchers near Algonquin Park, (and further afield) with a wonderful green aurora from time to time.  The shimmering night light occassionally shooting 60 degrees hight on the horizon.  Hopefully it will continue to delight over the next week or so.  The moon is waxing towards a full crescent which can make the milky way a bit washed out for early evening sky watchers, but the summer stars are still putting on a good show as we've had clear skies for the past four nights.    On your visit to the Edge, be sure to pinhole me into giving you a brief sky tour of the major constellations and perhaps sharing some ancient tales of the stars or makimaking up our own.

       Greg was giving a fine demonstration to our  urlLink Quest for Balance  guests of the need to have fine hip control for shifting weight while kayaking.  Martha had to step in and show him how its done.  With absolutely no previous documented hula hoop experience, Martha kept it going good.  Not sure where else she would learn such efficiency with her hips.... belly dancing practice?     while Greg, er , ahh, to put it nicely...... Didn't give up easily.  But in the end, the hula hoop won.

       Sunday morning had guests running for their cameras to get a shot of Bernie, the small black bear who has been visiting the past week.  Once everyone had a chance to snap a pic, it was time to make some noise to frighten the small cub away.  Bears make their homes in the forests of Ontario, and they will travel far and wide to find food.  Unfortunately, cottages and remote lodges usually have food and/or compost which can attract a bear.    Once a bear has found a reliable source, it is unlikely that he will leave.  Thus, we are embarking on a mission to encourage Bernie to leave the area, lest one of our neighbours takes it upon himself to shoot him.  The technique's we are using to discourage Bernie include: keeping compost free of sweet fruity items, cleaning barbeque grills, and making a big noise and trying to show Bernie that we are bigger bears than he is.

      We've been visited this week by a little bear who seems to be about a year old and without any effective parenting! The little bear has been seen wandering around through the forest and sitting up in trees.  He even ate the bulk of Greg and Vicki's lettuce,  "How Rude!", and peaked in on Liz as she was working in the Adventure Centre.  Of course we live in the middle of the forest and we relish the wildlife viewing opportunities that this affords us, but we'd really like it better if this cute little bear moved along.  Nosing about is one thing, but getting too comfortable around people is not acceptable.  We're hoping to snap a few photos before giving this little bear the big scare off!  Stay tuned.

Guests are arriving as I type for three nights of adventure, relaxation, reflection and sharing.    The colourful kayaks line the beach in preparation for guests who will learn to paddle.  It seems that canoeing is in the blood of each and every Canadian, but Kayaking is a different matter.  The closed shell can be a bit scary for the first time kayaker, but the thrill of being so low to the water and in personal control of your craft is hard to describe.  For many sea kayakers, life as a canoeist quickly becomes a fading memory.   For myself, the sea kayak has become my access to the  urlLink big sky   of Georgian Bay.  For at least two trips this summer I look forward to travelling with Greg to Snug Harbour to explore the Minks, Snake Island and other enticing islands near Kilbear Provincial Park.  The first of these trips departs next Thursday!  I just got a new camera, so I am most excited to snap some photos on our journey.

      We're greatly enjoying the mild temps this summer on the Edge of Algonquin Park.  Sunny skys and 20-23 degrees C seems to be the norm.  We're hoping for more of the same as the summer moves on.  Our first   urlLink Quest for Balance retreat  is this weekend and our first sea kayaking trip on Georgian Bay departs the following Thursday.  I'm very excited to be getting on the water myself for the first time this year with Greg on that  urlLink Big Sky Sea Kayaking trip .  We're excited to welcome Wendy MacCrimmon into the office this week.  She's getting a handle on all the neat experiences we've got planned this summer and we're quite excited that she has climbed on board.  Her expertise in Ecotourism from Sir Sandford Fleming is greatly appreciated and her cheery disposition is sure to make you feel welcome if you have a chance to speak with her on the phone or meet her on your visit to the Blue Canoe.  Our lodge computer hard drive crashed over the weekend.  Totally disabled the lodge pc and although we've lost a number of images, we have a pretty good back up of our important documents so we will cope.  It is refreshing to realize that it is a physical breakdown and not something caused by a virus.  In the meantime, we're all scrambling to make the most of the computer resources we have.  Also on that front, we're finding all sorts of interesting hidden talents of Scott Shailer, one of our guides.  Seems he's fascinated with databases and the like and is helping us make the most of our computers for registration and reporting to be well prepared for our guests.  That's what working at the Edge is all about, finding your unique talents and fitting them in where they are needed most.    Scott rose to the occasion a few nights ago with the word "Qana", to stave off a last minute comeback by yours truly in Scrabble.  I'd like to serve notice to Scott that he should gloat while he can, because I'll be better prepared next time.  FYI, Quana is some type of tunnel or moat in the middle east according to the third edition Scrabble Dictionary by Mirriam Websters.

      A great big welcome to  Mark Van Kooy  who will be participating on this blog shortly.  Mark joins us to help spread the word about all things Edgy at  Northern Edge Algonquin  and will be spending most of his time in our South River office.  When you call, be sure to offer a hearty, "Welcome to the Team" if you reach Mark by phone. Talk about jumping into things, mid summer, our busiest time of the year is a wonderful, and busy time of the year to get involved.  Mark is learning first hand what multi-tasking is all about.  Photo coming soon to a staff web page near you.

      Todd and Martha went to North Bay last night for the finals of the Million Dollar Hole in One contest.  It was quite exciting as I qualified for the finals and finished second among the 50 semi-finalists.  Golf is an enjoyable escape, one that I have had little time to indulge in over the past ten years here at the edge.  However this year, I've taken my fair share of swings.  It's really about giving myself permission to take time to enjoy things that I enjoy.  Over the past two winters snow boarding has taken root in my soul, displacing curling as the activity of choice.  I used to think I didn't have time to play, but now I make it a priority.   What do you need to step away from to make room for doing things you enjoy to do.  For me it was as simple as replacing TV viewing with activity.  I hope you can make similar choices to enjoy the great outdoors in your world, if not, take a complete departure and come play in ours at the Edge of Algonquin Park.

       The Blue Moon, (second full moon in a month) has come and gone as coincidentally so have our wonderful display of Northern Lights.  However, skywatchers can get a treat almost any clear night of the year, especially in Algonquin Park, where dark skys reign.  Countless stars and the band of our galaxy, the Milky Way are clearly visible.  Something I like to call "The Show" also takes place a few times each day.  Extremely bright satellites made of Iridium are used to transmit satellite telephone calls.  Our remote sat phone uses these satellites which pass over head frequently.  A wonderful website called  urlLink  Heavens Above   lists regular occurances of Iridium Flares for virtually any location on the planet.  These flares occur in pinpoints in thy sky when the antennae of the satellite bounces the suns light in the direction of observers on  earth.  The flash of a few seconds grows in brightness to 10 times as bright as a full moon.  And then quickly it disappears.  Most who see it let out an audible gasp.  The neat thing about  urlLink  Heavens Above   is  that the web site lists the exact point in the sky as well as the time of day to seek these neat happenings out.  I also recommend getting a list of the visual passes of the International Space Station as it soars overhead.  It doesn't take long to find your way around the night sky with a watch, a compass and a field manual for the stars.  Incidentally, this too is available in lots of places online including SkyandTelescope.com. Although usually much more brief and certainly smaller than Northern Lights, the show makes me say, " Wow!" every time I see it.
