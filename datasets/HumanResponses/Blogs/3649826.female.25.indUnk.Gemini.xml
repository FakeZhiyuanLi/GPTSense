      Ever since I can remember, my view of life, at least what I wanted it to be, was to be a wife and mother. As a child I never dreamed of becoming a doctor or lawyer, just to have my own family. Maybe it was due to being a child of a broken home or maybe it was that my nurturing side weighed heavier than my need for independance. Whatever the case, that was my goal for my life. As a child I went through alot of loss. My father left when I was 3 and not too long after that my mother gave me to my paternal grandparents. That was my structure. Then at the age of 7 I moved back with my mother and still continued to spend every weekend, school break, and holiday with my grandparents. At the age of 13 my grandmother died of breast cancer and that was the hardest loss for me as she was like a mother to me. She had instilled my traditional outlook on life, such as the woman takes care of the home and family and the father provides for the family. So, shortly after the loss of my grandmother my life felt empty. I moved in with my father at the age of 14 and after that I am unsure of how many times I moved back and forth between my parents. I desperately wanted my family structure back that I recieved at my grandparents. At the age of 15 I met a boy who was 16 and he came from the same ethnic background which was an important factor for me. I am a Native American and feel very strongly about marrying another Native American and having children with them, not because of race issues but because the Native American bloodline is thinning and I wanted my children to be recognized as an enrolled Native American. So that was one good trait for him and he also came from the same upbringing as I did. He was raised by his paternal grandparents also but remained living with them. So, we started dating and now 10 years later we are married with 3 children and planning on more. That is another outlook I have on life is that family is the most important thing to have in life. It is what gives you meaning, I believe. So I and my husband plan on having at least 5 children together and we try to raise them with those same values, along with Native American traditions and culture. As a child I lacked the knowledge and opportunities of learning more about my culture and thankfully my husband didn't so he is able to teach me and my children those ways. I wanted to write this as my first blog to give people a little look inside my life, of course there is so much more that I am sure I will be sharing later on!!
