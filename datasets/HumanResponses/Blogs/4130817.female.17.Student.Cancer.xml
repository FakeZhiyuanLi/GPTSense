      One SONG can spark a moment One FLOWER can wake the dream One TREE can start a forest One BIRD can herald spring One SMILE begins a friendship One HANDCLASP lifts a soul One STAR can guide a ship at sea One WORD can frame the goal One VOTE can change a nation One SUNBEAM lights a room One CANDLE wipes out darkness One LAUGH will conquer gloom One STEP must start each journey One WORD must start a prayer One HOPE will raise our spirits One TOUCH can show you care One VOICE can speak with wisdom One HEART can know what is true One LIFE can make a difference. - Author Unknown   Very interesting poem.  ~ash~

      This is from a book I am reading, and I thought it was very good quote or whatever you want to call it. " ' We can not tell the precise moment when friendship is formed. As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it run over; so in a series of kindnesses there is at last one which makes the heart run over.' "  Friendship is a very amazing thing, we should all have friends so we can express ourselves to other people and the world with our friends. If you dont have friendship you dont have manythings. It has been proven that people who grow up without people being around them and then them not expressing any of there feelings about things in the world dont grow up normal, but then again what is normal? I for sure am not normal and that is why i hang out with people who are not normal to, but again who sets the standards for normal?? Friends should be treasured and loved for you might lose them in a heart beat. This would have been a great quote for my group a few months ago cause everyone was fighting over some very stupid things, I dont even remember what it was over but now it is finished and I am glad because I think it just adds pressure to everyone when no one is getting along. Well I dont know if I have anything else to talk about now but if I come up with something later, I will write!! laters ~ashley~

      Friday night, Saturday to sleep in, and Sunday to sleep all day before school starts. :( It really does suck that this is the last weekend of my summer vacation. I did not accomplish anything that I wanted to this summer. I had so many goals set and they just all slipped away, but oh well what can I do now. I just set my goals for the last year of highschool. I dont know about anyone else but i am kind of freakin out about this being the last year. Moving away actually having to pay for school but I guess that will pass. After this year it is off the the real world. Laters for now. ~ashley~

We went to the pit tonight and coulter and matt ride the tire that is on the back of the jeeps and we go over this hill and both of them are like one handed screaming and everything it was sooo funny but then erika got stuck in the mud and matt finally got to drive erikas jeep but the point of the pit is... i dont know. Is it to get stuck in mud? or to watch people get hurt? or is it to have fun going over hills and ruining your car? If you know the answer leave a comment lol if anyone ever reads this haha but anyways gtg laters ~ashley~

Even though it does suck I am excited about seeing everyone and getting back into swimming so I can start to loose the weight I gained over the summer lol (can we say fat??) lol. Oh well, and I didnt even accomplish any of the goals I set for the summer but oh well lol. I say that way to much. So I dont know what else to say, 'cept laters!!! ~ashley~

      The color red is very interesting. I was reading somewhere that men have a harder time distinguishing various colors of red, but women can distinguish all kinds of red. This is because women have a certain gene on each of thier chromesomes and men only have one. This is why men are more likely to be color blind. Even in the days when we were hunters and gatherers women needed to detect the diferences between poisiones berries and edable berries, two different reds. And it is a good thing men did not have to do that or we might not even exist lol. Thought this was interesting and I thought I would share it with who ever reads this. ttyl ~ashley~

      I was reading through some other peoples stuff and I thought about the game chubby bunnies. Do you remember when you were a kid at camp (if you went lol) you would play chubby bunnies? Well if you have never played the game, you shove marshmallows or something soft and squishy in you mouth, and then try to say chubby bunnies. Who ever can shove the most marshmallows into you mouth and still say chubby bunnies, wins. It is a very funny game to play with your friends when you are at camp lol. Just thought I would share this though with the people who might read this.  ~ashley~

      I was reading some stuff on human memory. We have 2 types of long tirm memory;episodic and semantic. Episodic memory is our memeory of events that take place in our lifes. These memories help us bring back any moments in our lifes. Semantic memory is our memory that tells us what we have learned and what we retain. It helps us learn from our past experiences so we can learn new concepts. This interests me very much. I dont really know where I am going with this but I dont want to remember any of what has happened with all my so called friends in like the past summer. Very bad memories. Well that is enough of the memory stuff for now. later. ~ashley~

       is pointless. You do the same thing from day to day, week to week, just to get money but i guess that is a good enough reason to do it. I could never be a lawer. Their jobs are sooo boring and bland I could never do it. Well I am off to lunch then back to the same old same old. Blah. ~ashley

      is wierd sometimes. You never really know what is going to happen next, unless you are truly God. This can be a good thing sometimes but other times it can be horrible. You can ruin you life with one sentence, word, even one look. LIfe is random. Life isnt long, so take it slow,and not too seriously, you'll never get out alive. I like that saying. LOL. Well i guess that is enough from me.  ~ashley~
