      hello,     Greetings! Do you know why you are here? You probably know what caused u to come here... but do you know WHY you came?  You had a choice, and you chose to come to this site...well now that you are here, you are almost certain to come back. Why? becuause you will choose to becuase you will see what its like to pry into a mind as strangely assembled as mine.  I can say what I want and how I want.  First lets give you some background info on who I am... exactly? Name: Phil Novoa (the franchise) age: 16 Occupation: CHS JR. and three time class president due to the good hearts of those in control of democracy, the people hobbies: chillin with my friends, my JEEP, music, working out, bein presidential like, family, my awesome brother who is almost as unique as i am...almost, and finally but not least... JESUS (walks).. desires in life: be happy, live day to day, live the best i can well i hope this introduces you at least, trust me, youll find out much more... much more!! this isnt excitin quite yet! Now what is the purpose and why am I writing this? because i believe that this is a good way to say whats on my mind to those who care! ill be writing on everything from my life to music to the lakers to lyrics that me and travis (killa T) come up with (oh..we will!!) to whatever else randomly pops out.. cuase if it comes from the heart... then it must be true, ya heard me?

      Im not going to lie.&nbsp; i forgot about this whole blog thing.&nbsp; but its funny cuz the whole month i didnt write anything i actually was thinking of material that could be used for something like this.&nbsp; i was also thinking, no one is going to read this, but then agian i dont care because its a place to say whatever i want and that idea intrigues me.&nbsp; So here is the first post: My pet peeve: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has one. mine completely drives me insane. its something simple, but i feel i am lenient when it comes to it.&nbsp; my pet peeve is when people do not return calls that i leave them, and im talking about me leaving a message as well,... in fact, i leave MULTIPLE messages for this one particular person (who said for me just to call the next day).&nbsp; i dont know why, but it just bothers me. i consider it rude in fact.&nbsp; disrespectful. ignorant!!!! oh well. lets just say i found other things to do than talking to these people, especially that ONE person.&nbsp; their loss, im positive.&nbsp; HA, then this ONE person has the nerve to call me like 3 weeks later asking if i did some insane thing to her car i dont even remember what she said. I was like what the hell?! hello? how are YOU doing? by the way, thanx for returning my damn messages, all 3 of em. i forgot people are too busy in the SUMMER to pick up a phone and return a 3 second phone call, and this person has time on thier hands i KNOW it, i know this person hangs with people and what not, not like shes swamped in plagues of work and sport.&nbsp; haha so i was like i cant believe THIS... THIS is what you called for, and i hung up, and a week later STILL havent heard from her... i mean this person... oh well I DONT CARE. if this person wants to talk they can call and leave me messages but i can guarantee you i wont be rude and not return the damn things. i dont know why but that just drives me insane, maybe just this ONE case...but anyway it doesnt bother me anymore that i wrote about it. this blog thing is the shiznat! i think me and killa T defenetely need to write a song about this, he feels my pain as well.&nbsp; in fact it seems like the old "crowd" of certain ppl feel they are too high up to return phone calls.&nbsp; you know what, we found ourselves some new recruits, and now you can do the dialing... and NO IM NOT AN ANGRY PERSON!!! but this is a pet peeve im talking about!
