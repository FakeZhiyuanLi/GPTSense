       hey all,     &nbsp;   today was an okay day.....i went to a karate class even though i am not suppose to     &nbsp;   it wasn't bad at all because it was jus a sword class and even though afterward my foot was huge and swollen it was better than sitting around the house doing nothing     &nbsp;   after sword class i stayed for the belt testing and it was fun..i haven't been to one of those in like forever...it's kinda sad that i am excited about that ...maybe not ; )     &nbsp;   ANYWAY.....my friends pasted and they have their new red belts with brown stripes i was soo excited for them.&nbsp; so congrats SHANNON and KRISTIN!!!!! WAHOO!!!!!     &nbsp;   after the test i saw my old friend matt who i haven;t seen in like forever...he is SOOOO busy at work that today was his only day off since summer started...so it kinda stunk    &nbsp;  later on kristin came over and i taught her how to play "tail" (in polish it sounds kewler but it still means tail)    &nbsp;  she liked the game and i learned dutch blitz and i like that game even though i am not that good at it.    &nbsp;  well.....later on i had dinner which was sooo yummy    tomorrow&nbsp;shannon it flying off to Hawaii and i think that&nbsp;is soo unfair best i wanna go but what can i do&nbsp;    alright i am going now because i am tired ...working tomorrow ewwww &nbsp;

      TODAY WAS SOOOO FUN!!!!!!   i woke up way to early in the morning but other than that it was fun.   I went out to my friend lizzy's house to see my friend zak who moved away but came backfor a visit. it was sad because he DIDNT REMEMBER ME!!! after a while he seemed to remember who i was so that was good.   we all went to pirates cove and then didn't stay long...we went to see a girl named karen( i don't know her)&nbsp; she worked there.&nbsp;   after pirates cove we went to walgreens to buy some cameras for a remeberance stuff.   we went back to lizzzy;s house and hung out for a while....my mom called on my cell and asked where i was..she said she couldn't hear me she i repeatede being a lizzy's like a million times then she was like oh ok bye then...affter like an hour my dad called and did the same thing.   after a few hours we ordered pizza and it was fun....then we played spoons ..i was REALLY good or atleast i like to think so..   so then i left and got home and called my best friend shannon...she came over we hung out and then i had to go to work...   some people (costomers) are dumb and they were horrible to deal with today.   after work i went to get shannon becuase she is sleeping over. we went to see I, ROBOT and it was good i dont know what some people are taking about.   ok well that's all....i have to go now!!!1   BUH BYE ALL   LYLIMT

         hey,   this is my first entry....kinda wierd   well...just resently i started physical therapy on my right foot.   well, just before i started karate in like 5th grade i had surgery to remove an extra bone becuase it hurt a ton. well......unfortunatly it GREW BACK. didn't know that could happen. so it hurts again after like 7 years of no pain.   so we went to doctors and they said surgery is a short term and therapy is a long term solution. so we are giving it a try.   if it don't work then i will have surgery and be out for like another 6 weeks of no karate!!!   already bummed about it and feeling really lazy so trying to lift weights at home but it is soooo boring. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   i have been trying to get shannon to come and wieght lift with me but she won't.   &nbsp;  i have a new summer job. i have been working there for like a month now actually. every one at Culver's (where i work) is kewl. one guy kinda freaks me out because he is touchy feely guy and normally i am fine with that if i have know u longer than a week and&nbsp; i only see u every two to three days of that week. so he is weird.(no he is not gay like my friends have asked)   ok well i have to get up early for tomorrow so goodnight all!!!
