          I want to live in France.  They are trying to ban SUVs in Paris because they pollute, cause accidents, and take up too much space.  Politicians in France begged the question, "why would one want to drive a caricature of a car?" Culture vs. Consumption. Quality vs. Quanity. Life vs. Waste.     Over-fed, brand-toting Americans who worship young teenagers with huge bank accounts are baffled to why anyone wouldn't want to drive SUV.  Covet the consumer, they keep Bush in office, as they did Reagan. Lacoste is back.  Neon pumps are too.  Coke and meaningless sex was never as cool. Madonna's re-animated corpse is back.  Demi Moore's snagglepussy is snatchin' around too.       Where is the hell is there a Judd Nelson these days? Can Clay Aiken OD on Diet Pepsi and Gap cargos? Hopefully in Christopher Lowell's lap.      Who the hell is Aaron Carter, why is he famous?  Oh, because his brother was in boy band.  Is he Marky Mark without the funky bunch and over-hyped body and face?  I think he is more of a Corey Feldman bound to get married on a reality TV show in white knickers.  But for now his fame goes with question and probably condoms.         When is Kelly Osborne going to be destitute on heroin and get hit by an SUV?       I want this circus to be over.  To other countries America must look like it is run by a money hungry carnie.

      Bill Clinton said Hillary made him sleep on the Presidential Couch because of his cheating heart. Presidential Couch my ass. He peaced to entirely different wing.  The one where Hillary brought runaway girls and loose corporate wives. She didn't care, and I don't care.    Does anyone have footage of Bush choking on a pretzel and falling on a glass table? Or how about him reading a book ABOUT A GOAT when planes were crashing into buildings?   Let's get back to relavent issues.  Enough with the careless Clintons.

      I got to fight for my right to vomit all over myself. Last night I watched a TRL tribute to the Beastie Boys.      I thought they were on a mountain, with a goat, trying to free Tibet and repent for their sins of misgynistic, lewd, bagel-loving lyrics.  NO, I WAS SO WRONG.  They were right here, in the BEST city in the world, New York City. They were in Times Square- art, music, and sprituality capital of THE world.  What where they doing, you ask.  Well.... they fit all three of their ailing bodies into matching outfits and rapped a little more wackness into the world.  Not just any outfits,  standard issue gray pants with white striped shirts.  Standard imprisoned America look. Yet, they daringly capped off with matching cocked to the side trucker hats and coked out sunglasses (yes, at night).  You might as well have gone to the Gap because you look like a bunch of pediphiles anyway, yo.  Drugged up gay pediphiles.      You soiled yourself.  Nobody wants to see you when the parties over.  You were Regan's illegimate jew party children who stole the black mans music and made a mockery of responisibility.   Your the reason everybody's credit sucks.  Reagan is dead and you should be too.

      Well, here I am, in Union Square, New York City, New York. Wow one of the most exciting cities in the world. Donald Trump, caviar, helicopters, secret passages between buildings.      Today my boss yelled at me cause two guys at work were "taking far too many shits in the bathroom."  He continued, "I am tired of them coming in and taking shits in the bathroom.  Tell them to stop."  I asked if I could say the word dump or doodie instead.   He said a dump or a doodie doesn't take a half hour.  "Taking shits in my bathroom stops or you stop working here." So I put a sign up on the bathroom "No More Crapping as per management. Please crap elsewhere."  I hope one of them has diarrhea on his desk.

      Listen, this is not a topic I enjoy.  Last night at Key Foods I saw Teenpons.  Tampons specifically made for teens.  And according to the cartoon on it is JUST FOR teens (of all ethnicities) who play soccer and cheerlead.  I had to wonder, did scientist design a tampon specifically made for virgins?      Does this mean old tampons that weren't designed for teen virgins took my virginity in Pearl River High School bathroom after 5th period.  I am fucked.
