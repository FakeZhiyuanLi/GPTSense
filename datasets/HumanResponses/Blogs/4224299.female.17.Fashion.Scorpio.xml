      hmmm.....this has been a very busy and tiring day for me...our whole RLE group stayed in Krissy's house last night just to finish all the stuffs and by 7:30 am we had our case presentation and we're lucky because Ms. Reyno is in good mood...(kahit na ang gulo ng presentation!) in fairness, yung case namin super challenging! hehehe...after that, jen, macy, karol,yana, tom, mike, seth, maycon and I ate lunch together....  -=:shei-shei:=-

       it has been a relief for me because the classes were suspended today...I was able to have a straight 8 hours sleep (which I don't usually attain in regular days!)....but still I'm so busy with my NCA...(for those who don't know about it...Its a case analysis of my patient during my Related Learning Experience) and it was already due on WEDNESDAY...argh!....I'm not yet ready for that...how I wish my clinical instructor will be considerate enough to move it next week.....      anyway....enough of that....I just want to relax even for just a little while...that's why I surf the net instead of reviewing tons of chapter in my Pharma book....maybe I can still rush on reading it in the morning....      so...i'm glad I was able to chat with my friends...its really been a long time.....    I was able to talk with my friend ryle...hmmm...I was not expecting that he will open up a topic like "modeling" ...but then, he did....      he was asking if I had an experience in modeling before, particularly in ramp modeling....sigh!....I thought it was just a joke....yet its true....I told him that I didn't have any experience in ramp modeling but I was once able to be a SLIGHT image model for a campaign ad.....I also told him that I was just 5'4" and it is obviously not accepted....but then he told me that my height is not really important ...what important is the way I walk and well of course...my creativity....and he gave me until the end of the month to prepare my stuffs like the personal data, pictures, etc....he also oriented me about the screening....      i'm still undecided if i'm going to join...      I need to ask for other people's opinion...hmmmm   ......"di tuloy ako makatulog sa pag-iisip....."       hay...whatever.....
