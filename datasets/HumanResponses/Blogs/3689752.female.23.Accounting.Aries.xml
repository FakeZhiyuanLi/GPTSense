						    urlLink Inanna's Witchy Ways.  I know how this woman feels mostly. I hate having people assume that I know nothing because I am young, especially in the subject of the occult. Nothing pisses me off more than some wiccan fluff bunny coming up to me, preaching to me. Well maybe one thing pisses me off more...liars. Liars are scum. When someone lies it says they don't have the balls to tell the truth.

       Just so completely not done on purpose, but I noticed something somewhat freaky. I viewed my blog real quick and I was looking at the pretty posts and their colors, and realized that the posts that refer to him are green! Just odd, and freaky.

        I had a conversation with him.  It was a very stimulating conversation. We talked about some of the problems that were obvious with the chatters. Not a couple of random off the handle jabs at their person, but more of a carefully studied and calculated approximation of why they were there. Funny enough we both came up with about the same things, just worded differently. We talked about some of our opinions on the world. Sometime before I had to wake up my girl we got a little more serious. Along the lines of why I like him. Sometimes he comes across quite blunt, borderline mean about some tings. I just figured out why he does, with me at least. I know why he is that way towards others. I believe he gets as harsh as he does to see if he can shake me, to see if I am just playing. Well thats the best I can think of how to word it. I am patient and don't take it personally. I answer his questions honestly and as best as I can. Many times words fail me. It gets frustrating when words fail me. I don't feel like I am conveying my thoughts and feelings clearly. I suspect that he understands what I was trying to say. He is more than pleased that I answer all of his questions. And that I do so honestly. Sometimes shyness trips me up. I truly enjoy his intellect. His mind and thought process are most appealing to me. Kind of like setting out a dish of the finest cheeses to a conisiour. He rounds it out with a wicked sense of humor. A cutting one if you will. A very intellectual humor, and that is something I cherish. He thinks he isn't funny, but he shouldn't be allowed to judge ourselves. We are our own worse critic. Quite often we look for things to tear down, we force ourselves to find something wrong where there is nothing. His personal morals are quite high. He has his own opinions formed by himself. Not forced upon him from an outside force. They are ironclad. Held firm within his very being. I respect that. He has so much of my respect. I don't know if he will know how much I truly respect him. I have come to some profound discoveries. Ones that are deeper than I had once thought. It is most essential that someone fulfills deep needs in you. Needs that you can only discover through thorough searching. I must have someone that makes me laugh, and not just at "fart" jokes. I need someone that stimulates my mind, and makes me think. I need someone that is willing to hear my point of view, and not tell me it is wrong. I need someone that understands that I feel hurt, and maybe there isn't anything they can do about it but be patient. It probably isn't their fault. I need someone that understands that I am not perfect, but treats me as though I am. I need to feel needed, wanted, desired. Probably in that order, and not overbearing in any of those areas. Someone that can see through my mask. The smile isn't always real. It just catches me off guard when it is seen through. To know what feelings or thoughts are residing under that mask. I don't know who or what I am yet. I only know part. Nothing is more rewarding than someone that can see from the outside, peeking in at what lies there. Give me a different perspective, maybe more clarity. I should know who I am. But I don't. My entity was nearly destroyed. I am once again coming out of my cocoon, but not as before. I am harder, scars run deeply. Maybe someday those scars will fade as the ones on my skin have. I think I have found that. We will see. Only time can tell. I have dreams about him. Nothing too special, but in their way they are special. Slowly dancing in the living room, in the darkness. Who knows if there is music, I like to think so. It wouldn't matter, but it would be nice. Smiles as I express my individuality by making my hair snow white with muted blue streaks. Arms holding me as I cry at night, as I often do that. I hate crying at night. I hate falling asleep with tears on my cheeks. One day it will stop. I hope. I don't know. I don't like to be alone. I have been alone mostly for the past five and a half years. Surrounded, but alone. Trapped. There are times now that I don't feel alone, even when physically I am. I feel as though someone is there with me. Kind of in the room, but not quite. Perhaps its just a matter of distance. I don't expect anyone to understand my ramblings. On this I am not looking for understanding, just acceptance. I had a little voice of fear and cowardess creep in as I contemplated posting this. All of this has been sitting in the storage banks of my mind for a couple of months now. I am terrorfied to let this out for the world to see. What if the person that makes me think reads this? Surely he will know it is he I write about. I do not doubt that he would know. Now my cowardess is gone. If he reads this, and some part of me hopes he does, maybe he will understand me better. These things aren't easy for me to convey. I have been proof reading this and making edits to it all for the longest time. I feel confident that it would be a welcome peek beneath my mask, with a flash light and a map.

       Boy what a day. I didn't sleep last night. I was nervous. I was afraid that I would sleep in, and my girl would be late or even miss school. I was worried that we wouldn't be able to find the yellow line with her teacher holding the green sign. I was worried that all kinds of things would go wrong. Of all the silly things I was worried that I wouldn't find the school.  Needless to say I did have reason to worry. We rode with Danielle. Mainly to save on cars added to the traffic jam. We didn't have any problem finding the school, which was a silly worry. However we did have a hell of a time finding the yellow line with their teacher holding the green sign. Once we finally found the right yellow line there weren't any kids there. They hadn't passed us in the hall and by the time we got back inside we headed for the class. Somehow they had managed to get from the yellow line outside to the classroom with out passing us. At last the girls were settled into the class. My girl was all up for fitting in and helping out. Dani's girl wasn't quite having the whole fitting in thing. We managed to sneak out so as to not upset the girls. When I got back home I had a chance to reflect. For years I was put down by the very dipshit that tore down my self image when I was little. My ideas brushed aside as if they meant nothing. My opinion was something that was best kept to myself. My ideals were shunned. My very core beliefs were attacked and he would make me feel shame for them. The dipshit dismantled nearly every fiber of my being. It wasn't right for me to feel hurt when he mistreated me. It wasn't okay for me to feel violated when he strayed. It was downright wrong for me to be the one who was right. It didn't matter if I was right, I was made to feel bad because I was right. Even if I didn't make it known that I didn't agree with what he was doing he found a way to make me the bad guy, without me stating or acting once that he was not doing what was right. I was made to feel horrid for suspecting his faithfulness to our relationship. I shouldn't be attractive to the other sex, because that was wrong. I was to be plain, even ugly. I have been fighting hard to reclaim what of me is left. The hurt is there, the anger is there. But it isn't directed at the dipshit, but at me. I shouldn't have let him change me, I should have fought harder. I should have left sooner. I feel so stupid for not listening to that ever shrinking voice inside of me. It said that things were not right. I wonder if the dipshit were here now if I were to be still living. I think back on the multiple times I wanted to end it all. I tried several times. I can't even begin to imagine how many pills I swallowed by the fistful. I can't imagine how many times I tried. Pain erupts from these memories. When I didn't die, but slumbered peacefully I felt a great deal of shame. I wasn't even able to do that right. I wasn't able to do anything right. I wonder if I am now able to do anything right. Goddess please! I cannot afford to see him again, I cannot afford to have him near me or my daughter! With him not around I feel like myself once again, not fully myself, but getting there. If he were to come back I don't know how many times I could fail before finally attaining success. Hot tears roll down my face just thinking about it. I cut myself a couple of times. A small fletchette on my inner thighs. Why did my blood clot so fast? Why did I fail? Another time with a hunting knife, this time my arms. Deep cuts. Again the blood clotted! Why was this happening? Why in the name of all that I hold holy could I not leave him in this manner? I had tried to leave him physically. I packed up and tried to walk out one night. I grabbed my baby, and my bag. I would make it. I was six feet from the door. He should be asleep. I should be fine. I can do it. Fuck. He is in the hallway. He is coming for me, fast. I run for the door. He tackles me. He takes the baby from me. He kicks me while I am on the ground, hard. Pain shoots through my chest. Things black for a moment. Suddenly he is back. He has put the baby in the crib, she is safe I think. He rips the bag off my back and starts hitting me with it. I don't feel it anymore. I close my eyes tight and wait for me to lose consciousness. Another time in that apartment. He had been three hours late picking me up from work. I wasn't allowed to accept a ride home from my coworker Derek, he was male. It was cold and I was wearing a long sweater and thin leggings. I was freezing. Finally he pulled up. He had some stupid carnations, he knows I hate them. He hands them to me. I take them from him. The feeling that this wasn't a good sign slowly growing. He handed me a large box. He had a gift for me. A stupid plastic set of kitchen utensils. Why was he giving me gifts? What was his game? Slowly we headed home. I asked him why he was so late, why I didn't get a call. He grabbed the flowers from me and hit me with them. Quickly a closed right fist hit me in the stomach hard. I didn't talk the rest of the way home. If I were to cry who knew what would happen to me. His driving was scary when he was mad. I didn't want to risk it. Not with the baby in the car. Walking to the door to our apartment I whimpered. I slid the key into the lock and promptly had my head hit against the door. Warm blood trickled down my forehead. No noise. No noise. No noise. Go inside and put the baby to bed. Go into the bathroom and lock the door quietly. Get the first aid kit and look at my head. Sticky hair matted to the area. Alcohol pads clean the area. A band aid placed over the cut and I was okay. I bent down with some pain to put away the first aid kit. Something in the cupboard wasn't right. There was something there that didn't belong. A false back, white cardboard. Behind the cardboard my worse nightmare. The reason he was late. I wasn't the only one for him. My heart breaks into thousands of little pieces and they begin to diminish into a black puddle. I am looking through the pills. There they are. Lortabs. Tylenol 3 with codeine. Tylenol. Ibuprofen. The cup on the sink. I begin to fill it with a mixture of pills. I pour as many as I can in the cup.  I take a handful. He is kicking down the door. I only manage to swallow a few. Six or more, I don't know. He is hitting me, making me release the cup and drop the pills. Hundreds of them pour on the floor. He drags me out by my hair. The corner of the dresser hits my shoulder. He grabs something off the dresser and throws it at me. It bounces off me and hits the door jam. It breaks. I know what it was. The lid to my grandma's little jewelry dish. Rage floods my body. I grab the other half of the dish. I was going to throw it at him. I don't know what happened. My hand is badly cut. I can see the bone under the flesh. No hospital for this stupid wife. There isn't any pain. I pack the wound with cayenne and wrap it in cloth. I press it hard to stop the flow of blood. Barry is screaming at me. I don't know what he is saying. I go sit on the couch, holding tightly to my hand. I don't remember what happened next. Do I want to? The things I can't quickly recall seem to be the worse. I don't want to know. Please Goddess don't let me remember. I couldn't handle what my mind has seen fit to block out. Shortly there after I dream of his death. He is in a war. he is shot under the vests opening for the arm. The bullet is hotter than anything I have ever felt. I have seen this dream before. He has died in this dream before. When was it? That first night. I know when I had this dream first. I knew his fate before we were engaged. Maybe thats why for the longest time I fought so hard against him going active. Maybe thats why I looked so hard for a way for him to leave the reserves. At that time of the first dream I refused to see it, I refused to allow him to become a part of that dream. That second time I had that dream I knew what it was saying. He must go active duty army. He must. That is what was fated for him. I next had the dream when he was coming here to Texas. I have lots of dreams, more often than not they are more than dreams. They are glimpses of the past, future or present. You don't want to see some of the things I have seen in the past or present. But I was able to confirm the horrors I saw before my eyes. Bit by bit every part of me that loved him and cared for him died away, like some doomed plant. The plant was completely dead and decomposing when he last beat me. As he choked me, he sped up the decomposition process of that plant that was once love. I felt no more for him. No hate. No love. Nothing.   For my dear friends. Please don't hate me for not telling you any of this. I didn't mean to keep it locked away so long. I was more afraid to let it out. I was afraid that you guys would hate me for being weak enough to let him

       I haven't been to sleep yet. I just wasn't tired. But I do think the time was spent nicely. I did get more than a few good laughs. Plus its always nice to have sweet nothings whispered in your ear, even if its in another language other than your native tongue. I understand enough to get the gist. Plus all the bits I don't know get explained. Nothing that would be improper for children to hear, just sweet things. Makes me feel all stupid and giddy. I don't know. I guess I am more used to not being appreciated, and put down. It's more than nice to have someone that likes and appreciates you, and more importantly lets you know. I have friends that let me know they appreciate me, but its not the same. It's just different. I was starting to feel horridly fat and ugly. Then last night I switched on my cam for him. I was drunk, but clothed. I had to keep getting up to get another drink, or go to the bathroom. I would pause the cam before I got up, one of the things I do when I am feeling ugly and fat. I forgot to pause it once. His reaction was one of awe. He has seen me stand before. I guess that it was better this time because he hadn't seen me for so long. I just felt so good about myself. Kind of like butterflies erupting from their cocoons in my stomach. Most people think this guy is a jerk. I don't think he is a jerk. Just well educated about things. He is nice enough to me, but then again lots of people think I am a bitch. I can get pretty mean about people that don't know stuff and act like they do. He thinks for himself. I like that. He doesn't just go with the crowd. He doesn't judge me either, not for the "bad" stuff I have done. Although he does call me a mix between Martha Stewart and a serial killer, can't remember which one. It makes me laugh, because I probably am. It's cute. I am by far the oddest person I know. I would probably suggest an asylum for me if I met myself. One part of me is sure that he wouldn't ask about the dimensions of the sexual organs of previous lovers, then get pissed off an call me a whore. It's not like I sought them out for size and technique. I dated them because they had interesting personalities. They treated me nicely and had that little something that made a part of me somewhat happy. They had respect for my boundaries. I liked them, and they pursued me. Like any relationship between a man and a woman, or any sex partnering. They wined me and dined me. They took their time to woo me like I should be wooed. They didn't just drop trow and show me their piece and hop in the sack. Thats not how I work. They mentally seduced me, then physically. I shouldn't be called a whore because one boyfriend had a large dick. I shouldn't be called a whore because he had lovely red curly hair. I shouldn't be called a whore because he took me on the best dates I have ever been on. I shouldn't be called a whore because I didn't give it up to him for six months. I didn't ask to see his piece first then start dating. Quite honestly; he scared the crap out of me when I first saw him naked. I had never so much as seen an uncut penis until then. Let alone a penis of that size on anything human. I didn't suck his dick or anything, or take it in the ass, or even fit the whole damn thing in me. What the fuck am I getting called a whore for? How would men feel if they were called a whore if they slept with a woman that had a large clit? Jesus Fucking Christ. I answered his fucking question truthfully because he asked, if he didn't want to know he shouldn't have asked. I am not going to lie. I have more balls than to lie. If you really don't want to know, don't fucking ask. It is as simple as that. And by all means don't get mad when you get an honest answer. What the fuck was I supposed to do? See the size of him and say,"I can't have sex with you, your dick is too big. You kiss like a fucking god, you have the oral skills of a lesbian, I am hornier than shit but I won't have sex with you because future partners may have a huge problem with the size of your penis." Yeah fucking right. That would be fucking committable. Lock you away in a loony bin for saying that kind of shit. It's not like it is easy to get me into bed. I was called a fucking ice queen for fucks sake! I didn't give it up to many. Ehh fuck it. Enough ranting of offenses generated by an asshole. I am not here to bitch about that shit, at least not right now. So back to the subject. Oh yeah. Now I remember. It was the neatest thing, we talked about the bible. I just about died laughing. His knowledge of the bible is fucking amazing. I am not Christian, and I practically hate Christians, but I love to talk about the bible. Some of it just cracks the shit out of me. If you take things from the legal stance it is quite humorous. Like for instance; if you have enough goats to kill and crops of wheat to burn you can get away with just about anything. I just about died laughing over that. There is also the whole bit where they are instructed to go out and rape and pillage! Now what if you have to rape and pillage your neighbor and his wife? What happens then? You kill three goats and burn a weeks worth of grain. LMMFAO. Then there is the whole ten commandments part, I love this little bit...The ten commandments were written for the Jews that were there with moses, worshiping the golden calf. Right? Right. So they apply to the Jews that were there, and their children. Any further generations and outsiders should be excluded. Look at it from a lawyer's stance. So all these people running around are not following the proper set of laws. It took us a good hour or so to talk about this stuff, I just condensed it. We talk about weird shit like that all the time. It just cracks me up. I love it. I like it when my mind is stimulated. I could go on for hours about the bible. I have done lots of research on this subject because it fascinates me. Oh, and bible knowledge isn't where it stops with him. He has a vast collection of subjects that he is knowledgeable on. Like psychology. I love psychology. We sit and annalize people. Its just great. His knowledge on the Goddess and her many facets is amazing. I usually have to explain the lesser known Goddess's to people. One day He knew who Dana was. My jaw hit the fucking floor. I was so amazed. Knowledge turns me on, and not just sexually. He knows about my Goddess! I love it. I don't have to explain about The Morrighan. He even backs me up on stuff about her. I fucking love it. Oh God, the man knows about Astrology! Not just the typical shit that some people know. His knowledge is really in depth. He has genuinely studied it. Just a big fucking WOW. Most people that say they know about astrology just know some about their sun sign. Blah, blah, fucking blah. They couldn't plot their birth chart if their life depended on it, let alone translate the fucking thing. All they know is shit like: I am a Taurus. The Bull. I like food, camping, friends, and long walks on the beach. More or less fucking morons in the subject. It is like telling a dentist that teeth are in the mouth. Do they know anything else? No, of course not. For crying out loud, so many people just annoy the shit out of me. Like the ones that try to tell me something in my area(s) of expertise. Give me a fucking break. He knows what drives me insane. He helps me cope with it. It always makes me feel great when he backs me up on something. Always. Like I am on top of the fucking earth. He stands up for me. I really like that. I cannot stand a man who will allow someone to talk shit about their love interest, or mate. Nothing is more cowardly. Nothing, except rape. Which he despises. Death would be better than rape. He stands up for me, and tells others to fuck off. Unlike others have in the past. A certain someone would allow people to trash talk me and say nothing to stop them. That is sheer ingratitude if you ask me. I am not a bad person, and most of the trash was rumors started by jealous women. This guy wouldn't allow that to happen. He would stand up to them, even if they outnumbered them. I certainly don't allow my love interests to be talked shit about. I stand up and tell them to shut their fucking mouths in front of me. If you allow your mate to be put down by other people it is incredibly disrespectful, I don't care if your mate is a fucking psycho. If you don't care about them enough to stand up and say, "Hey, thats not right," you shouldn't be with them. You don't deserve them. And if you allow other people to make advances on your partner it shows that you don't value them as your partner. It shows that you don't care if someone else wants to take them from you. I don't need anyone to protect me, but it is sure nice to know that I am protected even if I don't need the protection.  I am more than capable of telling asses to fuck off. Okay I am fucking mush, my brain needs to shut the fuck up. I need to nap a bit. There isn't any reason for me to be up still. No one to talk to right now. The Sweet Nothings in my ear have gone to bed, I might as well go that way too.

       More than slightly intoxicated and very giggly, it took me forever to find this site.    Today was fairly good. Got to meet the teacher at Ravyn's school. I feel utmost pity for the woman. One classroom, twenty four year olds, one teacher. Doesn't sound like fun to me.    I finally got online today, and let the rest of my friends know that I was living.    It was nice. I would type more, but I am passing right the fuck out in my chair.

       I really need a chiropractor that is good. I know of one, but he is in Utah. I have seriously contemplated calling him, setting an appointment and going on a magical mystery tour to find him. Then I can fold him up and put him in a suitcase and take him everywhere. Muhhahhahahahaha and stuff.   Same odd dream last night but it is as if I had a horrible commercial run through the middle of it. It was some one screaming that Archie was dead, me thinks the voice could have been his sweetheart of a wife Cassie. That would suck if he died. He's a nice guy.    Today has been "Catch the piercings on everything" day. I am fucking sore from all the snags that happened. But don't even think for one second that I am going to get rid of them. I love them when they aren't getting snagged to shit on things.    Got a new cd today, type o's Life is Killing Me. I love it so far.  Having seen what I have seen makes listening to them even more of a treat. But thats my evil, sex deprived mind at work. Ha ha ha ha ha. Good thing no one is here to slap my hand for such thoughts. I think that I would have bruises on my hands if any of my good friends were here. I swear that if I were to just think lovely little thoughts about how cute Collin Farrel's butt is I would have broken skin on the back of my hand. Well now that I need a bib to catch the drool I should change the subject.      Oooh! I dyed my hair again. It is now a lovely "cherry cordial" with lovely highlights. It looks fucking cool. The under part is still black, and I doubt that will change anytime soon unless I bleach it out. Black is wonderful for staying in my hair. And with the layers it looks fucking cool as shit.    Doobie doobie dooo, I am bored as shit. I should be in bed trying to sleep, but I just don't feel like it. Damnit. Evil thoughts of getting my binoculars out and see whats going on in the park behind my house. Ha ha.I love some of the gadgets my mom sends home  . I got all sorts of nifty stuff from her today. Its kind of funny, I was on the phone saying how worried that her package hadn't arrived yet when the post man knocked on the door with the huge black box. That there is some fucking timing. I was so happy. I felt like a kid on x-mas. Then I went to my mailbox and got the rest of the mail, and I was even happier. There was another package. One with a new BoB. A loberly lavender colored one, not that you wanted to know that. Ha ha :P.   Thoughts of "I don't need a man" keep running through my head. I have everything I need, well...just about.   Just saying nighty-night to a friend. Seems as though this rabid hornyness isn't just affecting me. He is randier than, well, a bitch in heat too. Hahahahahha. It must be something in the air, or the moon phase, or something.  More than likely it is just that time of the night when only the horny pervs are up. That probably means I should get my happy ass to sleep.  Probably going to pass out watching a movie, maybe Scarface. That should produce some odd dreams.

       I know I didn't spell that right, but it means I am the head cheese (or something like that). Which I believe I am. I am ultra cheesey. I am like Vermont Cheddar glued to Provolone with cheese whiz, and topped with melted velveta and parmasean sprinkles. Yes I am that cheesey.       I am on the phone with my bestest friend Beska. We are rambling about shit that is stress. Stress is annoying, and to help get rid of it you talk about it and some of it goes away. Or some shit like that. Talking to her helps me get some fresh ideas, some good ideas.      I am feeling much better about the subject that was stressing me so much earlier. I heard some disturbing news and didn't quite know what to do, so I called her.  Much like a cool breeze on a hot day my mind was refreshed.       School starts for Ravyn next monday. I am kind of freaked about that. Who would have thought I would have a kid? Let alone one that is old enough to go to school. I certainly didn't. Hell, I wasn't supposed to be able to have kids in the first place. Such a nice suprise it was to find out I was pregnant. I don't know if I want to try any more to have another kid. I have had so many miscarriages that it isn't funny. The latest one was in Febuary.   Oh well.

       I finally got my little brother home from ozzfest. I don't even want to really get into that. I could just kick myself. I could have gone, for free. I didn't think I had a baby sitter, until well after they all left with out me. Anyhow, my brother let the other brother "touch up" his dual Mohawk. He pretty much screwed it up, then tried to cover it up and say it looked "pimp" the way he did it. I had a short discussion with Jacob about how he would like it done, and we came to the decision that he wanted the dual-hawks to come all the way to the back of his head and meet in the back like a big V. So I got out the big and shaved away most the stubble putting in the ground work for the V. When his hair grows more I will taper the front a bit so that it kind of comes to a point near the back of his head. I couldn't remember where I hid the hair cutting scissors or I would have done it tonight. I figure if he is going to be a punk he should look good at it. No offence to the gutter-punks, (I have many friends that are gutter-punks), but my brother isn't going to be one. If he is going to be seen out in public, with me a respectable Goth, he will go with a more classy punk style. I had to buy him more clothes too, he looked really....Um...bad. Now he looks more like me...A menace to society. :D Boy, if my neighbors didn't think I was weird before, they will now. Not that they didn't already...I am the freak down the street that yells at them in the middle of the night.    That reminds me, I need to do a re-dye of my hair. I am sick of the pink and black. Granted it matches my wardrobe. I am contemplating purple, Goddess knows I have plenty of purple clothes. I haven't had my hair purple in ages. Okay, more like six months. I love my hair when it is black with large red chunks, but for some reason that color combo makes more people stare than neon blue or grass green. I am never dying my hair grass green again. I felt like a leprechaun shat on my head.... I do have this lovely peacock blue that looks good. Maybe I will do that.    "Why does she dye her hair funky colors, does she really want to draw attention to herself", you may be thinking, but nope. I have attention from being damn near six feet tall, just a mere inch shy. I get stared at plenty for that. At first I guess I started to dye my hair funky colors because of people staring, now it is purely for my pleasure. I love being able to have some odd color on my hair, and nails. Makes me laugh. A lot of the women down here like to give me crap about it. Funny part of it is they have funky hair too. Like the last one that made fun of my pink hair....Half of her hair was pink, to match her outfit I think. My lovely mean streak made me make fun of her. I told her she was just jealous that it was my real hair, and not some nappy weave. She didn't find it as funny as I did, but I wasn't the only one laughing. There were plenty of oogling guys that found it funny. Then they proceeded to ask me for my number :   Guys piss me off. I have heard the stupidest pick up lines ever. Everything from that stupid "did it hurt?...When you fell from heaven?" to "You should be a model." All I can say to those is, I don't believe in heaven and I was a model, don't want to do that again, I have been dealing with the after effects for a long time. Eating disorders suck. I really think we should do away with the "Twiggy" look, its been something like thirty years....MOVE ON! We should go with that "I am healthy, and won't break in the bedroom" look. Plenty of men out there like the women that have some meat on their bones, the ones that won't freeze to death in the winter as opposed to the other look. Too many people have been hurt by the desire to be an unhealthy skinny size. It is just ridiculous. Models should not be "perfect" and project this image as "perfect", there are just not that many people that look like that (and are healthy  ).    that's my rant on that subject.   As I finish my smoke and indulge my latest craving for massive amounts of Tool I think that perhaps, just maybe I can fall asleep right when my head hits the pillow. I have so much crap to do tomorrow. One thing I am looking forward to is spending some time with my other brother, the one not staying with me. I am going to take him shopping for some clothes. Ugh. I just went over the list of stuff I have to do tomorrow, and it isn't pretty. I have to hit up the gym first thing in the morning, then skip merrily over to walmart and pick up some stuff. Mainly deep cleaner solution to shampoo my carpets. From there I must handle business, get that out of my hair. Pay all the bills, then get back home. The brother staying with me has to go mow Danielles lawn, then my back lawn. I have to fix the pool, and fill it up again. Stupid dog thought it would be fun to put a hole in it. Then I don't remember what. Damnit. At some point I should contact my friends and let them know I am not dead. Maybe I will go pick up that fedora I want. Pin striped. It will go nicely with the skirt or the pants I just picked up. I think I would look cute in a fedora, so do many other people. Oh! I just remembered one good thing about guys hitting on me! I get killer discounts at places. I am evil...I got something like one hundred bucks knocked off cause this guy likes me. I dropped something close to three hundred bucks in their till today. This guy is weird, he has this thing about shoes. He likes to always get me a pair of shoes to try on. I have bought one pair of ankle strap high heels and a pair of knee high 28 hole lace-up boots, and he knows my size. That is just really freaky cause they were in different sizes, European for the boots and American for the shoes. European sizes are a bit different. But none the less he knew my size today. I just wish he was gay, that would be nice. He knows all the clothing I have bought there, cause he is always at the store. He's the manager. It doesn't matter what time I go in, he's there. He tries to show me the newest stuff they have in that he is sure I like. I have this thing for pirate stuff, purple/black, red/black and blue/black, and I have a real bad thing for happy bunny. I like the 50's style stuff and pin stripes. Its absolutely evil if there is something like a lovely dress (50's style) that has red pin stripes and a skull with cross bones some where on it. Its like kryptonite. I go all weak and suddenly my pocket is on fire. I generally hate pink, but sometimes something pink/black will just reel me in. It looks good on me and then I am done for. Its weird, me=freak is a good thing, but for my daughter she looks best all preppie style. Absolutely darling. Needless to say we get some odd looks.    Well hell, I was supposed to be asleep hours ago, and here I am still awake.    I am kicking myself off and going to bed.

       So there I am yacking at Danielle for a few minutes, she brought me flowers. We were talking about how funny it is that Cindy is turning into a fat cow, she made fun of us for our weight. Now me and Danielle are dropping weight like crazy. Our bodies have finally started to respond to our valiant efforts at weight loss and the results are more than welcome. Now Cindy, whom is much shorter than I am and has a small bone frame, weighs a good twenty pounds more than I do. Nothing pleases me more than seeing her get her just desserts. I am thinking me and Danielle will work out together when our kids go to school. It will be nice. I really don't like to work out alone. Oh yeah, back to the subject. My neighbor Carry was getting her lawn mowed by this guy. I guess he comes every two weeks and takes care of her front and back lawn. He offered to mow my lawn. Something I don't really like to do. Its not that I don't actually like to mow my lawn, I do. Its just getting the mower, weed whacker, and all that other stuff to take care of it. I have to drive over to get the stuff, make sure it has gas and then bring it back to my house. Then I have to clean it up and take it all back. Not usually an easy task with a trunk of my size. Putting the mower in my trunk is like pulling teeth. I was going to buy myself a mower, but I had a slight problem...the box for the mower wouldn't fit anywhere in my car. I could tie it to the top of my car, but then I would be all paranoid that it would fall off. The guy just wanted to yack my ear off, it was driving me nuts. I have this horrid feeling he is going to try and hit on me. As if I don't have enough of that. I get sick of getting hit on. It drives me nuts.

       Talking on the phone to Beska, plotting and planning to have her run away from home to come and see me this week. I have a massive headache and need some Dew. I just got back from the store with dew, smokes, and a little bottle of kahlua. I may have to kick people in the ass, for not keeping their promises. It pisses me off to have no money and all kinds of bills to pay, and its not my fault I have no money. I shall be paying off all these bills and setting up a lovely fat savings account for me. Muh hah hah ha.
