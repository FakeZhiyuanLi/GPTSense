       Good Morning!    I was going to attempt to sleep in until 6:30 today, but my dog wouldn't let me.  She is so use to getting up at  5:00 a.m. that she kept pawing at me until I got out of bed.  I think it's funny how she is use to be taking her out in the morning that she doesn't even bother with Mike.  It was a pretty good weekend.  It went too fast, though, as always.  I worked out Saturday and  Sunday both for 30 minutes on the treadmill.  I am going to go work out shortly this morning, too.  I have a doctor's appointment at 11:40, and I need to take my hubbie to work.  Overall, this weekend, eating was good, yesterday was a bit of a splurge.   We met my family in Des Moines and ate at one of my favorite resturants.  I had baked potato soup, a plain baked potato, and a few of the onion rings.  The bad thing is they have bread that is totally awesome.  The thing is I had what I wanted to have, but I didn't really feel like eating it all.  Also, the onion rings, made my stomach hurt last night and pretty much after we got  home, I went to bed.  I felt yucky!  I  probably won't have those for a very long time, now!  I lost a pound yesterday, it looked like it was two, but I didn't want to chance it.  The lines in between, are kinda hard to read.  My mom brought some of the dresses that I wore at different weddings, before I went to bed I tried them on.  That was fun, because they actually fit!  Well, I will sign off for now.  May write more later.

        Friday is over.  It was a stressful day for some reason.  I really didn't rely on food to tackle the stress.  Although, I wish I would have packed something different for my lunch.  After work I was pretty hungary.  I borrowed some from my flex points, which I haven't been using the past few weeks, because I felt that hindered my weight loss before.   I should have done some form of workout tonight, but I am very tired.  For the most part I have been working out five times per week, but this week I have only  exercised twice.  I will get up in the morning and walk on the treadmill.   Well, I am going to sign off for today.

         Welcome to my online journal.  I love to write and I have tried this before, but I thought I would give it another try.  I think before I just ran out of time during the day and just gave up trying to update.  I intend to keep up with this.     A little background on myself . . . I am 27 years old, a college graduate, married, and I have one dog.   We recently moved to a different state, due to my husband's company getting sold.  So, had to look for a different job.   That brought us to our current state.  I have a Bachelor of Science in Education, but I don't teach anymore.  I use to, but the stress got to me right away.  I was having major headaches, tired, and cranky, so I decided to give teaching a break.  I then went to work for a department store, where I got promoted to a Customer Service Trainer, then we moved.  I currently work on pricing  in that same company.  My hubbie is pushing me to use my education to find something more to my liking, but I am okay with what I am doing for now.  I really would like to write, so I have been trying to journal more and that kind of stuff.     Basically, I would like to use this online journal as a place for me to talk about weight related issues.  Ones I have been badly for a very long time.   After I got married, 3  years ago, I weighed around 230 pounds, a few months later I realized I was going into a size 22 and I didn't want that to happen.  I had to do something.  Since, my dh worked late and I worked 12-9 everyday, I would eat two dinners.  One at my actual dinner time at work, and then another one at 9 p.m. on my way home from work.  No wonder I gained a lot of weight!  I went in for a Cardiology appointment(I had open heart surgery when I was 14 mos. old to repair a hole), more reality struck.  He told me I absolutly had to lose weight and get down to 160.  So, here I am, three years later, at 180.  Moving has actually helped me.  I struggled all last year around 200-195 and after we got settled, I rejoined WW getting to upper 180s.  For time sake, and I wasn't getting much from the meetings, I new  WW worked, so I actually joined  WW Online a few weeks ago, and now I sit at 180.  I am very excited that in 20 pounds I will be at goal.        I thought about what actually clicked this time.  I realized this has to be a lifestyle change.  I will have to do this forever.  A few months ago I would have had a problem with that, but not anymore.  I don't like the word diet, this has to be a change forever, it has to become part of me.
