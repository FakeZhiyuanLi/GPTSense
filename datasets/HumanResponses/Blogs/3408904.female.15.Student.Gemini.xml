      Sigh, what do I expect? after going through so much troubles in the school. Felt lost and never able to return back to the past again... Why? Everything seems to be predicted by me in the past.. I did said before, we'll never be together and now we did it.. That hurts alot... Really.. I really hope that we're like in the past and happily facing each and everyday in the school with laughter and fun... Now, everything is impossible.. Time can never turn back to last year... Lost time is never found again...

      Sigh.. I hate my damn sis, she really sucks. Okie, I'm trying not to be biased against her, just that I simply cant stand her way of herself! She thinks that she's right all the time and she thinks that she smart everytime. She thinks that people will see the "perfectness" in her just because she read afew books about upgrading self-attitude. Alright, it seems to help her in her attitutes at times and did change her for a better person. However, books are not forever right or wrong! Books are not updated frequently and I hate her snatching the computer with me saying that I didnt allow her to use the computer and I was on purpose?! She didnt even tell me or ask me that she wanna use the computer, how do you expect I to know? So unfair to me and I felt so unhappy under her control of doing things that I dont like at NIGHT! She has hands and limbs, I'm sure she can do it too, right? Staring right behind my back as if she's watching the television and rudely turning low the volume of my speaker and order me to close the mp3 player? My god, I really dont like this kinda stuff, better get the hell outta here or else I will get a tight slap from her, bye  Sigh off, bLue`iCe

      Hmmm, just as the blog suggested, " Lost Time Is Never Found Again" . Friends are just like that, once friendship is broken between 2 of them, lost time ish never found again... It reflects right on friendships and relationships, I'm not particularly biased against my friends or what. I'm trying to show down here they theory of my quote, I felt very sorrowful ever since the split last year 2003. It has left a deep impact on my friends and my life greatly. Haa, it sounded just like boy-girl relationships, it does leave impact, aint it? Those precious times we spent together were not gonno come back again as enjoyment, instead, it's memories that we have left behind.. Time cannot reverse and put everything back to pieces again especially those precious moments that are important to us. Maybe you felt that this is totally crap but deep in my heart, I'm in dilemma to decide what to do and when to do. This has bothered me every now and then cause I'm not a very open up person, it seems like an easy job for you to make alot of friends in reality. However, to me, it' a tough job to get to know more people as I'm unrealistic...

      Sometimes, things are really not meant for us to decide... Today is my best friend, fen's birthday.. Hmm should I count her as best friend or ex best friend... I'm caught in the middle.. I've bear the pain and gone to the "toughest" time in friendship.. Which almost gone case you see... Happy birthday to Hsiu Fen.. Though I didnt communicate with you.. Deep in my heart, you are always a special friend though you now didnt regard me as one cause of misunderstandings.. Actually today I intend to give up a surprise with a cake and go to your house.. However, as time passes by when I'm in school for band, my hope has slowly dashes as I think that, what will happen if you hate me even more... Pondering again and again just to know a answer.. At last, I didnt do it... I'm sorry.. I can only say this, I really dont know wazzup with you angry with me... I just felt left out all the while and that's why I decided to leave you guys.. Most probably, I still hates her.. Maybe as she enters and I got to be kicked out.. I really dont know.. Anyone can give me a answer? As time passes, I already 'si xin' le... I felt that I no longer treasured by anyone of you in 3E1... you guys just like to left me out and talk alot about results.. That's hurtful to me as I always the last in the class... Guess what, it's all my fault.. How I wish the sweet times together can be back again.. I know that, it's just daydreaming, that day wont come again... :'( Never mind, I already gave up as I cry and cry more last time.. Hmmm Slyvia, happy birthday to you too... hAha.. i rEmember sum of the ex-classmates birthday only! =P sorry~ hAix.. SOrriE.. I really cant make it...

      My Tears Rolled Down My Cheeks My Tears Rolled Down My Cheeks When I Read This Story Accompanied By Sad Songs...  It was first day of the mid-year exams, therefore i finished school a little earlier, i called him, :Hey, i finished school earlier today, would you come by and pick me up? :Alright, give me 5 minutes. :5 minutes? But my school is just beside your house. :I need to get ready. :Alright, make it fast then. 2pm in the afternoon, the sun is extremely hot, I stood under a shaded tree and fan myself. Although it doesn't make much of a difference, it was better that I fanned.  5 minutes have passed, he's still not shown up, I was a lil' unhappy while looking at my watch. 10 minutes and he's still not here....couldn't be that he was met with an accident? 15 minutes passed, he finally shown up.  :Why are you so late? He wasn't even a lil' bothered: Nahz, was watching TV. :What?! TV?! Why don't you sleep, bathe and eat before you come down then? I haven't got anything else to say for that, didn't take the helmet he handed me but stood there and stared at him.  :Sorry.  This was the first time he said sorry to me... He is an egoistical person all along and has never once apologised to a girl.  I looked at him, Alright, took the helmet and let him sent me home. He is always acting like this, no explanations, no friction, no quarrels. The only thing he does is to apologise. To me, somethings can't be settled with a sorry.  I would never go on asking after everytime he apologises.  He told me, that was the first time he said sorry to a girl.  Although it take courage to admit mistakes, he never once correct his mistakes. Saying sorry became a word to shut me up instead.  Tears flowed down my cheek on the 59th time he apologised. I dropped my head: you don't ever need to say sorry to me again. If you can never change, then don't let me keep giving you chances again and again hoping and believing that you would change each time. He held me lightly, and said the 60th sorry. Even then, he did not change, and there was no explanation whatsoever. I began to worry if there was something he was keeping from me. :What's wrong with you these few days?  :Nothing. :Then why are you acting so strange?  :I am not.  :What can you say other than this answer? :Do you know I'm very woried, very insecure,  do you treat me as your girlfriend? :I'm sorry... :I don't want to hear you say sorry again. I put down the phone and he did not call back. He doesn't even care about me. Maybe we should....break up. ....this was the 99th time he said sorry... From that day onwards, I never once called me or went to look for him. Sometimes I get an anonymous phonecall but everytime I said hello, it was dead, i think it's a call from him, but why don't he speak up? After one month have passed, I couldn't contain the feelings I still have for him anymore and went to his school to find him. I went outside his classroom and looked around, but there was no sign of him. :excuse me, is XOXO here today? :I'm afraid he already stopped schooling.  :Huh? Why? When was that?  :He hasn't been in school for a month already.  :Oh erms...thanks. One month....not in school for one month...why is that so? I stumbled home.  Called his hp: Sorry the caller is currently unavailable, please leave your message after the tone.... I put down the phone, and called his house next, but there was no answer. How can it be? The whole family migrated? It seems as though he has already disappeared from the face on the earth leaving not even a single trace.  I couldn't find him....just as I was feeling distraughted, the phone suddenly sounded, it was my friend. He was one of his brothers and also my good friend. :Hey, what have you been doing? XOXO is in hospital. :REALLY? WHAT HAPPENED? :Oh he is in ZZ hospital, the one you stayed in last time. :I'll be right there. I used the fastest speed my legs could carry and when I reached the hospital I saw that his parents were already there. I asked them for the room number and flew across the hall.  He was lying on bed, looking at me, not saying a word, not moving a muscle, :Hey, what happened to you? Why didn't you contact me? He did not answer, and used the same stare on me again. :Come on answer me...why don't you speak? A tear flowed down the side of his eye, and it looked as though he used the greatest amount of strength that he could master to say... :I'm...sorry... After that, his eyes went shut. :Hey, don't fool around alright...why say sorry to me?  :Don't say sorry to me....please wake up....answer me please. I wept and fell down on the side of his bed, pulling his shirt I cried out.. :Why do you have to apologise? Why don't you give me an explanation instead? :I won't forgive you, wake up, saying sorry is no use...  :If you don't wake up I'll never ever forgive you in this lifetime, please I beg of you..open your eyes..... That was the 100th sorry A group of medical staff, doctors, nurses pulled me away and tried to revive him. I had no strength to stand up... My mind was a blank.... my eyes could only see a sea of black. He did not leave this world...I merely lost the chance to touch him anymore. But he would appear in my dreams sometimes, telling me how he was doing. He's still accompaning me, still alive, in my heart.  would still laugh at my silliness, and call me his darling....just that...he never apologise to me anymore. After a month, his mom came to look for me, and gave me a box...inside was a 100 photographs, everyone had a story behind them..the reasons why he made me angry. The first time, my dear, I did not purposely arrive late to pick you up. I know this excuse is really lame, but I didn't have the heart to tell you the truth then, before I stepped out of the house, I felt a pain in my chest, but I still made it a point to meet you, please forgive me? The second time, my dear, I...  The third time, my dear, I... The 100th time, my dear, I didn't mean to leave you alone in this world, It had to be so because God did not give me the chance to say I Love You for this lifetime of mine, and to put the ring on your finger.... You are the first girl I apologised to. And also the first girl I want to be with for the rest of my life... Forgive me for not able to bring you happiness but I have thus become your angel, always looking out for you... Looking at you while you find your happiness...promise me...don't shed a tear... I don't want to see you weep like this for me, I Love You ~XOXO How can I not cry? What you said was just too impossible. The last photograph was of him in the hospital, Although he was skinny, the smile on his face was bright as ever. His face was white and yet he tried his best to give his last smile on the last photo, the 100th. At the time when he needed me the most, I wasn't with him. :I'm sorry. I held the photo tightly and cried for us..... So Guys out there... Explain to your girlfriend... Always...... And girls... understand your boyfriend... Always...

      Lavenders' blue dili dili.. lolx.. dunno how to sing lar.. i'm not a good singer loh.. lolx.. when u r in love with that special someone,you pretend to ignore that person. But when that special someone is not around, you might look around to find them. At that moment, you are in love.  Although there is someone else who always makes you laugh, your eyes and attention might go only to that special someone. Then, you are in love.  Although that special someone was supposed to have called you long back, to let you know of their safe arrival, your phone is quiet. You are desperately waiting for the call! At that moment, you are in love.  If you are much more excited for one short e- mail from that special someone than other many long e-mails, you are in love.  When you find yourself as one who cannot erase all the messages in your answering machine because of one message from that special someone, you are in love.  When you get a couple of free movie tickets, you would not hesitate to think of that special someone. Then, you are in love.  You keep telling yourself, "that special someone is just a friend", but you realize that you can not avoid that person's special attraction. At that moment, you are in love.  While you are reading this page, if someone appears in your mind, then u are in love with that person.
