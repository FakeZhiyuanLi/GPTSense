           i just added two new cds in my collection. ive been really obessed about my collection of cds lately. i just bought ashlee simpson and hoobastank this week.. they both rock! =) im like a music freak here. i listen to my cd player every single day. now if only i could learn how to play my guitar. mybe i could also write my own songs! haha! that would be really awesome. but i dont think i want to be a   songwriter or a musician of some sort. actually i just thought about it right this minute. anyway, im gonna have to babysit tomorrow.. again. i   know it sucks. you know, when i was little i used to love kids. like.. im like totally obsessed with them. i even used to pretend that my baby dolls (stuffed animals even) were my own kids! --ya.. really creepy--&nbsp;>=)&nbsp;but now, i dont like them at all. it just came to me that living near one (or some) really drives me crazy! its not like   i didnt live near some of em in the phil. but its like totally different here. kids here are so   annoying and spoiled   and bossy. theyre basically little brats. hey im not talkin bout newborn babies - 3 yr olds. theyre really cute. i love them. im talkin bout 4 - 6 yr olds. girls to be specific. anyhow, i still have to babysit tomorrow (good thing theyre both little boys).. and thats that. oh yea.. take my advice. if youre about to buy a cd and u love punkrock music.. u gotta buy ashlee or all american rejects. trust me.

       yeayy!! last night was sooooo much fun. my friend picked me up from my house around 6 to go to our new highschool's open house. i got my schedule and guess what? i have 2 periods with my friend! yeay!! ahahah! i also saw some of me long lost friends there. well theyre not really my loonnnggggg lost friends but its been 2 months since ive last seen them and thats actually a long time. i was kinda disappointed when i found out that theres gonna be alot of kids from my junior high. it sux. gosh those preppy girls get on my nerves!!!!!!! not all of em though. i mean, i know some of em and theyre actually friendly. but most of em act like theyre the queen of the universe!!!!!! arrghh!! fuck those little mini skirts and abercrombie shirts!!!!!! fuck them. i dont like them at all. anyway, i saw jeremy from jr high, tiffany, dylan, blah blah blah.. there was alot of em. i didnt get to see all the hot senior guys though (sad...) coz it was THE open house and not everyone really attend that kind of event. i mean.. i didnt want to. i just did coz my friend asked me to acompany her while she meets all her teachers. omg i think i lost 15 pounds from running around coz my friend was sooo much in a hurry. it was like the real thing for her.. she didnt wanna be late to any of the classes. shes a big worry-wart. it was just so hilarious... her mom was even laughing at her. ahahhahahhahahah!!!!! anyway, i cant wait till school starts. in all honesty.. im kinda excited. but im still bummed that summers over. oh well.

          wonderin how my day went today? first off, i woke up around 7:30 hearing the door slam when my mom went to work. i was plannin to wake up around 8:30 so i could take a shower and eat breakfast before babysittin.. unlike the last 5 days. err.. yupyup.. im tired of babysittin but i have to coz its summer and people are expecting me to not just sit around the house. by the way.. i was up all night tryin to draw somethin like a do almost every night. well... last night i was trying to finish my drawing of avril lavigne. it turned out great!! it doesnt look   exactly   like her but when u look at it, you kinda will know that its her. its prolly the best drawing ive done since i started improving my skills in art. hahahhaa! anyway, around 2.. my friend started begging me to ditch babysittin for tomorrow so we could go somewhere. i was like 'id do anythin to get out of it'... but the only problem is.. that my parents would prolly not let me just change plans in the last minute. im still trying to think of a good excuse so they could tell my stepsister that i cant babysit tomorrow. as for now.. my only excuse is to pretend that   i feel sick   not that im sick .  hmmm... help me out here!!! actually.. im not playin.. i   do   need your help. i really really wanna go with my friend. its like a once in a lifetime chance for me to go somewhere really far from home without my parents. hehe.. =D *sigh* its already 7:30pm and an hour away till my mom gets home. ill prolly ask her by then. well, i have to. arrghh!!! ill just sing for you guys while i wait.....    "dont make me cry coz this love dont feel so right. you cant push a river, you cant make me fall.. but you can make me unreachable."      var chatterbox = 'no';     if (!chatterbox  chatterbox != 'ok') { document.write('This  urlLink flooble chatterbox  is'); document.write(' temporarily unavailable. It will be back up shortly.'); }
