      today started really late for me because i slept in until about two. i think i am becoming and insomniac because lately i have been up until 5 am or later all week. it is making me really slow and it's a lot tougher to run when you feel like your dead. right now is the first day of august which is kick ass because that means that it's only 25 days until i can drive(finally). i also have to get up in 6 hours to go to my church and give a presentation about what we did and stuff. for anyone who is wondering it is 1 in the morning. that all for now, tune in tomorrow...   lyrics  i'm just gonna pick something-ipicked this song becasue yesterday i saw michael moore on real time on hbo and it was one of the funniest things ever, because he destroyed the republican guy.  NOFX  "American Errorist (I Hate Hate Haters)"  It’s ok,  allow yourself a little hate Hatred is not so bad when directed at injustice You can turn the other cheek, just don’t turn the other way Enemy of the planet we finally have a common aim a reason to forget about our differences and stand as a united front It’s up to us, we must expose, Humiliate American errorists We’ll start with one The war has just begun The war has just begun!

      i am feeling kinda iffy on this blog thing, becuase my sister told me today that she read this thing which really sucks and she showed it to my mom, which sucks more. i was kinda pissed off because now they are asking me lots of annoying questions. but on the bright side i am watering some one from my church's flowers and i will get some money for it, so that will be nice. By the way, i'm looking for a bass player and a drummer and possibly keyboards for some kind of band. and if anyone has any cool songs to play on guitar you should leave a comment saying what it is. o ya, and chris if you read this you should have a party at your house cuz that would be cool. until tomorrow...  the lyrics this time are by brand new, the song is called "the quiet things that no one ever knows" it is a great song, you should check it out  "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows"  We saw the western coast I saw the hospital Nursed the shoreline like a wound Reports of lover's tryst Were neither clear nor descript We kept it safe and slow The quiet things that no one ever knows  [Chorus: x2] So keep the blood in your head And keep your feet on the ground If today's the day it gets tired Today's the day we drop out Gave up my body and bed All for an empty hotel Wasting words on lower cases and capitals  I contemplate the day we wed Your friends are boring me to death Your veil is ruined in the rain By then it's you I can do without There's nothing new to talk about And though our kids are blessed Their parents let them shoulder all the blame  [Chorus: x2] So keep the blood in your head And keep your feet on the ground If today's the day it gets tired Today's the day we drop out Gave up my body and bed All for an empty hotel Wasting words on lower cases and capitals  [Bridge: x2] I lie for only you And I lie well...Hallelu...  [Chorus: x2 (words from bridge in the background)] So keep the blood in your head And keep your feet on the ground Today's the day it gets tired Today's the day we drop out Gave up my body and bed All for an empty hotel Wasting words on lower cases and capitals   "Hey Ron!, I'm riding a furry tractor" -anchorman

      "Comfortably Numb" Pink Floyd From the album "The Wall"  Hello,  Is there anybody in there  Just nod if you can hear me  Is there anyone at home Come on now  I hear you're feeling down  I can ease your pain  And get you on your feet again  Relax  I'll need some information first  Just the basic facts  Can you show me where it hurts  There is no pain, you are receding  A distant ship smoke on the horizon  You are coming through in waves Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying  When I was a child I had a fever  My hands felt just like two balloons Now I've got that feeling once again I can't explain, you would not understand  This is not how I am  I have become comfortably numb   O.K. Just a little pin prick There'll be no more aaaaaaaah! But you may feel a little sick Can you stand up? I do believe it's working, good That'll keep you going through the show  Come on it's time to go.   There is no pain you are receding  A distant ship smoke on the horizon  You are only coming through in waves Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse  Out of the corner of my eye  I turned to look but it was gone  I cannot put my finger on it now  The child is grown  The dream is gone  And I have become  Comfortably numb.

      i felt like crap the past couple of days and i'm not sure why but nothing too exciting has been going on. i have mostly been sitting and trying to beat zelda again. this can be fun, but it gets less fun after 6 hours. i'm sure someone out there knows what i'm talking about. but anyway, school is getting closer which really sucks because i didn't get to do anyhting cool this summer becasue i still don't have my license, which keeps me stuck at my house doing nothing all the time. i probabl sound bitchy but that kind of how i feel. until the next episode...

      Nirvana cover of a david bowie song  -from the album Unplugged in New York  "The Man Who Sold The World"   We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when  Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend  Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes  I thought you died alone, a long long time ago   Oh no, not me I never lost control  You're face to face  With The Man Who Sold The World   I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home  I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed   I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here  We must have died alone, a long long time ago   Who knows? not me  We never lost control  You're face to face  With the Man who Sold the World

       i am trying to remeber what happened the last couple of days so i'll need a second...okay here we go... sundayi went to the fair and went to see styx and kansas, styx put on a really good show but kansas proved my theory about the first band. the first band,no matter how good, can never get the audience going, and this was the case, kansas came on and played and everyone just watched, and when styx came on it was crazy. everybody was amped up and they were outsinging the band, it was cool. now for monday... i had to get up around nine which sucked becausei didn't get to sleep until like 2. i didn't realize that i had to go all over springfield for like 6 hours, but i had to go to the dentist. before i got to go get a bunch of new clothes,so that was alright. i got a bunch of classic rock shirts and a story of the year one. and it was all on sale. wOOt! but i went to the dentist and they told me i have to get a filling ripped out becuase i have a cracked tooth underneath the filling, which fucking sucks. and today i can finally almost see normal again and i avoided going to the doctor, which is always a plus. cross country practice started today and it wasn't too bad. i had command of my own little group, and it was mike and cody and we ran really slow and talked about guitars which was sweet. but on the other hand someone reminded me of homecoming today and once again i start the debate within myself on whether i should go. but who cares... i don't!  i think next time i update it will be a retrospect on the summer so it'll be fun.  lyrics a song called summer sum 41 summer  It's far beyond your reach, it holds a place in time, Somewhere ahead is the back of the line. I can't relate to your mistakes, awkwardly speaking with nothing to say.  Caught up in your life, excuses are so lame, You may be different but I'm still the same. The reasons that you thought, the intention that you caught, You say things are simple, we both know they're not. You can't let it go,  Whoa.  You can't but I know.  Whoa,  Whoa you don't even know.  [Chorus]  It's not in what you do, more in what you say A million questions asked, the remnants of the past. You've always been denied, but always by your side I've always tried to, to understand you, the worlds not learning from you.  Whoa.  Whoa.  [Chorus]

      today started all right but ended up the worst  day ever, my eyes gotreally red and i think i have pink-eye or something, and i think i knocked a filling out of my teeth because i can't drink anyhting now or i get exruciating pain and  i can't go to the dentist until monday. today sucked ass.  lyrics rare nirvana song kinda describes how i feel  I Hate Myself And Want to Die  Runny nose and runny yolk Even if you have a cold still You can cough on me again I still havent had my fulfill  In the someday what's that sound? Broken heart and broken bones Think of how a castrated horse feels  (Alt: Think about some capsules of horse pills) One more quirky cliche'd phrase You're the one I wanna refillIn the someday what's that sound?  - Spoken interlude in middle -  Most people don't realize That two large pieces of coral, Painted brown, and attached to his skull With common wood screws can make a child look like a deer

      this is gonna be a long one...  well haven't updated in awhile and i will now explain why, the thursday before the garage sales i had to basically haul a  third of my house down to my vans and then haul into someone's yard and that took all day. i was so sore after that i decided just to go to bed instead of update this. then, the next day was the first day of the actual sale and i had to get my ass up at like 7:30  and arrange stuff and keep a four year old entertained all day. it's a lot harder than you think. i spent most of my day on a really nice trampoline that shot me like 8 or 10 feet up which was really awesome but hurt me the next day. we had a good day at the garage sale, we made about 200 bucks. then on saturday i got up and i was so sore i could barely move and it was about 8 when i got up. that day was pretty boring more jumping on trampoline, and my achilles was breaking off my foot by now, i got to bring my guitar though so that kept me kind of entertained. we ended making about 300 some dollars altogether. i actually made about 30 bucks so i was pretty happy. now on to sunday, i had to get up really early again for a mission trip speech thing at both of the church services and i got some DQ in beetween and went straight home and went to sleep for about the rest of the day, but at seven i had to go run and i was dead. now for monday, i can't really remember what happened that day( i think me and chris have problems.) i'm not sure what day monday was. hold on, i gotta check. it was the ninth. i remember my mom made me clean the house all day becuase my uncle and cousin were coming the next day and the place was still a wreck from the garage sale stuff. well that's all i did that day, but i did get money for it so it's all good. the next day the tenth i had to do more cleaning stuff, but not as much because i didn't wake up until noon. when my cousin and uncle came at 5 we hung out and talked and had vic's pizza(the best on the earth).after that it was jam session time. my uncle got his pedal box and it had like tons of settings and you could make all kinds of crazy sounds with it, it was freaking great, than he gave me a cardboard box and it had an overdrive pedal, chorus(tone thickener) pedal, and a distortion pedal. Fuckin' Right!!! that was kick-ass. i assumed it was my birthday present and thanked him about a million times. i have even more stuff to annoy my family with. ya! now the next day was ummm... wednesday...my family hung around until about ten and i had to go get my physical before they left, which are really annoying. i'm not excactly sure what else i did on wednesday so i'll skip it. thursday, my mom's friend from high school was coming and so were my grandparents and more cousin's but my mom's friend were the only ones that ended up coming. o yeah and before this i got to drive through the state fair to get tickets for the styx/kansas concert, that place is fucking annoying to drive through and it makes me nervous because there about a million state cops and they had the dogs and everything. later we went back to the fair to watch the parade and the parade run. ben did pretty good in it, but who cares. the parade was a load of bullshit, though. i wanted to check stuff out there, but it was impossible and i got really pissed off so i just got my dad and left. that brings me to today, i got 50 dollars for watering and mowing for someonewhile they were gone. which was sweet. so i actually have some money now. today i got up and ran which turned out to be alright. i got to see mike's guitar and his 1200 watt sub, which is insane, and he built it himself. then i decided to update this and here i am.

      i decided not to write one yesterday becuase nothing intersting happened, well here it goes...ont tuesday i sat around and did nothing but i did manage to finally beat wind waker again. that's all for yesterday, today i woke up to my mom and brother yelling at me and telling me to get stuff out of my room for a garage sale, this kind of sucked because everything i didn't want i threw away about a month ago, so i am probably not going to get any money from, which sucks becuase i could really use some money, anyway... i spent the rest of the day hauling crap down from the attic which is about 150 degrees. on the bright side trey came over and we jammed he did some vocals and we made up kind of a harmonica style song except with power chords and distortion, it sound pretty good.  when he was about to leave the crappiest thing happened, the mic broke, even after i built a mic stand and everything, that kind of pissed me off. and after that i had to go run, which turned out to be better than i expected, and after that i got to take my 10 year old plymouth voyager for a spin so that was a lot of fun, that thing can go like hell, oh yeah and i missed the story of the year concert on MTV and i was looking forward to that, but oh well, until next time...  lyrics  "God Save The USA" Pennywise  God you must be kidding me, thought this was supposed to be The home of the brave and the free for you and me But now there's something wrong - shit's been going on too long. It's never gonna change, there's no way i say. What's the CIA and the NRA? They're all the same - just the names are changed. Fuck - there's no excuse - any way you lose. It's all a joke in the god old USA. All we need is more factories pumping filth into the sky. Corporate greed and perverted priests, it's the story of our lives. And apathy's the national disease and there is no end in sight. God save the USA - blame the president and say your prayers tonight. The irony of liberty is no one here is truly free When elections are stolen bij the G.O.P. So watch the nightly news - find out how you are getting screwed. What you gonna do? - there's no use i say Fuck the industry - the aristocracy Fuck they're all the same - just the names are changed. Fuck ther's no excuse, any way you lose. It's all a joke in the good old USA.Government hypocricy  -American Idolatry - Corporate philosophy. Nightly news of tragedies - Whre no one cares what's right or wrong Our heroes now are all long gone - The freedoms that we all abuse The obituaries front page news

      today was an average kind of day, didn't do to much exciting stuff, however i did finally get cable tv in my room, which is pretty cool. i'm sure everyone already has it. and when i got back i sat down to play guitar trey showed up out of nowhere, and we hung out for a little bit and it was a pretty good time. i found out that him  and michael were the ones that ding-dong ditched my house at 1 in the morning, but i didn't care because i was still awake. i think i might be a slight insomniac becuase i can't sleep hardly at all anymore. that why i am still awake right now. i just finished watching cabin fever on cinemax and it was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. it was an ok plot, but it was way too obvious what was going to happen and in the end everybody died and so did the cool guy who didn't get it becuase the cops shot him. well whatever, if you were thinking about watching that movie you should skip it. that's all for now, tune in next time...    lyrics  "I Don't Know" Lostprophets( it actually is one word) from Start Something  Today they asked me, "what do you always seem to find?" But though I could not answer I'd have lost my way And I could tell that this ain't right The morning sunrise seemed to ask me why I tried To find the strength in people who had never thought about a different way of life It just doesn't seem that easy  I don't know where to go I don't know what to be I don't know how to change from being me I don't know what to say Maybe another day I'll stop getting lost and find my way, home All I know is gone...  But the storms of weather, you know they don't seem to be as bad  If you think there's hope from here and there's a life you should now have I don't have answers and no questions spring to mind So here I've ended up now, there's no more signs and the roads are blocked Aw, man...  It just doesn't seem that easy I don't know where to go I don't know what to be I don't know how to change from being me I don't know what to say Maybe another day I'll stop getting lost and find my way, home All I know is gone...   (I see no reason to move on)  I don't know where to go I don't know what to be I don't know how to change from being me  I don't know what to say Maybe another day  I'll stop getting lost and find my way, home All I know is gone...
