      We're starting to move today, and we're probably going to be finished by Friday or something. Maybe Thursday but you never know. On Saturday I have to go to the District Meet for track. Fun.. I did horrible at our last meet. It was just really bad. I didn't to do anything and it pissed me off because my dad said that he was going to be there, but he couldn't show up in time because he had a lot of "errands" to do. Yeah right, even if he did he could have done them today or after my fucking meet or something. But anyways, we have a choir tour tomorrow as in Elementary schools and stuff. Should be fun, anyways.. I got to go to Confirmation, I love you Troy, night night.

      I'm eating a crunch bar.. yummy crunch bars are good! Anyways I've been ungrounded for a few days. Ever sense Friday. Branson was so freaking awesome. We got a big trophey and we got the highest rating out of all the middle schools in the compitition. Although I don't know how many schools there are. Hell, there could have been 2 schools. Then we went to Silver Dollar City. I got my mom a Mother's Day gift there. Then my stupid ass brother left it on the floor so my stupid ass dog got to it and chewed it all up. Damn biatch. Oh well.. it's not in pieces. One of the top thingys is cracked in half.. and the biggest one has teeth marks, but that be it. Troy has a Friday night today. :'( I can't talk to him for awhile. Ashlee's in Branson and she's going to be there until Saturday or so. We have a concert on the 18th. Then the last day of school is the 28th... hell yeah! I should go, bye bye.

      Yeah actually the post yesterday I didn't finish. So I'm in Team Studies right now doing another one of these thingys. Yesterday was our Metro North performance thing. It was fun. I think we messed up on the last number though. Other than that it was pretty good. Tomorrow we go to Branson though, then to Silver Dollar City. We're going to be judged on the performance, but we're not in the competition, although I think we should be.  performance is around 10:30 or so, and whenever that's over, we go straight to Silver Dollar City until whenever time and we get back home around 11:00 or 12:00 PM. So it should be fun. Yeah I'm going to go now. Bye bye.

      Today's pretty boring. Troy's still at his Aunts house and he's not going to be back until late. I don't think we've gone more than 24 hours without talking for a long time. We've gone 3 days before, but it was a long time ago. I played some games and got online and watched a movie but it's all pretty boring. Ummmmm... I really have nothing else to say.. bye bye.

      The summer days are pretty boring when you're not with anyone. Basically all I can do is sit on my ass on play video games or something. Nothing active. Oh well. But the days that Troy come over or something is always really fun. He's over at a friend's house now. Ummmm.. I really don't have much to say so I'll just go now, bye bye. I LOVE TROY A LOT!

      Today, my mom, Joe, and I went to the library. I got 2 different books on Romeo and Juliet, I think 2 of Shakespear's Dictionaries, an Edgar Allen Poe book with all of his published writings, and a huge poem book with famous poems in them. I really don't know what came over me but I just really wanted to read some of those books. The librarian there really helped too. So I guess I'll be reading most of the day unless Troy can come over. Anywho I'm gonna go. Later.

      I really like The Beatles. I still think they're the best. Anyways, summer's going pretty good. The only bad thing is, Tuesday-Friday, I have to watch my brother from sometime early morning until 3:00 PM. But it's not all that bad. I get 50 dollars sometime at the end of the week too. I'm gonna buy a swimsuit and probably some smelly good stuff from Bath and Body Works. I love that place. So many testers and you come out smelling like a fucking whore. Which is always fun.  Gordmans is an awesome store. I swear they have everything there. And they're really cheap, compared to other stores.   My brother is addicted to the weather and the weather freaking channel. It's sometimes really funny but also really annoying. Everytime there's just a little bit of lightning and thunder, he's like, "We should check the Weather Channel." But sense I'm watching TV at that time, I say no, and so he gets online and goes to weather.com or whatever. Like right now, he's checking the weather and telling me what's going to happen later on today in the "weather world".  Teen Titans is a kick ass show. I love you Troy!

      I got back yesterday.  When we got to Jefferson City (July 20th, 2004): We basically got into our rooms, which we had a slight missunderstanding, but it all worked out. So we got unpacked and our air mattresses blown up, and all of that stuff. I didn't get to sleep until past 1:00AM, and we had to wake up at 6:00AM.  First work day (July 21st, 2004): We woke up at 6:00, and made our lunches and ate and stuff around 6:30. We get our assingments and we leave for Folton, Missouri, which is about a half an hour away from where we were, and the people there told us that there were fences around dumpsters that needed to be painted. So we did a whole lot of them. It was hot outside, very hot. And the heat index was well over a hundred. We finished there around 400ish or 330ish, I can't remember. We went back to the church we were staying at, which was First United Methodist.  I don't want to explain the rest right now, so I'll tell later.

      It was scary last night. I heard a loud thunder and I woke up. Then my brother was running around, I just thought he got scared of the thunderstorm so he was gonna wake up my mom. So I tried to get back to sleep, and I put one of my pillows over my ear so the thunder wouldn't be as loud. And everytime I did, I would hear a high-pitched squeal type thing. So I layed there for a few minutes, and I heard the TV on, so I went into the living room. My parents and my brother were staring at the TV and shit. And then I heard the sirens more clearly. It was scary outside. But all is good. Troy called, and when the phone rang I knew it was him! I love my baby! So we talked for about an hour or so. Then we got off the phone, I stayed up for probably another half an hour, and my dad left for work. Then I went back to sleep. I'm gonna go now, bye bye!

      We got rid of our dog a few days ago. She's with my Uncle. At least now she has a backyard to play in and stuff. I haven't seen her this happy in a long time. But it's all good because I'm pretty sure that we will get her back when we get our house, sometime next year. I go to the doctor's on Monday.. gonna be fun. I can't wait until my birthday for some reason. Troy's birthday is on the 3rd of August, mine is on the 6th, and Austin's is on the 8th. We all have to decide what we're gonna do. I have a birthday list somehwere but I don't know where it's at. So I'll make one on here. TV Computer Cell phone Queen size bed Feather down comforter with all the stuff matching with it Feather down pillows A comfortable mattress Money Cordless phone  I don't know why I put this on here, I'm just bored.

      My Forth of July went pretty well.. for the most part. On the 3rd, my family went to my uncle's girlfriend's house. Her name is Mary. I had so much fun. They had horses and 4 wheelers and big fireworks and yeah I just had fun. On the 4th, my family went to my mom's friend's house. It was pretty boring for the most part because her daughter ditched me to go with her friends. Yeah pretty bitchy. But oh well. The firework show was the only reason that made it kind of fun. I'm gonna go. Bye bye.
