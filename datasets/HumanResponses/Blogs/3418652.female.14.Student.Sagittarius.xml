      Brittney loved basketball,  Friends and parties too,  And when it came to painting,  That's all she wanted to do.  She painted everything she saw,  Birds, flowers, and the sky,  Some days she sat at her window,  And painted everything that passed her by.  But lately she'd been feeling woozy,  Her muscles ached a lot,  And her parents got kind of worried,  So they took her to the doc.   The doctor took a couple of tests,  To see if everything was okay,  Then the nurse came out with a look of sadness, And this is what she had to say;    "I'm sorry, but you've got leukemia,"  You've got about 3 months more."  Then Brittney got up and ran out of the room,  And slammed the office door.  She ran down the street screaming,  And cried her eyes out dry,  And stayed up all night,  Wondering what it's like to die.  Her parents held her tightly,  And said, "We love you,"  "We'll make your last few months the greatest,"  "We'll do anything for you."  So Brittney and her parents moved to Florida, to  live by the sea,  Because Brittney loved the ocean,  And when she died, that's where she wanted to  be.   She spent her days painting,  And horseback riding in by the bay,  But one day she met this guy,  And his name was Jay.   They collected seashells together,  And talked about all kinds of things,  And then one day while walking,  He handed her a ring.   It said, "I love you,"  Which brought tears to Brittney's eyes,  And when he put it on her finger,  She began to cry.  He asked her what was wrong,  and she then replied, "I've got leukemia, and  about a month more."  He said," No matter what, I love you  And no matter what, you are the one I adore."   So they spent everyday together,  And swam in the Atlantic all day,  But Brittney was getting weaker,  And it was hard for her stay awake.   So one day Brittney painted her picture,  And gave it to Jay,  She said, "I want you to remember me,"  "Even when I leave this place."  But one day while they were walking,  And searching for seashells in the sand,  Brittney collapsed and started to lose her  breath,  And said to Jay, "Please hold my hand."   I love you more than anyone,"  You are my only true love,"  But now my time is up,"  And I'll watch over you from above,"   Then Brittney's body was lifeless,  As she lay in Jay's arms,  And he sat there all day,  And kept her safe from harm.   I hope this teaches you a lesson.  To tell someone you love them whenever you can.     Because maybe they'll be gone tomorrow. And you  won't be there to  hold their hand.   Because love is everything to everybody. Without  it, the world would be dead. So always tell  someone you love them. A  parent, boyfriend/girlfriend, or friend.

      Yoxyoxyox... really long time never update here liao. Hahahax.. Since li Ching wrote something about TMG in her blog, then i am going to write one too. Hahahax... TMG, was formed in the year Jan 2004, with 10 members.  -History- TMG... formed in the year 2004. With 10 members, but actually is 9, coz Sophia, was not really as crazy as us. But we still counted her as one of our members! hahahax. Initially, our name, TMG, stands for Ten Mad Girls. After all the 'conferencing', we decided to change it to The Mad Girls, in case TMG members found anymore 'gila gila' gals to join TMG.  -What do we TMG usually do- We will crowd around at each others' tables, laughing loudly like nobody's business. Hold hands together, which may be misunderstood as LESBAINS. In fact we are all NORMAL. We all like GUYS, not GALS. Recently, one of the TMG member, Eliza, go on steady, with CEDRIC.   Other than that, we will hold our hands together. Not simply hold hands. Remember? We got about 9 people. Normally, the famous TMG les is Eliza and En Ci (which is me), followed by Vanessa, Sheila and Ann. If we all hold our hands together, then we wld block the whole stair case, which may invite troubles. We will joke and talk nonsense, totally senseless things. We will organise outings... birthday parties etc.  -TMG Servant Association- This was actually TMG members. As our 'main branch', 3E2, was as dirty as a pig sty, and SOMEONE, whose name is ........ will sweep all hers' or may not be hers, rubbish, to Sheila's place. Thus, we invented this Association. We even came up with a pledge, both english and chinese.  -TMG Members- =Cynthia Tan =Eliza Tan--- BF.. Cedric -_- =Nellie Tan =Vanessa Loy aka Jay Chou =Jessy Yo  =Loretta Heng =Sheila Cai =Ann Lam =Sophia Tien =Zheng En Ci, which is me...  PEACE TO TMG!!! MUACKX.. I LOVE TMG MATES. MAY OUR 'TMG SPIRIT' LAST ETERNALLY...

      yOx..Till now i am still coughing.. going to die soon. Don't worry. Soon. I can't survive that long. Yesterday went for the SAF band concert. Conductor was Frank Ticheli. Quite nice.. the concert. But still.. i am not happy. Know y? coz i saw U NOE HU U R. with ahem and ahem. Broken Heart... Everything has come to the end. Everything is gone. ok.. don't talk bout this. This is not important. -_-|||  Got SOMEBODY... thought next time she can become bitch manager. Ordering me and my ho peng you around. Actually got TWO SOMEBODY. One is ... the other one is ***. Understand? NVM. Future bitch manager you know. Must treat her with respect. We are only the servants. What can we do? Wash toilet, mop floor, sweep floor, clean table. Then our dinner is at KOPITIAM. Oh. SOMEONE called it STAR BUCKS. That STAR BUCKS is KOPITIAM to him. Oic. Now then i know. Please lor, PEOPLE very $$$$ one. Loaded with $$$$$$$$$. KOPITIAM. What is that? ORHHHH... STAR BUCKS arh.  icic. Next time we go star bucks. (KOPITIAM). Then go kopitiam means STAR BUCKS. Must remember ok. Be the spy somemore. So next time me and my ho servant peng you will be more careful. In order not to let out any infor. To the two BITCH MANAGERS. See who become first. OK? Then got TWO PERSON fighting to be DOG MANAGERS la. I knew that. It's nothing. Dog Manager is a wonderful 'job'. Too bad i not interested.   Then arh... that ***. Tsk tsk. So pathetic arh. Like to look at me arh. It's nothing. Me and my ho servant peng you already got used to that. Since beginning of the year we already yi pao er hong. This is no big deal to us. Ok.. back to that *** know what she did?  ^^^, told the whole ---- that we could only wear black or dark blue rubber bands. He was simply insulting someone. But of course never mention names.  Meaning was simple. Meaning--why are you wearing LIGHT BLUE rubber band? Then that *** purposely say WHO ARH??? So who arh? It's nothing lah, it's gonna be ME. I think by saying 'who arh' to the ---- not enough la. Go put in newspaper article. Good idea. You know. =_=|||  I am wondering how am i going to survive in this world. Such world. Will i overcome or overthrow THEM? THEM refers to ... *** ^^^ and of course many more, which i will not say, coz i scared i will get choke or i will get sore throat.  My flute? Will i be the master? Or i will be the servant of it? Will i overcome my soft spoken-ness? Because many people finds me unfriendly. Not that i am unfriendly i am just too quiet. Only in ---- then i am quiet lah. Coz i've got nothing to laugh at or talk about. But in the eyes of TMG, i am a different person. That was the real me. Hyperactive. Not really the quiet type. In ----, people scold me i keep quiet. People insult me i also keep quiet. Man. This is not going to work. Lao hu bu fa hui ni dang wo shi bing mao? Really went overboard liao. Me and my ho peng you. Are just servants in their eyes. They have every right to insult us. It's nothing. But we only have the right to keep quiet.   I scared i might explode one day. I scared i might not be able to take it. But i tell myself, no matter how hard is this going to be, i must overcome it. This is part of life. If you let bitches obstruct your way to the next level of life, then it is not worth it at all. But my patience is really limited. I keep quiet simply because i am tolerating. I am giving that *** face. If i really want to quarral.. nobody can win me. But will i be able to do it? Will i quarral with ***? No! I won't want to waste my precious saliva because of ***. I've got better things to do. And she got so many buddies. Out numbered me. So if i quarral with all of them.. Man... send me to my coffin please. Pleeeaasseee..... rao le wo ba. I really tired of this kind of life. Everyday need to be other peoples' vent-anger-machine. Or servant.  Last sentence for this entry.  FUCK OFF ****, go and be your BITCH MANAGER as long as you like. I won't mind a bit.

Recess time have changed. So now, the only chance i can see him was in the morning, when he walked to flag rising ceremony. But the chances are slim. Sometimes don't even get to see him leh. Then after school, if got fate perhaps can get to see him bah. But again, chances are slim.  Why why why. Why must they change sec 3Es recess time. Why can't they change the 3Ns and 3Ts instead. Like that i can get to see him more. Jess can see her lao shu wah. Aiyo.. that Xiao tian tian arh. That Aineeeeee haizz... Change the time table until like that. Don't know what the hell they are doing! Now got to have recess with sec 1 and sec 2. Damn suck man! They are so childish! oops. I miss him like hell!! Tsk. Anyway, i love Jung Yoon Ho~! hahahax.

Mickey's voice was so unique. My dear is the bass part. Hahahax. Then Max. His part. Okok lor. His part was the most easy to sing. I can sing his part without any error. hahahhax. Then i love Xiah's voice. Don't know why lex. Many of my friends think that Max is the most handsome and cute one. !!! Nono. He only know how to act cute! He 16 year old only lor. Hai xiao. lolx.
