      Yes it has. The rather unfortunate moment in any relationship, where despite one's best efforts, one is yelled at in a dispute over money.  It was not the greatest moment of my life, I wasn't able to do anything about it, just leave for a bit.  I was told that I needed to get a job, but wasn't given the blame for the catalyst, the bouncing of a check.  That was given to dear old mother, the unfortunate scapegoat.  Although she has been hostile to me in the past, I now feel rather sorry for her in the course of this ongoing drama as she really is blamed for more than she has done.    I thought briefly of bailing out.  This is my most common reaction, very animal in nature, the fight or flight sense we all have.  I love to choose flight.  That being impossible here, I returned shortly after going for my "walk to think things out".  I did present the idea of moving home for a while to earn money in a place where that is more possible than here, however, I don't think that this is a great idea either.    So now I am faced with a great challenge, getting a job within the week.  How? My calls for help have gone unheeded in this before and I don't think that even after this they will be enough to overcome the sloth that my other half dwells in.  My only hope is to try for the most bottom of the barrel job and then work my way up through it because let's face it, I am probably smarter and better educated than most of the people I'll be working with.  Sad but true.  I also have a much more smug and superior attitude than those people.  This will limit my ability to speak with them althought that may be a blessing in disguise.   I am increasingly convinced that life is an awful, about which only the truly lucky are ever shown the punchline.

      I walked in the rain to the bus station shortly after four o'clock this afternoon to get some beers and some picture frames.  I found a great deal on some frames and bought four for my lovely new wall installation called "black girls are better at it and have more fun" which is basically two pictures each of aretha franklin and maya deren, reproduced four times on a piece of paper and framed.  That is to say that each single picture appears on the paper four times.  It looks lovely on the wall in the living room that had this awful crack in it when we moved in.  I repaired it, but there wasn't much I could do to cover up my fix as well as the last person's bad fix it job.  It is at least something other than the god damn television to look at in the living room.  My roomate will not understand it, but she can eat it.   I am tired, I've had three beers and need something to do.  I'm listening to some good music right now, a bit loudly, which is unusual for me, but I do enjoy it.  I'm arguing whether or not to go to the corner store to buy some pop with which to mix the whiskey I have waiting for me in the freezer.  I'm going to be out of whiskey soon and I'm wondering whether I should buy more or not.  Yes i enjoy drinking it, but I need to seriously cut back on expenses until that job is landed, yet I think that everyday life is far too boring not to drink myself stupid everynight whilst I watch inane shit on television.  Again, a job will remove the whiskey bottle from my lips or at least postpone it from reaching my lips until days off.   I have a lot to do tomorrow, and people to get ahold of or figure out how to reach.  Hard times, yes, no fired.  I'm quitting this now

      Bored.  I bore myself to be reflexive about it.  Need entertainment that does not involve me staring at a screen for several hours at a time.    I exercised today! Pleased to get back to it after a few too many days off.  Probably good for the muscles though, for rebuilding, etc.    Things to do  1.  Call parents, explain credit issues with student loan consolidation.  2.  Go to temp agencies 3.  Go get actual, honest to goodness applications from places 4.  clean the bathroom 5.  get really drunk and fall asleep watching dallas on the Soap channel at 5pm 6.  touch up the paint in the hallway 7.  buy liquor at osco 8.  eat the brocolli before it goes bad 9.  have derrick drive me places tomorrow instead of taking the god damn bus. 10. stop eating crap food 11. do something fun and creative that doesn't cost much money 12. buy some 8.5 x 11 picture frames for art project. 13. don't die alone

      Oy.  What a day.  I had this appointment with the bloodsucking employment service today.  I did not make it though, no I, being blessed with a public transportation system that can really only effectively take me to the mall and wal-mart, couldn't find the damn place.  The road it was on is a road with which I am familiar, but still, no dice.  I was rather despondent after missing my appointment, but I thought about aspects of cognitive behavioral therapy and came home, called the place and got a new appointment.  Then I called several more temp agencies and got the information I needed to register with them.  So I adapted and overcame, which I think is rather a large breakthrough for me.  So hooray.    Anyway it is fucking hot.  I am speding much of my time in the one air conditioned room, however, that may change as the major entertainment equipment lives in the next room over.   I am trying to get a new digital cable box with optical outs, hopefully comcast likes me enough to hook me up.    I am so sick of Ronald Reagan.  Twenty four hour a day coverage of this fluffy story.  "This just in, Reagan is still dead, more at eleven".  I don't think presidents are heroes, I think they're cowards, I think they're pinned in my the system, and I think they're really unable to live up to our expectations or what we perceive the job of president to be.  This reagan shit is much worse though because history is being rewritten on television.  The last american president to only be covered by three television channels for thirty minutes a night is being respun by four twenty four hour a day newschannels, AM radio talkshow hosts, and online hack writers as a touchy-feely grandpa character, who never hurt anyone.  Even his falling asleep during cabinet meetings was brought up positively. David Gergen said "he deserved it".  Its all crap.    I want to watch the simpsons.

      It is tuesday, a national holiday for me, designated by special decree when I went to bed at four this morning.  I didn't want to have to do anything today, so I didn't.  Well, almost nothing, I did domestic chores that have become my sanity-creators; laundry, dishes, tidying up, et cetera.  I got some movies at the library, did a creative project for the first time in a million years, and now it is nearing six and my prospects are looking grim for the rest of the evening.    Tomorrow is my temp company appointment.  I am not excited, I'm sick of forms, surveys, applications, writing my social security number and most of all I am sick of being cheerful for strangers.  I do it well though. I appear very quiet and unassuming outwardly, polite.  Inside I am cursing the whole goddamned state of affairs.   I miss my friends as well.  I am only a phone call away, but it isn't the same.  I have been a friendless wonder down here for nearly four weeks and it is getting to me.  I am beginning to crack.  Marital relations offer only so much, but you experience the boundaries of where you're allowed to go, allowed to say without causing trouble.  I want to cause trouble though.    My other problem is with the narcoleptic that occupies the sofa all day, snoring to inane daytime television.  Court shows, COPS reruns, MTV, it all makes me wretch.  I could go to my bedroom, but I don't like being cooped up in one room all day, remember I am still jobless.  Perhaps once I get that elusive job, I will be more than happy to stay in my room.  She's not all bad, she bought furniture for the back porch and she hasn't seemed to notice or does not care that I drank two of the four bottles of wine that she bought the other day.    All in all though, my life is without major problems.  My complaints are minor, there is not much that I need, no life threatening issues.  I should be happy.  Well.... maybe later.

      So I am going crazy, again.  For time 6,093, I am finding myself in the position of having to make that fight or flight decision, this time the stakes are a bit high.    I also feel like I have no creative outlet.  I don't think I've had an effective creative outlet for years and none in which I haven't taken myself much too seriously.  I'm not sure when I made the change from naive, cause of the week, pretentious college student to pretentious, world weary, pompous asshole.  Perhaps it was about the time I quit college, moved to an unfamiliar city and stopped doing everything.  That was a long process, but I think it is all coming together well.  So now I am unemployed, I am kept, but unemployed, this bothers me to no end. I try, but somehow, it never really gets too far.  I have some prospects, but nothing seems to be working out.  I can't get past this corporate culture that has permeated every human resources office in the country. "What are your goals", "Where do you see yourself in the (insert company name) corporate tree". Maybe this would not annoy me so much if I wasn't applying for jobs that pay in the area of $7.00 an hour.    But I'm not all complaints, I have grumbles, hang-ups, problems, too.    Oh well, many months to write on these subjects.  Grrr
