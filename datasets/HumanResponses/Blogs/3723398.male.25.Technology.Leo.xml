      well, i'm in my first day of my MIMI training class at AspenTech ( urlLink http://www.aspentech.com/ ) in lovely Houston, TX.  i'll be here all week.  Houston seems nice, from the little i've seen of it - just about as humid as they come - and that from someone that's lived all their life in Atlanta & Nashville.  training so far ... lessee ... interesting, but old-hat stuff so far for me.  it's been nice getting the fleshed out "official" explanation/presentation, and it's afforded me the opportunity to find out some particulars and details i wouldn't have otherwise known, but thus far, there have been no major revelations.  BUT, i suppose that would be a credit to how well Mike trained me.  ;)  if all goes according to plan, i'll be able to meet up with a highschool buddy of mine for dinner sometime this week - for now, i'll hope for some of my fellow trainees being hungry after class - and if not... off on my own, i guess.  ;)

      so here's thoughts on my new job (and old job), now that i've had a bit over 1 week at it, full-time.  it's right nice to be able to step back and up a level, try to see and understand the big picture, and figure out the best course of action for said big picture.  i recently came from a "fire-fighting" job - that being, giving it all you've got just to keep up - life limited to living in I and III of the Covey Quadrants(tm), never making it to that sublime state of Quadrant II.  i learned quite a bit, about the operations and details of the business.  knowledge which has - and shall probably continue - to serve me well, but it never afforded me the chance to change things, and make them better.  conversely, my new job affords me the freedom (almost to the extent of being loosely defined) to dig into a process, question it, consider all the angles and alternatives, and (if need be) push to change it.  it seems the primary challenge in accomplishing this change is how to push who, when, and how hard.  going off my past experiences, step one is to sell the changee on why they need to do it - telling them they need to do it probably won't go too far towards the end goal.  darned thing is, it's just so much easier (especially for us nerd-types) to "tell" rather than "sell" - hopefully i can remember that.  perhaps more to come on that at a later date.  other new things - gmail!  it's different, but so far, i like it - i feel like waving a big "I TOLD YOU SO" flag to my former boss, assuming the gmail philosophy catches on like (f)atkins.  he was big on us filing every e-mail into an appropriate folder, and keeping the "Inbox" down to a bare minimum of messages.  i kept saying that i could keep all my messages in my inbox, and find any given message faster (remember - firefighting) just by searching appropriate keywords.  i'm not making the official change to gmail yet, but once it's out of beta - and particularly if they allow for POP3/other access - i'll probably take the plunge and go with it as my primary e-mail.  on a different gmail vein, everyone keeps yammering on about how horrible it is that they're screening your e-mail - privacy concerns, etc.  hmmm... sound like any other e-mail service or tool that auto-filters for spam out there?  how do they think it filters without screening your mail?  nevermind Yahoo! mail, which has been around for ages now, has been sending gmail invitations send to @yahoo.com addresses straight to the "bulk mail" folder - maybe i'm a conspiracist, but somehow i doubt that's a coincidence.  bottom line - if you're not running your own e-mail server, you need to accept that *legally*, someone is going to potentially be reading/screening/etc your mail.  be that your home ISP, your employer - you name it.  if it's that confidential, run your own mailserver and/or encrypt it.  ;)

      ... it's hard to say how this will turn out (i really do just use the namesake of the blog in speech/etc ALL THE TIME).  i've never been much of a maintainer of anything - i'm usually doing pretty good to get the oil changed in my truck.  i attribute that to being a high-level thinker.  ;)  oh well.  guess we'll see.  so, i guess i should define the starting point, here... * recently changed jobs to a new department within the same company.  still very new at it, but quite enjoying it thus far. * gettin' hitched soon, to a fabulous gal - got a lot to do, but am looking forward to it!  .... and ... that's it!  first post!

      so, I'm a bit over the half-way mark with the MIMI training in Houston.  It's been good so far - still nothing earth-shatteringly new, but it's been good to get information "direct from the source".  However, that's hardly on subject with this post.  ;)  having not much else to do, i went down to the hotel bar tonight, and seeing on of my favorite beers on tap (and feeling splurge-like), ordered up a draught of Guinness.  so there i was, minding my own business, sipping my draught, when the older fellow to my right asks, "So - y'like your Guinness, eh?"  hell if it wasn't a native irishman sitting right next to me!  he, oddly enough, was working on a Budweiser (which i later learned, was due to the "when in Rome..." reasoning).  a lengthy discourse, covering a variety of topics, from beer to sports to politics to beer to travel to work to beer... ensued.  said discourse was later joined by the two Swedes from my MIMI class that happened in.  So There I Was (tm) - me, an Irishman and two Swedes - in the suburbs of Houston, Texas - discussing life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and various themes thereupon.  it reached truly sublime levels when Latin American bartender Sergio joined in.  did we all agree all the time?  of course not.  did i gain an understanding of how closely [european] football is followed?  Sure.  did i get the chance to explain baseball to two Swedes who knew next to nothing of it?  Sure.  did the Irishman and I debate social policy - with the utmost respect for the others' opinion?  Sure.  the above, to me, is the true joy in travelling - sure, seeing new and interesting sites and scenery is all well and good, but the real joy is the people you can meet along the way, if you take the time to talk to them and just find out a little about them.  i can only hope that i will soon approach that magical 3 weeks of vacation - which, as was discussed tonight, is quite sub-par in Europe (to the extent of actually being illegal, at least in Sweden) - such as to be able to travel more, and continue to meet yet more people from different places and see more things.  if there's one thing that i, as an admitted cheapskate, would continuously spend good money on, it's travel.  i can only hope that my future career - in both monetary terms and "vactation" terms - will afford me the opportunity to do so as often as possible.  daniel
