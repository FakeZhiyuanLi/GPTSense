      Well, today is the last day of the Neopets Happy Meal promotion at McDonalds, and I'm not sure I'll ever get a speckled negg.  sadness.  Will someone please get me a speckled negg or a starry paint brush?  I'll be your best friend... (at least for a week or so, kind of like back in elementary school when you used to say things like that)  Speaking of best friends, I think Kenny would have to be best friend of the week, 'cos thanks to him, I have Gmail!  yay!  So that's the good news.  and if someone gets me a speckled negg, I'll have even better news for next time.

      I finally finished my costume for Kagura from Fruits Basket.  I don't really sew, at least not well, and this was the first pattern I've ever successfully finished.  For the dress, I altered a shirt pattern, and yes, I made the Kyo backpack from scratch.  I used a stuffed-animal pattern, changed a few of the curves, and installed a zipper (my first zipper!), pouch, and straps.  I found out that I hate sewing square neck-lines, and that pleats are not the easiest thing to figure out past 1AM.  But I'm quite pleased with the results.

      Today I'm listening to a BBC show with Humphrey Lyttelton (wonderful host of I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue and a great jazz trumpter, or so I've heard) and he starts the show with a story about the earliest words he remembers saying:  I was 3 years old at the time, and I remember standing with my father at a bus stop.  I believe it was a bus stop leading to Slough, but I can't remember what happened there, or indeed, why on earth we were going to Slough.  But apparently, what happened, as my father told me, was that a sleepy domestic cat came out of a gateway, and walked toward us, blinking, sat down on the pavement and then yawned, showing its teeth.  And I flung my arms around my father's tree trunk of a leg and said, "Let's dead that cat before it eats us."

      The MLA has a site with a  urlLink map thingy  that shows census data for languages spoken in the US.  There's some county in Southern CA that is pink, pink, pink.  Is this Orange County?  Everything south of Bakersfield is LA to me.  Anyway, it's a slow site, but the colors are rather pretty.

      I was just listening to a BBC quiz show and they asked people to finish off "strap lines" to movies...  Is that British for tag lines?  Most of the examples seemed like they could be tag lines, but some really wouldn't have worked, at least for an American audience.  hmm.

      So, I was talking to this pirate friend of mine the other day, and I noticed that he had a steering wheel down his pants.  I said, "Dude, you've got a steering wheel down your pants," and he says, "Arr, I know!  It's drivin' me nuts!"  I know you've probably all heard that one before, but I like that joke, and it's stuck in my head right now.

      ok, so it seems like no-one wanted my horrible 10 cent karaoke CD.  hmph.    Well, I've decided to offer a bigger prize this week... a custom T-shirt, tailored to the winner's size and taste (or at least, my view of your fashion sense), sewn by yours truly.  To make this prize yours, riddle me this:  What is the common link between these 5 songs?  Stevie Wonder - Signed, Sealed Delivered, I'm Yours Pointer Sisters - Jump (For My Love) Nico - These Days Proclaimers - I'm On My Way Simple Minds - Don't You (Forget About Me)  First to post the right answer via comment wins.  Oh, and it should be a somewhat detailed answer.  (This will make more sense if you know what the answer is.)

       urlLink Kenny  has posted a link to the trailer for the upcoming Lemony Snicket movie, but I would recommend visiting  urlLink this page  first.  I am curious to find out if the soundtrack will include Stephin Merritt/the Gothic Archies who wrote one song for each of the audio books, including  urlLink a very helpful song about Count Olaf .

      I know not all of you believe in British humour, but I think some of you might like this...  My favorite BBC radio programme is I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue, and this week's show (which will be up on the BBC4 website until Monday sometime) has a great Swanee Kazoo bit.  Swanee Kazoo is a reoccuring game where 2 players are given a duet to play, one person on the Swanee (slide) whistle and one on kazoo.  The song is Singing In the Rain, and I think it's the best rendition of the song I've heard in ages.  It's near the end of the show (about 25 min. in).   urlLink I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue

      Romie and Stevie's recent "I'm Moving Out of This-here-apartment Parties" have made me wish, just a little, that I too were moving so that I could give away piles of unwanted junk to my deserving friends.  Then it struck me: Why not give away my unwanted junk (I mean, er, cool stuff) via blog?  So I've decided that each week, I'll have a contest involving some sort of question and some sort of prize, and it might go something like this: This week's prize is a CD that I got for 10 cents when Tower Records on Durant closed last month.  I thought it was a great deal at 10 cents, but after listening to it, I'm not so sure.  That's right, it's DKKaraoke Karaoke Party vol. 1!  Here's the track listing...  1. Bobby McFerrin - Don't Worry, Be Happy 2. Jimmy Buffet - Margaritaville 3. The Clash - Should I Stay or Should I Go 4. B-52's - Deadbeat Club 5. Jim Croce - Bad, Bad Leroy Brown 6. The Monkees - (I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone 7. KC & the Sunshine Band - That's the Way (I Like It) 8. Olivia Newton-John - Physical  To win this week's contest, tell me via the comments link which song you will karaoke for me after winning this quite frankly terrible CD, and why you should be chosen as the Star Performer.

      I just got the DVD of the BBC miniseries with Colin Firth, which has got to be the best Colin Firthness money can buy.  Also this week, I've been listening to an audio book version (the Naxos release) at work, and it's pretty good.  I know it may be typically girly of me to love Pride and Prejudice, but I do.  And the consequence, it seems, of watching a screen adaptation and listening to a reading of a book I've already read (more than once) in the course of a week, is remembering all the references to the book in You've Got Mail (another of my favorites).  I don't care what anyone else says about it--it's a great romantic comedy.  JOE: I didn't know you were a Jane Austen fan. Not that it's a surprise. I bet you read it every year. I bet you just love Mr. Darcy, and that your sentimental heart beats wildly at the thought that he and whatever her name is are really, honestly and truly going to end up together.

      I had another run-in with the BART fashion police this morning.  However, unlike the last girl who called me a b*tch and a poser (for wearing a brown pashmina which obscured my Clay Aiken concert t-shirt over a skirt I've had since I was 7 years old...  who am I supposed to be posing as?!) , and told me that I could "get my head kicked in for that sh*t," the woman this morning was nice.  She had a gentle Eastern European accent and said, "You are be-u-tiful, everything!" and gestured with her hand from her face to her stomach.  I am wearing, from head to toe, a black fleece Kangol snood, the Gryffindor scarf I was knitting all last month (in time for the new Harry Potter movie, which was absolutely fantastic), purple velveteen pants, and Steve Madden trainers.  I happened to be yawning as she said that and I walked past her, and must not have looked my most glamorous 'cos we both laughed, and then she said, "No! Sleepy-beautiful!"  So, I'm learning to take the bad with the good, but it really just *so* much nicer when people are nice.  Gentle reader, please do not make idle threats to people just because they look like they wouldn't fight back, because some day, they just might.

      I recorded my voice acting demo last Friday dropped it off for my agent Monday afternoon. Since then, I've been anxiously waiting to hear back from her. Well, it's been approved, which means I can make a bunch to send to I'm-Not-Sure-Who, but lots of people. I'm going to have get a website one of these days, but until then, if any of you out there want to hear it, I can e-mail it as an mp3. Especially if you want to hire me for commercial or character work. Let me know.

      I took Zack to  urlLink Luna Park  tonight for his birthday, and he finally got to try their  urlLink You're a Pepper Too . Some of you may remember the LA Luna Park fiasco (they hadn't received that week's Dublin Dr Pepper shipment, and the 5 of us made the trek specifically for that purpose), as we certainly did, so I called ahead to make sure the SF one was serving. I'm not Dr. Pepper fan, but the drink is nice. I definitely prefer the original Dublin Texas Dr Pepper (made with cane sugar rather than corn syrup to the one we usually get with the strong aftertaste), and with the Absolut Vanilla and organic vanilla syrup, it makes for a smooth cocktail.  Oh!  And the best part, which Cynth was wondering about... It really does come with that adorable giraffe swizzle stick!  I love it.  It's in my purse right now.    The food was decent too. Zack was really into the goat-cheese fondue. We split a main course (pork with mushroom-gruyere stuff) that wasn't quite as yummy as that or the artichoke appetizer, and a fairly tasty spinach salad. Overall, a stuffing, good experience, it's worth visiting at least once.

      I'm on a real Harry Potter kick again. It's been at least 4 years since I started reading the books, so I decided it was time to listen to the audio version of the Philosopher's Stone that I bought awhile back. Stephen Fry is absolutely the perfect man for the job. Jim Dale reads the US version of the books, and he's fine, but I really prefer Stephen Fry's delivery, which is more humorously deadpan during the narration portions and more character-ish in the dialogue bits.     Anyway, the first book had to be followed wth the second, and then the third. As I haven't been able to get the British editions of the other audio books (books on CD are wonderful if you have an office job--I highly recommend it), I'm having to read them myself, mostly on BART. I'm on Azkaban right now, which has always been my favorite of the 5 so far. I really did love the movie (thanks again, Cuaron), but there was a lot left out, and I'm glad to be reminded of all the details.     Already, I'm dreading getting to the end of the fifth book with nothing else Potterish to read. So I was very happy this morning to discover a text-only version of J.K. Rowling's official site! I found the flashy version hard to navigate and never noticed the very cool  urlLink Extra Stuff .  Not wallpapers or icons, mind you, but actual information about characters and scenes that were left out, etc.  Joy.

      I just noticed on  urlLink MuggleNet  that Miranda Richardson (who played a delightful Queen Elizabeth in the Blackadder series) has been cast as Rita Skeeter in the fourth Harry Potter movie.  Now, I really hated the character in the book, but I'm hoping it'll be more fun on screen.  Kind of what Kenneth Branagh did for Gilderoy Lockhart and Emma Thompson for Professor Trelawny.

      The  urlLink Magnetic&nbsp;Fields  show last night was fantastic.&nbsp; The Palace of Fine Arts is a smallish venue with nice cushy seats and lovely acoustics.&nbsp; The Aussie opener, Darren Hanlon, was surprisingly good and played a set complete with a song about squash (the sport, not the food).   Many thanks to Dave for getting us row G center seats.&nbsp; (Very unfortunately, SM couldn't be there due to a last minute business trip to Singapore.)&nbsp; It took awhile to convince the girl at the will call booth that we were really David Hornung's friends and that she should give us the 4 tickets even though we didn't have his ID.&nbsp; She finally handed them to me saying that if a David Hornung showed up later, she'd come to row G, seats 46-52 and kick us all out, and that for future reference, we better have a copy of his driver's license, if this sort of situation were to again arise.   But yes, the concert was great.&nbsp; Stephen Merritt is as charming on stage as he is on disc, Claudia Gonson provides nice backings (I'm not crazy about her singing lead, but she does blend well with him) and keyboards, Asian Guitarist Dude is very good on guitar, and the Cellist Guy had a gorgeous tone.&nbsp; He reminded me that I really like the cello as an instrument.&nbsp; It also made me realize that I'd dated a cellist for 2-3 years (Hi Ben) and never got to hear him play cello.&nbsp; I feel jipped.&nbsp; In any case, good company, good acoustics, songs written by Stephen Merritt...&nbsp; what more could a girl ask for on a Tuesday night?   Since there were some friends who we felt should have been at the show but couldn't make it, I had my cell phone at the ready.&nbsp; I had taken 2 requests before the show: Boback (I Don't Believe You, and I really liked this live) and Allen (Luckiest Guy on the Lower East Side).&nbsp; Bob got his, but since they didn't play Allen's, I had to substitute Papa Was a Rodeo.&nbsp; I also called both of them back during the brilliant encore finale: Yeah! Oh Yeah!&nbsp; I left a verse and chorus of Book of Love on Dave's voice mail, and hopefully it'll still be there upon his return to the states.&nbsp; I left a&nbsp;little of Busby Berkeley Dreams with Lisa, who I'm sure was dreaming herself by the early hour of 10PM.&nbsp; I think I accidentally proposed to Romie by calling him with It's Only Time.&nbsp; I've only listened to the new album a couple times, and I forgot that there's that whole "Marry me..." bit towards the end.&nbsp; So I called back with All My Little Words, which seemed more Romie-appropriate.&nbsp; (Romie's migration to Hawaii will always live in my head with lots of sad songs made more sad by random insertions of his name everywhere.)&nbsp; Hope you all heard the songs, as the reception was pretty bad in the theatre.   My two other favorites from the concert: I Wish I Had an Evil Twin, Born on a Train.   I need to get  urlLink i .

      was great.  I shared a room with  urlLink Zack ,  urlLink Ryan , and Jeanette.  I didn't get into AX Idol, and I was a wee bit disappointed at first, but Ryan bought me an incredible espresso martini from the bar in the Marriott, and I was quickly brought back to my cheerful self.  Zack's family visited twice, and the second time we went to Joe's Crab Shack.  My gosh, they have a tasty BBQ dungeness crab.  When I asked our waitress to describe this glorious dish, she said, "You know that stuff they use in Barbeque flavored Corn Nuts?"  I was sold.   urlLink  Cynth ,  urlLink Kenny  and Stephanie all came on Saturday, and we hung out with them and some of Zack's friends from school (pre-college).  Boback, freshly-returned from South America, visted on Sunday night.  Fun stuff.  Anime-wise, I think I did more buying than watching, but I scored some great goods.  I am the proud new owner of 2 Menchi (Excel Saga) plushies, a Kyo (Fruits Basket) hat, a moogle pin, and the Azumanga Daioh collector's box.   urlLink Azumanga Daioh  is definitely my favorite new anime (not my new favorite anime, mind you, Furuba is still closest to my heart).  I liked GTO, Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi, Di Gi Charat...  but none of them came close to Azumanga Daioh.  We rented disk 1 before heading off to AX 'cos we knew we were going to miss the screenings.  (I think they may have been dubs anyway.)  I'm thinking of cosplaying Chiyo next year.  Some say I'm jumping the gun here, but I like to be prepared with my costumes.  I'm tired.  Maybe I'll post more on AX later.  Enjoy the photos.

      So, I haven't posted in awhile.  Fear not, blog readers, when we get back from Anime Expo, there will be much posting, more than you'd probably like.  I've been pretty exhausted from taking several voice acting classes at the same time, getting our costumes ready, etc.  Also I'm entering the AX Idol this year.  I'm not sure how it works, but my portion of it is supposedly a voice acting competition, so I figured I should go for it.  I'm a bit worried that the judges will all try to act like Simon from American Idol.  Now, I only watched American Idol one season, but I actually liked Simon, because he usually points out the flaws I see in the contestants.  But people envision him even meaner than he actually is on the show, and in trying to imitate him, I'm afraid they'll try to rip me apart for the entertainment of everyone else.  I guess that's the point of the contest.  yikes.  wish me luck.  Nevertheless, we are excited over in these parts.  I'm already looking foward to see a few good  urlLink Squelchey-types , getting free swag, meeting Tomokazu Seki (voice of Kyo in Fruits Basket and of lots of other people in other anime), spending far too much on Japanese toys, taking pictures of  urlLink Man-Fayes ...    Until then, have a fun and safe long weekend!

      I've been training a new student employee here at the library, and she's been great. Today, she got even greater in my book (ha ha.  library joke.  hmm.), because she brought me a slice of homemade cheesecake.  Now, cheesecake and I are friends, but I'm picky.  I like my cheesecake creamy and not too sweet, and I definitely prefer Oreo over graham cracker crusts.  This stuff was perfect for me.  She had the recipe memorized, so I post it here for Sarah and Cynth and other people who might want to make this.  for me.  sometime soon.  Ingredients:  3 packs of Philadelphia Cream Cheese (8 oz.) 1/2 cup sugar 3/4 tsp vanilla extract 1/2 cup sour cream 3 tbs flour 1 egg  Mix cream cheese (softened), sugar, vanilla extract and flour.  Stir.  Add sour cream, stir.  Add egg and mix.  Pre-heat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.  Bake for 1 hour in Oreo Cookie crust, made or store-bought.  Janet recommended making it yourself* so you get the Oreo cream in there too.  *to make Oreo crust you need cookie crumbs (mash 'em!) and 3/4 tbs of butter

       urlLink Cynthia  brought a box of choco mushrooms to the Nintendo party, and my gosh, they are yum!  I've seen these before in Japanese grocery stores but never bothered with them because I don't usually like chocolate and biscuit combinations as much as just chocolate (especially strawberry flavored chocolate).  I love  urlLink Meiji .  They make  urlLink Chelsea Yogurt Scotch  (probably my favorite hard candy ever) as well as Apollo strawberry chocolate, and  urlLink other lovely Japanese confections .  Meiji Kinoko Chocolate says: "Buy me!  Take me home!  You won't regret it!"  Cynth, if you got these from the 98 Cent Store, can you get me a few more boxes?  thanks.

      I recently added  urlLink Sarah  to my list of blogs. Sarah is a good friend of  urlLink Kenny's , and not only is she a very nice person with  urlLink good taste in books and British actors , she's a  urlLink foodie  to boot! I asked my best friend,  urlLink Cynth  if she'd ever met Sarah, and she replied that she wished that she had. Like me, she had a wonderful suspicion that she and Sarah would get along well.  So, Sarah, meet Cynth.  Cynth, Sarah.  We'll have to have our own little cook-off one of these days.

      I almost forgot to post about this...  I found the neatest page when I was trying to get ideas for Zack's Nintendo party...   urlLink Pikachu and ham on crackers for me, please!  I'm going to have to start collecting Play-doh molds. (Cynth, Mo says that they used to have Hello Kitty ones, but she might have thrown them out.) The best thing is the comparison photo with all the different cheeses and the Play-doh one as a reference, but don't miss the deep-fried pikachus at the bottom of the page.

      On Saturday, I threw Zack a surprise party for his birthday. Now, his birthday was actually on Thursday, so he was actually surprised to see Boback, Kenny, Stephanie, and Cynthia, who had all driven up from LA, and even more surprised to see them dressed up as Nintendo characters. Our cast:  Boback - Mario (fireball version) Tommaso - Luigi (w/ tail) Dave - Bowser/King Koopa Cynthia - Princess Peach Kenny - Captain N Stephanie - Zoe (SSX3-style) Me - Aryll (in the skull dress)  I made Zack a Link costume to change into. It's the Wind Waker version, partly to match my costume, but mostly 'cos I love the game, especially the character designs. Zack was not too pleased with the tights, but the rest of us thought he looked great, as long as he didn't bend over or sit down.  We went to Everett and Jones in costume, and though people were a bit confused there, Bob was very popular with the kids. We came back for the party, and more people showed up for drinks (Yoshi's Island Ice Tea and Mega Man Blue were the specials) and the 2 fantastic Mario and Pikachu cakes we'd made earlier that day. Meli won the Pin the Tail on the Yoshi game, and there seemed to be a lot of WarioWare going on. Fun stuff. Happy Birthday, Zack.
