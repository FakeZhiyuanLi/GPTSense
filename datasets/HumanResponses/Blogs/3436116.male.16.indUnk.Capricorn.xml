      "In the beginning people had nothing. Their bodies ached and their hearts held nothing but hatred. They fought endlessly but death never came They despaired stuck in the eternal quagmire  A man offered a serpent to the sun, And prayed for salvation. A woman offered a reed to the sun, And asked for joy. Feeling pity for the sadness that had overrun the earth God was born from those two people.  God made time and divided it into day and night. God outlined the road to salvation and gave people joy. And God took endless time away from the people. God created beings to lead people in obedience to her.  The red God Xuchlibari The yellow God Lobsil Vith Many Gods and Angels Finally God set out to create paradise, Where people would be happy by just being there.  But there God's strength ran out and she collapsed All the world's people grieved this unfortunate event Yet God breathed her last, She returned to the dust promising to come again.  So God hasn't been lost, We must offer her prayers and not forget our faith. We wait in hope for the day... When the path to paradise will be opened."  -Claudia, Silent Hill 3 ..........  Current Track: "I Want Love" from Silent Hill 3 OST. ~_~  I want a cup that overflows with love Although it's not enough to fill my heart  I want a barrel full of love Although I know it's not enough to fill my heart  I want a river full of love But then I know the holes will still remain  I need an ocean full of love I know the holes will still remain  And this Swiss cheese heart knows Only kindness can fill its holes I'd love to dry my tears As pain disappears  I need a miracle and not someone's charity One drop of love from him and my heart's in ecstasy The high that is sending me is most likely ending me I need a miracle and not someone's charity, now  Fill up my heart with love Oh you'd be amazed at how Little I need from him To feel complete here and now Stirring within me are, These feelings I can't ignore I need a miracle and that's what I'm hoping for  I need a miracle and not someone's charity One drop of love from him and my heart's in ecstasy The high that is sending me is most likely ending me I need a miracle and not someone's charity, now  Anybody's love but his Will never fill this place within...me now Doctor give me what I need To free my heart from misery.

      Oh My God.. Found this awesome online radio station that plays all the game's soundtrack. Just how cool is that?! Oh fuck.. I'm so into the station that it somehow numbed my hunger. Riggght.  They actually played Z.O.E ANUBIS's Beyond The Bounds! What the hell. Don't tell me you never heard of it, if you call yourself a Hardcore Gamer! It totally rocks! If only I didn't format my main com, I would still have that mp3. And now I can't find any place to download it, Fuc*!  So many albums I wanna get. Z.O.E ANUBIS OST, Z.O.E OST, Xenogear OST, Chrono Cross OST, FFXI OST. These are a few "Must Get" in my list.   Hmm.. talking about games, I realised that I haven't been playing any game for quite some time. Time to drop by the game store to stack up some new RPGs and stuffs, and revive the infamous "Riala" from FFXI. Here I come baby, Riala is coming to conquer the FFXI world, once again. *Grins*

      Been getting lots of weird comments regarding my previous few entries. Rest assure, nothing bad or dramatic has happened to me. It's just something that came into my mind, thus implemented the title, The 1st and 2nd Grey.   Currently Playing: Star-Stealing Girl. It's from Chrono Cross.  Previous Song: Dream of the Shore Near Another World, from Chrono Cross too.  Decided to use the midi format as the file size is smaller.   Next Song: "Small Two Of Pieces - Restored Pieces", Vocal MP3 file.   Small Two of Pieces - Restored Pieces  Run through the cold of the night As passion burnes in your heart Ready to fight, a knife held close by your side Like a proud wolf alone in the dark With eyes that watch the world And my name like a shadow on the face of the moon  Broken mirror, a million shades of light The old echo fades away But just you and I Can find the answer and then We can run to the end of the world We can run to the end Of the world  Cold fire clenched to my heart In the blue of night Torn by this pain, I paint your name in sound And the girl of the dawn With eyes of blue and angel wings The songs of the season are her only crown  Broken mirror, a million shades of light The old echo fades away But just you and I Can find the answer and then We can run to the end of the world We can run to the end of the world  We met in the mist of morning And parted deep in the night Broken sword and shield and tears that never fall But run through the heart Washed away by the darkest water The world is peaceful and still  Broken mirror, a million shades of light The old echo fades away But just you and I Can find the answer and then We can run to the end of the world We can run to the end of the world Run to the end of the world

      Why does art need to be cultivated? Because it cannot be learnt. Learning is a process. It can show you the way other people do things. But the most important thing is what you yourself want to achieve. What is your style? This is something that has to come from you through daily cultivation. The challenge of cultivation is to forget what you have learnt. You needto forget the methods of others, their ideas and their techniques, while retaining the wisdom of learning. If you don't forget, you'll always be hanging onto things that aren't yours. Where can you find the space for yourself? And how can you prevent the shadow of others from falling over your works? The only way is by devoting yourself fully to the process of self-cultivation. This has to begin with your everyday life. It is the process of nuturing back yourself. It allows art and life to merge into an inseparable whole. This is the only way to regain the Self that you have lost.This takes a lifetime of practice. Of course it is not easy to do so. That is why self-cultivation or practice is like planting the seed of art so that it grows to fill the entire person. It is the deep-rooted transformation of everything that you are. It allows art to occupy your whole person and dictate you actions. It enables your every note to become art.  Art occupies your whole person and dictates your every action. You don't need to think about the things you carve or paint. Just follow your actions. That's art. It's that simple.  "The Universe is my Master. Everything I know, I have learnt from Nature. When I think, it is not necessarily about art, but about Nature and Life" - Ju Ming  One way or another, my course have really altered by mentality. Philosophical Mind. I like Art. I like designing. I appreciate beautiful, philosophical stuffs. Maybe it's like what Don said, I'm not committed to my course. Within a month, I have skipped more than half of my classes. I failed my first Interior Technology Project. I'm given another chance, and am supposed to present my work tomorrow. I just wished that they fail me, kick me outta the course. Yet, some part of me still wants to continue on. It is only in this course that I can come in close contact with Art, Designing, or what I called, Beautiful Things.  Had a little fight with Don while he sent me home. He was nice enough to carry my super heavy bag for me and sent me home. He's so sweet,&nbsp;but he started to blabber nonsense as he was very tired.&nbsp;Anger took the better hold of me and I said something which I thought would never be a problem for us, Time.  I've promised it would never be a problem for us. If I can ever use this to dig a fight, it means&nbsp;that my love for him isn't strong enough. Loving someone means loving his flaws, loving his lifestyle, loving who he is, and what he wants to be. Noone is perfect. I will learn to live with it, will you do the same for me Don?

      People of this era who grew up in the romance propagandised by Hollywood blockbusters are severely frustrated with the lack of prospect in finding the "True Love" in reality. We are handicapped by picture-perfect visions in the movie, to the extent of forgetting what romance denotes and contains between two individuals who, before meeting, are strangers on the street.   How sad we are because we are all immigrants in the country we call Romance.   To survive in this country where true love rules and dictates the lifestyle we must adhere to, we should forget about family values and friendships. Friends in this country are people who help us get a dream lover, or they are not your friends at all. Your friends must be either (a) single and try to hunt for the "Man" with you, or (b) happily attached but willing to become your matchmaker so that you can secure the front seat during your journey to the 'Happiness' county.   Also in this country where money should not be an issue, you must forget about your bills because your credit cards will sustain the lifestyle you need to find the perfect man. You can swim across the pub to find a gentleman holding his glass of Gin Tonic and staring at you intently. You look at him, and immediately you fall in love.   In this country, your career is secondary because you don't have to work to survive. Your man will have loads of money to indulge in a variety of food and entertainment fiesta. You can walk into any fashion boutique to pick up your favourite clothing items to impress the Man. Your advancement in your job is not important; your advancement in your marital status is. You should travel from single, to attached, to married. If you have successfully made the journey, you are the first-class citizen in this country. You should ask for no more. If unfortunately you are divorced, then you will have to make the trip all over again, no matter how old you are, or you will become a pariah in all social outings.   In the country where we come from, romance is tied with other factors. But, in the country of romance, it is the ultimate virtue we should live for.   If you have failed in this country, then perhaps you should go back to your hometown, which is widely known as "Reality", which can be quite daunting because romance will become a secondary issue, and you need to pull your strength to survive with other vicious animals which will only be too glad to stampede your back, if you are not careful.   In 'Reality', you have to take care of your family and satisfy your own needs because nobody, except for your parents, will shower his/her love and attention on you.   For most of us who can decide which country we should live in, we are always torn by the ideologies popular in both countries. We want the best of both worlds but we know we cannot secure it. Hence, we are fighting a losing battle. We are disillusioned. We are disappointed. Perhaps, we should choose one, and live happily with the consequences.            Bear in mind, no one is perfect.         &nbsp;     Love ya Don.       &nbsp;   PS: Heh, this is my favorite song. Simply love it. "Small Two of Pieces - Restored Pieces", the ending version. The other version is called "Faraway Promise". The latter one being the more sad, counter part of the other. Two of my all time favorite.

      Kinda weird to see that people still do come to my bloggy even when it's down. Haha, what can I say sia, really touched lor. -Hugz-  Spent the past 24 hours with Dan. Not really the whole 24 hours, just most of the time. Details can be found at his bloggy bah. Haha.  Got really pissed off by my group mates. Damn childish and talk non stop lor. Siao one. "I wanna be with the guys! I wanna be with the guys!" Riggght, whatever bitch. She's lucky I'm not in charge of the group. Not, I would have shut her up and place her to somewhere she dislikes.  Project dead due in like 1130 hours. The clock is ticking, and I'm not even bothered about my not-really-even-started project. I'm really going fail my project. Oh man, still confused if I should drop my course and go for private medical university. Dan would probably scold me if I does that.  Going to Malaysia on 31 July. Bad. Just got to know about it like last night, and they have planned it like 2 weeks ago. Worse. Both my sis is going to bring their other half. Driving two cars. Dammit. If only I can bring Dan. Sigh. Two lonely days..

      Finally took the effort and finish tidying/furnishing up my room after what seems like years. I have been living in a rubbish dump. Yeah tell me about it~  Don't feel the usual satisfaction after tiding up my room. Something is missing. Something is not right. Feeling empty.. I'm afraid..   When it rains, well it rains Oh my heart don't feel the same Nothing change, nothing change Comrade I don't feel the same With my foot to the floor Hear my key turn in the door Holding back what's in store When a  boy  wants a little bit more

      摄氏三十五度 我不再回顾 想你在他的怀里  应该幸福 我该祝福 冷得我想哭 不能哭   傻到什么程度 我心里有数 最后一口啤酒无所谓  酸或苦 能笑着送你走 就满足 很满足   看着天上乌云 满满 排山倒海 这夏季第一场雨  迎面而来 当结局不能改 我又何必躲开  没什么值得大惊小怪 就淋个痛快   听风 咻-咻-咻-嘲笑我的爱 就像感情的备胎  只在旁边喝采  你别问why why why 我一直都在  你有很好的未来 再痛我也说all right   当风 咻-咻-咻-送走我的爱 街边路灯一整排  低着头为谁默哀   是天在 cry cry cry 我的笑还在  有天他不能依赖 你怀念我外套口袋  告诉我 我随时 stand by

      Things have gotten so bad now between me and my dad. We just can't see eye to eye, and I have stopped trying. That's it, I had enough of him. He's so unreasonable and selfish. If he thinks he can control my life, then I think he can go screw the plants. He keeps complaining about me, and the things I do. Whatever bullshit.  He scolded me and said, "I provided you with all the best thing and this is how you treat your dad." What wrong did I do? Bloody fucker. Then he continued saying, "I must tell your mum to write down all the things we bought for you so you will repay us when you're old." Fine. Whatever, I don't need you anymore. I wont ask anything from you again, "DAD". I will use my OWN money to get my OWN stuff. I hate you. I will pay back whatever shit I owned you, you have my words. If he dislike wat I do so much, then why not forget that he ever had a son. He's just half a son anyway!  Like me for me, Hate me for me. I don't care.

      Holy crap! The graphic is superb!! Best I have ever seen or fear to even imagine. You guys should really go watch the trailer. It's so cool!!!!!!!!! The graphic is so good that even words can't describe how I feel.  However I heard the complete anime (Yes you got me right. It's a anime, not a game. Sequel to FFVII) will only come out for PSP console. Damnit, that means I have to buy another god damn console just to watch this awesome anime. But for this, it'll definitely be well worth it. Will do some research and put up my review on PSP and GC game console, both of which I think every gamer should have.

      Finally got this awesome Anime when I was out with Don just now. Way cool dude. Costed me quite a few bucks though. Gonna keep a close watch on my expenses for this coming few weeks... Still got a couple of things I need to get though. Argh, maybe I should get a part time job while waiting for my enlistment..?  Realised that I'm getting worse at expressing myself and my thoughts. I don't really like to express myself now as oppose to the past me. Feeling weird to even write this, like so insecure about ppl knowing what's happening to my life and what I'm thinking sia. What makes it more weird is that I'm feeling this despite da fact that I used love to blog and let everyone knows what is going on. Can someone tell me what's wrong with moi? Alright let's try getting used to blogging life again..  Met Don for dinner yesterday. Actually supposed to meet Virgil for movie one. But everything not confirmed, thus cancelled it. He sounds kinda disappointed though. Sorry Virgil.. will make it up to you another day ok? Hope you cheer up a little, your little devil will always be there for ya. (",)   Have been a while since I last shopped at Lot 1. Bumped into Dunk  there, waiting for his XiaoGou. Haha, the lovey dovey couple. Went to the food junction and had fishball noodle. My fav. Don doesn't like fishballs though. It's tasty and nice what... oh well...  Went shopping around after dinner, got myself Rahxephon Volume 1 and 2. Asked the sales girl there if it's the complete version. That dumb girl flip the box ard a couple of times and said "Nah, it doesn't say The End"  After that went to find Don's Jay Chou album. Seems like we're a little too late, or rather too early. The album's coming out tomorrow, and the booking thing (or whatever that is) is over liao. Don looked so disappointed. Then he forced me to get the album tomorrow by hook or by crook. Fine fine, I will get it ok.. stop reminding me.. >.  Well after that, Don and I decided to hang ard at my place. Showed him some pics of my ex course mates. Surprisingly, Bobby's afraid of him! That poor dog was trying to run away from him. Haha, cute sia.. Played with the tarots too as he wanted to try it out.. He told me some nonsensical rules that his friend came up with abt the tarots. So funny..

      A little update on my life issues. I have withdrawed from my DID (aka Interior Design) course. Decided to go serve my NS first then continue my studies. Primarily couz my lack of inerest in da course, and unclear where I should go to, thus I chose NS. Well, I have always wanted to go NS actually, thought it might be fun rather than studying.  Yes yes, I can hear many of you out there complaining that NS sucks. Oh well, I have 2 years to regret, so shuddup. So basically I'm very free for this few months to come before my enlistment. Jogging, swimming, or any other sports anyone? You know my number. So just call yah?

The tempo, bass.. everything is near perfect! The lyrics are especially cool. Anyone can help me translate the whole song into English? I have no idea what language it is in though.. LoL.. Anyway edited my previous post and added in the lyric for "I Want Love". Find the lyrics quite nice too (",)
