      Terlalu lama engkau tergenang Hancurkan diri kia jauh tenggelam Lelah mencoba tuk lepaskan beban Kau beli mimpi semu tak berarti... sendiri  Tak mampu kau beranjak pergi Jalan yang panjang nanar kau tatap Tak lagi peduli semua yang terjadi Smakin dalam larut anganmu melayang  Mimpimu hadirkan sebuah penantian Alunan hampa ajak kau bernyanyi Akhirnya kau pun pergi... tak kembali   Reff:Banyak sudah kisah yang tertinggal Kau buat jadi satu kenangan Seorang sahabat pergi, tanpa tangis arungi mimpi S'lamat jalan kawan, cepatlah berlabuh Mimpimu kini tlah kau dapati Tak ada lagi seorang pun yang mengganggu  &nbsp;Kau bernyanyi Dalam haru ku hanya sanggup mengingat Jelas bayangmu yang masih melekat Dalam kecewa ku hanya mampu katakan Tetaplah tersenyum, karna itu jalan yang telah kaupilih Terbanglah, oh terbanglah bersama pelangi  Reff:Banyak sudah kisah yang tertinggal Kau buat jadi satu kenangan Seorang sahabat pergi, tanpa tangis arungi mimpi S'lamat jalan kawan, cepatlah berlabuh Mimpimu kini tlah kau dapati Tak ada lagi seorang pun yang mengganggu Kau bernyanyi  Smoga dalam damaimu kau mengerti Arti gelapnya jalan yang kau daki Hingga indahnya bias mentari tak lagi kau nikmati  S'lamat jalan kawan, cepatlah berlabuh Mimpimu kini tlah kau dapati Tak ada lagi seorang pun yag mengganggu  Kau bernyanyi

      &nbsp;  Hello there The angel from my nightmare The shadow in the background of the morgue The unsuspecting victim Of darkness in the valley  We can live like Jack and SallyIf we want Where you can always find me And we'll have halloween on christmas And in the night we'll wish this never ends We'll wish this never ends  I miss you(I miss you) Where are you?And I'm so sorry I cannot sleepI cannot dream tonight I need somebody and always This 6 string's darkness Comes creeping on so haunting every time  And as I stared I counted The webs from all the spiders Catching things and eating their insides Like indecision to call you And hear your voice of treason  Will you come home And stop this pain tonight? Stop this pain tonight Don't waste your time on me  You're already the voice inside my head(I miss you) You're already the voice inside my head(I miss you)

      &nbsp;kadang aku berfikir dapatkah kita terus coba  mendayung perahu kita  menyatukan ingin kita  sedang selalu saja  khilaf yg kecil mengusik  bagai angin berhembus terjang  goyahkan kaki kita  genggam tanganku jangan bimbang tak usahlah lagi dikenang  naif diri yg pernah datang &nbsp;jadikan pelajaran sayang  dengar bisikanku oh kanda coba lapangkan dada kita terima aku apa adanya jujur hati yg kita jaga  mengapa selalu saja  khilaf yang kecil mengusik  bagai ombak yg besar  goyahkan kaki kita  genggam tanganku jangan bimbang tak usahlah lagi dikenang  naif diri yg pernah datang  jadikan pelajaran sayang  dengar bisikanku oh kanda  coba lapangkan dada kita terima aku apa adanya jujur hati yg kita jaga  bila gundahmu tak menghilang hentikan dulu dayung kita bila kau ingin lupakan aku ku tak tau apalah daya

      i'm chatting on msn rite now... i seriously have nothing to do. just finished watching mean girls, it was my aunt's vcd. mean girls is just american high school cliche'... its about the typical nasty girls in high school that are always up to no good and go around bitching about averyone, even they're best friends...well, when they're friends find out all hell breaks loose...huzz....so thats pretty much it. G didn't pick up his phone yesterday...wonder why...gasak dier lah nak buat aper... niwae last night i went out and was going to mac with two of my friends when i saw R... R is my ex, we broke up like 6 months ago i think and guess what, i completely forgot i was wearing the necklace he gave me on our two month anniversary. i don't know why the hell i wore it. i guess i thought it looked pretty and all and it matched my outfit sooo well i just, didn't expect to bump into him of all people... feelings sure began to stir a little last night. well, everythings over now i should just forget about it...right? THIS is what happens when your boyfriend stops picking up his phone and you haven't met him for almost two weeks....other guys start to attract your attention....oh crap...huzz...G y aren't you picking up??? the last time we talked was like 2 days ago... G, G... where are you?  what are you doing now? are you thinking of me? don't you miss me? G....i miss you...

      when my rimba rythm starts to play dance with me, make me sway like a lazy oceon hugs the shore  hold me close sway me more  like a flower bending in the breeze bend with me sway with ease when we dance you have a way with me stay with me,sway with me  * other dancers may be on the floor dear but my eyes will see only you only you have the magic technique when we sway i go weak  i can hear the sound of violins long before it begins, make me thrill as only you know how sway me smooth, sway me now  *   (repeat from start)
