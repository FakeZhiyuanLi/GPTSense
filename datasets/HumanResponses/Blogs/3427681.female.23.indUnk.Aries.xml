      Lene Marlin Disguise  Have you ever felt some kind of emptiness inside You will never measure up, to those people you Must be strong, can't show them that you're weak Have you ever told someone something That's far from the truth Let them know that you're okay Just to make them stop All the wondering, and questions they may have  I'm okay, I really am now Just needed some time, to figure things out Not telling lies, I'll be honest with you Still we don't know what's yet to come  Have you ever seen your face, In a mirror there's a smile But inside you're just a mess, You feel far from good Need to hide, 'cos they'd never understand Have you ever had this wish, of being Somewhere else To let go of your disguise, all your worries too And from that moment, then you see things clear  I'm okay, I really am now Just needed some time, to figure things out Not telling lies, I'll be honest with you Still we don't know what's yet to come  Are you waiting for the day when your pain will disappear when you know that it's not true what they say about you you could not care less about the things surrounding you ignoring all the voices from the walls

      A Letter To the One that God has Prepared For Me  I am wondering at this very minute if you are thinking of me, if like me, you are wondering what is taking us so long to find each other. Many times I thought I finally found you only to be disillusioned by the fact that my wait has not yet ended. I get up each morning hoping, dreaming, longing to meet you.  I am thinking of how we will meet, would it be as romantic as the ones I have seen in movies? Or is it possible that I have known you all my life but we have yet to realize that we are meant for each other? Oh how I wish you were here right now because you are the only one who has the answers to all my questions.  Sometimes I ask myself if I have ever really known "love". I do not have the answer to that question either but I believe that, more often than not, we will never really know what love is until we find that right person.... and since I have not found you yet, then maybe I do not really know what love is!  You just don't know how often I dream of finally knowing what it feels like to be in your arms. Even at this very moment I am imagining how you will simply sweep me off my feet! Perhaps I would be drawn to you by your smile, or your eyes, or maybe even how you manage to make me laugh by your silly little ways!  I don't really know for sure but I am praying that God will help me recognize you when the right time comes. I think of all the pain that I have gone through in the past and of how much I have cried since the day I began my search. I just wanted you to know that I find my strength in clinging onto my vision of the beautiful life ahead of me --- the life I shall spend with you. In my mind and in my heart I know that you are worth all that pain and sacrifice.  After all, the tears have become a part of my life and I believe that they are slowly washing away my flaws so that I would become perfect, not perfect in its truest sense, but perfect --- for YOU! I wonder if you've gone through so much pain as well. I wonder if you've been hurt so many times along the journey.  But my dearest one, please don't ever give up because I am right here... patiently waiting for you! I assure you that when we finally find each other I would slowly heal those wounds by my love.  At night, I would look out my window and stare at the beautiful sky, hoping that somehow you are also looking up and wondering about me. I utter a silent prayer and send all my cries to the heavens above thinking that in time they would reach you. And when I feel impatient, I just close my eyes and believe that you are on your way and that you are longing to see me as well. It is funny but when I finally fall asleep, it is still you that I think of, for you are always in my dreams. It seems that, for now, that is the only place where I can hold on to you, long enough to tell you how much I love you. In my dreams you would kiss away my fears and wrap me with your arms of love.  And this, all the more, makes me want to wake up and face the new day ahead with the hope that soon enough, you will no longer be a dream but a reality and once again I am assured that you are worth the wait.  And when that time comes, everything will fall into its place, just as I had imagined, just as I had thought and dreamed, just as I had believed it would be! By then, I would simply look back and smile at all that I have gone through, in spite of the pain and amidst the simple joys of life --- and I would be very thankful because they all led me to you!  In the meantime, take care of yourself for me. Hold on to our dream and don't even think of letting go. Believe in your heart that we will find each other no matter what happens. God has planned the course and it is up to us to follow the directions. Don't worry, don't be afraid about getting lost, God saw to it that all the roads, no matter which one you choose to follow, lead to me .  -- Contributed by Alma Alvarez   Shared by Joe Gatuslao Bacolod City, Philippines

      While she was waiting for Saint Peter to greet her, she peeked through the gates.   She saw a beautiful banquet table. Sitting all around were her parents and all the other people she had loved and who had died before her. They saw her and began calling greetings to her, "Hello, How are you?  We've been waiting for you! Good to see you."   When Saint Peter came by, the woman said to him, "This is such a  wonderful place!  How do I get in ?"   "You have to spell a word," Saint Peter told her.   "Which word?" the woman asked.   "Love."   The woman correctly spelled "Love" and Saint Peter welcomed her into Heaven.   About a year later, Saint Peter came to the woman and asked her to watch The Gates of Heaven for him that day.   While the woman was guarding the Gates of Heaven, her husband arrived.  "I'm surprised to see you," the woman said. "How have you been?"   "Oh, I've been doing pretty well since you died," her husband told her.  "I married the beautiful young nurse who took care of you while you were ill. And then I won the multi-state lottery.  I sold the little house you and I lived in and bought a huge mansion. And, my wife and I traveled all around the world.   We were on vacation in Cancun and I went water skiing today.  I fell and hit my head, and here I am.  What a bummer.  How do I get in?"   "You have to spell a word," the woman told him.   "Which word?" her husband asked   "Czechoslovakia."
