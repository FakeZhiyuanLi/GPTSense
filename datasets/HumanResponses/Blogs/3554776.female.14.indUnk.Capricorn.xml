      Grrr.. weekends over. I had a shitload of homework last night and was like crying cause i was so tired. English finals happened today which i most likely failed (we were supposed to do 7 out of 10 questions.. i did 4). After school i walked to Taryns house and ate everything there. I dont even ask if i can open her fridge anymore.. its offically my second home. After a hustle and bustle with my mom and brother looking for me (i really wish my mom would get a cell phone) i was driven to the Spaghetti Dinner at my church. Will and Ray made up a new name for me and Laura.. slores. Figure it out on your own. Now im stuck with like a years supply of meatballs and bread. I feel awfully Italian. Well, i have finals again tomorrow and mostly likely another shitload of homework headed my way, so i guess ill go coaxe my faja into taking my to CVS for important reasons. Later dudezeys!  - Izzy (-_-)

      I had the weirdest dream last night. I dreamt that I was at a Dashboard Confessional concert with Annie, only the lead singer guy was really ugly. For some reason I was trying to write "We Love You Chris!" on a poster, but i couldnt because i kept on messing up. I was then in a  giant hotel playing hide and go seek with a bunch of strangers. Am I psycho or what? Dont answer that. Any who, I was supposed to sleep in late today since it is in fact still the weekend. Unfortunately my dad woke me up when he came into the house yelling "HARLEY PASSED OUT". Being all disoriented and shit, all that i could reply was " WwWHAHAa HaRleB SpAssED AwOOt?". Dont worry, Harly is fine. Later- I go to Sparta to play soccer. The drive is long and silent, with the occasional history lesson from my ada about pilots who used to live in Sparta. It is cold and wet and we lose by 2 (YEAH CALDWELL!!). Oh what fun. Then I went to SPY and cried. We had to make spaghetti sauce and I was cutting the onions and started crying and everyone was like WHAT ISABELLE IS CRYING? BUT SHE HAS NO HEART, HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? Yeah, real nice guys. So I made them cut the onions. I found out something new about myself today: I am powered by boys tears. My hands will smell like onions for a year now so anyone who hangs out with me.. I pitty you. Now Im home watching the Tony's and organizing my shit for language. FINALS THIS WEEK. I hate school. Im also going to Razzberries this Thursday to get aburn highlights. CANT WAIT!! Later dude and dudettes.  -Izzy

      w00T w00t  There was a fair at St.Peter's (my church) today. Since it was rainy and cold there was not alot of people there. I remember the whole fair experience being alot more fun when I was younger (meaning just last year) but I guess I've matured to the point beyond.. fun. Haha I hafta say that the highlight of my boring afternoon would have to be Laura McCabe being dunked in the dunking booth by her mom. Other than that my day consisted of odd looks from rish Essex Fellians. Those people scare me. Okay well since I am home and relaxing, I guess i'll go watch some anime DVDs and eat whats left of the goldfish while complaining about how badly my attempted "scrunched" hair looks. Later dudes*   - Izzy (-_-)
