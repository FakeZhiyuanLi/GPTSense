      It's there in the refridgerator, secluded and forgotten  it's lack of luster in color has disoriented it's desirability  it sits there in rejection for days or maybe weeks  until one is revealed behind the milk and eggs  it is suddenly desired after being so extensively redundant  how delightful it feels to feel the cool smoothness touch my lips  the sweet chocolate taste embracing and caressing my tongue  I take diminutive bites, hoping to savor the sweet taste  how could this divine treat ever be unwanted  I place my spoon into the plastic container in pursuit for more  but it is bare... now as is my heart

      i feel so very empty inside and i don't quite know why  it's a strange and&nbsp;different feeling, deep down all i wanna do is cry  i don't even know why im feeling this way  is it something i do or somthing i say?  everything is remotely pleasent in my life right now  i want to fix this feeling but i don't know&nbsp;how  my head is filled with thoughts and worries  all moving in fast motion, everything is blurry  i feel completely friendless, alone, and bare  im always the one left out, and that feels unfair  this feeling comes a lot and always feels the same  it feels horrible but it's only me to blame  i know this feeling will temporarily stray  but it always comes back on it's own random days&nbsp;

      there's this one thing that makes me feel troubleless  to have met him at this time i am truely blessed  he's my best friend and it's him i love talking to  with him by my side it's impossible to be blue  he's everything i want in a guy  i know this after a short amount of time  he has so many great qualities, with them great things he will do  we have the same interests and share the same truths  i love him as a friend and maybe a little more  when im talking to him moments are never a bore  there's not many guys as great as him up here  my only wish was that our whereabouts were near  i miss him so much already, the distance is killing me  just think if we lived near each other, how much closer we would be  even though i love the way he makes me feel  i know it could never happen, i can only wish it was real

      it's raining outside rain is good maybe too good rain strips you of everything negitive in the world as you watch it in pure amazement that God created someting so truly beautiful rain is relaxing the sound in the back of your mind  wipes out all of your thoughts so you can just sit in total and peaceful emptiness rain is silence yet is also so loud rain makes the world around you seem pointless rain is God's warm embrace reviving us  and telling us everything is alright rain cleans your spirit and lets you start over new rain is a gift

      no one knows what it's like to be me no one knows what sets me free everyone thinks im just a shallow prep no one knows my heart's true depth i wish everyone could see the world through my eyes then they would fully understand the reasons why i cry i wish everyone could a different true me but i can't shake the reputation of everlasting glee many times i feel sadness and pain like everyone else but no one ever sees it up on the highest shelf again no one knows what im really about im different from the rest, this i want to shout my deep down feeling never really shows this is why...no one knows

      I wish you would say hi or maybe even wave i wish you would talk to me or just remember my name i wish we would talk more just have a conversation in the hall i wish we would be friends and maybe you would call i wish you would just like me  and then admit you do i wish we would go out i'd go anywhere with you i wish you would hold my hand or put your arm around my neck i wish you would kiss me goodnight  even if it's just a peck why'd we have to do that now we are in a fight i wish we would apologize and save me another crying night now it's time for you to go and i understand why you have meant the world to me i wish i wouldn't cry i wish you didn't have to leave and we never had to say goodbye and the think one day i just wished you would say hi
