      Pretty uneventful week, but I am starting my own RPG  using RPG maker 2003. The title is Seal of the  Ancients: A Hero is Born. I am currently working on  the plot and characters and I have a good bit of  graphics for it. I will post news on it as I get more  done on it. I will also include screenshots and parts  of the story. Thats all that really happened. I also  have a lot of energy all of a sudden. I feel like  getting outside and doing all kinds of things. But  it's getting late so I'll do stuff tommorrow. I write  whenever I can/feel like it/have the time.

      Well, I still didn't get paid today. Now my boss at the card shop I work at owes me $220. Hopefully I'll be getting it tommorrow (plus some extra). I had to sit in the shop ALONE for about 6 hours with only one break. Only ONE person came in. Oh well, everyone comes on Sunday anyway. ---------------------------------- I also took an IQ test about 10 minutes ago, and it said my IQ is 133. I think that's pretty good, I'm not sure exactly. I took different tests before though and they all gave me different results. So&nbsp;I'm not sure what my IQ REALLY is. Oh well, I really could care less. &nbsp; That's all for today, see ya tommorrow!

      Well, sorry for not posting. Instead of telling about myself, I'll just update my profile. Learn about me there. --- Pretty uneventful week, except for yesterday. I got a haircut and saw Spider-Man 2. THAT MOVIE IS FREAKING AWESOME!!! If I had the time, I&nbsp;would have seen it again. But I am moving in about 2 weeks and I have tons of stuff to pack still. That and I am broke. I am owed $140 and have not gotten it yet. I thought I would have gotten it sooner so I spent all my money and now I have about $2 on me. Oh well, I might get the money this weekend. We shall see. &nbsp; That's pretty much it for now. I will post again when it is convenient. &nbsp;

      Isn't that nice? Well, I'll post here whenever possible (if there is something to post). I probably should describe myslef, but I don't feel like it right now, so that'll wait until tomorrow.
