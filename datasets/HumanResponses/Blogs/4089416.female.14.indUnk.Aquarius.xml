       Isn't it strange how well life is going perfect yuo never take time to thank God for everything that you have, but then the second you lose something you either blame it on God or beg him to give it back, or when you do have something you want u go to God and ask him to do it all for you. Isn't it strange how when u have alot of friends to talk to you dont care about the people who mean most to you, but then when you lose all your friends you try and turn back to the ones who care about you even though you ignored them and treated them like jerks. Isn't it strange that the things you seem to hate most in life are the things that will help your life, like doing math homework, or getting grounded for failing a science test that u didnt study for to begin with. Isn't it strange how sometimes your worst enemie becomes your best friend, and your best friends sometimes become your enemies. Isn't it strange how when someones so happy with the thing they have you start to get jealous insted of being happy for them, then start to want something just because someone else has it. Isn't this just all so strange?

       When I think about everything you put me through and all the heart break you caused me, I wonder why I ever thought I loved you. And I wish I never knew the real truth.   You made me smile and frown, laugh and cry, you even made me happy when sad. Cheered me up every way, and even yet didnt stay. Why have I gone so far as to find the truth. Now I wonder how I let this pass me by without ever giving a good cry.   You never held me, never kissed me, never showed me how you felt. And yet deep down still always believed you. Until the day I woke up to find it not to be a dream, but all the heart break to be true.   You made me crash, then said so sorry. Broke me once, tiwce then once more again. You shoock me too me never to go back. Playing along with every little song, never thinking or caring how I would get over it.   Heart broekn, heart taken, heart never given back. I hit my head against the wall while I wonder what I ever did wrong to ruin what I thought we had, and about something I know I'll never get back.    I know you messed me up bad, but why do I feel like I'm still getting punished for your mistakes?!
