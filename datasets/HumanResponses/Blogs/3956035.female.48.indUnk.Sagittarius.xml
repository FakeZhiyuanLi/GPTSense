       Read Genesis 3  &nbsp;  Goals: 1.We can’t hide anything from God   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. There are consequences for our sins.&nbsp; God does not force us to obey Him.&nbsp; We all have to make our own choices about whether we will obey God or suffer the consequences of disobedience.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The devil tempted the first family on earth the same way he tempts us today: lust of the flesh, lust of the eye, and the pride of life (1John 2:16).  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The devil lies. God does not.  &nbsp;  This story will help us to understand what sin is, how God judges us when we sin. The story of Adam and Eve teaches us that even when we sin – even when we do things that God tells us not to do – God still loves us and takes care of us.  &nbsp;  God had placed Adam and Eve in a beautiful garden.&nbsp; He had provided them with everything they could ever want.&nbsp; But God had told them that they could eat the fruit from any tree in the garden, except one.&nbsp; The tree of knowledge of good and evil.  &nbsp;  Satan, the serpent, was tricky and liked to make trouble.&nbsp; One day the serpent (Satan) asked Eve whether or not she could eat from every tree in the garden.&nbsp; She said they could eat from them all except for one, for if they ate or touched that tree they would die. Satan tried to change God’s word and told Eve that it was okay to eat from that tree because it would make her as wise as God.&nbsp;&nbsp; He convinced her that it was all right to do wrong.  &nbsp;  Eve saw that the fruit was attractive, and even though she knew she shouldn’t, Eve took the fruit and ate of it.&nbsp; Then she gave it to her husband, and he also ate of the fruit, even though he knew he shouldn’t.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Everything changed when Adam and Eve disobeyed God that day.&nbsp; They felt shame, and they realized that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together to cover their nakedness.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Adam and Eve heard God walking in the garden, and they felt afraid because they had disobeyed God, so they tried to hide from Him.&nbsp; When God asked where they were, Adam said, “I heard you coming and I hid because I was naked”.&nbsp; They knew they were naked because they had disobeyed God.  &nbsp;  Adam and Eve began to make excuses and to blame someone other than themselves for their disobedience.&nbsp; Adam said, “The woman you gave me made me eat it”.&nbsp; Eve blamed the serpent.&nbsp;&nbsp; God cursed the serpent above all animals so that he must crawl in the dirt and slither in disgrace.  &nbsp;  God’s punishment for Eve was that she should be subject to her husband, and that she would suffer pain during pregnancy/childbirth.&nbsp; To Adam, God gave physical hardship.&nbsp; He would have to work and grow his own food in order to survive.&nbsp; Up to this time, the earth yielded as much as they could eat.&nbsp; But now, it would yield reluctantly.&nbsp; Man would have to work hard.&nbsp; There would be thorns and weeds.  &nbsp;  For their sin, death now would eventually come.&nbsp; God said He had made Adam from the dust of the earth, and one day they would return to dust when their body died.&nbsp; God made some clothes out of animal skins for Adam and Eve.&nbsp; Then, because of their sin and disobedience, God made them leave the beautiful garden that he had made especially for them.&nbsp; At the East end of the garden, God placed special guardians (cherubims) to keep anyone from entering the garden ever again.&nbsp; A revolving sword-like flame assured that no one would re-enter and have access to the garden and the tree of life.

      Read Genesis 8 & 9  Noah and his family were safe inside the ark.  After 150 days, God made a wind pass over the earth, and the waters started to go down.  The Ark landed on the mountains of Ararat.  This is a high mountain range in present-day Turkey.  Mt. Ararat is 16,916 feet high.   Forty days after landing on the mountains of Ararat, Noah opened the window of the ark.  First he sent out a raven to see if the waters had dried from off the earth.  Then he sent out a dove, but the dove couldn’t find a resting place and returned to the ark.   Noah waited another 7 days and sent out the dove again to look for dry land.  This time the dove returned with a freshly plucked olive leaf in her mouth.  Now Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth.  Noah waited another 7 days and sent out the dove again.  This time the dove did not return, so Noah knew the earth was once again dry.   God spoke to Noah and told him and his family to go out of the ark onto dry land.   All of the animals went out of the ark also.  God told them to be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth.  No living person or no animals that were on the earth survived the flood except those that were safe within the ark.  Noah built an alter and offered sacrifices to God on the alter.  He offered the clean animals for the burnt offering.  Noah worshipped God and was thankful to God for what he had done by saving him and his family from death .  The fumes of the sacrifice going up to God pleased Him.   God promised that He would never again destroy the earth with water.  He placed a rainbow in the sky as a visible sign of this promise he made.  When we see a rainbow in the sky we should remember the everlasting promise that God made that He would never again send a flood to destroy the world. We should keep our promises just as God keeps His promises to us.  Have you ever seen a rainbow?  Have you ever wondered what a rainbow is made of?  It is made when light and water meet in the sky.  A ray of sunlight hits a droplet of water and the light reflects off the water.  The rain is like a prism, splitting the white light into the colors of red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet.  In 1 Peter 3:20 Jesus says that those who don’t pay any attention to God, and don’t obey Him, will not be saved.  But those who love God and obey Him will be saved, just as Noah and his family was.  So Noah and his wife and Shem, Ham and Japheth and their wives were told by God to populate the world.  So from all those that were on the ark, the whole earth became populated.   In time, Noah planted a vineyard.  He drank the wine and became drunk.  He lay naked/uncovered in his tent.  Ham saw his father naked, and mockingly told his brothers.  But Shem and Japheth took a garment and covered up their father’s nakedness without looking at him.  When Noah became sober, he blessed Shem and Japeth for doing the right thing.  But Noah cursed Ham and his descendants.  Shem, the oldest son, received the birthright.  He became father of the Jews/Hebrew nation.  Jesus would come from Shem’s lineage.  Japheth became father of the Gentile nation.  Ham, who was Noah’s youngest son, became father of the Canaanite nation.  Their land was later repossessed by the Jews/Hebrews.  They became servants to the Jews/Hebrews, just as Noah had said.  Noah lived to be 950 years old.

      Read John 3:1-36  Goals: To help us understand the necessity of the new birth (baptism). To show God’s great love toward the world.  Nicodemus was a very important man. He was a ruler of the Jews, and a Pharisee. A Pharisee was a man who knew Old Testament scriptures and  followed strict, formal traditions of the Old Testament.   Nicodemus was one of the few religious leaders who believed that Jesus was a teacher that came from God. He had seen the miracles that Jesus had performed and he recognized that the miracles came from the power of God. Nicodemus wanted to learn more about this man named Jesus. Nicodemus did not want people to know that he was a believer/follower of Jesus, so he secretly went to see Jesus one night.  Jesus explained to Nicodemus that in order to go to heaven, he would have to be “born again”. Unless we are born again, we can never be a part of the kingdom of God. Nicodemus was confused by what Jesus had said. He asked Jesus,” but how can a man be born twice?” Jesus explained to Nicodemus that the first birth is a fleshly birth, like when you and I were born in the hospital. This fleshly birth placed him into the earthly, Jewish kingdom. In order to enter into the kingdom of God, he would have to be born spiritually through baptism. This is the second birth.  Jesus taught Nicodemus that in order to enter into the kingdom of heaven he would have to be born spiritually. In Galatians 3: 26-29 Jesus says that baptism puts us  into  Christ (v.27). He taught that it isn’t enough to just KNOW what the Bible says, but that it is necessary to OBEY what the Bible teaches. Our faith demands action, because faith without works is dead (Ephesians 2:26).  We see that action in Jesus. He came down from heaven to this earth. He was lifted up on the cross. He was buried and then He rose again so that we would believe. By believing we can have life in His name (John 20:31). He offered His life to save the world from sin and death. God loved us so much that He sent His son to die for our sins (John 3:16).  This new, spiritual birth must be brought about by water and the Holy Spirit (John 3:5). We become children of God through the act of baptism. He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but he who does not believe will be condemned. (Mark 16:15,16). So anyone that does not believe on Jesus will never go to heaven.  We must:   Hear :  Romans 10:17  Believe  : Hebrew 11: 6; Mark 16:15,16  Repent  : Acts 2:38  Confess : Matthew 10:32  Be Baptized : Acts 2:38; Mark 16:16  Live Faithful:  1Corinthians 10:12; 2 Peter 2: 20,21  After Jesus was crucified, Nicodemus was willing to openly stand up for the son of God and joined with Joseph of Arimathea in burying Jesus. He brought spices to anoint the body of Jesus. Nicodemus did believe and he was a child of God. (John 19:38, 39).

      Read Genesis 6 & 7  Goals: 1.  We need to continue to be faithful to God, even if we are the only one. 2.  If God is for us, it doesn’t matter who is against us.  Man began to multiply and increase on the earth, but they had become very wicked and did not love God.  Their thoughts and actions were not how God wanted them to be.  God was forgotten and rejected by these wicked men.  God was sorry and disappointed that He had made man.  So God decided to destroy all the men and animals from the face of the earth.   There was one man, named Noah, who found grace (favor/acceptance) in the eyes of God.  Noah was a good man who wanted to please God. He lived a holy life.  Noah and his wife had 3 sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth.  God would spare the lives of Noah, his wife, their 3 sons and wives from the great flood that was to come. Just 8 people were saved.   God told Noah that He was going to destroy all the evil men and all the animals on the earth because of man’s wickedness.  God said He was going to bring floodwaters upon the earth to destroy the earth. He instructed Noah to build an ark.  God gave Noah specific instructions of how to build the ark.  It was to be made of gopher wood, 3 stories high (45 feet/30 cubits); 1 ½ football fields in length (450 feet/300 cubits); and 75 feet/50 cubits wide.  A cubit is thought to be about 18 inches, so the ark would have been about 45x450x75 feet.  To make the ark water tight, Noah used pitch on the inside and on the outside.   It took Noah and his sons 120 years to build the ark.  During this time, Noah preached to the people about God (2 Peter 2:5).  But the people did not listen to Noah.  When the ark was completed, God told Noah to take 7 males and 7 females of the clean animals and birds; and to take 1 male and 1 female of the unclean animals into the ark.  He had to bring enough food for all his family as well as for all the animals.  Noah did everything just as God told him to do.  Noah was 600 years old when he and his wife, their 3 sons and their wives entered into the ark.  The Bible says that God shut the door behind them (Genesis 7:16).  Suddenly the heavens opened with torrents of rain from above the earth.  It continued for 40 days and 40 nights, flooding the earth and completely covering the highest mountains.  All flesh died on the earth, every man and every animal.  They were all destroyed from the earth.  Only Noah and those who were with him inside the ark were safe and remained alive.  After 150 days, the waters decreased.

      Read Genesis 4 & 5  Goals: 1.There is nothing we can hide from God. 2. God continues to love us even when he has to punish us for our sins.  Adam and Eve began their family. Their first child was a boy named Cain. Their second child was also a boy and his name was Abel. Cain was a farmer like his father Adam and tended the crops. Abel was a shepherd and took care of the sheep in the pastures.  One day both brothers brought special gifts to God to express their gratitude to Him and to honor and worship Him. Cain brought some of the fruits or vegetables he had grown as an offering to God. Abel brought a sheep from his flock as his offering to God.  God was happy with Abel’s offering , but God was not happy with Cain’s gift. Hebrews 11:4 says ‘By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain…’ Abel’s offering was more acceptable to God because of Abel’s attitude and faith when he offered it.  Cain became very angry and jealous of Abel. God knew how Cain was feeling and warned him not to allow his temper and the sin in his heart to overtake him. Cain needed to take control of the sin rather than to allow the sin to take control of him. He needed to do what was right and not do what was wrong.  But Cain allowed his anger and jealousy to lead to violence. One day Cain and Abel were in the field together, and Cain murdered his brother Abel. The Lord asked Cain, “Where is your brother?” Cain answered, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?” (Genesis 4:9). He didn’t have to keep track of where his brother was all the time. Cain showed disrespect to God by his answer.  Of course, God knew what Cain had done. He asked Cain, “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground”. God punished Cain by making him a wanderer upon the earth. He would travel from place to place. The soil would no longer produce the fruits and vegetables as it had before.  Though Cain’s life was spared, he complained to God that his punishment was too great to bear. He was afraid that his enemies would kill him. God was merciful towards Cain. He placed a mark on Cain to indicate that he belonged to God and must not be harmed. God would severely punish anyone who harmed Cain. Even though Cain had sinned, God assured him of His continuing presence.  So Cain left and lived East of the beautiful Garden of Eden in the land of Nod (land of wanderings). Cain and his wife had a son named Enoch. The descendants of Cain were: Enoch; Irad; Mehujael; Methusael; Lamach; Jabel/Jubal/Tubalcain.  Adam and Eve had another son by the name of Seth. It was through the lineage of Seth that Christ would eventually come. The lineage of patriarchs from Adam to Noah were:  Adam 930 years Seth 912 years Enos 905 years Cainan 910 years Mehalaleel 895 years Jared 962 years Enoch 365 years Lamech 777 years Noah 950 years  The names of Noah’s 3 sons was Ham, Shem and Japheth.  Enoch, the son of Jared, pleased the Lord in every way. He pleased the Lord in thought, word, actions and his attitude. God loved Enoch so much that he took him up to heaven without his having to die first. (Genesis 5:24). His disappearance was sudden and unexpected (Hebrews 11:5). Enoch was able to continue his close fellowship with God without any interruptions.  Enoch’s son, Mathuselah, was the oldest man to ever live. He lived for 969 years before he died.

      Vacation Bible School is over for another year. This year Angela, Juanita and I taught the K-1st grade class. Our theme this year was "Targets For Christ". We talked about Jesus' birth, childhood, miracles and his crucifixion & resurrection. I'm posting the lesson I taught on Saturday morning about Jesus walking on water.  Source: Matthew 14:22-33; John 6: 16-21  Jesus did many miracles while He was on earth. Today we are going to talk about something Jesus did that to us may seem impossible. But it really happened!  Does everybody know what a miracle is? (Illustrate the laws of nature: what would happen if I let go of this piece of paper?) Talk about the purpose of miracles - why did Jesus perform miracles.  So they would believe that he was the son of God.  The disciples had had a very long and tiring day. The evening had come and the disciples got into their boat. They were going to cross onto the other side of the Sea of Galilee to a town called Capernaum. (John 6:16). Jesus didn't go with them because he wanted to spend some time alone to pray to God.  The boat was in the middle of the sea. A storm had come up and the wind was tossing the waves around. It was now the middle of the night. They hadn't been able to get very far because of the storm. They had only rowed about 3 or 4 miles. Suddenly, the disciples looked out into the darkness and they saw someone walking towards them on the sea. The disciples thought they had seen a ghost and they cried out in fear. Jesus saw they were afraid and told them "Fear not! It's me, it's Jesus".  Peter may have wondered if it really was Jesus or just their imagination, because he said, "Lord, if it is You, tell me to come out on the water with you". And Jesus said, "Come". Jesus didn't tell him "No Peter, you can't do that." He said just one word, "Come". It must have taken a lot of faith for Peter to take that first step out of the boat. It was the middle of the night, so it was dark. There was a huge storm, and the wind was blowing and the waves were tossing the boat around.  But the Bible says that Peter stepped out of the boat, and he walked on the water to go to Jesus! But then Peter started noticing the wind and the storm going on around him, he was afraid, and he started to sink. He cried out , "Lord, save me!" (Mt 14: 29,30). And immediately Jesus stretched out his Hand and caught him.  Peter was doing fine until what?.... he took his eyes off Jesus. As long as he kept his eyes on Jesus he walked on the water toward him. But when he became distracted and started to notice the wind and the storm that's when he began to sink. Peter lost faith. He took his eyes off Jesus, and he began to sink.  When Peter cried out, "Lord save me," the Lord was immediately at his side, reaching out to rescue him and bring him to safety. Jesus told Peter he should not have doubted. We need to learn to trust God and realize that he has everything under control. When they got back in the boat, everyone worshipped Jesus saying, "You really are the son of God".  What did Jesus do when Jesus called out to him for help? He immediately reached out to help him. We need to remember that, just like Peter, when we call out to God to help us, he will always be there when we call on him for help. Just like he was for Peter.
