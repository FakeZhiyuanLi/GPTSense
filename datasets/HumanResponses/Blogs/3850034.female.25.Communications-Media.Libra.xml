      Now and then, I would do a crass (if not hilarious) Chinese adaptation of English songs. Some of my prized works include Baa Baa Black Sheep, Do-Re-Mi, and now, "Top of the World". Sing to the tune of the song! The lines don't quite rhyme but hey, the meaning does correspond. Enjoy.   Top Of The World (世界高峰)   Such a feeling coming over me 有种感觉拥上我心头  There is wonder in most everything I see 我看到的事物都是奇迹  Not a cloud in the sky 天上没有云朵  Got the sun in my eyes 眼中充满阳光  And I won't be surprised if it's a dream 如果这是梦也不奇怪  I'm on the top of the world 我站在世界的高峰  Looking down on creations 看着地上的事物，  And the only explanation I can find 而我找到唯一的原因就是  It's the love that I've found 我得到的关爱  Eversince you've been around 自从你的出现  Your love puts me at the top of the world 你的爱让我站在最高峰

      Escape...  into the concocted fiction of tv dramas into the arms of your imaginary perfect partner into the twilight realm of isle beach into the breezy car ride along ECP into the warmth of your comforter into the unbridled surf in your dreams into the make-believe fantasy of tall stories  where who you are does not matter where what you can do is unrestrained where how achieved you are is of no concern where life's many questions need no answers where the colours you see are richer and warmer where weight defies gravity where you are the lead you want to be.
