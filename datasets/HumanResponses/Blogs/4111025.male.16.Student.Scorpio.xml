       Tunes:  Lostprophets - Last Train Home  Eats:  Gum     This has been one hell of a week. I probably should have posted earlier. Anyways, the first order of business:  The title. There was some wisdom passed on to me (via an episode of Scrubs) that there is a point in the relationship between any two people, where one could have made a move, but was spoiled for some reason. They then have forty-eight hours to make that move, or they shall spend eternity as just friends. Unbeknownst to me, I squeezed in before the clock on Audrey and myself ran out, but here I am, clock run out, and somehow right back where I started. So Michi, Audrey, Joel and myself are all hanging out in Linda's basement. I put my arm around Audrey (no biggie, right?) when Michi suddenly gets violently jealous, and winds up storming off. We caught up to her in the car, and everyone went home. I haven't talked to her yet, on advice from Linda, but I'm rather baffled as to what's going on. I'm getting a lot of "jealous, huh? she so wants you!" but she'd go for Audrey before me. Actually, Audrey and Michi have a strange relatioship.... maybe they're closet lesbians, as I thought long ago.  My mom decided I needed a haircut. Something about "looking like a damned hippie". I always liked having long hair, and it wasn't causing problems for anyone else, so I fail to see the problem. The thing I really hate about getting it cut, though, is that they always cut off too much of the back. It feels weird running aroung with shoulder-length hair for the better part of the year, then going to nothing hanging lower than your jaw (where my bangs used to be.) Why, oh why, can I never find a hairdresser that listens?  Last weekend (use of the previous two words prove I should update more; even if this is my second post) Snowball came to town. It's abundantly clear that she would have been here when Ben was, if at all possible, but it's all good. I'm just chewing myself out for jumping right in the middle of the time they did have at the cottage. *struggles to get back to topic* En route to my place, her bag fell apart, and I proceeded to carry it on my back, being no easier way to carry a handleless rollie suitcase without wheels. We spent too much time talking about music (including why John Mayer deserves to be figurehead of a cult) and I got talked into watching Mona Lisa Smile, or so I'm letting her think. I'm actually impartial to the occasional chick flick, but it would spoil my rep as a badass if the ladies knew that. *rolls eyes* All in all, it would have been nice if she could stay longer. Oh, and if you're reading this, Shireen, you still owe me that game of pool. *winks*  Aloha!  Me: (singing) There's still tomorrow, forget the sorrow, and I can be on the last train home... Nik: What is it with you and 'Last Train Home'? Me: (not thinking) You're the last train home. Nik: That's right. Everyone gets off.

       Tunes:  DI.fm - Trance  Eats:  Orange Juice    By all rights, I am, in the classical sense. But that's not what the name of the post refers to. That refers to the fact that I have no idea what I'm doing on this site. I've only ever read one other person's blog, and was never the most literate person, but something has compelled me to fill out a bunch of forms, and spill my guts.  If you think you know me from the title, you don't. There isn't even an Eighth Street in town; that's just random silliness at the top of the page, and forever in my URL. I'm going to regret that later. But I'm sleep deprived, so I'll have fun with it while I can.  I stayed up all night. Again. And I have a hell of a time getting back to sleeping at night. But, I'm heading up north to see Snowball at her cottage in.... *counts on fingers* four hours, so I figure I'm better off not sleeping, and chancing annoying someone, than sleeping through my ride. Snowball lives in Ottawa, and just needs to get away from things there, so she's coming down here for a couple days. Because of her parents' paranoia, I get to drive for four hours up to Barrie, where she is now, so her parents can make sure I'm not the type to molest or unleash other evils upon her.  Jono's ex, Christine, drove in from out of town, and she's passed out in the other room. She rocks. How many girls do you know that can keep a conversation about porn going for the better part of an hour? (That's entirely unrelated to the awesomeness, but a rarity nonetheless.)  I got her MSN addy, so I think we'll definitely be keeping in touch.  Well, my mind is drifting. I pre-congratulate myself if I ever remember to touch this site again.    Jono: I went to look for a shock collar for Lindsay's dog, so that thing would shut      up. Can you believe they wanted 160 bucks? Me:   I went to look for a shock collar for Lindsay, so that thing would shut up. Can      you believe they wanted 160 bucks? Nik:   I went to look for a shock collar. Can you believe they wanted 160 bucks? Me: Why did you want yours? Nik: For wearing, stupid!
