Well I was getting sick of crawling around stealthily, having to worry about being outnumbered and watching my stamina and all that stuff. So I lauched up  urlLink  Unreal Tournament 2004  . It was such a relief, to go blazing around the maps, slaughtering enemy after enemy, and taunting them ("You SUCK!")... 
 
Okay fine, I died a lot more times than I actually killed anyone. Basically, I did about a dozen deathmatches against bots set on the highest difficulty, "Godlike." Yeah, Godlike, whatever. Out of about of 10-13 Team DeathMatches, I won 3 of them. Haha...  Okay, fine, I still consider myself "Inhuman," because I still have yet to defeat these stupid Godlike bots. They're just lines of code, for chistsakes! I'm a human being, the product of millions of years of evolution! They're just the products of a couple of years of development at Epic! My brain is capable of parallel processing that programmers can only dream of creating! Why can't I defeat them? Bah, I was  so  insulted, hearing several times, the bots taunting me as they mowed me over, "Your programming is inferior," or, "Flesh is a design fault," or even "You play like a girl!" So offended. I just felt the urgent need to pick up a flak cannon (the Realistic Tournament 2004 equivalent of a super-shotgun), charge right up to one of them, and just give it to them in the gut, and watch their body parts fly off across the room. 
 
Plus they cheat. They can dodge a lot faster than I can. There's this problem with Unreal Tournament, in which the dodge (which is basically a strafe-jump for about 6 feet) is done by the key command of double-tapping the movement direction. Unfortunately, there seems to be about a 500 millisecond (that's half a second, you clods!) delay from after I press the command to when I  actually  do the dodge. So while I'm there, clumsily attempting to dodge side to side to make myself a godlike jumping/shooting/murdering machine, all the bots can just invoke the dodge (UTMovement direction, UTPlayer player) function, and in the same time that it takes just for my character to respond to my double-tap, they can do a dodge from side to side  twice . I'm not kidding, I've seen in happen. Eh, I'd probably just corner myself into a wall anyway... 
 
Here's a little taste of the action. Is there a screenshot button in UT2004? I don't know, so I just took a regular screenshot. Because it puts the image on the clipboard, I can't really take more than one screenshot at once. Sorry. Well, here it is. I set all the graphics to the highest, even with my system, and it still runs at very playable rates. The Unreal engine has somewhat outdated graphics, however, and this shot isn't a very good one. Hah, I imagined taking a screen of me with the flak cannon, right in the middle of blasting someone into 50 pieces, but after being killed several times, I gave up and settled with this one of a (unusually, particulary since he's supposed to be "Godlike") stupid bot running straight into a storage container, all the while suicidally setting off a huge explosion right in his face. Very, um, anticlimactic. 
 
 urlLink    
You can see my aim was off, as I was temporarily distracted by having to reach allll the way across the keyboard to get the screenshot... 
 
You know what's strange? I checked, and found out that the domain names realtournament2004.com, realistictournament2004, and realistictournament.com are all unclaimed and available! Although  urlLink realtournament.com  [realtournament.com] is taken, it's just an image of some text saying "Real Tournament" against a black background. Oh well. You could claim realistictournament2004.com, make it really popular, then get tons of money from Atari's lawyers as a settlement in a court case that'll make headlines on Slashdot! Yeah, I know what you're thinking,  screw you, Justin , so I'll just be going now.

If you haven't noticed, all my titles are either nouns or pronouns... I'm very proud of that... 
 
Just Kidding! (Or as I like to say, Justin Kidding! Okay fine I just made that up now because I accidentally typed "Justin" instead of "Just.") 
 
But I will continue to use nouns anyway. But that's not the point. I came up with this thought, and I immediately rushed to blog it because I cared about  you . 
 
Okay fine, I did it out of selfishness; I didn't want to forget about this awesome thought. 
 
Well first, they should create self cleaning keyboards. For example, they could use fans! After all, if they can do it with a  urlLink mouse  [nyko.com], they could do it with a keyboard! Firstly, it would keep your hands cool as you typed. But another advantage is that they would be self-cleaning! No more taking DustOff and spraying it manually! You can just blow all those crumbs from your Togo's sandwich, or all that cat/dog hair that they always leave around just by being  near  it, off to the side into some hidden, removable tray! 
 
By the way, I'm so disappointed. I couldn't grab a screenshot of the very last cutscene, the ending for the entire game, but it's really cool. I played through the thing three times, desperately pressing "Prt Scr" and F12, but for some reason, I couldn't get a screenshot. But anyway, Val and Jack are on a boat, getting away from the island, and she somehow obtained, and snuck off of the island, a file folder filled with papers and CDs. The file folder's name? In big red letters: "OPERATION FAR CRY". What a nice way to end the game. 
 
Well I only said that because it popped up in my mind. My second great thought comes from the fact that sometimes, you have keyboard shortcuts (like Windows+E opens Explorer), but sometimes you have mouse shortcuts, like Toolbar Bookmarks (or a Favorites List in Internet Explorer). What's up with that? Why can't people just make up their damn minds as to which I/O device they want to be the center of their computer already? 
 
One thing that pisses me off. Well not really. But it is a distraction. I constantly save my work. Writing papers, or working in Yearbook, I just have this nagging impulse to press Ctrl+S all the time. Unfortunately, in Blogger, Ctrl+S is a shortcut for  Publish . Grah. Why couldn't that be  Save as Draft  instead? (That's Ctrl+D) Graaah. I just did it as I finished the last paragraph... Bah. Grah.

I finished  Far Cry  today and thought it would be nice to show you some screens... These screens actually aren't that good... they don't quite compare with a lot of the other things I've seen in the game, but... oh well. 
 
 urlLink    
This the last level, with an extremely low detail level. Even so, it looks great. Really that only thing wrong with  Far Cry's  engine is that my computer can never seem to catch up on the anti-aliasing, even when the AA is turned all the way up.  
 
 urlLink    
In the center of the last level (a volcano), there's this massive structure, which I'm walking on. This is still on the low graphics settings. 
 
After awhile I wanted more screens to publish. This time around, however, I turned the graphics all the way to the highest. This last level is very dingy anyway, and there really isn't that much to see. So the screens aren't very great, but at least you can see, that the CryEngine is at least comparable with the engines for Doom 3 and Half-Life 2... 
 
 urlLink    
One last look over the volcano before I go get my final revenge. Um, yes, you're probably looking at my arm right now, which is green and scaly. You see, Doyle betrayed Valerie and I. He told us to the anti-serum that would protect us from becoming infected, but instead, it actually was the infecting serum, so Val and I were turning into Trigens ourselves... (the evil scientist tells me later, see below, that he never made such a serum... only Doyle has one, which kept him alive. 
 
 urlLink    
These screens, as I've said before, pays no respect to how good the game  actually  looks, and some of the maps are just mind-blowing. Here, the graphics were turned all the way up (I think while fighting, the FPS dipped down to something like 2). Still, a lot of the maps were incredible, a lot more beautiful than these screenshots. I had to reduce the size to 640 by 480 because I can't publish such large images...
 urlLink    
With my gun to his head, Doyle realizes he shouldn't have betrayed me after all... (Low Detail) 
 
So yes, the game's ending actually has the boss fight  first . After I kill the boss (the evil scientist), he tells me with his last dying breaths a terrible secret, right before I discover that Doyle, my guide throughout the game, has betrayed me. Stupid bastard. So I go find him. The ending is basically him backed up in a small room, right before I kill him. No problem... real easy. There was an armory right before the level, but, as you can see from the screens, I used an ammo cheat, because I kept on dying... 
 
Temporarily, I got my 5.1 speakers back, but that's only at the request of  urlLink Wayne Huang . It took a long time to set up, and all the wires are all long and jumbled up and messy. That's the problem with 6 channel speakers... they're just so damn messy...

We all know  urlLink RealNetworks . Ah, the past. First, there was the tentative double-click-to-open-it-up-in-Windows-Media-Player. Then we discovered RealPlayer. But then what about  urlLink Winamp ? Last came  urlLink iTunes , and the battle rages on today. Since Winamp, they've, really, been nothing more than a little lonely shortcut icon, never double-clicked, only to sit there, reminiscing about the glorious past, now gone. Well, Real wouldn't have that happen. A few months ago, Real tried to make a deal with Apple, but got turned down. Then, last month, Real cracked the iPod and AAC format. Then they launched their own music store,  urlLink Rhapsody . But now, they  still  aren't finished. They're at it again, making a big KA-BOOOM, with their limited-time  urlLink 49-cent per song deal . No one knows how much longer it's going to last, but it can't be forever. 
 
Now anyway, if you were an iTunes-ian, would you become a RealPlayer-ian? Just for the 50% price difference? 
 
It's a great attempt, and it does emphasize the point that the iTunes Music Store isn't going to be a monopoly forever, but if it were me, I still wouldn't. RealPlayer 10 still isn't as neat as iTunes. Plus there are some gripes I have with it. Mostly it's with the fact that to create my Library, I have to scan my hard drive, rather than having any features where I can just "Add Files." Instead, I just ended up opening Explorer, then dragging it in. 
 
And besides, the price cut won't last. One last fact is that while I can play songs from Harmony on the iPod (I don't have one, though), Apple is going to come up with some way to continue their monopoly. The next generation iPod likely will workaround Real's hack. So yes. Sorry Real, but, to me, you're still second-generation.

So far as programming goes, I'm now expanding my  urlLink Encryption  program, into Encryption 0.3. As of current, I'm debugging my new algorithm I want to implement. Emboldened by my "success" with Encryption 0.2, I took the entire README file and encrypted it. Whoa. Then I encrypted it back. One fundamental problem with the way the 0.2 algorithm worked was that it didn't support carriage returns or tabs. The result was that when I converted it back, everywhere in which a carriage return was supposed to be, I found only a black rectangle that looks something like "[]". That little character is what I recognize to be a marker for a carriage return, but also for exotic characters that Notepad (or Windows even) doesn't recognize. 
 
So in this iteration of Justin's programming, I tried to add support for backspaces and carriage returns. As you can see, however, this proves to be a little different. Take a look at the  urlLink ASCII table . For many of you, you don't give a crap about my algorithms, so bear with me. The 0.2 algorithm goes from numbers 32-126, inclusive. But Tab and carriage return are numbers 9 and 13. There's no easy way to cycle through that. My current solution is to create generic numbers 30 and 31 to represent 9 and 13. Then, when the algorithms decrypting, if the numbers are 30 and 31, it'll reassign them to 9 and 13. Currently I'm having trouble getting all this right, but I'm sure that once I crack it, I'm done with the hardest part. 
 
So really, my "new" algorithm isn't really new, per se, it's just an expansion of the old one to make it more complex. This new one also uses the extended ASCII set, but not all the way because those wonky symbols probably won't show up in Notepad, anyway (although I do know for a fact it it  will  show up in cmd.exe. I noticed that while debugging the 0.2 algorithm and I kept on getting those weird characters). For your information, it goes up to 165 ('&Ntilde;') 
 
After that, I also want to add greater functionality to it, by adding options, after the encryption (or decryption), to see if the user wants to print the document out (with confirmation prompt), or view it (no confirmation prompt), without having to leave the program. Also, I want it to be completely bulletproof. Error checking will be everywhere and anywhere something could, in the name of god, go wrong. I won't add a GUI. I don't think I'll fix that bug where after decryption, there are a bunch of random letters still. That error I was aware of, but gave up on trying to fix, while working on 0.2. It's caused by how the password is still iteration, and adding itself to the file's characters, even if I've already eached the end of the document. It's just the way the relationship is between the inner loop (add password) and the outer loop (end of document). The last thing I want to do is to add two more menu options to the main menu. Rather than having "any other key to quit," I want to just have menu option 4, "Exit" (with confirmation prompt). Also, I want to have a menu option 3, "About" or "Read This" or something like that. It will contain the entire README, as well as the history (and other information) of cryptography, how the algorithm works, as well as some words by me about the making of the program. It's a bit extreme for something so stupid, but I'm very anal about being professional. 
 
More about being anal. In the Encryption 0.2, I had intended on having the README for the Light Edition to NOT have the part about the included source code, but for some reason, it was. Also, the way it extracted, it put the README and the program folder in the directory, which I found annoying, which I'll have to fix. 
Of course, I will include all the algorithms, with my test executables as well as the source code to them all. Also, I discovered that my password masking executable was rather fruitless. It was a nice example, but I'll modify it so that it has a better purpose. 
Okay,  this  is the last thing I'll tell you about what I want to do with encryption next. I want to format the entire code so that it adopts to Justin's latest code standards. I switched to monospace font, so the code that I wrote with my previous sans-serif font now goes past the page. I don't actually plan on fixing the horizontal space, because it's acceptable. The only thing that really go past are comments and long paragraphs (like Annoying Notice 1 & 2). Yes. It  is  very easy to get lost in that sea of black, blue, and green (for me, it's mostly green [smile]). That's why the reformatting is necessary. So basically, I'll just be fixing the formatting. For example, if there aren't any parameters, then there's no space between the function name and the parameter list, but otherwise there is. Also, I'll be working with alignments because I like seeing everything in neat little columns. I talked about this before, but it was a long post, and so I won't link to it. Was it a long post? I don't remember. But basically I want to clean up the code. The last thing you want to be doing, especially when your brain is hard at work on some problem, is for your brain to have to devote resources to trying to figure out what you really are doing. 
 
Once I finish this, I will move back into the foray of creating games. At first, it'll be very simple. The first thing is to write my tic-tac-toe heurstic. Then my rock-paper-scissors heurstic. Then, I will move into OpenGL and attack via the space shooter clone. 
 
That is my plan.

Hmm... IBM is creating 18 800 new jobs, a third of which will be in North America. That's good. Maybe it'll help out with the economy a bit. No thanks to the current president. 
 
Politics aside, I want to talk about commericial stuff. "Commercial" meaning both "advertisements" and as a synonym of "proprietary." 
 
I saw that commercial again that I  urlLink talked  about a bit a few days back. Well, it turns out that it was a  Best Buy  commerical, so, sorry Circuit City. Also, as I can just  hear  grammarians squabbling about this, I must note the difference between a  puppet  (as I so described it), and a  marionette  (which it actually was).  urlLink Puppet ,  urlLink Marionette . There. Difference noted. Sort of. You see, the third alternate definition of a puppet is "a marionette." But difference noted anyway.  
 
Well, that type of commercial is gone. Now, let's talk proprietary software... 
 urlLink MoodLogic  is something I heard about. I create playlists on the fly. You can pick a song, then click a "Mix" button, and it will automatically create a new playlist with similar songs. Or, you can create a new playlist based on it's Genre. Then, from there, you can choose it's mood.  
Here's a screenshot. 
 urlLink    
Windows doesn't capture the mouse for screenshots, so I'll tell you right now that "Get Up" was the mix that was made, and my mouse was hovering over, and therefore the tooltip belonged to, "Relax." 
It's really cool. Except unlike Winamp or iTunes, it's not free. Doesn't that suck? It's 30 dollars. Another problem with it is that it goes through your entire hard drive searching for music files, so trivial things other than songs, such as a sound effect for a project, are put in there. I don't know if it can play songs by itself, because I installed a Winamp plug-in, and so it plays in Winamp. I don't really want to have two instances of something just to play music, but that might just be my own problem. It offers to "Fix" songs for you based on their large database of songs, but often they're incorrect. You can see, for example, that it labeled my "Don't Fake This" by Chevelle as "Point No. 1" Because I don't have the full version, I don't know quite so much about another feature of MoodLogic, where you can "share" your music library with other people. You can't actually have other people's songs, but you can listen to "samples" of it when you choose a mix? I'm probably way off, but there's something like that. Although MoodLogic's GUI looks strikingly familiar to that of iTunes, or, basically, Mac OS X windows, it lacks in eye candy, most noticeably the ugly, squashed font, as well as the lack of eye candy for the window buttons (the minimize, maximize, and close buttons dont react at all to being hovered over or clicked). But, still, it is something that looks outstandingly cool. If I could, I would get it. But I won't. Haha. 
 
And why not a little bit of advertising  and  proprietary stuff? Hmm... well this popped up on Slashdot today:  urlLink The AOL Op  urlLink timized PC [two links, geekzone.com, aolcheckout.com, respectively]. Here's the thing. 2GHz Intel Celeron. 256MB of RAM, and a 40GB ATA 100 5.4K RPM. It comes pre-installed with Windows XP and the AOL Office suite. Basically an okay system for home use. Not anything I would use for games, or Photoshop even. But perfect for home use as a matter of fact. Funny thing how it got released right in the advent of the back-to-school selling frenzy. But here's the real killer: it's 300 dollars. Perfect, no? That's right, no. If behind dark cloud, there's a silver lining, then, facing the other direction, behind every silver cloud, there's a dark lining. If you buy this PC, you are bounded to a 12-month AOL subscription. Mmm... I know what you're thinking,  Hmm... so sending out CDs didn't work, eh?  It sure was mine. But our second thoughts would probably differ. Mine was  Oh, god, no. While open source software is encouraging the next generation of computer users to be smarter with computers, this is just another one of those things that encourages computer users to stupider . I don't really mean, like, really, stupider, but it's...   user-friendly . Yes, that's a good euphem- term to put in. Well, it's a perfectly  good home computer, but with it's integrated 2.1 audio and 32MB video, ball mouse, lack of a dvd drive, lack of firewire, 250W power supply, and, most importantly  AOL Subscription , I sort of get the feeling of cheesiness that I got from seeing that Disney Dream Desk PC for kids. Shudder.  
I know that as we speak now, thinking of "stupid computer users," you instantly think of these 90-year-old grandparents sitting together searching for the power button, or, for that case, your parents. Yes, it  is  a funny vision, but in reality, even many hip, young dudes (like me) have an understanding of the computer that goes no farther than hunk-and-peck, point-and-click. Now just imagine. Ball mice go out of production altogether. Integrated graphics and sound are no longer acceptable for the latest software, even if it's just Notepad, because of the extreme eye candy. Hard drives will all be at least 80GB and go at at least 10K RPM. 512MB will be the standard amount of RAM to have, 1GB will be "plenty", and hardcore gamers will have 2GB or even 4GB. Users would slowly become smarter and smarter, until coding becomes an essential skill..... tech support would be obselete... thousands of jobs would be lost... an economic recession would occur... but then miraculously brought back up by the massive amounts of jobs being created with the greater need to manufacture better computer hardware... 
 
Yeah, I made that all up. I honestly don't believe any of that last portion (starting from where "Users would become smarter and smarter...") will ever happen. Anytime soon.

Hmm. I played  Far Cry  today for just about 5 hours. It's an awesome game. It's totally immersing. Well, sort of. Allow me to explain. 
 
The graphics are some of the best we've seen so far, other than those of Doom 3 and Half-Life 2. The AI is great. But you know, all that makes for a very hot computer. Now, you know my rig, it's in  urlLink the huang identity . It's basically a lower-middle end system, because I was too shy to blow off all my parent's money. I've overclocked just the videocard, using  urlLink PowerStrip  to just about... um... well I don't remember, but I think it's somewhere around 275-300%, yet it's still very stable. Well, because of that, I've been able to play all my games at playable framerates with the eye candy turned up to levels that most wouldn't expect a system of my caliber to do. And there's no exception made for  Far Cry .  So, let's put two and two together... overclocked videocard + high graphics settings unacceptable for a lower-middle end system = ? Yeah, it's really hot. You know my case. It's in  urlLink the huang identity . It's a really nice case. It's got five fan mounts, but I chose to get a neat mouse rather than a fan. You know my mouse. But I'm not linking to that post again. Well now, one of the fan mounts in my case is on the side, by the window panel. Without a fan, it's a vent/blowhole. With one, it's a fan, so I slightly win either way. So with this vent/blowhole, you could imagine that air comes blowing out of it, and since it's on my desk, and facing me, I can really feel that air. Unfortunately, it's hot air, as you might have picked up by now, and really, when I'm playing a level that takes place during the night, and I'm RIGHT by an ocean, I'm not quite sure that I'm quite so immersed anymore once I feel that warm ocean breeze. Warm? Exactly. It's just like playing in another world, then all of a sudden your mouse cord gets stuck on something. Such a drag. 
 
The other problem is that it's summertime. It was fine, playing, in the beginning. I blocked out that stupid skylight that got installed in the room, closed the windows to prevent ambient noise from cars and trucks, and little kids talking to each other noisely as they bike past, and the blinds, and closed the door. Fairly dark, pretty much no moniter glare. But of course, very stuffy. Somehow, I'm sure that some of that damn summer heat leaked into the room. I say "the" room because my computer isn't in my room, it's in a totally seperate room that acts as my workspace. Well anyway, you'd think the stuffiness and the heat would be bad enough, but remember that hot air? The one blowing out my case? Yeah, well that kind of gets trapped in the room, especially with the window closed. After a few hours, I got up to open the window. I was lucky. Not many cars or little kids going by. But even with that, I had to close the blinds, which seemed to still cancel out the open window. But that was necessary to keep the room dark. I didn't last long. At the fifth hour, I finally gave up. I was very dehydrated, and sweating from the back of my head, onto my neck. As I quit the application, I could almost here my computer give a sigh of relief. "Ahh... oh Justin, never play  Far Cry  again..." 
 
And after five hours, you'd expect that I'd at least finish five levels. But I didn't because I got stuck on ONE STUPID LEVEL because I couldn't figure out where to go next before some of those genetically engineered supermonkeys jumped up and mauled me. The whole time, I knew  exactly  where to go, but couldn't figure out how to get get there. I ended up just getting in a car, roadkilling the monster-monkey things, and following the road in circles until I finally found something that I  hadn't  driven past 6 times already. And yes, the checkpoint save told me I was going in the right direction. I was relieved. I entered the building ahead. It was real dark. Blood was smeared on the walls. Then I entered another room, and had a split-second to see two monkeys before one of them mauled me again. This took awhile, too. I discovered that grenades work very well against them. In the end, I just opened the door, threw a grenade in, then ran away from the beasts before they could tackle me again. Shudder. 
 
Now for a slightly more intellectual topic rather than games. 
 
In Microsoft Visual C++ 6, I've been using a small sans-serif font, but I've recently decided to use a monospace font. The reason why I like sans-serif fonts is that they're a lot easier on the eyes, and actually don't look like crap at small sizes (though I think they do at larger sizes). Serif fonts, however, are just the opposite. They look better at larger sizes than smaller sizes, and are a pain to look at either way. Because they look better at larger sizes, I can fit less code on one line, or even one page. But I've been using Courier New at size 9 now. Size 9 isn't like Microsoft Word size 9. It's still quite readable. So now here's the whole layout. Sans-serif: fit more code. Monospace: alignment. That's right. I did it because of alignment issues. For example, it's a lot easier to conceptualize what my output will look like in the command line, because the command line window is monospace as well. Second, the code just  looks  neater. Imagine if you can tons of different data types. You don't want your code to look like: 
 
int theMenu; // the menu  
bool isMenu; // is menu?  
char whichMenu; // which menu?  
JustinsClass newMenu; // new menu  
 
ect, ect, ect. Then it becomes difficult to just look at it and understand it. Rather, you must look at each individual one in order to understand the entire thing. That's just like a puzzle, which you don't want. Rather, you want the complete picture, the puzzle all done for you. So it should look like this: 
 
 
   
 int   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   theMenu;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   // the menu 
   
   
 bool   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   isMenu;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   // is menu? 
   
   
 char   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   whichMenu;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   // which menu? 
   
   
 JustinsClass   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    newMenu;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   // new menu  
   
  
 
Now isn't that easier to read? Now, with fonts like Tahoma or MS Sans Serif, you   could  do alignments like that, but they wont necessarily be able to line up perfectly, because, for example 'W' is a lot greater in size than 'i'. 
 
I know what you're thinking... Justin's so anal about his code. And he his, sort of. He still hasn't set a style for the top header, and pre-function comments, though, but HE WILL (once he finds one that someone else uses, likes it, and decides to copy it).

Well I don't really remember if it was a commercial for Best Buy or Circuit City. I've honestly forgotten. I have a poor memory, you see, and I saw the commercial a few days ago, but hadn't thought of this particular concept until now. 
 
Well, anyway, a puppet, strings and all, walks into the Best Buy/Circuit City. A salesman asks, "Can I help you?" The puppet wants a laptop. The salesman shows him one particular laptop, discussing it's built in wireless antenna. The puppet interrupts, amazed, "Wait, wait a moment... did you say... wireless?" Then he dreams of being wireless himself, running on a grassy plain, totally devoid of wires at all. 
 
Well, you know, I don't know about the Best City/Circuit Buy Commercial, but in the so-called real world, we call wireless puppets ROBOTS.

A couple of things... 
 urlLink    
This is me. 
 
 urlLink    
No really,  this  is me. Sort of. It's the only image of me that I have on my computer. It's what I imagine I will look like in 2057. 
 
 urlLink    
And this is me in 2067. 
 
This image is actually a photomanipulation that I made a while ago that I submitted to  urlLink deviantART . You can view my gallery  urlLink here . I haven't submitted much, mainly because deviantART's a side hobby of mine. deviantART's pretty big. They must pay A LOT for server space because they have about 7.3 million or so deviations. Note that poetry and prose are also accepted, in addition to artwork. It's a great place. The people there are all very friendly. 
 
I have another side hobby,  urlLink Slashdot . I don't use the journal there, because it just gets deleted by Slashdot. Otherwise, it's a pretty cool place. 
 
I have a rig housed in a 27-pound steel monolith, the  urlLink Antec PLUSVIEW 1000AMG . It's meant to be a file server, but oh well. To keep the cost down of this slightly-up-to-date, but still lower-middle end system, I actually only have  one, puny 36.7 gigabyte  hard drive, the  urlLink Western Digital Raptor , but it goes at 10,000 RPM. It's an AMD Athlon XP rig. Because of that, I can use the nForce2 chipset, which is basically the coolest chipset in the world. It has integrated audio, the only integrated audio in the world that's worth a damn, and accordingly, just as good as the  urlLink Creative Labs Audigy 2 Soundblaster . Of course, I still have a floppy drive that I stole from my old system, because I needed it to install drivers. It's a 500 watt power supply, which is cool because I never have to worry about running out of power when I get more, and better components. I have a 52X CD-RW, and an 8X DVD-RW, both by  urlLink Plextor . 512 Megabytes of RAM by  urlLink Crucial , and lastly, (these are in no particular order because this whole time I've been peering into my rig to see what I should type about next) an  urlLink ATI Radeon 9600SE  for my videocard. Oh wait, there  is  one more thing, and that's my motherboard, an MSI K7N2 Delta. I love MSI's red PCB... Then there's the other stuff. I have SONY MDR-W08 headphones or, Creative Labs Inspire 5.1 Speakers, an HP generic multimedia keyboard that came with an old HP that sucked that my brother bought some years ago, and a Logitech MX510 optical mouse. 
 
My email is  urlLink moc.liamG@gnauh.y.hitsuj . As of this post, I am 14, and I live in Saratoga, California. Don't spam me. You will feel the terrifying wrath of Justin and Google combined, which isn't plesant.

Okay, I understand that my first post was a bit abrupt, so this is the "real" starting point here. This blog is essentially a second-coming to the Justin Blogs&tm;. No wait, it's actually the fifth, but one of the was  minor , I swear! Well now onto the main points because I do have a tendency to ramble, though it's a good way to fall asleep.
 
   
     CSS:  
    I chose this very nice template. You can view the CSS in the source code. I, however, prefer not to have a blog that looks exactly like 12.5% of the blogs out there, so I will, slowly, modify the CSS, and as I do, I, in addition, will modify the code format (bracing, spacing, comments) to my own personal preference. For example, I have changed the bracing style from the  urlLink "One True Bracing Style" [Everything2.com], the favored style of C programmer grandpas (it's actually not  that  outdated), to my hip, young, Allman Style, favored style for us hip, young C++/Java kids. But that's not important. It is to me, but the most important thing is how the place looks, and rest assured, once I'm through with it (which I never will; it's just an expression), it will become your calming, online refuge from work and worry.
   
   
     Comments:  
    One unfortunate thing about this service, Blogger, is that it does not allow for on-the-fly user comments. If you actually want your name to be there, you have to be a registered member of Blogger. The best I can do for those of you who aren't Blogger members and don't want to go through all that free registration trouble for such a stupid blog, and most likely, such a stupid post, is how I've enabled Anonymous posting. This still doesn't allow for your name to be there, it'll instead by "Anonymous", so when you do that, be sure to append your name/alias at the end of the comment, or otherwise, make your ego so large and noticeable that your identity's easily guessed. Because it's quite hard to do so, I think it would just be a lot easier to just leave your name. 
Now just one thing - I am  the  Great Justin. I have powers. Secret powers. You can swear and attack me if you want in the comments, and I won't edit it out/delete your comment, but I personally know how to make entire sentences out of swear words to attack someone, so yeah. The line's somewhere around there.
   
   
     The Random Thought Generator:  
    A little while back I programmed a Random Sentence Generator. Expanding on it's vocabulary, it could become a Random Insult Generator, or, in the most recent case, the Random Deep Thought Generator. Note that while I speak to you of this RDTG, it is actually fake, a figment of my own twisted imagination. So if, at anytime, I make reference to a "random thought" I had or, as would be written in the post "currently am having", note that it is not a real, computer generated deep thought, as I have since ran  urlLink DBAN  [sourceforge.net] on the hard drive carrying the only known copy of it, and have never made any attempts at rewriting it. Instead, the "random thought" isn't actually random, it's something very deliberate that I decided to post. So we understand that, correct? Well we'll just see, won't we?
   
   
     Content:  
    Think what you will of this place, but this actually will be a surprisingly  intellectual  blog for some parts, especially those where I have some sort of random thought that I must tell the world about, yet I WILL still make it quite readable, funny, and, as I've already stated, your "calming, online sanctuary from work and worry".
   
   
     Typos:  
    I make those a lot, and I never check my work, unless it's right there in front of my face as I notice it. You can point them out to me, then make fun of me for it in the comments if you want, but it's not like I'm going to actually go back and fix it or anything. Unless it's terribly and greviously simply just a horrible, horrible mistake, like: 
 ("Governor Bob visited the Bay Area today to celebrate the opening of 7 new power pants.")  ("pants" instead of "plants").
   
   
     Adverbs:  
    I use those a lot, too. For example:  
 ("Unless it's terribly and greviously simply just a horrible, horrible mistake...")  
You can point them out to me, then make fun of me for it in the comments if you want, but it's not like I'm going to outline, diagram, then create concept charts of all my sentences in the post...
   
 
  
That's it. I've written far too much for a second post. You see, I have a tendency to ramble a lot. I also have a tendency to repeeat things that I've already said, as well as a tendency to reuse words, even if I've already used them IN THE SAME SENTENCE.

You thought you slaughtered me, but I'm still alive!  
Okay, end of first post.
