       urlLink    Basilica di San Pietro&nbsp; urlLink     The eternal city...one of the places I would love to visit again. Rome, after spending alomst 20 days in Rome, I just cant get enough of it. One of the reasons why I sudenly started to rethink my position on past lives was my experience in this big city. Not once did I went around with a map, or brought out a copy of Lonely Planet..of course we have to look fabulous, after spending hours each morning getting dressed and looking good just to get covered by a humgous map. But even without a map or a guide, I sorta find my own way to my destination...It was like my knowledge of the place was a priori. It was there ever since...But is that possible? This opens a whole discussion of sorts... (guess thats why Ive avoided past lives) One what sustance carries these "memories"? Why aren't we conscious of these "memories"? what happens to your "memories" when you die? This goes on and on...are our minds, constructs of ideas or a material substance? It just goes on and on...So I best stop, that way I could atleast rest tonight.  Ciao

      "You attended a gay pride last night? Hope you take pride at that!"....I got this message waiting for me last night when I got back from work, yes I know it was a Sunday, but we had to work, coming from the party last Saturday I went straight to work Sunday and never got the chance to check my YM.  How would you react to such a narrow minded nitwit? Admittedly I was at a loss for words myself...here I am, getting a message from a guy who I met in "the" chatroom...and has the audacity to tell me "You attended a gay pride last night? Hope you take pride at that!"...Well as a matter of fact YES I DO TAKE PRIDE IN TAKING PART OF THIS YEAR'S GAY PRIDE!...  But I'm thankful, had I not received that message from a halfwit ignoramus I wouldn't come to this epiphany. To me it was like any other night in malate, meeting friends, cheering and partying. I guess the only difference was people greet you "Happy Pride" and the party was on the street and not in one of the bars...But was that the only difference? It's Gay Pride for Christ-sake!, It's a celebration of diversity and individuality! Question is am I proud? and you know what? last night? I WAS! It took someone's comment to make me realize that I should be proud! Why would I let what other people's perception affect how I see my world. It is my world, not theirs, never was nor will ever be!

      The title of my blog is Thinking...but why is my mind in such a  disarray...nothing seemes to come out.  I remember my teacher back in grade school telling me to just type  ellipses when you seem to have run out of things to say .......... .................................................................. .................................................................. .................................................................. .................................................well I still have nothing to say.....................I think I'm just wasting my time  pressing the keys on my keyboard coz nothing logical seems to be  flowing from my head.   I need a theme...a theme for the month perhaps...or for the week... hmmmm any suggestions? please....

      Why on earth did I pick this name for my blog address, well hmmmmmm honestly it just popped in my mind when I started this. But come to think of it "Res Cogitans" or the Thinking thing. Our existence is dependent on our ability to perform cognitive tasks, these cogitations are that which affirms our existence, which brings me to why I am writing...with working and all the things that has happened in my life, certainly it will not hurt if I spend a few minutes a day to think and write my thoughts down.

      I really don't know why but Blissful Ignorance has stuck to me like a stamp on envelope. I'm not even sure why on earth am I putting my thoughts on this while I could have atleasts started a draft for my thesis or some other stuff I need for work. Though I've always loved writing, I think it's my first time to actually type it out...I sorta like doing it the old fashion way, meaning a leather bound journal, an ink well, and a feather quill. I guess one reason why I never like posting my work is because of the way I write...a good friend of mine once told me that my weakness in writing or talking for that matter, is I tend to always take the high-almighty position. At least I don't use "Hear ye! Hear ye!"  that I guess would be way too much... Well on to my first "blog". What does it mean anyway? I got an invite to join this thingy and here I am writing all this foolishness on my computer...and worst posting it on the web for all of G/god's creation to see. Maybe blog is an acroymn for something like..."Boring Life on Google"? Isn't anyone surprised by the wonders Google has brought to this G/god forsaken world? I mean everything in on Google...I would be surprised if you can find your Calvin Klien Whites being sold there...soiled and unwashed...eeewww...or It could be "Beliefs and Lies Online Gateway". Alright alright...stop...  Blissful Ignorance wouldn't be great to just live in pure ignorance? Like life? Some people hate death and what more knowng when they're gonna move on to the great beyond. See wont it be good just to not know. What about if your partner is cheating on you? Hmmmmm believe it or not, its better not to now...People say I can handle the truth...Truth is its better not to know.... Knowledge, is such a powerful force in the world...But only a few know how to use it...  Well I think I've spent enough time writing my debut BLOG (whatever it means)post...  Ciao

      I don't know if God is playing some&nbsp;cruel trick on his creation by letting another re-run of the Straight Talk episode air this afternoon. And by God's good grace I was able to bare witness to such insanity. I am beginning to ask myself if Darwin was actually correct...In the animal kingdom those guest shouldn't have survived their first week of life much less reaching&nbsp;the&nbsp;age of reckless wonder.   A caller said it best "Your guests are really gorgeous and talkative, but they have nothing good&nbsp;to impart&nbsp;to&nbsp;the Filipinos" and that I am sure includes the Filipino-Chinese as well. The episode talked about how these 3 Filipino women of Chinese decent and how they have broken away from the "stereotypes".&nbsp;Was there a stereotype to start with? The shows researchers should be brought to Luneta and shot, but it would just tarnish the heritage of our national hero. I can not for the life of me, comprehend such twisted logic be allowed in national television. Enough of that...As I've said it wasn't one of the shows in my highly regarded list.   Now the guests...Here is what I can say, I will translate it in English but the passion and spirit of my thoughts were expressed so eloquently in Tagalog "Saang lupalop ng tinubuang lupa nahanap yang mga ining na yan" ( where on earth did they find those girls? ). They are just dense...The host actually asked them what their greatest frustration was, I&nbsp;would guess that&nbsp;they were actually deliberating between,&nbsp;"That I'm not a blond." or "I wish I was present when Ms. (whoever) was discussing the meaning of frustration."   ACKK! Anyway enough said...Ciao!   p.s...i cant help it i need to write this..王八蛋！！！！

      I was watching Straight Talk the other night on ANC, and thankfully it was a re-run or else I would have flooded them with calls and emails. Well I never really liked the show to start with. So I wouldn't even go there....But the shows guests were appalling...Simply horrendous. If you were, by some unfortunate freak of nature happen, to watch it. You&nbsp;might question&nbsp;God&nbsp;for giving you ears and eyes only to suffer the experience watching the show. I could go on and on all night trying to say what I feel about the 3 guests of the show but I think I shouldn't even waste my time trying to put to words my horror and disgust.

I was so bored one afternoon that I decided to take a Philippine Airlines A330 and flew it all the way to Hong Kong. I have been planning to try the Sinagpore-LAX route on the A340-500 of Singapore Airlines...but its just too long for me...sitting infront of&nbsp;my computer that long will drive me nuts... Anyway just thought I'd share...

      I'm so uninspired these past few days. I dont know why. Actually I don't even know what's up with me. Its like everything is a routine. Life is a bore...actually the only time I find myself happy is when I start reading a new book I got the otherday. It's actually nice...but I want to savour every bit of it, maximum 3 chapters a day...The last time I picked up a book, I finished it in 2 days and I hope this time I could enjoy it a wee bit longer.  &nbsp; Well another exciting thing that happened last week was when I started writing&nbsp;a story, The first of several ideas&nbsp;I have been playing around for months. Its a bit foreign foreign though...but I hope to have it posted somewhere once it gets edited...I have so many ideas at one certain point of time, that sometime&nbsp;it gets&nbsp;very erratic...but too tired to go over my work anymore...so I need someone who could actually read through it...and make the necessary corrections... &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Yahoo! Sucks! Yes I know...I am sure alot of guys out there have the same problem and alot of you have encountered the same problem I am encountering...Its just sucks!  Ive been using a Yahoo! paid service for over a year now, paying with my credit card then suddenly they tell me my credit card was invalid. I tried changing to my other creditcard but still they said it was invalid...they I placed an overseas call, they said that I can't use my Philippine Issued credit card...But my other friends can use thier cards...why not me? So I decided to call again...(40 cents a minute!) Then this guy who answered the phone said, "Well we have 50 Million subscribers so I dont think theres not much I can do to help you with your problem."   Yahoo's got my work life on hostage right now...but the aren't even helping me fix my problem because they have 50 million susbcribers....Thats like saying, you can go ahead and sell a spoiled can of corned beef because there are others that arent...Its just so frustrating that you cant get them to fix a simple problem...and Lord know there are people with worst problems than I have.  Yahoo! Sucks...and even if I saying it 1 million times or even 50 Million times, one for ever subsriber I know (and I am guessing they know this too) that I will still use Yahoo!....

      ...At least there are other guys who turn a year older before me...You guys know who you are....  The past year has taught me a very good lesson in life, and I begin my birthday blog by writing down a quote summarizes my learning. Its in Chinese, there might be errors in writing it down so please bear with me. I also tried making an English translation to approximate the meaning of the quote...So you might just want to take a look at that instead  "千金難結一時之歡，一飯竟郅終身之感。蓋愛重反為仇，薄极反成喜也。"  " One thousand pieces of gold will not earn a moment of true friendship, but a simple kindness like offering a meal may earn a lifetime's gratitude. Love if taken to extremes, can arouse enmity, while a trifling can turn resentment to joy."   It is just funny how this old Chinese saying resonates until today.....
