      Was one of the worst days of my life. I'm not going to go into too much detail, but lets just say my brother attacked my mother, my father, and his wife with guns. Not just attacked em, but loaded em and pointed it at them and threatened to kill us all if we called the police. But that's just what I did.  Everyone has huge bruises, there's damage to the home, the property, the truck, and to the sense of safety I once had here.  The police came in droves when they did, 10+ cop cars in full swat gear. It was the safest I've felt in years. But now I can't sit here comfortably without being ready for a quick exit if for some reason he comes back.  If he's let out early again, I will be leaving. I can't stay in the same area with him and feel safe with my life.  I'll talk more about the details in real life.

      Going to go ahead and get the maintenance done. It's already scheduled and they already have a rental for me etc, so it's just going to be easier to get this done than worry about searching for a month or more just trying to find a deal that makes the alternative worth it.

      And spoke with the saleswoman about options, and the price seems to be a little gouged right now from what I got mine for and what my mom paid for hers.  I got mine and it was 12,3 sticker priced and my moms was around 11k, but she also got a 1000 dollar loyalty discount.  well sticker right now she said is around 14k, and they currently have a 1500 rebate, which would bring it down to 12,500. That's not good enough. This would be our third car bought there in under 3 years, and the price cannot have gone up that much on a car that has been the same model after model.  So unless they can come down, or my dad can find a dealership willing to not rip us off right now, the best bet is going to be having the maintenance done.  Honestly I've been hoping to get the maintenance done because my car is halfway paid off, it's been a great car, and it would be great to keep it till it was completely paid off and then go and trade it back in on a new car. Or even keep it after and not have payments. Both are nice options that fill me with the love all things Shatner.

      Well I spoke with my dad about the huge chunk o unhappiness. He said not to remove the schedule of me having the maintenance done and to call AS in Tyler and see if they have any deals or anything right now we can take advantage of. With 2005s coming out I may be able to get a decent chunk taken off a new car, although in that case I may have to wait a month or so until they are actually released if they aren't yet.  I spoke with the guy at the service center and they have scheduled a rental car for me for Monday if I still have it done. Any other times I've gone they haven't been able to, so it's nice the guy is going out of his way to help me. Rental car paid for by them so I'm not gimped into staying there and sleeping in their service center all day.  I just called the woman who sold my mom her car (would have called the guy who sold me mine, but he's since moved on) and she was out to lunch so I'm going to have to call back.  I dread getting a new car because my crackhead brother will see it, and without knowing the reason throw a fit and start shit like he always does. If we do this it's going to be, because it's cheaper than having the almost thousand dollar maintenance done but he's not going to be able to understand that. He's going to see new car for me, and think my parents are assholes because they won't help him with his FOUR FUCKING FELONY CHARGES OVER THREE MONTHS.  I hope he goes to jail, I hope he gets raped for the rest of his life.  I don't have any interest in gay porn, but I would set up a theatre screening of my brother getting raped.

      So I called a few moments ago about getting my car into the shop for it's 60k mile check up. This is the most important one in the life of my car. If I miss this, I lose my warranty, which as already saved me a couple hundred in replaced parts.  So I call and talk to the guy, and I'm expecting abut 400-450 maybe a little less or more, but generally around those numbers.  He informs me that the time belt is part of the scheduled maintenance now and it was not included on my original schedule, which I can understand, my original schedule is 2 and a half years old. So I'm thinking ok, one more thing isn't too bad.  So he schedules, and calls me back double checking the name the car is registered under. I ask how much it will be, he says he'll get a detailed list and call me back. He calls me back and says around $900.  So once I stopped shitting my pants, I stopped and called my dad to see what we need to do. For that much (over 3 full car payments) it may just be way more worthwhile to trade my car in on a new one.  So surprisingly enough I may have a new car by this weekend. Cause $900 is a damn bank buster right now since I have negative 2.41 in my Hibernia account.  just waiting for my dad to call back to see what I need to do, I'm pretty sure he's gonna tell me to go see how much I can get. Hope he can come with me tomorrow or Friday, because I'm not nearly as uncomfortable with car people as I used to be, but still, I'd feel much better if my dad was there to keep me from getting screwed.

      Well I have had a hard time trying to think up any kind of blog subject the last few days. Well as I woke up tonight, and rolled over, I remembered my dream, but it didn't quite realize what it was about. I almost started falling back asleep when it hit me like a shoe box full of lead. Needless to say I'm awake now...A couple hours of sleep like usual. I guess I'm just screwed for a while with little sleep, and some great memories of things that didn't really happen.  I'm not sure where I was when the dream started but I remember being at a small circular pool. It was her, Girl A, and her sister, Girl B , and me and some really well built guy who made me feel like I was a small stain on someone's windshield. I was basically just sitting kind of on the other side from everyone being completely embarrassed about the way I look.  I don't really remember what got it to this point, but her sister was sitting on sort of an outer part of the pool away from the water. She was not my focus though, just a small background thing that I can remember. My focus was on who it's always on. My focus was on Girl A.  Girl A was making out with this well built guy. Well, not necessarily making out but they were kissing. So I feel like a mouse on the edge of the lawn waiting for the farmers tractor to pass over, and they stop.  She tells me to come over there so I do. I remember the guy kind of swimming off in the distance and I turned back and she was looking at me.  What is in a look? It's just eyes following whatever you want to see. The simple act of seeing. But this was different. She wasn't looking at me, she was looking into me. Like she could see beyond just me and into every inch of my heart. The kind of stare reserved for whatever being out there watches over us, something so deep it could fell a mountain on its glance alone. My heart beat picked up.  She was only a few feet away so as she moved closer it was immediately apparent to me. I swam there against the side of the pool, just keeping my position as she came closer. She was right in front of me now and she put her arms around my neck and pulled herself up to me. Then we kissed.  I can still feel the way her wet hair felt, slightly cold against the sides of my face. Her make-up slightly running because of the pool water. The smell of the chlorine and her skin. It seems so real that I could be there right now.  She let go and swam backwards a moment so we could see each other and she smiled. I don't know what expression I had, but I'm sure it was some combination of waiting for my heart to fall into pieces and yet winning the lottery at the same time. She told me to come with her and I did, she held my hand and led me around to the edge of the pool and we both climbed out. We walked to some chairs nearby and sat down next to each other. She put her head on my shoulder and I glanced back at her sister and she made a "you're finally there" face. I leaned back, and just hoped it wasn't a dream and that it would never end.  But it did end as all dreams eventually do. That moment, I think, is the first time I've ever truly felt that kind of absolute happy. All walls were brought down and it was raw. There were no other thoughts than right there, right then. Imagine, a four year race, ending in victory.  I could have never woke up tonight, but as long as that dream stayed in that moment it would have been fine by me.  I've been feeling like it's the way I look that turns her away. So I've been trying to get into better shape little by little, and it's a very slow process for someone who hasn't been in shape for 15 years, but it's coming along. She has motivated me all this time, but now, this dream helped even more. It showed me I can win without needing to change myself. Showed me that sometimes people can see the heart before they see the skin, and I wish everyone could.  I'm going to try even harder on getting into shape, because if I'm going to do this I'm going all out.  Gun's blazing.

      Well today is just...Starting off fan-fucking-tastic.  Couldn't sleep well again last night. Fell asleep around 3am, but was awake again by 5:15. Then I slept again from 6am till around 8:15am. So it wasn't terrible at this point. I don't mind getting up early, it's just nice to feel fully rested after the night is over, and I am not feeling that.  So I go out and talk to my parents for a bit, and complain about the kittens. One shits behind the lamp, then Bitty shits on the floor 10 inches from the litter-box. But it's still just a normal day so far.  That's when I got the call.  One of my best friends died today.  My CD Player.  I had my two new cds in, Muse's "Absolution", and The Still's "Logic Will Break Your Heart. About halfway through the 3rd song on the Stills cd, all hell broke loose. Suddenly my cd player made this noise like it was turned up to max volume and someone was holding a microphone to grinding gears.  I leap out of my chair, and turn the volume down. Well that did nothing, the sound didn't stop, nor did it get any quieter. So I hit power and stand there in shock as to what the hell is happening to my baby. Both my folks come in to find out wtf that noise was and I turn it back on to see if it had stopped. It had not. The sound was still just as ear splitting and I hit power again.  I turned it on tuner and turned the power on.  "GRAAAARAAAAAHA AHANNGARARAARARARARAAAAAHNAHAGAAR"  click  I switched to tape and turned the power on.  "GRAAAHAAGANAHAGAANANAARAGAHAANAGARAAHAHN"  click  Auxiliary had the same outcome.  Well at this point it's like a doctor told me I had cancer but wouldn't tell me how bad.  Is it dead? Is it just messing up right now? Maybe the sound will stop. Maybe its just a one time thing. Maybe..just Maybe, it will fix itself.  I waited a little while and my Dad came in again and asked me if it was still doing it. I said I didn't know so he turned it on again.  Oh my god.  It's working, IT'S WORKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Then it told me what the lyrics are to Apocalypse Please...  "Declare this an emergency Come on and spread the urgency And pull GRAAGAANANAGARAAGAHAANAHAGARAGAHANNHGRAGG"   Needless to say those Lyrics are COMPLETELY WRONG.  Now with no job, no money, I have to try and find a way to make due. My dad is going to help me, but I really doubt it's going to be 300 watt 60 disc changer.  I'll miss you my old friend.  May you.............May you be playing The Nixons in CD Heaven /cries and walks off

      Does anyone else get these emails?  They have to be my favorite spam-mail.  Dear Sir/Madam I am Micheal Harni A former government official of Liberia. Following the exit of president Charles Taylor of Liberia from power under a West African brokered peace agreement, led by Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo he was granted asylum by the Nigerian Government. In my position as the Financial Secretary to the President and close confidant, I left for Nigeria in his Entourage. My country has been engulfed in Protracted Civil war with rebels controlling some parts of the country. During the war, President Taylor disbursed large sums of Monies to buy the loyalty of the entire cabinet,and I can say with all modesty that I was one of the Chief Beneficiaries of this disbursement. This is aside from monies I used my official position to acquire while in office. Since we relocated to Calabar, Southern Nigeria all has been well, but with the recent indictment of former President Taylor by the war crime tribunal sitting in Sierra Leone and confirmed reports of a dedicated fund by the American Government to capture him in order to face war crime charges have now decided to leave the country. Presently I have funds totaling United State $15,000,000. (Fifteen Million US Dollars) Which I intend to move oversea for investment and spend the rest of my life there with my family. This transaction is risk-free as all local arrangement has been made.If you are prepared to assist to work with me I require the following:Your Full Name and Address, Your Private Telephone, Fax Number and private Email Address. As Compensation for your assistance you will retain 15% of the Total sum, While 5% will be mapped out for local and International expenses.Though we are not known to each other, I strongly believe that through this transaction we would be able to forge a mutually  beneficial relationship between us, now and in the future. Finally, the success of this transaction will depend to a great extent on mutual trust, secrecy and Confidentiality from you. I await your response by on my private  urlLink E-mail.mharni2002@yahoo.com  Best Regards, Micheal Harni.

      Fell asleep pretty fast at 3am or so. 5:30am roles around and I'm laying in my bed awake and my mind just won't shut the hell up. So I keep trying....  Nothing  Bitty comes in and jumps up on my bed.  "Hey Bitty" "MOWOWOWOWOWOWWOWOWOWOW" he says  so I pet him a little bit, he purrs louder than most cats meow. I lay back over and I hear him scratching at the wall trying to get inside my window blinds. This wouldn't be such a problem if he didn't force his way in and bend them back, and eventually break them off. So I pet him a little more, and go to lay back down, but he doesn't see I have one eye out and I'm just staring at him waiting for him to do it.  "scratch" "scratch" "scratch"  "BITTY!!!!"  this time I kinda move my foot towards him, not in a threatening manner, but in a "Not now" manner.  "MOWOWOWOWOWOW" is how he responds to me, but I can only imagine what kinda of names he was calling me in kitty-cat speak.  So now I'm awake. Guess I'll at least see Sportscenter Old School 4 or 5 times.

      Wasn't able to fall asleep last night till around 5am, but I didn't think I'd sill be in bed today at 5pm. It's not entirely my fault.....I admit, I was comfy, and since I don't have a job, I wasn't going to leave my bed while I was still comfy. How's that for a run on sentence?  Anyway, I woke up at 2pm and heard it was raining outside. We haven't had any real rain in over a month at this point. That's pretty common in east Texas during summer so when it does happen, it's a pleasant treat. I ended up sleeping till just after 4:30, and rolled over and turned on my TV. I usually turn my TV off on ESPN, simply because I watch it almost constantly, but it's wonderful when I wake up and the first thing I see is PTI.  Around the Horn + PTI = best sports hour (not a game being played) on television.

      If you've kept up with mine and  urlLink Korey's  blogs, we've been working on listing and trying to rank our favorite songs from different categories. We both have our kind of slower, most emotionally Linked songs, and we're still working on a few more lists.  Well I have my list of my top 20 favorite rocking songs pretty much done. This was originally gonna be called the heavy list, but really, my sense of heavy is not quite the same as his. Some of these are quite heavy, but some of them are more middle of the road. The seemingly lighter ones made the list for one of two reasons.  1. I've heard it sung live, and being there and feeling the emotion/power behind it will always make me knock my head around as I jam out to it. 2. It's just a song I've connected to and gets my blood really pumping and makes it hard for me to sit down, let alone sit still.  as for the second category, that means a lot of songs, but really these are the ones I'd have going if I was a wrestler and needed an entrance theme to pump me up.  so without further uhh-do  1.Comin Down - Dollybraid(RIP) - All The Hype that Money Can Buy 2. What it is to Burn -  urlLink Finch  - What it is to Burn 3. Suffocate -  urlLink Cold  - Year of the Spider 4. Breadfan -  urlLink Metallica  - Garage Inc 5. Aenema -  urlLink Tool  - Aenema 6. One -  urlLink Metallica  - And Justice for All 7. Tres Quatros -  urlLink Edgewater  - Lifter 8. Attention Please -  urlLink Caroline's Spine (sorta RIP) - Attention Please 9. Drugstore -  urlLink Stabbing Westward (RIP) - Darkest Days 10. Whatever -  urlLink Our Lady Peace  - Live 11. Congratulations -  urlLink The Juliana Theory  - Love 12. The Mission -  urlLink 30 Seconds to Mars  - ST 13. Pet -  urlLink A Perfect Circle  - Thirteenth Step 14. Fuck It -  urlLink Seether  - Disclaimer 15. Down Inside of You -  urlLink Fuel  - Natural Selection 16. My Friend of Misery -  urlLink Metallica  - The Black Album 17.  urlLink The Red  -  urlLink Chevelle  - Wonder What's Next 18. Sleep Now in the Fire - Rage Against the Machine(RIP) - Battle for Los Angeles 19. Collapse - Virgos(RIP) - The Path of Least Resistance 20. Three Evils (Embodied in Love and Shadow) -  urlLink Coheed and Cambria  - In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth 3  so there we go. For getting me pissed/pumped/excited look no further than these gems.  I miss Dollybraid so much

      Well, I didn't sleep the entire day away at least.  Woke up around 1pm because my brother was here. For those of you who don't know, he's a crackhead/drugdealer. He carries all the loving traits that make the world detest such people and when he shows up here, I find myself asking for one slip up and a lifetime of jail forced sex for him.  Is it still rape if he saw it coming?  Anyway, he was here about an hour, and will no doubt be back again tonight, to work on his broken down car he parked in our yard, or to wash his shirts for the third time today. I guess I should be grateful that he didn't bring his dirty whore wife, but that's not my style.  What is my style you ask? Well I'll tell you. I love shoes that normal white guys who are not confused about their culture, normally don't wear. I ordered some Friday, because the shoes I wear now are really not comfortable anymore. I also hate shoelaces. It's no that I have trouble tying them or anything. It's just I am much more happy being able to slip them on and go.  I have to say this pair is the first time I can remember, putting on shoes and them being comfortable. Usually it takes a good week for me to break some in well enough to where my wide feet stop feeling like they're stuck between 2 drunk fat guys at a park eating ribs all day that  urlLink Korey  made.  Some people just give until it hurts.  behold the  urlLink flashy foots's  and what's the best part of all? HALF PRICE. My dad taught me well, I am the cheapest person I know.

      "Even though my eyes are shut tightly May I see you brightly" - urlLink Sleeping at Last   Sleep  It's something so simple. Close your eyes, and then hours later you open them back up. Most of the time you can't even tell how much time has passed. All it is, is just what you do, inbetween days to make the next day easier.  Sleep  It hides an incredible power. The ability to rejuvenate your body, and your mind. The power to make you forget, but more importantly, the power to make you dream.  Dreams  This is where things get a little complicated. Dreams are more than just your mind working while you sleep. Dreams hold everything you've ever done. They are the bridge between the forgotten, and the cherished. Every night can be something different. One night you could dream about fighting robots with your dad, and the very next night you could be running faster than you could imagine through a crowd of people in a parade. Anything is possible. But nothing quite has the impact, of dreaming about your past.  Memories  This is the real power of dreaming. No matter why, or how, dreams will bring back anything you've known in the shut of an eye. Things you have forgotten. Things you have shut away because they hurt to much. People, places, sounds, and smells. Nothing is off limits. And it's too bad if you don't want to remember, because you don't have a choice.  whether it be something 20 years old, or something last week that has slipped your mind, eventually there's a good chance it will happen to you again when you sleep. The return of lost loved ones. Playing with a beloved pet one last time in the snow. Feeling your body shoot with electricity during your first kiss. Anything can be relived, no matter how afraid you are.  Sorrow  Just like any good moments in your life can be relived, so can the bad ones. The first time you brought home an F from school. The way it felt to feel a loved ones life slip away and nothing in your power could stop it. Knowing the person you've given your life and all of your heart to is gone. Living through these moments all over again can be dreadful. Once you awaken, the feelings don't go away. They can pin you down for weeks, or you can get lucky and lose them to memory after half a day. Whichever happens though......tears will fall..your breath will falter....and your heart will break all over again. And there's nothing you can do about it.  This ended up a lot longer than I expected.  I truly feel that loneliness is the worst emotion anyone can feel. I hope I don't remember my dreams tonight

      Well, I created my blog a little over 3 hours ago and now have my 4th post. Do these pants make my ass look fat?  Anyway....  So I'm wide awake and bored. Normally at this time of night I'm either asleep, or talking to either Korey or Sarah. I am talking to Korey, but since we're both bored, it doesn't really help a whole lot.  Sarah is in Tulsa right now. Her sister is about to start at ORU and since Sarah just graduated there with a BA, she's kind of leading the way for her sis. I spoke to her a little earlier and apparently it was a pretty hard day for her sister, but it's nothing Sarah hasn't gone through before.  Korey is working on his lists right now. I won the race by getting one of mine up first...No not that getting up, I mean my list. Now he's all under pressure cause he knows being the ass I am, I'm going to mention it in every post I write from now on. He's more focusing on his heavy list atm from what I can hear.  How is it 4:15am already? Would be great if I could stay up and stay awake all day, but every time I think I can pull that off, I'm unconscious mere hours after the sun rises. If I can make it to 9am, I can watch the back to back episodes of ER on TNT, but if I'm out before then my sleeping schedule is just boned.  If you look up here on our left you can see the first house that was ever used as a pig dress factory...........  I need some new cds. I have tons, and get several new just about every week, but I have music going pretty much 24 hours a day, and I go through all but the very best really fast. In the last couple weeks I've bought: Snow Patrol's "Final Straw" Pearl Jam's "Live at Benaroya Hall" Paul Durham "Ten Million Years" Finger Eleven's "Self Titled cd" Seether's "Disclaimer 2" The Format's "Interventions and Lullabies".  The only 2 of those that have lasted are the Snow Patrol and Paul Durham.

I feel your hand close beside me hear the highway, behind me all by ourselves, we made love under the sleeping moonless night all by ourselves, we will run, remember well it was...so long ago, remember baby well it was, a long time ago woooaaaahh  I couldn't stop you cryin or stop myself from fighting back I try but, never hard enough don't you remember love?  do you do you  all by myself I can see it like its right before my eyes all by myself, time goes by remember well it was, so long ago well it was, a long time ago remember baby...Well it was so long ago remember baby, do you, do you, remember babe"  All lyrics and music by Blacklab from their cd "Your Body Above Me"  Their Website  urlLink Black Lab   There used to be a post on the message board with the Time Ago video, but it's down now. Was a large file so I'm not surprised. I was hoping to link it here so maybe others could find it but oh well, least I saved it before it went down.  And that folks, is the greatest song ever written.

      So a  urlLink friend  and I have been bored the last week......Well.........Year or so really, but the last week we've been working on narrowing down our favorite songs. Well yesterday night I came to somewhat of a final version of my list of my top 20 most influential/moving songs of my life, and present them to you now...IN LIVING COLOR.  the list goes rank - song name - Band Name - Album Bands with RIP next to them are no longer together  1. Time Ago -  urlLink Black Lab  - "Your Body Above Me" 2. The Fall - The Nixons(RIP) - "The Nixons" 3.  urlLink Run  -  urlLink Snow Patrol  - "Final Straw" 4. Lightning Crashes -  urlLink Live  - "Throwing Copper" 5. Everlong -  urlLink Foo Fighters  - "The Colour and Shape" 6. Beautiful -  urlLink Flickerstick  - "Bringing Home the Astronauts" 7. Glycerine -  urlLink Bush  - "Sixteen Stone" 8. San Pedro - Dollybraid(RIP) - "All the Hype That Money Can Buy" 9. Sister - The Nixons(RIP) - "Foma" 10. Are you Sad -  urlLink Our Lady Peace  - "Spiritual Machines" 11. Breathing -  urlLink Lifehouse  - "No Name Face" 12. Chasing Daydreams - Shades Apart(RIP) - "Eyewitness" 13. Low Light -  urlLink Pearl Jam  - "Yield" 14. Last Christmas -  urlLink Jimmy Eat World  - "Last Christmas holiday vinyl" 15. Konstantine -  urlLink Something Corporate  - "Ready Set Go" 16. Jewel to Sparkle -  urlLink The Juliana Theory  - "Love" 17. Ten Million Years -  urlLink Black Lab  - "Your Body Above Me" 18. The Background -  urlLink Third Eye Blind  - "Third Eye Blind" 19. Comfort in Sound -  urlLink Feeder  - "Comfort in Sound" 20. Shimmer -  urlLink Fuel  - "Sunburn"  I love The Nixons, and I love Black Lab. no other bands have influenced my life as much as either of them. Listening to their cds can pretty much be a soundtrack to my life over the past 7 or so years. I have seen The Nixons/ urlLink Zac Maloy  (the lead singer of the band) 11 times in concert, and every single time it was like being born all over again. It's almost like getting my oil changed, every so often I get run down and need a good unwinding and theres nothing quite like hearing Sister Live to do that.   urlLink Run  from  urlLink Snow Patrol  is pretty new to me, I just got the cd about a week ago, but it just had this way of reaching into my chest and becoming part of me. The song makes me incredibly sad but in a good way and I haven't been able to break away from its hold.   urlLink My friend  and I are still working on 2 more lists. One is going to be a kind of, middle songs, ones that aren't very heavy, and they don't exactly grip us emotionally, but are just plain great in their own way. And also a list of the top 20 or so most adrenaline inducing rock songs in our own eyes. Don't expect much Yanni here....cept on my list....which will be all Yanni......  I'm really bored, I'll prolly post again before I go to sleep.

      Well, a friend of mine just recently started his own Blog on here and its giving him a good 13 minutes a day of non-boredom so I figured I'd give it a shot. I know absolutely nothing about html so this preset format will give me a chance to post my random crap thoughts up here for all to enjoy.  I told a friend of mine last night that I had started writing my thoughts down 2 days ago. Well needless to say I hadn't begun yet, but this will give me a way to cover my ass. She's always telling me how it helps her and how sometimes there are things that are just too much to tell other people at the time, but writing them down is a good way to get some relief. Well this is more like telling mass people at once(and by that I mean 3 people).  Gonna go toy around with settings and probably mess everything up so expect a new update from me on September 23, 2457.......But really it will just be tomorrow, only I have somehow completely destroyed the date system on my blog.
