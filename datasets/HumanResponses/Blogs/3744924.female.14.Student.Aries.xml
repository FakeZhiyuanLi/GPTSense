       urlLink    This is Kutless. They're this awesome Christian Hard rock kinda band that just started like 2 years ago,I think. I love them! The words to their songs are just amazing. I may see them at the beginning of August. Kindall,Sarah,Alana,Allison and me are all wanting to go and Kindall thinks she can get her dad to drive us. So...I'm stoked about that. Anybody who loves Christian music,buy their Sea of Faces cd. It's off the hook! Lol.&nbsp; urlLink

       Ok,I just had this absolutely horrible dream. I didn't think it would ever end!! It was about Josh(my boyfriend). He cheated on me! He went on this academic trip thing for some math competition and he made out with this smart chick in the back of the bus on the way home.Ugh...it was awful. I woke up crying and thrashing at my pillow...kinda funny,lol. Geez,my dreams sure have changed a lot lately. They used to be about my flute...or this guy I used to be absolutely in love with(Not Josh).But...he kind of screwed me into the ground. I'll spare you the details...but I'm his friend now even though sometimes I wish I could just start screaming at him(again...I already have many times).I thought we were like...soul mates or something. He made me feel so incredible.,but it was all fake I guess.He likes this other girl now. It's his ex-girlfriend. She's also a flute player,and she plays violin too. So,guess they're perfect for each other. They'll go off and get married and have kids and be happy....all because of what he did to me. Guess it didn't work out too bad for him....me on the other hand,I'll be alone for the rest of my life. That is,unless Josh communicates with me soon. I think he may be mad at me,but I'm not sure why. I hope not. He's my baby and I need him. If he's mad at me about something...well...I'll die. Anyway,I'll get off my soapbox here. I just thought I'd tell ya about my horrible dream. Peace!

      So,maybe we should see if I can keep this thing up for longer than a couple days. Lol...if I can,I think I deserve a party. Just like how I think I deserve a party because I can now do that stupid gaaauuul thing Sarah does with her tongue. I swear,I practiced that longer than I practiced my flute today. I so need to get a life. Anyone out there with any advice for a 14 year old girl,stuck on a farm,with only goats to ommunicate with give me a buzz...or something. Anyway,I tell ya more about me later...that is...if you want to know. Lol,I don't think you do,but it's fun freaking people out. Peace!!
