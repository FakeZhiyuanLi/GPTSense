         It's amazing how we all want this life a little  more everyday, it's crazy how we pick ourselves up just to let us down  anyway.&nbsp; The one thing that your missing is lounging on the log right next  to you."      &nbsp;    As I looked back on this stupid little "blogging"  experiment I realized that I enjoyed being able to look back to a few days  before and see how life had panned itself out for me.&nbsp; Things are  constantly unfolding and we never seem to take the time to look back to that  which has already been unfolded.      &nbsp;    4:15pm last friday afternoon, after having spent  the entire day running to Hobbs and then to BreHobbs and back to Hobbs again for  urlLink Whicker's . plants...I finally sat down in the office to listen to  urlLink 92.3 WTTS  to  try and win those illusive private  urlLink O.A.R.  tickets.&nbsp; I decided to call in and  see what else could be done to get my grubby little paws on them....the DJ  informed me that if I did not win to email him and he'd see if he could get my  name on the list --- yeah right.&nbsp; Long story short, I called in at 4:30  when I heard the "hey girl" intro and low and behold I won the damn  tickets!&nbsp; woohoo      &nbsp;    Now who to take?&nbsp; That would be a bigger pain  in the ass than I had figured!&nbsp; Skipping ahead to Saturday  morning.....while Chuckles, Greg, Kurt and I were busy being shrubbers my cell  rang.....Johnny Dub on the line.....he'd emailed the station and somehow managed  to get two more passes!&nbsp; Sweet...a weekend of 3 O.A.R concerts 1 sunday  evening, 1 Monday at noon (private show at the vogue) and 1 Monday night.&nbsp;  The boys of OAR were opening for some big name band "Matt Davidson or Dave  Matthewson...er something like that.&nbsp;       &nbsp;    The 2 shows at verizon definitely left a little to  be desired but the 45 minutes at the private show was AMAZING.&nbsp; The last  audio blog is from that show....my claim to fame is that I finally got to use  the line...."Marc, you're outta tune!"&nbsp; I'm prayin that someone recorded  the show and I'll post a link to the downloadable show.&nbsp; I'll be on  there!      &nbsp;    Jess and I went fishing over at the Nadin's little  cabin on lake Hart a week or two ago...this has got me wanting a place on a  lake.&nbsp; I called Lindsay Schaefer to find what the lake was called in Parke  County that we stayed at a summer ago.&nbsp; So now I'm looking for property on  Rocky Fork Lake and plan on going this Saturday to look at a couple of  properties.      &nbsp;    On the way up to Whicker's place, I saw an RV for  sale.&nbsp; I've been seriously considering the idea of buying it and taking off  across country.&nbsp; I started thinking about who I know that might be able to  go on an excursion with me.....Pickard, what are you doing for the next couple  of months???&nbsp; Are you in school yet??? When do you start???&nbsp; Would  Matty's cousin allow you not to pay rent for a few months while you are  gone?&nbsp; All I need to check into is to make sure that Satellite Cable  Internet would be feasible on an RV so that I can work from the road.&nbsp; Pic,  you want to go?      &nbsp;    Got a call from Nikki last night, telling me that  Theresa is now living in Indianapolis.&nbsp; I haven't touched the letter that I  wrote forever ago....but I guess I need to get it ready to send....Nikki is  going to call me back once she has her permanent address.&nbsp; I'm not so sure  that I can spill all my feelings on the blog like Weav, but maybe I'll  eventually get there.&nbsp; Forgiveness doesn't come easy.....but neither does  carrying the crushing weight of not forgiving....as everyone knows that knows  me......emotions and me just don't jive.&nbsp; Someday I'll figure out how to  handle these types of things.....we all have our weaknesses.      &nbsp;    Well, I probably ought to run...I've got 2 plans to  finish and a few Review Packets to send out before I can take the next week off  while I'm in Bean Town.&nbsp; Looking forward to more exciting journeys....I'll  try to keep this blog up-to-date.

                      I've spent countless hours trying to figure out  exactly how Markowitz, Sharpe, and others that I have since forgotten,  calculated the optimal diversification of assets in a portfolio so that the  nonsystematic risks associated with individual assets were eliminated with the  end result being the greatest return for the least amount of risk for a  specified investor's risk tolerance.      &nbsp;    I completely understand the basic theory, however  once I try to apply the actual numbers I get sooooo ticked because I can get  nowhere!&nbsp; Take smallcap stocks for example....based on historical returns  Ibbotson's shows that the average annual return for the 78 years from 1926 thru  2003 should be approximately 12.7%.&nbsp; I don't see how this is possible based  on the data.....how are they getting an average?&nbsp; mathematical average,  geometric average, compound interest (Internal Rate of  Return).....eeerrrrrgggg.      &nbsp;    I seriously need a mathematician&nbsp; to show me  how this is to be done!&nbsp; I WILL get this done eventually so that I can stop  having to use Frontier Analytics ----- a cryptic horrible program for asset  allocation, but hey at least they figured it out!      &nbsp;    Going "up north" tomorrow to get some clothes  because all of mine have somehow found their way to the dirty clothes  hamper...despite my trying to wear the dirties over and over.....cologning and  fabreezing, fabreezing and cologning.&nbsp; Finally even my sense of right and  wrong is upset and I know that wearing that pair of boxers with the elastic  showing through the wasteband and the flavor stripe down the rear has to  go.&nbsp; So I've decided that I need to decrease my laundry frequency and  increase my appearal choices.&nbsp; So to the Tommy outlet I go....with my  "hookups" i get nice button up for like $10 and shorts for $15...can't beat it  with a stick!      &nbsp;    Talked to Piehl tonight and I guess we are going  campin' for the 4th of July weekend.&nbsp; Should be quite a few of us  going...Karen's parents are letting us use their boat(s)....speedboat and  possibly the pontoon!&nbsp; So the suburban and the dually may be pulling a  boat....how am I going to pull my trailer?&nbsp; (bring the S-10 out of  retirement....yeah right!)      &nbsp;    Jessica sent off her pics to Lane Bryant Monday  morning......I am so hoping that she does well.....good luck Jess....you deserve  it!&nbsp; I've got confidence in ya!      &nbsp;    Johnny had me run a few estimates for some  "shrubberies" today for his company.&nbsp; I think he's been running some mad  game up there with the other "northsiders".....hey bro....do what you gotta do  ---- enjoy yourself and have a good time and learn from your mistakes -----  that's all I can tell ya.      &nbsp;    I found out that Bradly is now living in Evansville  and working six days a week...he may come up for the camping trip.&nbsp; I miss  him and hope he can make it.&nbsp; NOTE TO BRAD ----- I might be able to come up  with some Sterling to get you up here.      &nbsp;    I told Gerber that we'd definitely road trip it  over to catch the Jack Johnsion show......I've only heard one live show...but  good stuff nonetheless.&nbsp; I probably ought to download some more of his  stuff.&nbsp; I love artists who share their stuff for free on the  internet.....live music is so much better than the studio recorded stuff.&nbsp;  Check out this site full of concert sharing  bands.....http://www.archive.org/audio/etreelisting-browse.php      &nbsp;    some of my favs are O.A.R., Jack Johnson, Donovan  Frankenreiter, Robert Randolf and the Family Band....thanks to Danny B. for  introducing me to O.A.R. nearly 4 years ago now.&nbsp; Danny B, should you ever  stumble onto this site....I miss you bro and hope to hook up at a homecoming at  the house in the future.      &nbsp;    Well I reckon I've blogged enough for tonight.

                      annual review notifications, postcards, and surveys  have all been sent for the month of June.&nbsp; Mick is currently running about  5 weeks behind so scheduling has been fun to say the least.      &nbsp;    I've got the ball rolling again with my CFP studies  after a long break.      &nbsp;    Confirmation #HL63GW
