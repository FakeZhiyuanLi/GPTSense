      I wish to diverge from my initial blog-plan for a moment to riff on the topic of sometimes boyfriends.  This is a topic I know a great deal about.  So you know that "friend" of mine in the last post?  Well, in reality, he is actually what I like to call my "sometimes boyfriend".  Basically, this means that we have a rocky relationship that consists of discussions every other week or so regarding the "state of our union" after which we either fight, argue, or break up.  After this unhappy period is over (anywhere from an hour to three days) we get back together and do the same thing all over again, finally deciding that maybe (it would be for the best) if we just had an open relationship.  And then we attempt to do this open relationship thing and be chill and less intense or whatever (even though this is pretty much totally the opposite of the way the relationships started out) and that's when the "sometimes boyfriend" thing starts swinging into full effect and he really becomes the "sometimes boyfriend" who you see "occasionally" and who may or may not call you when he returns from Turkey after hanging out with a really hot Dutch girl.  Sometimes boyfriends (once the "sometimes" swings into full effect and there is less of the rocky fighting bit) sound great in theory but let me tell you, they suck.  Sure, on the plus side there is no committment, sex when you need it but not when you don't.   And yes, in theory, with a sometimes boyfriend, you can be young, single, hot, hook up with other hotties, etc, but also have some stability; a nice guy you trust to fall back on.  But that is theory and theory is flawed. (And this is not just because those guys who you once thought were hotties and who you are now available to hook up with are in actuality just immature losers who put Tigi Bed-head in their greasy hipster hair and play the guitar for some half-assed band that begins with the word "The"). No, sometimes boyfriends suck because sometimes boyfriends are usually just confused messes who are using this sometimes relationship to take their confused mess out on you.    You see, from my experience, men have this Madonna/whore complex (and this isn't just lame grad school talk -- it is totally for real.)  They have to divide "sex" from "girlfriend" and when it starts getting all confused in the sometimes relationship (that they usually ask for) they lose the ability to communicate in any functional way.  In fact, they begin to resemble strange alien animals akin to those I've never seen in Australia.  They begin to make lots of bizarre yelping noises that they name "state of the union" discussions and keep making these noises over and over and over again so that you feel really really tired and worn out and start to think less clearly about everything in life just like them.  And because you are really really tired and worn out and thinking less clearly about life just like them, you act stupidly and stay with the sometimes boyfriend because you think you love him.  And even when your friends say that maybe you should lose the sometimes boyfriend, you stand by him (sometimes) like a big old idiot, convinced that "sometimes" will change back to just boyfriend even though it never will.  Yep, so after some thoughtful reflection, I've decided to lose the sometimes and just not deal for a while.   (Click on the title to see my 'sometimes boyfriend'.)

      Almost a year ago, my friend and I were brainstorming late at night and came up with an idea for a webzine. It was in retaliation to all the irony-laden, hipster, magazines, that were the rage in our occasionally irritating neighborhood of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Our webzine (which we would call Juicebreak) would be the anti-Vice, embracing all that was thoughtful, passionate, interesting, and most importantly, sincere. We wanted to publish the kinds of articles that we and our friends would want to read: articles that spoke to people passionate about culture in a geeky not-always-so-hip kind of way.  My friend and I detailed the "look" of the zine and decided that it would be modeled after a Kindergarten class. (And I have to give credit where credit is due here -- this format thing was entirely his idea).  It would be broken up into sections: Language Arts, History, Nap Time, Art n' Crafts, Music, Science, etc.  And on a page that was designed to look like that lined yellow paper that we used to write on when we were kids, we would write things like:    Today we talked to talked to Joe (hyper-link) about Art. We also talked to Ellen (hyperlink) about Books and Mike (hyper-link) about Astronomy.   The idea was that it would be super-simple and the hyperlinks would take you to articles, interviews, pictures, and music.  We would even do some audio interviews.   But, alas, like so many big ideas that I get, this one puttered out despite our purchase of the domain name. There was no way I was going to be able to teach myself Java or HTML between grad school and working part-time and there was certainly no way my friend would teach himself any of these things either.  (He's a busy chap and usually has his very independent career interests in mind).  Yes, like my SciFi TV pilot idea, like my restaurant idea, like my revival movie theater idea (which, really, we could do super-cheap!), like my novel(s)...this too never happened.    So I dedicate this blog to juicebreak and all my other big ideas that never went anywhere...And yeah, I'm sure you assholes who stumble upon this will steal some of these flashes of momentary brilliance but just remember, I thought of it first.

      I'm turning twenty-five in about twelve days.  Evidently, this is not just a crisis year for me but for most females in New York.  To make matters worse, my mom has left some anti-aging cream for me with my sister.  I'm supposed to pick it up from my sister's doorman.  She lives in a fancy high rise in Chelsea.  My sister, K, said to me, after leaving the anti-wrinkle cream with the doorman, "Isn't that convenient?  Aren't doorman buildings great?"  My sister has this weird thing where she thinks everyone needs to live like her even when they can't afford it or can afford it but know better: for example, have weekly colonics, get $200 haircuts uptown in Julianne Moore's hairdresser's private studio, buy "really affordable" $145 pants, and live in a high rise in Chelsea that is basically the equivalent of the Ritz.  Oh yes, and spend weekends perusing for furniture with her model-turned-broker husband at ABC Carpet.  Now, perhaps if I too looked like a movie star, got a job that paid me at least 60 K (she just resigned as a glorified secretary for some rich dude in finance), and was thirty-one and married, this might be appropriate but seeing that I can barely even get interviews for jobs, do most of my shopping at Daffy's, and just broke up with my broke actor boyfriend, this doesn't really work out so neatly.  Yeah, I'm thinking: share in Brooklyn, maybe saving up to buy a bike, feeling out some dating.  That's more my speed.  But, according to my mom, dad, and sister, I can't do this since I'm "an adult now." Hmmm.  Since when was twenty-five OLD?  I guess since the Olsen twins took over the world.  Yeah, my family really needs to get a grip.  I mean, when I told my mom today that I left the job I was laid off from on my resume, she said:  "Do you really think that's a good idea?  Because when I hire a cleaning lady and hear that they were laid off..."    You get the picture.    (Also, don't you love how they bold CORRESPONDENT in the link.  So thoughtful of them).

      So capitalism is totally getting me down.  I've started hunting for jobs again "like a truffle snouting pig."  This "truffle snouting pig" bit is not mine -- don't worry.  I'm quoting a terrible line here from a cookbook manuscript advising woman on how to get a "Fire Island gay man's bod" that I had to read for one of these lame treat-your-assistant-like- crap-and-pile-their-desk-with-tons-of-work-jobs that paralegals do for double the money.  Yep.  A job I was incidentally offered, only to, um, not really be offered?   But back to the topic on hand: capitalism.   I'm sick of capitalism.   I'm sick of negotiating everything from jobs (okay, acceptable) to boyfriends (less acceptable) to whether or not my roommate is going to take out the trash.  I mean I get that we just have to accept capitalism -- that life is, at least in the United States, basically business -- but come on?  When people start scheduling appointments for their friends and start becoming so freakin' selfish and opportunistic that they can't even help a pal move a little crap to their sublet, what's the deal-yo?  I suppose the rationale is that we are stuck here so we may as well live it up: keep shopping around for the next best thing, keep up with the bargain-hunting, and live up the fact that the one good thing about America is that, yes, even though we are chained to the making of money, we can ultimately all be "individuals".  We can buy our freedom.  We have the option of becoming totally self-sufficient.  Yep, we can buy our own lifestyles and not be chained to anyone but ourselves.  And the man.  Oh, but that doesn't count.  Oh, and wait, only some of us have that option.  Huh?  Yeah, so my point is, professionalism is for the office.  Leave it at my apartment door please.

      Joanna Newsom is good (perfect Sunday afternoon music). Click on the title to see her website.  I guess she opened for Will Oldham and Devandra Banhart.  Oops.  Must have missed that (among other things) when I had been locked up in my apartment writing my thesis for the last four months.  Also, because I am currently in a transition period, I have not had any brilliant big ideas.  This is sad but also somewhat stabilizing...Although, I did have a reflicker of my independent publishing house idea the other day. (When I explained this several weeks ago to a realist acquaintance of mine in a spazzy flurry, he said, looking at me point-blank and serious, "But you need money for that, JB").  Uh, Duh.    Anyhow, the house would publish scifi, romance novels (but w/a more 70's inspired edginess), and young adult.  Trashy stuff that most people I know really want to read but pretend they don't. Why the reflicker?  Because (gloat time here) I had an interview for an editorial assistant position with a certain very important editor (think last name fish) whose name I accidentally misspelled in my thank you letter (I incidentally was not offered the position -- surprise, surprise) and the delusional wheels started-a-turning.  Editor in three years!  Start the Grove Press of our generation!  Meet Daniel Pinchbeck (actually I don't even know what Mr. Pinchbeck looks like) who finds me fascinating after I tell him my alien story.  Run away to land of shamans and watch him eat Ahyuasca. Become a shaman healer and single-handedly save our world that is currently going to hell in a hand basket. Resurrect love, truth, magic and transmorph those lovely "Swans" back to their even lovelier pre-plastic surgery selves.  Ahh, so am I the Walter Mitty of our generation or what?  Spielberg should make a goddamn movie about me.  Also, I think my blog design is ugly.  Note to myself: I seem to have problems picking adequate places to live and blog designs during transitional periods.

      Usually I have problems with Michael Moore.  Despite some very good things that he does and has done, I tend to think that his films veer into propaganda.  (You should have heard me bitch after I saw him speak at the Nader rally -- don't ask -- years back.  Although at the time I was totally confused about my political sentiments and still clinging to my dad's Republican/Libertarian values).  Anyhow, I felt much of the same about Farenheit 9/11 except that ultimately it ended up effecting me pretty deeply -- mostly due to the war footage which we have not been seeing on the news in the US which is totally insane and pretty much moved me to tears.  I mean, if people saw that stuff, there would be so much more backlash against the war.      However, because whenever an argument is crammed down my throat too harshly my first reaction is to take the opposite side, I couldn't help but start to look at things pragmatically and in terms of American interests as I watched Moore's film.  I thought, well, yes, of course it makes sense that we have to protect our interests, Saudi investments, OIL (after all we are really running out).  Yes, of course it makes sense that any "smart" president would court those people who can help us achieve that.  Yes, of course it makes sense that we would want to "clean out" the Middle East in order to protect American interests, etc.   In fact, I even started to think in my head that yes, of course, this all makes so much sense that the Bush administration couldn't possibly be the "evil" monster that Moore and others make it out to be.  Rather, they probably just honestly believed that this was the only way to protect America -- after all without our economy, what the hell are we?    Don't get me wrong, in reality, I think the war was clearly wrong, that Bush has done irreperable damage to our country and the world, that this administration is a prime/pivotal example of the problem with politics merging with business in America, and that the death of Iraqi's and our soldiers is devastating.  However, what I do mean is that I can see how someone might rationalize this behavior (and mistakingly think it is the right thing to do) despite how messed up it might be and I can also see how this same someone might cling to this rationale even more tightly after viewing Moore's film.  (I mean, really, that whole pointing fingers bit at Bush when he was sitting in that Florida classroom when the towers were hit was not helping anyone who might think like this as even I, an anti-Busher, felt sorry for him at that exact moment).  Oh yeah, and the "fake" fear of terrorism angle that Moore was pushing is clearly false.  I mean, come on.  Terrorism is and will increasingly be a very real threat according to the evidence of very smart people like Manuel Castells.   Oh yeah -- and I was recruited three times by the army.  Somehow they got my cell number and called me about three months after 9/11.  They made the army sound quite cozy: travel, education, etc.  A week after that, I got another call.  A couple of months after that, another...

      Today, I walked out of a movie.  That makes the second in a week.  The first was Harry Potter -- not a big surprise.  I mean, it wasn't like I was into the whole thing anyhow. The series always seemed like a cheap hodge-podge of better and more imaginative children's books and films: Roald Dahl, Narnia, Madeline L'Engle, The Worst Witch, my own series (that I wrote when I was ten) about Stacy the Good Witch..etc, etc.  And the whole Quidditch, just get a super-fancy 2500 broom and you can excel at the sport always kind of grossed me out too.  (I mean what are we teaching our kids, really?)  Anyhow, it wasn't even that this particular Harry Potter sucked any harder than the others -- actually, the point of view was kind of interesting, and it seemed sort of smartly made (thanks Y Tu Mama director) -- it was just boring because the series is boring and we've seen it all before.  Plus, I think it is more of a winter holiday kind of film of something.  Today, however, I walked out of The Day After Tomorrow.  Now, this was a surprise.  This is my kind of movie: apocalypse films usually rock my world.  And at first I (mistakingly) thought it might.  It seemed super B with all the right stupid shots: cu of computer screen with bizarre inexplicable weather patterns, cut to shocked and awed faces of multi-ethnic researchers, crappy "technical" dialogue that looks like it was spruced up with a thesaurus, comradery between city-goers in hell a la Ghostbusters.   Except...except...I didn't give a crap about any of these people and the over-blown special effects just bored me to tears.  Who cares about Dennis Quaid or his too-smart-for-school son when there was never anything developed between them and when everyone is else in the world is dying too?  Okay, I do have to say that Jake did a decent job.  (Side note here: oddly enough, while watching this movie, I had a flashback to flying with the actual Jake years ago  -- I was in the seat next to him and he was listening to No Doubt on his headphones and talking about movies or something and how hot Gwen Stefani was -- which added a texture of the surreal to my movie-going experience...)  Anyhow, enough of the gross name-dropping which I will say upfront, I have a problem with...the film was so freakin' formulaic it made me really really sad.  I started to think fondly of that eccentric mess, "Dreamcatcher".  At least it had some heart or something.  Yeah...watching this movie made me realize that movies are just getting worse and worse. (Although I do have to say that every once in a while an anomaly slides through the back door ).  In general though, technicality and special effects are prized over substance, dialogue seems to be written by stunted fifteen year olds whose dads called in favors, and the filmmakers no longer even seem to be condescending to the audience but, in many cases, appear actually lower than the audience.  Okay, and I'm just going to dig my claws in even deeper and say that I think that Mean Girls -- which everyone seemed to love -- also sucked.  It was certainly no Heathers or even Clueless like the stupid reviews said.  Come on: the film had no freakin' style and it was cliche.  At least Heathers had that dark slightly schizoid moodiness and Clueless had that bubblegum cheesy LA look which was kind of brilliant.  (And it totally predecessed that whole Legally Blonde phenomenon).   Mean Girls just looked generic.  On a bright note, I saw the Cellular trailer.  I'm psyched.  The movie looks so retarded that it has to be semi-good.  Also, I realize that I am not at all adhering to my blog theme.  In fact, while spacing out mid-way through boring The Day After Tomorrow, I thought of changing my blog's name to  "Death and Life on the L" which was actually this column I had an idea for a year ago (named after the Jane Jacobs book) and sent to some guy that a friend knew at a the L magazine.  Anyhow, I guess that probably is not the best idea since the guy never emailed me back...I also thought of changing it to "I'm in Hell" (kindly suggested to me by another friend) but oh well.  I'm a scattered person.  Such it is when you have big impractical fairly irrational ideas and stuff.  Trailer viewing tip:  I recommend replaying the segment where William H. Macy says, "She was dirty, Jack," over and over again as well as the part where Chris Evans freaks out about the charger...

      So there is this look that I advise you not to touch. I like to call it the MTV Aging Diesel hipster look.  You know what I'm talking about.  These are the kind of people who almost look all L-trained out except that they wear really clean American Apparel tee-shirts and the prerequisite expensive faded Diesel jeans.  This is a look that may have worked for them when they were twenty-one/twenty-two but looks drab/sad/dated when they are twenty-six/twenty-seven.  (They also look like -- even though they know better -- they might still have their trucker hat hanging around).  The female aging MTV Diesel hipsters also favor those awful pleated short skirts they sell at Urban Outfitters that are popular with the fourteen year old Jersey set (I call these skirts finger-me skirts because that is basically what they are asking any man to do) except instead of pairing it with a tank top, flip flops, and a precious shoulder bag, they pair it with a mullet, bangs, or 80's inspired earrings.  The first time this cultural stereotype really fell into place for me was when I encountered one such MTV  Aging Diesel hipster at a bar a couple of weeks ago.  The guy was wearing this tattered tennis wrist-band thing, a suit blazer, and the prerequisite Diesel jeans.  He also looked like he was wearing make-up: concealer or matte powder or something.  Anyhow, he was a disaster.  I almost wanted to give him a makeover right there in that dirty East Village bar but then I decided, what's the use?  Aging MTV Diesel hipsters, as disastrous as they look, tend to do well with the rich LA film crowd.  I mean, this guy claimed to be hobnobbing with all the right kids.  Quite the schmoozer in his matte Cover Girl make-up, he had a screenplay agent and everything.   Yeah, so I guess that maybe this is a good look if you want to be successful in film in New York.  Otherwise, do us all a favor, and avoid it like Eve Ensler.  Also -- in my last post which I just deleted I wrote that I hated my dad.  I don't hate my dad.  I love my dad.  What I do hate, however, is looking for apartments.  It is so stressful.  My dad rocks.

      Isn't this article so sad?  The real Carrie (who lately my friends have been not-so-jokingly calling me) has managed to delude herself beyond delusion.  Poor dear.  Whatever happened to aspirations of making her own billion?  (Although, I must say, I suppose it is tough when even in pc/progressive NYC, my friend's boss tells her at a meeting that he wished she would give her presentation in a nurse's uniform).  But even if aspirations of making one's own billion seem a little steep then what  happened to calling a dick ex-boyfriend a dick ex-boyfriend?  Even thirteen year old girls know how to do that.  Come on Candace, I dare you to say it.  (Trust me -- it will screw with Mr. Big's head more than it will burn bridges).  And I also dare you to admit that you want to get married one day.  Really, it is pretty much inevitable -- us women are just wired that way.  Stop fighting chemistry.  (Is she a total future plastic surgery victim or what?)  One thing I do have to compliment Ms. Bushnell on, however, are her statements regarding social behavior in New York.  However, unlike Candace, I happen to believe that everyone wants that one person in their life who does call them back "the next day" and if they say "nay" then they are just deluding themselves.  (And if you read through her lines, you can see that it is clear that she, most of all, wants that "next day" call).    Poor, lonely, Candace.  Gen X/Y is so much more evolved than she and the ladies of her generation will ever be.

      Okay, so I was at my friend Katharine's apartment, skimming through "The Orchid Thief" by the lovely and talented Susan Orlean when more on the August Sanders idea came to me.  What if, rather than an art installation project, I could do a book.  Like Susan, I could write detailed impressions of various subjects who I would interview, accompanied with photographs.  I ran this by Katharine (explaining August Sanders, etc)  Katharine already knew about August Sanders, however, and emerged with a giant cofee table book of his work.  (A photographer herself, apparently she has been really into him for some time).  Then I had an idea for the project to be even bigger: involving more people.  Katharine could do photo, etc, I could do the written version, maybe some digital video, someone else could do audio, and another set design type person could make models of houses, food, etc...And then I had another idea.  Since networks are kind of interesting (and hip now) what if we somehow did a map/connection of all of these various social/cultural types --- somehow mapped out what their daily route looked like, where they ate, worked, stopped, etc -- and could offer a map showing what an average street in NYC would look like.  Indeed, though, all this is expensive and would require a grant but this could be an amazing project.  Especially if there were a lot of people involved...hmmm.  Or maybe I could just start with the book myself and go from there...  Wait, and now I'm remembering this great video I saw at this experimental film festival in Brooklyn...it was an anonymous submit.  Basically, an older couple gave a tour of their house.  It was filmed in maybe the 60's.  This is a great gimmick and paired with the August Sanders social type thing, totally revealing and great...each social type could give a mundane tour of their house on camera...especially since lifestyles are so particularly a 21st Century/NYC concept.  (Well maybe I'm overstating that, but I think this would be good...)  So the question is, how to get subjects...could just start out with my friends and go from there, I guess.  Would take all of an hour...weekends.  Hmmm, gotta get my future roomie Emily James back...she'd be totally down.

      I am concerned that I write Assistant Lit.  Oh well.  So I won't write the great American novel.  At least The Devil Wears Prada made loads of money.    A cabby looked at me today (limping, tired, post-moving, etc -- sheesh can I make myself sound any more pathetic? Actually, at this point, it has kind of reached the point of fun) and laughed.  "This crazy New York life," he said.  But then he smiled, "Don't worry -- I really believe good things come to good people."   And yes, one thing is for certain, I do know for a fact that I am a GOOD PERSON.   And when the fuck did my life become a goddamn Sex and The City episode anyway?  I think what we have here is an excellent example of Baudrillard's simulacrum.  (Which by the way, was stolen from low-brow mastermind king, Philip K. Dick, so there).  Also, I need a vacation.  I'm going to go to the beach and wear an overpriced bikini.  (I look pretty good in a bikini -- for real).  This is my new plan...  So yeah, I guess this stupid blog has become more a glorified journal then anything else.  Oh well.  Let's discuss my low-brow-ed-ness again, shall we?  (Indeed, my thesis advisor did ask me several months ago if I had ever read Valley of the Dolls.)  Well, at least I'm not writing that really spare over-MFA-programmed shit that takes life so goddamn quietly -- you know the kind of novels that they make into prestige film pieces starring Kim Basinger and Ryan Gosling? -- and at least I'm not writing some crappy gimmicky New York novel that actually tries to take itself seriously which will be utterly forgettable in five years.  Can we say Tama Janowitz?  Okay, I'm doing us all a favor now and lightening (and shutting) the hell up.

      So why'd you try to fuck him like a bitch? -Jules Winnfield, Pulp Fiction  So is there something all you wise men (and maybe women to) know that I don't?  That if you are a nice, fairly intelligent, attractive, woman, you were basically put on this earth to be tortured, tested, and 'fucked'?  Is this what Lars Von Trier is telling us in his movies and Hitchcock too?  Is this just some obvious lesson that everyone else has learned except for me?  Is this just a fact of life?    Okay, maybe I'm being dramatic or something but its my birthday so give a girl a break.  Also, how good is Kellis?

      So, last night was my birthday celebration.  Today is my actual birthday.  Besides getting embarrassingly wasted (it has been a long month, I tell you) I somehow managed to fall down stairs and sprain my ankle (after drunk-dialing four of my friends who were no-shows).  So now on my real birthday, I am a) bedridden and immobile (concerned that I may have to go to the hospital) and b) disappointed with humanity overall.  (This happens quite a lot and it never ceases to remind me that you can't count on anyone but yourself).  I feel like this must be -- in particular -- my life lesson or something because it has been drilled in my head something like fifty gazillion times now or something.  Yes, so I have decided that I am going to become a hermit these next couple of months.  I will devote my time to my art, healing my heart, and fuck the rest o' them.  ('Cept the really awesome people who did show up for my birthday party or rsvp-ed to say they couldn't make it who I really love).  Also, I now have a shit-list.  I need to write this down as I will most likely forget and become a softee when I see these people again.  But no!  I must remain strong!   1) M  (big time on the list and after last night...) 2) M 3) K  These people are just no good.  Well, I'll be objective and say that maybe it isn't that they are no good but that they just aren't for me.

      Yes, it is true.  I finally picked up my anti-wrinkle cream from my sister's doorman and have recently become obsessed with my skin regimen.  In fact, today, after seeing The Five Obstructions at the Film Forum -- reminding me that once again Lars Von Trier is the Hitchcock of our generation except whereas Hitchcock tortured his mostly female protagonists in the name of entertainment, Trier does it to boringly and didactic-ly prove a point -- I decided that I needed to add Toner to my four-skin-cleansing process to prevent further outbreak on my forehead (which coincidentally sprouted up after I began using my mother's Murad moisturizer).  Yes, so now Bliss's Combination Skin Toner is in my beauty tote.  (Uh, I mean my dirty old el cheap-o shoulder bag).   I hope this will ward off further ma'am's being elicited in my direction from grocers, bartenders, storekeepers, doormen, and young children's mouths across Brooklyn and Manhattan -- that and rooting out my old concert tee-shirts from my duffel bag once I move into my new sublet.  Oh, and I willingly admit that I am a walking liberal hypocrite.  I refused to give my zip code to the lady at Sephora even after she kindly explained to me that it is "just so they know where to open their next store."  Also, check out the trailer for The Corporation which opens tomorrow.   http://www.thecorporation.tv/trailer And Bob, I'm looking at you when I say that.  (Research)

      New idea: ding, ding, ding!  I went and saw the August Sander: People of the Twentieth Century A Photographic Portrait of Germany at the Met.  He took pictures of people of every profession in Berlin in a kind of ethnography/art experiment.   (Pretty cool if you haven't seen it).  Anyhow, this got my brain churning and I have a new big idea.  What if -- and I have a feeling this must have been done by someone already as it really doesn't seem that original -- I were to do this same thing for Manhattan/Brooklyn but for the Twenty-First Century and multimedia.  I mean: interviews with people, video footage, even odor...(the underappreciated sense).  Maybe I could make giant dioramas somehow using photographic blow-ups of peoples' apartments and duplicate their exact scent or something.  (The lawyer's house smelled this way, the auto insurance salesman's...)  Okay maybe not giant dioramas but small odor samples placed besides the photograph and interviews.  (Yeah, now I'm thinking that I should go with the whole pseudo-scientific thing as much as possible as it would both work w/Sander's meticulous study as well as comment on today's America). Taste too: replicate their dinner...Yeah, so the idea is a complete multi-media, sensory, duplication of a lifestyle/social type.  More on this idea later...

      Yesterday I went to the frying pan out on Chelsea Piers with my cousin and her friends. She is Korean and moving back home in a couple of days because her visa just ran out.  She's one of those cute creative East Village/Williamsburg Asian girls who rides around on her bike with her smart little haircut and fun dresses.  When I went over to her apartment, she played her tabla for me and showed me some of the animation stuff she has been working on.  (She studied animation at SVA and was doing that for a year after school).  Anyhow, we got to talking, and I realized that when she gets back home she probably will have to fight with her parents about an arranged marriage.  (Basically all of my relatives in Korea have had arranged marriages except for my black sheep mother and one of my crazy super-duper artsy cousins who went to RISD).  This makes me so sad as she has this great Japanese boyfriend who lives up in Harlem and loves her life in New York.  I kept imagining her in Korea, married to some boring guy who is a friend of a friend of her parents, eating very little (because everyone there is obsessed with being super skinny), and wearing one of those conservative suits they always made her wear when she was younger.  Poor Fay!  So I talked to this guy who knows my friend Sulai, and jokingly asked him if he would marry her.  He said yes -- (well after he asked me if she was hot and was financially independent).  But anyhow, she's going back and dealing.  Got to respect her for that.  Anyhow, the whole incident made me feel like such an asshole for bitching about my parents.  I mean, my mom is pretty crazy but she's awesome.  After all, she gave her strict parents the finger and moved to NYC when she was twenty-four and married my dad.  And she dealt with our asshole wasp Stepford Wives town for over twenty-five years where people constantly asked me questions ranging from the hilarious -- Does you mom use Pearl Cream? -- to the ridiculous -- Is your mom Connie Chung?-- to the flat out racist -- Your mom can drive???  (Well, as a result, she's sort of adopted a Wasp mentality but still...)   Yeah, so my point is that I really want Fay to come back.  My new mission/big idea is to get her back in the city somehow so we can make cool movies together.  (And so I can give her back her bike too, of course).

      I awoke today to my alarm playing NPR and felt for the first time, in a while, like an adult. I don't know whether it was the apathy (or perhaps it was more like quiet powerlessness) towards the news or the distracted manner at which I glanced through Paul Krugman's "The Great Unraveling" while drinking my mug of coffee (kind of a pompous guy -- imagined him a business suit acting arrogantly toward the average journalist without the MBA), or the fact that I'm living alone for the first time...who knows. All I know was that I felt adult and like I had finally got -- this would be that "aha" moment my fifth grade english teacher always talked about -- what all those parents, my parents, must feel each and every day of their lives...Anyhow, it really wasn't all that bad.  As I locked my door, contemplating my newly found adult-ness my mind drifted towards the movie "Before Sunset" which I saw a couple of days ago...How as you grow up flirtation transcends intensity,people start taking their lives less seriously, and after a while you just start to do your own thing and that is good enough.

      So now that I'm a card-carrying democrat, I can openly admit it.  I LOVE corporate America.  Today, clutching my binder of company benefits, snagging a nice soy latte from Starbucks, signing in an hour early to work (I get paid overtime!), handing my envelopes to mail to the nice mail-lady, I realized, this is what life is all about -- well, kind of: getting rewarded for doing a good job, hard work, and discounted gym memberships.  So yeah, I will say it again.  I LOVE corporate America.  They treat ya well.

      The Situationists believed that life should equal art.&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;sort of. I'm over-simplifying here and I'm sure some pompous academic geek who lives for this stuff will mock me when he reads this.&nbsp; But&nbsp;whatev.&nbsp; Anyhow, this one project they had was called "psychogeography."&nbsp; Guy Debord and his buddies would wander the streets (the point was to waste time and money, both vital to capitalism) and create a path that one could never read.&nbsp; The point was that the path was there -- it existed -- just like your life but like your life it was not recorded.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Debord didn't realize that when he and Jurgen-something-or-other made these "psychogeographic maps" which they put on display in museums that recorded their subjective wanderings through Paris, they were kind of sabotaging their theory.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Like all famous dudes (Salvatore Dali for example) publicity starts to become more important than staying true to oneself.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, Debord was a guy who met girls by lying in Parisian gutters during rain-storms.&nbsp; (They would walk by and sympathetically ask the wet but dapperly dressed&nbsp;young  man "are you okay?"and he would look up, grab their hand, look deep into their eyes, and say "yes, now that I've met you!")&nbsp;&nbsp; Then they would grab an expresso or something and share a Gualoise. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      I am overly industrious.  I work, work, work.  Because I am so grateful...  Everyone else needs a breather but no, not I, of the too many questions and too much time.  I work to free my brain, you see.  If it isn't occupied, I fly into my head and there are just too many not-so-good places I drift too.  So, I work, work, work.  At least there will be a reward.

      How's this for a catchy intro letter:  "I am seeking representation through you and your agency, blank.  I write gay horror."   Um, gay horror?  Love to see what this queen looks like.  Or this:  "What still bothers me is the fact that, during the surreal week in July, I actually did try to murder my own sister.  More than once, to tell the truth."  Catchy but...uh, KIND OF PSYCHO. Sure, let's take a potential serial killer on as a client.  Whoo-hoo.

      Why is it that even when I tell myself to act nicely towards my parents -- reassure myself that despite our differences that I love them -- I still end up acting like an ungrateful twit?  And why is it that whenever it is I need to prove something to people (in the case of my parents, that I am not disorganized or irresponsible) I always end up acting the opposite in front of them?  (Try leaving my wallet by the pool for four hours unattended.)  I don't understand my behavior at all.  Oh well.  No one does, I guess.  Also, relaxing out in front by the pool, I realized how gosh darn stressed out I was while in graduate school.  I guess all that dumb theory freaked me out about the state of the world and then there was the whole I most-likely-won't-find-a-job-thing that I felt like I had been battling everyday.  "What are you going to do with THAT degree?"  People would say.  OR "You want to go into publishing?" (Laugh, laugh, laugh.)  "Well, be prepared for a life of poverty."  Um, uh, THANKS.  But I suppose that is more my problem than their's anyhow.  One really shouldn't let others get under one's skin like that.  It just isn't healthy.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christmas Day: Mr. Winston and Adam looked at one another before rushing to the kitchen.&nbsp; Leigh was a wet, sopping, mess.&nbsp; Tears&nbsp;streamed down her face.&nbsp; She looked from Adam to her father before rushing into her father’s arms.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We…ran…over…the…Baker’s…dog.”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Where’s your mother?”&nbsp; Mr. Winston asked.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “She’s with the Baker’s.&nbsp; We had to wrap the dog in my coat.”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Winston nodded and looked to Adam.&nbsp; “I’m going to get Shelley.&nbsp; You stay here with Leigh.”&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went to the closet to grab his coat and rushed out the door.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Are you okay?”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leigh sniffled.&nbsp; “It was just lying there – and I took it in my arms – and I could feel its heart but then it stopped.”&nbsp; She started to cry again.&nbsp; “I think it’s dead.”&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam reached out his arms towards her and squeezed her to his chest.&nbsp; He could feel a damp spot on his shirt that her tears had stained.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Have you ever felt that way?”&nbsp; Leigh pulled her face away from him.&nbsp; “I mean – like a breath has escaped you somehow and suddenly there is just a body, and then you, and then that’s it?”&nbsp; She wiped some snot from her nose.&nbsp; “I mean – I don’t know what I’m talking about, I don’t even know what I’m saying.”&nbsp; She went to the refrigerator and took out a container of Cranberry juice in a rush.&nbsp; It was the kind of thing Leigh would do when she was nervous, embarrassed by the words that sometimes unleashed in an unbridled fury, seemingly unwittingly, from her mouth.&nbsp; “I’ve just never seen someone – felt anything – just slip away like that.&nbsp; Like someone had decided just then to take it away.&nbsp; But I was still here.&nbsp; Do you know what I mean?”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam thought for a moment.&nbsp; The truth was, he did know what she meant.&nbsp; When he was ten years old, he had been adjusting the old television set in his basement, the old television set that had been replaced by the new big screen set in the family room and got shocked.&nbsp; Not just a little electric shock like when he had leaned over to touch Sandy Newton's arm during school assembly, but really shocked, super shocked, akin to the way he imagined Sylvia Plath or those Cuckoo's Nest characters had been when they were in that awful mental hospital ward biting down on horse bits or whatever.&nbsp; It had happened while he was adjusting the wire hanger that he used for a television antenna with his left hand.&nbsp; A sudden current rushed through his fingers, up his arm, and down his spine and he felt his chin bob up and down, his teeth clatter against each other, his arm pulsate like his mother's Panasonic 2500 massager, and he just stood there, frozen, for what must have been about two minutes, helpless, until its course ran out.&nbsp; Afterwards, when it finally stopped (and he could finally release his hands from the hot, burning, wire) he stood there in a mixture of shock, confusion, and pure bliss at still being (at least what it seemed like) still alive, blankly watching the red of Gilligan's shirt zig zag to grey back to red back to grey back to red, before walking slowly down the hallway, past his sister, watching "General Hospital" in the living room with her two friends.&nbsp; "What are you doing Adam?” She had asked, to which he made no reply.&nbsp; At the foot of the stairs he had heard that lovely, golden, haired, Cassandra Braverman's, whisper, so strangely sharp and clear in his ears, "God your brother's a freak," and then the girls’ united giggle, as he continued up to his bedroom, where he collapsed on his bed and lay there for three hours, motionless, staring up at the florescent light on the ceiling, feeling himself nowhere, somewhere, trapped both inside that bulb and outside, until his mother knocked on his door: "Adam?&nbsp; Is everything alright?"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he could not tell Leigh this – he could not tell her that this particular, inane, moment, was the time when he actually had felt closest to death -- to God -- so instead he looked at her tear stained face, those lovely wide black eyes tinged with tears and said, "I do know what you're talking about," and pulled her towards his large manly chest – or or at least the chest that felt manly in that one brief heroic moment.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really?”&nbsp; she whispered.&nbsp; “I’m not just being dumb?”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Well, kind of – but it’s okay.”&nbsp;

      So I now realize that my recent breakup has me worse off than I've been willing to admit to myself.  (Especially from the looks of these former blog/journal entries which have me complaining incessantly and freaking out about just about everything).  Anyhow, I think I wasn't properly prepared for last night's PARTY -- filled with the crushing voices of people with their own host of troubles -- as my spirited mood was immediately soured by a vicious comment from a girl whose boyfriend I spent some time flirting with.  (He said she was his sister! I'm telling you, Sex and the City simulacrum.  The dude even wished me off by recommending that I don't get too drunk and sleep with any sailors...)  Yep, after that, let's just say my bummed out mood wasn't such a big hit.  But here are some tips from Ang...oh wait, I mean, Richard Feynman that I'm going to try out next time I'm at a party or bar.  I mean, he was a genius quantum physicist who played the drums, he must know, right?  RF's main rule is psychological warfare:  "You are worse than a whore," he tells someone he has bought sandwiches and coffee for $1.10.  His reward: she sleeps with him and repays him for the sandwiches, too.  All's fair."  Hmmmm.  Men have definitely tried this out on me in the past and it has worked.  I wonder if it works for men too or is the proper etiquette to act all ditzy and slutty?  Anyhow got any tips 'cuz this month's Jane magazine (which I have decided is lame pseudo-feminist-snarky-crap run by a self-congratulatory editor-in-chief whose recent plummet in self-confidence may have much to do with the fact that a) she has just turned forty-one and b) that she is fully aware of the fact that she has been exploiting Pamela Anderson's heavily edited boobs for the last year and a half now) has just advised me "to not screw up my next relationship."  Uh, thanks Cosmo, er, uh, I mean, Jane.  Um, so tell me once more why it is always the chick's fault women's magazine written by women for women?  Well, I guess it don't matter none that women like me and girls in their teens inevitably blame themselves for failed relationships when the article heading sounds so, well, let's face it, gosh-darn "sassy."

      Okay, so everyone at Sundance seemed to love Garden State and from the trailer (that Postal Service music playing, Zach Braff standing against that patterned wallpaper in a matching shirt, swimmer girl Nathalie Portman's winning smile...) I figured I would to.&nbsp; Great soundtrack!&nbsp; (The Shins!)&nbsp; Good cast -- Peter Sarsgaard!&nbsp; And best of all, it centered around a cast of lost characters in their early twenties.&nbsp;&nbsp; (For someone as self-absorbed as I, anything closely related to MYSELF equals good).&nbsp;   Um but hey -- not to be a spoil sport here -- but the movie&nbsp;was not so good at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it didn't feel&nbsp;very sincere.&nbsp; It seemed like a screenplay that had been doctored up alot.&nbsp; I could imagine someone giving&nbsp;Mr. Braff that tried and true screenplay workshop advice that (I'm sorry) just doesn't cut it anymore.&nbsp; You know, this kind of advice:   Aging screenplay writer seated at round table in college class room:&nbsp;"Good, Joe.&nbsp; But let's try&nbsp;something different.&nbsp;&nbsp;What if we rewrote this&nbsp;scene so that it wasn't set in a high school but&nbsp; in a pumpkin field&nbsp;inhabited by a family of dwarfs&nbsp;OR&nbsp;what if this&nbsp;character&nbsp;was a psychic&nbsp;Iranian woman with a third eye&nbsp;instead of a white kid from Omaha?"   Not to totally dis this advice (sometimes it works okay like in The Station Agent) but in the case of this movie all the quirky inserts just felt (to me) kind of forced.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and it kind of seemed like the director/writer was good at capturing that exact poignant moment when one's life feels like it is going to change -- three offbeat character holding hands at the edge of a cliff and shouting into the air looks really good and conjures up those bittersweet feelings that you get when you listen to a Cure song or the equivalent of the 00's, a Shins song --&nbsp;but less good at going through the essential motions that make that kind of thing pay off.&nbsp; (The build up, you know?)&nbsp; I mean, cool, we can watch this poignant bittersweet moment but if we don't really get a full picture of the characters&nbsp;and their relationship seems invented SOLELY to get to that feeling, it just doesn't work out so hot.&nbsp; Call it music video influenced film?&nbsp; I dunno.   &nbsp;

      Okay.&nbsp;  Check out this website and then read on. So I don't fear death. I used to (and I'm sure I kind of do) but getting old actually seems scarier than dying. I don't really get the obsession with death.&nbsp; Is it because a small portion of America (the kind that do lots of creative things) don't really have any religion -- a belief in the afterlife, reincarnation, whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that why they just can't deal with the fact that, yes, we die?&nbsp; Cuz we do.&nbsp; And we wouldn't be human if we didn't.&nbsp;  Okay. That's all.

      So we have corporate America and now we have the bizarre Omega Institute which (judging from the website) looks oddly corporate (corporate&nbsp;new age?)&nbsp;doesn't it?&nbsp; And note its "annual report."&nbsp; Sounds decidedly unspiritual, thanks.   I dunno.&nbsp; Maybe I'm getting it all wrong but something about this place is leaving an icky taste in my mouth.&nbsp; (A creepy Vanilla Sky feeling, you know?)&nbsp; And from my experience, the people who have been associated with this place make like they are all healthy and happy but have this&nbsp;total negative, selfish, spoiled, energy lurking beneath their super surface dullard smiles.&nbsp;In my personal opinion, a lot of this holistic/spiritual healing stuff has a way of brainwashing people even though, like anything, in a balanced dose it probably ends up doing some good.

      Sunday's ON LANGUAGE was about "so."&nbsp; I must confess, I commonly use the world "so"&nbsp;inappropriately and in a slang like manner: "so five minutes ago..."&nbsp; And yes, I am well aware that this usage will most likely be outre in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, minutes.   Here's my gripe about Safire (or maybe grammarians in general): Although I find Safire occasionally illuminating, I am no grammarian and I tend to find grammarians unimaginative duds who are only good at following rules.&nbsp; Language rules should be broken and played with.&nbsp; (I&nbsp;feel).&nbsp; &nbsp;Isn't it fun to watch a language mutate and hybridize?&nbsp; Grammarians, in my mind,&nbsp;probably eat a lot of cheese sandwiches on white bread, if you catch my drift.&nbsp;   Although, I must admit, I do respect them grammarians.&nbsp; Kind of the way I respect Nader -- clinging blindly to&nbsp;his ideals despite the futility of it all...

      I have a long line of health care mishaps in my personal life.  My mom was poorly treated and given bad blood when hospitalized years back.  It was blatant discrimination from what I can discern.  When my mother was admitted to the hospital, my father was not with her.  Since she is Korean and speaks with a somewhat heavy accent, they assumed that she did not have health insurance and stuck her in a corner and nurses did not respond to her needs.  My mother, in actuality, did have health insurance, but this is besides the point.  No one -- NO ONE -- regardless of whether or not they are insured, should be treated this way.   I agree that universal health care would be tough and doesn't always work (we could risk the over-prescription of drugs like in Europe and underpaid doctors as in Cuba) but still, if people are sick, people are sick.  Wealth/class/race should not be an issue.  Second, I recently found out that I need an eye operation.  I have this depth perception/double vision problem that manifests "aesthetically" as a lazy/crossed eye.  Besides being ridiculed on occasion for what was in fact a "real" problem not just an "aesthetic problem," this problem went unnoticed until now, when I am twenty-five.  (Partly this is my fault as I, myself, had convinced myself that it wasn't really all that big of a deal as everyone else had always treated it like a look issue -- so I wouldn't be a Seventeen model, big deal.)  But also, this is partly because I think that maybe doctor's thought that because I was a student, I couldn't afford the operation I would need.  Indeed, NYU Health Insurance does not consider double vision to be a real health issue.  Ironically enough, botox was invented for my condition.  And now look -- we have a plethora of people getting plastic surgery and people who can't see super well (and I'm sure there are people out there way worse off than me) can't even get a stupid eye operation to fix their vision.

      Last night, I decided to forego an exciting Saturday evening out and stay in for the night.  All I can say is, it was lovely listening to a Long Island girl who teaches English in Queens' life story from my window and even lovelier to hear the frat boy slumming it in the East Village point out the large rat he saw at Cafe Gigi to the girl he was mostly likely going to pass out on top of mid-coitus later that night.  Whoohoo.  I woke up feeling as damaged and irritated as I would have if I had gone out, downed three pints, and discussed my boring life with a semi-stranger.   I really need to move somewhere grown-up -- especially now that East Village rents are so overpriced.  Anyhow, besides eavesdropping, I decided to start early on the Sunday Times and watch some news.  My first try was Fox.  (I just rented Outfoxed the other night and made a conscious decision to sit through some Murdoch hell).  Anyhow, that Geraldo sure is dumb.  His journalistic reporting seemed like some kind of Robocop/Starship Troopers/E! hybrid style and I proceeded to yell at him along with the idiot lawyer who is attempting to ban sex toys from America.  What's wrong with America????  What has happened to this lovely land that I love???   Oh yeah, and then I watched the Iraqi war reports and yelled at that too.  Give peace a chance???  Oh yeah, and then I was shocked and dismayed to learn that the Olsen twins are taking over/building a penthouse in a NYU dorm.  Um, since when is that okay?  Why don't they just get their own freakin' apartment.  And jeez, doesn't anyone recall that story about the NYU student who was so broke he had to live in the library?  How are people like that going to feel when they see the Olsen twins in their pad?  This is terrible.   Do people just not think anymore?  Anyhow, as I contemplated just this thought, I clicked to a different channel and rapidly began to grow scared and paranoid as the television screen blinked code orange at me and I was told to beware of cyber-stalking.   As I watched the attractively bland anchorwoman spout facts at me, I recalled my friendster profile and other such things and entered a restless sleep, haunted by death threats, war, and Denise, the teacher from Long Island's loud and nauseating voice.  Yes, I too had succumbed to the television marketing of fear -- on a Saturday night, no less.
