						   This is a description of my trip to Shimla with my friends at HCL Technology, Ggn. After just one month of joining at HCL Tech, I planned an expedition to Shimla. It was a fabulous experience. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  31st December 2003, 8:30 PM. I completed packing my bags and was waiting for the clock to struck 9:30, the time when I was supposed to be picked up from my house to leave for the station. The wait was long and my friends seemed to be in a hurry just like me and they were at my doorstep at 8:30 itself. I along with Manpreet, Rishabh and Anirban set out of my house to face a Traffic Jam on the last night of the year 2003. We were bubbling with  excitement and plans that we had created in our minds and stored in our hearts.  We reached the station at 10:05 PM. The train as usual was late by 5 hours. The platform was gloomy and deserted. Some were sleeping on benches while others had lit bon fires to keep them warm on this bone chilling night. We had to wait for 4 hours. We needed to do something exciting. Starting with dinner that each of us had packed for all of us, we ate plenty and  offered the remaining to a dog with a broken leg. To our astonishment he refused to eat our left overs.   As the time passed, we started playing the guitar. We played as if we were "Beatles".  The clock struck 00:00 and the new year started but we were busy enjoying our dinner together at such an exquisite place that no body noticed the time. It was only after we heard some sounds of fireworks that we wished and hugged each other. What a "perfect celebration" on a new year eve it was.    Finally the beautiful sound echoed in our ears "Kripya Dhayan de...  , Howrah se aane waali, dilli, .......paanipat,..... se hoti hui, kalka ko jaane waali Howrah Kalka Mail, platform number 5 par kuch hi samay main aane waali hai..... Ding dong "  We jumped to our ecstacy hearing the beautiful musical tone. Within minutes the train was standing on the track and we made our way through the crowd, which came from no where, to our coach.  We were inside the train. We had decided not to sleep the whole night but we had to share our compartment with an elderly couple who insisted us to lower the middle berth. After a few minutes of hitch hotch, we were on our berths lying lazily. Manpreet, was afraid of his shoes getting stolen found a unique place to hide em. He hung his shoes from the fan on the ceiling of the train. Me and rishabh were on the top berths. Don't ask us what we felt. This was only the start......  The train started and all of us behaved as if we had slept.  -----------------------------------  Day 2  "Chai lelo chai..... " The sounds woke me up from my beutiful dreams on the first morning of the new year. I noticed I was the last to get up. It was already 7:30 and the train was  standing at the Chandigarh station. Looking out of the window, I noticed people starting their day. From the translucent glass window, things looked like the first scene of the song "Maaye ri" .   We got up to brush our teeth but their was already a long queue of people waiting. I saw Anirban standing at the gate smoking his cigerette, which Manpreet would not let him do most of the time.   The train started and we setteled once again. We reached Kalka station at about 9:15 AM and we had to catch a small train to shimla from there. We hurried our luggage and bought the tickets. The tickets were too cheap and costed us Rs 37/- each. The local train which we were supposed to go by, was full. Although there were some good reasons to board into the train ;D, we insisted on going by the Shatabdi Express which was to leave first. Managing to talk to the ticket cheker, we started our four and a half hour journey in the small but beautiful train. It was sunny outside and we started discussing what we would say when we reach back Delhi. Most of us had told  our families that the temperature in shimla was -2 deg. ;D   The journey  was totally different from what I had anticipated. May be the bright sun made it different altogether. Talking from films to ghosts and going up to discussing the existence of God we finally reached Shimla.... The time was flying.....   Surrounded by the crowd of coolies at the station, we were thinking where to go when  Manpreet asked us to pick our loggage and follow him. We followed him on the track frequently looking back if a train was coming. To our relief we reached the bus stand, but Manpreet asked us to continue. Walking up the hill for around 45 minutes carrying our luggage, we SOMEHOW managed to  reach our hotel. We all were sweating and the breeze was blowing cold.    After checking in the hotel which was much better than I had imagined, myself and Rishabh, slept for a couple of hours. We had booked two rooms.   At around 5:30 in the evening when the sun was visible as a red ball, we set out for our first glimpse of Shimla. It was second visit to the paradise and my faint memories came to life.   We spend some time at the Mall Road appreciating the beauty of nature. It was already dark now and the temperature had dropped down to 3 degrees. Beautiful faces that turned red and white due to the cold chill looked even more exquisite. Roaming like free birds in the cold weather we had coffee and reached Ridge. Its where celebrations are done on the new year eve. But thanks to our PM/PL, we missed it by 24 hours.   It was when we were walking on the streets, Rishabh found his penguin. Ask him directly for the details. ;D The fewds between all four of us on small things added to our excitement. Manpreet insisted to buy a cap while we were more interested to search the white cap with grey stripes and a red star. ;D  After walking for a few hours, we started searching for a resturant. We entered the same resturant that I entered 4 years back with my college friends.   Still bubbling with energy and excitement, we decided not to waste the precious time and we kept walking on the beautiful streets. But there was no incentive left now.   Reaching back to our hotel at 10:00 we passed our time talking non sense and dancing to the music. Finally, to conclude the day, Manpreet and I went to our room and slept like good children. I dont know what Anirban and Rishabh did in their rooms.  -----------------------------------  Day 3  The 2nd Day in Shimla started with a cup of bed tea. We all were feeling sleepy but we had to go to "Narconda", to see snow. It was around 70 Kms from Shimla and we heard that the place was heavily snowed. Manpreet, invited his brother Sonu and he inturn invited his friend Sumit. So we were six now. It was 9:00 in the morning and none of us had even started getting ready for the trip. Finally, Manpreet who takes more time than a girl to get dressed started. I followed him within 15 minutes. Listening to music on TV we started our daily jobs. Sonu came to our rooms at 10:00 . He found only me and Anirban ready. As per plans we were to leave by 9:00 but.....  Finally, we decided to hire a cab. We discussed the details and hired a Qualis. We went to market to have breakfast which took another half an hour. The room keys were with Anirban. We had Aalu ke paranthe with achaar. We also packed some for the lunch. Me and Rishabh set out for our hotel to look out for Sonu's friend but forgot to tak keys from Anirban. We had to wait outside. But, when we saw the time, we decided not to go to Narconda. It was 12:30 and we were to leave in another half an hour at the earliest. Manpreet came to our rescue with the keys. But instead we had a heated discussion with him. He insisted us to go to narconda that day itself but Rishabh and I were not to listen.  We were victorius. The plan was cancelled.   At around 1:00 PM we started for Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, not for studies but for different reasons. According to Manpreet it was a palace and according to Sonu, it was a delight for bird watching. I wanted to go to Jakhu temple but with all these rouges, I had to accept. We went there but it was a deserted building. It was a nice place for photography as the institute for built in 19th century. We took many snaps there and finally departed for the museum. According to Sonu, it was a god place to visit but I didn't find anything worth seeing. Outside the museum, we had our lunch (the same paranthas, that we packed in the morning) . After that we cancelled our return tickets at the railway station and started for the Mall road after stopping at a resturant for a brief period.  Manpreet lost all his energy while climbing the road to Mall. Our next destination was Jaakhu. It was around 5:30 and was getting dark. Manpreet Sonu and Sumit stayed back at Mall Road (dont ask me for what reasons, as manpreet ;D) while me, rishabh and anirban started. It was a 2 KMs journey but was a slope of 45 degrees everywhere. We were already exhausted but we continued to walk up. In the way we were searched by a group of monkeys. This happened to me 4 years back too so I was prepared. Finally after 3 more such searches, we reached the temple. After coming out of the temple, the fear of monkeys had somewhat vanished. We asked the prasaad wala to take our snap with monkeys sitting all around us. He sprinkled the prasad on us and the monkeys were everywhere on us . It was a real adventure.  Finally, while coming down we started discussing the benefits of temples and should one visit such places. I was in favour but the two were against. Reaching down the Mall road again, we started on our business of roaming at the mall road. Anirban flashed his Barista coupons he carried from Delhi which entitled us to buy one get one free scheme. When we showed the coupons, he told us these were valid only in Delhi. To protect our dignity, we decided not to step out and ordered coffee. Rishabh, ordered DOPEYO for himself and asked us to order it for ourselves too. Anirban and myself agreed to him thinking it was a strong coffee and we both wold like it.  I am never gonna forgive Rishabh for what he did... It was worse than poison. It was then I understood the meaning of the term DOPE+YOU. He doped us.  Scolding him and giving him KITA all the way down we reached lower bazaar for some shopping. It was where some of us bought shawls etc. during the day we had already walked around 15 KMs on hill that we had no energy left.We decided to leave for our hotel rooms. In the rooms, we talked for some times when finally Sonu and his friend departed. At around 9:00 we felt butterflies in our stomach due to hunger. Anirban and Rishabh were interested in having non-veg. Manpreet was in a mood of resting so the other three of us decided  to go and get some food from the mall. All three of us wanted to go but Manpreet the hitler, wanted one person to stay with him. Dont ask me why !!  Finally, Rishabh and me voluteered to go all the way uphill to mall and get the food. The mall was deserted now. Without much enjoyment, we just bought some food and came back to hotel . Manpreet the fool-kumari was feling so tired and so cold that he had to be served food on hs bed. Well, We dined together and then started watching television. Finally, Rishabh and Anirban went to their room and I know what they did, but I am not supposed to tell you that.  I was fast asleep when I heard the snoarings of Manpreet. I had no choice but to put my pillow on my ears and sleep back. --------------------------------  Day 4   The last day in shimla was a bit nostalgic. We got up in the morning and started packing our luggage as we had to check out from the hotel. Manpreet's mama ji had invited us to spend the last day at his place. As usual, Manpreet and Rishabh were the last to get ready. Sonu came at around 9:30 and he was shocked to see us "not ready".  The cab arrived at the hotel and we checked out quickly at 11:00 AM. We headed straight for Mamaji's house. It was just 5 KM away from where we spent our last two days. It was a good place and we comforted ourselves. Mamiji had prepared Aalu sabji and poori for breakfast. It was delicious. Stuffing ourselves with the home made food that we didn't have for the last 3 days, we set out for our journey at 12:15. "No use for cancelling yesterday's program" , I thought to myself.  The road to Narconda was full of green valleys and landscape was rich. The deodaar trees extending from the valley reached up hign in the sky blocking the sun. We were full of hopes to see the snow and the level of excitement showed when we saw the first patch of snow on the roadside. It was just handful of snow and we wanted to stop the car and take some snaps. After going up the hill for about 1.5 hours, the magnificient snow lofted peaks of himalayas started to show up at the horizon.  The view was so magnificient that we captured the scenic beauty in many photographs.  Just by a mere glance of the distant mountains, realized the difficulties and dangers, one could face while mountaineering. I can still feel the cool breeze and see the beautiful landsape when I close my eyes.   Not stopping anywhere in between, we continued our journey. After around 2 hours, we reached a deserted road. The roads were not built and only one vehicle could pass through at a time. It was still sunny and we could see the distant mountains very clearly. We had left the snow patches behind and now we could only see the shrubs and dusty road. After travellng for another half an hour, the snow started to show again. The driver warned us that we wont get enough snow even at Narconda. We were depressed. Still not deterred, we continued our trip with hopeful hearts.  We reached Narconda !! But where is the snow ??? We could only see patches of snow here and there just like what we had seen on the way. Some one told us that the place for skiing is further up and we would have to walk up to that place. We parked our car and started for our mission. To find the snow.  After three and a half hour of journeys, we emptied our bags, and started walking. The first location was a small hut shaped house with snow all around it. Not caring about our clothes getting wet or our hands getting frostbitten, we jumped in. Manpreet by this time started feeling feverish.  He reluctantly, stepped in but didn't play. Taking many photographs with the beautiful background and our creativity at its peak, we left the place to explore more. As we moved forward, we saw a hill fully covered with virgin snow. We were in an ecstacy to jump from the top of it but it was rocky underneath. Also there were snake holes in there as signalled by the small temple devoted to naag devta. The approach road had developed a film of ice on its surface and it was very slippery. Some how placing our steps carefully we moved forward.  We captured the wonderful moments  in our cameras but this much of snow was not enough for us. We wanted to burry our legs inside and make balls of snow to throw on each other. The coldness of snow changed our ideas. Till now we were walking on one side of the mountain and as we took a hair pin turn, from no where a big mountain fully covered with brilliantly shining snow appeared. We all left with no words to admire it. I still dont have words to explain the beauty. It was our first time that we had seen so much of snow. We jumped and rushed to reach the top of the slope. It was not as easy to walk on the snow as we had anticipated. Managing to reach up we just appreciated the beauty of nature for some time. The perfect combination of green and white colours with red coloured apple trees made us feel we were at the gates of heaven. On the sloapy side of the hill, people were skiiing, while on the plain edge of the mountain, naives like us were falling from their ski-shoes. It was a wonderful moment for all of us. We saw a long slope and I immidiately decided to slip down it. I was warned by Sonu but I was not to listen. I did it and really enjoyed but by the time I reached down my jeans was wet and my hands and face were frozen. But it was worth the fun. Running from one side to other and enjoying as if we had been freed from a prison, we reached the plains again. It was like a skating rink. With a layer of frozen water on the surface, we decided to try out some sports. We hired a pair of skies. In my mind I had dreamed of skiing from the hill at 80 MPH, just the way they do on TV. But in actual, I had to push myself on the plain surface with the pair of two sticks. It was a tiresome job without any fun or adventure. I wanted to go on the slope but the ski-wala bhai warned me against.  I fell three times and decided to disarm myself.  Next was Anirban trying his sportsmenship. He fell 8 times and still he says, he was doing it better than me ;D Rishabh and Manpreet with their big feats were not able to experiece the game. We spent around 3 hours at the paradise and we finally decided to come back. In the way, we stopped at a small dhaba where we burnt some wood and warmed ourselves. All our jeans and socks were wet and the breeze was coldly blowing. Our dreams of ligting a bonfire was thus fulfilled.   Starting back on our journey, Rishabh and I discussed all sorts of things that bored the other three. Finally, we were at one end of the Mall road, where we encountered the same stupid question by the owner of the cab " Aa gaye aap log". According to Manpreet, he was feeling very cold and had developed fever but we didn't listen to him. He wanted to go back but we forced him to accompany us to the lakkad baazar. The place from where I bought a "belan". (now dont take it in a wrong sense ;D) . We shopped for some time and then started for Manaji's house. Our legs were aching by now and we missed the last direct bus so we had to walk another mile to reach him home. After resting for some time, we had the dinner. Our beds were ready and a heater was switched on for our comfort. Manpreet the weakling, was the first to lie down on the bed. Four of us along with Sonu, started talking and spent sometime. At 11:30 we all realized that we had to leave the next day and we decided to sleep. Although a seperate bed was arranged by god soul sonu, we decided to sleep on a single bed. Four of us slept on a double bed. Manpreet was making funny sounds before sleeping. Something like a camel makes when he is left alone in a desert that led to another 15 minutes of laughter. We dont know when we fell asleep but at 3:00 AM I realized that the three of my friends had taken away my blankets and I was freezing in the chill. I had to pull my right from the them and slept back.........  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Day 5.....   Getting up in the morning was again a difficult task. Knowing the fact that we have to go to office from next day made it even more cumber some. I was again the last person to leave the bed. We had two cups of tea with great kindness of Maamiji. Sonu, the good soul, allowed us to relax on the bed for another 15 minutes while talking to him. We had to hurry up as our bus was to leave at 10:00 AM. We all were already ready as we didn't change our clothes the day before. After the nature call we all got together on the breakfast table where we had butter toast. Manpreet was yet again the last person to finish. It was 9:20 and we had to hurry up to catch the bus. Quickly we clicked a few group photographs with mamaji and mamaji. and stuffed our luggage in the maruti 800. We had with us, 8 bags and a guitar. we were 4 (including lambu ji) and Sonu was the driver.  You can now imagine how we fitted in the car. When we reached the bus stop, Sonu had to pull us out of the car ;D  Afraid of missing the bus, me Rishabh and Sonu ran in different directions to get information. We were lost. Finally somehow we managed to buy the tickets to chandigarh. The bus was about to leave in another 5 minutes. After a sentimental good bye and a parting gift to Sonu we setteled. Unfortunately, Rishabh sat on the seat behind mine. I had to adjust my seat so as to accomodate the giant. The bus started and so did the feuds between Hitler bhai and Rishabh. Anirban slept for some time but was woken up by hitler bhai to put the guitar. I was busy capturing the last moments of the trip in my mind with my window open. Hitler bhai ordered me to shut it.   The journey continued smoothly for sometime but when we were coming down the hill, hitler bhai again started feeling sick. He went and sat on the last seat of the bus : )  The bus reached Candigarh at 2:00 PM where we rushed to buy the tickets to Delhi. The bus was supposed to leave at 2:20. We were the last ones to buy the tickets so e got the last seat. But atleast there was sufficient leg space. The bus started at 2:10 itself as all the seats were full. We stopped the bus for another 5 minutes and went for emergency.   Finally, we were again in the bus. The journey started and we started talking nonsense. Rishabh wanted to play the guitar to the penguin sitting on the front seat. We didn't let him play : )  We all were hungry and we bought some snacks. Partying around for the first few minutes we dont know when all of  us fell asleep. The whether was getting colder as we approached Delhi. At aound 4:15 the bus reached Panipat. It stopped there for 10 minutes during which we had our lunch that comprised of Chole Kulche. I never had a lunch worse than that. Anirban was intelligent to order a sandwich. After quickly finishing the lunch (or supper ) we were about to board the bus again when I noticed Rishabh's true and very own Penguin. Finally, we found it.  Rishabh, also gathered the courage to stand next to her and I took a snap. I'll show you the photograph when we meet. ;D  The bus started again and the wait to reach Delhi continued. Finally we saw the board welcoming us back to Delhi. I was by now very tired and thanked god for reaching back to home. Rishabh and Manpreet got down at By-Pass and I dont know how they managed to reach back home. Anirban's mobile suddenly started to ring non stop and he left me alone while talking to people. After half an hour we reached the ISBT. Getting down and facing the severe chill, Anirban and I found an Autorickshaw. He dropped us just before the Dhaula Kuan flyover when his Auto broke down. anirban walked down to the bus stop while I walked for a few minutes and hired another autoriskshaw. Finally I reached back HOME, My Sweet Home.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was 12:30 and we were to leave in another half an hour at the earliest. Manpreet came to our rescue with the keys. But instead we had a heated discussion with him. He insisted us to go to narconda that day itself but Rishabh and I were not to listen. We were victorius. The plan was cancelled.   At around 1:00 PM we started for Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, not for studies but for different reasons. According to Manpreet it was a palace and according to Sonu, it was a delight for bird watching. I wanted to go to Jakhu temple but with all these rouges, I had to accept. We went there but it was a deserted building. It was a nice place for photography as the institute for built in 19th century. We took many snaps there and finally departed for the museum. According to Sonu, it was a god place to visit but I didn't find anything worth seeing. Outside the museum, we had our lunch (the same paranthas, that we packed in the morning) . After that we cancelled our return tickets at the railway station and started for the Mall road after stopping at a resturant for a brief period.  Manpreet lost all his energy while climbing the road to Mall. Our next destination was Jaakhu. It was around 5:30 and was getting dark. Manpreet Sonu and Sumit stayed back at Mall Road (dont ask me for what reasons, as manpreet ;D) while me, rishabh and anirban started. It was a 2 KMs journey but was a slope of 45 degrees everywhere. We were already exhausted but we continued to walk up. In the way we were searched by a group of monkeys. This happened to me 4 years back too so I was prepared. Finally after 3 more such searches, we reached the temple. After coming out of the temple, the fear of monkeys had somewhat vanished. We asked the prasaad wala to take our snap with monkeys sitting all around us. He sprinkled the prasad on us and the monkeys were everywhere on us . It was a real adventure.  Finally, while coming down we started discussing the benefits of temples and should one visit such places. I was in favour but the two were against. Reaching down the Mall road again, we started on our business of roaming at the mall road. Anirban flashed his Barista coupons he carried from Delhi which entitled us to buy one get one free scheme. When we showed the coupons, he told us these were valid only in Delhi. To protect our dignity, we decided not to step out and ordered coffee. Rishabh, ordered DOPEYO for himself and asked us to order it for ourselves too. Anirban and myself agreed to him thinking it was a strong coffee and we both wold like it. I am never gonna forgive Rishabh for what he did... It was worse than poison. It was then I understood the meaning of the term DOPE+YOU. He doped us.  Scolding him and giving him KITA all the way down we reached lower bazaar for some shopping. It was where some of us bought shawls etc. during the day we had already walked around 15 KMs on hill that we had no energy left.We decided to leave for our hotel rooms. In the rooms, we talked for some times when finally Sonu and his friend departed. At around 9:00 we felt butterflies in our stomach due to hunger. Anirban and Rishabh were interested in having non-veg. Manpreet was in a mood of resting so the other three of us decided to go and get some food from the mall. All three of us wanted to go but Manpreet the hitler, wanted one person to stay with him. Dont ask me why !!  Finally, Rishabh and me voluteered to go all the way uphill to mall and get the food. The mall was deserted now. Without much enjoyment, we just bought some food and came back to hotel . Manpreet the fool-kumari was feling so tired and so cold that he had to be served food on hs bed. Well, We dined together and then started watching television. Finally, Rishabh and Anirban went to their room and I know what they did, but I am not supposed to tell you that.  I was fast asleep when I heard the snoarings of Manpreet. I had no choice but to put my pillow on my ears and sleep back. __________________________  Day 4  The last day in shimla was a bit nostalgic. We got up in the morning and started packing our luggage as we had to check out from the hotel. Manpreet's mama ji had invited us to spend the last day at his place. As usual, Manpreet and Rishabh were the last to get ready. Sonu came at around 9:30 and he was shocked to see us "not ready".  The cab arrived at the hotel and we checked out quickly at 11:00 AM. We headed straight for Mamaji's house. It was just 5 KM away from where we spent our last two days. It was a good place and we comforted ourselves. Mamiji had prepared Aalu sabji and poori for breakfast. It was delicious. Stuffing ourselves with the home made food that we didn't have for the last 3 days, we set out for our journey at 12:15. "No use for cancelling yesterday's program" , I thought to myself.  The road to Narconda was full of green valleys and landscape was rich. The deodaar trees extending from the valley reached up hign in the sky blocking the sun. We were full of hopes to see the snow and the level of excitement showed when we saw the first patch of snow on the roadside. It was just handful of snow and we wanted to stop the car and take some snaps. After going up the hill for about 1.5 hours, the magnificient snow lofted peaks of himalayas started to show up at the horizon. The view was so magnificient that we captured the scenic beauty in many photographs. Just by a mere glance of the distant mountains, realized the difficulties and dangers, one could face while mountaineering. I can still feel the cool breeze and see the beautiful landsape when I close my eyes.   Not stopping anywhere in between, we continued our journey. After around 2 hours, we reached a deserted road. The roads were not built and only one vehicle could pass through at a time. It was still sunny and we could see the distant mountains very clearly. We had left the snow patches behind and now we could only see the shrubs and dusty road. After travellng for another half an hour, the snow started to show again. The driver warned us that we wont get enough snow even at Narconda. We were depressed. Still not deterred, we continued our trip with hopeful hearts.  We reached Narconda !! But where is the snow ??? We could only see patches of snow here and there just like what we had seen on the way. Some one told us that the place for skiing is further up and we would have to walk up to that place. We parked our car and started for our mission. To find the snow.  After three and a half hour of journeys, we emptied our bags, and started walking. The first location was a small hut shaped house with snow all around it. Not caring about our clothes getting wet or our hands getting frostbitten, we jumped in. Manpreet by this time started feeling feverish. He reluctantly, stepped in but didn't play. Taking many photographs with the beautiful background and our creativity at its peak, we left the place to explore more. As we moved forward, we saw a hill fully covered with virgin snow. We were in an ecstacy to jump from the top of it but it was rocky underneath. Also there were snake holes in there as signalled by the small temple devoted to naag devta. The approach road had developed a film of ice on its surface and it was very slippery. Some how placing our steps carefully we moved forward.  We captured the wonderful moments in our cameras but this much of snow was not enough for us. We wanted to burry our legs inside and make balls of snow to throw on each other. The coldness of snow changed our ideas. Till now we were walking on one side of the mountain and as we took a hair pin turn, from no where a big mountain fully covered with brilliantly shining snow appeared. We all left with no words to admire it. I still dont have words to explain the beauty. It was our first time that we had seen so much of snow. We jumped and rushed to reach the top of the slope. It was not as easy to walk on the snow as we had anticipated. Managing to reach up we just appreciated the beauty of nature for some time. The perfect combination of green and white colours with red coloured apple trees made us feel we were at the gates of heaven. On the sloapy side of the hill, people were skiiing, while on the plain edge of the mountain, naives like us were falling from their ski-shoes. It was a wonderful moment for all of us. We saw a long slope and I immidiately decided to slip down it. I was warned by Sonu but I was not to listen. I did it and really enjoyed but by the time I reached down my jeans was wet and my hands and face were frozen. But it was worth the fun. Running from one side to other and enjoying as if we had been freed from a prison, we reached the plains again. It was like a skating rink. With a layer of frozen water on the surface, we decided to try out some sports. We hired a pair of skies. In my mind I had dreamed of skiing from the hill at 80 MPH, just the way they do on TV. But in actual, I had to push myself on the plain surface with the pair of two sticks. It was a tiresome job without any fun or adventure. I wanted to go on the slope but the ski-wala bhai warned me against. I fell three times and decided to disarm myself.  Next was Anirban trying his sportsmenship. He fell 8 times and still he says, he was doing it better than me ;D Rishabh and Manpreet with their big feats were not able to experiece the game. We spent around 3 hours at the paradise and we finally decided to come back. In the way, we stopped at a small dhaba where we burnt some wood and warmed ourselves. All our jeans and socks were wet and the breeze was coldly blowing. Our dreams of ligting a bonfire was thus fulfilled.   Starting back on our journey, Rishabh and I discussed all sorts of things that bored the other three. Finally, we were at one end of the Mall road, where we encountered the same stupid question by the owner of the cab " Aa gaye aap log". According to Manpreet, he was feeling very cold and had developed fever but we didn't listen to him. He wanted to go back but we forced him to accompany us to the lakkad baazar. The place from where I bought a "belan". (now dont take it in a wrong sense ;D) . We shopped for some time and then started for Manaji's house. Our legs were aching by now and we missed the last direct bus so we had to walk another mile to reach him home. After resting for some time, we had the dinner. Our beds were ready and a heater was switched on for our comfort. Manpreet the weakling, was the first to lie down on the bed. Four of us along with Sonu, started talking and spent sometime. At 11:30 we all realized that we had to leave the next day and we decided to sleep. Although a seperate bed was arranged by god soul sonu, we decided to sleep on a single bed. Four of us slept on a double bed. Manpreet was making funny sounds before sleeping. Something like a camel makes when he is left alone in a desert that led to another 15 minutes of laughter. We dont know when we fell asleep but at 3:00 AM I realized that the three of my friends had taken away my blankets and I was freezing in the chill. I had to pull my right from the them and slept back.........  __________________________  Day 5.....  Getting up in the morning was again a difficult task. Knowing the fact that we have to go to office from next day made it even more cumber some. I was again the last person to leave the bed. We had two cups of tea with great kindness of Maamiji. Sonu, the good soul, allowed us to relax on the bed for another 15 minutes while talking to him. We had to hurry up as our bus was to leave at 10:00 AM. We all were already ready as we didn't change our clothes the day before. After the nature call we all got together on the breakfast table where we had butter toast. Manpreet was yet again the last person to finish. It was 9:20 and we had to hurry up to catch the bus. Quickly we clicked a few group photographs with mamaji and mamaji. and stuffed our luggage in the maruti 800. We had with us, 8 bags and a guitar. we were 4 (including lambu ji) and Sonu was the driver. You can now imagine how we fitted in the car. When we reached the bus stop, Sonu had to pull us out of the car ;D  Afraid of missing the bus, me Rishabh and Sonu ran in different directions to get information. We were lost. Finally somehow we managed to buy the tickets to chandigarh. The bus was about to leave in another 5 minutes. After a sentimental good bye and a parting gift to Sonu we setteled. Unfortunately, Rishabh sat on the seat behind mine. I had to adjust my seat so as to accomodate the giant. The bus started and so did the feuds between Hitler bhai and Rishabh. Anirban slept for some time but was woken up by hitler bhai to put the guitar. I was busy capturing the last moments of the trip in my mind with my window open. Hitler bhai ordered me to shut it.   The journey continued smoothly for sometime but when we were coming down the hill, hitler bhai again started feeling sick. He went and sat on the last seat of the bus : )  The bus reached Candigarh at 2:00 PM where we rushed to buy the tickets to Delhi. The bus was supposed to leave at 2:20. We were the last ones to buy the tickets so e got the last seat. But atleast there was sufficient leg space. The bus started at 2:10 itself as all the seats were full. We stopped the bus for another 5 minutes and went for emergency.   Finally, we were again in the bus. The journey started and we started talking nonsense. Rishabh wanted to play the guitar to the penguin sitting on the front seat. We didn't let him play : )  We all were hungry and we bought some snacks. Partying around for the first few minutes we dont know when all of us fell asleep. The whether was getting colder as we approached Delhi. At aound 4:15 the bus reached Panipat. It stopped there for 10 minutes during which we had our lunch that comprised of Chole Kulche. I never had a lunch worse than that. Anirban was intelligent to order a sandwich. After quickly finishing the lunch (or supper ) we were about to board the bus again when I noticed Rishabh's true and very own Penguin. Finally, we found it. Rishabh, also gathered the courage to stand next to her and I took a snap. I'll show you the photograph when we meet. ;D  The bus started again and the wait to reach Delhi continued. Finally we saw the board welcoming us back to Delhi. I was by now very tired and thanked god for reaching back to home. Rishabh and Manpreet got down at By-Pass and I dont know how they managed to reach back home. Anirban's mobile suddenly started to ring non stop and he left me alone while talking to people. After half an hour we reached the ISBT. Getting down and facing the severe chill, Anirban and I found an Autorickshaw. He dropped us just before the Dhaula Kuan flyover when his Auto broke down. anirban walked down to the bus stop while I walked for a few minutes and hired another autoriskshaw. Finally I reached back HOME, My Sweet Home.  __________________________ **************************

						   19 Dec'04 11:30 PM  The little fog made the visibility go down. The sun looked like a big red apple and the birds seemed to rush towards it. It was chilling and I was on my terrace. The cold breeze froze my bones and I sipped from the cup of tea holding it tight in my hands. I wanted to stay there for more time but then I looked at my watch and I was already late for office.   On my way, once again I was asking myself the same questions that has bothered me for the past few years.  What are we doing ?? Why are we here ? Do we have any purpose in our life ? What is it? I keep asking these question to myself and the more I think, the more I get confused. When I look at the people around me, I find myself in a struggle. A struggle to do better. But do we actually know what is it that we want to DO ?   Is it money or is it power? What after both ?? In the busy world that we have created around us, how much time do we keep for ourselves ?  I have a good family, good health, a good job and good friends and I am a happy person alltogether but I am not satisfied. I want more. What is it, I don't know !!   I firmly believe that "whatever happens, happens for a cause" . Then what is the cause for which we are here on this planet we call earth ? Why are we doing what we are doing? Can we really say that we are leading a better life than what our ancestors lived ? Think a little and be honest, you are answering to yourself.

						    18 Dec'04, 9:35 AM    In the morning while coming, I had a dream. "Weather was cold and chilling, and I was going on my 4 wheel drive. I had a Nikon camera with me and through the clouds I was shooting beautiful snow covered mountains, wild life, and Kancha boiling water in an aluminium kettle hanging on fire. I was having tea sitting outside a hut type dhaba along the roadside on a snow covered mountain working on my Laptop trying to figure out my next destination".   God hears my prayers very fast it seems. I am sitting on a chair that has a broken wheel and it has only 4 wheels now. Whether is obviously cold. I am downloading the pictures of mountains and wild life from webshots sipping tea and working on my computer making plans for the day.   Its only perception that matters afterall...

						   The lights were dim, soothing instrumental music was playing in background and the temperature was just fine. I was sitting on the ground cross legged, concentrating on my breath. Yes, I was meditating. It was my first time that I tried meditation seriously and I am glad that sooner or later, I realized the effects it can have on one's body, mind and soul. I feel refreshed now and more calm than ever before. The chaos that was there in my mind has subsided now to a great extent.  Hating the way I used to spend my weekends, I decided to do something different today and surprisingly, first thing that came to my mind was "Meditation" I quickly searched through the net and gathered some basic information on meditation. Next, I downloaded some soothing music that would help a novice like me to meditate effectively. It Worked!! Meditation was not as difficult as I had anticipated. I feel it just requires a regular practice and total dedication. But it can do wonders and give new meanings to the life.
