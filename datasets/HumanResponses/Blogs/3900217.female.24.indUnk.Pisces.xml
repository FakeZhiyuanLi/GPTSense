       urlLink    No real reason for this picture, expect it made me think about relationships and how many of my relationship in the past weren't built on trust, they were built on lies. They were lies coming from me, things I thought I wanted people to believe in, yet could hold no water...it's amazing how the false self can fool everyone, including me...&nbsp; urlLink

      So, over the past two years, I have learned more about how to grieve and how our society doesn't know how to do it.  Trust me, I'm still learning how to do it properly.  But I'm sitting here in class (that's right I'm at Bethel) and I'm running through a list of things that I am grieving through.  It's so hard and yes, some of them are superficial, but I'm grieving through: 1.  LeRon Shults, an old theology professor I had...He's fantastic 2.  That part of my inner circle isn't here...it's so tough without them 3.  That Boulevard Beer isn't sold in Chicago, but is in St. Paul 4.  That "I love the 90's" is starting on VH1 and I'm in class   Don't laugh, but they are true...learning how to give up lesser dreams in order to receive better, more fulfilling dreams is never easy but it's worth it...I'll let you know how things are going soon.

      So, in order to keep people updated in my life, I knew that I could use this as opposed to regular email.  Let me tell you what I hope this site will accomplish: 1.  I want to be able to show people what I am learning, not only at my seminary, but through the beautiful people I interact with on a daily basis.  2.  I want to share with people great books, quotes, music, etc here.  Things that matter to me I hope to share with you.  3.  I just want to give you some of my thoughts and my journey.  It's only so I can process more clearly on this crazy journey I have been on recently.  Otherwise, this is for you.  For you to see a piece into my life and the things that are going on here.  I hope you enjoy this page as much as I enjoy writing it.

      Yesterday, I saw Fahrenheit 9/11, the provocative documentary by Michael Moore. Whether you agree with Bush or not, you should definitely see this movie. Waiting for it to come out on DVD would be fine, but I was fortunate enough to see it at the $5 movie theater here in the suburbs. So what, you may ask, did I think of it?  Well, I need to remember that it is only one side of the story. I walked into the theater almost 90% sure I was going to vote against Bush in November. That's something I have been debating with since probably the end of April. I just didn't know if I could put him back in the directors chair again. But now, I don't know if I could vote for either Bush or Kerry. If the connections are true, and the ties run that deep, then no one deserves to have that seat. I definitely don't think I could do any better, but the idea of someone, anyone, plotting in such a way...yikes...  I did, however, walk away with a greater respect of the military system we have established here in the states. I am proud to support them and the work they are doing. I may not agree that it is necessary, but I support the men and women who have left their families because it is part of their job. My family has a huge background in the military (with my grandfather in World War II and my cousin in the first Gulf War, both my uncles and my father in the National Guard, as well as my brother in the National Guard), so I feel like I should thank them for the service they have done because I know that I could never do it.  So, if you read this and don't agree with me, that's fine, I don't know if I agree with everything that Moore placed in his movie. I almost want to see it again. As for November, I'm still deciding to vote. I know I won't vote for Bush, but I don't know if I'll even vote.

      So, I finally made it back from school. No, it didn't take a week to get back, but little did I know that the Willow gods would prevent me from posting on my own blog, so it took a little longer to post than I would like. Now, I am sitting in a Kinko's, using their free internet in order to catch you up on Bethel.  Let's see, what did happen...Theology 3 was good, nothing earth shattering (unlike Theology 1), but still a decent class. I enjoy the adjuct profs. They tend to stray from what the Bethel gods feel like they need to teach on, which is always a nice change of pace. Thanks to internet in class, I was able to catch up with my college roommate, a woman I love dearly and miss, yet even when I am home, I feel like I never get a chance to catch up with. She's wonderful (she's actually the one who encouraged me to cook...thanks Brooklyn). So, she turned me and my dear friend Sara onto the best blog I have ever read. I can only hope that one day, mine could be like her's. Check it out here:  urlLink http://www.dooce.com/ . Trust me, you'll laugh, you'll cry, and if you are anything like Sara and I, you'll want to invite her to a Good Friday here in Chicago. You'll have to ask me about Good Fridays.  Team Leadership, well, it wasn't anything special. I wish I could say something nice, something that I gleaned from the class, yet it's difficult to say. The man is nice, two of the field trips gave me hope for the church and my future applying to them, the other made me want to switch careers quickly. I caught up on my web surfing and had the opportunity to watch U2, which gives me hope that one day I will see them in concert...soon...  Otherwise, when I first arrived there, I was in a sad, lonely, needy spot. This time was different, not because I was new or because my profs were new, but because I was without people I love dearly and who know me deeply. These are people that don't ask me why I am the way I am, but they just let me be. They left, well not left, but graduated and now it is different without them. It was just difficult. I stayed around safe people and didn't really do as much as I thought I would this time. I just didn't have the energy to anything. Grieving is difficult and it just shows me what is to come.  And yes, I did drink Boulevard beer while I was there, and that my friends (along with talks at Old Chicago) was my saving grace.  Oh and by the way, I'm trying to work on my resume...I would love to find a job by the time I graduate in 313 days (not that I am counting down or anything).

      Dreams were meant to be broken I suppose. Or perhaps tweaked. What if you could go change your dreams (the true dreams of your sleep)? Do you think that is possible? I don't. With that being the case, I don't think it would be possible to change your "real life" dreams. You bring a very good point to the table though. Perhaps, I have the wrong dream-changer in mind. I am incapable, but He is not.  So here I remain in KC. Such a common prayer to hold on to in these times...not my will, but yours be done.  Yet, as one thing subsides another comes rolling in. Not that visions of houses don't dance in my head, but temporary relief comes in many forms. Several things have happened that bring me to a new, renewed place. Starting off, a ministry followed up with a little extra cash and visions of new couches to dance in my head. :) Long versions to follow...of course.  I am blessed with the ability to look at nearly any one's life and from an outsiders viewpoint tell them precisely what they need to hear, or objectively view a problem and provide a solution. It never seems to fail me that the mirror is always foggy when trying to look at myself. I am almost never capable of discernment within my own life. Thank God for an honest and trustable (is that even a word? if it isn't...it should be) husband.  We talked more on Sunday night and as I had tried to work things out of my head on our blog I felt myself searching for something, anything.  He said those exact words to me later that evening.  That I was searching and I just needed to be patient because God would provide whatever it was I was searching for.  I never could have found it on my own, but when he said it it was like turning the light on in a pitch black room.  I felt reassured that God was faithful and all in good time it would work out.  Thankfully he is quick to come when you really need direction.  The next day it all came together.  I reflected on my reaction to something someone had said at our small group (about someone's mother who use to house pregnant teens during their pregnancy).  It had really stirred me, it seemed so exciting and so valient of a cause.  This has, unsurprisingly, been a cause that reoccuringly causes my heart to bubble up.  So, I decided to look online and see what sort of ministries or facilities there were that dealt with these matters.  LIGHT House immediately came to mind.  I went to their website and surfed the whole thing.  Sitting here in front of the monitor reading their mission, their needs, their vision I began to cry.  Boy, I thought, I'm either really emotional today or it is no small coincidence how things are seeming to come together.  Shot off an email to their volunteer coordinator and immediately received an email in return.    "Oh, Tiffany!!!!!  How we have waited for YOU!!!!  The Lord provides just when we need Him to…we should never doubt that for one second, should we?"   I will be serving in their ministry probably helping with their aftercare (where they work with the girls mentoring...which is exactly what I told her I would be most interested in among other things).  Timing is everything, huh?  Secondly, I am watching a friends baby once a week all day.  It's for meer peanuts, but a nice favor.  Chris offered, I know this may seem silly...but it is a truly kind gesture, that we could use that money to buy couches (to make payments on one of those 0% deals).  It's for me having to be "stuck" in the place I am for now.  We had originally planned on waiting to get couches til our next place so we wouldn't have to move them.   It was just really sweet.  I was feeling very discouraged by how much I was going to be paid and he made what was nothing in to something for me.  I think I will take you up on your book offers even though it seems all is well...I know it's only for now.  We'll talk tomorrow...so I'm off to save some for later.

      It sounds like you are in a huge predicament. And if I'm honest, I don't know what to tell you. I'm sure you aren't even looking for advice, but still, I wouldn't know where to begin, the only thing I can do is tell you some of the things I have learned on this crazy journey I've been on for the past two years.  First of all, I don't know if we are ever satisfied or content. I think because of our limitations and the way we were created, we will always be in want. That's part of our limitations. And these desires, the things we think will satisfy us, it's only masking our greater desire, which is a transformational love relationship with the Trinity. A desire for a bigger yard, a nice house, more money...These all are lesser dreams to the one true dream: to know and be known and to love and be loved in a radical way. It isn't until we truly surrender the dreams we have and when we begin to realize that these dreams, as good as they may be, are nothing in comparison to what is offered to us through this radical love of the Trinity. And until we first realize how much we are loved, then we can begin the process of doing the death, burial, and resurrection of our dreams and our lives. I highly recommend reading both "Shattered Dreams" by Larry Crabb and "Surrender to Love" by David Benner...They might help you gain some perspective.  So the question becomes what do we do in the midst of our dreams, our desires, things we think are good and things we  think  we deserve, but are they truly the best God has for us. Is submitting those dreams easy? Hell no! But is the reward on the other side worth it? Without a pause, yes (actually, I would use something more expressive here, but I don't know if I can)...  ps-you never answered my question regarding the phone...do we still get to talk there?

      The problem with indifference is the major hiccup it brings in making a decision.  To be heavily persuaded one way or another makes it much simpler to come to any type of conclusion, be it major or minor.  In such a situation I am.  Chris has put his resume out to a company in Dodge City, one in which I do not think it would be too difficult for him to receive a job.  With that door potentially open the only thing that might possibly lie in the way is ourselves.  Now, if in this case, I felt very strongly about our decision things would not be quite so untangible (if that is even a word).  Yet, I am struck with indifference.  The paralyzing side of an issue.  If, at least, my husband would state his side with such a tone I knew precisely what to do.  A simple step beside me is all I have received...if you really want this, it's yours.  Is what I feel everyone telling me.  What is it that I am so desperately reaching for?  Someone explain to me what it feels like to be content.  More importantly what it takes to feel/be content...satisfied.   Chris and I shared our opportunity with our small group this evening and asked for their prayer and proding.  On our way home Chris told me that this move would come with such a high price.  An unbalanced result...we give Tanya what she wants and we lose our community for it.  Now, I must interject that it is my desire to go.  The more we talked the more I realize much of my desire probably comes from a petty place when you consider the cost.  Frustration with our lives.  What am I so overcome by that it would encourage me to up an leave?  Our house and our city.  Patients is what he thinks I need...results is what I feel I need.  As I think about the course of things it continually comes back to all of this.  This one thing that drives me up the wall.  It  is  the one area that I do not feel content with, that places my life in disarray.  Tonight we talked about welfare.  What sticks out to me more than anything is how we feel we  need  to have this or that.  But we don't.  Simply stated.  There is nothing we need more than the basics (roof over our head, clothes on our back, food on our table).  We don't need all those shoes, all those tv's.  They are nice, but not necessary.  I am constantly striving for more, more, more.  Is the Dodge City Carrot more, more, more?  I believe I am coming to understand, as hard as it is to admit, that it indeed is.  "...he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind."  James 1:6

      Yet another song to describe the daily ins and outs of my life. :)  More to follow.  I had read your blog.  You talked to Brooke, eh?  Sounds good.  Sounds like Bethel ultimately turned out good...as a whole that is.  I'm glad you shared about the book you are reading.  Isn't it so tough to have things in mind for life, whether it be goals or dreams, and to think about having to let them go.  Not because they are bad within themselves, but perhaps because they have more of a hold on your life than God.  I know it is a totally selfish thing, but I've also come to realize just how selfish I am.  I do not say that lightly either.  If there is one major thing I learned from our counseling it would be a major revelation about my selfishness.  I've always known, but to what degree I was blind.  Yet, I see it reflected in all of my life...greed, the need for control, my time, my way.  What a long road it will place ahead.  To even conceive of giving some of those dreams up, is so difficult though.  No excuses, that are truly legitimate, can really be made.  They mostly root themselves in my selfishness.  I can't say this is true, per say, for you, but in some sense of where you are coming from I relate.  But, do you ever think we will ever overcome?  I mean honestly, generally speaking if it's not one thing then it is another.  You get one thing, but then there's always something else.  This nicely leads me to Dodge City...or life in general.  Primary things I want in life right now seem slightly ridiculous, but some how legitimate.  For instance, I'll give you a brief list: new house and a nice big backyard (fenced in, room to play, room to garden, room for a deck/patio...not that I have specifics or anything).  I guess you could say those are my two big things right now.  I get frustrated with our house because I don't think it is conducive to a lot of things.  Side note: Chris knows I feel this way.  I have loved our house and I definitely feel it has been a blessing and served us well for the time.  Now we have a kid though and we are consistently having large groups of people over.  In that sense, I don't feel like it is very good, or better stated-it's not how I want it...so greedy.  I want something more open and definitely more conducive to kids.  It feels like a nice house, but not home.  Besides the fact that I don't feel like we have room to grow.  So, I go to Dodge City and it's a descent town.  Ultimately it is a means to an end though.  More money, lower cost for housing, better schools...bingo we're set.  Is it best though?  Leaving my parents?  Leaving our church and friends?  (I must confess I feel that is replacable, perhaps because of our JW experience, but family you cannot replace)  It probably isn't best at all.  Family is way too important to me.  Plus, if we want to raise our kids to value that wouldn't we be sort of hypocritical, "well kids, family is truly important...but we were just going to make so much more money and our house was so much nicer that we just couldn't resist, but don't forget...family really is most important."  Uhh, no, that doesn't work.  So I give up or sacrifice.  Give up....Sacrifice....hmmm, both seem like sucky options.  Which leads to the next thing.  Chris emails me this:  Daytime nanny position available. Non-smoker for full-time employment caring for two infants in Overland Park home. Starting salary $550 weekly, beginning November 1, 2004. Employing family will pay for 50-hr work-week, to include holidays, vacation, and sick time plus federal and state withholding from salary. Qualified applicant needs own transportation, previous out-home experience caring for infant(s) and references able to be contacted. John Langaker, 913-620-4156.  Suddenly, I have a true choice to make on motives and desire.  It's all right here now.  We wouldn't have to move out of the city and it would essentially provide the same results.  So what's my true motive?  What am I willing to sacrifice or, do I have to give up for now?

      Should I stay or should I go now??  Dodge City? Tell me more....I posted recently on my blog, so you could hear how Bethel went. And it's tough to be back. I sort of have senioritis, but not full blown quite yet. I love being here, don't get me wrong, I couldn't imagine doing anything else. This place has been such a blessing to me, emotional health has sprung from the well here (at least for me) and I know that when I leave, I will be one of the few that understand what it means to be emotionally healthy and how that spiritual maturity depends on emotional health. It's going to be a long road, one in which I am going to get scared, cry, yell at God, yet know that he is walking/cradling me in the midst of all of this.  I'm currently reading "Shattered Dreams" by Larry Crabb and for me, it's such a blessing in hiding. I never want to surrender my dreams, because I feel like they are the best for me. Yet I have to believe that my dreams are only a glimpse of what God has dreamt for me. And these dreams are big one, like marriage and the security of a job, yet because I want them so much, I can't seem to let them go. And that isn't true...they do seem less of dreams when the truest dream I could want is to fall more in love with the Trinity.  Anyways, I don't know if this is where I am suppose to post, but I took a chance. And I hope this doesn't replace the phone calls...I would miss your voice dearly. Give my love to the family...

        It seems like it should be some sort of decision you can naturally break down, weigh the options and move forward. But of course, nothing is ever quite that simple in the Sanders' household. Since my trip to Dodge City we've been contemplating the move. Nothing can make you think harder than a huge carrot, pick your fancy, dangling in front of your face. It could be money, it could be a bigger house just the way you want it (the great kitchen, floors your kid can really crawl on, a great backyard), or maybe an extended Trailblazer in some beautiful color that shines just perfectly...or maybe it's simply the combination of the three thrown together. New opportunity, life improvement. A willing husband, a kid who doesn't know any difference, and a family you miss incredibly. To go or to stay? Will the answer ever fall in our laps? Doubtfully, but we can hope. A decision we'll be forced to arrive upon soon.
