      hi there.. i'd start to write another story about a young boy with his new born baby brother... he's family was so glad that their new baby have perfect health.. they all happily walked home that day.. days passed by and the baby grew.. after a month, the little baby got sick.. worried, his parents bought their baby to the hospital where the baby was born.. the doctor checked the baby for a few moments.. then after a time that felt like forever, the doctor blurted out the truth.. the baby had a very rare disease that kills its patients in days.. the only way to keep the baby alive is that to bring it in the intensive care unit and have a blood transfusion.. the baby is too young to have the operation and may cause him his death but the parents chose to do the operation.. the operation was successful, the baby did not die but he was losing strength.. the baby was weakening every moment.. the doctor told their family that they are still going to lose their baby and there is no more hope left.. the young boy, not knowing that his brother is already dying went to his father and told him, "i want to sing a song for my brother..". his dad bought him to his brother but the nurse said, "he is not allowed here sir, i'm sorry..". the young boy's dad got angry and without thinking, bought his son to their dying baby.. before the nurse could say anything, the young boy started to sing.. "good morning my baby, let me light up your life.. dont leave me be so i wont cry.." then, the baby lost his heartbeat.. at this moment, his parents cried but his brother still kept on singing.. "good morning my baby, let me light up your life.. dont leave me be so i wont cry.." suddenly, the baby gained back his heartbeat, his purple colored skin slowly turned back to normal.. everyone in the room got shocked and told the young boy that, "sing and continue to sing Micheal.. sing the beautiful song to your brother so that he may be happy.." at this moment, the baby has his skins color back to normal.. then the baby gained conciousness and started to cry..  we may think that a simple song may not make a person bring back his life but the prayer that comes with it is the reason of the miracle.. God is good and he will give you what you want if you just pray..

      ONE EARLY MORNING, A WOMAN, WHO  ALMOST EVERYONE KNEW AND LOVED, WENT TO HER  GRANDMOTHER'S FUNERAL...... THE WOMEN, NAMED ISABELLA, WAS  ABOUT TO BE MARRIED THE NEXT DAY. EVERY OTHER GUY WAS JEALOUS AND  SHE LOVED THE ATTENTION..... HER GRANDMOTHER LEFT ISABELLA A  CHEST WITH A LOT OF SO CALLED "JUNK" IN IT. SHE FOUND MANY CHAIN LETTERS,  INCLUDING THIS ONE, AND THOUGHT WHAT EVERYONE  ELSE THOUGHT ABOUT THEM: "BRIEFLY  ADOICANTUIOUSLLY MYTHS" .. SO.... WHAT DO U THINK HAPPENED..... THE GROOM CALLED THE WEDDING  OFF ........ SHE THOUGHT "OH WELL I HAVE EVERY  OTHER GUY...." WELL DID SHE?...... NO EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THE  PLANET DESPISED HER.....SHE WATCHED THE WORLD  AROUND HER CRIPPLE..... AND HER FAMILY DIED... :-( NOW WHAT SHE READ ON THE CHAIN  LETTER WAS THIS:   NOW YOU ARE SEEKED TO PASS THIS  ON. IT HAS BEEN PASSED ON 4 EVER, AND A PERSON WHO DOES NOT PASS  IT  ON SHALL HAVE A LOVE LIFE OF  COMPLETE  DEVER.  NOT ONLY NO A LOVE LIFE BUT  SICKNESS AND ILLNESS IN THE FAMILY. FOR YOU SHOULD THINK OF OTHERS  FIRST... BEFORE IT IS TO LATE!!!!!!!  NOW U GO TO FORWARD AT THE EDGE  OF YOUR SCREEN AND MAIL IT TO.... 10 PEOPLE ...AND WELL HERE LOOK AT  THIS:  IF U DO NOT PASS THIS ON AND TAKE IT  AS ANOTHER STUPID CHAIN LETTER THAN THE  FOLLOWING COULD HAPPEN...  1. THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE WILL BREAK  UP WITH U 4 NO REASON  2. A SPECIAL PERSON IN YOUR LIF E  WILL START SEEING SOMEONE ELSE AND LEAVE  U BE  3. YOUR LOVE LIFE WILL BREAK APART  AND NOT BE PUT TOGETHER IN AS MANY AS 4-5YEARS....

      (Dice)  Juz' call me first born, you're my first  love,  You're my 1st kiss from up above.  And I don't care if you don't give love  back  Coz' n my heart is where your ass is at.  I love your eyes , your nose & your tender  lips,  Wanna kiss your neck, your shoulders to  your finger tips.  I go crazy when you shake those sexy hips.  Baby girl you're the 1 I can't resist.  You know I love you from the very start, I  don't care if you break my heart.  I'm the man & I'm here for you, believe me  coz' my love is true.   CHORUS  (Sashi)  Itsumo kokoro we hoshi itstuka  Dare katu mata koi nei utchitimu  Itsumo kokoro nei eiro itsumo  Anata dake no basho ga aru kara   (K9)  You wanna get down with k-n-i-n-e, make  sure that's pure l-o-v-e  Never talk about the i-c-e coz' I only got  my h-e-a-r-t for y-o-u  I can't pay the bills for dinner, I juz'  give them my IOU  For sure, I'm not after f-u-c-k, got no b- a-d intentions don't wanna play girl,  Maybe we might spot a UFO, wait, that's  not part of the rhyme juz' felt like  sayin' so  You gotta know that I love from the start  till f-o-r-e-v-e-r.   Repeat chorus   (Dice)  Baby girl be my first lady, be the mom of  my first baby  You didn't like me when you first show me,  I'll be gentle I'll do it slowly.   (K9)  Girl, I think it's better if you was with  me, I got doe coz' I juz' won the spelling  bee  For you, I got all the t-i-m-e Ask mommies  to pass but I'm not so sure  Juz' doin' my on thing, shits more  expensive than your fancy gold rings,  I don't mean dissin' coz' I gots to go  there, mommies don't care,  All for them ladies, even chicks with nose  rings.   Repeat chorus twice

      Around the corner I have  a friend,  In this great city  that has no end,  Yet the days go by  and weeks rush on,  And before I know  it, a year is gone.  And I never see my  old friends face,  For life is a swift  and terrible race,  He knows I like him  just as well,  As in the days when  I rang his bell.  And he rang mine if,  we were younger then,  And now we are busy,  tired men.  Tired of playing a  foolish game,  Tired of trying to  make a name.  &quot;Tomorrow&quot; I say! &quot;I  will call on Jim  Just to show that  I'm thinking of him.  But tomorrow comes  and tomorrow goes,  And distance between  us grows and grows.  Around the corner!  yet miles away,  Here's a telegram,  Jim died today.&  And that's what we  get and deserve in the  end.  Around the corner, a  vanished friend.  Remember to always say what you mean.  If you love or like  someone, tell them.  Don't be afraid to express yourself. Reach out and  tell someone what they mean to you. Because  when  you decide that it  is the right time it might be too late.  Seize the day. Never have regrets. And most  importantly, stay  close to your friends and family, for they have  helped make you  the person that you are today.

      Love means...  a girl and guy were speeding over 100 mph on the  road...  Girl: Slow down. Im scared.  Guy: No this is fun.  Girl: No its not. Please, its too scary!  Guy: Then tell me u Love me.  Girl:Ok, I Love u. Slow down!  Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.  *Girl hugs him*  Guy: Can u take my helmet off & put it on? Its  buggin me.   In the paper the next day: A motorcycle had  crashed into a building because of break  failure.   2 ppl were on it but only 1 survived. The truth  was that halfway down the road, the guy realized  that his brakes broke, but he didn't want 2 let  the girl know. Instead, he had her say she Loved  him & felt her hug 1 last time, then had her  wear  his helmet so that she would live even though it  meant that he would die. Now if there is anyone on here that you love and  care for that much, say to him or her I love you and be sincere about it...
