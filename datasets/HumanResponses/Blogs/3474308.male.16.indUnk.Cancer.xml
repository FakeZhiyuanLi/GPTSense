      Today I walked all the way to a guitar shop and i bought a guitar string since my last one broke. I decided that I wanted to see a movie so I walked to blockbuster and payed  an overdue fee.Oops. Then I got got the crappiest movie ever (whitch im not gonna talk about).  After that was over I drew a pic of this awesome guy holding a staff of some sort. I whent to  go  play basketball afterwards and I hurt my retarded ankle. The pain was only temporary so im good.  Tomorrow I have to go to school for a measily PE class.    When you are arguing with a fool, make sure he isn't doing the same thing. -- Unknown

      a couple dayz ago i watched The Way Of The Gun, it was a pretty good film. Although it got a rating of like 1.75 out of 5.I guess its just because i like the horribly bad gunfights woth the good actors. Plus it was the first movie in whitch i seen Taye Diggs act like a complete jackhole. i give it a 3.5 out of 5.  anyway...i got to go pole vaulting today...loads of fun.I also acquired a huge nasty on my leg.sooner or later ill start playing with it.

      "Patience serves as a protection against wrongs as clothes do against cold. For if you put on more clothes as the cold increases, it will have no power to hurt you. So in like manner you must grow in patience when you meet with great wrongs, and they will then be powerless to vex your mind." --  Leonardo da Vinci  (1452 - 1519)

      what to say,      what to say? its been a while. i miss all my afterschool buddies. well its been pure work for me. everyday i get back home pooped, and to top it off im actually eating really healthy, which is good but i miss some of my favorite food.  Anyway, as some of you may know my brother is sick and it really sucks because my dad is all depressed and that usually makes me depressed.But my sis leaves everywhere and i really want to go but my dad asks me not to go and i stay for his sake.  other than that my life is just perky! :)  (not)  but ive improved on my guitar...woo hoo! and that would be the highlight of this whole blog. im gonna go and do absolutely nothing while my sis bathes in the sun at Zuma beach. *knocks himself out*
