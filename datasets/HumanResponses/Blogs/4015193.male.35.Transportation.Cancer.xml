      I have something that worries more than the fact that "The Shrub(tm)" may be re-elected. My ATM is down.  Due to my unending loyalty, I've stayed with my small little credit union based in San Francisco. It really is the best of all worlds. They are not tied into the normal net, so it takes an extra 3-5 days for transactions to post to my account and they all know me and my account by the sound of my voice when I call. They ask me about Chicago everytime I call to check on something or order new checks.  The problem is that my current employer does not offer direct deposit on my weekly paycheck so I need to visit an ATM, or drop it into the mail and wait 3-5 days for it to move via the most trustworthy service in the world, the US Postal Service, thus undoing the previous benefit of having my 3-5 day lag.  There are exactly two ATM's in the entire Chicago area that accept deposits to my account (through some agreement with my credit union). One of them is in Rosemont (Suburb of Chicago) and the other is on the 7th floor of Marshall Field's State Street Flagship store. The past two weeks, the ATM in Rosemont has been "out of order". Today, the ATM was actually GONE!  So, I plugged my headphones into my iPod and headed towards the "El" to go down to the Loop and deposit my check. To get to and from the ATM, I walk right through the Men's department, the Houswares department, the Kitchen department, and the bedding department. These are all very dangerous places for me to be right now. I am trying very hard to be good, but last week, I bought 4 t-shirts and a tank top, and today, I got a fantastic deal on 2 pair of Kenneth Cole dress pants (38 x 34 and flat front).  I hope they get my ATM repaired quickly...

      Today was a communications nightmare for me.  Sprint PCS has this very nasty way of treating its customers. They give you a pre-set spending limit and then the day that your bill is printed, if you go over that limit, they shut off your phone with the news coming via the means of a text message.  I don't normally complain about bills and such, but when did the concept of Net-30 Day payment terms mean shutting off service the day your bill is printed? This is the second time this has happened to me. This first time also co-incided with a change in my usage plan.  Sprint also has this habit of not allowing you to know how many minutes you have used for the entire month that you are in a new plan. I was trying to be more thrifty a few months back and explored my usage finding that I was paying for 1400 minutes a month, but only using on average 700. So I dropped my plan to 1100 minutes to save $20.00 a month. That cost me an extra $120.00 for the first month. Realizing I'd made a mistake I put it back, costing me only $89.73.  On top of my Sprint nightmare, my local phone monopoly, SBC Communications, came out to fix the static on my line and decided the line needed to be turned off all day to do that, leaving me without communications for the majority of the day.  This wouldn't necessarily be a problem, but I work from home alot and need all the communications options I can get.  Thank GOD my Cable internet wasn't down so I could still look at my porn. I don't know what I would do without that!!!   In a different direction, I think it may be time for me to find a benefactor. Not a Sugar Daddy, cause they would expect you to have sex with them. I just want someone to pay my bills. Sure, I'll be nice to them while they hand me a check, I'd even polish a shoe here or there if the checks were big enough.  I'm going to go for a walk down to the beach and watch the sunset over the city. Its been way too long since I've spent time on the lakefront.

      Wow!  I watched the Democratic Convention tonight and was totally blown away by Barak Obama's speach. I can honestly say that for the first time in 3 years I feel Hope towards a brighter future. I was in tears of relief at the end of his speach. I had shivers of excitement cursing thru me as I sat there and listened to him tell me about the bright future he saw and the good things this country can still accomplish.  It was such a relief to hear something hopeful after 3 years of fear-mongering and lies. Whether "The Shrub" lied or not is not even the point to this post. The very nature of all notices from the White House the past three years have been negative and fear filled. Another attack likely. Another rogue nation building "nukular" weapons of Mass destruction.  I'm so tired of being afraid. Its nice to hear someone hopeful. Its nice to hear a different message. I would vote for Obama for President after THAT speach alone.  On another note...  I've been at this blog less than a week, and with no training at all, I find myself re-writing the html code to improve my site. I'm very excited about this as this has been something that a few days ago seemed about as possible as positive messages coming from White House. And yet, here it is. I've added links and a quote that I stumbled across someplace on the web.  Oh yeah, and I found urlLink  this  too.. Not sure if its real or fake, but its funny, in a completely Politically-Incorrect manner.  Thanks to my friend at the Sardonic-Bomb that encouraged me to start this.  Its late so this will be a short entry. I've been up playing with html code for hours... fun fun fun...

      The introduction: ( I wrote this a few weeks ago)  I have a well-earned respect for drug addicts. I myself had been a regular drug user during my 20's, and it was during this time that life took on a strange context of normalness and sanity. Looking back upon those days however, I'm careful to realize that the majority of my experiences were drug-ridden flights of fancy that had very little basis in reality. The memories I have of those days are filled with inaccuracies and perhaps downright lies, but I still tell the stories and I still relive the memories both real and imagined as if they were irrefutably proven hard facts.  My decent into the decadence of the underground drug culture began innocently enough in an alleyway in San Francisco's SOMA neighborhood as I crawled out of my 1978 Honda Civic. The car was a perfect extension of my personality with its duct tape racing stripes precisely applied to cover the rust spots on the roof, but appearing to give the offset appearance of the European racing cars of the 1960's. The ample rust taking over the rear hatch had been covered with the remnants of a stack of stolen bumper stickers from an Army/Navy surplus store in St. Louis. The hatch screamed out “Hullabaloo” in bright orange and yellow.  It was from this car that I was crawling when she walked up to me and changed my life forever. Her name was “Concha” and she was a child of the night. An ample girl of at least 300 pounds, yet standing only 5'8” tall, she was covered in a lace moo moo styled dress obviously purchased from a second hand store due to the aging and yellowing yarn crochet work not seen since the late 70's. She had a small ring thru her nostril and was waving an unlit cigarette in my direction asking for a light. Not having a book of matches I suggested the cigarette lighter in my car and off we went back to the car to help her get her nicotine fix. Once we had her cigarette lit, she firmly took hold of my arm and said in her unique and completely flattering way “You're adorable, come with me you have to meet my friends”. When Concha would speak, she spoke with an earnestness that was not questioned for she believed her words with complete conviction.  The rest of that night became a blur of bright lights, hours on the dance floor and an endless number of trips to the special VIP lounge on the upper floor of the nightclub. The VIP lounge was located upstairs towards the front of the club and was guarded by a serious looking drag queen/club kid and the ubiquitous velvet rope. Concha was well known and just a nod of her head and the rope was pulled aside and we were whisked into the confines of the inner sanctum.  This new world fascinated and enraptured me. Once inside the lounge she continued her tight grip on my arm and dragged me towards the VIP lounge restroom, a small room off to the side with just a small sink and toilet. Once we were inside she said “Meet Chrissie” and handed me the little plastic pouch full of a white powdery substance that would be both my devil and my savior for the next few years. Speed, Crystal, Chrissie, the names were not important but that white powder did an amazing thing to me as it burned its way into my brain via the lining of my nasal passages. Time melted away along with any insecurity I had been hanging on to. I was a beautiful boy, full of life and wit. I had enough energy to talk all night long, and that is exactly what I did for in another area of the VIP lounge there was a fireplace with beanbags strewn around on the floor in front of it. Concha and I had conversations of such depth and importance that we'd missed the fact that the sun had risen and the music had stopped. People had joined us for brief moments of an hour or two, until they would wander away to dance or further enhance their own chemically altered existences.  The people I met that night were unlike any I'd ever seen in my life before. Colors and clothes I didn't think possible were on display for all to see with each person attempting to show themselves as more “fabulous” than anyone else. This was not just people dressing outlandishly for their own fun, this was a downright competition and the losers would swear to beat them the following weekend, often spending hours hunched over sewing machines and picking thru thrift stores for an idea or two they could latch onto to outshine everyone else. They had club kid names like “Richie Rich” and “Robnoxious”, and were people I would soon call friends as I too would merely nod at the VIP Lounge guard and the rope would be pulled aside for me.

      I have alot going on in my life all the time.  In my mind, I long for a time when I can sit in the sun on a rocking chair and read while sipping iced tea or homemade lemonade. I relish memories of a long ago time that I've never even experienced. A simpler time when you could trust the people around you, and leave your doors unlocked. Where you know your neighbors and they look after your place while you're traveling, mowing the lawn and collecting the mail so that your place looks inhabited. This is the kind of place I come from, where you know your neighbors, you may not like them, but you know that if you truly needed help, they'd be there without question.  When I graduated college, I chose to move as far away from my family as I could. I ended up in San Francisco, CA. I briefly considered moving to Japan, cause it was even farther away, but my lack of interest in Asian men kept me from making that leap. Settling in San Francisco was a major culture shock and one that took many years to adjust to. I was less educated, less affluent, and less experienced than most people that I met. I was the little town boy that landed in the large city and hoped to fit in. I lived in SF for over 11 years and I never truly felt at home. Oh, I loved the Bay Area and still call it home though I've been in Chicago for over 3 years now. But to really feel at home is something that I've never really been able to master. Growing up gay in small town America, I longed for the life in a big city where there were other people like me. Once I made it to big city life, I missed the slower pace and simpler life of the small town. I've never really felt like I fit in.  Where is this all going? I don't really know. So I'll go on to the subject that the entry is titled...  I'm going camping with my family. I'm hoping that I can make it thru the experience without reverting to the feelings I had when I was twelve.  So I guess, I'm standing on the threshold of hope. Hope that my family will one day (meaning very very soon) come to accept me and my life and my loves without judgment, without fear, and embrace me for who and what I am.  But my biggest fear is that they will continue to be exactly like they are and make their attempts to force me into the roll that they feel comfortable with.

      My friend called me today complaining about the fact that the price of his Diet Coke has gone up as fast as gasoline. He's now paying $1.44 per 20oz bottle.  He asked why. I told him that this too, could be blamed on "the shrub(tm)". He didn't follow. go back to the source I told him.  OIL. Oil is the basis of plastic. Oil is used in the containers to transport the syrup to the bottling plants. Oil is used in the bottles, the caps, the plastic labels, the plastic transport crates. It all comes down to OIL.  Oil is so heavily involved in our everyday life, even if you do not own a vehicle that burns gas, that most people do not realize it. The computer I'm typing on, though it may be a cute yet fabulous little iBook, is made with oil. Petrochemicals are just as bad as gasoline for the environment.  This brought up a question. Today, I read in the paper that oil prices are surging again because of the continued violence in Iraq and the threat that it may disrupt the Iraqi oil production levels.  Why would this effect oil prices, when less than a year ago, Iraqi oil wasn't even allowed on the market due to our embargo? Shouldn't all of Iraq's oil production be considered a new source and thereby ease oil prices?  When are we going to stand up and demand reasonable answers from our leaders instead of sitting back and watching the oil companies rake in record profit after record profit year in and year out?  this rant is finished... or is it?

      I was talking on the phone with a friend of mine in LA a few minutes ago and he uttered a surprisingly pertinent question.  "Is it a metaphor that Victory Avenue in Los Angeles is closed?"  This is as good a point as any to start my post today. Sorry for not writing yesterday, but I've been pre-occupied with a job interview. I'm frustrated with the state of things in my life. A little under a year ago, I took a pretty hefty pay cut to get out of a bad work situation, only to throw myself into a bad economic situation with another bad work situation rapidly approaching.  It doesn't look good for me. But I still have time to turn things around.  My job is not easy. Most people probably think that sales people are slimy, gold chain wearing used car hawkers. And to be honest, in my industry, most still can be classified as such; but I’d like to think I’m above that. Problem is, most people I come into contact with don’t give me a chance to prove it.  The bulk of my job has to do with cold-calls, telephone or in-person visits to solicit business. Not easy when you work for a small relatively unknown company. I believe in the product I’m pushing, but having a hard time believing in myself lately. This is probably in direct relation to the amount of money I’m making. I’m not making enough to live comfortably, but the money is there to be made. So it’s a bit of a mind-fuck. The harder I work, the more chances to make more money. But I’m struggling so its hard to have enough faith in myself to do the job I’m being paid to do.  I have brief moments where I shine, but they are very brief and there is a wide gap between them. To tie this into the question posed above…  How do you get to drive on victory avenue if its closed?  Do I stay in an industry that I am familiar with, but not all that interested in, or do I try my hand at something new knowing it would be starting over in everything (including pay scale)?

      How do you know its the right time to let go of the past and move forward? I've lived in Chicago for almost 3 and a half years now but I just realized, while talking on the telephone with a friend from the Bay area, that I've never really said goodbye to California and embraced my life here in Chicago.  I often find myself reminiscing with people about times gone by. The company Christmas party where KK came out with her man and we turned everything upside down. The things I did to egg on the man that would, in turn, fire me from my job and give me an unwanted (and unpaid) 3 month long vacation. The trip to Amsterdam to replace the bottle of poppers seized by U.S. Customs. These milestones are revisited again and again, and retold with energy and reverence that my present life does not hold.  When living in the past is happier than the present, how do you stop and refocus forward? How do you embrace a place and a way of life that feels temporary and unwanted? How do you let go of the bright lights of your past and look at lighting new, brighter lights in your future?  Answers anyone?

      The weekend is over and the workweek resumes.  Quite a weekend for me. Double D took me to a "Spa" for the weekend, at least, that was the plan. The reality was a whole different story.  We arrived at " urlLink The Pheasant Run Resort " in the far west suburbs of Chicago around 9am. He checked into his seminar and I tried to check into the room. Wasn't quite that easy since Expedia never booked the room with the hotel so they had to find us a place.   *Warning to everyone, if you use Expedia, double check directly with the airline/hotel/car rental company before you leave on your trip.*   They would have a room for me by noon, so I headed to the quaint little downtown area and poked around the antique and junk shops that lined the street. In one shop, I stumbled across a series of books put out by Time-Life in the 1970's. I had all of the books in the series except one. Do you know how much of a mind fuck it is when you see every single book that you have and get excited that maybe, just maybe, you'll be able to complete your set. They didn't have the book I was missing. They too had the rest of the series but were, alas, missing the much sought out volume.  Having my hope quashed, I headed back to the hotel to check in. They found us a room, and in the new (luxury) wing. After getting to the room, I realized that this room had double beds and not the king sized we were asking for. (How can you have "mad hotel monkey sex(tm)" in a double bed?)  I'll save the details of the 7 trips to the front desk just trying to get a room. Finally at 4:00pm (eight hours after beginning "the quest for a room") they handed me the key cards. The room was a dump no better than a Motel. In fact, I think it was a motel that was enclosed due to the fact that all rooms had A/C units facing into the hallway and the hallway had A/C units trying to fight the heat in the hall. It was the hallway of battling A/C units.  The weekend wasn't all bad. I had an AMAZING hot stone massage at the  urlLink Marco Tricoci salon and day spa  and I spent some wonderful moments hanging out with Double D. We travel well together I think. I'll let him comment on that (if he so chooses).  Being without a place to go for eight hours taught me something important. I could  never  be homeless. I was out of my friggin mind just trying to find a place to sit and read the books I brought. I gave up on the hopes of Wi-Fi access as soon as we exited the highway so that was out of the question. So today, as the work week begins, I have a renewed sense of vigor in my job. I have new focus. I am dedicated and driven. Well, I will be as soon as I get back from Krispy Keme. This coupon expires soon and I want a doughnut.

      crazy Item #1 - late night drunken bootie calls. I think that's enough said!  Crazy Item #2 - Rogue Personal Trainers. I love to sit at the gym (between sets) and watch all the personal trainers put their clients thru their paces. It amazes me how each trainer has a unique way of doing the exact same thing. It makes me wonder why with thousands of years of physical fitness material available (Hot ancient Greeks to present day muscle queens) there isn't some standardized method of getting a body in shape. Today, I saw a trainer put her victim on the treadmill to walk  backwards.  Please tell me what that will do.  Crazy Item #3 - speed freaks at the gym. you're already thin. Bitch  Crazy Item#4 - this is really just my own paranoia, but are Pizza Rolls(tm) healthy breakfast foods?  Off to shower

      In response to  urlLink Hot Toddy's  post today, I wanted to share something that I wrote l about my treadmill experience... Is is wrong to recycle Blog entries?   Terror on the treadmill – 12/10/2002  I know it has been a while since I’ve last written and I apologize. I have found a new vigor in life, love and yes, even in work. I have gotten to a point where life is rolling along again. I’m even better about going to the gym. I feel so good after a nice hard workout. This is actually where I need to begin my story… I usually wait until after 7:00pm to go to the gym. This allows for the after-work rush to process through and I get the tail end of it. (affording me the benefits of the show without the headaches of waiting for a machine) Last night, I arrived at the gym, bag slung over my shoulder, headphones affixed to the ears, ready to sweat to some Disco. I proceeded to the gym to change into my workout gear and new sneakers. After changing, I headed to the second floor where the cardio is located, well actually where the bulk of the gym is located. And to my amazing eyes, every single piece of cardio equipment was occupied except … The TREADMILL. Now I have never been on a treadmill before. I’ve played with one at the stores, but never really used it to exercise. I jumped on the only piece of cardio equipment available and pretended that I knew what I was doing and I had no doubts about how to operate this thing. That was my first mistake. Or no, my first mistake was to do this while the latest dance song was pounding into my headphones. I pushed a few buttons and the damn thing started lurching towards the sky. “Oh!” ,I remarked, “That must be what the incline button does.” I adjusted the incline to feel like I was back home in good ‘ol San Francisco and I was climbing away towards Twin Peaks. Next came the speed request from the little computer running the show. “hmmmm” how fast do I walk? I’ve never timed myself. Lets say 5mph that seems reasonable enough. The belt started moving and I jumped on and started walking. Or run/walking as the case may be. I adjusted the speed down to 3.5mph which was MUCH more doable for me. It’s the funniest feeling walking on a treadmill when you are 6’4” tall. I’m used to walking, I’ve been doing it most of my life, but when I was walking on this thing, I felt nauseous. I felt like there was something not right in the world. I had a constant fear the entire time I was on that damn contraption, that I would glance at a hot man walking by, put a foot ever so slightly out of place and have the belt whisk it out from under me taking my body with it sending me careening to the belt whirling beneath me, where I would then be moved at great velocity into the machine directly behind me with a thud so loud the entire gym would gather around at the dork laying mangled in yet another tragic treadmill accident. These things happen. I know they do. So I walked, holding onto the side rails for life, my gaze fixed squarely on a specific point directly in front of the machine. Concentrating on that spot, I walked, and as I walked, I got more and more comfortable, until I picked up a bit of a jaunt to my step. I was swinging my arms, I was getting into this new machine driven sidewalk. Then the worse thing that could ever happen happened. The machine started beeping at me, telling me that my pre-set time was about to expire. This filled me with dread. I knew the machine would stop, but would I be able to? The machine started to slowdown, eventually coming to a stop. My head was telling me that the machine was still moving, and to keep walking. It was about 5 minutes before I could walk a straight line again without feeling dizzy. Needless to say, I won’t be running on one of those things anytime soon!

      Let the games begin!  I'm excited about the summer games starting this weekend. I won't watch them, but it would be cool to have another major terror attack be caught on film to shock and awe the world. Oh wait, I'm sorry, "shock and awe" have already been used by the U.S. Regime currently in power. Just so you know, I popped a bag of popcorn and was glued to the TV for both the Loma Prieta Earthquake in California and the World Trade Center attacks. Television is entertainment after all. Don't get all pissed off about the death of innocent people, I'm callous, not hateful.  No, what I'm talking about is the kick off of the Grecco-Roman wrestling matches taking place in my upstairs neighbor's apartment. I was only happy to lay in bed until 3am and wonder in awe about how 2 relatively small people could manage to make that much noise. It wasn't sex, I was listening for the groans. It wasn't a fight like I secretly hoped (an affinity for overhearing arguments learned in the prime of my childhood due to the rarity of occurrence in my household). So the only thing I could come up with was that they were competing in the Grecco-Roman wrestling competitions.   I am curious as to the outcome and who won? Being the shit-starter that I am so proud to be, I'm sure I'll ask them next time I see them during daylight hours.  I'm off, need to change the Cher CD-single that I started listening to at 6am right before I hit the gym.

      I whipped myself into a panic attack today. Its very difficult for me to accomplish this feat and when I do and it has passed, I’m often very impressed with the intensity of my own mind-fuck.  I sat at my computer and convinced myself that I would soon be out of a job and thereby out on the street turning tricks for food and a chance to plug into the net and upload my blog. I imagined myself hanging out in the public library reading blogs all day to pass the time until I needed to head back to the shelter and fight for a bunk to sleep in. On the plus side, I’d be fabulously thin because most homeless people are. C’MON! I’m sure I’m not the only one that has whispered under my breath “thin bitch” as a sinewy man walks by in clothes obviously from a better time.   All of this because within 2 months I’ll have been at my job for a year and I haven’t met my sales numbers yet.  Of course there is more to it than this. I have half a mind to place some scrutiny onto Miss Cleo’s reading yesterday. She’s the one that whipped up my imagination into the grand “walk-a-bout(tm)”. But ultimately, I need to reflect upon my own actions over the past 10-20 years.  You see, if I truly want to get to the bottom of things, I need to look back to high school when I was offered a chance to skip ahead a year in Math. My parents were dead set against it. This was just another notch in the belt of defeat they’d manage to wrap around my heart while growing up.  Their lack of faith in my abilities, and lack of support for my dreams managed to take the wind out of my sails in ways I’d never comprehend until just recently.   Of course, I failed miserably at Math. Not right away, in fact, I excelled for a few years until I hit Calculus. Due to my failure in math, my dream career of being a Navel Architect (yeah designing ships) was no longer an option and I never had a second option in the wings to fall back on.  Thank god for the whole alumni college acceptance policy or I’d never have gone to college. I humbly accepted the offer from my father’s alma matter and entered college in the innocuous transportation field.  Its in this capacity that I’ve languished for the past 15 years.  I agreed to this field thinking maybe I could be a male version of Julie McCoy, (Welcome aboard. Your room is on the Lido deck, thru those doors and down 3 flights. enjoy your cruise). I fantasized about that clipboard when I signed on to this college fiasco.  But!!! I do have a degree. and I thank my parents for that.  But today, I was sitting here panicked because I’ve been in an industry that is decidedly blue-collar and anything but glamourous. I have very little contact with anything creative and have no passion in my job. And when you’re in sales, that comes across, so I feel like I’m in this self-defeating cycle that is tightening around my neck.    My last job was hell so I took a considerable pay cut to leave and now I’m struggling financially, this affects my self-worth, which affects my ability to be positive and upbeat and secure enough to hit up strangers for business. All this, in turn, makes it hard to get new business and meet my numbers, which perpetuates my situation.  ya know what... lets just blame Miss Cleo.  I’m gonna go back and read some blogs and pretend that I'm thin.

      I have had the strangest day.  Waking up in a strange bed usually doesn't throw me the way it has today, but for some reason, I just feel a little bit off. I woke up feeling groggy and stiff and forced myself into 25 minutes of cardio at the gym. (cute new Doctor thinks I'm fat) I was shooting for 30 minutes, but after 25, I was bored and my right foot was just a tad bit numb, so I called it quits and headed home.  Nothing of consequence happened until I started to get dressed for work at like 1:30pm. As I was standing there in my Ted Baker suit, trying to decide upon which tie would best bring out the blue stripes in the H&M dress shirt, my fingers floated across a tie I picked up on my travels to Kyoto, Japan. Its a very simple tie done in dark blue with a very famous Buddhist prayer in white Kanji script. My favorite tie. I chose this tie and took a moment to remember when I bought it.   I was in Kyoto on my own. At the time, I had an amazing boss who allowed me two weeks in Asia on a business meeting. While I was there, I phoned home and added a week in Japan for vacation since I was already there. She told me to contact the office in Kyoto and she'd allow me to expense the whole damn week. I was only too happy to oblige her request.  So this morning as I was tying my tie, I thought back to that trip and how happy I was to be traveling, and seeing the world and I said to myself that I wish I had an opportunity to travel again.  Fastforward to the arduous commute home. I called Double D's friend Miss Cleo to take her up on her offer of a psychic reading. We talked for over an hour and a quarter while I maneuvered my way home thru the crush of traffic and stop-lights. She brought up some very good points and made some very dead on observations. But the thing that caught my fancy more than anything else was her mention of a "walk-a-bout(tm)". She told me that within a year, I'd be leaving Chicago to go on a world-wide trip. I'd finally get a chance to see the world and better yet, I'd be given an opportunity to share my truly unique view of things with others.  So now that Miss Cleo has spoken... the task is mine to take upon...

      I don't know what to think anymore when it comes to Politics. On the one hand, we have the ever smirking Shrub(tm) who looks like he got stuck in some half-brained college prank that he cannot extricate himself from; while on the other hand, we have a supposedly liberal, intellectual war hero that has no real personality and isn't very clear about his stand on many items that are dear to me.  Until now.  I read in  urlLink this article  today that the two Johns gave  no objection  to the recent ruling in Missouri banning marriage rights for  urlLink my peoples . Now, and I've said this before, I'm not exactly a person that has thought long and hard about getting married. I've never dreamt that I would find a man, fall in love, move to the suburbs to an oversized house that sits 4 inches from my neighbor's equally oversized dwelling. I never thought about these things because I knew that it wasn't an option. But shouldn't it be my decision? Should the government tell me who I am allowed to do that with?  My whole problem with the Gay marriage bans that are going around is the defense term. What are you defending? Marriage? or is it that you are defending your tax breaks, your way of life, your stability, your ideas?  Well lets take a looky-loo at this shall we?  Marriage is a religious ceremony more than anything else. Marriage is a step taken when two people love each other enough to stand up in front of their family and the world, and oh yes God, and announce to everyone that you love this person and wish to spend the rest of your life together. Some prefer the regal  urlLink churches  and synagogue, while others, like  urlLink Brittany , prefer  urlLink the little white wedding chapel  in Las Vegas. Marriage provides a basis of support both legal and emotional. Marriage tells the world and each other, that this is something serious not just a trick that didn't go away (I've had a few of those).  When my siblings all were married, they had to go to the Doctor and get the blood tests done, next they had to go to city hall to get the marriage license, and lastly, they had to go to the church to have the ceremony.  Now, given that little document called the U.S. Constitution has a statement about "separation of Church and State", you'd think this was a no brain-er. Marriage is a religious ceremony. Priests and Rabbis are given the power to sign the marriage certificate. Why? Doesn't this constitute religion within the state?  I suggest this. Every couple, male-female, female-female, and male-male be allowed to do the first 2 steps. Get the blood tests, get the marriage license. This allows every couple the legal protections and requirements of a civil union. Take the religion out of it. If you want to go to the 3rd step, they by all means, go, have your ceremony and I wish you the best for your future.  But DO NOT limit MY RIGHTS to spousal support, palimony, equal distribution of assets and inheritance rights!!!!  Take religion out of our politics like the French have. There are way too many religions floating around this country to fair and equal to each.  phew... sorry about that little rant, I'm not sure what came over me.  back to my point...  Who the hell do I vote for? They all seem like first class fuck-ups who will lie, distort and do whatever it takes to make it to the white house.  Lets rename it to "The House of Shame(tm)" and see if the drive to get there is still as strong cause lets face it, this country is in one fucked up place.

      i am faced with a dilemma brought on  by many years of poor planning.  I have been working for my current employer for about 9 months now and being in sales, i am expected to bring a certain level of new business/profits to the company. I took a rather substantial pay-cut to join this company (more to escape my last employer than anything else) and have tightened my proverbial belt to within an inch of its usefulness.  I am poor. Well, not living in a hovel in India with 25 relatives and a cow/God poor, but I'm poor compared to what I'm used to. This week, being the first week of a new month, my sales reports/figures were generated for last month.  I was 25% better last month than I am this month. They don't look good.  Then, in what I am sure MUST be a sign from God, I started to get Recruiters calling. First Monday i received an e-mail with a job opening, then this morning I received a telephone call from a very accomplished recruiter. She told me the details and I must admit I'm intrigued.  The dilemma I'm faced with is probably a no brainer for most, but for me there is a certain level of loyalty that I have for a company that saves me from the hellish existence I was living.  Do I leave my current employer and add yet another company to my increasingly long resume list?   OR  Do I stick it out, suffer thru with my miserable salary and hope that I meet my numbers soon so that I can get commission?  i have a feeling this will consume my weekend.  I know...I'll have a martini... That ALWAYS helps me relax and get to the meat of the matter.

      A little update on my porn situation. Still wet. I think the torrential downpour washed away any   scratch-n-sniff   capabilities, but we'll have to wait a few more days to confirm.  Last night after the gym, I stopped off to a relatively new Sushi place in the neighborhood. Words of warning to any restauraneur that waits on  The Brat (tm)... "When I ask for the check, BRING IT TO ME!" Don't make me wait ten minutes to ask a second time, and definitely DO NOT make me walk it to you after another 10 minutes have passed. I rounded off the bill with a whopping $5.45 tip on a $54.55 tab. I think I over-tipped.  I'm off to the Doctor today. I doubt I'll get a butt exam, but I've "freshened up" just in case. I'm a bit on the nervous side this morning because my brother finds out what's going to happen to him today as well. hmmmmm. Ass Cancer. It sounds funny when you say it, but it doesn't quite feel funny when its your 36 year old brother. I really hope I didn't wish this on him when I was 5 and he was pounding the living daylights out of me.

      What are they so damn afraid of?  I'm writing, of course, about the constant hateful focus of the Religious Right onto anybody that is different from themselves. Today, Missouri added fear and hate into their state constitution by approving a gay marriage ban. Personally, I'm on the fence about marriage for myself, but I think that I should at least have the option should I want to utilize it. They join Alaska, Hawaii, Nebraska and Nevada in telling me that they do not want me in their midst.  I'm now waiting for Louisiana, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Montana, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, Michigan, North Dakota and Ohio to finalize their fearful marches against us.  I realize that while I attended public school and my education is second rate, I'm pretty confident that somewhere along the line I heard the words,  ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL . Where, in the founding documents of our country does it single me out and say,  "EXCEPT for Wade cause he's a big friggin FAG !" ?  Each day, our sane neighbors to the north seem more and more welcoming to me. Some days, like today, the hateful policies of Saudi Arabia seem more welcoming than my own homeland. At least in Saudi Arabia, I know that they'll kill me for being gay. Here, they'll smile to my face, tell me that they hate my "sin", but that they love me.  Call a spade a spade.  You hate gay people that's why you write laws against us. Don't hide behind your Religion and tell me that you are trying to save the sanctity of marriage. If you are truly trying to save the "sanctity" of marriage then stone Brittany Spears, stone J.Lo., stone the twice married John Kerry. But leave me the fuck alone and let me love who I love.    on a lighter note... (cause I'm sure you need one)  If you're ever in Portland Oregon, be sure to check out... "Mini-KISS, one of many troupes of KISS imitators."..."they get more attention because they're midgets! In a flip-flop of the KISS image (larger than life shoes, shoulders, tongues, and libidos), Mini-KISS is bringing houses down with their miniature version of the glam monsters. Eerily, Mini-KISS bear an uncanny facial resemblance to the objects of their spoof, and it's not just the makeup... maybe someone just finally cut Gene Simmons down to size."    urlLink    Mini-KISS&nbsp; urlLink

      A truly sad day for me. Shortly after my return from the gym, there was a sudden downpour. Alas, years of collecting and tens of dollars of investment are gone. My porn suffered the downpour poorly. It now sits on the porch in a soggy puddle of ink.  I shall try to dry it as best I can. I may have to cancel all my weekend plans to iron my porn back to its original state.  I may be the first person to have  scratch and sniff  porn.  I stumbled accross this little  urlLink  blog entry   earlier today, and I think it sums up my beliefs on marriage very nicely.

      It started with the sound of breaking glass and a barking dog. I thought, "oh shit! the dog knocked over a picture frame in my roommates living room and I need to clean up the glass."  Not exactly.  After thoroughly searching the house for broken glass, and checking the back deck I started to smell something familiar in the air. Yep, Poppers! I realized that I hadn't  accessed  this item within the last hour or two and rushed to my nightstand and the overpowering "aroma" confirmed my fear. A bottle of my premium grade poppers, procured at the annual  urlLink International Mr Leather conference  had exploded inside my nightstand. I ran to the window and threw it open, closed the bedroom door and turned on the overhead fan to get as much air moving as possible without allowing it to seep into the rest of the house and thereby affect the two innocent dogs that I live with. This was not good timing. I was due at the gym to meet my workout partner in five minutes.  Now, in my nightstand are the carefully chosen contents needed for any and all stimulatory activities both solo and multi-partnered. I carefully extracted the items one by one shaking off the tiny glass particles and separating said items based upon washable or non washable, which for the most part went directly into the trash. Gone are my blindfold, the exploded bottle of poppers and out of fear of a repeat, the remaining bottle(s) of opened poppers.  Also contained in my nightstand was a sampling of my written porn collection (procured over time from  urlLink http://www.nifty.org/ , lovingly printed and professionally bound). Today the sample was a stack of at least 3 inches tall. I briefly toyed with the idea of discarding this stack but thought better of it and simply discarded the upper most story (title noted first so that it could be reproduced and replaced into the sample) due to the glass shards sticking to it. As it turns out, this sampling of printed porn saved my day by soaking up the entire liquid contents of the little brown bottle. The stack now resides discretely on a wicker shelf on the back porch.  I should warn my roommate not to read it... She might not look at me in quite the same frame of reference again.  Once all was cleaned, vacuumed, hosed off, thrown away, and finally restocked into the nightstand, I proceeded to the gym to work out.  I was half way to the gym before the familiar "wah" "wah" of the poppers left me.

      I like men with hairy chests and big dicks. What can I say? Its just what makes me happy. My new boyfriend, whom I'll call "Double D" is missing one of the pre-requisite items I just mentioned. So, to correct that problem, I went to a fabric store, and searched the aisles of patterns and prints until I came upon the fake fur section. The swatch I ended up buying even matches his complexion quite nicely.  What? there are some things I just cannot do without!!!  It is Monday morning and I'm not feeling like working today. I wish somebody would pay me to look at internet porn and play in chat rooms all day. But alas, I must focus and work this afternoon if I am to keep my job, such as it is.  Lastly, and most importantly, my big brother has been diagnosed with cancer. They found a tumor in his ass about 7 inches long. He doesn't know yet how bad it is, but he will find out on Thursday when he goes for his consultation. He will probably have chemo, then surgery, then chemo again. He's taking it very well, but my Mother is not. His attitude has been, "well, there's nothing I can do about it so why worry".  My Mom on the other hand has been running around calling everyone warning them to get checked for something similar.  Mine is scheduled for Thursday.  I hope its just a coincidence and not a sign.

      In the middle of a night full of strange dreams and continual tossing and turning, I woke up my new boyfriend. It seems that I had stolen the sheet and he jerked it back, rousing me from my dream. Apparently I said, "I'm having the strangest dreams tonight. I just dreamt of a cartoon monkey with real people in it too." I have to take him for his word at this, because I don't remember ANY of this; stealing the blanket, rousing from sleep, or uttering those words, none of it, nothing. I usually don't remember my dreams and I rarely will admit to the fact that I speak during closed-eye hours. There have been times that stand out in my mind, but they are rare and far between, meaning, the people that will tell me what I've said are rare and far between.  Some of the times I remember my dreams, I wish they would linger long enough for me to write them down in exactly detail. If I were able to record any one of these times, I'd be a wealthy screenwriter. I'm telling you, "The Governator(TM)" would have nothing on my stories. Full of action and mayhem, my dreams would put his block-buster summer fare to shame. Unfortunately, as I lolly-gag in my half awake state, the story boards of these dreams dissipate from my head like the sleep from my tired body.  The story of this cartoon monkey, however, has followed me thru the day. While out a while later, we spotted several references to cartoon monkeys; placemats, napkins and books. It has become a cartoon monkey extravaganza. What is this telling me?  More importantly, why is this the most interesting thing I have to share today?    Notice how I skipped right over the bit about the new boyfriend??
