      Well what a day...not really.  It consisted of my cousin and I playing video games and eating.  Oh yeah I took a nap too.  That is all for my first post, many more to come (hopefully).  PS. Yesterday I bought the Modest Mouse album "Good News For People Who Love Bad News" and it is quite amazing.  Love, Iggy/Alex (whichever you prefer)

      I know it's been a few days or so since my last entry, so I figured I was due for another.  Yesterday I went to the Cubs game, and it was awesome.  The Cubs lost though, so that wasn't cool.  All in all it was a great event.  After the game I went to Peter Evans' house and slept over.  I just got home and that's where we are now.  I think I'm seeing  Dodgeball  tonight.  That is all for now, more soon to come.   I sure do love you...and pie

      I had a fun day, although it didn't work out the way it was supposed to.  The plan was going as planned around 2 and even around 5, but then Jugal, Sean Zolfo, and James couldn't go see Saved! at 7:35.  Then I couldn't go when I asked again.  Plus, I called Craig to hang out, and he was not available for spending time with.  So here I was, just watching TV and trying to call someone to do something, and it didn't end up working at all.  Since that didn't work, I took a nap.  I just woke up five minutes ago because it is "garbage night" and I'm on recycling duty.  Half asleep, I write to you, while every two seconds or so my eyes drift off to something more exciting to look at.  Perhaps they even close from time to time as I doze off into a partial sleep.  I leave you with that thought, and the thought of my grades, which happen to be terrible.  I'm currently sitting at a 3.0 unweighted and a 3.083 weighted (cummulative grades).  That is all for now.  Until next time, I love you.

      Well my day was pretty boring.  I played a ton of guitar, I talked on the internet a bunch too.  Quite a story unfolded today!  Sean McClellan text messaged me saying that he was stuck in a tree, so I replied saying, "Where are you?"  He responded with a witty, "In a tree."  So that's when I had to call him.  I dialed his number, and he was really sorry about texting me.  I said it was alright, and that I had to go.  He again apologized, I again said it was alright.  Then it was over, what an interesting and exciting five minutes that was.  After that, I went back to my guitar and Modest Mouse.  Later on, I watched the Pistons beat the Lakers and win the NBA Championship.  For anyone who cares, it was the first Eastern Conference team to win the championship since the Bulls did it in 1998.  Go Pistons.  Then I talked more and watched part of  Bubba Ho-Tep .  It is one intriguing plot: a mummy invades a retirement home where Elvis and JFK wannabes are living.  Oh yeah, the JFK guy is an old black guy in a wheelchair.  Tis quite the story.  After  Bubba Ho-Tep , I talked online more.  That was my day.  Thank you and good night.  I love  you .

      Oh how I love David Bowie.  Today I have just been sleeping, eating, talking via aim, and cleaning.  Oh yeah I listened to music all day too.  What a day.  Perhaps I will still hang out with someone, seeing as the day is still young enough.  Well, that's all for this entry. Goodbye.  I love you all

      Today was what we in the business world call bittersweet.  I had a fun time golfing and playing poker, yet Bobby Powers is moving to Virginia.  What do I do?  I'll tell you.  I watch the Pistons win game 4 (84-76 Pistons right now).  Okay, I'll tell you my day.  James called me at 8:30 this morning after calling my house, and I said, "Hmm, I'm tired, wanna hang out at 11 or 12?"  So then I went back to sleep, setting my alarm for 10:30.  James then called again at 10:15, waking me up yet again.  Finally, I go downstairs and watch TV.  Then at 11:20 my mom said, "Oh James called this morning at 8:30." Me: "Oh yeah he called my cell phone, wants to hang out around 11:20." Mom: "It is 11:20.  You can't 'hang out' because you have to clean then go to the going away party."  Me: "Oh crap, I'll just call him and tell him I can't do anything."  Mom: "It's kinda late now."  Me: "No, I'll call him."  Mom: "He's probably on his way already."  Me: "No, I'll call him."  So then it happened.  I called James and he said, "That's cool, lets just hang out during the week."  Me: "Sounds like a plan."  James: "Bye Alex."  Me: "Bye James."  Then I continued to clean then I went to Sean Zolfo's house and then to golfing.  Afterwords, we played poker at Andrew's house.  I lost $5.  Duever was there and I didn't like him.  Brian was there and he was better than Duever.  We played wiffleball and I kept makin fun of Duever and he cried.  Then he blamed me for losing Mike's money, which I didn't do.  Then Ben Mebane, Connor, Mike, and I talked about movies.  Sean Zolfo was there too.  After that, we talked about music, then everyone went home.  I went to Zolfo's, where I currently am.  Woo Hoo.

      Yeah...its been a long time since I wrote last.  What's been new?  For me, I've just been hangin' out at Swedish Days and eating and sleeping.  That's what my life has been reduced to now.  Anyway, this week is going to be all Swedish Days.  That's pretty much it for today.   Until next time, I love you.

      I just returned from seeing  Dodgeball , and I must say, it was very entertaining.  The cameos were great, including Walker himself: Chuck Norris, William Shatner, and David Hasselhoff.  I'm tired now, seeing as we saw the late show and I was up late last night and the night before.  So I leave you with this quote from  Dodgeball .    "Fuckin' Chuck Norris."    I still love you.

      There's a reason behind all of this non-posting that has been going on.  I was in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The reason?  To visit with an old pal, and to attend Summerfest.  Perhaps I'll be visiting again on Sunday, July 4, 2004 to bask in the magnificent sounds of Rooney and Jet.  Well, I have to go mow the lawn right now, but I will hopefully write again soon.  God, I hate mowing lawns.  Why do they even grow......

      Today was great, I guess.  I went to Coconuts and bought a Matthew Sweet cd entitled "In Reverse" for $5 for the fact that it was "used", but there wasn't a scratch in sight.  Cleverly enough, the case opens backwards and the booklet inlay opens from the left as well.  Then I came home and found out that my mom, of all people, has a Matthew Sweet cd also.  So the story of the day is:  two Sweets for 5 dollars...Sweet action, indeed.

      I love Beulah.  RIP fellas.  Now that that's over with, we can get on with what we all want: more ramblings.  As you wish.  I'm going to go see Anchorman on Friday, like it or not.  You're welcome to come, just call my house at 1-800-JAYMZ.  When does Napoleon Dynamite come out?  I'd sure like to know.  I like music.  That's all she wrote.   Current listenings:  Polaris- "Hey Sandy", Beulah, The Beatles, The Postal Service. I love you.  "Donde esta la biblioteca?"-- Dodgeball.

      My ps2 is okay after the fiasco, and the guy at EBGames let me exchange my game.  Marvelous.  Right now I'm just talking online and listening to music, like I do much of my day, but perhaps later on I'll watch The Bourne Identity or The Big Lebowski.  That'll be a majestic array of good movies.  Until next time, visit my website at www.sonidostereo.tk.  Have fun, keep it clean, and remember to go to my website.  That is all for now, most likely I'll write again soon.  Good bye.

      Today was good: Andrew came over and I got NCAA Football 2005 by trading in a few old football games, NBA Street, a Gameboy Advance game, and my old Gameboy Advance.  I didn't pay a dime.  But then it happened.  My ps2 "fell" (I accidentally knocked it over.) and now the game has a scratch on it and doesn't work.  Great.  I hope they exchange it.  Well I'm tired now. Good night.

      It's been a fun couple of days.  I saw Anchorman twice.  That was one hell of a movie.  Go see it.  I demand it.  Also, I watched the Home Run Derby tonight.  It was a grand event with Miguel Tejada winning, although I chose Lance Berkman to win it.  Well that's all for my sports ramblings for the night.  My current fixations in the music world are Matthew Sweet and The Postal Service.  Finally, I want a Texas-shaped belt buckle.  That's all I ask for.  Please God reward me with a Texas-shaped belt buckle.   There were horses, and I threw a trident.

      Wow. I can change the color of my text.&nbsp;  Oh the wonders of science.&nbsp;   Today was fun, Taylor and Sean came over.&nbsp;   We "rocked", if you can call it that, anyways, we rocked your proverbial socks off.&nbsp;   It was grand.&nbsp;   Look out world, make way for this "band".  &nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, we actually suck, considering we don't have a drummer and this was our first time with all three of us together  .&nbsp; We shall bide our time and make our appearance someday.....yes someday.&nbsp;  Anyways,&nbsp;it's going to be 92 degrees tomorrow and I'm going to stay inside my air conditioned house. &nbsp;  Anyone is welcome to join me for movie watching and  lemonade  drinking. &nbsp;  Well,&nbsp;it's about time I stop writing. &nbsp;&nbsp;  Until next time.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I've had a revelation.  On the Mojo magazine website, I can sell this White Stripes Dvd for $89.75.  How cool is that?  I'll tell you.  Pretty cool.  That's right.  It's been awhile since I last wrote, for that I apologize, but I've been busy.  No, not really, I haven't.  But I watched Kill Bill 2 tonight and it's incredibly good.  Go rent it or buy it.  Now.  I got Carvel cake today and I got a discount.  Woo-hoo.  Mr. Patel is nice.  I saw Jugal there, too.  Tomorrow/Today, I will invite people over to play poker and hang out.  It shall be grand.  Keep your eyes and ears open.  Big things are on the horizon.  Perhaps a new website design, perhaps not.  I hope so.  Well, I'm gonna go talk to more people, then go to sleep.  Good night.
