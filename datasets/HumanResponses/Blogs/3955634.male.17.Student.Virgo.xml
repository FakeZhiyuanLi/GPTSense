      This is a new format for me -- as a&nbsp;LiveJournal veteran of over two years, this new online home is something of a revolution for the journaling process. In fact, maybe now the word 'blog' can rightfully be applied to what I write on the internet. Though still an exhibitionist phenomenon, this is an excellent opportunity to explore slightly more significant thoughts, findings, and ideas.  &nbsp;  With that in mind, I'll inaugurate the whole thing with a blogging clich√©; commenting on a New York Times piece. Nicholas Kristof just wrote up a column about the disturbing "Left Behind" series of Christian Fundamentalist novels. In the most recent, Jesus returns to earth to brutally slaughter all the heathens (non-Christians), leaving the world only to his followers. It's a murderfest that evokes&nbsp;frustration of the media's portrayal of Muslim Fundamentalism as violent and the Christian equivalent as somehow pure, but I digress.&nbsp; urlLink Read the&nbsp;column for yourself &nbsp;if you're registered at the Times' site.  &nbsp;  There is one other bit I want to throw out there before calling it an eDay. There is a reason I've decided to entitle this blog "Either-Or" and it's not merely&nbsp;for the purpose of literary or musical reference. As an atheist and an anti-fatalist, I and many others see the world as a huge conundrum that is being worked out constantly by a combination of random chance and distinct choices. Also speaking as a young person in a country so reputed for freedom and liberty, there are some massive choices that are on my own personal horizon. While trying not to overdramatize or overstate the gravity of my day-to-day life (and also avoiding the boring nature of such a topic), one goal I've got here is to present these choices and the consequential effects. It should be an interesting time, hopefully for any readers as well.

      Well well well. It seems the Pentagon managed to  urlLink dig up and rediscover  some of President Bush's payroll info from his service in the Alabama Air National Guard. Nothing new, really, but the timing is pretty peculiar, as the Democratic Convention in Boston is just about to begin. DNC Chairman Terry McAuliffe (gotta love him) had this to say:   "The supposed discovery of these records on Friday afternoon, as reporters converge on Boston to cover the Democratic National Convention, is highly questionable. If the Bush Administration continues to search, maybe they'll find answers to the long list of unanswered questions that remain about George W. Bush's time in the Air National Guard. Bush's military records seem to show up as randomly as he did for duty." You tell 'em, Terry. That last zinger especially made my day.

      From the L.A. Times, courtesy of the Lexington Herald-Leader:  urlLink U.S. policy on Israel key motive for effort . This only serves to highlight the oxymoron "War on Terror" carried on by President Bush. Supporting, for example, the Israeli security fence (also known as a wall) along the West Bank does more to promote further terrorist activity against the United States and Israel than to prevent it.  You can't kill all your problems away, or wall them off. It takes a lot more, and in four years of leading this nation, President Bush has yet to show he is committed to actually resolving the crisis in Palestine, and in turn, seriously healing the terror-breeding wounds&nbsp;in the Middle East.

      There's no cute way to introduce this one: Indonesia's constiutional court has  urlLink deemed the nation's&nbsp;tough anti-terror law of 2002 to be illegal . Many have wondered what will come next, and it appears the course is fairly simple:    A court official said Friday's decision would not overturn the Bali bombing convictions. But, lawyers representing many of the Bali attackers say the ruling will now allow them to appeal.  Democracy and due process at work? Watch for George W. Bush to find those pesky WMDs in Jakarta sometime around September. You heard it here first, folks!

      With the 9/11 Commission's report now hitting the streets, the exact details are starting to come out. From the  urlLink Drudge Report :     The 9/11 commission report offers a broad critique of a central tenet of the Bush administration's foreign policy, that the attacks have required a 'war on terrorism'... The report argues that the notion of fighting an enemy called "terrorism" is too diffuse and vague to be effective. Strikingly, the report also makes no reference to the invasion of Iraq as being part of the war on terrorism, a frequent assertion of President Bush and his top aides...  In other news, a threatning note found on an Amtrak train  urlLink caused a 90-minute delay  today ( urlLink Pandagon  has a nice spin on it). The train, on a Washington-to-New York route, was deemed safe after police inspection and continued on. If you're like me, then you're probably wondering how an Amtrak train being 90 minutes late is newsworthy. Sounds like a pretty efficient day by their standards!

      The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution last night condemning the Israeli 'security fence' dividing the nation from the occupied West Bank territory.&nbsp;The vote&nbsp;was 150 to 6, with 10 abstentions, and the  urlLink entire European Union voted in favor . Palestinian reaction bordered on Euphoric;  urlLink the Guardian reports :  The Palestinian UN observer, Nasser al-Kidwa, praised the resolution as possibly the most important passed by the general assembly since the 1947 vote partitioning British-ruled Palestine between Arabs and Jews.  Israel's response was about as predictable. Dan Gillerman, the ambassador to the UN, put it this way: "It is simply outrageous to respond with such vigour to a measure that will save lives."  Well, Dan, the ends always justify the means, don't they?

      Six more truck drivers abducted by Mujahedeen types in Iraq. If the situation weren't so serious, the statement the captors have released would almost be humorous:    "We have warned all the countries, companies, businessmen and truck drivers that those who deal with American cowboy occupiers will be targeted by the fires of the Mujahedeen. Here you are once again transporting goods, weapons and military equipment that backs the U.S. Army.''  American cowboy occupiers? Well, it looks like Bill O'Reilly got his wish. We're back to the Wild West, but I don't know if this is quite what he expected -- unless Al Franken is one of those abducted.

      Ben Cohen, one-half of the Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream partnership, is out on the road with what he's calling the "PantsOnFire-Mobile". The  urlLink Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports :   The "PantsOnFire-Mobile" is a trailer pulled behind a car. The Bush character is wearing a flight suit with the words "Mission Accomplished" emblazoned on the back, a reference to the president's declaration that major hostilities had ended in Iraq. An electronic ticker on the front shows what Cohen says are Bush's lies.   Furthermore, the effigy's lower half is notably enflamed, lending some context to the aforementioned title of the nomadic display. &nbsp; With two PantsOnFire-Mobiles now in commission, Cohen plans to have them tour the entire nation nonstop until Election Day, November 2nd. So far the project has visited five states.

      Your favorite overrated rap artist (well, there's worse), Sean "Puffy" Combs -- or wait, that's Sean "P. Diddy" Combs -- has  urlLink begun a get-out-the-vote campaign  entitled "Citizen Change". What's unique about the whole thing is the catch phrase being used: VOTE OR DIE.&nbsp;  &nbsp;     The campaign claims to be non-partisan, but based on the involvement of James Carville (taking an advising role) and the aim at youths and minorities, Kerry can expect a bit of help from P. Diddy &amp; Co.   As of yet, there is no word on whether Howard Dean will be enlisting hip-hop troupe Outkast for his  urlLink Democracy For America  organization. After all,&nbsp; urlLink that dude can dance .

      For all the guff that the&nbsp;Philippines is&nbsp;receiving from Washington and Baghdad, you've got to respect the distinct attention paid to popular interest. If you haven't heard, the Filipino truck driver taken hostage in Iraq a&nbsp;few weeks back&nbsp; urlLink was finally released , following the speedy&nbsp;removal of the small Filipino force there. This is what the people of the Philippines wanted -- security&nbsp;and peace, and their man (and all the troops)&nbsp;back home in one piece. &nbsp; What if the boys in D.C. actually listened to their constituents? What a world it would be.

      The Guardian  urlLink reports  that President Vladimir Putin has "fired three of Russia's top generals and a senior state security official yesterday after suffering a series of humiliating setbacks in Chechnya." &nbsp; It seems that the proud Russian tradition of sacking high-ranking officers and military advisers lives on. After all, it was Stalin who eliminated the entire command structure of the armed forces just years before the second World War. &nbsp; Let's just hope that this isn't a bad omen. World War III coming out of the conflict in Chechnya? And here I've been ranting about the  urlLink Taiwan Straits issue  for all this time.

      Further French outrage at the recent comments of Ariel Sharon, telling French Jews they 'must go to Israel' to escape persecution and danger. With no offense intended, and with all due respect for the situation -- swastikas on gravestones or bus and checkpoint bombings? &nbsp; I'll take France. &nbsp; Anyhow, President Jacques Chirac has  urlLink politely told Sharon to stay out of Paris , at least according to Israeli television. The exact words are a bit more blunt than usual for this kind of high-level diplomacy: "You are not welcome following your comments."  In other news, the US media has yet to fully pick up on the Allawi prisoner execution scandal.  urlLink Even Rush Limbaugh buys it . Your best bet is to follow that link and see Atrios' coverage -- I can't keep up with this story nearly fast enough.

      This isn't even that fresh of a story, but the American and European press have been slow to pick up on it. There are accusations and eyewitness accounts of an incident a few months back, before the handover of sovereignty in Iraq, that  urlLink Prime Minister Iyad Allawi personally executed six foreign insurgents  who were being held in a Baghdad prison. The Sydney Morning Herald's award-winning Paul McGeough has defended this controversial claim, and investigations have commenced.  &nbsp;  Cheers to Holden over&nbsp;at&nbsp; urlLink Atrios &nbsp;for following the story as it continues to unfold. If this all turns out to be true, you can bet the US press will be circling like&nbsp;vultures&nbsp;--&nbsp;but for now apparently there will be no mention.  &nbsp;  This is&nbsp;precisely&nbsp;why blogging is such a phenomenon, ladies and gentlemen.

      I'd like to avoid the trap of over-saturation on this blog, but there's one bit of news I was reading that I can't help but point out as troubling: Ariel Sharon's comment that  urlLink French Jews 'must' move to Israel  to escape persecution. Paris is furious, the Foreign Ministry rightfully labeling the comment 'unacceptable' and demanding an explanation.  &nbsp;  The irony of it all is that Sharon's comments will only serve to heat up anti-semitism around the globe. What kind of world leader so deliberately and audaciously would tell foreign citizens what their best decisions and options are? One gets the impression Mr Sharon is suffering from the worst case of hubris in the world (even including the White House).  &nbsp;  Right now the&nbsp;most harmful thing to Judaism across the earth is the policy and attitude of Israel under Ariel Sharon and the Likud Party.  &nbsp;  (ADDENDUM: Worth seeing is  urlLink this photo from Reuters/Vincent Kessler . It's not just the Jews who are suffering from racial hatred in France. Though the problem is far from widespread on the whole, it's definitely important to note that Muslims (5 million strong in France) are also receiving swastikas as treats from racist vandals.)   (ADDENDUM #2: This is silly but can't go unmentioned.  urlLink Matt Drudge is insane . Completely off his rocker.)

      I had written a fairly lengthy commentary on the new and controversial Tonic of Uptown ( urlLink read about it here ), generally in favor of its continued existence, when I popped a CD into the drive. In my spare time I write music reviews for a site called  urlLink 30music , and while working on the Tonic piece I figured I'd start on a fairly promising sounding group called Otasco. Two birds, one stone, you know how it goes.  &nbsp;  Unfortunately, the following maelstrom of technological failures put a dent in my plans. After iTunes failed to&nbsp;locate an artist or tracknames in the CDDB, I confusedly began playing the first track. Instead of music coming through the speakers, there was dead silence, and the "Time Elapsed" marquee failed to move in any direction.  &nbsp;  Okay, so I've got a dud disk, I figured. No problem, just eject it and put in another for now.   It wasn't meant to be. First pushing the cute eject button in iTunes, followed by the one on the drive itself, there were no results. The little yellow light in the drive kept pulsating, all the while the mechanics inside whizzing and working, but the one thing I needed to happen was the one thing that wasn't  going  to happen. Even using the task manager function of Windows, I was unable to close iTunes or get that disc out.  &nbsp;  But what about my big Tonic entry? I quickly copied the text, hoping to open NotePad or Word and save it as a file to come back to after a speedy reboot. Upon clicking the start menu, the entire screen froze up, and I sat there staring in horror. My work was gone and there was a CD stuck in the drive. Better yet, Windows entirely froze up, not a good sign for my general operations.  &nbsp;  A few reboots later, here I am, and I sense the impending review for the Otasco disc is going to be shadowed in my bitterness towards its inability to work with a three year old computer.  &nbsp;  And if it turns out that the failure of the disc to play was a result of some copy-protection scheme, you can bet the album's going to be getting a pretty abysmal score.

      Not posting much this weekend, but this whole vets-against-Kerry-but-wait-one-recanted-no-he-didn't affair is finally starting to come together.

      Al Jazeera has an interesting article up about the damage being done to ancient sites in Iraq by occupying forces. One such example is the infamous city of Babylon, which is essentially the base of operations for Polish peacekeepers. Anyhow,  urlLink read the piece , it's fairly interesting, partly because a lot of the complaints about the coalition troops are coming from people within the Iraqi government.

       Damn pdf files keep crashing my browser...one of the few downsides to using Firefox, otherwise it's making IE look like a  urlLink helpless Brit in the hands of a Gitmo interrigator .  One of my favorite news stories this cycle has been the elevation of Annie Jacobson to minor celebrity status for her  urlLink harrowing account  of how fourteen Syrian musicians engaging in "suspicious activities" with a McDonald's bag nearly hijacked her plane. Beyond singing the praises of racial profiling, it's also  urlLink complete bunk .  But that doesn't prevent our friends on the other side of the aisle from coming up with  urlLink new ways to spend our tax dollars .  Man, what a great way to earn a quick C-note...I'm sure Jesse Taylor's already  urlLink working on his tan !  I think it's just precious: we go from sensational, barely verified reporting that proposes a shortsighted answer to our immediate fears (racial profiling of airline passengers) to an equally shortsighted answer (let's give them money for inconviencing them!). I cannot say that I'm not fearful when I get on a plane, but I'm more worried about my luggage than whether I'm going to end up plastered to the I-beams of a local skyscraper. Given the thousands upon thousands of flights every year, the statistical probablity of actually ending up on a flight with a bunch of terrorists building bombs in the head makes worrying about it incessantly rather...well, silly. I know our security has more holes than a good block of Wisconsin swiss, but  what can I do about it?  I'm not willing to compromise the rights of others just to feel safer for the few hours a year I spend on a plane. We all shell out our dough and sometimes we have to sit next to the fat guy who falls asleep right away. I don't want the next thing we all share to be a rigorous questioning by federal officials.  More generally, it's just getting harder for me to follow the news these days.  Watching one presidential candidate  urlLink wall himself off from his audiences  while the other has to  urlLink blatantly pose with the flag  so roughly half the country will stoop to look at him (let alone listen to what he has to say) is disheartening. Then there's the Bush administration fielding yet another outrageous idea: let's save corporations money by  urlLink sticking it to workers ! That'll push the markets even higher, and maybe get our economy rolling again! But wait...didn't our very own Vice President get in trouble for trying to artificially inflate his company's stock?  urlLink Oh...right . Never mind about that one--he's too busy rewriting energy policy to favor his pals in the private sector.  And let's not  urlLink forget  about  urlLink Iraq , or all the  urlLink money  we're spending on it (what could  I  do with fifteen grand?  Hmmm...), much as our news media would like us to.  But then I'll stumble across something like  urlLink this , and it's just enough to pick myself up again.  Who am I to say the Boss is wrong?

      John Kerry's legal team is striking back at the veterans group sniping at his war record. You can  urlLink see a letter at Human Events  that is being sent to the television stations airing the ad ( urlLink watch it here ).  Two main points of interest the letter: First, not one of those men was a crewmate of Kerry (all his living crewmates support him). Even more seriously, there are  no records  of the "doctor" in the video having actually treated Kerry. We'll see how this develops.

It gets better:   You've been acting mighty rash And talking that trash Let me give you some advice You can crawl back in your hole Like a dirty little mole   And this is the best we can do? I'd encourage people to avoid Charlie Daniels wherever possible; both as a political statement, and for the common good. This shit is  depressing !

      In regard to the  urlLink anti-Kerry veterans group  previously mentioned here:   urlLink John McCain is now speaking out  against the ad campaign these veterans are running. What they're trying to do is tarnish Kerry's image by making all sorts of wild accusations about his time in the military, and it's on TV in three swing states now (Wisconsin, Ohio, West Virginia).  The major media outlets have been timid about this story, and rightfully so. Giving too much press to these ultra-right whackos only encourages them. On the other hand, it's kind of odd that in a Google News search, it took til page two to find  urlLink a mainstream source .  Will this move backfire and consolidate middle-of-the-road Americans behind Kerry? It certainly could, and time will tell... but the blatantly hateful message of these veterans (who didn't serve on the same boat as Kerry, FYI) shouldn't help the Bush campaign much. It's just too transparent.

      That's right -- Alan Keyes, two-time presidential hopeful (who faltered both times obviously), and conservative nutjob,  urlLink is running for the United States Senate  in Illinois. A resident of Maryland, Keyes will be moving to his new home state by the November 2nd election, as Illinois law dictates.  urlLink Follow this as it unfolds . Keyes is going to be running against the almost unstoppable force of  urlLink Barack Obama , State Senator and charisma-giant.  urlLink His speech  at the Democratic Convention was one of the finest I've ever seen -- you can  urlLink watch it here  if you'd like.  My thoughts? Nice try, GOP.. the bigwigs in the party figure "Hey, people like Obama because he's black, right?" and so they put up their own black political figure in opposition. Sorry guys, it's not that easy. Obama is one of the most charismatic and energetic up-and-comers in the game. Even Tucker Carlson has called this one in favor of Obama, and I'd put a link to that comment, but it was a confession he made on Crossfire yesterday. I swear!  ADDENDUM: Okay, that wasn't quite right. He's been  invited  to run for the Senate under GOP endorsement. Still counting on it though.

       Much too early to think serious thoughts.  But I know you kids need something to do...  Mark Gisleson encourages us to  urlLink take our media back.      There‚Äôs something you can do. Verbally abuse reporters. I‚Äôm serious. If you‚Äôre at a political event and you see someone with a notebook, walk up and ask who they‚Äôre with. Then give them an earful about what whores they are. If they try to weasel out by blaming their editors or producers, ask them where they draw the line, and run that analogy all the way to Hitler, if need be. The media cooperates with Bush because we don‚Äôt make them pay a price for their complicity. Social shunning is a powerful tool, and what better punishment for media whores than not being able to hang out with the cool kids and having to miss all the best parties.  And for those of you who  urlLink like   urlLink pictures  (courtesy of Bob Herbert at Tom Tomorrow).  It's enough to warm the cockles of this dirt poor college student's heart.

      So much for positive politics.  urlLink Matt Drudge is hyping  the new book  Unfit For Command , written by a conservative veterans group attempting to smudge John Kerry's war record. These men, who did not even serve on the same boat as Kerry, are making wild accusations left and right. At one point, the book claims that "Kerry entered an abandoned Vietnamese village and slaughtered the domestic animals owned by the civilians and burned down their homes with his Zippo lighter."  This is coming from the same right wing that claimed everything Kerry did in Vietnam was to prepare for an eventual career in politics. So which is it, I wonder? Was Kerry a picture-perfect example of false chivalry, or a wild and loose cannon who wandered around endangering his crewmates (who overwhemingly support him) and harming innocents?  The Republicans are sinking to incredible new lows in this election. From their financing, and petitioning  urlLink on behalf of Ralph Nader , to the  urlLink absolute lies about John Kerry and his agenda , and now this. If the American people don't call Bush and his cronies on this, then you can bet that '08 is going to be even dirtier.

      Creepy conservative Governor Tim Pawlenty here in Minnesota is at it again. He's managed to  urlLink funnel $22.5 million  into the proposed Northstar Commuter Rail project, in a move that almost makes me like him. Besides putting the Taxpayers League, a no-new-taxes group that absolutely abhors public education or really any other services the state provides, ahead of the needs of Minnesotans young and old, Pawlenty's not such a terrible guy.  This rail project is exactly what the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro needs. Congestion here is maniacal at times, and with the rapid influx of Hmong, Somali, and Latino immigrants, we're really in no position to stop building up infrastructure. We're lightyears behind similarly sized metropolitan areas, and with the newly completed Hiawatha LRT, a commuter rail system is the next step (well, besides expanding said LRT).  Props to a crappy governor for doing at least one thing right. I'm still voting against him when he's on the ballot, but hey -- this takes a tiny bit of the pain away.

       Yes,  The Butterfly Effect  was a terrible, terrible film (and one that even showed promise).  Yes, trucker hats are ugly as sin.  Yes,  Punk'd  is an awkward excuse for comedy.  But you have to give Ashton Kutcher some credit--he's doing  something  for this country by  urlLink loosening up the Bushes .

       Josh Marshall's been busy mulling over  urlLink the use of humor as a rhetorical weapon , but I can't say I agree with his conclusion. Perhaps it doesn't play out in the traditional media, but liberals can be pretty damn caustic (proof  urlLink here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here , and urlLink  here ).  Humor strikes me as more useful in solidifying a candidate's base--Bush's fans "get it" when the flash-animated Bush (of  urlLink jibjab  fame) accuses Kerry of having "more waffles than a house of pancakes"; liberals just get upset. Likewise, endlessly mocking Bush's misuse of the English Language produces the opposite effect. Humor may lighten the mood of the election a bit, but it's not going to introduce any newcomers to the political process. Mocking Kerry as undistinguished simply isn't going to make sense to those who don't follow politics, and may actually turn them off--having to explain an inside joke kind of kills the funny.  For now I'm saying this is a misstep. Rove may be trying to do damage control to save some of Bush's home votes, but I don't think he's even considering picking up votes...there's not too many undecideds out there waiting for images of Kerry in a  urlLink blue bunny suit , or for someone on a TV ad to accuse him of being a UN pussy. I think the general populace deserves a wee bit (and I do mean very wee indeed) more credit.

      Well well well.. if it isn't just the cutest darn thing I've ever seen. The Republicans  urlLink talking about getting rid of the IRS ? Average Joe American scratches his chin, takes a sip of his Bud Light, and shrugs. "Sounds good to me! I hate taxes!"  Which is precisely how elections are won. Well, that and turning it around so as to say that the challenger is going to raise taxes for everybody, even if this is a blatant lie. As Adlai Stevenson so eloquently put it, "I have been thinking that I would make a proposition to my Republican friends... that if they will stop telling lies about the Democrats, we will stop telling the truth about them."  Of course, they didn't bite, and we had eight years of Eisenhower. By today's standards, that sounds pretty damn good..

        Is it something in the water that makes them so wacky?  St. Paul mayor Randy Kelly, after a week of hemming and hawing, is  urlLink endorsing Bush  in this year's presidential race.  It's a decision that bears a striking resemblance to another  urlLink local pol's   But honestly, I hope things work out for Kelly. He's fighting an uphill battle, what with one now-partisan former-St.-Paul-mayor Democrat-turned-Republican senator already bumming around with the cool kids in the White House. But then again, it's not like Bush   previous actions...and what did he do? Why, he went on to win a Senate seat for his brand new party! Isn't it amazing what a little help from the preznit will get you? wants   to be  urlLink exposed to new ideas .  He seems to have enough trouble grasping the  urlLink ones he's supposed to be working on  right now.

      Phew! Common sense still exists -- Bloomberg reports:  urlLink U.S. Halts Najaf Attacks; Iraqis Seek Truce Accord . Interestingly enough for you Minnesotans out there, an Iraqi professor from St. Cloud State somehow managed to get his views into the article. Not that there's anything wrong with St. Cloud State (besides having a horribly depressing campus), but you don't exactly see their name mentioned in big news stories very often. Props, I guess.

      Indeed, the operations intended to wipe Moqtada al-Sadr and his Mahdi Army off the geopolitical map of Iraq have begun. Details are sketchy thus far, but the AP has a  urlLink brief write-up in circulation . But here's what you  really  want to know: ABC News Australia  urlLink has the scoop on how oil is being affected  by all this mess in Iraq. Yes, kids, we're breaking records for crude prices. Now I'm just waiting for the PLO to organize some huge theatrical terrorist attack on the Athens games (fate forbid), and it'll be the 1970s all over again.  Oh, and apparently we're  urlLink bombing al-Sadr's house . Hey, I'll bet he's watching cartoons right now. It's not like there's a battle going on.

        urlLink Juan Cole  on what Kerry  should  have   said in response to Bush's facile question regarding the War in da 'raq/War on Terra:   "Mr. President, the question of whether we should have gone to war is water under the bridge. We are in Iraq now, and are on the way to spending $500 billion on it at a time when many of our own people don't have insurance or cannot afford the drugs they need, or cannot build a needed new school. You have posed a counterfactual question, an imaginary question. There is no way to answer a question about an imaginary situation. Why don't you keep your feet on the ground and your head out of the clouds, and look what is happening to our troops in Iraq? What I can tell you is that the way you fought the war in Iraq has made Americans less safe, not more safe. You have diverted resources from fighting al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and the Pakistani border regions to bombarding Muslim holy sites in Iraq. You have allowed the poppy trade to come back, to the tune of over $2 billion a year, in Afghanistan, creating a powerful threat of narco-terrorism. Do we really want the remanants of the Taliban and al-Qaeda to get hold of that kind of drug money? You have thrown Iraq into political and military chaos, creating an unstable situation that could well breed terrorism against the United States. Your supporters are fond of calling you the "commander in chief" even with reference to your civilian role. But you are the commander in chief of the US armed forces, and you have not served them well by sending in a force too small to provide security to post-war Iraq." Shrub knows the press will never call him on it.  You can't fault his (rather, Rove's, perhaps?) political saavy.  More on that  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .

      Iraq today:   Washington Post:  urlLink Ominous Calm Settles Over Baghdad   International Herald Tribune (AP):  urlLink U.S. forces put off Najaf offensive   Telegraph.co.uk:  urlLink US marines poised to crush Najaf revolt   ABC News:  urlLink Iraqi Prime Minister Speaks About Security Problems, Najaf Revolt, Olympic Hopes   The Guardian:  urlLink Beside the ruined Valley of Peace, Sadr's men wait for martyrdom   Yahoo! News (WPFS):  urlLink Cemetery Fight Haunts Some U.S. Soldiers    The most chilling thing I read all day was the last article there. The operations being conducted in such close proximity to the shrine of Imam Ali are risky business. It seems almost inevitable that something is going to happen to the mosque, and supposing it's even moderately serious damage, we'll have a whole new wave of Jihadists on our hands.  Which reminds me of another disturbing point. Moqtada al-Sadr's men are not necessarily "terrorists" or "insurgents" but something entirely different. What the Mahdi Army has become is a symbol of the Iraqi resistance -- by Iraqis,  for  Iraqis. For all the talk of foreign extremists fighting the U.S. troops over there, it seems weird not to take into account the incredible power (particularly in areas such as Najaf, Falluja, and the Sadr City slums of Baghdad) of this kind of movement. We won't be able to merely kill our way out of this; there's a lot of Shi'ites out there and I don't think we're ready for genocide just yet!  ADDENDUM: New violence in Najaf,  urlLink perhaps the big offensive ? Hopefully we'll know more by the morning. Goodnight, world.

       Working on a post on Iraq/Isreal/the Middle East for later...it might not be up until tomorrow, so for now here's some shiny things to distract you.   urlLink MyDD  has a  urlLink well-ordered breakdown  of the House races, along with some commentary.  Along with  urlLink Kos , it's the place to go for general updates on the latest polls and some basic poll analysis.  I sure as hell hope  urlLink Jesse Taylor is right .  Along with  urlLink national preparedness month , it looks like BushCo and Karl Rove are rolling out a comprehensive plan to frighten parents into voting for Bush to keep their children safe. Bob Herbert has a few details at  urlLink Tom Tomorrow , too.  I can't quite express how appalling I find this new tactic. It plays on ordinary people's fears in such a cold, calculated manner. And honestly, I can't see how this will win Bush votes. Not only is it negative campaigning (which people profess to dislike), but it's negative campaigning with no target--or a target so vague that it ends up meaning little or nothing. Beyond breeding caution and fear and subtly encouraging bigotry (keep an eye out for those Syrian musicians especially! Jeepers!), what's the point?  Oh.  That  is  the point. To get the nation to come back to Daddy Bush after getting a glimpse of the wide, wide world outside. Shit man, isn't it  scary  out there?  Come back and we'll  urlLink tell you how to shut it all out .  That is, as long as you ignore the fact that Kerry is doing  urlLink quite well   urlLink for himself .  And it looks like Bush is losing a  urlLink few   urlLink important   urlLink groups , ones that he really needs to keep a handle on in order to win this thing. Young and old, it looks like the public is starting to get a handle on what's happening to them, and connecting it to the people in power.   urlLink And what  about  the children?    Beyond that fact that we're  urlLink chronically underfunding education (warning:big pdf)?  Firing young, vibrant  urlLink teachers ?   Fifty-five percent  think they're going to have to serve in the military someday.  At the University of Minnesota they've  urlLink raised tuition  by double digit percentages four years in a row--I'm paying fifty percent more for credits than a graduate of just five years ago. If I have a personal bone to pick with these guys, it's the sorry state of education funding in our country in general and Minnesota in particular. I'm all for streamlining the funding process, trying to weed out the bad apples (be it  urlLink teachers  [*wink] or  urlLink administrators ), and in finding educational approaches that work for more children.  The way to do that is not to cut funding to pre-90s levels.  More money  may not  equal better education, but less money  certainly does not  equal better education.  Curses, I've lost my focus...talking about education always gets my dander up.  Expect more on this topic sometime soon.  As for the fear in electoral politics, it's hard to miss these days.  But from now on I'll be paying a bit more intention to the target of the message.

      Pandagon  urlLink has the scoop  on one of the most bizarre political bitch moves in the history of our republic, and it comes in the form of Congressman Rodney Alexander. I'd say more but I'm still not quite clear on what's going on down there in Louisiana; I'd recommend just following that previous link.  In other news, good ol'  urlLink Moqtada al-Sadr  has vowed to fight the U.S. troops to the bitter end, and told his Mahdi Army to go on and resist even if he dies. There's a few different perspectives on this in the media, and Aljazeera has  urlLink one of the more colorful pieces  as usual. The Guardian has written up  urlLink a good brief  on all the latest developments over there in Iraq, and AFP has  urlLink more details  regarding the situation on the ground.  EDIT: The Sydney Morning Herald has a pretty cool biography of two unique fighters in the Mahdi Army.  urlLink See for yourself .  Posting has been slow lately, but we're hanging in there. I blame the unseasonably cold weather here.. it slows down the blood.

      Granted it's cooled down a bit, but one has to wonder how John McCain was even able to walk for a while.

      The Illinois Senate race this fall is going to be nothing short of hilarious. Alan Keyes, whose  urlLink hypocritical carpetbagging ,  urlLink ludicrous platform  and ultra-Christian  urlLink hatred for church-state independence  have defined him as nothing less than an extremist, thinks he stands a chance for the Senate seat in Illinois. It's going to be great watching  urlLink Barack Obama  take him to the hoop, and shatter the backboard while he's at it.  Best quote out there is him saying that if he wins, " urlLink the victory is for God ." I sure hope an interviewer asks what an Obama victory could be attributed to.  And on a completely unrelated note, maybe you're interested in reading about the Democratic Party's  urlLink anti-semitism problem . Huh?!

      What's this? Gov.

"I really appreciate his music, but I wish he wouldn't interject his music with politics," Tim was quoted as saying. Tough shit! I'm sick of that "Proud to be an American" song they play at the Twins games, but you don't see an AP story about that, now do you? Ugh!  If you're interested in getting tickets for the  urlLink Vote For Change tour , I'd suggest  urlLink signing up for pre-sale  as soon as possible. From what I've been hearing in other markets ( urlLink Billmon is desperate ), these things are going  fast . Hell, maybe I'll even try to get a ticket.
