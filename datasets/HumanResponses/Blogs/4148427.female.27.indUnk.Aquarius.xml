      Ahhh, So after a talk with a friend and a weekend in the country I'm much calmer. Saturday was absolutely wonderful. JB and I went to a farmer's market, went swimming then fell asleep on the grass in the shade. The relaxation was much needed and I feel soo great. Oh, we went shopping on Friday and I spent way too much money. I got some supper cute heels though. I've always been into girlie things. I love pink but this season is making it sooo much easier to be into pink. I love it. I bought little pink heels with wonderful tiny black bows on the side. I also bought a bunch of "work" clothes. I'm soo happy!

      Well this will be my first entry. Here goes.... I'm 27 and I feel like I'm going on 80. I have a huge cat and an amazing boyfriend and we all live happily together. The only imperfect thing about my Prince Charming is, He has not asked "the" question yet. Officially we have lived together for 1 year and including that time we have been together 1 year and 9 months. I really want to be married to him. More than anything ever. We have never fought and he doesn't annoy me. Even when he doesn't load the dishwasher correctly. I want to have a baby or two and live happily ever after. I'm not really that naive, but that is what I want. Before this one I was in a relationship that, although I'm glad it ended, was supposed to be a marriage. And when My current boyfriend (lets call him "JB") JB and I decided to move in together he was aware of my desire for marriage and told me he wouldn't move in if that's not where he thought we were headed. I made a deal with myself that if he did ask within a year then he is OUT. Well, I know it's hard to believe but he really is practically perfect. When I hear friends discuss the stupid, thoughtless, even rude crap their boyfriends do it just makes JB's halo shine brighter. It takes time right? There is no time limit on love....Right??? No, really, I want someone to tell me to relax. It's hard to decide whether or not to stick around and wait for a proposal or find someone who is less who I want and just get married so I can start a family. I feel like I have to choose between a GREAT guy or having kids (the bio-clock is a tickn' and I ain't gettin' younger).
