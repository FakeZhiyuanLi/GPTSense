      Well only five days to go...gonna do up my laundry, get packed, do some shopping.  I need to buy a case of beer and a birthday present for my aunt definitely.  Her's is the 1st and maybe if i'm lucky I'll get a gift for MY birthday down there too!  Here's hoping!  I'm so very excited.   The car is booked...insurance is purchased...all that's left is cashing my paycheck on tuesday (hopefully) exchanging it to yankee dollars and making our run for florida.   WOO HOO  I'm not too big on the new scheduling going on at work.  It actually sucks rather heavily.  Paul the kitchen manager has been asked to work more in the kitchen.  which means he snags all the premium dayshifts, the greedy bastard.  THAT means Chad gets bumped into the closer position which WAS mine.  Which mean that I get bumbed into evenings and split shifts.  Definitely the shitiest of shifts.  Yeah me.  TECHNICALLY i'm still 2 down from the top of the kitchen ladder.  But i also get saddled with the crap of the shifts.  I REALLY need a new job...anyone know any openings?  Drop me a line...please!  Apparently i'm only popular when i already have plans and am out of the house.  As evidenced by last Wednesday.  See...i had plans to hang with Derek my boss/buddy, Rich, Zeke and our pal Andy who's back from BC for 2 weeks.  Of course...only on THIS day do i get A] an invite out to dinner with friends and B] an invite out for drinks with a couple coworkers.  Sigh.  I love these little curve balls life tosses at me :P  I can't think of anything else right now  Signing Off

      I'd like to share a thought i had today with all you readers out there.  It was a very profound contemplation that happened at a very bizarre moment.  I'll get to what moment that was momentarily.  For the moment, bear with me in my story.  There's a stretch of sidewalk in front of a Tim Horton's on Ontario St. here that leads up to a traffic light where it crosses Waterloo St.  I've riden this path, maybe 50-60 times on my bicycle...likely more...to work and back everyday.  I'm pretty familiar with this particular stretch of concrete, needless to say.  So i'm rolling along at a pretty decent clip, the sidewalk's mainly empty and there's a decent amount of traffic flowing along Ontario st.  The light's been green now for about 10 seconds and shows no sign of changing soon so i have no need to brake, really, but i decided to coast through it, keeping an eye for cars with turn signals on.  That's a significant point there, by the way.  Then, as I'm approaching the curb this grey sedan (a grand am i think, not that EVERYone doesn't have a grand am) whips around the corner in front of me, cutting off my path.  Reflexively i slam down on my brakes.  My contemplation was this:  Is there a point at which it's ok for the driver of a car to just completely forget everything he should know about driving?  I had my contemplation approximately 1.5 seconds after this...as i'm flipping through the air over my handlebars down onto my head and shoulders.  Of course the car doesn't even slow down to look at the poor biker who did some gymnastics to avoid denting his precious car.    So i dusted my self off and checked for blood or broken bones and carried on to work.    Son of a bitch.

      Just under 2 weeks to go till the big day...one whole friggin week away from my job and this city and EVERYthing...except for pete, but i can deal with that. Though now we have to make a detour in Ohio of all places. He needs to pick something up from some guy for something. Whatever. Just another unneeded delay on an already lengthy car ride. I just hope Pete and I aren't gonna kill each other by the end of that day.  I'm kinda miffed about how he seems to be perceiving this trip, actually. It's almost like he's going on a trip and i'm just tagging along. Even though i'm paying half the way and we're staying at my uncles place. His whole toy obsession just...overpowers any sense of equality with us. Maybe i'm just paranoid though. The registration he HAS to go to for his convention-exclusive toy set is between 6 and 8:30 pm. He doesn't seem to care whether or not we arrive in Orlando hours before this however. I'm sure that will willingly be spent wandering around talking to other collectors for hours while i stand around being bored and sweating like a cat in a chinese restaurant.  Mah, i'll ditch him and drive around for hours, make HIM wait for ME for a while.  Enough bitterness though. I AM pretty excited about this :D A whole week of fun and sun and drinking and sweating and more drinking and relaxing and more drinking...ahhh it'll be good.  In other news...I'm trying to avoid this former roommate of mine. He's SUCH a pain in the ass. Really. I don't know why i can't get rid of him, or just, you know, tell him to screw off. But, i mean, he's been a "friend" of mine for like 10 years. He's unstable though, mentally, and very...needy...i don't know how he'd react if i told him to leave me alone.  Sigh.  It's tough to be me some days.  That's all for tonight  Signing off

      so.  after about half an hour of dicking around i finally remember my damned password to get on here.  I did the password-recover option like three times and no dice in my email inbox.  I swear there are little gnomes inside my computer that eat incoming mail...this in't the first time i've not gotten emails.     Ugh.   It's bloody hot as hell in this apartment.  I seriously need an airconditioner...or at least a hot girl in a bikini fanning a big block of ice beside me...actually, i think i'd PREFER that one :P  And i think a big moth just flew into my fan...yep, there he is, dangling and dying...ahhh the circle of life.  In other news...  Really looking forward to the 30th of this month...not ONLY is it my birthday, but is also the departure date for Florida.  It's gonna be so much fun.  I think my roommate's parents are insane though.  Initially we were to borrow their van for the drive down...now they've reconsidered and decided it'd be a good idea to  pay  for us to take a rental car down there.  Which, for the record, is prohibitavley expensive.  Yeah.  Like i said,  insane . But, hey, whatever, if they want to pay through the nose for it...so be it.  I don't care, i'm just gonna have a great time in Florida.  I plan on being drunk off my ass at least two nights.  That's all for now folks Signing off

      Over the last month or so i've been working on a submission for Marvel Comics.  The dream, of course, to land me a gig drawing comics for a living.  It's coming along pretty well, when i get motivated...which oddly seems to take some work.  Someday i'll post a link up if i ever get my bloody scanner working again.    Work's also coming along on my other comic related projects...Usually just in the background of my brain.  But on occasion i DO have a flash of inspiration regarding them.  Hopefully in time i'll get the opportunity to tell the world my stories.  That's all i really want.  Signing off.

      Ok...cue the lights   Good evening Ladies and Gentlemen to the inaugural post of Eric's Soapbox Blog.  It is truly an honour to be here writing to you today...that is, of course, assuming there's somebody out there reading this.  If not, then i've wasted a tiny amount of server space holding this blog page in storage.  If there is...then Welcome!  and i hope you enjoy your stay   I'm not sure exactly the kinds of things that i'm supposed to be writing here, and this is sort of a work in progress.  So, if you have any complaints, please feel free to shove them up your @$$.  That'll do for today
