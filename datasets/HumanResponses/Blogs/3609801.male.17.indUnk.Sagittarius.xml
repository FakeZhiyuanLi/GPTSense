       urlLink    ...Just some more random stuff here--while online I read at Yahoo.com's top stories part of their website that it has been confirmed that Britney Spears  is engaged to one of her backup dancers, Kevin Federline. The article went on to say that "...the 22-year-old is ready to walk down the aisle again, but this time she's apparently going to take a more traditional route..." Hopefully her marriage will last longer than her previous 55-hour Las Vegas marriage to childhood friend Jason Alexander... &nbsp; urlLink

       After posting on my website my post-retirement basketball article, I have received numerous challenges from people saying they could take me one-on-one. I have no problem with this, as if you feel the need to challenge me and believe that you possess the skills/game/abilites to defeat me in a game of one-on-one basketball, then don't be shy, I urge you to contact me like numerous people have done.       Also, for those of you who don't know, every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Coventry Elementary has teen/adult nights ran by Rick aka Bankman from 6-9.    And Brandon Ingram...you owe me a dollar from the one game of HORSE I beat you in...

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink    ...By Andrew  ...Wimbledon's number one seed  Roger Federer  crushed Colombian  Alejandro Falla  by a score of 6-1, 6-2, 6-0 on Centre Court early Thursday morning. The defending champion Federer looked impressive in his serves, ground strokes and volleys as he easily defeated the Colombian, losing only 3 games.   ...Overall throughout the first two rounds, Federer has won 36 games and only lost 9...  ...American  Andy Roddick  , seeded second in the presitgious tourney, resumed his first round match earlier this morning with  Yeu-Tzuoo Wang  of Chinese Taipei, and won in straight sets over the inexperienced qualifier from Southeast Asia. However, after watching the two play, Roddick looked less precise in his groundstrokes and his second serve was targeted by Wang, playing in his first Grand Slam match ever. In all actuality, Roddick had more unforced errors, and did not look to be on the top of his game.   ...When asked after the match how he felt he was playing, Roddick responded: "It was tough out there. The wind was swirling. I was not feeling comfortable out there. I feel like there's a lot of room for improvement from today."   Damn straight.

       urlLink    After doing a little research, here's a piece I did on the soon-to-be trade:  The Houston Rockets Get:  Tracy McGrady (6'8, 210 lbs. SG; 28.0 PPG, 6.0 RPG, 5.5 APG) Juwan Howard (6'9, 230 lbs. PF; 17.0 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 2.0 APG) Tyronn Lue (6'0, 178 lbs. PG; 10.5 PPG, 2.5 RPG, 4.2 APG) Reece Gaines (6'6, 205 lbs. PG; 1.8 PPG, 1.0 RPG, 1.1 APG)   The Orlando Magic Get:  Steve Francis (6'3, 195 lbs. PG; 16.6 PPG, 5.5 RPG, 6.2 APG) Cuttino Mobley (6'4, 215 lbs. SG; 15.8 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 3.2 APG) Kelvin Cato (6'11, 275 lbs. C; 6.1 PPG, 6.8 RPG, 1.0 APG)   ...In disecting the statistical aspect of the trade, the Magic lose the number one scorer in the NBA in  Tracy McGrady , along with solid starting power forward  Juwan Howard . For Orlando, the addition into the deal of backup guards  Reece Gaines  and  Tyronn Lue  (Lue did start for the majority of the 03-04 season, but he still is not a quality starter), give the Magic added salary cap room for the large contracts of  Steve Francis  and  Cuttino Mobley .  ...The Rockets get two proven players in McGrady and Howard, and add that to two-time starting All-star center  Yao Ming (7'6, 310 lbs. C; 17.5 PPG, 9.0 RPG, 1.5 APG) , and you have a very respectable frontcourt in Howard and Yao playing alongisde a top-notch scorer in McGrady.   ...Orlando receives two proven guards in Francis and Mobley that especially excel in an isolation offense. This was obvious in the two players' decreasing averages as after their successful years with the iso-offense ended, they struggled in a new offense that Houston head coach Jeff Van Gundy built and focused around the younger, better player in Yao. As Ming was deemed the focal point on offense, it became obvious of the selfishness on offense settling in among Francis and Mobley. Now the two guards are fortunate enough to go to a team that will focus around them and the number one pick Orlando controls. All three players under head coach Johnny Davis will be signifcant contributors, as they will be a major factor in Orlando's rebuilding scheme.  ...One of the biggest downsides, however, to receiving Mobley and Francis is that both players' defense is suspect. Neither player was really able to defensively matchup with the backcourts of other teams in the NBA, and as a result, they were defensively outplayed night-in and night-out.  ...In my opinion, the Rockets come out of this trade as the overall winners, and despite the fact that they dismounted the solid core of Francis, Yao, and Mobley that led them to a playoffs spot in the heavily competitive Western Conference, they still have much to look forward to. The reason for being positive about the future is because of the fact that Houston now receives a proven superstar in Tracy McGrady who can shoot, attack the basket, create plays off the dribble, and finish extremely well at the hoop.   ...With the addition of Howard and 'T-Mac' to play alongside Yao, the Rockets have a decent future ahead in store, and only time will tell of their success...&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Andy Roddick, holding the Runner-Up Trophy after losing to Roger Federer on Sunday...&nbsp; urlLink      By Andrew ...of course   LONDON, ENGLAND --In front of a capacity-filled crowd at Centre Court on Sunday, over 13,000 fans watched as  Roger Federer , the oh-so-dominant Swede, fell to his knees, fists clenched, screaming in utter joy, seconds after hitting his 12th and final ace of the match. Along with owning the title of being the best tennis player in the world, Federer had just obtained his second Wimbledon championship by defeating  Andy Roddick --the brash, outgoing young American in a four set thriller by the score of 4-6, 7-5, 7-6(3), 6-4.   ...In what was considered by many to be the most anticipated match of the tournament, the second-seeded Andy Roddick came out swinging, literally, playing impressively using an all-out attack approach. 'The Yank' employed his entire arsenal of weapons, using his renowned serve, powerful groundstrokes and precisely placed volleys to catch the returning champion off guard. Roddick took almost every opportunity at charging the net and his early strategy paid off, as he was able to take the first set 6-4.   ...All the while, Federer was his calm, usual self, and despite his early troubles he was able to adjust to Roddick's aggressive style. Using beautifully executed baseline winners and dropshots, Federer was able to pull out to an early 4-0 lead in the second set. A rare breakdown by Federer followed however, as he let Roddick pull even at 4-4. Immediately thereafter though, Federer returned to his usual form, winning the second set, and from there on, the champion never looked back. Federer went on to win the next two sets and extended his grass winning streak to 24 straight victories, second most in tennis history only to Bjorn Borg, who won 41 straight grass matches between 1976 and 1980.  ...After losing, Andy wiped away his tears and accepted the runner-up trophy in dignified style with the upmost class. (I was truly impressed with the sportmanship displayed here by Roddick, as I also was with  Serena Williams  after her loss as well.)   ...Following the match Roddick told the media, "Roger just played too good today. I threw the kitchen sink at him, but he went to the bathroom and got a tub," Roddick said. "I'm going to have to start winning some of them to call it a rivalry."   ...Roddick also vented his frustration about losing the Wimbledon final to Roger Federer, partly because it meant missing out on attending the champion's dinner with  Maria Sharapova .   Roddick said he wanted to see what Sharapova wore at the gala.  "Will it be short? Is it going to be long? Disappointed I won't get to see that," Roddick said jokingly. "I might just sneak in and crash the party. I'll bring the beer, man. Let's go."

Later on in the match Serena tried valiantly to attempt a comeback, but it was just "too little, too late," as Sharapova put Williams away with perfectly hit groundstrokes to win the coveted title.    &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Here's some news pertaining to what's really going around in the league...  ...Courtesy of Andrew   It looks as if  Kurt Warner  (pictured above), has the upper-hand in relating to the starting quarterback confrontation with rookie  Eli Manning  in the Big Apple. New York Giants head coach  Tom Coughlin  apparently chose experience over potential and gave the former Super Bowl MVP Warner the starting role in the Giants' preseason opener against Kansas City. (Best of luck to Warner and cast, but it just so happens that his debut as a Giant happens to be on Friday--the 13th...)  ...Also in the Giants' organization, the team was able to see their all-pro tight end,  Jeremy Shockey , the third-year player out of Miami University, officially practice for the first time since he had foot surgery done in June. Although things are looking positive for his return, he is not scheduled to play just yet...  ...Browns starting quarterback  Jeff Garcia  made a statement Thursday saying that a comment by former teammate  Terrell Owens  implying that he is gay was completely untrue and ridiculous. Owens, in a Playboy magazine interview that hits newstands Friday, was asked if he thinks Garcia is gay. Owens responed by saying, "Like my boy tells me: 'If it looks like a rat and smells like a rat, by golly, it is a rat...'"  ...Arizona announced that wide receiver  Anquan Boldin , the 2003 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, underwent athriscopic knee surgery and will spend up to 12 weeks on the injured list. Coach  Dennis Green  initially said an MRI found "a slight tear" in the cartilage and thought Boldin would be able to return within two weeks. But during the procedure, doctors found and repaired a more significant tear, Green said. Boldin's absensce in the Cardinals' starting roster for a majority of the season should serve as a vital blow to any hope of Green running a successful passing game, especially with unexperienced  Josh McCown  holding the reigns as quarterback on offense...  ...Detroit Lion linebacker  Boss Bailey , the former University of Georgia standout, like Boldin, will also miss much of the 2004 season after sustaining a severe knee injury and undergoing recent surgery. As a rookie in 2003, Bailey won the starting job at outside linebacker and was among the team's leaders in defensive snaps played. He finished with one interception and 1.5 sacks overall. Backup  Donte Curry  is expected to replace Bailey in the starting defensive lineup...  ...In notable preseason play, The Atlanta Falcons were destroyed by the Baltimore Ravens Thursday, losing by a score of 24-0. In an attempt to avoid another serious injury in preseason like last year,  Michael Vick  only played during the first drive of the game, tallying up a total number of three plays. During the three snaps Vick took, he handed the ball off twice and dropped back once for a pass--only to be sacked for a loss by Ravens safety Will Demps...  ...After being cut by the Oakland Raiders this week, wide receiver  Tim Brown  was signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, reuniting with former Raider coach,  Tom Gruden . In response to being asked how he felt about being in Tampa Bay, Brown said, "There was only one place for me to play, and that was here..."   urlLink
