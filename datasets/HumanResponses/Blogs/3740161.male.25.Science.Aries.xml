      Well!! the world of computer tecnics in its varying languages and softwares is another world for a doctor.  Yet it has become so familiar with time & need.I learnt a bit of one,then another then another and now yet another.  This time I explore the world of HTML/XHTML/XML to get a clearer understanding of the language of the Blog and its design.It is a bit easier for me,just because I know how to use Frontpage editor,Photoshop quite comfortably and already have 3 published websites and one webpage.  There was a time in school when I was quite well versed in BASIC,C and had ventured into UNIX before I took a turn that lead me into the world of body & disease mechanics.  Now that I have experience in sticking people with needles,suturing up differnt forms of tissue,delivering babies,disease diagnosis, assisting varied operations,seeing patiens recover while seeing some die and also handle a few unforgettable gortesque & messy emergencies...learning the basics of Hyper Text Markup Language shouldn't be that tough!!  Afterall the goal is to know enough so as to understand, manipulate and play around a little to get the results the way  I have visualised it in my head.  With all the help programmes in blogger.com and a few books it should be a cinch i.e with time ,experience and a little work :)

      Just now,I got the urge to play my sport - shuttle badmintton. Since the time I left college after my graduation I haven't played. There is a burning desire and urge within to play.  Since there are no indoor courts nearby and I don't want to battle traffic to get to a game I will have to wait for some more time.  Since the company against whom I play is also very important,I have decided to wait !!! till when ?? I don't know.

      I am reading an amazing book right now. Its called 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.  Its an out of the world experience!!!It has released my mind from the chains of reality and has expanded my thinking in dimensions I would never have done otherwise.It is an awesome journey reading this book !! though it takes a little bit of persistence to stick to reading it.For only a careful reading leads to clear understanding.  Its reality and fantasy in a blend that has teleported me into a dream that feels completely real!!!!

      The world was all about black n white and life went on , slowly u discover color n with it so many different moods n emotions . Life is all colorful , fresh , beautiful, &nbsp;musical, &nbsp;mystical, tasty, fragrant n a lot of other enchanting things. U get intoxicated n enjoy in the bliss n cry in the deep emotional experiences. Life continues. And&nbsp;u &nbsp;start seeing the greys , at first a little here a little there n then slowly everywhere. Life goes on...   Now u are able to see all the shades together n&nbsp;wonder at this masterpiece of&nbsp; creation , the art work, the beauty and -    u are in tears&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;u are laughing   u are&nbsp;destroying&nbsp;&nbsp;and &nbsp; &nbsp;u are also creating  u are cursing&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp; u are also singing in praise  u are full of hatred&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;also very loving  Singly n individally they are all incomplete but as together they hold a different meaning ,   the truth that is Life.

      A few of us college buddies&nbsp;met up for dinner yesterday. Well ! It had been a while. It was fun n wondeful n a bit messy too...   Remembering my former days of glory of being the  Quick Swig &nbsp; n&nbsp;  Blade  , I had a few quick swigs n the rest was nothing like the old days. I was quickly decomissioned into an alternate universe , while the blade part went to sleep n rusted. Well ! I realised I&nbsp;was not the person I&nbsp;used to be. My system did not recognise this lifestyle anymore. And then it was puke mania all the way from hell.   Later&nbsp;I ended up in my freinds place,&nbsp;not forgetting that&nbsp;I was still in this alternate universe of mine&nbsp;. The guys were chatting till 0330 hrs while I slept making gurgling soundz &nbsp;:)    Finally it was morning n the sun was shining bright &nbsp;.i.e&nbsp; if you looked for it amongst the clouds. And I wake up to find the world still here.    After a good breakfast of Masala Upphit , bread butter n jam we chatted some more over hot coffee . This was all really nice.   After which I said my byes n left for home.&nbsp;

      I dont' know what to say. People put so much stress on luck, being lucky or unlucky and in all this talk they forget about the most important thing, the thing that matters the most, that which is in&nbsp;their grasp to manipulate,&nbsp;change, modify,&nbsp;shape, &nbsp;sculpt&nbsp;&nbsp;...&nbsp;  &nbsp;     Luck is a factor for success... I agree, but then so are you !!!      &nbsp;

       urlLink      I always dreamed of having my own personal space, to design with&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;color in whatever way I wanted to. Finally, I got such an oppurtunity and so I did.  &nbsp;  I designed it to the concept of fire&nbsp;&amp; used the shades that appeal to me the most. I am thoroughly pleased with the results.  Here it is,&nbsp;a snapshot of&nbsp; my study space in my room. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  It is sad that&nbsp;much detail&nbsp;has been&nbsp;lost in the process of scanning.For in the print there is good amount of detail in the dark portions &nbsp;that is seen here.  &nbsp;  Also&nbsp;I wanted to capture the scene only &nbsp;in the natural light without use of&nbsp;any&nbsp;fill in flash.  &nbsp;  Its been more than a month since this was taken. Only now did&nbsp;I find the time to post it on my blog.

I am extremly pleased with the photograph, for the mesh in the window has given the snap a truly amazing effect.Unfortunately its not visible in the scan.But it looks awesome in the print, like as if it was  painted on canvas.    My Mom said -  What kind of snap is this?? You can't even see my face..    Only she can make me see things in a way that I could never think of conceiving.      Love U MUM

      It goes like this. Time decides I evolve. Life decides I do it quickly. So, here I am signing the death of a lifstyle as I mourn for a day while I begin the celebrations of my birth in the next few. I go about cleaning up the old and setting up the new. These are powerful moments for me. And by chance I get to meet / talk/ communicate electronically with my true close friends, some related and some unrelated topics- making these few days extremely powerful  while they have no idea of all this happening in my head and the emotions I am feeling. Now all that is left is to talk to one more true friend which chance has forgotten,as I make this Personal Leap (in my mind) and begin.   The past has built me.I build now ,while the future takes its course...

      Everything in existence is so similar and yet they are not.  I can feel it,see it but can't show or explain it to others. Its like two sides of a coin being the same,if you can see them both at the same time all at once...though objectively they are two differnt sides.  All I can do is enjoy this blissful feeling  till it lasts :)

I had not written anything for weeks and did not feel like writing now either.Yet,I sat down opened my book-  My experiments with writing ,took out my parker,filled it with ink and got myself ready;without having any idea why!! I sat wondering- why was it that I couldn't write anymore.All of a sudden BOOM! and I start writing and wrote four pages non-stop. I am quite pleased with the results.

      I am feeling a sense of loss,an emptiness and I am unable to put my finger on it.My mind feels unsettled. I have stopped drifting and the worlds of thoughts are whizzing past me.Suddenly I feel naked & unmoving .There is a sense of death within,but of what?? I don't know.  Well!! its just a feeling and it will pass. Until which I observe passively without changing,without altering the stillness inside and the flow of energy around me...

      I don't consider things occuring in the universe/worlds/dimensions (or) our very own life as random.I don't understand it but I have an analogy-  Let us consider every possible variable in the universe as a particle in common space.Each vibrating at a frequency of its own,moving in its own direction & speed.So,when two particles collide there is an exchange of energy...the frequency of  the vibration changes,so does the speed & probably the direction.That is how events happen in the existence as we know it.So,if somebody could see the whole picture with all the variables with its infinitely different speeds,vibrations &directions then everything in existence is  predictable and can be theorised upon and laws defined.  Since each of us can see only a small part of the picture they seem random.

       urlLink     It is known in short as DRS. I was posted here for a month during my intership. Though Malaria is endemic here none of us acquired the disease, despite the chances being extremely high.  This hill has given me so much just by being there. The walks, the sights, the night treks, the craziness, the times I had here, were truly awesome. Even after my posting had ended, me n some friends ended up in DRS quite often just to hang out or party on the dry lake.  This was a parting shot ( of the hill ) that I took ( from a distance) near the ending of my internship.  I loved this period of my life and grateful to have spent it among freinds like  urlLink Vivek  , Srinivas &amp; Murali .

      I develop a deep gnawing desire for the sense of solitude n inner peace in whose pursuit I hike into the forests. Its 1900 hrs, I am at the centre of all the hub in Bangalore, MG road. I just finished my classes and got out onto the wet streets. So, what do I do ??? I decide to walk.  A walk along the crowded paths, the noise of the vehicles, the shouts of the salesmen, I can clearly hear the people around me speak as they trot along immersed in their own lives. My senses have become acute. I hear a radio playin in a shop, a street urchin crying, honking of vehicles, couples with love in their eyes, another in a tiff, man in dark glasses checkin out the birdies , another waiting for customers in his make shift studio, the chat walla making good buisness, the guy with the corn eagerly warming up the coals to tempt passerbys, roasted groundnuts in a cone of paper sellin like hot cakes, a familiar face ...  I walk ... the world has become naked ... I walk some more ...  Everything changes when it rains - the smoke from all the exhausts looks like the fog in a thick forest, the smell of rain, of coffee, of flowers, of fruits, of chats, of ciggarette smoke, of beedis, of all the different fragrances that people have soaked themselves in ...  It feels like I am watching a movie but I am one of the actors. A movie within a movie...  I look at my watch and it just been 5 minutes ... yet it feels like an eternity ...  It looks like its gonna rain some more. I get to the parking lot and head for home. The roads are muddy, they are in bad shape, and a segment has been closed along the way. I run into a traffic jam. A major bottle neck , takes me an hour to navigate out off. An auto almost runs over my foot, a car nudges me as it overtakes, bikes in front spit muddy water in continous streaks. I get splashed all around by the vehicles plyin along. The battery in my bike is dead. I honk and hear nothing. The indicators won't work. Must be the water. Atleast the headlights are on. Overtaking and safe driving is a different ball game now. The roads are packed. Each tryin to outdo the other. More splashes. Lots of hidden ditches in the pools of water collected. I make my own splashes of slush in the ditches, most of it falling on me.... I am humming a tune....  I reach home ,I smell like the roads outside and I am still humming the tune I heard on MG road...  This is a first - I have no anecdotes to say, no one liners to spit ... A feeling so different and yet so familiar...

       urlLink       Goa trip / year 2000    I am walkin along the beach looking around at all the beautiful scenery; which includes the water thrashing onto rocks in a foamy rush, the wind, the waves, the beach, the heat and all the pretty- scantily clad birds n mermaids :)  Completely engrossed / absorbed in the above mentioned scenery I walk, I trot , steal a few sights and this European with long hair walks past me. Something inside me whispers  turn around dude  .  I look back and Voila ! this is the sight.  Now, its a mad crazy frenzy. I grasp my fully manual Vivitar with a 50 mm lens ( now retired ) take the cap off, bring it to my eye, set the apperture at my fav 8.0, check with the exposure meter and set my shutter speed. All this so I could get a shiloutte shot. And just when this Gentleman was about to disappear out of my view along the bend I take the shot.  Now, I am sure I missed him. I feel bad, I feel sick that I was too slow. I beat myself up for trying all the technical jargon. I put this program in my mind on loop. I think of all the possible time saving tactics I could have employed with my fully manual -      always keep the cap off when there are potential subjects,    keep the camera in a safe setting like 8.0 and 125 or 11.0 and 125 so that atleast there is a photograph, I condemn myself to the planet of retards.      I comeback home after my 3 day trip and get the snaps processed . Well ! I actually got the photograph that I had wanted.  This has made me realize something. Condemn u'rself but don't let it loop . And shoot more aggresively to compensate. hahahaha  I will never change!!! I am critical to others and the same applies to me ... crap!

       urlLink         this photograph surprised me.      What appealed to me when I shot it, was the appearance of the tree swaying to a non-existent wind &amp; there weren't any distractions in the compostion. I never realised the clouds in the background were that homogenous. I just couldn't believe it when I saw the print and I thought the studio guys got the colors wrong. It had a white fluffy background and I had presumed I would get a pale blue .   To me - it looks like a cutout of a tree stuck on a piece of paper and not something shot along a forest path.  To this day it feels unreal and hence has become truly special.

       urlLink        so green and so wet, it was nature at its best.      urlLink  Budangiri Trek ( Jan 2004 )      I was mesmerised by the beauty of colors & the play of light. It was a refreshing sight after a long &amp; tiring hike on an unsure path. It was time to rejoice and remember that it was for sights like these that we had walked into the jungles of Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary.  We were hungry ( had run out of food). We had not seen anyone else since the time we bid our byes to locals at Gaalikere ( Lake of Winds ) and that was 2 days ago. We did not know whether we were going much further into the jungle or were on our path out.     The sanctuary is such that if u get lost u can stay that way for days to weeks ( its that thick ). We mostly hiked on the hills encircling the sanctuary like a horseshoe and once in a while dipping into the thick jungles and cutting across the sholas. We followed many tracks that led to waterholes making us realize that it was not a trail left by humans but were animal trails. Misled by the trails, not having the advantage of height in the valleys & sholas . the direction changing every few steps, the terrain changing every few kilometers . It was only our experience that helped us in making critical decisions.     Such a refreshing sight I was spellbound and forgot all that      was    &amp; all that    can    (be) and breathed only the    now   .  It was such a moment.        It was the Perfect Stream.

       urlLink     Taken during my hike in Dandeli ( Dec 2002 )  I went to this beautiful place with close freinds Srinivas,  urlLink Vivek  &  urlLink Lavannya  . Myself &amp;  urlLink Vivek  had been dreaming of making this trek happen for a long time and finally we did make it come true.  Camping at the Kavala caves was one of my best experiences.  We always plan our trek methodically, with meticulosly done data research , so that we always know what we were doing.    This one was completly different !!! Hardly any concrete research and no game plan. The concept was to plan on the road , to be surprised and take whatever that came along our path.    The trek worked out like a dream. I will tell the story some other time :)  Above u have a snap of a snake skin that we found at the Kavala caves ( held by Srini ). The skin was intact and clearly depicts the features of the snake that shed it .

       urlLink     Lake of Winds ( Gaalikere ) near Bababudangiri ( Jan 2004 )  This was one awesome trek (  urlLink Budangiri trek  ) planned mostly by  urlLink Vivek . Our good freind Ravi who had come down from England joined us on this trek.I was physically unfit for this trek and struggled a bit along the way.  The camping experience at Gaalikere was mindblowing &amp; a nature lovers dream. The snap was taken at sunrise when we scurried up the hill, behind which the sun was rising slowly. It was shouting loudly that it was another day :) and that it would shine bright and make us feel real hot under our collars .  I played around with my camera for sometime and had a good time ( Viv did too ). And we guys packed up as early as possible and cotinued on the next leg of our trek.

       urlLink     I get tired, then bored and I start looking around for some creative distraction. But then one can't go around the world in a flash ( though its possible with TV )  So, I decide to spend 5 minutes with my dear friend, amazing pal & a real good companion ... my camera ... Shut all these days in the cupboard dreaming up pictures ... I give it life once again !!  So, in thought of giving it a breather I take a few snaps of me :)  Come on now !! There weren't any interseting subjects around (if U get my wind) . And since I had not tried any silhoutte shots of myself this was my great chance to do so.  I took a handful of shots over the past few weeks and this is one of them. ( there is another that appears on my blog profile )  The unbelievable fact is that   I  who used to finish a roll in 15 min in a crazed fashion, now shot just two rolls over a period of 2 months. ( most of them being shot in n around the house )  Since I won't be travelling much until the mid-october to mid- november period, photography has rightfully taken the back seat, leavin plenty of space for my academic games n pursuits :)

      I recently took a broadband connection and immediately realised how compromised and vulnerable  my system was !!  I was bulldozed with adwares , spywares and worms. It has taken me an entire evening to figure out ways to make my system secure. It is only now that I can finally enjoy the broadband connection.  All is well that ends well or otherwise, as long as it ends :)

       urlLink     When I went to Kumarparvat ( above ) the very first time, I felt a sense of peace that was totally pure.  It happened in the evening as I sat watching , hearing, sniffing and feeling the continous drizzle, the mist , the humidity ,the temprature and my heart beat. It was as if everything was in sync beating together. I could taste it, feel it ,hear it, see it, smell it all at once. I felt I was dancing to the music of nature.  I never felt that on my 3 other visits to the mountain. I can easily count the number of times this has happened with my fingers. It has happened so few a times.  Today for a moment or so I felt this awesome peace, when I was sitting in the garden watching the rain.  It feels good. It is so blissful. All beating in one rhythm.
