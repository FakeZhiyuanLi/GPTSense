       So yesterday...I had to go to school to get our mace for drum major academy (not band camp mind you :P) but anyways...Kyle had to go to school as well to say goodbye to teachers and what not. So Monday night I talked with Kyle and we decided to meet at the band room around 7:35 (take note of the times) and then I would walk around with him as he talked with teachers. Well 7:35 rolls around...no Kyle. 8:00 rolls around...still no Kyle. At 8:15 I decide to go around and get final grades from my teachers and maybe I would run into Kyle. I was thinking maybe he forgot he said he would meet me. I get my grades and Kyle is still no where to be found. So I end up sitting in the band room, occasionally leaving to see if Kyle was anywhere. But no. So I finally decide to just stay put in the band room. This is at 9:00 now. I sit for 35 minutes and then say to myself "Screw this. I'll walk home." I get outside and realize I live half way across town, so I make the decision to walk to Kyle's house because it is a lot closer. This was at 9:36. I start walking and then decide to call him once I got past Wilcox. And guess who picks up the phone? He says he's going to come pick me up and then hangs up. Well by the time he comes to get me I am already half way to his house. And do you know where he was going to take me? BACK TO SCHOOL! Not what I wanted to hear. I was pissed at the time, but it's ironic and funny that I spent 15-20 minutes walking  away  from school only to have him take me back.       Irony...               ...it sucks.

       Where to begin?....finals are over. Thank God. No more school for Heather. Tuesday I am officially a junior and drum major. Exciting....However...people leave for college in about 2 months. :( Not exciting...sad. Lots of crying in 2 months. I don't know. I'm being weird lately and I don't know why. My world is upside down. I don't even know how to explain that statement. I just feel....not normal...like...um...I don't know. Just weird. Things aren't right, but I'm happy. Nothing is really wrong...I'm just not right. Goodness.... I wish I could understand myself more. Never have been able to, never will be able to. It's an endless battle. Well that's it...I don't know what else to say other than HAPPY BIRTHDAY TAY!!!      byebye

       It's been a little while since I have updated this thing. There's nothing I care to mention except for the fact that my day has sucked. Nothing to do....nothing I  can  do. It sucks. I haven't had a good day in a while. School has been taking up much of my time. And then outside of school I do absolutely nothing. How exciting....you all wish you could have my life. Finals this wednesday, thursday and friday. Graduation Thursday....Tays b-day Friday....what else. Nothing that I can think of....well...with the exception of studying. lots of that will be going on in my house starting tomorrow.        so let me ask something....why do I get pissed off at the little things? I mean....is it really that hard to do what you say you will do? is it really that hard to understand and listen once in awhile? honestly people....am I just asking too much of the world? God forbid people have morals and actually stick to them. God forbid people actually listen without criticizing. I have a mother, I don't need anymore. thanks. I'm feel like I'm trapped. But I am the one who has trapped myself. It's hard to explain and most people wouldn't even understand if it was explainable. I sometimes wish I could just have things a way that would be right. People have gone downhill. We will never be the same as we where hundreds of years ago. Not many people have any morals, and asking certain people to work/try is like asking them to stop breathing. I must have lived in a previous time when people actually had some sort of common sense. I dunno. I am just beginning to get sick of  almost  every person around me. I don't even care what my friends think anymore. I just don't care. There are 2 people in the world right now that could make me happy. One being Kyle....and the other....me.    I am just rambling and I don't even know what I am trying to get across here. It's all just a big blur. I don't know! It's all so frustrating.....And  no one  understands. No one will ever understand. I say I should just give up...but that fails. Maybe I was born to do nothing right. ......

       So...yeah...drama...where do I begin? People say they don't want it and they don't like it, but they constantly start it. They either say something or do something to get someone mad and then it normally gets worse. And people say I change...I am just becoming myself...but little do you realize, you change too. And you happen to be changing an extreme amount. Whatever...    Anyways...onto a MUCH happier topic. Myself and James are next year's drum majors. :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D: can you tell I am very happy and excited? So the bad side of this...I have to go to drum major academy the week before Kyle's graduation party and before I go to see and Nascar race. Part of Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and part of Ssturday I will be in Mass. And then Saturday afternoon/evening I will be at Kyle's party I think. Then the next morning around 4am I will be leaving to go see a Nascar race and will be there all day. Busy busy week/weekend. That is the bad part. I don't mind though. It's worth it.      Back to a sort of negative topic...I'm lonely. And sore. And uncomfortable. And not prepared for finals/the end of school. Too much of a change. It's weird. Everything is weird. Oh well. Going now.

       Reality is starting to kick in a lot more. Graduation is next week, and even though I don't graduate for another two years I am scared. I don't know. I just hate having to do without the things that I love and enjoy. The past year and two months has been the greatest year and two months of my life. I can't think of another time in my life when I was this happy. And to think that the person who brings so much joy and meaning to my life will be leaving Connecticut in less then three months upsets me. The only things I am looking forward to about school next year is band, certain friends, and the fact that I will be closer to graduating. And the thing about band I am looking forward to is I have a chance at being one of the drum majors and I might not even have that. I can bet you all any amount of money that I will always have a count down to the next time that Kyle comes home. Let's hope I can remain the same happy person I am now. It's going to be a lot to deal with not seeing Kyle everyday. I don't know anymore. I just wish I were graduating this year. Half of my best friends, including my boyfriend, are graduating this year and the rest of us (myself and my sophomore best friends) are stuck here for another two years. It sucks to think about. And it's upsetting. I just really hope I am one of the drum majors next year, so I have something to look forward to. Who knows....

My parents were looking at getting new cell phones and starting a family plan. Well...one thing led to another and now the 3 of us have new cell phones. WOO HOO!! It has been such a good day already. It's only going to get better. Today is 1 year and 2 months. :D So, yeah....I'm happy. Very happy. It's been such a good day.

       So...tonight it our lovely concert at Hubbard Park. Yay to going to Hubbard Park. No Yay to playing the same songs for the forth time. I am sick of them, but whatever. One more performance and then it's over. And I get out of going to my aunt's for my little cousin's birthday. But onto a new subject...I have drum major tryouts on Monday and Tuesday. Let's see how that goes. I really want to be drum major, but I will be fine if I don't get it. Not a big deal. But anyways....PERMIT TOMORROW!!!!!!!!!! Finally. My mom decided to take me tomorrow morning. Let's hope I pass. I would feel like an idiot if I didn't. Oh well. We'll find out tomorrow. I can't wait to drive. I really, really want to. But now my mom has a new car and won't let me drive it. Oh, well. Not my lose. I just get to drive with daddy. :D Anyways I have to go now. Time to get ready.

       So I am realizing that school is coming to an end quickly. 3 weeks until school ends. 3 months until Kyle goes away to college. I can't believe it. The best thing in my life is leaving. I know I'll see him and I can call him. I don't know. I guess if you were in my shoes I wouldn't seem  as  needy. I won't say I'm not needy, but I'm not as bad as you all may think I am. I have learned to hold on to what I treasure, because trust me, someone will either try to take it from you or succeed in doing so. I have found love and it feel so nice to have someone love me.      No one cares what I am rambling about so it's not even worth my time. And don't bother asking if I'm ok because most of you will just criticize me in some way or another. And if you do waste your time asking me what's wrong and I don't tell you, don't take it personally. I am a very stubborn person and regardless of whether I talk about my problems with you or not, I'll live. I'm a tough girl. I've dealt with so much already, I'll get past this little problem.      The next couple of days are going to rocky, so try to deal with me. I've started thinking. Wrong thing for me, of all people, to do.

        So, I finally gave in. I am going to go see The Village with Kyle sometime. However...I made a deal with him. I will go see The Village with Kyle if he will go see Princess Diaries 2 with me. Let's just say it's a tough bargain. So that's what's new. Well other than the allergic reaction I have been having for over an hour. Oh! And I will be going to Six Flags w/ the family and Kyle and possibly my cousins in a little over a week. I'm excited. I'll be on the Superman Ride of Steal. Yeah, I'm crazy. I know. Rides are rides, thrills are thrills, excitement is excitement. I love it! One of the best feelings in the world. :D

        I'm writing in this thing even though I have nothing to say.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Let's make small talk...     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Yesterday I finished  Uncle Tom's Cabin . I must say, it is a very good book. I recommend people read it even if they don't have to. Very good book right there. I have moved to doing the short answer questions and essay on the book now. I will also start reading  Beowulf  sometime today. Kyle says it's a good book, and I trust his judgment. I'll read it. After reading  Beowulf  I must move to  Flyboys.  I'm guessing that is a good book too...but who knows. I'll find out though.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   I'm supposed to be going out with Kyle today to some bank and the post office. He hasn't come online or call me yet. So he is either still sleeping or at work. I vote sleeping...but again, who knows.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   So...let's ask everyone who reads this a question and hope they give me their opinions. Kyle wants me to go see The Village with him on Friday. I am going to ask if I should, but before I do that I have to explain myself. I don't watch scary movies...I  can't  watch scary movies. You see...I have an overactive imagination. Even though I know these movies are fiction, my mind doesn't seem to believe it. So, after watching a scary movie I can't fall asleep easily and I have very vivid dreams. Not my idea of fun. So...do I go see this movie? Kyle says yes, my says why not, my sisters laugh. I'm a very indecisive person as you can see. I need to ask people's opinions of stuff before making up my mind.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   I guess I'm going to go now...shower time. Later.

       So...I got home yesterday, but have only been at my house for like a total of 5 hours at the most. After unpacking on Saturday I went to Kyle's. And today I left at 3:15am to go to NH to see a Nascar race and just got home about 30 minutes ago.   &nbsp;  So...DMA...it was fun. I missed Kyle so much and so many things reminded my off him. But other than that and missing my bed and shower, I had a good time. Well minus the pain as well. I sprained my ankle 2 Thursdays ago, so I got to go march and what not 4 days later. That sucked. And I had to climb 5 flights of stairs about 10 times a day for 5 days. Not fun. You'd be surprised what muscles you don't know exist. I found my abs. hehe. I am sooo out of shape. But anyways...I have learned a lot and you all (those in Platt Band next year) are going to hate me. I learned this past week that I am so damn picky and stubborn. I demand perfection, and if I can't have perfection I better habe the next best thing. 0:)   &nbsp;  I'm leaving...I need sleep. Later.

        So today...it's the last full day I have at home this week. I have a decent amount of packing to do. I have a lot of reading I want to get done too, but I know that won't happen. I have to try to stay off my ankle all day, while I pack and find out if I'm missing anything or if I need anything from the store. That isn't going to work...I need to try though. Tomorrow I get to wake up, read, get showered and dressed, read some more, and then it's off to DMA for the rest of the week. I'm excited...I can't wait to get up there and see who I'm rooming with and see what they are having us do. But at the same time, I don't want to go and going seems horrible. I don't want to leave Kyle. I'm not even going to go into that part because of reason kept between us. I'm going to miss him soo much. It's something I have to get used to, you know? Anyways...I should get going. I have things to do.

        So I was thinking...my boyfriend is going off to college in about a month, right? I'm stuck here in Connecticut for another 2 years. Now we are staying together. We love each other soo much and we have plans.&nbsp;Nothing can stop us. So long as we have each other, we'll be fine. Now...why is it everyone has to ask us, and couples like us, what we are going to do about the relationship when people head off to college?&nbsp;And when the answer is "we are staying together" they act like we are fools. Why is that? I'm sorry that you people may not have&nbsp;boyfriends/girlfriends to love or that love you. Is that what the problem is here? I mean...is it really unheard of for people who  LOVE EACH OTHER  to keep the relationship going regardless of the circumstances? Am I just some love-struck fool? I think not, but apparently others believe otherwise. I love Kyle and he loves me. I'll share my thoughts and emotions with the entire world now...I want to marry him and become his wife and have his kids. He is the person I want to grow old with. Now why is it people are going to read this and call me stupid or call me insane or a fool?&nbsp;And some will&nbsp;say "How come people&nbsp;think that they are going to be with their boyfriend/girlfriend forever when this is their first relationship?" and so on. To you people I say, you apparently know nothing. Don't think you do. You have no idea what people are capable of, whether it's loving at a young age or something else unheard of. It blows my mind that you all think you have the right to say what we want to do is wrong or will end horribly. And say it to our faces, might I add.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   It really blows my mind. I don't get it.

       So it's Saturday morning and I have nothing to do. Well, I do. I just don't want to be productive in any way. Waking Kyle up is incredibly hard. I wish I could drive myself to his house and wake him up that way. This phone call crap doesn't work.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  My ankle is feeling a bit better...still sore but what can I expect? Kyle keeps calling me a dork because I&nbsp;hurt myself. I guess in a way he is right...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  DMA is in 3 days. I'm excited, but at the same time, I don't want to be away from Kyle. I missed him so much when he was in Boston and I don't want to leave him. I don't know. I just love him so much and can't stand being away from him.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I don't know what else to say. I have to shower and read and wake Kyle up, but I don't want to get off my ass. I suppose I will go and call Kyle for the third time and then shower and then read. Who knows?

       Don't settle for the one you can live with. Wait for the one you can't live without.                        I've found the one I can't live without.

       Where to begin?         I'm feeling weird. I don't know how to explain it. I kind of want to be left alone, and only speak with or see those I want to speak with or see. I started secluding myself. But I don't know that I want to seclude myself. It's all one big mind game with me. It's impossible to figure out what I truly want right now.      I just want to cry. I need to just walk and think and cry and talk. I need to talk to someone in person. I need to ramble on about all I am thinking. I need someone to hug me as I sit and cry because I realize I don't have my life together. And then I need someone to sit with me when I realize I'm only 16 years old and  haven't even begun to live my life. Writing in this thing isn't helping. I just find more and more that is wrong.        I need Kyle. He seems to be the one person my mind thinks understands. In a sense he is and I need to see him now. If only more of my friends could see what he has seen and could be told all he has been told. Maybe then I would feel that he isn't the only person there for me. I know he isn't, but I am attached and I love him and he understands.   He understands.

       So I almost cried just a minute ago. I can't believe people have graduated and are leaving soon.    I don't want to believe it.    I am going to miss people so much. My love is going to be in another state along with James and John. Tay is going to be in college in CT, but I don't think he will have much time for anything more than school and work. And so I am left very much alone. I have made so many close friends and they are leaving. I do have old friends, but soon we too will go our separate ways. It's sad...

         What's new...                    This weekend...I don't remember what I did this weekend. I believe I went to dinner with Kyle and his family on Friday and then on Saturday I went out to dinner with my family. Not too eventful. Sunday...nothing really happened on Sunday that I can remember.                    Monday I went to Six Flags with my family and Kyle. It was a lot of fun. I got Kyle on the Superman Ride of Steel, the new Batman roller coaster thingy, a wooden roller coaster that was so horrible and painful, and another roller coaster. I win! hehe. I hope he had fun even though I forced him onto rides. :P He also saw his brother there. Kind of ironic. We saw him twice. Once in the water park and then once while we were waiting to get on the Superman Ride of Steel. Oh! And while we were in that same line Laura and I had to pee so bad. Like, it was a matter of peeing our pants in line or booking it to the bathroom. So we got out of line and ran through the line area thingy, through the entrance building, past my father and sister, all the way to the bathroom. We peed so fast and then ran all the way back to where my mother and Kyle were. It took us maybe a minute. We were impressed and my mom and Kyle were very surprised at how quickly we went.                    Ok...now onto yesterday's adventure...Mystic Aquarium. I love that place. It is so great. We saw the sea lion show, which was cool. And we saw lots of frogs and fishys. It was fun. Then we went across the street to the shops that are there and just kind of wandering for awhile. Then drove home, ate at Taco Bell and then drove the last 15 minutes to our home.                     Very, very interesting and fun 2 days. So what else can I say...I need to make a phone call some time soon. And then make other phone calls in about a week or so. But...whatever...                         Oh...and I finished reading Beowulf yesterday. Good book. Very good book. Next I must read Flyboys and then I have to read the bee book thing.

        I'm not sure what you can call this phase in my life, but it isn't the first time I have entered it.          From what people say/write/type, not directly to me be in essence it is directed toward me, I am a bitch, a spoiled brat, I am selfish, unfair, and I apparently have no idea what the fuck I am doing when it comes to anything.          Let me vent, let me ramble on. Let's not just start saying I have no idea what I need to do and how I need to do it.             Goodness people.             I actually know what I want to do with just about everything pertaining to the next 14 years of my life. Trust me. I think I can handle this one task without the input AND criticism of others who have no idea the fullness of my thoughts.               So now that I have completely vented just about every thought that could possibly cause a huge uproar, I'm going to stop now and I won't post another entry for awhile and I probably won't talk to many people for awhile either. So if I completely avoid talking to you, don't take it personally.

       People...you need to realize I vent in my blog. Some things I say are not always meant the way you take them. Ask me about something the next time. Let's not assume and jump to conclusions
