Message: 	  Love is as much of an object as an obsession,  everybody wants it, everybody seeks it, but few  ever achieve it, those who do will cherish it,  be lost in it, and among all, never... never  forget it.  Curtis Judalet"  thank you T, amazing quote and i definitely believe it~~ i have been in and out of love and would like to achieve it finally that one last time with my husband-to-be.

I'm coming out to LA in the next few weeks, so would you like to chat on the net a little? If we have fun there then maybe we could meet up for coffee when I'm in the US - how crazy would that be?! ;o) "  ***yeah... real crazy. >:o   "May 26, 2004 12:55 PM  Subject: hi..  Message: I'm a pool shark and wannbe VC too! wow you  graduated from music school!  Loved the sexy shit and the thoughts were  charming too..! Holla back, let's be friends~  a cowboy" http://www.friendster.com/user.jsp?id=899093  music school??? fucking music school?? ok so maybe i dont have school spirit for CMU but it's NO FUCKING MUSIC SCHOOL~~ i got prestige going there at the LEAST, it's a good fuckin school for business, CS, fuckin engineering~ .... music school? fuck you man, fuck that shit and fuck your 'wannabe VC'- you aint no pool cat o' P-Z if you dont even got your schools right.

Body: 	Sylvia:  ...but maybe it's a retarded message anyway.  On the subject, I can't figure out why men (presumably) would send you messages like "you're so hot!" What is it about your pics that appeal to our prurient interests? hmmm...  Moving right along... the two reasons why I'm writing to you will become apparent in my story.  I was very busy at work with briefs due tomorrow and came across your profile pic, which immediately caught my eye. Being a complete roue, I clicked on it and your other pics. Of course, the pics of you are very easy on the eyes and slightly stressful on the heart, but I especially noticed the "Pisces" beneath the pretty one of the sky. Of course, you're a dreamer... the picture and word make perfect sense! Alright, I know it's illogical to feel some kinship with other Pisceans (is that even a word?), but it encouraged me to read your profile just to see if you were having that same inner turmoil that I can't seem to shake! (Reason .1)  (Reason .2) So, I read your profile. I get to the part where you talk about Halo. My heart quickened. My palms got sweaty. Alright, alright.. just kidding... Seriously, I see that you were a Halo junky, and me thinks, AND she plays Halo?? I freaking LOVE that stupid, mind-numbing, want-to-smash-it-all-to-pieces-when-I-lose game.  So, I know my profile is sparse, but I got tired of what I had written and just erased the whole damn thing! Change is good. Well, if you're interested, I'd be delighted to chat with you every once in a while about anything, everything, or whatever. I'm good like that.  Woefully behind at work, ----"

Then i  hit a road block.  damn it, i love cats.  i mean,  i love dogs too, but i REALLY love cats.  if only  i could make myself love them a little less, i'd  be perfect for you.  oh well.  do you have cat-people as friends, at least?"

      "the interesting thing is to see people when they lose love. How devastated they are; they kind of naturally go into love, but when they lose it, it kind of is like any other addictive drug. It's like they want it back so desperately and they don't know where to go with it." - indie film Dopamine.  What is the difference between LOVE and LOYALTY?

      I hate partying way too hard and wasting the next day spaced out and trying to rehydrate all day and get shit done. My apt is waaay too messy and i haven't done anything to make it look any better. Worse yet, is when people change schedules on you last minute and you gotta adjust. So i've got to work on sunday, tomorrow... yes i know, i have a demanding job, and my boss is changing the meeting time 2 hours later ONLY if the client decides not to call him tonight. So now I've gotta wait around until 11pm tonight to hear from my boss. I could be out watching Shrek 2 or Troy, some shit mainstream movie like that... but no, it's like i'm on call. like a doctor.

With that said, I  will continue my diarrhea of honesty by saying  that I clicked on your page in hopes of finding  more risque photos (of yourself I assume) :-).  I  then started to read your self-description and  found it highly entertaining, hilarious, and  blunt all at the same time.  I really like that.   And yes, I read the whole damn thing.  And yes, I  share almost nothing in common with you...aside  from the fact that I attended a prep school that  can probably best be described at the Exeter of  the West Coast minus the prestige, quality of  education, and presidential alumni.  Oh I like  fine dining too like everyone else.  Shit you  must be a blast and a pain to hang with :-)   Cheers to having the best page on friendster.  It  was nothing remotely close to what I expected  when I clicked on your pic like any predictable  guy would do!  Have a great week, -------"

      His white BMW was the only car on level two. And upon sight of his car I heard it, solid, and to the point. “That BITCH! That fucking BITCH!” he yelled out in the night sky. I came closer and closer to him to hear what else he had to say. “BITCH BITCH BITCH!” he kicked the nearby wall with each word. I got closer to him with each kick. And then finally I was right behind him. “Hey. That’s no way to treat a wall much less a woman.” I calmly said as he turned to see the chillingly familiar voice. “Huh? What the fuck are you doing here!?” He was pissed but confused. "You forgot your phone." "No I didn't." He reached into his breast pocket and felt the toy's presence. "What the fuck do you want you dick?" “You can’t just go around pretending you own everything. You did wrong tonight. You were all wrong.” “What the fuck!?” “Look, just because you dedicate all your time at your job for good money and I dedicate to your yuppie best metallic in cr—” I stopped my self in confusion. An operatic female voice shook my skull. “Now you listen to me you asshole." He gnashed his teeth. I couldn't believe he was going to direct his anger at me. There was something in my sweaty hands that I gripped tightly. He frantically continued his anger. "Who drives what around here? I bet you couldn’t even afford to eat at your own restaurant. You mother fu—” I did it. God let this be your will again. I did it. My ballpoint pen stood erect in his neck, jammed to the left of his Adams apple. He dropped to his knees and looked up at me trying not to drown on his own blood. “Plee—eease,” he gargled. His eyes opened in pure astonishment and then slowly formed into what I would call… “Humility.” He looked at me with the sweetest humble eyes I’ve ever seen from a human because he wanted me to forget every sin he’s ever sinned against man and seek help. He wanted help. He needed help.

      Astonishment.  In reversals and in simple actions poets use astonishment to achieve their chosen aims; this is tragic and agreeable. This happens when someone who is clever but bad (like Sisyphus) is decieved, or someone who is courageous but unjust is defeated. There is no violation of probability in this; as Agathon said, it is probably for many improbable things to happen.  o' to see the look upon one's face when they have been found out!

      I'm fed up with it. I'm losing my humanity. I'm losing my fucking (excuse me) humanity because my intellect goes beyond that of the conditioned human thinking latitude. Everything is objective, and distant. My life is a robotic motion of things to do and see. I am losing my humanity. Recently, I've been thinking more and more about how those homicidal maniacs do it. I'm really starting to understand just how easy it is to lose your humanity to the point where the murder of a human being is like killing a highly intelligent fly. Easy. I've thought about it more than once. I keep thinking about it. I keep thinking about how smart I am, and that if I really put my mind to it, I can kill a man, dispose of the body, and not one person would suspect me. It's that easy. I don't believe I have any enemies, but there are people out there that I don't care for, and I'm pretty sure that they care less about me. What if I did this world a favor and got rid of an asshole of a human being? One less asshole to ruin the remaining resources of this earth. One less asshole I have on my back. I would be doing the world a favor. I have no problem with killing a monkey, and that's what it's like—killing a fucking monkey. -excerpt from How to Live Life by Wise King Solomon, by Ezra

      Tuesday, 08 June 2004    	Flirting?  I've become a bit of a blurker of late. There are reasons for this.  And the reason is flirting. Not my own of course. I've flirted (and still flirt) with certain ladies on -----.com and it's been fun. I've even entertained certain ideas about these people. Not in a dirty, pervy,sexual manner, just sort of 'what would it be like to meet them' sort of way.  Anyway, this is not about me. It's about other people.  Now I always flirt away from the main forum. It's always over private Email. I don't like the idea of other people knowing that I'm flirting. It makes me feel a little uncomfortable.  But in my blurker mode I see that flirting is going on EVERYWHERE! And not just a little bit of flashing eyelashes on the side. Oh no, this is full on, sexual innuendo 'I'd let you do whatever you want' sort of flirting.  It's made me wonder. What does the anonymous nature of the -----.com blogging life change about us. Would these people be the same in real life? What happens when an Uberflirter meets another one? I have this image of really dull people with nothing to say to each other because they only got the bravado through the web.  Maybe it's just me.  ---------------------------> COMMENTS:     	 Comments: 9   menace on 09 June 2004 at 01:11 The people I've met (in real life) from the internet haven't been any more or less dull on average than people I've met by any other means. But I've learnt that occasionally, those who talk about it are doing it. In a dirty, pervy, sexual manner.       Sseraphimm on 09 June 2004 at 11:40 Alot of bloggers/chatroom-ers ARE full of it. all talk, no action. HOWEVER, theer are SOME of us who actually follow through. And yes, in a dirty, pervy, sexual manner...x       pixie_scandinavian_female_leprechaun on 09 June 2004 at 15:19 I guess that depends on the person. Sometimes you say things you wanna do..and sometimes you enjoy the thrill and fucking with somebody else's mind. And when it comes to guys it's not so difficult to do that:)       Joyfularius on 10 June 2004 at 12:28 Maybe people act the way they wish they could in real life on the internet, maybe they are totally themsleves on the internet but not in the real world. And maybe just maybe they're completely open about themsleves because no one is gonna judge them. I think thats true on 20six anyway, cos your blog really is all about your own life, and not anyone elses thoughts about you..... hmm im not sure if that made any sense! Nice blog tho :) Jx       brunettecurlygirl on 10 June 2004 at 14:57 It's easier to be yourself on the internet, noone can see you, noone knows you, so you have no danger of looking daft and if you think another thinks you are daft, you can not deal with that person, or change your user name and become another........ Flirting is good and healthy. I think it is easier on the phone than on the net, but thats just me O)     pog on 11 June 2004 at 15:24 No bcg - it's easier to be nothing like yourself on the internet - see paedophiles grooming children in chatrooms, for instance.    Sammyface on 11 June 2004 at 17:18 1. what's blurking? 2. i flirted lots (in a nice cutey kinda way) with someone on a internet site and it worked out. guess it depends what each person is looking to get out of it!   selfish on 11 June 2004 at 21:52 Sammyface - Blurking is the blog equiv. of lurking. Looking at other people's blogs and not commenting on them.   mark on 13 June 2004 at 21:19 Surely it should be blirting?

       The borderline patient is pictured as having a specific stable pathological personality organization, characterized by a specific kind of underlying structural configuration. It should be noted that the stability here refers to the structural configuration, and not to mood and behavioral fluctuations. The structural configuration is viewed as including a distinct kind of ego and superego functioning, and a distinct pattern of instinctual drive organization. This configuration is quite stable and resistant to change except through intensive psychotherapeutic intervention or with the passage of much time.  The borderline patient is viewed as having one of four structural configurations, within which all patients can be classified diagnostically. Thus, the borderline structural configuration, along with the normal-neurotic, the narcissistic, and the psychotic, provide first-level "structural" diagnoses under which all other descriptive diagnoses fall. Although the structural configuration includes a specific kind of ego and superego functioning, as well as a specific pattern of instinctual drive organization, the focus for diagnostic purposes will be largely on the ego.   Relying on the model of Beres (1956) and Bellak (1958), the borderline patient's ego will be viewed in accordance with the various ego functions. The borderline individual is thus described as having a particular ego structure, consisting of a specific pattern of relative ego strengths and underlying ego weaknesses.   The relative ego strengths are as follows:      * The relative intactness of reality testing;     * The relative intactness of thought processes;     * The relative intactness of interpersonal relations;     * The relative intactness of the adaptation to reality.  It must be stressed that these four strengths are only relative; they easily break down to various degrees in various situations. Because these four relative strengths stand out superficially, they enable the borderline individual to present a fairly "normal" appearance. These relative strengths, particularly the first two, most clearly differentiate the borderline from the more psychotic individual.   The underlying ego weaknesses are as follows:      * The combination of poor impulse control and poor frustration tolerance;     * The proclivity to use primitive ego defenses;     * The syndrome of identity diffusion;     * Affective instability.  In contrast to the strengths, which stand out on a superficial level, these weaknesses only become clearly apparent with in-depth understanding. Except during regressed states, a detailed history or a relationship over time is needed for these weaknesses to clearly emerge. Because these weaknesses are beneath the surface and are not detected superficially, they do not detract from the borderline's appearance of normality. These underlying weaknesses, however, most clearly differentiate the borderline from the more neurotic individual.

      Staring at the sea Will she come?  Is there hope for me After all is said and done Anything at any price All of this for you All the spoils of a wasted life All of this for you All the world has closed her eyes Tired faith all worn and thin For all we could have done And all that could have been  Ocean pulls me close And whispers in my ear The destiny I’ve chose All becoming clear The currents have their say The time is drawing near Washes me away Makes me disappear  I descend from grace In arms of underflow I will take my place In the great below  I can still feel you Even so far away

      so i'm escaping to las vegas. i think i'm ready. living a dichotomy of a life is crazy. at least for me, it is.  -----------> Damon's simple statement pretty much covered it: On the exterior, Vegas is always changing. Inside, however, something about the town was still the same. It was this dichotomy that interested me, because in my mind, xxxxxxx and his friends represented that very dichotomy - the flashy, modernized exterior concealing an inner, dark core. "At its heart," damon continued, "it's all about greed. we build the casinos because we want to take your money. you come here because you want to take our money. the rest is just window dressing - how we lure you in, how you justify it to yourself when you get back home." "but it's not an even game," i said... "the casinos make sure the system is rigged in their favor." Damon laughed. "That's the nature of the motherfucker. it's no different than any other business. you dont open a movie theater and let people in for free. you charge 'em for the entertainment. that's what vegas does. the house's edge is the price of the movie ticket." "But the house doesn't always have an edge," i said, leading. "except with the cheaters," damon said. "and the card counters," i said, hoping he understood the distinction. many casino employees liked to blur the categories together. but legally, there was a difference. it had been tried and won in court numerous times. card counters did not alter the natural outcome of the game, which was a key component of the Nevada legal definition. Nor did proficient counters employ devices to help them beat the house. "Sure," Damon admitted. "The card counters, too. THough that's a more debatable issue." "What do you mean?" i asked. We were getting to the goods the roundabout way. "most people who say they can count cards are full of shit. They end up losing more than the civilians. it takes enormous DISCIPLINE, DEDICATION, and MATHMATICAL SKILL. You got to be a goddamn genius to do it right."  I nodded. "But there are geniuses out there. and sometimes they DO beat the house."  ------------->  it's when you are a genius and people don't think you are that you truly ARE a genius. the calm under pressure. When you go around making them feel like they know you, that they're more genius than you, and think you dont give a shit about learning or being smart, etc, that you've got them fooled. works well if you've got the looks, behavior/acting, suave, to dupe the pit bosses. of course, works anywhere in life. Just let the others keep thinking you're easy to give in, and you've got the cards in playing in your favor.  card counting. word.

      The big mistake that men make is that when they turn thirteen or fourteen and all of a sudden they've reached puberty, they believe that they like women. Actually, you're just horny. It doesn't mean you like women any more at twenty-five, twenty-six, and twenty-seven, than you did at ten.

      ... you are not your job. you are not how much you have in the bank. you are not the contents of your wallet. you are not your khakis. you are not a beautiful and unique snowflake. the things you own end up owning you. self-improvement is masturbation.

      What is the woman species? The female. So beautiful. Curves of wonder. Sheets of curvy silk. Smiles. White teethy smiles. A perfect reflection of God’s happiness in his creation. Candy. The sweet sweet smell of cotton candy playfully lingering around the soft neck of a woman. Hair. Hair so wonderfully produced in a mane of additional silk. Oh delicious breath—breath of a baby. How we love them so, God? How we love them so? So well crafted. Perfect in construction. Perfect in distraction. The Distraction. The face. The body. The soft voice. Femininity. At its best. The soft face of beauty all set there to distract the male, to interrupt him, set the man in love potions for the sole purpose of developing a passion within the heart and the testicles to deposit seed. The distraction for reproduction. Purely for reproduction. Love: well crafted for the well-crafted woman, for the well-crafted sexual organs, for the well-crafted child. All for more humans. The intelligent human with creativity, inspiration, vigor, so easily dispensed when pheromones are circulating. Love: an incredible mind process to draw two overly intelligent creatures together for mating. A sick game. The man; a pawn in God’s world of reproduction. The deceptive queen. Queen of deception. A pity I feel for men. How they boast to be smart and independent all the while overlooking their human instincts. Pawns. All of them. In a game of reproduction.

      I was watching this documentary of the human species and I was particularly educated about the nature of sperm and male competition. If a man has the slightest subconscious inkling that he is the second male chosen for intercourse immediately after another male, his sperm will be of two forms. Some sperm will follow its function and go directly for the ovum for conception. But the sperm of male #2 will locate male #1’s sperm and turn their heads into a corkscrew battering ram, twisting and digging their heads into the occupying sperm, destroying the cytoplasm around that head of the sperm, and thus killing it. No fear to the original occupying sperm, however, because if male #1 believes he is the first to have intercourse with the female, some of his sperm will contort their tails into hooks who will try their best to hook incoming sperm from advancing any further. In summary the semen from each male form not just an impregnation task, but forge an impregnation taskforce, warring for the goal. The very nature of the human is on display for us here: Before we are even given life we are fighting to the death.

      “I make good money and I talk about my life loudly so everyone can hear how interesting it is,” I screamed over the ear-piercing music. The girls looked at me and laughed, quickly catching on to the game. “You’re so funny,” Melody screamed through a laugh. Valerie laughed a horrible fake laugh that worked so well for the mirror. “I’ll suck your dick for five dollars,” she screamed to me. “Sure, sure, sure no problem,” quickly saying something that covered up my near surprise. She must have forgot that I’m a married woman-I mean man. That naturally was typed as “woman.” I must be tired. I’m almost done. “Why don’t we all just go home together,” I laughed as I looked at all three of us in the mirror. We all snapped our heads back in a belly laugh. We blended into the mass of yucky yuppie amazingly. Our vulgar comments went on about yuppie love in every evil form. It was fantabulous. A mirror does not lie.

      There are different manners of talking in places like this that the average low class person is not used to. It’s okay to be new to this. In fact, if you’re new to this I’m glad you haven’t succumbed to their beast-like behavior. Woman #1 and her friend, woman #2 are sitting dead center in the café. A simple sentence would be constructed like this: “Kyle bought her a new car and she still didn’t want to marry him.” The importance of this yuppie statement wasn’t really to stress to her friend that this was a bizarre situation. She cared less about that. Yuppies, affluent young people from around the age of middle twenties to late thirties have a need to hawk statements out so others around can hear the affluence of their friends and family. Let’s go back to the latter quoted sentence. The italicized word “new” would be spoken loudly to let the other cat like women and cute guys around her overhear of her successful position in life. Again, telling her friend about Kyle and the fact that his appeal for marriage was turned down despite the purchase of a new car, is not nearly as important as saying the sentence in the right tone of voice and amplification for other yuppie fucks to hear. The men’s conversations are constructed the same way. What sickens me about men is that their speech pattern mimics that of a woman. Of course yuppie men’s sentences aren’t feminine, but the extravagant way of illustrating a point so the yuppies around him can overhear his successful position in life match the speech pattern of a yuppie woman’s. A man’s sentence would be as follows: “So I bought Kelly the two 187 dollar dresses she tried on and walked out of there feeling like a good guy.” My, how we men can be so sleazy.  This one should be easy to deconstruct. This guy has to tell everyone that he makes good money, and that also he’s a nice guy. Simple, but lets go further. The italicized phrase “two 187” tells everyone around him including his friend that he’s perfectly okay with treating his woman lavishly and yet comfortably. The italicized word “tried,” tells us that he was there being a good guy waiting and shopping, shopping and waiting with his woman; a hell most men barely escape. And because he feels that the yuppies around him still haven’t gotten the message, he drives the point home with the blatant phrase of “feeling like a good guy.” Yes ladies and gentlemen, the ever so haughty statement of “feeling like a good guy.” Makes you want to sacrifice your comfortable seat of reading this, find this “good guy,” walk up to him, stick your finger on the back of your tongue and induce vomiting your coffee and bagel in his lap, brown chunks and all. Oh come on, that’s not as sickening as his life. The human interaction of yuppies constantly reminds me of dogs, monkeys, ravenous creatures discharging pheromones to signal to other beasts that succulent females are ready to be impregnated. Yuppies have this identical form of announcement. Prime women and men hawk their lives to their friends only under this façade so that others around can take notice of who are fit in the pool of sexual reproducers. It’s all the same. Humans are advanced, but that nature of breeding and survival of the fittest screams through us individually, socially, culturally, religiously, and politically. Even in this fine world of braggarts it’s obvious that we are beasts. We are simply higher animals.

						     urlLink Cold Turkey  By Kurt Vonnegut I find it amazing, refreshing and alarming all the same that Vonnegut continues his hyperbolic rampage of making sense of the world and putting things in such blithe, ironic and terrible words. Hail to the chief, indeed.

						    Navigating a new city; or when public transportation succeeds Today I ventured for the first time out on my own into the city, in seek of  urlLink a proper coffee shop . Using  urlLink 511.org's  excellent  urlLink Trip Planner , I was able to plan my route, boarding first the 38 on Geary and then the 23 which took me into the heart of the Mission District.   After I'd logged my five hours of sedentary work and after I'd polished off two large 1/2 and 1/2 coffees, plotting and executing the return trip left me no worse for wear again using the  urlLink Trip Planner . I simply boarded the 23 at Protrero and 20th and stayed on until Turk and Arguello... Practically door to door service! And the return trip brought me to such great heights both literally and figuratively that the 45-minute ride was something of a welcome rest, rather than a boring or tedious excursion.  It's nice to know that all the credit that I gave to BART in choosing to come out here seems to be panning out... and reaffirming my gross suspicions that  urlLink Pittsburgh's transit system  is not only in need of a major overhaul but is actually bringing the city down with it.

						   Having arrived at my new home only two days ago, already I feel the skin from old life sloughing off, like the smog and silt and dust from the previous industrial decades washed off the trees and houses and hills of Pittsburgh. I will be indelibly marked by my time spent there, my time living in Oakland, Squirrel Hill and Highland Park. Surely some of the best and most difficult years of my life unfurled there in the green grass of the spring and the gray slush of winter.   I admit, Pittsburgh and San Francisco are practically on polar opposites ends of the earth, both culturally and physically. Though where I grew up instilled in me a much more North Easterly heritage than Pittsburgh's mid-western presence could ever strive for, nevertheless, Pittsburgh is by lengths a much more Eastern place than Western. And being in one of the most Western cities confirms this.   There's a difference attitude here, present not only in the mild people, but also in the weather. So far I've experienced only sun and mild, high 60's temperatures. In Pittsburgh prior to leaving, we had some of the most beautiful  and  some of the most brutal weather! And, in typical fashion, Pittsburgh sent me off with a gray morning, seemingly resentful and at the same time content to see me go, like a mother watching her first born go off to college. There's a certain pride in the distance and in seeing someone who you knew would someday depart, finally take their leave.  Well I am now a son of Pittsburgh, just as much as I am the son of the Live Free or Die state. What I gained and what I gave up living in Pittsburgh is now mine in totality as I move forward and establish myself anew on a foreign shore. Lest I be too mellow dramatic, I do understand the relativity of my move compared with others, who, for example, choose to travel to entirely new  continents  as part of their pilgrimage. But in traveling within the country in which I was born I have the opportunity to bear witness the stark similarities and subtle differences between the two. If I were venturing off to Africa or Asia or Russia surely it would be easier for me to spot the similarities and distinctions between our cultures on a wider scale than by sticking to familiar soil and having to scrutinize the land for those subtle gems of distinction.  All the same, I have come and am now here, in the city of San Francisco.

						   Things that I recently learned about bike tires:      A tire is made up of an outer shell and an inner tube.     When and if you have a flat, it's typically because the inner tube has been punctured.     It is important to note, however, that all bike tires "breathe" and as such, it is typical to need to pump up mountain bike tires every few days and road bikes even more often     A thorn or other sharp object may puncture the outside "tire" as well as the inner "tube" since the inflated tube presses up against the inside wall of the tire. In which case it will be necessary to replace the tube, even if you only bought it a few days before after incorrectly buying a bike pump thinking that the tire just needed air.    I hope that this information proves didactic for someone.
