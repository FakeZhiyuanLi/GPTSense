      What can I say, it was fant Right, I FINALLY got to watch Troy yesterday!!!! I'll start with my thought on the actors/characters:  ACHILLES (Brad Pitt): I'm not usually a fan of Brad Pitt, but in Troy, he was seriously cool!!! I think he played the arrogant part of Achilles very well, and you just don't think of him anymore as the guy with the "rabid fangirls" on his trail. He seriously became Achilles. The only thing that bothered me a little were the nude scenes, but even those didn't nother me too much because it's not like the movie focused on it. The Achilles stunts were soooooooo awesome too!!! That move with the shields when they all approached crouching, with a wall of shields in front of them, and all the arrows just bouncing off the shields! The best of course was his showdown with Hector!   HECTOR (Eric Bana): Achilles was cool, but Hector was by far the best character in the whole movie!!! Maybe he was on the losing side, but he fought with the honor and he was definitely more of a Prince than Paris. Plus, it was so awesome that even though he was this great soldier, he was also such a caring father and husband. I admired him the most, when he still stood up for paris even though Paris was this huge coward. He broke the "agreement" of no interfering and thus his honor should have been a little smudged, but you just don't think about that because it's so admirable the way he loves his little brother! The showdown with him and Achilles was definitely his best scene. (Actually the showdown was the best scene in the movie I think) I don't know if anyone else noticed, but it's a cool little bonus that his voice was at times similar to Orlando's. The only time I cried in the movie as when Achilles was dragging his body with the chariot. He's definitely my favorite character.  PARIS (Orlando Bloom): He was sooooooooooooo awesome playing the wimp. He looks just as good as he was as Legolas, yeah so he plays the wimp, so what? He did a great job doing it! I was really amd at my friends for insulting him the whole movie and calling him names though, I had to keep reminding them that he was acting and that paris and Orlando are NOT the smae person. The really strange thing is, when I read the Iliad, AGES before I even heard about the movie, he was somehow exactly as I pictured Paris... Orlando really did a fantastic job as Paris, you can tell because people were really ahting him... My favorite scene is (gosh, I love them all) when he challenges Menelaus because you can really tell he's scared but he wants to fight for Helen, and you KNOW he's the coward, but you just can't resist loving him for knowing what he's about to do is certain death. It's really hard as an actor to force yourself to feel both, but I think his best facial expression was when he was clutching Hecotor's knees and this completely terrified, almost traumatized look is on his face, and his nose is bleeding and his leg is injured. Seriously, even to the people who don't like Orlando, he was really really good in this movie. We finally get to see him really act, because in LOTR you couldn't really see that.   HELEN (Diane Kruger): She wasn't awful, or anything, and I'm not saying she's a bad actress. She's not really that bad, but I guess beside all these other fantastic acotrs she's a little on the down side. She's beautiful though, that's very true. I just didn't really believe in her as I did with the other actors. I like it that she stands out in a crowd though, the blonde hair and the white garments I guess, but she really is beautiful.  astic!!!    There's more...here are my favorite scenes:  THE ACHILLES, HECTOR SHOWDOWN That was one of the coolest fight scens I have ever seen!!!! For a while, you actually think maybe Hector can actually be a match for Achilles, but then when Hector starts to get beaten down it gets sadder and sadder and sadder. I started crying when Hector was getting dragged, not because I thought it was brutal (I mean it is, but those things don't make me cry), but because it was such a shameful way for a great warrior to die. The choreography for this scene was excellent though!  PRIAM'S VISIT TO ACHILLES I found it very moving... I loved it when King Priam said, "I have endured what no man has ever endured before... I have kissed the hands of the man who killed my son" or something like that.   THE ATTTACK OF THE MERMADONS The first time the Mermadons are on Trojan soil. That was soo cool!!! The strategy of having all of them sort of make a giant shield out of all their shields put together was so clever. That was really impressive...  THE RETURN OF HECTOR AND PARIS WITH HELEN I thought it was a lovely little scene, with teh parade and the confetti flying all over. Everything was so sunny and bright, and Helen and Paris looked so good together, you could hardly believe that Paris stealing Menelaus's wife was so wrong.   PARIS'S DEFEAT WITH MENELAUS I thought that scene was well done. I was impressed with Orlando's acting... really impressed. That was a seriously challenging scene to act for an actor. Even if you could act, turning your back from the battlefield with a bleeding leg and clinging to your brother's knees with the terrified look of a child who's seen death is a really... really challenging scene in front of thousands of extras (they were obviously not CG). The wrath of Menelaus and the cowardice of Paris were just so well brought out!!!
