      Hello everyone. Justin gave me this website to create a blog. he said it was easier then Xanga and ill understand it better so yeah... These past few days have been pretty fun. Ive had to babysit during the day while my parents are at work but its all good. I dont have to do the whole day cause my cousin is here and she babysits ahlf the time which is fine by me. I went mini golfing with Matt yesterday. It was fun but he cheated!! he kept kicking the ball! and he tried throwing me in the pond. *Tearrr* So yeah. Right now im just sitting around being lazy. Waiting for the phone to charge so i can call Byron back so yeahhh... Then im going to the movies to see Shrek 2 with Maria, Matt, Ryan and i think Mike but im not sure... so yeah that should be fun stuff.   Lisa leaves for the rest of the summer in Paris tomorrow... Im going to miss her sooo much! Weve gone back since the 5th grade!! Weve gotten through some pretty tough shit and shes sooo strong. All the memories weve had.. and shes leaving me all summer. whats with that?? hehe no im kidding, im really happy that things are going good for her and shes happy.. thats all the matters. I love her.  So yeah... Life has been pretty lonely.. I met this guy though.. hes really nice and sweet.. i cant wait to just spend time with him and maybe be more then friends but i doubt it cause im like anti-girlfriend material... oh well.  So far this summer me and Maria have been having the best fucking time!! Hanging out EVERY day and just having fun and being us. Summer times too short to be mature so we said screw it and are just going to live it up and not care what people say or think about it. I LOVE YOU MARIA!!  Matts amazing.. what else can i say?? We have been through soo much together and hes helping me so much its not even funny. i love to just lay around outside on the trampoline and just talk to him about everything and anything. he doesnt care what i say, he just tells me what he thinks but doesnt judge me and thats the best part. I have told him more in the past week then i told anyone in my entire life. and the best part is, im not the only one who tells how i feel. he tells me how hes feeling and everything going on with him too and thats just amazing that someone is willing to open up to me.. thanks matt,  i love you cutie.  well im going to go get a shower, get something to eat, give byron a call and then go to the movies.. ill write more later. leave me comments so i feel loved.  -Tyra
