      Well here we have the writer's dream, and worst nightmare...a blank page.  Since I'm so full of shit, I guess to me it's a dream--I can now share all the crap in my head with the world, and whether or not they notice, I couldn't care less.   Yes, that's nice....  It's 10:24 pm on December 31 here in LA, and I thought I'd write.  Why?  Cause I have no one to talk to.  And why is that?  Cause I am so fucking stupid the world would not believe it.  If you'd like a clue to how goddamned dumb I am just check out my other blog...you'll see the fantasy world where I spend the bulk of my life.  ok, now in the real world, what's up?  The husband I have estranged myself from is with my daughter enjoying New Year's Eve, and the man I love who has no fucking clue I love him even though I have literally done everything except rape him, (oh yeah, I can pick 'em) is out on the town without me.  Because why should he spend it with me?  I don't like him or anything...even though I freaked out just today when he said he might move and I told him that if he did I would commit suicide.  No, that's normal between clients, right?  Why is he so stupid?  Why?  Why do I love him?  I want him more than life itself and I don't even know why.  He makes me laugh, and shit, does he ever make me cry...  Well, enough maudlin crap but I just thought I'd chronicle where I was tonight because the rest of my world would never believe it.  Me, without a date, with nothing but an afghan and some Champagne to get me through the night.  Through the year!

      so you know I'm on a spiritual journey too, right?  And I really want to get God in my life in the best biggest most meaningful way possible, and so I have been searching for a church.  I found an HB church that appealed to me, and today I decided to visit their website, and guess what I found?  Lord, please bless Daniel and his new wife with these characteristics.  Please bless their life together, and keep me out of it.  You know that in the depths of my heart I resist this, but help me to feel these things, help me to believe in them, fully...it's all I can do now.  Sunday October 26, 2003   FOUR CHARACTERISTICS OF A GREAT MARRIAGE  "If I speak in the tongues of men and angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.  If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.  If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.  Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.  It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres…. And now these three remain: faith, hope and love.  But the greatest of these is love."  (I Corinthians 13: 1-7&13)   Why are we having so much trouble in our homes today?  Why are so many marriages failing?  One of the sad and painful realities of our modern-day world is the breakdown of family life and the breakup of so many marriages.  Today's scripture passage presents us with at least four characteristics that create and maintain the bond of love in a marriage they are: Communication:  There needs to be touching in physical ways, social ways, intellectual ways and in spiritual ways.  Then there is courtship:  It is so important to keep the courtship alive.  The third characteristic of a loving marriage is commitment:  This means going into the marriage heart and soul, committed to the love, committed to the relationship, committed to the marriage, committed to each other.  The fourth characteristic of a great marriage is Christ and his church:  How does a couple grow older with grace, honesty, integrity, kindness, justice, truth, morality, compassion, faith, hope, and in love?  The answer is in Christ and in the church.  One of the most beloved hymns of all time is, "Blest Be the Tie That Binds."  Christ is the tie that binds.  He is the One who unites and sustains our hearts in Christian love.  He is the One who enables and empowers us to remain in a happy and fulfilling marriage.  It takes both people in total agreement in order to sustain such a relationship.  As the Apostle Paul said, "And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love.  But the greatest of these is love."   Sincerely,   Peter G. St. Don   Scripture:  "And now these three remain: faith, hope and love.  But the greatest of these is love."  (1 Corinthians 13:13)  Thought:  It takes both people committed to the same principles to keep a marriage alive.  Prayer:  Loving God, You also long to be in a vital relationship with me.  Help me to keep my end open as You are always faithful.  Lord, may my walk with You grow deeper and more meaningful as the years go by.  Amen.   Please remain after the service for a piece of CELEBRATION CAKE with Peter and Rosalind St. Don on this the happy occasion of his (shall we say it?) 57th birthday.

      So I guess this is where I pour out my pain and angst now, eh??  It's better than nothing, I guess.  No one cares but me and that's so sad.

      it's hard, I mean, it's sooo hard to keep it together when I just want to scream to everyone, my heart is broken, people, let me alone!  you know?  I want some time to lick my wounds, I want some space to protect my soul, but I can't have either of those things.  I had Saturday alone, and part of Sunday, and what happened?  Nothing.  Nothing at all.  I wonder if it's possible that Daniel won't get that email.  Do you think it's possible?  I hope so.  I kind of want to pretend it didn't happen, but I don't think I can.  I loved him, more than anyone ever.  I loved him...

      Well, I feel a little better now.  Apparently Ron changed the domain name, and everyone over there has new email addresses.  So, it's fine, he wasn't practicing avoidance on me...  I didn't want to feel like he thought I was a psycho-chick stalker, you know?  Cuz I'm not, in his case, just a heartbroken woman, is all...

      Today I'm sick inside.  I'm so so so sad, and so mad at myself for ever sending that email.  I mean, it was all absolutely true, you know?   But I think it scared him more than I thought it would.  I replied to an email from Steve today that cc'd you, and I just replied "all" and I got a return message from yours--and it was not the same as the one I've been getting from Gustavo.  It read:  "Mail delivery failed: returning message to sender" and included this message: "This message was created automatically by mail delivery software (Exim).  A message that you sent could not be delivered to one or more of its recipients. This is a permanent error. The following address(es) failed:    dan@igecochb.com     SMTP error from remote mailer after RCPT TO: :     host mail-fwd.sbc-webhosting.com [216.173.237.168]:     571 from 207.69.200.25 We do not relay".  I think this is something he created to block me from emailing him.  How could he do that to me?  That makes me mad.  But whatever, whatever it was is over and gone and done and no more.  I'm so sad.  My feelings are really hurt, I mean, I thought he knew me better than that.    I didn't know he would know how to do that, either...but then, he wouldn't.  I just looked up Exim software to see if I could find that message and what I found is not exactly that but it is about relaying, and it has to do with something else, I think--although, I tried emailing Gustavo this afternoon and it went through, so I don't know.  I'm very confused and scared and hurt and angry and very very very fragile.  I'm still in the denial phase of recovery where I refuse to believe that it's over, and sometimes I almost pick up the phone and call him.  I forget that I burned that bridge, you know?

      I miss him, I miss him a lot.  I still find it hard to think that never ever will I speak to him again.  It doesn't sound possible, does it?  But I can't imagine how I could speak to him again, what would we say?  I'm sure it will eventually happen, but I can't see how right now.  On a more positive note, I found a site for literary agents--the lady sounds great and I really think I might send something to her.  We shall see...

      I like it when I blame him, it makes me feel so good for about a second.  He broke my heart....Jeez, who am I kidding?  I broke my heart, I created a vessel for feelings I had no business harboring and set it on a two legged pedestal, then I blame the wind for blowing and knocking it down.   Hey, that's nice.  I think I need to really harness my creativity, I mean, no one writes like me--as Ogden Nash once said, I resemble every famous person in his vice, no matter how heinous, but I only write like me.  I will do something this year, I will create, I feel it.  There is too much inside, too much in fact on this server, in the other blog, to NOT take it and make it into something.  I can write the real life story--they will never know, God knows they'd never read what I wrote.  I'll change it enough.  Yes, I really think that's the ticket....

      I am lonely.  That's the worst of it, sometimes I would call Daniel just to hear his voice and I can't do that any more, and it's really sad.  I am looking at his signature and it breaks my heart.  He's broken my heart.

      I have no where to go.  It's debilitating, the aloneness, the emptiness I feel.  I mean, I told him not to contact me and I know he's as much of a coward as I am but to hear his voice, and it's the same.  How can it be the same?  Nothing is the same.  Everything is empty everything is in vain.  Everything is tainted with the soulless lover's stain.  How can it be the same?  How dare the sun rise?  How dare his life go on when mine feels like it's ended?  Oh God, please get me through it.  Get me to a place where I am okay.  I feel like running away and I want to do it now but I have no place to go.  I have no friends.  He was my only friend, and he is denied me.  It's not fair.  Who can I talk to when the one that I talk to is my enemy? And that includes myself.

      so.  I can't practice denial now...I called from work a minute ago to talk to Gustavo, and guess what?  Daniel answered the phone.  Of course I didn't say anything, yellow belly that I am.  But it nearly killed me.  I may still die, I'm not sure.    What do I do now that I know he's here?  I want to get away....

      it's been a week since I wrote.  I've been practicing denial...to no avail.  Every now & then I have a breakdown--Thursday last week I started crying and had a really hard time stopping, but since then I've been ok.  It's been easier because he's been gone.  When he's back, and I have to really TRY to avoid him, it will be very very difficult.  I don't know when/if that will be.  He's a slippery fellow, you know, and it's quite possible he's run off to Tahiti forever.  I think, honestly, I would prefer that.  Well, you know what a coward I am.  Seriously, a TOTAL coward.  I find myself hoping more and more and believing more and more with each passing day that he won't get that email.  If he had, wouldn't he have contacted me somehow?  I don't know.  I mean, so much of our "relationship" was all in my head that sometimes I find it impossible to separate the reality from the fantasy.  But he did have feelings for me, I know that, I heard it in that call.  Damn him, damn her.  I have given myself to God to make over, but I haven't put forth much effort.  I need to.  It's the only way I will get through this without hate, because I gotta be honest right now, there's hate in my heart.  I hate her, for putting pressure on him.  I hate his brother David for putting ideas in his head.  I hate myself for not speaking sooner.  I hate him for being so blockheaded and sheeplike.  I hate God for taking him away, when I can't see yet what is to come.  I know, that is the ultimate breach of faith, but God understands.  He knows.  And He will forgive me, because that's just me lashing out in my pain.  But do I have that same capacity for forgiveness?  It is killing me inside to feel like I've lost this person who was my soulmate.  I could talk to him about absolutely anything, and it was good.  And now it's gone.  Forever.  Oh, damn, now I'm crying again.  I better go before I lose it altogether.  I just wish the shoe would drop--I wish I would find out that he's gone and never coming back, or that he's back and now I have to find a way to erase him anyway.

      everybody hurts sometimes, every body cries.  But why is it my time again?  What did I do this time?  I don't know.  I always feel like ok, I probably deserve this pain and I'm sure there's some reason but dammit, I'm tired of hurting.  It's so hard.  It's been 3 weeks...only 3 weeks, and there's so much pain and so much hurt and so much water under the bridge and it still hurts so bad.   I'm getting angry...I'm getting mad.  I'm starting to be angry with him.  Is that healing?  Is that the road?  Cause you know my modus operandi is live & let live, and no hard feelings.  But I'm angry now that he thinks all is ok and we can just go on like before, only as strangers.   I can't do that, dammit.  We shared intimacies, and maybe we shouldn't have, if I was committed still and he was beginning a committment, but we still did and I can't forget that.  Can I forgive it?  I don't know.

      it's a crappy day in the neighborhood.  I mean, really.  I avoided Daniel today, until just a moment ago.  He emailed me this morning and I never responded, I didn't feel up to it.  Then, a few minutes ago I realized I needed an update on some freight and I needed to heads-up Steve about a shipment so I sent off a couple of emails.  I don't even want him to email me anymore...I want to be rid of him.  It hurts.  A lot.  And I don't want it to anymore.  Yuck.

      I think maybe I'm insane.  It feels like it, since I always kept everything about Daniel under wraps, the only people who know anything about it are me, Daniel and Tanisha, and Daniel is acting like there's nothing wrong (except of course that he's not actually talking to me) but he's behaving as if we have ALWAYS communicated exclusively by email and it's not weird to him at all.  Well, it's weird to me.  And it makes me feel insane because it makes me feel like the last two years never happened.  Thank God for my blog, or I'd really start to question my sanity, you know?  Thank God I had the ticket stubs...thank God I had the photo of Tige, and the birthday card....  I love him and I don't want to.  I want to stop loving him, can I?

      Another day in hell.  It's become so that we are strangers getting acquainted again over email, with absolutely no contact.  It's not cute...at all.   I accidentally friendlied up an email and got a pretty loquacious return, lots of chatty Cathy-ness.  I am not satisfied.  I cleaned out my area at work today and I now have a Daniel box under my desk.  What to do with the random crap I was holding on to?  I don't know.  There's some of the bottled waters for Tige, his Texas shot glass, the Rangers jack ball, and what else?  Oh yeah....the photo of Tige and the box of cookies he sent me with the free coke cap.  I threw away last year's calendar (finally, I mean, really) and I'm sure there are random ticket stubs here & there that need to go too.  well I just decided to look and guess what I found?  Art Alexakis, Angels/Mariners from September 2002, and the ticket Joe gave us for the Pirates/Angels game in June 2002.  I wonder what I did with the tickets for BB King and George Thorogood?  I should burn the lot of them.  I can't do it.  I mean, I can, but I don't want to, I don't want to act like nothing ever happened.  I am hurting, a lot, and I don't know what to do about it.  There are no bandaids for the heart.  I love him, I love him, and I can't believe it still, I can't believe that we will never be together.  Ever.  It doesn't make any damn sense to me, it's all wrong.  Tanisha said on D Day when I called her, she said, "This is not how it's supposed to happen" and she's right.  It feels so wrong, like I'm in a bad dream, like everyone is speaking a foreign language and I'm supposed to know what they're saying but I don't.  I just realized, I haven't speed dialled Ron's office in 3 weeks.  Can you believe it?  I can't.  That, also, makes no sense to me.    When will I wake up?

      So, today was even worse.  I mean, he was better, he emailed me probably 5 or 6 times, and answered all my questions...but then, he threw in something about Arod.  How could he think that I was ready?  Tanisha thinks he's just missing me, and missing us, and he was craving the good old days and thought he'd try it.  Damn him, I can't do it.  Do you know what I mean?  It's too much to expect me to be able to be with him and not fantasize.  He has no idea how great my love for him is, he has no idea that I cry every time I see his name, every time I see anything I can relate to him.  And that is everything.  He was my best friend, he was my best confidante and it feels as though I've had a limb amputated and I'm having to learn to live with out it.

      Totally threw off my composure, I've been able to think of nothing but him for hours now.  And I'm SO depressed...I need to seek God but I can't, Mike is here and is cramping my style, for lack of a better term.  I am SO depressed, did I mention that?  Even if Daniel and I are able to someday recapture the friendship, he will never be mine and I will always love him.  For my own good I can't rekindle it, you know?  Right?  It's like the addict going back to live in the crack house.  Yeah, right, I'll be able to handle it.  No, I would ALWAYS carry the torch, being especially that I am so good at it.  I would always love him.  I will always love him...I miss him so much.  Oh, lord, it's like he's dead, it's so painful.    God, get me through this night, and I will come to you fully tomorrow.  This week I will commit to going to church!  I will, I will, I will...

      So my weirdness translated itself today.  I received an email from Daniel.  Can you believe it?  I mean, it was work but it still looked very very strange in my inbox, you know?  And he touched on it, just saying that he "sincerely hoped all is well" and he hoped to talk to me soon.  PUH-LEEEZE, you know?    It really threw off my composure, because I was just thinking before I came in & got the email that I was almost ready to talk to him.  I was wrong.  I was DEAD wrong.  I'm nowhere near ready.  I answered him--I was going to make a little joke but talked myself out of "fraternizing" as Tanisha put it, because maybe that would open the gates and if one stupid email makes me insane, what would 3 or 4 do?  Right?  So let's keep it entirely professional, if at all, when we communicate.    It hurts...I have to go home tonight & Mike is there because he's watching Heather tomorrow, and it SUCKS because I could really use some alone/crying time tonight.  Never when I need it, eh?

      I'm feeling weird...I mean, I know that Daniel exited (whoo...I meant to write existed...) and that our "relationship" was all in my head, but sometimes I wonder if he's even a real person.  I mean, you know I had that thing with Bono for like 15 years, so is Daniel realer than that?  I mean, it's been almost 3 weeks since I spoke to him.  Did we ever speak?  Was all of it in my head?  Did I ever see his house?  Did he email me photos of his mom?  Did I meet his brother Brant?  I don't know anymore.  Is Radek real?  What about Brent?  It's fuzzy, and I guess it should remain so, but it makes me really really sad.  I tell myself that it was all in my head but then I remember that the last time he went to Tahiti he brought me back something...that had to have been when he proposed.  So why was he thinking of me?  Why then?  Because he cared.  Why did he hide it all from me?  For the same reason I lied to him about Mike.  We loved each other, dammit, and neither one of us had enough self confidence to allow ourselves to be loved back.  That will haunt me the rest of my natural life.  Will it haunt him?  Does he think of me?  What does he think of me?  I hope it's easy for him.  I was thinking this morning that I never told him he'd be in my prayers, but he is.  I hope he knows that.  That just made me remember when Aunt Dorothy was going in for surgery and I asked him to pray for me, and he said  "you are ALWAYS in my prayers."  God, why?  Why?  You know best, but at least let this poor servant, your pawn, know WHY?  It's not my destiny to know.  I will fulfill my purpose, whatever it may be, and hope that someday I will understand why.  It's all I can do, now.

      I don't have any answers and I don't know if I ever will.  I mean, what can I do, what can I say when my world was thrown completely upside down in the space of about 5 minutes??  I almost literally don't know what end is up.  Where do I fit into his life?  I guess we're simply co-workers now but it doesn't change the fact that I love him, as much now as ever.  He's so freakin' adorable, I can't help it.  He's so willing to be silly with me, he's so willing to be goofy and he does things he knows will make me laugh when I don't want to laugh.  I'm still mad, dammit, but he makes me giggle just like the old days on the phone.  Now it's all email so the personal touch is missing a bit but the idea is there.    Remember how mad at him I was when he signed that first email kind regards?  Oh, wow, I was so mad at how impersonal and stiff and aloof it was.  (did I mention the other day that I realized that aloof rearranged is a fool?) well, those walls are dropped and gone away forever.  I love him lots...and none at all.  I love him with all my heart and all my soul and all my mind and all my body.  And it's all a waste.  Damn him for his impatience.  Damn him for his ignorance.  Damn me for falling in love with him.  God, oh Lord, why did this happen?  What is the purpose of this?  I still feel in my heart of hearts that he & I are meant to be together and I know that's probably denial, I know it's false, but I FEEL it.  Why?  What does our future hold?  Where should I go?  When, if ever, will we be together?

      Dammit indeed.  I never replied to him but I kind of wanted to.  I wanted to tell him, f*ck you, the walls will come down and the phone calls will reign when I stop crying myself to sleep at night, asshole.  I mean, I know he wants it all to be better and of course I want that too but I can't fool myself.  This is too important.  I keep thinking, if I talk to him about my feelings and I ever tell him when I fell in love with him, the moment is this...when we went on the port tour.  It really was...and that was about 4 years ago.  That will scare the crap out of him, but it's true.  I still hate him a little but I love him a lot.  What to do?

      Today I was happy, we emailed a bit but it was not much and not too personal.  Then, I had to ask a personal favor (just to get his job title) and this is what erupted:    Why does he still make me love him when I really don’t want to?  Do you think he’s just trying to make friends because he wants it to be the same?  I’m still fragile & not sure how to take him…because I want it to be one way but I know it’s really the other.

      write when I'm feeling something?  Who am I kidding?  I feel something every minute of every day but it's always different.  today I was happy.  Daniel & I had some great emails and I almost called him but it's not time.  It's too soon, I still love him so much...  I talked to MaLynda today and she was great, she gave me some help and even though I think sometimes I could never benefit from someone else's experience, for God's sake, she has been through the exact same thing.  Can you believe it????  I am NOT alone.  So I may meet her this weekend, to see how she is and see her ring and talk.  I think that's a great idea...  But for Daniel??? I do not know.  And I know enough to say that.  I love him, I will, I love him even though I shouldn't and can't and he doesn't want it, but I do.  I miss him though, I was telling Tanisha today that it ACHES, I mean, I ACHE when I think of how we were.  Oh yeah, the way we were...damn Barbra Streisand.

      I'm very numb...it's weird how I feel.  I spent Friday in contact with him, marginally, but I felt like we'd made a little headway and that maybe we could be friends.  Then, over the weekend I managed to not think of him too much.  I even went to church on Sunday and really enjoyed myself!  We're going back this week too.  So, anyway, that's one positive, right?  I think so.  But then today, I needed information and guess what I got?  nothing.  I mean, nothing.  I emailed 3 times, once in reply to something, once to request documents, and a third--to say nevermind, I got them from someone else.  It hurts that that is what our great friendship was reduced to.  I just got really really teary watching "the men who killed kennedy".  Not in recognition of the loss of a great president, or the waste of Lee Harvey Oswald's life, but no--it was the episode called "the love affair" and it spoke of a woman who now claims to have been lho's mistress during that year, and it was so sweet and so sad to hear her speak of him, and to know how it ended, and to hear her speak now of how her life is in ruins because her family thinks she's insane.  I'm insane too so I can relate.  I too had a sort of affair with a man my family will never believe, and his family will never accept.  Except maybe Brant...  It's a crazy world we live in, isn't it?  (a quick freudian note...I wrote "we lie in")  I'll write I guess when I'm feeling something.  I'm really kinda numb--and that's ok, I asked God to take the pain and if what I get in return is less than exciting, I guess that's ok.  you know it's not how I normally live but maybe it's what I need.

      I'm trying to let the hate drain out of me, and I think it is, but it's all so draining, you know?  I feel so much and then so little, I have no emotional barometer any more.  It's bad.  I feel so sad, it's heavy in my heart.  Today I had a moment because I was holding one of their invoices and he signed it, and I ran my finger across his signature and thought, he touched this, and this may be as close as I will ever get again to him.  And then, I was doing something silly and had to look in "my pictures" to find something, and I ran into Tige.  And I think to myself, all the time, how was it that we were that close and now we're not?  How is that possible?  It's so unreal, so surreal, the clocks are melting everywhere. it's a process, right?  a long slow process.

      Well someone's been practicing avoidance again, hasn't she?  And why?  Because I really don't know what I feel.  It's a tangle inside me that I can't break free, a knot that won't undo, and when I try to grasp a strand it breaks.  So, it's a mess.  I still love Daniel but I feel a lot of hate in my heart.  A lot.  I try to prevail against it but what can I do?  I feel the presence of the Lord in my life in ways I could not even imagine before.  I pray that this will be overcome also.  I do, because I don't want to hate.  But I can never return to the easy friendship I had before.  I realized that last monday--it was SO much fun to write to him and have fun and make believe that we were the same, but for some reason unable to talk on the phone, but Monday, I realized that we are NOT the same and he cannot be the person I want him to be.  I don't even have the right to pretend that he is.  SO, I let go.  And I cry and I hurt and I rage and I tear, but it is what it is and I deal with it.  Right?

      It is indeed a long slow process but for the first time I feel some forward movement.  I've been very relaxed and feeling like it's ok.  I mean, obviously it's not ok but it's not for me to know God's plan so I have to let it go.  We had some nice exchanges, he's getting more comfortable with email, and I'm getting comfortable with him, so it's all good.  Today, Paul delivered our freight!  It was really nice to see him again, you know?  Like old times, like nothing had changed.  Of course it has, but it's nice to visit the past.  I just can't live there.

This would happen even when he had the freight on his truck from the night before.  We, you and I, decided that he should not take you being nice to him for granted.  He thought that he could deliver when he wanted to and not when you needed the freight.  He placed other account in front of us, but more importantly, Titan and I wanted him to understand that there are consequences for his action or lack of action.   I have no problem with him delivering to you if you are happy with his services, but he was not so concerned about Titan's needs and more about his schedule.  With your premission, I will give him more of your freight, but I would like to continue to use JJES to keep Paul humble and working hard for you.  Please let me know.

      I just re-read some of the daniel journal and it hurt me.  I'm crying.  I felt I had to, because today he & I talked and it was so much like old times...I have to remind myself that that man hurt me more than anyone, except for Mark.  But Daniel loves me...and that hurts even more.    Will anyone ever love me again? Or am I out of men?  When I talk to him I'm so happy and then I go home and cry.  That's what I can't take, and I can't make him understand either.  I wrote him a note with his Christmas gifts, telling him that it physically hurts me to talk to him and that I need him to understand that, but he still calls me.  Why?  Because he needs to hear my voice, because he needs me.  I'm trying really hard to understand my life but it's incomprehensible to me that Daniel and I are not meant to be together when we love each other.  When we need each other.  Dammit all.

      It's been so long....I can't believe how long it's been.  And I feel so disconnected from myself, I've been avoiding this.  I have not wanted to write about my feelings or about my situation because it's an ugly situation, it's an ugly way to feel.  I need to get over him, and I can't.  I need to be free of him, and he won't let me go.  I need a life and I refuse to make one for myself, I am needed by no one and that makes me so sad, so very very sad and angry because it's just not right.  My life is not right!  I need to re-commit, I need to get my act together and do something real, you know?  Next week I start my Bible Study class, and I really hope that it gets me in line, gets me into a groove with other people on the same quest.    I really hate Daniel, sometimes, even though he has been a catalyst in my life I hate him and I don't know how to deal with that feeling, with that sense of utter despair that the departure of his fantasy leaves.  I've tried new fantasies, I've tried numbness, I've tried food (and boy does it show!)  I've tried alcohol, which I think I may try again tonight because I'm feeling really sad and lonely and desperate again.  I'm going to copy & paste some of our recent exchanges, and you'll see why I feel like this...I think.  Maybe I'm just deluding myself all over again, in a whole new way.

The met team finished their exam on 01-02-04 and the release and hard copy were received on 01-05-04.  Storage began on 01-02-04 and amounted to $60 per day or $4.00 per 100#s.  We had 4 days of storage which amounted to $240.00.    I do not have any back up, other than our check, and the notes that I took while I confirmed the storage charges. I hope this will be sufficient for you, but please let me know if you need anything else.  Also, Paul will be down with 124 an 37 ( I can't remember if it is 124 pcs?) from Spain by 09:00.

      nothing new today either, always the same old stuff.  I wish I weren't so stupid.  Today, I tried pushing the envelope, so to speak, and talked to Daniel once or twice and we always avoid the subject on the phone and then in emails, we let go.  Well, I said something totally innocently (really, for once) and he came back suggestive, and I carried on, and finally at the end he said something that made me sad, because I told him I was rearranging my to do list.  He said, well, go ahead then, and I got sad.  I said to him, well, there's not much rearranging to do, there's only one thing on it and that is NEVER going to get done.  *sigh*.    He came back and said something really cryptic...he said, well, the thing about to do lists is that things always get done, just maybe not in the order you expect.  What does that mean?  I try not to read into him too much, but he is deep like me and he will couch things in language that is so unreadable, I hate him.  I really hate him for being so much like me sometimes, even though that's why I love him.  My sermon from my bible lesson this week was on connections and relationships, and why we try to connect with other people & things...why indeed, I love that man and I can't have him and so I have turned to God.  Mysterious ways, huh?

      and we continue to dance but I think that now there is a net.  it's called morality...maybe.  I don't know, I love him and I know he loves me.  I had a total, total meltdown last week, I can't believe I didn't write about it--it was a difficult day due to normal pms issues, and then I went home and Good Will Hunting was on.  That movie always gets me, and then at the point where Schuyler asks him to come to California with her, and he won't do it, I lost it completely.  I cired a bit and Heather asked me why, and I told her the basic, you know, I have so much more human experience than you, and when you can relate to something on a personal level it changes everything, and then she asked me, well, what is making her so sad in the movie?  And my answer, without even thinking of it, was "well, she loves Will desperately, right?  And she knows that he loves her back.  But, he's not willing to make the sacrifices necessary...." and right there, the floodgates burst and there I was.  I cried ALL night long, it was horrible.  And Friday, not great either, and then I said something to Daniel about my next interview, and he wrote this email back saying something like, of course I wish you luck but I have very mixed emotions that will be intensified once you get the job... F**K!.  And I saw that, and I really thought, who the hell is he to talk to me about mixed emotions?  I mean, seriously, Who is HE to talk about that?  I of all people understand mixed emotions and dammit, it just set me off again because I don't want him to love me.  Right now, it would be easier for me if he didn't you know, and I need him to quit.  Well, he hasn't and neither have I, but I am trying desperately to turn it over to God because the situation is such a mess, and there is nothing, I mean, nothing I can do that would help.  If he's mine to have, God will give him to me in good time, but if not, not.  And I just need to deal with that.  I have lots of other stuff to work on in my life anyway.  So, that's the update, nothing really new, same old crap.  Daniel, Daniel, Daniel.  I do have lots of new poems, I'll try to work a few in soon.

You know I'm so confused by my feelings for Daniel, and his feelings for me & what it all is supposed to mean.  Then, working on my spirituality and Christianity has me all messed up too, because it tells me that my feelings are all wrong.  Well, it sucks.  I mean, all I want is to be peaceful & happy, and it's virtually impossible for me to imagine that I can be happy without Daniel.  But it appears that God disagrees with me, and I guess I have to go with that, right?  I hate being submissive.  And so, I'm trying but it's a struggle.  I need to let him go, I mean, let him go.  And you know how God tells me to do it?  Well, He got my attention by having a guest speaker at church on Sunday.  Guess where from?  Ft. Worth Texas.  Oh yeah, and the topic?  Well, you know Bevan's been speaking on "Money".  And he did "M"--management.  "O"--ownership.  "N"--need.  "E"-- ENVY.  uh-huh, envy.  Don't tell me God wasn't speaking to me directly, right?  The first words out of the pastor's mouth were definitions of envy, and the first of that he said #10, on the top 10--don't covet someone else's mate.  The topic was supposed to be money but oh yes, get that out there first thing from a Texan.  That should get me listening.  I cried almost the whole time, because God is telling me for real that Daniel's not for me, no matter what I think and no matter what Daniel thinks.  We don't matter to each other in that way, and that is one tough lesson to hear.    My emails to Daniel last week didn't go through, and I don't think they're going through today either because he asked me for something, I sent it, and he has not replied or done the thing I asked for.  So the God of all controls the internet, too!  Good to know.  I must remove myself and not be the destructor, for once.  I can do it, with His help, right?

      so it's been uneventful but morose.  I guess by that I mean that it's been uneventful and I've been morose.  Yesterday, briefly, I contemplated the end.  You know what I mean.   And not really seriously, but I think I'm at a plateau in my transformation, and those suck.  You reach, grasping and gasping for air and with relief in sight at last, you pull yourself up heaving and lay out flat on the rock...then, once you're rested, you look up, and up, and up...no end in sight.  That's where I am right now.  Looking up, and feeling like all the way I've come has gotten me exactly nowhere, and it's a vicious feeling, it's like it's all been a waste.  I'm not happy about feeling like that, I guess I should pray about it but you know what happens to me in situations like that, I feel like it's not such a big deal and I should just deal with it myself and not bother God.  Silly, huh.  But there it is, so I need to get my act together and get on my knees.  I need help now even more than when I was in pain, because apathy and lethargy are my worst enemies.

      I don't know where I am from day to day.  I miss writing to Daniel, I miss feeling like we have that connection but really, if I had kept that up, I would be in far worse shape than I am now, and that is saying a lot.  Look at me!  It's four full months after the end, and still I cry.  I cry because he's not mine, and I cry because I'm not sure he was ever meant to be, and if not, then I cry for all the waste.  And if so, I cry for the loss.  I want him so much and I continue to ask for help, for God to take away my feelings for him, but I resist that taking away because I want to love him.  I really want to.  Of all the men I've ever known I judge him the most worthy and I cannot have him and it makes me really really mad.  I ache with it and that makes me mad because although I know he cares for me and wishes things were different he doesn't ache the way I ache, he doesn't cry the way I cry and I resent that SO much.  I get so passive aggressive with him sometimes now and I hate it because that's not how I want him to know me.  But maybe that's God's plan, to make me so repulsive that Daniel rejects me and then, THEN I will finally bow in humility and shame.  I just want some peace & happiness, and I don't know how to come by it, I know God is the way and only Jesus can bring me there, but there's still loss on that path and there's still pain.  I just wish God's way was my way, I wish that Daniel were mine.

      I miss everything.  I talk to him again, just like the old days, and I forget that it's not the old days because everything is different but he's so able to pretend it's not. and so am I.  and so we do, and so I cry.  Why does everything associated with Daniel make me cry?  Is it supposed to be like this?  I don't think so, but it is and I'm so sad and I don't think he even knows how sad I am.  I think, even though I love talking to him like that, I think I have to stop.  Because it IS different, dammit, and it's not fair of him to let me think it's not.  He said something to me today, he said I owed him something, and it just hurt me a lot.  I said, you know, I would love to see the balance book you keep that account in, if you think   I   owe you anything.  Right?  But he doesn't think like that, he still teases me and talks to me like it's all the same except for every now & then he stops himself.  I hate him for being so able to do that.  Why doesn't he take me seriously?

      I have been avoiding writing like the plague....why?  Because it's so hard to confront the demons, and they are definitely there, and definitely not happy ones.  There are times when it is SO good to be with him again, talking and laughing and hanging out, we go at the debates just like old times, but then I stop and think, it's not old times.  Things are so different, things are so wrong.  And then I cry, again.  And then the next day I wake up and talk to him again and everything is beautiful...for a while, until I realize the actuality of the situation again and then it all goes downhill again.  Life is never easy but when you make the choices I have made, and you make the mistakes I have made, and you continue to live out your own will instead of God's, let me tell you, it's rougher than you thought possible.

      Some things change, and some things don't...that's Tanisha's and my newest motto.  Can you believe it has been over eight months since I lost Daniel?  He's not mine...he's not mine now, he never was and he never will be.  You know that I came to terms with that back in April, I never wrote about it but I had a sort of epiphany and I realized that he and I can never be together, no matter what, and since then we have settled into an easy friendship again.  From time to time, we slip...today we slipped.  There are times when he crowds into my head and I think again, I love him, and then I catch myself and say, no.  No I don't, because way way back in April I tired of the struggle and gave that relationship to God.  And what did God do?  He gave me back one of my best friends on the planet, and for that I am ever grateful.  Yes, he took away my fantasy man, and I miss it.  But I have Daniel's friendship and that means a lot.    And I've been trying to get close to Mike again.  I don't think I love him but I've gotten closer to him, we spend a lot of time with him and it's not too bad.  If that's what is God's plan, I have to make it work, right?  And if Daniel was God's plan for me I think He would have found a way to make him not marry her.  I cannot comprehend Daniel's marriage, I suppose it's not for me to know but I do know that she doesn't live here.  And he doesn't live there.  What are they doing?  How is it working?  I do not know, I cannot understand and I really don't spend a whole lot of time on it.  It's not my business.  All I really know is that the minute I was in serious, debilitating mind altering pain AGAIN, I cried out to my King and said I cannot handle this pain, Lord, do what you must and I will not resist, and the very next day I woke up in peace.  I woke up knowing that Daniel was not mine, but that it was not my problem to worry about and so I haven't since.  I still think of him, I still occasionally wonder "what if" but I don't follow it.  I know that it is the path of the devil and I will not follow him.  I am mostly at peace.  However, having said that, I must admit what prompted me to write tonight.    I saw Spider-Man 2.  The pain of Spidey is my own, I watch him struggle with Mary Jane and I know it is just a movie but my soul cries out in pain to see him give up his dream so he can be a hero.  That feels like what I'm doing.  I feel sometimes like the sacrifice, easy as it was made by Jesus, was so much to ask and if I must live the rest of my life without him that I deserve some sort of heroic memory.  I feel as though I am letting my responsibilities overwhelm my self.  And I get lost, and I feel alone and I feel bitter and angry and soulless, and then I realize that my goal is my God and I come back, but the pain remains.  I remain.  He remains, just not mine.  And I still have to figure out what God wants me to do, and I do not claim to know a second of it.

      Daniel's been a bad bad boy, and he misses me.  I don't want to make this blog about him too, Lord knows there are enough words about that man written on the web already, but...  For about the last month he has been trying to stage a get together.  I mean, like crazy.  "maybe I'll come down to visit"  "I think I need to do some account maintenance"  "come on up and visit" and his latest--Brent is moving, he bought a house.  So, it's now "come help us move" and so on, and so on.  Today, he pressured me so hard, I finally said, I'll say yes if it will shut you up but I am NOT coming.  And he kept on.  So, I said, if Brent calls me and invites me I'll come.  I know that won't happen, Brent is more level headed than either of us. It would be a disaster.  I don't know if I could resist him.  And I know he wants me.  Let me see...  2 parts physical attraction 2 parts mutual admiration 2 parts love 1/2 part misgivings   Yes, I've checked and that is a recipe for disaster.

      oh, and here's another little story...  Once upon a time my friend Cindy & I lived in NY.  We were baseball groupies—we went to all the games of the local minor league team and we loved those boys a lot.  We were in process of leaving our husbands, we’d talked it all out but hadn’t left yet but we were workin’ it out at the clubs.  Anyway, we were at a game one time and decided to hang out back where the boys used to come out after their showers.  We used to see them all the time at the barsnstuff, but we knew this was a night where they weren’t going out (I don’t remember why though).  So, we hung out in my car and waited (stalked) and then when the boys we liked came out we followed them home.  They figured out about half way through that we were following them and tried to shake us, but they couldn’t cuz I had a fast car and I knew the area really well…  So, we got to their place and they went in and we got cold feet, so we were just sitting in the car trying to figure out what to do next.  We were talking and had decided we should just go home, and just as I started up the car a hand came through my roof (I had a sun roof that was open) and in it was two beers…then he leaned in my window and said while you’re staked out you might as well have something to drink…  So we bad girls wound up going inside and having one heck of a night with those guys, we played strip quarters and didn’t get home until 7 am the next morning….

      I have decided that I need to chronicle some of my stories...the stories that make my memories colorful.  I've been thinking a lot about a man named Tory...I met him in Las Vegas about 8 or 9 years ago, and while we were completely platonic, I associate him with one of the most fun times of my life.  The girls from Seattle and I had all gone to Vegas, Leslie, Suzy, Carol, Doki, Fadia and me.  We decided to play a little blackjack and settled at the Imperial Palace, because they had a $3 blackjack table, and while we were feeling lucky we weren't feeling stupid enough to play at a $10 table.  It must have been about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and we settled in and started winning.  Nothing spectacular, but enough to keep us happy.  I don't know when Tory sat down next to me, but it was probably about 7 pm, and by then we'd been there a while.  Fadia, Suzy, Doki and I stayed at that table for 14 hours...yes, you heard right.  And Tory stayed too.  He & I became fast friends, he was from Anaheim and me, Seattle, and the rest is history.  As I said, nothing happened, but I just remember him talking to me all night long, keeping me company with no pressure although it was obvious how we were flirting, he was leaning into me & we both kept whispering in each other's ears.  He was sweet, and cute, and startlingly enough he looked a lot like Daniel.  Surprise, surprise, surprise.  We parted at dawn, and we hugged.  And as I said, there wasn't anything to it, but it was a very very happy memory for me, and I will always remember him, and I wonder sometimes if he remembers me.  Do you think so?  I do.

       Desolation again...I am completely alone next week. How will that be? Mike's out of town, Daniel's on vacation. Guess who I will miss more? I rely on Daniel too much, WAY too much.

       Holy Cow, I can't believe I haven't told this one yet.&nbsp; What has happened to me that suddenly I have no time to write?&nbsp; So, a weekend ago on Friday at 5 pm I got a phone call from the brokerage.&nbsp; I picked it up with my usual savoir faire, and heard a voice from the past.&nbsp; I was like HOLY SH*T who is this?&nbsp; And I realized...it was Brent.&nbsp; Oh yes, Daniel had done what he said he would and had him call me.&nbsp; So I had to kind of promise to be there, because I had promised that if he (Brent) called me I would show up.&nbsp; I hung up the phone and had a mini nervous breakdown.&nbsp; Daniel is working every chance he has to try to see me and here it is, and DAMMIT, I know I am not ready to see him, no matter how ready he may be.&nbsp; So, I struggled for about a minute and had to catch my breath, then I let it go.&nbsp; My place is not with Daniel, even though that's what I want more than anything.&nbsp; It's being made clear to me on a daily basis that God has something else in mind for me, and Daniel it is not.&nbsp; He was the path, not the destination.&nbsp; Oh, what a winding, beautiful and wondrous path he is...I love him still in so many ways but I have to force myself on a daily basis also to release that love as being wrong, no matter how right it may seem.    &nbsp;  It's wrong.&nbsp; I think my place is with Mike, and I just have to deal with it.&nbsp; He's not so bad.&nbsp; I don't love him that way, I will never respect his mind and I wonder how God will make up for that but in the end, I have to follow what I think God wants for me.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; And how can it be right to abandon my family for a married man?&nbsp; Not freakin' very right, so far as I see it.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  It doesn't change the fact that I hear his voice and feel happy.&nbsp; That I spend hours a day thinking of his happiness and how I can affect/effect it.&nbsp; I am a tortured soul, my friend, and the instrument of torture is Daniel.&nbsp;

      I am in such a state of flux, it's amazing I'm not borne away on the tide.  In fact, maybe I am, since I really have no clear where I am or how I got here.    Daniel's been gone all week which has been easier than I would have thought in the old days...but of course now I have no fear of what he's doing when he's gone.  I know where he is, he's with his wife and even though that is hard for me to know the certainty is so much better than the fear.  Fear is the mindkiller.  Anyway, since I spent 5 months in exile from him it helps me now to be grounded and aware of what's going on around me in spite of my anchor being away. * nice twist *  He still is my anchor, I still feel adrift without him but I have begun to come to terms with the fact that maybe I don't love him  that way.   He is special in my heart and I will love him forever but it is so obviously not God's plan for us to be together that I have to learn another way.  And he is my friend, and I respect his opinions more than anyone else I know.  He stimulates my mind in ways that no one, I mean no one else has been able to do, and in that way he is so necessary in my life that even though I wish he'd go away, he won't and I can't let him.  I am so tired of my current life, I need something new and I wait for God's direction but I fear that I will miss it, I guess that's where faith really comes in, huh?  Stay here, go, let Mike move back in?  It's a whirl of nonsense in my head that only God can clarify, and I just pray that he uses English instead of Greek or Hebrew.

      Oh yes, desolation.  I don't know why, I mean, I miss Daniel but the real issue is me.  I am not happy with me, and therefore I seek fulfillment elsewhere, and therefore I am always disappointed.  Dammit.
