      Hi. I'm Dana and I'm an addict.  That's right. I'll admit it.  I'm addicted to this stupid online game called Solitaire Showdown.  (You have to have MSN messanger to play against other people with MSN messanger).  There I was..calmly chatting along with my sister on MSN messanger when all of a sudden this message pops up:  "so and so... has invited you to play SOLITAIRE SHOWDOWN.  Do you accept? or decline?"  So I made the vital mistake of accepting.  My sister and I played for hours.  Literally.  I think it was like two in the morning when finally we were forced to shut the computer down ending our game, due to the lack of motion and thus lubrication of our eyelids which caused them to become glued to our eyeballs.  Not a pretty picture at all!  We decided to meet online every night around 9:30 or 10:00 (well after my kids were in the bed) to play.  Only now I have this problem.  My sister...my only MSN Solitaire Showdown opponent has divorced me.  Well, I guess technically we are "separated" but the little cheater is already "seeing other game opponents."  Only not on MSN.  NOooo...that's not good enough for her anymore.  She has moved on to bigger better things.  My rival?  X-Box!  Hence, I am now putting out a singles ad, in search of a new MSN Solitaire Showdown companion.  So if you have an MSN passport and would like to try this fun and addicting game, please leave me a post, email, or message me! I'm Englishrose7 on MSN!

      Wednesdays and Thursdays are typically what I refer to as my "Avon" days. I usually do a little bit of work every day: hand out some brochures, take a few orders, make some phone calls, etc. My new shipments come in on Wednesdays and so for the most part Wednesdays and Thursdays are devoted to bagging up orders, delivering them, handing out brochures for the upcoming campaign, and hopefully collecting several new orders as well. Not today. Why you ask? It all comes down to a tiny little thing called a tooth. Yes..I said a tooth. Just one. The catch is, it's the one tooth that my 12 month old daughter did not have yesterday but probably will have by tomorrow. Yep...you guessed it. We have "teething troubles." My normally happy-go-lucky, always smiling, never crying, bouncing baby girl has done a 360 into her evil "toothache twin." All day long she has been whiny and grumpy...not wanting to play, eat, or sleep. I picked her up...she cried to be put down. I put her down...she raised her arms to be picked up. The poor kid was miserable! She cried because she was hungry...then because she didn't feel like eating. She cried because she was sleepy, and then because she was in too much pain to sleep. Normally, teething does not affect her this way. She accumulated several teeth that my husband and I have no recollection of. She had two front teeth...then one day she had six! How or when they decided to arrive...we have no idea. However, the tooth she is cutting now is not a regular tooth. No..it's the Tyrannosaurus Tooth...a molar. This tooth makes a grand entrance unlike any other! It is accompanied on it's journey by a mild-mannered fever, and the not-so-dainty diarrhea. These three abhorrent amigos combine to make a very unhappy one year old, which in turn makes for a very unsuccessful Avon Lady day! Guess I'll have to put in some extra hours tomorrow. My husband will be home all weekend! TGIF! Thank God it's Friday? nope Toes Go in First? nope.... THANK GOD I'M FREE!

      Last minute gift buying, Only 2 hours to spare. I have on no makeup, And I haven't brushed my hair. With two little rugrats, It's hard to be neat. Oh, to heck with the touch-ups... I have clock hands to beat! Strapped the kids in their carseats, And we're off like a flash. Thank God for my charge card... I'm all out of cash! We arrive at the department store, And stumble inside. My one-year old is hungry... "COOKIE" she cried! Oh Great! Now her sister, Is wanting one too. As I did through my purse, I hope this lollipop will do. Down the lingerie aisle, Past bras, hose, and thongs... That go in your butt-crack, Oh man! That's just wrong! Past purses and jewelry On our way to the men's clothes. Where after an hour, A warm-up jacket we chose. Finally, we check out... Charge it! I said. Then we wrapped it, delivered it, Ate dinner, and went to bed!

      Well Crap! I just missed my niece's b'day a few days ago and  today (I just discovered) is the 17th of August which is, not so coincidentally, my dad's 50th birthday. I didn't forget. I swear I didn't. Well...not really anyway. I was perfectly clear on when his birthday is...just let it sneak up on me a whole lot sooner than I expected. Luckily, he doesn't get home from work today until 7:30 tonight. So my husband and I have about 4 hours to put our heads together and decide what in the world we get a 50 year old man who eats, sleeps, works, occasionally messes with the computer and frequently plays tennis but has everything he could possible want for that particular sport (and according to my Mom probably shouldn't have bought in the first place!) LOL. My mom and sister got him a cake and a computer game...so that takes care of the eating and computing part. Guess I'm stuck with the tennis. Dang! Now what? My brain is zapped from working on my online Avon ad most of the morning and I now find that I have reverted to "toddler talk." You know... the basic "see spot run" language that my kids understand completely and my husband is irritated by when I use it on him. (Sad thing is..it usually work better on him than the kids!) LOL Any good ...did I mention inexpensive...gift ideas? Come on..I've only got 4 hours!

      Well, here it is. My first attempt at what I only learned of yesterday... blogging.  Stumbled upon a fellow Avon Lady (Birdie)'s blog and was fascinated, so I decided to attempt one of my own.  Though I'm quite certain it won't be nearly as clever as hers, I hope you find it entertaining.  We'll see how often I post entries on this thing.  I'm afraid I am enthralled by many hobbies and activities, but alas there are only 24 hours in a day and most of those are filled with caring for my two precious daughters, doing housework, selling Avon, grocery shopping..etc.  Hopefully this won't suffer the fate of some of my previous hobbies and fall by the wayside.  I'm still learning..so please be patient with me!   God Bless!
