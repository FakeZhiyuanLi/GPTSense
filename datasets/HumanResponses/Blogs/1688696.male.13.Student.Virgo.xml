        "Now that I've seen that on TV that is the shizznat..." Master Shake ATHF      &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Today. Today I woke up to an empty house.&nbsp;Now my&nbsp;alarm today was a bit different than usually. Alyssa called me and that woke me up (better than the radio) and I kind of just wandered&nbsp;around the house.     &nbsp;   Then&nbsp;I realized...there was no one else home. KICKASS! Yeah so I told Alyssa I'd call her back and put Blink on really loud on my big and kinda crappy stereo. Showered, contacts in, the whole deal. Yeah I expected my mom to be home, but eh, nope. Sister was at summer stage camp at the time, dad was at work, and my mom, well she was just not there. I called her cell to see where&nbsp; she was cause it was like 12:00 and she should have been home. She left it at home.     &nbsp;   Next, I called Alyssa back, talked a bit, then she had to go shower or something so she said she'd call me back. So yeah I ordered Papa Johns for lunch. Creepy delivery guy. Anyway so I&nbsp; yeah skipping forward a to avoid boredom.     &nbsp;   At Alyssa's. Alex is there, who is indeed..kickass because she is. We went outside to play cops&nbsp; and robbers but it was basically manhunt. Me and Alex got bored because we didn't know anybody but I did meet this really cool person Katie (Fergy).     &nbsp;   Back at Alyssa's house. Me, Alyssa, and Alex started watching the ring and then Katie joined us. Uhh yeah so we watched I love the 90s and stuff... well anyway stayed there until 11 and now I'm home alone...miss her..later     &nbsp;

       " Your vacuum cleaner at my pants, there was nothing I could do."- Dave Chappelle          Well it's 1:30 in the morning, just about. On the phone with Alyssa. She's over at Emily Townsend's house. Yeah and she says hello. Now my h/s friend Katy keeps IMing me and calling me which would usually bug me but I'm ignoring it I guess. Yeah and again I find myself missing Alyssa. I was supposed to go to the movies today with her and Emily but eh, Emily couldn't go so Alyssa went to Em's house and they might be coming over tomorrow. I hope she does, cause uhh yeah. Anyways she laughed really hard and got herself all dizzy and felt like she was going to blackout and that got me all worried and what-not. Anyway yeah since Alyssa was talking about it, Yellowcard, Ocean Avenue.    There's a place off Ocean Avenue Where I used to sit and talk with you We were both 16 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street  We would walk on the beach in our bare feet We were both 18 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  There's a piece of you that's here with me It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see When I sleep, I dream and it gets me by I can make believe that you're here tonight That you're here tonight  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  I remember the look in your eyes When I told you that this was goodbye You were begging me not tonight Not here, not now We're looking up at the same night sky And keep pretending the sun will not rise  Be together for one more night Somewhere, somehow  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

       Q: What does a blonde say during a porno? A: There I am!!     Eh, I'm bored. Nothing has really happend. Oh but yes I did talk to Pam, Tracey, and Danny/Kristina on the phone for 3 hours, but thats about it. Uhh yeah since there isn't really a song to describe how bored I am...I'll just put a Greenday song. ...How about Good Riddence (Time of your Life)?    Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road.  Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go.  So make the best of this test, and don't ask why.  It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time.   It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right.  I hope you had the time of your life.   So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind.  Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time.  Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial.  For what it's worth, it was worth all the while.   It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.

       Everyone has favorite criminals. Mine are pimps. We can all rob a bank; we can all sell drugs. Being a pimp is a whole other thing.-Chris Rock          Spiderman 2. Seen it once before tonight. I went and saw it with JoJo and Steve also named the Shady Godfather for reason not aloud to be told. Anyway went to the movies, and saw Steve, talked to him for a bit, waiting for JoJo. Waited....no JoJo....waited again....thought we saw her..not JoJo. Then...JOJO! Yeah I had called to see if she was lost or something but then she ran up to Steve hugged him and I said hey and all. Forgot how hot she was but she’s taken and I am too, so not a lot of attraction in that kind of way. Watched movie. Heard Steve and JoJo making out. Kept watching the movie. Then I thought about Alyssa and started to miss her, because she’s in the Pocono’s and all. Then the movie ended. I started singing along with Vindicated, and JoJo I think gave me a look but ah well it doesn't matter. Yeah so we left, waited for my dad. Kind of showed of my car but before that we talked for a bit. Didn't really get a goodbye from JoJo but hell I'll survive. Yeah now I'm home missing Alyssa and drinking red Gatorade. Now the Lyrics from Vindicated:   Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of it has caught my eye  And roped me in So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing I am captivated  {Chorus} I am Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along  And I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intentions Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye  And rendered me  So isoloated, so motivated I am certain now that  {Chorus}  So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away (3x) So let me slip against the current So let me slip away (4x)  {Chorus}  Slight hope It dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption...

       "Alright Brain, you don't like me, and I don't like you. But lets just do this, and I can get back to killing you with beer. "-Homer J. Simpson         Funny isn't it? How summer is so anticipated, and when it arrives, its pure un-concentrated bliss? Yes but it goes to fast and you feel like it was cut short, just short of satisfying. Anyway I think I'll just skip the whole clever writing piece and say it. Summer's hard-core and rules but it's too damn short. School, is not hard core, its horrible and too long. Burn the schools rise up and burn them all, or just fake sick or play some "hockey" (hookey you numb nuts) Well I'm going to go try and make something of this boring summer day, later...rock on. Actually no, I think I'll stay and write something or paste a good song in here. Yeah so here's a kickass song- Tribute:    This is the greatest and best song in the world... Tribute.   Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,  we was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.  All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon... in the middle... of the road.  And he said:  [sung]  "Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your soul." (soul) [spoken]  Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,  and we each said... "Okay."  [sung]  And we played the first thing that came to our heads,  Just so happened to be,  The Best Song in the World, it was The Best Song in the World.   Look into my eyes and it's easy to see  One and one make two, two and one make three,  It was destiny.  Once every hundred-thousand years or so,  When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow  And the grass doth grow...   Needless to say, the beast was stunned.  Whip-crack went his schwumpy tail,  And the beast was done.  He asked us: "(snort) Be you angels?"  And we said, "Nay. We are but men."  Rock!  Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah,  Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!   This is not The Greatest Song in the World, no.  This is just a tribute.  Couldn't remember The Greatest Song in the World, no, no.  This is a tribute, oh, to The Greatest Song in the World,  All right! It was The Greatest Song in the World,  All right! It was the best muthafuckin' song the greatest song in the world.  [2-part skat]  [spoken]  And the peculiar thing is this my friends:  the song we sang on that fateful night it didn't actually sound  anything like this song.  [sung]  This is just a tribute! You gotta believe me!  And I wish you were there! Just a matter of opinion.  Ah, fuck! Good God, God lovin',  So surprised to find you can't stop it.  [skat]  All right! All right!

       "I can take you all in my bed right fucking now....but your not invited, Mark" Tom (Mark, Tom, &amp; Travis show)        Why hello there everyone. I'm on the phone with Alyssa at the moment. She's kind of ignoring me. Like I'll be asking her something and I'll get no answer. Anyway this is about Retro Nintendo, so I'll get to that now.  Ok, as you might have read earlier, I got a new bookshelf thing. Well my mom and dad did. So I had to help them move it to the upstairs, where an old cabinet thinger was. Well I had been looking for the rest of the old Nintendo games for almost a year. I pulled the drawers open. I found the games! And I got really happy and such. So I played a few. I'll list all the games.  Punch-Out! TigerHeli Kung-Fu Baseball SuperMario 1,2,3 Giromite Duck Hunt RaceCar! TopGun er.. I don't remember any more....  Anyways so yeah I found the games and I'm not really..but still kind of being ignored by Alyssa on the phone so, I'll write again tomorrow..Later

       " It's on like Donkey Kong Biiiatch!" Stifler (American Wedding)        I can hear heaven...because I'm going to die of boredom. I suppose I could just go outside and play basketball by myself or try and hang out with my sister and her friends. Fuck no I want to do something fun. I want to go to the beach with Craig and look at chicks. I want to hang with Alyssa and.....uh...do stuff. I want to go to mall and chill and buy stuff. I want to get my guitar. I want to go to boarder line. I want to go to the movies and see The Village, I Robot, Anchorman..something! I'm bored so much that even writing seems fun. Anyway lets see what I did today.  Woke up to my sister and Sara (my neighbor) looking at me. Sara was actually laying next to me in my bed, but it was still annoying. So I decided I'll wake up. Showered, dressed, etc. My mom and dad brought home a new bookshelf thingy. So I had to help them move it in to the house. Fun shit right there, let me tell you.  Then I got online and talked to Alyssa and Alex and everyone. I got bored of that and watched the X-Games. Got bored of that and decided to skate. Alyssa called me while I was skating, so I talked to her and skated. I tried to ollie over a push cart but it was too high. I hurt my legs. Haha, I got hurt. Then I got an idea.  Yes and then I had the idea of skating off my roof. But In the act of setting up the ladder I was yelled at so...no dice. But I did manage to hurt my collar bone when I did a kickflip and landed wrong and the the board come and crack into my bone. Now it's all sore. Ok I'm bored of writing for now. I'll post more later. Later gators

       "Love is like a snow mobile that has flipped and pinned you down. And then the snow weasels come." Matt Groening    I'm so bored...Alyssa is in the Poconos..and I'm not. Wow it's been a long time since I've even written in this thing. I have that habit. I always start a blog and always abandon it. Anyway what have I been up to. I'll get you up to speed.  Ok. So I finally decided to do football again. Therefore I got my cleats, practice jersey, mouthguard, etc. Yeah also my mom bought me $200 of clothes from Pac Sun. We got a $100 gift card back because of some reward thing. Like $25 back for every $50 you spend. Which was cool...moving on.  I was going to go to the shore with Craig on Thursday...but alas he left earlier than expected, so I couldn't go. Instead I went to my friend Lauren's surprise birthday party at the Palace. Me and about...15-20 girls...woohoo. Some of them were decent, a few hot, a few..just plain..eww. So we bowled, ate pizza, etc. Technically I didn't eat my pizza and I was called anorexic (sp?) and then we bowled again..and then I ate something....a sundae with oreos, M&amp;Ms, gummyworms, and marshmallows..mmm mmm bitch.  Oh yeah. This what I got from Pac Sun for 200 and some dollars: Independent Jeans: $50 Vans mechanic jacket: $60 Quik Silver Sweatshirt: $54 Belt: $13 BAM buckle: $20 Hacky Sack: $4  That proves...Pac Sun is a fucking expensive store..but they got kickass clothes. I went there to also get a pair of Bucky Lasek shoes but they didn't have the right color, so I order them form Vans.com, and they're coming Monday or Tuesday..I have fucking size 14 feet! Oh...here's the link to see them if you want:  urlLink http://www.progolf.com/product/index.jsp?productId=1762441   I would have gotten the Vans.com link but vans isn't loading at the moment so use that one..reatarded vans website always does this... I think that's about all that's really happened since I last wrote. Other than that I've been just sitting around, skating, sleeping. Anyway I'm going to call Alyssa or someone now so, later.
