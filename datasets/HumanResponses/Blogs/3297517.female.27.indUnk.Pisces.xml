      Well I have totally been flaking on my poor story this week...its my same issue with beginning it and then not getting past a few pages.  But I made myself write some more of it so I could remember that I really do enjoy making a story.  I think if I go too long without writing I kind of lose interest in it and stop caring about the characters..I just gotta force myself to write at least every few days so that when I get a nice big chunk of time I can maybe get a lot further into the story..the newest part of the story is at the bottom of this post.  Let's see what else...I got some BEAUTIFUL roses from my mom and sis for graduation.  Its been a long 10 years of part time school and work and a break in between but I finally have a bachelor's degree and I'm very very proud of myself for not giving up.  Tuesday was my last class.  I may go back in a couple years for a teaching credential but I don't know and right now I just really need to be done with school and start my real life!  AND I have an interview on Monday so *fingers crossed* hope it goes well!  I'm excited about it..and dammit I'll get my hopes up if I want to!    Finally Mindy began to speak again. "Well you know I had that conference in Las Vegas..."  Of course he did.  Mindy was a real estate agent and she often went on business trips.  This last one was to the famous Sin City.  While he had been sure to warn her against staying up all night gambling and downing too many free drinks..even made a few jokes (or he had thought they were jokes at the time) about strippers.  Turns out it wasn't the strippers he needed to worry about...apparently what he should have been warning her against were sneaky ex-boyfriends.  Mindy continued to speak.  "I never in a million years thought I would ever see Randall again..you know things didn't end on the best of terms."  Heh yah he did..quite a few times he'd heard the heart-wrenching story of the man who broke Mindy's heart by not being willing to marry her three years ago.  Glancing at the white platinum band around Mindy's left ring finger, David tried again to swallow the idea that Randall obviously had a very big change of heart.  He raised one eyebrow, signaling Mindy to continue, fighting his instinct to run far, far away as fast as possible.  It was torture but he knew he needed to hear the entire story before he could ever hope to get past it.

      I wanted to post the rest of what I've written so far..why I'm not sure but even if no one reads this I still enjoy posting it.  I like having my own journalish web page...hopefully in the next few days I can write about other stuff besidse my wanna be book.  But for now I'm just enjoying adding what I can to my story and hoping it's something I can continue to work at...  Anyway he was sure she was only asking because it was the expected thing to do.  Typical woman - break your heart one minute and the next she'll still try to mother you.    David shook himself out of his reverie and managed to focus on Mindy.  "David?"  She looked at him beseechingly as if begging him to make this easy on her. While he wanted nothing more then to cut into her with biting sarcasm and express every ounce of the anger that was beginning to boil in his veins, he knew letting that demon loose right now would bring nothing but a guilty conscience later.  He took a deep breath and in a tightly controlled voice managed to ask "How did this happen?"  Mindy's eyes dropped to the ground and she dug her toes into the ground like an errant schoolgirl. David crossed his arms over his chest and waited while she appeared to gather her thoughts.  After taking a deep breath, she raised her eyes to David’s and blew her hair out of her face.  He had once found the trait endearing.  Now he saw it as a stalling method and just wanted to shake her into explaining herself.  David tapped his foot and continued to glare at Mindy, daring her to say something...anything...that would somehow make everything normal again.  He couldn’t believe how much his life had changed in the last 15 minutes.  Just an hour ago, he had been dutifully writing out his guest list for their wedding and now..he could hardly stand to even think it...she had run off and eloped with someone else.  He couldn’t even comprehend her betrayal, let alone be willing to accept whatever explanation she could possibly come up with.

      Okay!  So I've been asked to make the effort to actually write my book...I have a bad habit of starting but not following through with it.  I've read so many romance novels in my life that the style shouldn't be too hard for me to do..but coming up with a decent storyline is the hard part.  I figure for now I'll just keep writing and the story will kind of write itself?  Maybe?  And then I can add stuff in later.  I counted the number of words in a paperback and it seems to be about 200 words a page..unless there's like massive dialog (another big part of romance books i've noticed).  That means I'm about 1 1/4 pages into my book..lol only 300 or so more to go!  So here's the next part I've written...  He abruptly tuned back into the words that had torn his world apart just seconds ago.  “And tomorrow I’ll be by to get the rest of my stuff…and then me and Randall are off to the Caymans for our honeymoon.”  His fiancee’s..make that ex-fiancee’s… blue eyes were big in her pixie face.  It was what he had noticed first when his own dark eyes had passed over her face at his sister’s wedding.  Mindy had caught his attention when he glanced over the other guests and noticed those big blue eyes tearing up as his sister and her husband exchanged their vows.  Now those same eyes that had captivated him were watching him with remorse and a vague sense of desperation to be done with the conversation.  “David? Are you alright?”  From some place far away David heard her but couldn’t quite comprehend that she would even ask.   Maybe I'll write some more today..its kinda fun making up characters that can do whatever you want them to do.  If I can just get a bunch of pages done I'll feel I have no choice but to keep working on it.  Besides with all the changes that are about to happen in the next couple months I could really use the diversion!!

      My very first post...and I was just thinking about the book I've been reading and how boring it is..and how since I have a decent vocabulary, I should be able to write a romance book at least as interesting.  And then I can get published...of course I've never been able to write a story longer then a couple pages so a book might be a *bit* of a stretch..but why the hell not.  Everything in my life is gonna be craziness shortly..why not throw in writing a book too!    Okay here we go... What was that word..that one they used to describe when a man felt like every drop of testosterone had been drained from his body, when the woman he had planned to love forever castrated him with the blade of her deception, when every hope he had for the future slipped down the drain of infidelity..what was it again?  oh yah..emasculated...meaning to "deprive of masculine vigor".  It may have been since high school since he'd heard it but at this moment no other word was more fitting and it had stuck in his head because he was so sure it would never happen to him.

      Oookay been a little while since I wrote in here but I'm back!  Yay I know you missed me!  ;)  So Memorial Day weekend was great.  I went down to San Luis Obispo County to visit my mom and sister, Kate, and one of my best friends, Jacqui, and it was such a great time!  Reminded me a little of what it's like to have a life...lol they're kinda fun! My sister's roommate put together a bbq the first night and had a few people over..we just drank beers and ate and had a good time.  Then on Monday Kate, her friend, and me and Jacqui went to the beach to lay out for a bit.  Jacqui and I left after a couple hours but when we got back into town found out her bf was going to play volleyball on the beach..so we headed back out and had Kate and her friend meet us and we played beach volleyball for the afternoon!  It was so much fun..though apparently beach volleyball is an excellent workout for your ass lol.  I was quite sore the next day!  Then I drove back up on Tuesday and the whole weekend was just perfect.  I couldn't have asked for a better time!  Alright now to see if I can continue on with my story....  Mindy took a few deep breaths, in through the nose and out through the mouth, as if gathering her strength.  He had seen her do it often enough in stressful situations and knew it was a tool she had picked up in one of her yoga classes.  Whenever life started to get overwhelming, Mindy would take a minute to "center herself".  David began tapping his foot in a rather fast tempo, perhaps hoping that the fast pace would quicken her centering so he could finish this conversation and get the hell out of there.  Finally she began speaking again.  "Well it all happened so quickly.."  He'd say!  She left an engaged woman and came back three days later a married woman..just not to the man she had been engaged to when she left.  The irony was not lost on David.  "I walked into the conference room and had just sat down when I heard someone call my name in a hushed tone.  I looked up and there was Randall...looking at me like I was an angel."  David couldn't help the snort that escaped, but kept his mouth shut when she gave him a half exasperated half guilty look.  "Obviously I know how much he broke my heart back then and trust me I was in no rush to forgive him."  Mindy must've thought his snort was in reference to how quickly she changed her mind, and while that in itself was unbelievable, calling Mindy an angel was what had actually prompted his response.  Mindy was smart, beautiful...and could be kind of ruthless when she needed to be.  Angel was not the first word he would use to describe her....in fact she was probably closer to devilish.  But he let her continue.  "He sat down next to me and would not leave until I would hear him out.  So I agreed to get coffee with him after the conference.  He told me that losing me was the biggest mistake he ever made but by the time he realized it, six months had passed and I was already in a relationship with you and he didn't feel it was his place to interfere.  He had even picked a ring out for me but was so worried that I would hate him more if he tried to break us up that he just kept it with him at all times and dreamed of the day that he could offer it to me."  Alright thats all I've got for now..its kinda funny cuz I'll want to write more but then think I won't be able to come up with anything..but then when I start actually writing it just flows.  Let's hope that continues once I'm done with this intro conversation...moving into other situations will be interesting.

      Forgot to add this latest part i wrote a little bit ago...things are busy right now..or are about to be anyway so i haven't been writing much. hopefully i'll get back into it later when things are all chill!  "That day apparently coincided with your business trip?"  David heard the trace of suspicion coloring his voice and apparently Mindy heard it too.  She looked at him as if he had just suggested she had bought her clothes at Wal-Mart.  "It wasn't planned David.  God dammit do you really think I've been lying to you all this time?"  At that moment her eyes started to fill with tears.  David watched in wonder as Mindy switched to the role he had watched her perform so many times for other people, but he had never had the opportunity to witness the magic, or in her case tragic,  transformation first hand.  He couldn't believe she was going to use the "manipulation tears", as he called them, on him!  She must really be desperate if she was resorting to that poor me act.  He'd watched her practice the look in front of the mirror before going to court for a speeding ticket or on her father when she needed to borrow some money..though that was long before she started making it big in real estate.  He even found himself wondering if the tears that had first captured his heart that he saw her shed at his sister's wedding had been fabricated as well.  He was beginning to feel as if he didn't know her at all.  "Cut the bullshit Mindy!  You know I'm not gonna fall for that so let's just skip the little girl lost routine and finish this conversation."  David pounded his fist on the counter next to him in frustration.  Though the physical release of pain made him feel momentarily better, the pulsing of his hand only served to mock him for losing control.
