      There isn't any way on earth that I can write a proper Blog of the standard I've been reading but I'll try none the less.

      It's been raining all day. I wouldn't mind but it's that annoying rain that can't make up it's mind, where you wish it would either stop or really piss it down! I've run out of money and still need to do my weeks shop so I'm a bit pissed off by that too. Maybe I;ll go to my mums for dinner all week, ah no she's on holiday!! Can it get any worst?

      I did something on the spur of the moment on Saturday. My brother rang me at 12:30 and said he had a spare ticket for the Chilli Peppers, so I got in my car and drove down to London (114 miles) - I was in Kew Gardens station by 14:00 and in central London by 14:45! 40 quid to get in is a bit steep though. James Brown was supporting (man he's past it) with Chinks on Speed (the worst band in the world?). I got home at 01:45, shattered but glad I went.

      I was given a bike on Tuesday and I'm just sitting here wondering whether or not to go out for a bit of a ride around the park. The roads will be quite because everyone will be watching the England Switzerland match (1-0 to England at half time by the way).I haven't ridden a bike for ages and I don't want people to see me struggling to stay upright!

      Another whole day set aside for revision today...wasted! I went to Ikea instead and unbelievably I didn;t buy a single thing. Tomorrow is my most difficult exam "Financial Reports" and I am seriously doubtful that I will pass even if I spend all morning with my head burried in my textbook in a last minute attempt to learn a thing or two about double entry (not the sexual kind you understand!).  The man at the end of my street stared out at the window at me with an evil glare earlier on today. He doesn't like people parking outside his house and to be fair, if there was a space outside my house I would park there but there bloody well isn't so I'm left with little choice.

      Well that's one exam down with one to go. It didn't go too badly I think. Talking to others after you come out is always a mistake though as you can garuantee that you all have different answers! I just hope that we all did equally as badly so that if I've failed I can at least go back to work and tell them that we all failed (plus I don't want to be the only one resitting them in December - I do enjoy some company).

      I've just had two days off of work to revise for exams and guess what......that's right I haven't done any so I'm having to cram up now as my exams are on Monday and Wednesday. I don't think work will be very pleased if I fail them considering I've been given the extra leave in order NOT to fail them.

      I've been really busy lately. I'm taking part in a study for the Bristol Royal Infirmary it's called 'Affect of formal, structured and regular exercise on quality of life, cardiac function and exercise capacity of adolescents and adults with congenital heart disease.' Basically this men=and that last Monday I had to go to the hospital and do a treadmill test (along with some other stuff), I lasted nine minutes (it was a bloody fast treadmill) and was quite pleased with myself. Now I have to do a ten week exercise programme and go back in ten weeks time to take another test. I'm quite excited by it all to be honest!  They're planning the christmas meal at work (yeah....already) and so we all had to pick our prefered restaurant from the list provided. Here's the catch, it's 37 bloody pounds!! I'm so not going!! Am I being unreasonable?

      I haven't posted anything for a while so it's about time I had something to say - only trouble is, I don't! I got a webcam today so I've been playing with that for the last half hour and all I've learned from it is that I need to wash my hair!
