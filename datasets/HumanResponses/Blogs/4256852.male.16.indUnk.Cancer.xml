      I feel very odd today. I used to be the happiest kid in the world. I smiled constantly even when I wasn't thinking about anything. I was the one everyone was slightly annoyed with because you couldn't stop me from being happy. You know what happens to sensitive guys like that? Girls. I'm falling for her and lets just say she's not falling for me. She used the classic line that every guy never want's to hear ever never so if your a girl and you read this don't say this, "your such a good friend though, i wanna stay good friends, nothing more." I mean seriously, what the hell is that? Are you afraid of change? Or is it just that you're afraid that if you take a chance, that we will break up with you and never talk to you again? If thats it thats the most rediculous statement i've ever heard. If the guy really is a good friend and you give him a chance, i doubt he will stop talking to you. You know what the best part is though? The girls think that after they tell the guy that they should just stay friends, that the guy will just say ok, and continue on like nothing ever happened. They expect all the guys feelings to go away instantly. Imagine this, a girl is crushing over a guy, the guy finds out and tells her, i just wanna be friends (haha like that happens a lot), the girls feelings dont go away, most of the time they get depressed for a week or two and you can't have a coherent conversation with them without them crying. See how everything changes? If only things were simpler and girls could figure out what to do if they want dudes to talk to them. That's all for now, maybe more later peace

      So, My younger sister found my blog and started bugging me about Liza. "Alex like liza, alex likes liza!" I said yah, so? Mind your own business. But she kept nagging. Oh well, what ya gonna do? Oh ya, the guys slept over last night and that was good fun. Steve and sean played xbox hockey for 5 games straight and i think steve beat sean every time. Yah I talked to liza's sister about stuff and more stuff and found out some stuff. It was good fun. Glad to do stuff. Sean went home this morning. I drove steve home. I mowed my lawn and then went to lunch with steves family.  That was good stuff. I came home and cleaned the basement. Now steve is over and we're just chillen. I'll write more later. peace.

      Hey all. Today I woke up and found out that my mother took the tahoe to her work. So I took my car to her work, switched with her, and came home. I loaded up the mower into the back and mowed the Thursday lady as we like to call her. I went home, talked with steve, and then sent sean to go get him. Steve came over, we watched "Aliens" which is ok, story isn't good but the action is all right. Anywho, after dinner we went to Liza's and helped make cookies until we had to bring steve home. Now, more update on Liza. So, I called Liza today, cause, when I talk to Liza, everythings, different, special, I dunno how you describe it. Ya so I was talking to her on her cell phone and she says she has to go cause she wants to save her minutes. So I asked her if I could call her on her home phone and she said no. I didn't know how to answer that, so I said the first stupid thing that came to my mouth. Why? and of course she came up with some other excuse about how if we were talking the line would be busy in case someone else called. This upset me very much. I didn't know what to do. But like i said, we went to her house later and hung out. It was fun, i think she was stressed out though. I felt kinda bad cause she didn't seem to happy. It was annoying too cause all my friends were telling me to go for stuff, her parents were in the connected room over and could see everything so I wasn't going to do anything! But they kept annoying me, I didn't do anything though. I couldn't stomach it. I think Liza would get mad if I......... i dunno hugged her or something out of nowhere. I don't know. More later -thanks for reading-

      Yay, another great day, I think. I woke up and mowed a lawn, but I didn't get paid this week. After that I went and picked up Steve and brought him to my house. Sean came over and we had a good time. We all went to Mike's and plaed poker, which was very very fun. Later that day, Amy came over and left right before dinner. After dinner she came back and Liza came as well. I don't know what it is, I think I like Liza, as in you know, more then friends. Well we all drove Steve home and then came back to my house. Then it was me, liza, sean, and amy. Sean went home because he was late. So then it was me, liza, and amy. Amy left so it was just me and Liza. Perfect right? Not so much. We were in the basement and I turned on the T.V. She was talking on AOL and I asked her if she wanted to come watch T.V. with me.  She got up and started walking towards the couch and her cell phone rang, her little sister needed to be picked up from the movies, and she had to go home after that. So that was it for the night. Missed my chance,  what can I say. Peace guys, thanks for reading

      good morning all, I woke up this morning thinking that it was Thursday. If it was thursday I had a few lawns to do. Well turns out today is Wednesday, so I only have 1 lawn to do. I checked the weather and it's not  supposed to rain until noon. I'm going to call up the lady whose lawn I have to mow and schedule that up very soon. It 12 to 9 right now and I want to start at latest 9:30. I'm going to go call her. More later.

      Hello again, First, I ate dinner, which was exquisite, then I waited for a storm to pass, and then I headed to Steve's house. I ate dinner with Steve's family, which was also exquisite. We watched family guy while eating which was quite hilarious. Just so you all know, Family Guy is my favorite show ever and it should be yours too! So after dinner we called some people on my cell phone, whole bunch of that. Oh ya! I called Liza back and she was stil at "Bobo's" house. I know because when I called liza's phone, it wasn't liza. Some girl in a wasted/loose voice answers "hey babey" and you know the usual introductions. Then she said she was wasted or something like that so we stopped talking to her. Then liza got mad for no apparent reason. Ugh I'm so confused with that. Oh well. Hopefully tomorrow will bring clarity.

      So, today I woke up and went to starbucks, just as usual. Then I took my volvo to the volvo dealership to get the brakes done and the oil changed. I sat in the waiting room and watched the olympics for 2 and a half hours. It was boring but hey, what do you expect? We got our tails kicked by a 15 year old from Japan at table tennis (ping-pong). When I left we were winning 1-0 in soccer vs. australia. Oh yes, we creamed kazatzan or kaz-an or something like that in water-polo pretty good too. So, I went home and found my mother there. She was waiting to argue with me about how I should expand my lawn mowing service. I eventually went to my friend steve's house and hung their until 4. At 4 my gracious mother called me and said I had to come home for dinner. I got home around 4:25 and dinner will not be ready until 5. Mom's are unusual with their time estimates. So now I'm waiting for dinner. Oh yes, I nearly forgot, I called Liza and Amy to see if they wanted to come hang out with Steve and I. She said she was going to call her friend and then call me right back with all the information (i.e. when she was coming, with who, and how). Well she didn't call back for 2 hours so I called her. Turns out her and Amy went to the friend on the phones house. I asked them why they still didn't call. She mumbled something under breath and hung up. Don't you just love the drama of female friends. I find it hard to tread water in the estrogenical ocean, but I do my best. That's all for now. Thanks for reading
