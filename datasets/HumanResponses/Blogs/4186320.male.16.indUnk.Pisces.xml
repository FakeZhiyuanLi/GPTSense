      alright i had a preminition(sp?) the other day, why not write a book.. i write poems, raps, and songs.. why the fuck not write a book, right?.. anyway this is just the beginning, not even a whole chapter.. but its gonna be a collection of stories about Coudersport, love, hate, fun, shit like that.. kinda sounds corny now but the books gonna kick ur ass.. the intro is just my theories on life and death and love.. the death theory was brought about by Jake Acker and im adopting it.. because i think its true.. anyway, enjoy..   You see life and death everyday, in everything.  Music, movies, news, and even your own community.  But sometimes it's not enough, knowing that there is simply Life and Death.  Sometimes you wonder what's after Death, or even what's before Life. Before life there is emotion, passion, and "love".  In order to be passionate you must be emotional.  And in order to "love" or be "loved", there must be passion, passion between two significant others that believe they are in "love". There are two types of "love", physical and mental.  In order to physically "love" you must estabilish a mental "love" for one another, i.e. things that attract him to her and visa versa.  Once the bond of "love" is created a new life comes along with it.  Within this life there is emotion, passion, and love. I am not an expert on "love", just a young man lost in it.  These stories, theories, and events are all I have gathered in my 16 years of Life, enjoy.  -now after this it's like a million and one stories about ppl in love in coudersport.. parties and shit.. im gonna try and not use any names.. but it might get confusing.. i'll have to see what some ppl think after reading it.. ok now here's my theory on death adopted from Jake Acker-  I believe that when you "die" you are only dead in others eyes, to yourself you arent dead and you keep on living your life how you would have when you were alive.  The problem is that when i die i hope i'm not here, i hope i'm somewhere without drama, without problems, without the pollution of one's mind, i hope i become free.    -that's something how the ending will go.. but it'll end up adding more.. lemme know what you think, if i should continue righting it or not.. i know my theory on life and love probably isnt that good but hey im fuckin 16, and im gonna end up changing it by the time the books done.. and oh yeah if you didnt understand the Before Life concept, you'll never have children.. haha-

      iight these are three poems i wrote.. the last two poems where written when i was, let's just say in a different mind state, haha.. and the first one was written in 7th grade.. so enjoy the poetry and lemme know what you think about em..    i play a man of different roles in life... one being a poet paintin pictures with words... i bet my image didnt show it thoughts are transformed into scenary... using my pencil love looks like flowers... it’s like my mind were a stencil and the hate appears to be fire... but no names are present my mind gently strums a guitar... as my soul sits in heaven beauty and disgust of the world move me... so i write on it opinions of kings and servants become captured in my sonnet   Wakin up is a burden And i'm slowly burning Waitin for our love to blossom, As i sit and drink my mind starts to think how our love was surely forgotten, the time passes by as im getting high in attempt to drown a sorrow,  our love fades to black making it fact that surely there is no tomorrow.   i try to capture happiness, but it's too fast for me.   I’ve never seen an act of god, so i utter blasphemy.   They say that when he works, its in mysterious ways.   But sometimes I think GOD, makes some serious mistakes.

      iight man this is another collab with my boy Toddy from O.E.  ummmm thats all im gonna say hahaha so you know it's ill hahaha.. but for real its a semi deep piece, lemme know what you think..  (verse one : toddy) Broke, aint no lights on. Mama's drunk again, fight's on. Locked in my room, tryin to find the right song. Tryin to get on a mic and off these crutches. Rage in a haze from lightin green and smokin dutches. I'm ill, no question. Still they testin. Tryin to figure me out i leave em guessin. I'm the teacher, learn the lesson. They say angels watch me, but I don't feel the blessin. I'm lost, shit at this point I might burn in confession. Use raps to fight back. Throw white boy down and i'll get up and write back. No question if i might attack. I will. The mic is a weapon, I kill. You got beef, I fry that shit like a grill. Came up in a house known for violence. Ask me to speak, I was known for silence. Beat down when I spoke defiance. Got back up and left em stumped like rocket science. Fuck pain, me, this pen and this pad form an alliance. A triple threat, sick enough to cause riots. All I need is one beat. Only 2 choices, succeed or hit the street. Paper, all I need is a page. Every line releases my demons on stage. All I need is one mic. You been the king pin, I'm about to strike. I been broken and beaten. Now I'mma beat the odds, I need this, rappin's like breathin.  (Hook) 1 for where I've been. 2 for where I'm goin. 3 for the moment, its mine to win. (3x)  (verse two : toddy ) I aint sittin, here waitin for shit happen. 3 am got my pen and pad, still rappin. Stressed and ready to bust, like dudes packin. Gimme a beat and l'll get crackin. Sick of shit, now I'm reactin. Unleash my pain on a rhythym, you don't like my reaction? Use verses to break you down fraction by fraction. Time to take action. Talk is cheap, like a buck fifty. When I'm done they like: "what the fuck hit me?" Pops gave me up like he shit me. Mama's man still ready to hit me. Came out a broken home. My thoughts all twisted, like I gotta broken dome. Through the hurt my souls shines like chrome. I survived rain and thunder. More than the surface, but you can't see what lays under. Things I know you can only wonder. I'm a walkin cataclysm, haunted by empty promises and broken dreams. Wake up at night, vocals choked off by broken screams. Reality still crooked, never what it seems. One of many shattered lives. Eyes vacant, minds dull, like shattered knives. So I choose to speak for those without voice. So I choose to stand for those without choice I choose a mic over a roles royce. Rage inside burns, thats why I spit fire. From a hundred miles away you feel the heat thru the wire.  (Hook 3x)   (verse three : me ) an abused teen, abusing dreams  cuz i’ve seen so many abusing things use to have these dreams, altho they nightmares now use to be a fiend, altho the lights there now it once wasnt, wasnt dark use to have a normal life, fuckin cats and dogs but thats all lost, like raiders of the ark coulda been the boss, but i waited to damn long i was, scared to rap, scared to act scared that muthafuckas wouldnt feel my act so i stayed down, underground use to be rain and lightning, only thunder now all these cats wonder how, pro so ill ima tell you the real, pro got skill pro been up hills, and right back down em once hit rock bottom so i started takin downers outta towners, told me i was wack said my flow was crap, talkin pro cant rap so i stode away, threw the flow away came back one day, and cats was blown away now they all say, pro the illest pro the realest, its pro that make em feel this pro’s just fearless, and while we on the realness i got some serious shit to say, so hear this let it be known, pro stole the thrown cuz pro hold his own, pro good as gold muthafuckas...  (Hook 3x)

      iight this is a collab with my boy Toddy aka Dark Cyde from Otto Eldred, kid's handicapped but he's got iller rhymes then i do, and that's why i love him haha.. anyway, this is like all fast paced rhyming and punch lines.. i think it's ill, but let me know what you think, BITCHES.. oh yeah my last verse isnt finished yet hahahaha it's still hott tho..   Toddy- Propha-C, rollin wit P. Shakes. Rock sick on beats and breaks. Cats talk shit, but aint got what it takes. My boy..... yeah he from Coudy. We are hip-hop, Fuck u, I say it proudly. When I hit ya speakers it'll come out loudly. Bring it if u doubt us. Ask the dudes who lost battles about us. They all say shit. But us, lethal, like fire when we spray shit. We make moves, y'all mess with gay shit. Get real, don't play shit. Propha-C's back and im makin my claim. Beef with Shakes and feel the heat of my flame. Between us we'll break the game. Now its about fire, screw fame. Nothin new, all the same. On a mission now. Cross me and you'll be fishin now. See the vision now? Flow so ill I leave em wonderin how. Me and Shakes underground, they wana see us 6 feet. They'll back up, when they get sick of defeat. It's not really an issue. Shouldn't really take the time to diss you. Sick enough to strip bone from tissue. Watch me explode like an automic missle. Watch you back fire like a cheap pistol. If you think you stand a chance your thinkins wishful.  It's Blood in Blood out. No games, if u aint down butt out. Cowards best take shelter when we bust out.  Blood in Blood out. Beware when you hear the message. LOYALTY. The crews loose. Cant stand against 2 dudes with the screws loose. (2x)   Me- Our screws is loose,  better watch out when the crews is loose cuz we spit flames like cheap nintendo games and we hit fame then dudes pretend not to know our names know our ways, fuck nah, shakes covers the tracks bringin pure fire when propha-c’s all over the tracks all up on ya racks, ya prolly never get it back but whats to return when c and shakes is all over ya raps all over wit gats, its all over ya backs propha-c and p.shakes, you need to face the facts now about face, cuz your about to face the caged rage about to fuckin win this race the kids an ace 11 men all inside one face they run and hide from shakes but one day they’ll face the fact that shakes is all over the place he’s all over like mace all up in ya face shakes invadin ya space but ya shouldnta been steppin to shakes in the first place  Blood in Blood out. Beware when you hear the message. LOYALTY. The crews loose. Cant stand against 2 dudes with the screws loose. (2x)  Toddy- Yo, I'm fire, leavin you charred, smokin out the ass like diarrhea. Know the Prophet's mind is lethal, waitin to bite my next idea. Too strong for 1 spot, grab Shakes and I'm gone, SEE YA! Too many wanna be me. It's like my jaws oiled, talkin greasy. I make complex look easy. Lyrics leave ya mind wet, like sex real sleazy. Things fall in to place like I planned it. Soon as we roll up cats get underhanded. Diss the flow even though they cant understand it. Wanna talk about my life when they dont understand shit. Shakes got my back. Haters come heavy, they think it breaks my back. Gimme a beat and I'm a rocket with no breaks on a track. I'm maniac, no control. Gut you from the inside, leave a body with no soul. Do I gotta lay the smack down for you to know your roll? No nuts so you try to ride my poll. You can hear me on anything slick. When the streets talk all I hear is y'all on dick. Thoughts are slow, mine quick. You don't wanna fuck with a mind this sick. Can you kill this qiuck? Notta. Shine and I aint even rockin prada. Fakes and haters we see a lotta. I don't destroy cuz I can, I gotta. I aint even gotta spit 1 line and you know you lost. A buncha cowards, weak and soft. Here comes Shakes, I'll let him finish it off.  Me- deminishin all you know shakes’ll finish em off winnin the toss cuz all u dudes writtens is soft spittens was lost once shakes caught a beat and ran wit it like moss stand wit it you boss got a hand in it of course i throw u off course, wit my coarse flow “is that pro.found” of course you know
