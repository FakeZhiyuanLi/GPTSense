      I had the best weekend!!  Fiday night was girls night out with Ali aka Alison.  We went to see Ella Enchanted, It was my 3rd time seeing it and her 1st, and I still really loved it!  BTW Ali also happens to be Brad's Cousin...but whatever.  So it decided to rain a little right before we got to the movies......Thunder, lightning, Pouring down rain.....It was way cool!!!  FYI I live in a desert, and so anytime it rains or thunders or anything other than being incredibly dry I like to go play in it, I mean HELLO I am from Alaska here and I now live in a destert?!! Who would have thought?   Saturday and sunday I watched the olympic trials for women's gymnastics. I like to watch 'cause I am mystified as to how they DO any of that.  So I stayed up late doing laundry, cause I was a slacker earlier that week and Just didn't want to wake up this morning.  When you are tired mondays seem to last a lot longer than when you are well rested.  It's only 1:30 and I'm ready to go home  *shrug* But that's just 'cause I've gotten Lazy (thanks Noel) Untill next time -Becca

      Why is it that when you start working again after a break it is so much harder to put in 30-40 hours?  I remember working 120 hours and being about as tired as I am now bearly working 30.  He he   Maybe its the heat I mean it is in the 90's everyday here.  Anyway.................Y'all have a good day! -B

      OK so here is the deal....      I am trying to set up a massage-a-thon at my state capital so that all the people who work up there can have a chair massage.  Mostly 'cause you make better decisions when you are relaxed, and not completely stressed out.  AND because they will get addicted to massage and the place I work at is just a few blocks from the capital and they will remember me and how good I was and then I get lots of clients and make lots of money, and then take over the world.....muahahahahahahahah    Ok everything but that part about taking over the world. I daon't want to deal with all the stupid people I'ld have to if I did take over the world.  So everyone have a great day! -B

      Just a little advice......don't stay up untill 2am if you have to be up at 6am the next morning!  Mondays are bad enough anyway, a lack of sleep just makes them worse then they are already!! Add to that a 2 mile hike in very pretty but not so comfortable shoes, on hot pavement, with a time limit on how long it should take, in a all black uniform in Utah!   Ok I know I'm whining!!!  but that's cause I'm tired. I'll feel better after my nap!  So Brad's cousin came through town on her way to France.....But I'm not green eyed, nope not one bit........weeeeelllllll ok mabe a little! I got to see Lisa's baby (lisa is another cousin of Brad) she was very cute!  It seems many people I know are having cute kids....I think that genetics has gone wild and now there will be a super race of very beautiful people and all us old non genetic mutants will be their slaves!!!! OR my friends just have CUTE KIDS!!!! *laugh*  Well that's all for this installment of Becca's Life tune in next time as Becca conqueres the Utah State Legislature (details to come)

      Have you ever noticed that it is more work to help someone move than it is to move yourself?  Today is Day 2 of Sean and Alie's move.  and yes we are at last done, everything is out and the last touches of cleaning are being done as I take a break to type.       So also while I am typing I am talking to Tracy Cinkovich on my cell! YEAH!!!  So the countdown is on to my brother Jeremy's wedding in August, He is getting a little tired of wedding stuff, and He is just a few weeks from being done with paramedic school.......He's a busy man!!!  I'm just trying to be here for everyone in my life, and get all my stuff done, I'm just a little stressed with everything thats going on.  I am really greatful for all the support that I've been getting from friends, and family.  Keep wishing me luck on this job! -B

       I never thought I could get so busy in such a short amount of time.&nbsp; It's Monday again and I just got back from a whilewind adventure to Montana.&nbsp; boating, swimming, hiking, camping and all those other ings......&nbsp; I got way tan (yeah skin cancer) and had a blast, got to see Bruce Allen a friend from Alaska while I was there......also way cool.&nbsp; but mostly I got out of Utah, and now I really don't want to be here    &nbsp;  I don't know how many people who read this have been to Utah, but one thing everyone who has been here can agree on is that it's like stepping off the face of the known world into a new universe!&nbsp;&nbsp; It's hard to explain to those of you who haven't had the experiance......but it's a mix of extreams, and prejudices, with a load of the old "men are better" line........the weirdest part about it is that you would think its the religiouse zelots who were like that....and that's not really the case.&nbsp; I mean don't get me wrong there are some crazy people&nbsp; around here, and some of them are LDS (the predominant religion) but most of the people who are the worst are the ones who were religious and now are not or the ones who hate the predominant religion and anyone who happens to be it, no matter how nice they happen to be (like me)    &nbsp;  Ok I need to know something.......... Have I ever offended anyone by pushing my belifes onto them?&nbsp; or am I closed minded, or in anyway hard to talk to about stuff?&nbsp; 'cause lately I've been getting that from people that I consider very closed minded................I WANT TO MOVE TO WASHINGTON!!!!!!    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  ok so FYI I'll be in seattle the weekend after the 18th of august, Jeremy (my brother) is getting married and I'm going to the gig harbor ren fair to play.......so if you want to see me while I'm there give me a call and I give you times and places I'll be, Well off to work again!    &nbsp;  -Becca

      I was just wondering....  WHO GETS MARRIED ON A WEDNESDAY!  and then expects others to drop everything to not only go to the wedding but then to a reception wed. night?!  Does this seem fair to the friends and family of the two people getting married?   To  answer my question...my brother gets married on a wednesday.....and so both Brad and I have to take most of the day if not all of that day off so we can go.........kinda lame!!!! oh well at least he is getting married, it could be worse he could end up one of those old bachalor brothers thats lives alone forver and never has kids or a girlfriend or anything.  Although if he did stay single he would have more money to lend me, and this would deffinatly be a good thing..... dang! but his bride to be is way cool! and he's happy so I guess wednesday it is, but really I want feed back on this.   What do all you people out there think about wednesday weddings?  -B

      Wow I can't belive it's been so long since I wrote something!!!  Well I am in the middle of the move to ogden, and I am working crazy hours at my new job, and generally trying to not die of the heat here in Utah.  Ok so this is the wetest, coolest summer in like 10 years for Utah, but I am from ALASKA so a little leeway is in order.  Can you belive in two weeks Jeremy (my brother) will be a married man?  I know weird huh?  He's just a little stressed LOL so it's Becca to the rescue.  I'm helping him send out announcments, and making her veil.  Yes I know I am the nicest sister in the whole wide world! AND HUMBLE TOO!   Anyway.... I'm really proud of myself right now, Not only did I get next years club massage budget done a week early, but I also found a way to run a two person massage clinic full time on a $81 a month budget.......everyone should be very impressed! My boss sure is!!!!  So I've started working out at least three times a week, and for all those who know me this is very strange.....but I'm finding in my old age *snort* that I really am enjoying it.  I sleep better and I'm slowly loosing the extra pounds....all good!  The hope is that I'll look like I did when I got married by next summer, maybe better.   ok so have you ever just known what you were supposed to do with your life?  I mean honestly just saw something and known without a doubt that you were supposed to do that for the rest of your life, and that it would make you very happy and fulfilled?  I'm going to guess that this is rather rare........but lately I've been meeting more and more people who are in jobs-careers like that.....that they felt called to and even though they are sometimes crazy (what job isn't at times) these people are SO HAPPY!  I have never met so  many fulfilled people in my life..... It's making me wonder about what I have chosen, is it what I've been "called" to or just another job?   ok well that's my thought for now. -B
