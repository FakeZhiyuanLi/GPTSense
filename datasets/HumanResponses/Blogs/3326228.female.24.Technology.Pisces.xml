        We sincerely apologize for Mara. She’s just a bit dramatic in her storytelling. We love her dearly, but she tends to be a little… overzealous. I think that it might be time to introduce ourselves and tell a little bit about why we came to be here; and why we’re sharing our stories.    &nbsp;We must conceal some detail of ourselves and our work in order to protect our own lives and keep our operations safe for the future. The three of us make up the world’s last and best defense against the evils of the world. Revenant vampyres occur all the time. We try to be careful in our breeding and our seeding of humans; however, its not always possible to know beforehand how these things will turn out. Occasionally, we must strike down one of our own kind in order to preserve the natural order of things, and our way of life.     My name is Ireth. I was born a long time ago, under another name, during a time when Egypt was a fairly young land. I was human then, and a priestess, of a goddess who's name has long since been forgotten. She was a Mother, a nurturing presence of the Earth. I have lost much of my old religion, but I do believe in Her still, and I hope she hasn't forgotten me. To go through my entire past would take much more time than the humans who will read this have to live. I will tell you that I have punished myself for my existence far more than anyone else on this earth ever could have. But I no longer believe that I am evil by my very nature. I have learned much over these many years of myself, and the world in which we live.     I have been a priestess, a beggar, a Lady, a singer, a festival performer; I was even a queen, once. Now, I am proud to tell you that I am part of something much larger than myself. We call ourselves Dante's Demons after the fictional character who traveled through Hell. We named ourselves this because the three of us have all journeyed through our own personal hells and come out the other side, not only stronger, but extraordinarily so. I'm very proud to say that where I once spent centuries wandering through time aimlessly, I now have a purpose. My purpose is to protect those weaker than myself and uphold the name of good wherever I can.     Some of you may be wondering... You must have figured out by now that I am a vampyre. I was born more years ago than I can remember. So why, when history has painted my entire species as evil, would I "uphold the name of good"? Ah, because Mara was correct, of course. Not everything is as the stories speak of them. Just as not all humans are good, not all of my kind are evil. Actually, good and evil are relative ideals. Some of my kind even believe that good and evil are myths thought up by the human mind. I, however, believe very much in good. Perhaps that's just because I want to believe. I want to believe I'm good. And I want to believe that when this world is done with me, then I may go home to my Goddess and be content until time and the world end.     I did not mean to spend such time here, but it is cathartic to speak to you all after so much time has passed. I have much to bestow upon the world; but even I cannot do that all at once. Mara, Symone and I have work to do this evening. Perhaps one of us will even tell you about it when we return. Farewell until next time and remember:        Damnant quod non intellegunt.          "They condemn what they do not understand."

         Being the youngest of the three of us, it seems the daunting task of beginning what I feel is a ridiculous idea falls to me. Welcome to the mission journal of the little group we like to call Dante's Demons. We have an official government issued classification, of course, but I can't share it with you. Top secret, you understand. This was Symone's idea but, of course, she is too busy to come up with a good way to begin this. So, it falls to me to come up with something spectacular. Being the youngest, and the only human, sucks ass.  You see, the three of us: Symone, Ireth and I, are creating this in order to inform the people, of this country and of the world, about their danger. Not the danger of terrorism, or of weapons of mass destruction. Not the danger of murderers, rapists, or politicians. There is another danger out there for the mere mortal. They're called the Lost Ones, renegades, revenants… killers. There are secrets within secrets in the world; and we’re going to introduce you to a few of them. Sit back and let me explain to you how the world really is.  There’s mythology behind this, but they’re not my beliefs, so I’m not going to waste my time with them. I’ll just give you a glimpse of how it really is. The truth is, we are not alone. We have never been alone. And all the horrors of your nightmares cannot compare to the reality of the situation. You see, vampires are real. Werewolves? Well, they’re not just wolves. Shape shifters. The stuff of midnight sweats, where you pull the covers up to your chin and peer desperately into the darkness wondering what’s out there, and if it will come to claim you. Sometimes, it does.  Now, not everything is as Bram Stoker claimed it was. The mind explains where it doesn’t have an answer. And so, some things are very different. You see, the vamps have always been predators. They have a lust for blood that nothing else on earth can come close to. it’s a deficiency in their cells that does it, or so I’ve been told. Symone is the scientist, and she’s told me so. I can’t tell you exactly how it works, because I don’t know. What I do know, is that they can control it. A vampire can live a very long time drinking the blood of warm-blooded animals. It seems they don’t like to drink cold blood; they can’t stand sinking their teeth into a lizard or such. But, throughout the centuries, we’ve become sort of a delicacy to them. They love us the way I love a sirloin steak. I can go without the steak if I want to, choose something else. Most of the vamps existing in the world today go without their sirloins, or at least find a willing “donor” that won’t give them away. The vamps are ruled by their own congress, which exists solely to interact with the governments of the world and keep their secrets hidden. This congress is the vampire law. Unfortunately for the vamps, though, they don’t get due process. If they break their laws, they just get dead.  Other things from the stories that aren’t true about vamps? They can go out in daylight. Sunshine weakens them a bit, they can’t do a lot of their tricks. The strangeness in their blood makes them just allergic enough to sunlight to prevent them from causing too much mischief. That, and eating in the daylight is a good way for a vamp to sign his own death warrant. They’re also not afraid of crosses, although most of them have only contempt for the religion of humans. However, a lot of them are allergic to silver. Oh, and vamps don’t turn into bats or anything else.  Which brings us to the next order of business: shape shifters. The shifters are the traditional enemies of the revenant vampires. Depending on who you ask the story varies from them working for the vampires, in effect being their hired guns, to them being the natural enemies of all vamps, having been put here to control their population and protect humankind. The shifters come in many varieties. There are wolves, of course. There are also: large cats, wyverns, hyenas and bears. These five tribes have their own ruling body, which has existed nearly as long as the vampire congress, and also interacts with the humans in power.  Worried yet? Because this is real, chicks and dudes. Real life nightmares come to life. Kind of makes your hair stand on end, doesn’t it? Well, for those of you who aren’t yet ready to either run screaming or shrug your shoulders and call our story a fake; good for you. Tune in next time, kiddies, for another dose of reality.

       It is hard to get close to people in my line of work. I am always away from home, travelling around the world. That is not considering that fact that most men are intimidated by a strong woman. Even others of les griffés would be wary of me. They  are  wary of me. Not only do I work closely with one who is considered our natural born enemy; but I am also intelligent, ambitious, and I have trained my body until I can pick up a small car with little effort. Even ifles griffés are naturally stronger, most of the females do not condition their bodies to that extent. None of this is exactly good weather in which to form a loving relationship.  It very nearly makes me miss my ex-fiancé. Almost. Until I remember that he is a no-good, inconsiderate saboteur. And if I ever see him again, I will not kiss him-- I will kill him. You remember when I said that my parents were murdered? I lost not only just my parents on that day. I lost my love, my companion, my entire family, and very nearly my life. The hunters that trapped and murdered my parents made a deal and bought off my ownfianc é in order to complete their evil deed. Little did I know that he had discovered he would inherit the entire estate of my parents in the south of France if we all died. Too bad for him that I didn't.  I remember that day like it was yesterday. Some nights I awaken in sweat and tears from a my nightmares.  Nightmares of   the giant orange harvest moon, hung like some god's eye against the velvet darkness of the sky. The landscape of the country outside Paris fell away beneath her as she soared high in her flight. I had felt secure there, happy and free with my parents and   fiancé   around my. The warm air caressed my irridescent wings as we flew on a backdrop of stars.       The four of uswould have been a beautiful sight, had human eyes been able to behold us. Instead, our scaly hides refracted the light, bending it around our bodies until we could not be seen,except by body heat alone. I turned her head, sensing the warm glow of Jacques falter from my right side. My eyes in that form are a shade of silver, and were able to "see" my family thermally. Jacques had begun to sink beneath the cloud cover, toward a wooded hillside below. *Jacques?* I sent a concerned thought his way. No answer.          My parents, sensing his distress, began their descent immediately behind him; determined to slow his now erratic descent toward the trees. Jacques landed within the woods, shrouded by a heavy fog so that he disappeared from sight. My parents landed moments behind, while I was still aloft behind them.          There was a flash and a retort, and then a roar of pain from below. Now alarmed, I descended faster. *No!* Came my mother's thought-voice. *Run! There are hunters here! Go home! We will follow!*          My mother's voice was calm, with just a hint of tremble. I brushed the tremble off as shock. How dare hunters try to capture my family! We were strong wyverns, keeping the family secret and active in Paris' political life. My father was wealthy, and we lived in an estate to the south of the city. My family had spent generations trying to aid the humans of France. It was madness! But I had faith in my parents' abilities. In my 19 years, I had never seen anything Jean and Collette could not overcome. So, I obeyed my mother's command and flew the two hours back toward the city. I landed in the still-wooded outskirts, and sat hunched and silent in the dark. I waited, breathless with worry for my family, and invisible to the surrounding night for another hour. No one came.           After that time, with only a few hours left until dawn, I drew my courage around me like a gauzy veil and returned to the hillside. My eyes found no hint of warmth for miles, so I landed, wondering if the hunters had succeeded in capturing my family after all. I touched down in a clearing soaked with blood. My father's body lay slightly closer to the near side of the clearing, his razor-sharp claws reaching toward me: as if the attack had come from this way, and he'd been protecting the wife he'd adored. They were both skinless and decapitated at the base of the neck. The heads and skins had been taken as trophies. Large railroad type spikes through each limb had kept them from taking off toward the sky again.          There was a whole blown in my mother's right side, nearly an entire lung was missing. I remember that I trembled, remembering my mother's last calm command; my limbs shook with the pain my mother must have kept out of her thought-voice. Jacques was nowhere to be found. I threw back my long neck and keened, a high-pitched song for the dead. I sat there as the sun rose, took his peek at the carnage of the clearing, and then hid his face behind the hills farthest to the west. I had no worries for the hunters, they had their trophies; they would not be back.          Finally, after over a day of mindless grief, I used my kind's natural pyrokinetic ability to cremate the rest of the remains- bones and all- to a large pile of ash. I could not take them back with me and I could not leave them there for humans to find. Without our skins, we can be seen as easily as anything else. When I returned home, Jacques was waiting for me. He was hurt, and claimed that he had attempted to assist my parents, and realizing he could not, had run. He said he'd searched for me, but given up with the dawn, thinking me dead. Then he lunged at me with a sword he'd had hidden behind the door. It pierced me low on my left side, and I turned and ran. I'm not sure how I managed to get away from him. Shock and adrenaline, I suppose it would have to have been. I managed to shove him hard enough that he fell, and hit his head on a marble plinth in the entryway. I took the opportunity to run; far and fast. I stayed in Paris only long enough to have my would tended to. Then, I emptied one of my bank accounts and boarded a plane for America, hoping I would find someone there to help me with my revenge.     Its been a long time since then, going on five years. Revenge isn't my only reason to stay living anymore. I have good friends and a job that I love. But I still miss having a man around; a warm body next to me at night, and strong arms around me during the day. I don't feel like I can trust a man again, especially not one of my own kind. If he could sell out his own people, what else would he have done? Men to me seem to be more evil sometimes than revanant vampires. I wonder if there's even one out there for me. True love doesn't seem to be the happy ending that it used to be.

        Reading over Symone's post, I have to say that she's way too sentimental about things. I understand why she feels sorry for the big bad wolf from the other night. He was one of her people, and they consider each other very precious because there have always been so few of them.  I could never feel sorry for him. Symone has also mentioned my "gift". Its hard to describe it really. A feeling from out of nowhere that you have no reason to feel. I always thought while I was growing up that I was just too sensitive. My parents believed I had an over-active imagination. I would cry for no reason, or feel pain which had no medical explanation. It wasn't until I was older that a government scientist told me I was an empath. That was after I'd volunteered to become one of their "problem solvers" and they decided to "enhance" all of my inborn abilities and talents. But I'm going off the subject here.  What I'm meaning is that no one who could have felt even an echo of that girl's pain and fear would be sympathetic at all to that young man's death. Yes, he was apologetic at the end- even despairing of what he'd done. But apologies and despair will never give her back her life. Her emotions cling to me still, like a soft gray fog drifting in the back of my brain. They'll dissipate with time, but the memories of it never will.  Symone says I try not to feel because I feel too much. Maybe she's right. But no matter how strong I believe I am, I am not strong enough to ignore the panic, fear, and despair of the world around me. I don't really understand how anyone could not feel these things. They seem plain enough to me.  I won't tell you that its all bad. And I don't tell you this for your pity. There are plenty of other people who deserve that more than me. I get to use this strange talent of mine to help save and avenge hundreds of lives a year. Good times get amplified as much as bad. They just don't seem to last as long.  Sometimes, when the job's been particularly tough, the three of us will rent a cabin in the middle of nowhere where all of us can truly be ourselves. We stock up on plenty of food and booze and play pool, or sit in the hot tub, or hike for a weekend. When the good times get going and the laughter is bright, that's when I feel like I'm lucky. Lucky to be where I am and lucky to have great friends.  Bah! Now who's being sentimental? What's the moral of my story? Another bad guy dead. Another life avenged. Another win for the good girls.  Well, maybe "good" isn't exactly the right word...

        It is unfortunate that the work Ireth was referring to in her last note, was the capture and the execution of a young werewolf who had lost control of his  bête de la lune  and had murdered his girlfriend. It is a horrid accident that happens sometimes. It happens rarely, if the mentor of the youth does his job well. For we, the shape changers, our most horrible crime is to kill a human. We believe our purpose here is to protect the weak bodies of humanity. For the millennia we've been here, that has been our only work and our major principle. We call ourselves  les griffés,  the Clawed  Ones.
