      She called me yesteday. We were chatting on the messenger and then she like didn't read something I wrote, and i was like glad because after all i was afraid to know that she read that. So like her brother and some firends had turned off the computer so she went offline, like three minutes later she comes back online and she like doesnt understand me cuase i was still waiting for an answer. So she was like what did you ask, of course i had already told her that i asked her something but i told her i wouldnt ask her again so like in less than a minute she calls and she is all curious about what i asked. But i endup not telling her and she had to hang up cuase she is not supposed to use the phone. And i really was scared to ask her that, but i guess ill have to tell her sometime cuase i don't think she'll stop asking me.

      I don't know what's going on. Im still wating for things to happen, i feel like in trance as if i could do nothing about anything, i hate it. Besides i don't want to mess things up, i prefer they mess up by themselves or by someone else. Oh oh.. and today they complimented my service at Arandas =).

      What at night was last night! It was cool thou not to remember very well what I did. Apparently I still cry for Candice, well actually Adolfo made me cry it wasn't that I suddenly started thinking about her they made me think about her, but it feels like shit to think about someone you love and hear people talking shit about that person. And then to make things worst other people keep talking shit when I get sober. I don't want to keep thinking about her, but it's just how I feel, and I hate that other people try to make me think different about her when I totally think the opposite. It's just fucked up the way some people are, trying to manipulate other people's feeling just to feel better about themselves or to see other people feel bad, to much hypocrisy mostly on girls...   Well not only bad moments I had in Medina Lake last night, I also found out some funny things that weren't very funny to me but they made me laugh seeing it from another perspective.  1. I was swimming all the way to the middle of the lake, well I was in a floater and this girl is all scared and she goes there all the way to get me and "save" me but like I saw her all tired and I gave her the floater and I went back all the way swimming by myself, haha.  2. I fucked up my sister's cell phone, I got in the lake with it. Hopefully it turns on again.  3. When we were leaving they were all looking for my shirt, and I told them it was gray, and actually it was just a white underwear t shirt. So I end up leaving without a shirt.  4. We got lost in our way back to the city, I don't remember shit.  5. They took me home, but I told them I didn't want to get home yet, I guess I kind of knew how I was.  6.I woke up in Adolfo's truck, later I found out I told them I didn't want to get off the truck, after finding out I was all alone in the truck I went insides Adolfo's house, there were like three different persons in the floor plus like other four in the bed, the ones I knew was Adolfo, Rodolfo, Janet and Lucha, the rest I didn't even knew.  I don't really remember everything that happened at the lake, I kind of have vague memories haha but it was ok I guess.

      “Goodbye,” he said to the flower. But she made no answer. “Goodbye,” he said again. The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold. “I have been silly,” she said to him at last, “I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy…” He was surprised by this absence of reproached. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness. “Of course I love you the flower said to him. “It is my fault that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance. But you- you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy… Let the glass globe be. I don’t want it any more.” “But the wind -” “My cold is not so bad as all that… The cool night air will do me good. I am a flower.” “But the animals-” “Well I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems to me that they are very beautiful. And if not the butterflies- and the caterpillars- who will call upon me? You will be far away…As for the large animals- I am not at all afraid of them. I have my claws.” And, naively, she showed her four thorns. Then she added: “Don’t linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!” For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower. -The Little Prince Antoine de Saint Exupery

      I met this girl, well i didn't actually met her but i talked to her, well i didn't talk but write from a friend's messenger to her and she was so much like Candice. She was like Candice but like from Guadalajara and that's all. She was even like her in the way they both always smile. They both think strawberryshortcake is an angel and i think both of them are sweet little girls. This two girls are crazy about little stuff, like for example this "Chibiusa" (that's her screen name) loves this Japanese series so much i don't know why but she does. And well Candice likes more strawberry shortcake than Chibiusa but she also has other little things she does that i love she does, like collecting things or having certain type of items, i don't know i think it's cool. They are different in that Chibiusa likes to read and i don't think Candice does but i know Candice likes to write and i know she does it great, while i don't think Chibiusa does. Also they would like to be artist, Candice say she would be an actress and Chiobusa sings so that's cool. I think it's cool to know there's someone out there very alike to Candice.

      Yesterday was a wierd day. i didn't like it at all. I went to sixflags but everything came out wrong ansd i also hated it cause i got all jealous from tamarindo and Candice. And Lety one of the girls that went with us got all mad and we lost her so she was by herself for like i don't know, 4 hours or more. Then like later everything got worst when Candice's mom was looking for her, and like she wasn't not supposed to be with us, something i didn't knew but i understood really fast beacuse i know how her mom is. Well she was thinking of running away and like i offered her my house but we didn't knew what was going on since we were still in six flags and we weren't answering any phone calls but Candice's sister wich was in a friend's house also without permission. So like at 10:10 we called a cab since we didn't find a ride home. We stop in a ATM becuase we didnt hace but $20 and it wasn't wnough money to get to my house and get the van so i could pickup Bianca, Candice's sister, and drop off Susan and tamarindo later. Well we dropped off Susan and later we picked up Bianca and convinced her to go to her house  but we dropped her like to houseas down of hers, appearantely they saw the van so i think that got me a little in trouble later.After that tamarindo, Candice and I were going to my house, but i saw my mom in the living room and it was weird cause well she was like waiting for me, so i told them "let's go to mayras house" which is really close to my house so there we went and i called my dad just to tell him we found a ride home and that i was at mayras house and he sounded all mad and he told me that the police was looking for Candice and stuff. So we all got in some sort of trouble but peptio later picked up Candice at mayras house so when the police called my house i gave them info about pepito and they later went to his house. Candice later called me but she didn't tell me where she was but i guessed she was at Lety's cause i heard her voice. I don' what happend in between but later Susan parent came to my house and told me that they didn't want me to have anything to do with their daughter so i was all sad, but still i will se her at school =P. The last call i received that day was from Susan to tell me that Candice was already at her house, then i fall asleep.

      We are just friends so we say.....  Such a friendly way you captivate my every thought when you look my way, such a friendly way, when your eyes go a certain way, such a friendly whisper in my ear, to tell me something, to make me smile, such a friendly way, I make you laugh, you say my name in a way that no one else can do, such a friendly way, we walk in class, a little world people call our own, when we are together such a friendly gaze, we got lost in went through a maze or the school hall we find each other.   But we are just friends right?....  so we say...                                 by C.V.

      I don't practice santeria  I ain't got no crystal ball.  I had a million dollars but I'd,  I'd spend it all.  If I could find that heina and that  pepito  that she's found,  well I'd pop a cap in  pepito  and I'd slap her down.   What I really wanna know,  my baby, what I really want to say I can't define.  Well it's love,  that I need, oh ,  but my soul will have to,  wait till I get back and find heina of my own.  Daddy's gonna love one and all.   I feel the break,  feel the break,  feel the break and I got to live it up,  oh, yea huh, well I swear that I.  What I really wanna know, baby,  what I really want to say I can't define.  that love make it go,  my soul will have to...   What I really wanna say,  my baby,  What I really wanna say is I've got mine.  and I'll make it, Yes, I'm comin' up.   Tell  pepito  that if he knows what is good for him he best go run and hide.  Daddy's got a new .45.  and I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down  pepe's  throat.  Believe me when I say that I got somethin for his punk ass.  What I really wanna know, my baby,  what I really wanna say is there's just one,  way back,  and I'll make it, yea,  but my soul will have to wait.  yea, yea, yea

      This has been a very boring saturday, very different from my other boring saturdays where i have to wake up early and work. This time i just woked up early and went and took a 3 and something hours test. At least i hope i did fine, fine beacuse i didn't studied for more than two hours. And it was kind of hard since it was in my second language, english. The math sections were fine it was just in the verbal sections where i don't  know how i did.   Hopefully i don't have to take it again, they are making the next SAT harder. I'll wait and see what happens, and fuck i still have to pass the english taks test =(...

      Stay like that for a moment, don't look my way That i can't stand if you nail your glance That freezes my body, it happened before That i can't talk  Maybe you think i'm crazy And it's kind of true, i have to accept But if i don't explain what i feel inside, You won't understand when you see me cry  I never felt so lonely Like when yesterday suddenly i understood when i stopped crying Life told me yelling That i never had you and i never lost you, and it explained to me  That love is something That suddenly happens in a natural way, full of fire If you force it it withers Without having a begging it comes to an end  Now maybe you can understand  That if  you touch me, my skin burns Now maybe you can understand And don't look my way if you don't want to see  That i cry for you That i cry without you And i cry    it reminds me of Candice =(

      Men Lety is leaving, or at least is what she says. I think she should leave now that she told everyone she was and after all the things she received because she was supposed to leave like a week ago. But no, she started working at a park and now she is talking about her second paycheck which is like two weeks from now. I mean it's fine if she stays, she is the one with the "ballroom" her house is the place where we all hang out the most; but if she already said she'll leave i think she should. Besides i think she talks too much and that she badly influnces certain people with her hypocritical wisdom that i hate.   I hope she moves to Laredo as soon as possible, i think it's better for everyone, even for her and for the people she badly influences.

      Pulp Fiction is like the best movie ever, i cant stop adimiring this movie.&nbsp;It has everything a good movie needs. I was watching it today and i love to hear the dialogues again, that one about the royale with cheese is good, also Ezekiel 20 somethin, somethin.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark humor in it makes you feel bad about laughing, but it just makes you love this movie even more, it is even sometimes cartoonish and cynical in&nbsp;a very good way. Uma looks pretty in this movie, prettier than in any other movie ive seen her, maybe because of the black hair. The soundtrack is also good, Quentin Tarantino carefully and gracefully chose the adequate song at the right moment. Men what a couple Tarantino and Copolla make, both great writers and directors.

      I got to use the van again, i got to drive it to work and use it for some other driver duties,&nbsp; as if they paid me for it. I guess my mother knows that by letting me drive that van is like a price for me. Im hoping of getting a better job and buy a new car, im interested in something like a focus or a beatle. I really prefer the VW but first i shold be thinking abotu hte job. Im going tomorrow to ask for it,&nbsp; pray so i can get it...for reals pray. I want that car so much. I cant wait to put my hands on my own car. Im going to pray tonight, really bad, really bad to get that job, to get that car.

      She got mad at me again, i hate the way she acts and sometimes, althou i dont watn to say it, the way she is. She wants me to be the way she thinks i should be, she thinks that what she thinks or many people think is right. She doesnt consider my opinion, maybe im in her house and i should follow some of their rules but that doesnt necessarily means i will follow them.&nbsp;I guess ill have to live with the consequences.

      Yesterday it was a weird but normal day. I woke up like i regularly do, at about 12; but i felt differnet, i felt like doing something i dont regularly do. As i woke up acting like i didn't want to but at the same time tired of being in bed i went to the kitchen and made my self some scrambled egg, i didnt want scrabled eggs but i screwd up i didnt mixed the eggs and i just did it the way you do for scrambled eggs. Well i ate my scrambled eggs with orange juice and some milk as I was watching the news. After that I went to the pool for like 30 min i usually go longer and with my sisiter&nbsp;but this time i was alone and this man in the pool wouldn let me act as i usuallly do, diving and swiming all the way in the pool.&nbsp; I watched episode 9 and 10 of the Sopranos, men the first season is so cool, i also watched Everybody loves Raymond something i've been doing for the last two days for the only reason that im so bored now that Rodolfo and Adolfo left. At night i ws preparing to go to Gorettis house after talking to her for so much time about "what are&nbsp;we&nbsp;doing tonight?" and after telling her that i&nbsp;had the keys for the car. Well i decided to leave the house trough the window so i didnt make to much noise&nbsp;with the door, apparently&nbsp;my mom found out about 10 minutes after i left. She called Adolfo and Goretti, she didnt get an answer&nbsp;about my location,&nbsp;I, by&nbsp;Conejo, Goretti's brother, found out that she called. At first i tought it&nbsp;was a joke or somethin but then i talked to him and he convinced me, he told me&nbsp;he had told her that i wasnt there. After finding that out i decided to call Adolfo to see if she had called him as well and she did, Adolfo heard somehtin he shouldnt have heard, about how he suppospely makes me act&nbsp;"different". Since i found out i was cought i decided to have fun for a while, i stayed at&nbsp;Goretti's until like 1:30, 30 minutes&nbsp;earlier of the time i had foreseen to return home. I knocked on the door twice i was already thinking of taking the car and staying there to sleep, but she did open the tirth time i knocked, she just gave me a scary sarcastic laugh and asked me for the keys, i gave them to her and i went to me before sleeping routine.

      Its so boirng i dont know what i am going to do. I dont even have anything to move myself on, my mother doesnt watn to lend me the car, i guess ill have to steal it; maybe at night when everybody is asleep. Now i have to take the keys, ill act like im goign to fix the&nbsp; mirror on the van and ill leave the keys on the keyholder, where they are supposed to be on first place. I wanted to go to Goretti's house, im so bored in here i want to go out and spend money or do something!  &nbsp;I think i got over Candice already, im not sure ill see what happens when i see her. It just that i dont think about her as i used to do, i guess i tried to see what she did and what she does and apparently i dont feel like im losing something anymore, last time i was in the situation to cry for her i didnt, i would say that's progress. Still, i wish i don't get to the point where i dont care for her at all, and its difficult cuase thats how im getting over her, but still i want her to be my best friend, the truth is that right now i dont know if thats going to be possible. Lately i been thinking about this other girls maybe thats why i forget about Candice, one of the girls is really hot but i only think about her on weekend and this other girl i like the way she is, so simple and nice and full of intention to have a good time.   Yesterday Adolfo came! It was cool to see him i missed him a lot, we kept talking for about 3 hours, i mean thats my guess cuase i didnt really have sense of the time. So we talked and we smoked and we recognized several things about life and what comes with it, he had to leave like an our before he left and i wanted to stop talking cuase i was afraid it was to late to call this girl i wanted to talk to. At the end Adolfo left and i didnt call her cause it was too late, but i really wanted to talk to her, the truth is i wasn't sure what i was going to say but i felt like talking and joking with her.  Yesterday, since i had nothing important to do i&nbsp;checked out from the library&nbsp;like six books and a movie, so long, i've only read one chapter of a book called "El Coronel No Tiene Quien le Escriba" by Gabriel Garica Marquez, one of my favorite authors.&nbsp; I hope i finish reading all the books i checked out, none of htem are too long.

      We are having a bbq this friday,its cool, they are not inviting many people. I want Candice to come but i dont want to invite her cause i know pepito would come and i really dont like to see them together. Besides its better if i dont lell Candice that way she wont get in trouble if she tries to come. I hope they dont tell her, since Goretti was the one in charge of inviting all the girls, and i was in charge of calling all the guys {they want me to invite pepito but, hell no!}

      Candice sent me a really cool e card; it was about friendship. I think she knows i m stupid and she knows that i really get content with any demonstration of appreciation from her. I really like being her best friend.

      I talk to Candice again, the truth is that i never wanted to stop talking to her, i love her so much as a friend, and as a person, it just that i get mad because i really get jealous when she is with other guys. But i guess its cool to be her best friend, now i need to learn how to live with that idea, to never stop thinking about her {like i've been doing} but also no thinking about her as somehting else besides my best friend, and let things happen as they should and as destiny wants. She sent me a really nice e card, i told her she was the penguin and i was the rabbit, i hope we can be friends for a long long time. I love her so much. I miss having class with her.

      I told Canidce i didn't want to see her or hear from her right now; and now i feel bad. She called yesterday saying who i'm i talking too and she said "You wish you never met me right?" and i was like "no" but i was all sad, i felt like crying again, but the truth is that i do feel sad and the truth is that it is her fault. I don't know why she is surprised i wrote her that email. I really don't like to make her feel bad but is only me who thinks about her all day long, sometime i even get lost nowhere just thinking about her, and she doesn't understand, i hate to know that she is with him. And like today, i didn't go to the lake just because i don't want to see them together, i'll just start crying. And bofo is like "Are you going to stop going all places just cause they are going to be there?" And maybe he is right i shouldn't stop going places because of them, but i can't right now i know i'll make the night a bad one anyways. Maybe im selfish and i don't let her be happy, but the truth that's how i feel right now, i don't want her to be happy with him.

      Después de algún tiempo aprenderás la diferencia entre dar la mano y socorrer a un alma, y aprenderás que amar no significa apoyarse, y que compañía no siempre significa seguridad.  Comenzarás a aprender que los besos no son contratos, ni regalos, ni promesas...  comenzarás a aceptar tus derrotas con la cabeza erguida y la mirada al frente,  con la gracia de un niño y no con la tristeza de un adulto y aprenderás a construir  hoy todos tus caminos, porque el terreno de mañana es incierto para los proyectos y  el futuro tiene la costumbre de caer en el vacío.  Después de un tiempo aprenderás que el sol quema si te expones demasiado... aceptarás  incluso que las personas buenas podrían herirte alguna vez y necesitarás perdonarlas...  aprenderás que hablar puede aliviar los dolores del alma.... descubrirás que lleva años  construir confianza y apenas unos segundos destruirla y que tu también podrás hacer cosas de las que te arrepentirás el resto de la vida.  Aprenderás que las nuevas amistades continúan creciendo a pesar de las distancias, y que no importa qué es lo que tienes, sino a quién tienes en la vida y que los buenos amigos son la familia que nos permitimos elegir.  Aprenderás que no tenemos que cambiar de amigos, si estamos dispuestos a aceptar que los amigos cambian.  Te darás cuenta que puedes pasar buenos momentos con tu mejor amigo haciendo cualquier  cosa o simplemente nada, sólo por el placer de disfrutar su compañía.  Descubrirás que muchas veces tomas a la ligera a las personas que más te importan y por  eso siempre debemos decir a esas personas que las amamos, porque nunca estaremos seguros de cuándo será la última vez que las veamos.  Aprenderás que las circunstancias y el ambiente que nos rodea tienen influencia sobre nosotros, pero nosotros somos los únicos responsables de lo que hacemos.  Comenzarás a aprender que no nos debemos comparar con los demás, salvo cuando queramos  imitarlos para mejorar. Descubrirás que se lleva mucho tiempo para llegar a ser la persona que quieres ser, y que el tiempo es corto.  Aprenderás que no importa a dónde llegaste, sino a dónde te diriges y si no lo sabes,  cualquier lugar sirve...  Aprenderás que si no controlas tus actos, ellos te controlarán y que ser flexible no  significa ser débil o no tener personalidad, porque no importa cuán delicada y frágil  sea una situación: siempre existen dos lados.  Aprenderás que héroes son las personas que hicieron lo que era necesario, enfrentando  las consecuencias...   Aprenderás que la paciencia requiere mucha práctica.   Descubrirás que algunas veces, la persona que esperas que te patee cuando te caes, tal  vez sea una de las pocas que te ayuden a levantarte.  Madurar tiene más que ver con lo que has aprendido de las experiencias, que con los años vividos.  Aprenderás que hay mucho más de tus padres en ti de lo que supones.  Aprenderás que nunca se debe decir a un niño que sus sueños son tonterías, porque pocas  cosas son tan humillantes y sería una tragedia si lo creyese porque le estarás quitando  la esperanza.  Aprenderás que cuando sientes rabia, tienes derecho a tenerla, pero eso no te da el derecho a ser cruel.  Descubrirás que sólo porque alguien no te ama de la forma que quieres, no significa  que no te ame con todo lo que puede, porque hay personas que nos aman, pero que no saben cómo demostrarlo... No siempre es suficiente ser perdonado por alguien, algunas veces tendrás que aprender a perdonarte a ti mismo.  Aprenderás que con la misma severidad con que juzgas, también serás juzgado y en algún  momento condenado.  Aprenderás que no importa en cuántos pedazos tu corazón se partió, el mundo no se detiene para que lo arregles.  Aprenderás que el tiempo no es algo que pueda volver hacia atrás, por lo tanto, debes  cultivar tu propio jardín y decorar tu alma, en vez de esperar que alguien te traiga flores.  Entonces y sólo entonces sabrás realmente lo que puedes soportar; que eres fuerte y que podrás ir mucho más lejos de lo que pensabas cuando creías que no se podía más.   Es que realmente la vida vale cuando tienes el valor de enfrentarla!!!.  William Shakespeare

      Ok, she has been calling but i don't like to know that she is most of the time with that bitch pepito, i hate it and when she calls i know she only say the things that make me feel better. Last time she called she said "ok wait i'll call you later" so next time she calls and ask me what i am doing i'll tell her " i was waiting for you to call, i haven't slept cuase you said you'll call me later, so i was still waiting =P" and i wont say "just playing" =P I like talking to her, but i still want to be with her. =( At least my friend bofo is gettin with tania {hopefully, apparently yes} im happy for him.

      Men this is just as good as the first one, maybe even improved. But seeing both movies together is priceless, its a piece of art by Quentin Tarantino. Everything about both volumes is so great, i cant even believe that he wrote every move, he actually designed the fights and everything. I dont think any other director could have done this movie, only Quentin could have done this movie, any other director would be afraid to do it the way Quentin did.

      I dont feel, good. I hate that i cant even talk normally to my best friends, they are not allowed to talk to me so when we talk is in secret or very disguised, i hate that i cant just call them whenever i want. Two of my other best friends are on vacation right now, so i cant talk to them either. Im so bored right now, i have a lot to do but i dont feel like do it by myself. I want school to start already. At least i found out that im going to have phsicology with Susan! men that's good news for me. I want to fall asleep and wake up and find out its Monday already. Is not that i really wanto to go to school, its just that i want to see people and i want to finish high school already, so maybe i can go to europe and study industrial design, or architecture.

      Yes Uma kill Bill...this is like the best movie ever, maybe not, but it is one of my favorite movies i ever seen. It is true that, "vengance is a plate better served cold", i loved the revenge theme the movie had, and the way she is gettin her revenge. I dont know why i didnt see this movie before, i cant wait until aug 10 and rent Kill Bill Vol 2. I greatly admire Quentin Tarantino's taste and style of making movies. He has such a great vision on his project and he know what poeple want to see, well at least he knows what i want to see and how i want to see it. Ill never hesitate to see a Quentin Tarantino film ever again.

      Lo noto,Se que nos pasa algo , aunque selles tus labios, hay mal rollito entre los dos,lo noto.  Tu siempre estas cansada, y nunca dices nada, se que no estoy loco, y lo noto  me esta matando poco a poco,  y lo noto,  lo noto me lo dicen tus ojos, esos besos tan flojos, que dejan un sabor amargo y roto aunque tu me lo niegues, no queda mas que nieve, donde hubo calor y yo lo noto, puedo ser un cabron pero no un tonto, y lo noto.  Noto que mi corazon , no se, no va, que las miradas se caen, y que muere el mar, tu y yo tenemos que hablar, porque,ya se va acabando el aire entre nosotros, y lo noto.  lo noto, noto que me esquivas, que evitas mis caricias, que pones mala cara si te toco, y yo que estoy perdido, no puedo hablar contigo, y cada dia me siento mas solo, me voy hundiendo poco a poco, todo se va a la mierda entre nosotros, y lo noto  Noto que mi corazon , no se, no va, que las miradas se caen, y que huele el mal, tu y yo tenemos que hablar, porque,ya se va acabando el aire entre nosotros, y lo noto.

      I hate not knowing what i want and i hate not to be  brave enough to say what i want. Im so complicated sometimes, i could understand if someone doesnt understand me. Sometimes i act as if they could read my mind, hoping they do what i expect them to do, i hate that other people dont read minds... No, really i wish they could =P It would be much easier not having to say things.

      Last night i had this two weird dreams. Both had to do with Candice, but they werent very nice dreams this time, not like the one i had a long time ago were she said "i love you too" and then i kissed her.  This time in one of my dream she said something weird, she said something like " if you dont {do something i dont realy remember what} ill bang with anyone", and it was wierd cuase recently someone said that word through Candice's messenger but it wasnt her. And fuck now i dont remember the other dream  the only thing is that it was weirs too, but fuck i odnt remember i wish i could, i even wanted to blogg about his when i woke up but i had to leave to work. I hate dreams you forgget them as the day passes by. I wish I could always stay in the dream where she said " i love you too" and then kiss forever.
