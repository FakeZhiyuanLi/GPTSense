      Ahoy there fellow mateys!!  Yesterday consisted of many new entries to the annals of funny things.  Man, i need to think of a better name for those damn annals.  Anyway, i went to kerry's party, which was in freakin nowheresville, but it was worth it because i love her.  The place was great,  a lake for swimmin' and boatin' and lookin-for-snakes-n'.  There were numerous couches and tables for talking and playing cards, an indoor volleyball court, thousands of dollars worth of musical equipment,  and fooseball/airhockey/pingpong/pool tables as far as the eye can see.  There was an equally cool field for frizbeing, which we did a great deal of.  The highlight of the evening was the frisbee playing.  We had way too many people to play without confusion, but it was the crazed atmosphere that made it fun.  Jimmy and Chris Bopp were in a constant struggle.  Stacy was trying to pump her team up, until she gave up and joined chrissie on the sidelines.  Danielle managed to kick ass and dance at the same time.  Alex almost got sexually harrassed by a group of burly guys, and Moira almost got sexually harrassed by one VERY CREEPY burly guy (look on the bright side sunshine... *shiver*).  Me and Jackie played a lot of not-running-but-still-trying defense, and Bowyer kept messing with us and calling us out.    Oh, by the way, i decked bowyer  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha  There was a bonfire and lots of good times, and if i'm forgetting anything about the party, please leave a comment and tell me, it was really late when i got home and it's really late now, so i don't remember a whole lot.  Anyway, on the car ride home... i swear those s'mores were drugged...  Chrissie's dad was driving us home and somehow the conversation turned to 'fookies', a mysterious combination of ferrets and cookies.  Then i fell asleep with dirty, dirty feet from frisbee.  I'll leave you with a final deep thought  After you dip your dead ferrets in melted chocolate, roll them in cookies quickly, because that chocolate dries fast!!  Jess

      So here's the story morning glory:  I had a really stupid fight with my mom, that normally would have gotten me zero punishment, but since we were off to a high stress day at grandpops, and my mom was going 'mad' i was grounded.  Don't be so alarmed, it was originally two weeks, then one week, then the weekend.   Anyway, theres a lot of ground to cover.  As we were leaving school on thursday, me and alex managed to finagle TWELVE history books.  It was really funny to see a group of us each carrying one or two books around.  Just thought i should throw that out there.  On thursday, the last day of school, what do me and my dorky friends do?  Go to a bookstore.  Get this!  At said bookstore, we all decided we liked books so much that we would start a BOOK CLUB!!  Yeah, we're cool.  After the bookstore, we thoroughly destroyed Chrissies house.  After a rousing game of apples to apples (Awkward!)  we played a less rousing game of finish line.    P.s.  each paragraph is so short so that i get through the whole day, and so that you read all of them.  Later that night was graduation.  I didn't go, being in sucky mc suck suck choir, but my homies in womens choir  did.  Holla to the graduating class and mis amigos con hermanos y hermanas en el clase de graduacion.    At like seven forty five, as the storm of the century approacheth, i headed to alex's house.  Once people started showing up, it was really awesome.  We played a little cranium, played a little poker, and the boys showed us the darker side of the little mermaid.  All in all, a fairly fun evening.    Afterwards, we retired to moira's house as the boys settled in for a long night of losing money.  We watched pretty woman (which we borrowed from alex's house!) and promptly fell asleep after thirty seconds.  I wake up a lot in the night when i'm sleeping on a couch or the floor, and i'm usually freaked out by that.  But at moira's, everytime i woke up, there was an adorable dog at my feet!  In the morning, Mrs. Davies made us a rockin breakFEAST, and her little brother, the ninja, killed his friend in the garage.    I have been sticking to the bare bones this whole time, and i still have three days to cover?  crap.  Onfridaymeandmymomgotinthataforementionedfight,thenwedrovedowntograndpopstopaintchristinasbedroom.  Whoah, thats not gonna work.  Anyway, we sanded, caulked, and spackled our brains out.  I should really go into some background on this, or you won't understand the level of work involved.  The room at grandpops house that christina will be staying in didn't have what we call 'walls' before.  It had a form of blockage from the outside elements, but there were so many cracks and holes, that they didn't really constitute walls.  Don't even get me started on the closet.  I just wanna say that fifteen seconds in the closet would kill me.  Anyway, it took the entire day just to clean, spackle, sand, and caulk.  On saturday, Christina and Mama went back to wash the walls to get ready for paint.  If You think that would be a small job, you've never been to grandpops.    Sunday we painted, the fathers in our life stayed in the living room and watched tv while me, mama, christina, robbie, and eric painted painted painted.  Daniel played on christina's newly set up computer.  Ahh, i thinks thats everything.  I will post more later  Jess.  P.s.  IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO POST COMMENTS

      Mood: Triumphant return Movie o' the week: The Godfather, Part 1   The other day, lets call it oh, say, mr. thursday, Anyway, Mr. Thursday found me with some suprising free time, so i decided to mosey on over to my web journal.    Mind you, i had nothing to say, i just wanted to end the death threats.    anywho, i check my journal, and what, of all things, should happen? my computer freezes up!  I reboot, check all the whosiwhatsits and get back on.  I innocently try to read my journal, and it loads a blue screen (not the normal red) and then freezes.  Thoroughly confused, i decide to get on Bravejournals ass about it... still waiting for a reply  Aren't you glad to see that i've ended my time of 'hiatus' or 'sebbatical' or 'lazing my ass off"?  I sure have missed our time together, and as the end of the year approacheth, i figured you needed an upped dosage of MEEEE!!  In my time of 'not giving a damn' i have learned a few things about blogging.  One of them  is to personalize the mood music etc. columns.  I think that Movie o' the week (or day, or whatever) is better than music.  I just listen to too much music to put it all down, and frankly, i love movies.    So the movie of the week (really, the movie of every week when you think about it) is the Godfather, part 1, which i recently shared with some friends (and some idiots who showed up to TALK DURING THE BEST PICTURE EVER)   Another thing i learned is, keep it short and sweet.  Since i no think so grood,  You should probably enjoy this sweetness of the short post while its here.  To be seeing you soon, jess

      The 45620 reference is in godfather 1   before i begin the post, i'd just like to express my high regard for blogger advertising.  First off, it's very subtle, Just one banner ad at the top and an indulgent 'i power blogger' button on the side.  The 'i power blogger' think kinda rocks, cause it makes it seem like ONLY i power blogger, like i'm some sort of mastermind.  The banner ad is even cool, and i'm constantly clicking on it, cause its so specific to my blog entries.  For example, when my ben folds, rufus wainwright, and guster concert post was the most recent, the ad was for ben folds sheet music and rufus wainwright concert tickets.  When the harry potter post was the most recent, it was all about mugglenet.com and harry potter costumes.  very classy.  anyway, that concludes my little suck-up rant.  Wednesday and Thursday were soooo long.  My cousin alisa had a doctors appointment, and she left her two kids, pheobe and shjon (pronounced "shawn") to be watched by my sister and i.  Now, my parents were both working, and my sister can't drive, so we were stuck in the house with two insane babies (3 and 5).    Now, Shjon is hilarious and full of energy, but the child can not keep himself entertained for three minutes.  he'll pick a movie like the jungle book (whose name i didn't get until like, last year btw) watch it for ten minutes (not quietly, but punching things and acting like a monkey) and then get bored of it and turn it off.  Or even better, he'll LIE to turn it off.  We were watching Road to El Dorado (ooh, kevin cline and kenneth branagh singing!!) and halfway through he claims that his parents have FORBIDDEN him and pheobe from watching it.  He claimed that it was too scary for pheobe, and we would be in trouble for showing it to them.  Now, i know alisa, katie knows alisa, and she and her husband would never forbid their kids from watching a movie, he was just bored.  The best part about shjon is the way he acts with daniel.  When daniel was a young tot, he would bother my cousin's endlessly,  Chasing them around, making them play stupid games, generally being as annoying as possible to everyone (the latter of which he still hasn't shaken...).  So knowing this, its hilarious to see shjon acting EXACTLY the same.  Daniel was being a crank the whole day, requiring 'a bubble' and requesting that shjon let him have his 'me' time (which i call his 'drama king' time).   We told him to take his medicine and like it.  Then there's pheobe.  She is possibly the cutest child i have ever seen, and i'm not only saying that because everyone says she's me reincarnated.  She looks so sweet and cute, but underneath, she's a pezzanovante.  At least five times she threatened to backhand me, all the time saying "Straight to the moon, alice.  STRAIGHT TO THE MOON!!".    ah, they are cute, especially when they are looked at in retrospect.  However, after two days and two hours of sleep, me and katie were getting run down.  We could probably have handled it better if we hadn't given them such high standards of what to expect at our house.  Everytime that they come over, we always do something special, like buy them new clothes or walk to the playground or have a picnic.  Well, since thats all that we do with them, they aren't content to just sit down and watch t.v.  Now, i guess that curiosity and imagination are good things to culture in a kid, but they are not good things if you want to take a nap.  All in all, i was glad when the days were over.  Oh right, and thursday night, after they left, i went to night frisbee.  It sucked for the most part, because the hoodlums and bopp ditched us at the begining to go 'to a party'.  I think it might have been cause i was there.  Anyway, we tossed the disc for a couple minutes until my mom came.  When i went home, i found that 'go to a party' meant 'hang around in jess's culdesac which also happens to be mike burkes culdesac and play friz there instead of with the dorks at the y field'  My mom saw them there and very fittingly said 'fuckers' before pulling in the driveway.  see ya on the flip  jess  p.s.  post some comments, it boosts my self esteem  oh, also, visit Bowyer's blog and Moira's Blog (links located on right) because i remember how hard it was to build visitors.  Blogs are wonderful things, and it would be a shame if two people as funny and creative as moira and bowyer gave up their blogs because they didn't think they were making a difference.  My final thought, all of you who read this should start a blog.  it is a fantastic way to vent, and teaches you valuable lessons in procrastination.  Also, if you DO start one, i'll link to you on my site, and i promise to read every single post.  WOW!! it's 12:34!!  thats a sign for me to sign off  once again  Jess

      If you match one or more of these symptoms, you are a wanna-be wizard!   -To flick someone off, you use wingardium leviosa! on your middle finger (swish and flick!)  -You call your least favorite teacher Snape.  -You call your bedroom a 'dormitory', your family room a 'common room', and your cell a 'fellytone'  -You know one or more words of parseltounge  -You mutter lumos under your breath every time you turn on a flashlight... or a lamp, or flick a lightswitch, or open a car door at night, or plug in your alarm clock...  -You sort everyone you meet into the four Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff or Slytherin.) based on their personality (i.e. Katie=Ravenclaw, Me=Slytherin, Chrissie=Slytherin, Matt= Slytherin, Daniel=... well, daniel is the squib of the family)  -You call your sister a mudblood because she didn't start reading the books until the fourth one was out.  -You point at normal things like parking meters and computers and say "Look at the things these muggles dream up!"   -You claim characters.  -You start taking points away from people you know when they annoy you.  -The people you know start taking points away from you.  -Before getting up to get something, you always try to summon it first.  "Accio Kool-aid!"  -If that doens't work, you try to control your sisters mind with a curse to make HER get the kool aid (lazy girl... 50 points from ravenclaw)  -You declare yourself head boy or girl and immediately start telling everyone off for 'thundering'  -When walking down a street, you label run down shops and pubs as possible entrances into the magic world.  -When you mention that a certain shop has a probable affiliation with the world of magic, your family and friends agree with you, but then take 50 points from slytherin for your cheek.  -You spend hours tapping the bricks of those buildings in special orders hoping that a secret entrance to the magic world will appear.   -You collect plugs.   -You try on every piece of silvery fabric your mom has to see if you turn invisible   -You refer to your Chemistry class as Potions.   -You refer to Voldemort as "You-Know-Who", and no one has any idea who you're talking about.   -You were kicked out of the movie theater for standing on your chair, throwing your shoe at the screen and yelling "THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN THE BOOK!"   -You 'divine' that the sixth book is going to KICK ASS  -You count the days until you're old enough for your apparating license, and everyone else thinks you're talking about driving.   -You own what YOU call a wand, but what is actually a dowel, twig, or chopstick of some kind.  -You say "wicked" all the time because Rupert Grint does.  -Your family thinks your wand is wicked awesome. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Yeah, i'll be the first to admit i'm a harry potter geek!  but i'm not alone (Highest pre-ordered book in history)    Anyway, I've decided to benevolently acknowledge the begging of a fan on the message board.  I.e. I've found a place to host my pictures for free (with a little tweaking of the yahoo system) and i will be including them in my next post.    However, i'm working on something RIGHT NOW with my sister that i haven't told anyone about yet.  This will put btothethird to shame, if i can finish it before katie goes back.  Lastly, and this really has no bearing on anything, my name for the yahoo thing is piratejess45620.  If anyone (besides christina, who i told) can figure out what the 45620 stands for, they will get a prize!!    The Prize will be really cool, but the question is really hard  Hints:  1)It has nothing to do with my street address 2)It is not arbitrary   love n' kisses  jess

      I'm going to start out this post with something that alex imed me when i was away.   first, he accosted me with           sixstring46 (9:46:57 PM): Im still waiting for more Journal entries  and i responded with the witty retort           Cynical Cryptic [away message] (9:46:59 PM): Cleaning house, watching movies, the usual                                                                                             hit me up at home if ya wanna chat             sixstring46 (9:47:01 PM): including Burgundy   We went to see 'Anchorman'.  Best fucking movie ever.  I know i got kicked off of bravejournal.com for 'questionable language'  but i had to use the explative to express exactly HOW MUCH i love this movie!!  ...fuckity fuck fuck.  The movie is awesome, and funny, and damn awesome.  did i mention awesome?  I would write all of the one liners and plot points that made me laugh, but that would include writing a SCRIPT of the movie.  Just so you know, i will be owning this movie, and when i do, t-shirts will be made of the news icons.  then he said               sixstring46 (9:47:03 PM): poker  Now, this reference could be made to pretty much any gathering since april.  but i'm pretty sure that he was talking about wednesday, when we went to see dodgeball.  Then, to avoid a storm, Mrs. P sprung for chick-fil-a and we went to alex's.   Now, i might sound like a stoner now, but when we were at alex's, we watched Wizard of OZ with the sound off while playing pink floyd's dark side of the moon.  Holy Crap.  So many things line up with the music!! it's crazy!!! if you ever have forty minutes or a couple doobies you should try it.  Anyway, after we did that, we put the chips on the velvet and let the cards fall where they may? (dammit! who put a question mark on the end of the sentence?  you KNOW he'll read anything thats put on that telepromter!!)                sixstring46 (9:47:12 PM): my brother masterbetting under the table  Ok, this was just gross!!  Ben, alex's brother, put his hands under the table and started moaning!  Automatically i said "Benwhattayadoing?"  He looked confused, and then said sassily "what, i'm not in labor."  just to be clear, no one thought he was in labor.               sixstring46 (9:47:26 PM): 4th of July was SKIPPED  Ok, here his comments ends.  But he does have a point.  On the fourth of july, some of us frisb'd at his house, then met up with moira and fam at ludwigs field.  The fireworks were fantastic and about 30 yards away.  There was this kid joseph... well, just go to bowyer's site (likeafellin.blogspot.com) to hear more about him.    Since this post is already heavily based on what other people have to say about me, i think i should end it that way.  Check out Jimmy's latest entry in btothethird and my response to it to fully appreciate.              PCappy22 (7:36:24 PM): i just read your comment on jimmys blog on btothethird......can i be                a goon?!   Anyone who wants to be a goon, please file out the standard form and hand it to my caporegimes to join one of their armies.  don't even try to deal with me directly, the best you'll get is my consigliere... unless it's my daughters wedding, or you're important.  Don't mess with the family... pezzanovante.    I have more things to talk about, but i'm kinda tired....

      Would the jessica that you know and worship, Hungry and Tired after a day of walking around center city, stand in the rain for five hours for any amount of money?    In fact, i paid 37.50 for the privledge  Last night, the seventh, me n' sisters n' mom saw the Rufus Wainwright/Ben Folds/Guster concerto.  It was freakin amazing.  First we walked eight blocks in the rain to festival pier, not too bad, but then the rain picked up.  For an hour we stood in the rain, watching them squeegee off the stage.  Festival pier has no seats.  While we were waiting, we befriended some short girls who shared our unique problems.  We decreed that all tall people should stand toward the back.  a decree that proved useless when these drunk teens, i would guess they were newly graduated, shoved their way in front of us.  one of the short girls asked them if they could move over, and they did.  This redheaded girl moved over RIGHT next to me and pretty much had sex with her boyfriend right there.    Rufus was up first, and fighting an urge to call chrissie and ruin my cell phone, i listened to his beautiful voice and thouroughly amusing banter.  I also resisted the urge to punch the smacked-pack who had thankfully moved behind us, but were now making fun of rufus for being gay.  They were also talking about how they had gotten so smashed over the weekend, and how easy it had been to get the alcohol.  Ok, good for you, i'm trying to watch the triangle of rufus's head that i could see between some guys neck and some girls head.  Rufus had an off night.  I think he was put out by the fact that most of the crowd was there to see guster and ben.  The short girls we met definetly were.  When he started singing the moulin rouge song (which is in french)  the girls asked "is this in english"  katie said "yes" and they replied "were the other songs?"  Anyway, after Rufus was twenty minutes of standing in the rain.  During this time, a number of funny and infuriating things happened.  Firstly, my mother retired to the alcohol tent and we didn't see her again until the end of the concert.  Secondly, a couple tall people had gone home after rufus, giving me and my sisters (and my short friends) a perfect view of the piano where ben would be playing.  Unfortunately, this group of girls moved through in front of us, as if they were moving through the crowd to meet some of their friends.  But no no no, it turns out they wanted to stand RIGHT IN FRONT of us!  so i got to see ben when the girl in front of me turned her head.   I love ben folds though, so it didn't really matter that there were people in front of me, because it was so amazing to just be near the stage.  we were, at that point, roughly 20 feet from him, and by the time guster took the stage, we had moved up five feet or so.  Ben is also fuckin funny.  He made up a song on stage for us to sing along to.  He even brought out rufus wainwright to sing I'm never gonna dance again (the way i danced with you).  The best part of ben was when we sang army, a ben folds FIVE song, that required a brass section.  He didn't have a brass section, but in what i am told is tradition, the crowd more than covered.  The OTHER best part was when the rain stopped. ahh relief!  After ben, some people to the side of us left, and we scootched in their spot.  So i escaped the snotty girl in front of me.  Thanks to a very generous, very tall guy who stepped to the side, we had an unobstructed view of guster.  I don't have any good stories from this part for a couple reasons.  One: by this point, my knees and head and ankles were killing me.  Two: My purse was falling apart on the scene, so i was a little distracted.  Three:  I only know about three or four guster songs, so i felt left out compared to katie, who once worked a guster concert, and the stoners in front of me who knew every note by heart.  Well, i do have one funny story,  there was this psycho in front of me undulating.  At first i thought he was grinding his girlfriend, and because of my previous encounter with the crazy drunks, i was used to it.  Then I realized that it wasn't his girlfriend, and she was inching away from him! i tried to do the same, but the crowd was too close.  i had to clap to the SIDE to escape his ass.   When the concert was over, i lurched and hobbled the eight blocks back to the car.   We were starving, having brought chips and stuff to the concert only to be 'confiscated' by hungry guards.  We stopped at wendy's, made ourselves sick with greasy food late at night, and got home!!! yay!!  ok, well now you have a minute to minute account of my concert doings.  Congratulations!!  I'll post later today about my day in philly.  If you want to laugh, you'll want to read it.  Jess

      I have a week to cover in this one itsy bitsy post!! i don't know how people can stand waiting months at a time to update *coughbtothethirdcough*  Friday:   Moira's suprise party.  It was de-lovely, me and paul shouted 'don't hate us' instead of 'suprise' because she had made it fairly clear that she didn't want a suprise party this year.  I don't think she minded though! everybody had a great time, and i talked a lot more with erin and sean, two of the coolest kids not of our age.  I also saw indiana jones and the last crusade twice that night, once at alex's and once at my house afterwards!! (i have a problem)  Saturday:  Mama and Daddy were picking up katie, so me n' daniel walked down to wawa for our provisions.  needless to say, we had doritos for breakfast  Sunday:  Katie's first day home, we were all vewy vewy sleepy  Monday: Christians birthday, hooray!!!  the boys were very suprised to see me arrive almost twenty minutes early (my mom wanted to get there and back to bed asap) so i got to see a roomful of half-naked boys grumble about the time of day and play videogames before the sun came up.  After being hijacked from the byers car into mrs. davies', we drove for several hours.    then there was piddles  "hi.  My name is piddles.  I am a small white dog.  I am deaf.  If you see me, please call..."  i swear, if we had seen piddles, we would have stopped, turned around, and called the number.  What i want to know is, how could piddles be addressing you on his own lost poster?  the world may never know...  When we got to the lake, the boys started waterskiing while us gals paddleboated with about 200 extra pounds ("no wonder we're going so slow" "yeah, thats why we're taking on so much water!")    While they were waterskiiing, everytime alex tried, this psyco duck snuck up behind him!!  maybe he shouldn't have been so quick to judge sonja!!  she would get her revenge later...  speakingof animals, christians dog is rediculously cute!!!! when we took periodic breaks to play nintendo and eat, the dog would curl up on my legs and fall asleep!!  after like a minute, it would go into REM or something and flip over!! AWWWWW!!  Anyway  The girls took their turn, but we started out tubing.  We are the tubing MASTERS!!!  i have the bruises and rub-burns to prove it! Me n' Jackie got major air for the day, and me n' steph both got bruised  Moira decided to conquer every thing that can be pulled behind a boat ever made, while the rest of us either chilled on shore or cheered her on in the boat.  Me and jackie sat in the front looking very Ralph Lauren.  We went back to the house and set things on fire for a while, smores, wrappers, and especially pine branches which burn like a torch for twenty seconds.    We packed up, and were just about ready to go when the sun started to set.  It was so beautiful over the water that we scuttled down to the water.   Who should we find on the dock... but SONJA!!! and about 7 of her friends.  The longer we were there, the more ducks came!!    Finially, it wasn't just sonja, but  also artur, mihail, boris, dimitriy, fillip, leonid, igor, ivan, nikolai, oleg, aleksandra, anestasiya, inga, klara, irina, lidja, natasha, nataliya, olga, and veronika.  Not to mention the abusive husband of the battered wife duck.  After they tried to attack alex, we fed them bread, or in jimmy's case, threw things at them.  The sunset was beautiful, and we had a rediculously sleepy ride home, well, at least i did.  man, its 11!!  I'll finish this post tomorrow!!  luv y'all jess

      MY GOALS WITH THIS POST:  1.  Reader appreciation     A) Post my first picture ever     B) Respond to some commenters          a)Announce the upcoming "best comments" awards, also known as the "Jessies"          b)Doubt that the "jessies" will ever take place  2.  Tell the story of the big shots      A)Talk about my dad's play      B)Talk about the drunk actors  3.  Production update of movies      A) Pancake Tangent (working title of me and katie's movie)      B) Ice Cream Sherpa   Wow!! that was a thouroughly MLA'd list!!  Good thing i never returned my copy at the end of last year.  I got my report card though, and i think it was because i gave Mr. Dietrich the COOLEST DINOSAUR CARD!!!  it had a fossil of a prehistoric cave bear (that stood a little bit like him) and it was closed with a triceratops sticker that said "that's nice".    Before i start, i'd like to introduce you to a new blog, her name is chrissie's blog, and this is her first time on the internet.  I'd like you to give her a warm welcome.  Alright chrissie's blog, you can take your seat now.  I believe there's one right in front of moira's blog in the links on the side.     1.  Reader appreciation  I'm gonna talk a little about your comments, and to kick things off, i'm going post my first picture ever!!    At 10:56 AM, Anonymous said...        haha wow jess, you sure talk a lot...great picture up top btw        lisa    Its funny lisa, i have a great picture of you too!!     I also have a pretty cool picture of paul       ok, next comment   at 6:36 PM, billyd said...        Oh and just a word on Mr. No-Neck-Ripkey...        Please don't tell me that you learned something from that horrible piece        of crap teacher    *me interrupting.  No, i didn't, i just threw myself into working on the computer to avoid using my senses around him.  shudder*          First off, the guy never got over how "crazy them punk-rappin'-skateboardin'-nosepickin'-tamagotchi-playing kids are these-a-days."  He was constantly complaining about how kids don't recycle and get strange rushes from hanging their butt cheaks out their pants.  God he would never shut up about it.     *Totally right on this point.  But in my case, it was worse.  I had him for homeroom, and it was filled with what he considered prime examples of kids these-a-days.  Just a guess, but you probably had him in the first half of the day, when he was still reeling from our homeroom.   Not only would he get on his soapbox about it, but he would try to talk to ME about it, as if i was the only sensible one in the room.  I would move computers and go to theonion.com.  Anything i could do to avoid him*          Plus, he really knew jack shit about computers.  Everytime he pronounced gif with a hard G like "gift" i would cringe.  It's pronounced "jiff"    *well, he's an idiot, and a douchebag, what do you expect?  All of his HTML projects had mistakes in them too.  HUGE mistakes.  thats why no one's pages worked and they all looked like shit when ya finished*    Supprisingly though, some teachers google their names to see if anyone makes fun of them.     *Maybe you all have been wondering why i have stayed on the topic of Mr. Ripkey in this post.  It is in the hopes that he googles his name to see if anyone makes fun of him.  My Highest aspiration with this blog is to see Mr. Ripkey's enraged reply to this post.   Maybe if i mention his name enough, it will show up on google.*      Alright guys, final comment for today   At 10:19 PM, chris said...      I had to make a comment so it would be the 5th one.  YOU BETTER POST NOW OR I'LL BEAT YOU WITH A SPATULA AND HAD YOU BY YOUR EYELIDS!!!!...I'LL EAT YOUR SOUL TOO!!!MWHAHAHAHAHA     *wow, thats just...  beautiful. *      Alright, now it's time for the story of the big shots  My dad's play is excellent.  It consists of two charachters named Mara and Jake.  One is an assistant speech writer, one is an immigrant janitor.  On the day of the reading,  The first three guests, Jefferson, Carl, and Jessica were scheduled to arrive at noon.  We would do an initial reading, break for lunch, then discuss until the 'constructive audience' arrived at three.  After rampantly cleaning house all week, katie and matt had to go to scranton for his grandparent's 50th anniversary, so it was just me and my parents (my brother, at this point, would say "what am i, a next door neighbor?")  My dad was being a nervous nellie, complaining about everything he had to do, while standing in the entrance to a room with his coffee saying "Theres some marbles on the ground there.  Yep."  After I called him 'Efficiency Jim' and thanked him for micromanaging, he decided he had better go food shopping to get out of the house.    The first reading was splendiferous.  Jefferson was Jake, Jessica was Mara, and Carl (the director) was there to take notes.  My dad also took notes, while my mom read stage directions and I timed it.  Every five minutes i wrote down where we were, so they could time scenes and tighten up the dialogue if they needed to.  Now, the first reading was excellent.  Jefferson was superb, despite the fact he needed to do an accent, and this was the first time he had seen the script.  Jessica however, was not so good.  She didn't completely understand her phrasing and the script seemed a little beyond her grasp.  We figured that she would tighten it up a bit before the second reading.  The reading was great.  Artistic managers, directors, and artistic assistants as far as the eye could see.  Jessica was still off though, and managed to make everyone in attendance confused about Mara's charachter.  But otherwise, it was a very informative and constructive meeting  it was also funny to see myself running around like a little maid, i refferred to myself as a slavechild more than once.  With my parents playing host, there was no one else to set up plates, refill bowls and glasses, refresh hor de... ordvou... ORDERVES.  The most hectic part of my job was during the second reading, when i had to be laying out platters of lunchmeat and vegtables WHILE keeping up with the script and writing down every five minutes.  after the reading, my mom popped open the wine.  as six o' clock (and my appointment at the fair with chrissie) drew nearer, the bottles got emptier and emptier, and the discussion turned from the play to wedding pictures of my parents in 1977.  When i left with chrissie, i was not sorely missed!!

Well, it's almost over and i believe i've met them.    Anyway  We have a solid plot now, and it's fairly funny.  However,  we have to re-tool some scenes for conflicting schedules.  as for ice-cream sherpa, i have a plan for him.       ANNOUNCEMENT:  Anyone who would like to see the ice-cream sherpa in full production:  Write a short history of the ice-cream sherpa.  Grammar and spelling do not count, length does not count.  you may submit more than one entry.  entries may be stupid.   The winner recieves a starring role in the movie.

There was no winner of the last competition, because everyone who would have guessed, i told.  i'm an idiot.  45620 is a reference to Long Beach 45620, or the phone number of the godfather's compound.    well all obscenely long things must come to an end.  happy hunting!!  jess

      As i promised, this post will start out with a MAJOR btothe third promo.  I have decided to do so in the form of a song.  (please sing to the tune of britney spears' smash hit "Toxic")   check out btothethird.c-o-m it's awesome i'd go there right now it's a cool way to keep in touch with friends I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic? at least when you update, you should do it more often.   now, i wouldn't have put in the last line, but how else would it rhyme?   Anyway, back to reality (oops there goes gravity)  You'll have to bear with me, my memory is a little fuzzy seeing as it's after one and i've been on my feet all day.  I do remember going to see the villiage (which sucked) but at least i kept people from getting scared (myself included).  Katie and Matt played drunk for y'all, and i have to thank all of my friends, all of whom advised me not to get in the car, most of whom offered to give me a ride home.  you should know that from a family of actors (...and matt) that we could fool y'all if we wanted.  MAJOR EVENT OF THE WEEK well, as probably none of you know (with the possible exception of mrs. davies, who i told in the car when she asked how involved in the theater our family was)  my father has been spending a lot of his time writing a play.  It is his second play, and his first production to be produced in it's entirety (the first scene of his first play won a ten minute play festival).   What does this have to do with anything?  well, this weekend we have invited some philly theater elite (including the artistic directors of three theaters) to attend a readthrough at our home.  AKA an opportunity for my parents to chill with their homies, impress the philly theater community, and fix my dads play all in one go.    Well, with so many people coming, we have been scourging the house, making it fit for human habitation.    so we have been cleaning or getting things for this party toda la semana.  no jokes.  I put my computer skillz to use (in getting out of real work)  to make an interactive visual database for mi padre.  He needed to scan and organize the actors, and i did him one better, including each of their contact info's and resume's.  All this in a handy little powerpoint.  you may ask how i know this,  well, besides my obvious genius, i learnt it in computer class.  I had to do something to keep myself distracted from hearing, seeing, or smelling mr. ripkey (*shudder*).  the point of this is, my mom told some people at the arden about it, and they might make it my graduation project.  (they currently store headshots and resume's in five filing boxes)  Anyway!   In getting ready for the party, we got rid of our sixteen year old couch (i'll miss you mr. springs-popping out the bottom!)  and We bought a new couch for the living room!!  well, COUCHES to be fair.  instead of one big one (what we traditionally have had)  we now have two loveseats facing each other.  tre adorable!  i have some great couch buying stories.  First off, we went to about a million stores, each more boring and footsore than the last.  When me and katie got bored, we went over to what looked like a high-class-business table and passed random papers back and forth, looking important and discussing our movie.*****see bottom of page for movie update... or just, ya know, wait till the end***  When we didn't find anything anywhere, we dropped by the new Raymour and Flannagan, despite their gouge-my-eyes-out commercials.  There we were occosted by TONY.  TONY is a very tall man, who i am SURE was trying to conceal a hunchback.  He had a very deep, slow, and creepy voice.  Now, this wouldn't be so bad, except for his shifty, shady eyes and easily excitable, stalker-like manner.  Also, i'm not altogether sure he wasn't hitting on my mom.  well, he kept turning up around corners when we least expected him, pushing sodas on us (date-rape-drug-city i'm sure) and talking about fabric guarantees.  Katie called him a shark, because he was always behind us, pretending to mind his own business, and then he'd circle and STRIKE.  one time, we were walking by the end tables, and i was sure we had lost him.  Me and katie couldn't crack jokes about him while he was around, and we both knew the other was holding them in.  I say something about pillows and then quickly whisper "I think he's out of earshot" "No!" she answers "he's here... somewhere"  All of a sudden he closes the door of a wardrobe he was pretending to inspect RIGHT IN FRONT OF US and asks us if we want to talk plaid.    This was a shady, shady man, and me and katie couldn't lose him fast enough, so we were glad when my mom decided to get us some pizza (by now it was seven or so) to wait for my dad to get home.  We ate at RInos, and met up with my dad when we got back to R&H.  Tony was there, but he had another potential sell (TWO middle aged ladies)  and he handed us off to his young apprentice.  This kid wasn't so creepy, in fact, the only time he creeped us out was when, just as we're about to go upstairs, we noticed him across the store on the computer.  We walked about ten feet to the stairs, then climbed up.  HE WAS WAITING FOR US AT THE TOP!!!  ...one staircase in the whole place...  Anyway, my dad was hungry and cranky from working and not-eating all day, so whenever we expressed a preference about sofas (i.e. no poufs at the top, no faux-suede)  he snapped at us.  One time, when i said "look at this room, pouf-city U.S.A"  and then a couple minutes later katie said "Wow, this room is main street Pouf-ville" (blatant joke stealing!!) my dad turned on us and seethed "Girls, we have decided to spend a lot of money today, calm down, this is NOT AN ICE CREAM STORE".    it took all the strength we possessed to keep straight faces, and from that point on, anytime we'd see a poufed faux suede piece, we'd wride ice cream orders like ' 1 chocolate' in the fabric.  My dad was being kind of crazy that day.  when we were looking at a couch that they were getting serious about buying (i still didn't like it)  i said so.  I said these words "i don't think i like this couch too much"  My dad turned on me and said "JESSICA!!  STOP IT RIGHT NOW.  STATING AN OPINION IS ONE THING, BUT MAKING FUN OF A SERIOUS PURCHASE IS ANOTHER!! YOUR MOTHER AND I HAVE MADE UP OUR MINDS AND MAKING FUN OF THAT IS MAKING FUN OF US. DON'T YOU REMEMBER LAST TIME WE WENT COUCH SHOPPING?"   ME: "what?  um. no?" I had no idea what this had to do with anything.   turns out he yelled at me was because he 'remembered'  me making fun of him a year and a half ago, when we were buying the family room couch, which is why i was so confused.  see i wasn't there that night eighteen months ago when KATIE called him a baby because she cracked a joke and he threw a hissyfit.   I didn't get in trouble, and it wasn't that big of a deal, but for about half an hour i was thouroughly confused.  when we actually bought the couches, i was also thoroughly shocked.  before i continue, i should explain that me and my sister play a game (i'm the best at it) in furniture stores.  One of us points out a piece of furniture, and the other has to identify what piece of literature it bests belongs in, where specifically, and why.  Yeah, we're dorks.  so my mom had been very keen on this red patterned couch, it was very griffindor common room, covered in these kind of gold emblems and patterned with other faded color diamonds (patterns are HARD to describe)  Well, i didn't much care for it, but its partner was a tan number that i thought was stunning, so that was at the top of our list.  as we walked for a final check upstairs (to see if we missed anything before we bought them) katie pointed out these blue checked ones for me to identify.  It was very obvious that they belonged in maycomb county, in the living room of one atticus finch.  we kept walking, and after the vomit-plaid-don't-make-fun-of-purchases-blamed-for-katies-outburst, i found myself back at the blue couches!!  My parents loved them and took them home dat veery dai (said amerigo bonasera style)  Ah, it has been almost an hour since i started this post, and i am sleepy.  i don't wanna be cranks for the big shots tomorrow, so i'm going to bed.   The only other things of intrest that happened to me this week were not that interesting, except for the notice at the bottom of the page.  Well, once we met a squib at walmart (he stirred the paint for my room) and me and katie made a wand for matt for his birthday, but other than that, nada.    I promise i'll write about the bigshots after they leave manana.  In the meantime, visit a newly reactivated btothethird and LEAVE SOME COMMENTS.  if you don't keep up the record of at least 5 comments a post, i won't post until there are 5 comments.   jess    *****Movie update******  we have written a script and animated a production company logo.  This movie is NOT the ice cream sherpa movie (though i am in the midst of writing a script, four pages down, w00t)  this is a flash cartoon-turned webcomic-turned short film that me and katie star in.  It all stemmed from a discussion we had about pancakes, but i will tell you no more.  ok, i'll tell you two more things.  1. We need a site to host it on, so you may not see it until then  2. It doesn't have what some movie coinesseurs would call a 'plot' seeing as it was a comic at one point.  the plot is loose, but we're planning to make it more of an episodial thing.
