      This week is a busy week at work.  We have a deadline to meet by Friday so I think every night tonight will be a late one.  I FINALLY finished the Stock Web Animation for that movie gig I'm working on.  It literally tooks me 10 hours of straight work, but it's finally done.  Life is pretty good right now, I can't complain.  My parents are going through a small law suit, but I think we are going to end up winning (although we are paying $400 a second it seems).  I got a chance to catch up with a lot of my old friends this past weekend.  My Friend Kimmy had a graduation party on Saturday, so I saw a bunch of people there.  We all promised we'd stay in touch but you know how that can go sometimes :).  I'm really going to try.    Also Congrats to Niki for a great performance on Thursday night! She's gonna do real good on the Music Circuit.

      Okay ... So i have a foreign being (also known as a pimple) that has decided to inhabit my nose. IT IS HUGE and disturbing.  Everyone notices but doesn't say anything (except for Sean of course who is a DICK by nature).  Anyhow it really sucks.  What's even more distrubing, is tomorrow i have to get my picture taken, and our little nose dwelling friend has come right in the nick of time!  I was complaining about this earlier to my friend NikiG who can relate to the issue so has given me lots of products and advice to remove this nuisance.  Hopefully it works.    Anyways enough talk about my damn nose, Weekend was great! I got a chance to spend some time with my family, which i don't really get to do anymore because i'm pretty busy.  I ALSO saw Spiderman 2 which I thought was absolutely AWESOME.  I swear they can do no wrong with that movie.  It will win some kind of award and definitely has earned the right to be in my DVD collection (or my DIVX for that matter ;)).    Tomorrow is my Friend Cassie's Brithday, so we are all going out to Sushi at Blowfish in LA.  I love sushi so i'm going to go to town.  Last time I was there I saw Tara Reid and Dean Pritcher from Old School ... Mabe I'll get lucky again :)  This weekend should be nice as well.  Post more later.

       urlLink      Sean and I have a great friendship. I've known him since I was 12 and we still get a long great!  Here is an example of the kind of friendly dialog we share each day:  AstralFX (2:35:10 PM): hello my baby Fraghouse (2:35:28 PM): feel free to die  Feel The Love&nbsp; urlLink
