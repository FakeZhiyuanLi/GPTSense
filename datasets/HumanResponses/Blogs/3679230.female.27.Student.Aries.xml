      One thing I absolutely LOVE about Sweden is how much money is pumped into public things like libraries.  The best feeling I think I know is being between 7 and maybe 19, still being in school, and going to the library on a Saturday and coming back home with an enormous stack of books, unpacking them on the hallway floor and then try to decide which one to read first.  And then you end up taking two or three books with you because you just can't decide.  I went to the library yesterday and even though it wasn't a Saturday and I went on my own, it was still a good feeling to unpack those books.  I started reading three different books, I couldn't decide.  I never feel like that when I go to the library anywhere else, never felt like that in London, never in Ottawa, never feel like that in Melbourne.  I think that's because the libraries there seem so unloved with their 70s brown wall-to-wall carpet that's breeding mold and screaming kids who never learned you're supposed to be quiet in a library and people hanging around the computers, thinking using the internet is the reason you go to the library and the rows after rows with paperbacks which tell you whoever decides about what to buy needs to buy the cheapest possible.  I miss the peace and the bright and sunny buildings with plants and all the newly published books you can imagine.

      I went into GÃ¶teborg yesterday and spent 24 fully packed hours with my friend L.  Going back to my mom's today I took the tram from her house to the bus station and on the tram I overheard this girl talking to two friends.  It was a good conversation, she was talking about two books she had read recently (The DaVinci code and Oryx & Crake) which happen to be books I read pretty recently as well, so it was interesting listening to what she had to say about them.  Then she went on to talk about the previous night and going to some bar.  What was so weird was that I could totally relate to what she was saying and particularly HOW she was saying it.  It felt like I was listening to myself - she was talking about stuff I would talk about in the same kind of way I would talk about them and she reminded me of myself.  I found myself sitting there wishing I could get to know her because she seemed like the kind of person I would be good friends with.  It was a bit strange but it felt good.  I looked at her when I got off and she wasn't particularly attractive, not the kind of person I would find attractive anyway, so that wasn't it.  It was more that from the 20 min I heard her talking it seemed like we thought about the same kind of stuff and in about the same kind of way.  Last night I went out with L.  It was fun but it reminded me about how differently Swedish and Australian people 'go out'.  We went to a party, which wasn't that fun in itself but it was still fun because it was like a high school party.  It was actually exactly like a high school party even though I'm guessing the youngest person there was about 22 or so.  I didn't envy the people who lived there - there would have been a shitload of beer cans to clean up the next day, the living room table was just covered, not to mention the kitchen.  There wasn't an empty surface.  Very high school.  Everyone was doing their uttermost to get as loaded as possible and me and L just kind of fell into it as well, it was weird.  She pulled out this bottle of whiskey or whatever kind of vile yellowish stuff it was and started mixing it with Pepsi and when that was gone she pulled out some beers (this after we had polished off a bottle and a half of red wine with dinner at her place and a couple of shots before going out).  I couldn't remember a time in Melbourne when the focus was so squarely on drinking but it was so easy to fall into, like I knew all the social codes and I knew exactly what we were doing and why and what my role was at this party (i.e. find someone else who also didn't know anyone and start a conversation with them).  Man, I felt so much like I was back in high school and it felt really safe and secure in a way, because I knew exactly what was expected from me, at the same time as I kept thinking, This isn't really something I would choose to do normally or something I enjoy that much.    Talking to L was great as well.  Before she leaves the house she has to do her hair and her face for like 45 min and every time it makes me laugh because I take 10 min tops to get ready but she has to look pretty before we go.  But for some reason it doesn't bother me, again it just makes me feel safe and like I know the codes and what's going on.  I feel so relaxed here and I wish I could feel this way in Melbourne.  We talked about stuff like that - her bf is British and he's wanting to maybe move back there, and she totally doesn't want to at the moment.  Anyway, what she's worried about if they do move to Britain is that she wouldn't have anyone there except her bf that she felt 100% connected to and whom she knew well, kind of like my situtation right now.  It's so great being around people I know well and who know me and who know what I did 10 years ago and what my life has been like up until now.  I don't have to explain myself all the time.  It's really relaxing.

      Before moving to Australia my gf and I lived in Canada for two and a half years.  One of my really good Canadian friends and I have had a long ongoing email discussion about 'home' and what the heck that is, anyway.  Is Canada your home if you're a hyphanated Canadian (i.e. a German-Canadian, an Indian-Canadian or a Ukrainian-Canadian)?  How does race place into this - do 'other people' consider it more quaint and cute when the Ukrainian-Canadians keep their traditions for a century than when the Indian-Canadians keep theirs for a couple of decades?  Are the non-white Canadians required to make Canada 'home' more and quicker than white immigrants?  Is Sweden my home even if I spend 11 months out of 12 away from it?  I don't know.  We never figured it out.  Maybe home is a concept and not a geographical place, 'home is where the heart is' and stuff like that.  I'm supposedly 'home' right now, that is, I'm in Sweden.  I'm not entirely sure that's home though.  Home is my apartment in Melbourne.  Melbourne feels a bit like home as well.  Australia, however, isn't home but Sweden is.  But there is no place in Sweden that's home.  At the moment I just want to go home to my chook, but at the same time it feels like home would be anywhere she is.  I did field work for my thesis all of last week.  I went up to Stockholm and hung around a study tour that was part an international development project for Ukrainian women.  The whole purpose of me being there is trying to figure out how these women see gender and gender roles and if a project like this one can ever change values and norms in Ukraine.  But what was really weird is that I closeted myself throughout the whole thing except for one conversation when I was a bit drunk after a dinner and was talking to the Swedish consultants.  While these Ukrainian women were mostly really progressive in their gender thinking for being Ukrainian I just couldn't bring myself to out myself infront of everyone.  They are SO focused on family, family is really important to them, so when they heard that I live in Australia because of my 'partner' everyone wanted to know all about my life there with 'him'.  I never said yeah, it's a guy, but I never said anything to make them believe the opposite either.  I spent a week trying to talk about my chook in gender-neutral terms.  That's really shit and I shouldn't have.  Live as you learn blah blah.  I guess I just didn't feel confident enough to do it and it pisses me off.

      Over the weekend my friend J and I went to see H, this girl we went to school with.&nbsp; I haven't seen her since we graduated from high school and that's seven years ago.&nbsp; She was never my kind of person but man, she was strong, now that I look back at it all.&nbsp; She was the first gay person I knew, and she was out in high school&nbsp;-- god, imagine being out in high school.&nbsp; Imagine the shit you would have to take.&nbsp; How strong you would have to be to be able to handle it.  We met up with her and her girlfriend, well, actually, her wife, but I'm having such a hard time taking that word in my mouth and making it sound like a serious word.&nbsp; I think I can't understand I'm old enough to have married friends.&nbsp; They have an 8-month-old baby, a boy, and they had him using an unknown donor.&nbsp; I wouldn't have thought that of them, well, not of H, anyway.&nbsp; From what I knew of her I would have thought she would have been one of those who praised the need of a male role model.&nbsp; I would have thought they would have had it with a known donor/a friend or&nbsp;even a male couple.&nbsp; I think it's really&nbsp;brave of them to turn their back on the heteronormative&nbsp;ideas about 'a child needs a mother and a father' and 'a child needs a male role model'.&nbsp; To just say, well, this is our family and this is what it looks like.&nbsp; Seeing them with that kid made me&nbsp;see that he's&nbsp;going to be loved to bits.  Meeting up with them made me realize (for the thousandth time) that I want to have children, but that's about where the thought process stops, the rest of my life is pretty un-sorted.&nbsp; I want to have a child with an unknown donor as well for two reasons: less legal headaches since the donor couldn't change his mind and demand 'his' child 'back' or demand different conditions in relation to the child&nbsp;than those inititally agreed on, and it would be my and my gf's child, no one else would be involved. Having a child with a male couple is not an option for me.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; I understand why people do it -- it gives the child a mom and a dad and that's what they 'need' and it makes straight people accept it more readily.&nbsp; But it wouldn't be my gf's and my child, it would be some guy's and my child, with his and mine partner as supportive step parents, and that's not what I want.&nbsp; I want a family with my gf, not with some guy.  I guess a known donor would be the ultimate option.&nbsp; I have read enough about test tube babies and adopted children to&nbsp;understand that a person's biological background is&nbsp;important, it's something your child is likely to want to know about to understand who she is.&nbsp; I think this biological hang-up&nbsp;is a socially created 'need' -- there are cultures where biological parents aren't important and where&nbsp;biology isn't seen as creating&nbsp;your identity.&nbsp; But I live in a culture where biology  is  important, in which people search for their biological parents to understand themselves, and I have to assume that my children might feel this need as well.&nbsp; I don't think it's a 'right' to know your biological parents but I feel that taking the&nbsp;option to know&nbsp;away from your children might create problems for them.&nbsp; And I don't want to do that.  At the same time, having children is a selfish act.&nbsp; I'm selfish enough to want to have them in the first place, so why wouldn't I be selfish enough to create the family I want to have, namely me, my gf, and our kids?&nbsp; Without anyone else involved.&nbsp; It would be more difficult, more trying to involve a known donor.&nbsp; The amount of trust you need to place in that person.&nbsp; Where do you find someone you  know  wouldn't demand access 'his' child in a way you wouldn't be prepared to accept?&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone who also would need to play the part of an 'important person' in your child's life -- not the role of a father, but someone your child knows and respects.&nbsp; I don't know a single male person I would place that much trust in.&nbsp;

      I found this  urlLink young gay guy's blog  and he had found a good quote in response to someone talking about not 'believing' in homosexuality: 'What do you mean, you "don't believe in homosexuality?" It's not like the Easter Bunny, your belief isn't necessary.'&nbsp; I love that.
