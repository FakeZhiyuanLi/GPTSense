             you are seagreen  #2E8B57         Your dominant hues are cyan and green. Although you definately strive to be logical you care about people and know there's a time and place for thinking emotionally. Your head rules most things but your heart rules others, and getting them to meet in the middle takes a lot of your energy some days.  Your saturation level is higher than average - You know what you want, but sometimes know not to tell everyone. You value accomplishments and know you can get the job done, so don't be afraid to run out and make things happen.  Your outlook on life can be bright or dark, depending on the situation. You are flexible and see things objectively.         urlLink the spacefem.com html color quiz

        101 Facts About Me   Yippee.    I love filling out surveys.  I am currently worried that I won't get as far as 15 on this list.  I take alot of online quizzes.  I have made several online quizzes of my own.  I drink almost a gallon of water a day.  I love being a vegetarian.  I love road trips.  I  hate  when girls use the excuse of being on their period when they do something horrible or are irritable or whatever. I mean really. That's so stupid and that's no excuse. Actually, that's just what it is. An excuse. Holds nothing.  I blush deeply all the time.  I don't get sick very often at all.  I don't complain when I do get sick.   I don't complain much at all.  I'm confused by the actions of most people, I don't understand how I can see something one way and they see it so differently. I think I'm right though and that confuses me more.  I'm quiet. I used to be super shy but I kind of grew to this comfortable-quiet-by-choice thing that works for me.   I have a grudge against the United States Postal Service.  I love junk food.  I love typing.  I owe most of what I am more or less to AFI. I would elaborate on that but I don't think I will.  I'm very picky when it comes to books.   I wish I still watched as many Disney films as I used to when I was a kid.  I live in the middle of nowhere.  I have the rest of my life planned out.  I'm worried about graduating even though I'm extremely excited.  I'm very independent.  I'm all about internal torment.  I'm strange when it comes to how I treat other people.   I pay attention to what other people do so if I see something about them I don't like I won't do it and if something they do that's good and I like it I'll be sure to try and do the same.   I never liked playing Hide-and-Go-Seek.  Not many of my relatives like me at all.   I'm comfortable around strangers but super awkward around people I know or people I know I'll see again.  I do well at school but I don't try and I wish I did because I wish I did better.  I don't buy clothes often at all.  My family doesn't have any money.  Society and humanity sadden me.  I have alot of self pity, self loathing, and self deprecation.  I was born in England and have duel-citizenship.   I want to live in Canada.  My favorite movie is Rocky.  My top favorite types of music are punk and indie.  I'm lazy and hate doing alot of things but I do it anyway.  I do alot of things I don't want to do.  I'm very wishy-washy and don't like/can't make decisions.  I think I'd make a good president but I would never vote for a woman president and so it'd be hypocritcal to run for office.  I hate feminists. They get on my nerves.  I don't have a definetly opinion on almost anything.  I'm for abortions. In the end the kid is probably going to suffer if the mother doesn't even want the kid. It's preventing alot of kids from being neglected, stuffed in a dumpster and all that.  I used to be big into anime and manga but I'm not anymore.  I can't draw but people say I can and it makes me mad.  I don't have a talent or gift or excel in the slightest bit at anything.  I think Glenn Danzig has to be the coolest person alive.  I recognize May 18th as a day of mourning.  My favorite song is Mini Trucks Suck by AFI. It's the greatest.  I've been listening to Jane's Addiction alot as of late.  I'm listening to it now.  It kills me when you're looking for something and can't find it and then it turns out to be right in front of you.  The other day I had these two paper clips on a bag of Cheetos and I took them off to put some Cheetos in a ziplock and then I looked down and couldn't find the clips. I just set them on the table right in front of me for a second and I looked all over the kitchen and couldn't find them to save my life. I just don't know what happened to them.   I sing 24/7 but I don't sing well or anything and I always sing these hard songs that sound awful in my girl voice.   One of the happiest days of my life was the last day of gym class in 10th grade because that was my last year of Physical Education needed.  I would have set fire to my gym clothes but my mom wouldn't let me.  I save my movie ticket stubs.  I keep little things that will remind me of certain things in this locked box.   Examples of things in my box are: a plastic spork, a piece of a stick, money order receipt, medal.  I take latin in school and am pretty good at it but not spectacular or anything.   Je ne suis pas francais.   I went to a private school until 4th grade then I went to a public school until 8th grade then I switched schools again and that's where I currently am.  I'm a Future Business Leader of America.   I love making mixes but I don't know anybody to give one to.  In my last school I made two best friends and we were still close last year and most of this year but then I think things kind of fell apart. I don't know how they feel though but I haven't talked to either of them in weeks and I don't think I know much about either of them anymore so I always feel weird to still call them my best friends.   I'm a loser.  I look like a loser. I have the acne, glasses, braces, flat chest, old clothes. I'm a loser poster child, I am.  I like old punk rock alot.   I feel like brushing my teeth, showering, and going to the bathroom are a waste of my time and I never feel like doing it but I do anyway.Like I said. I do things I don't like doing alot.  I like low-budget horror films alot.  English is my favorite subject in school.   Latin is my favorite class though.  I'm on AIM all day but I normally have an away message up the entire time.  I think I'm a lot more tolerable and accepting than most people.  I'm self-righteous.  A lot of times I will talk about something (normally always music related) to somebody and I know they have no idea what I'm talking about but I do it anyway because I kind of try to show off how much I know about what I'm talking about. I know I do this. It's kind of hard to explain though.  Everything I do I know exactly what I'm doing.   I'm very mean to my mom but I'm not really to my dad and she knows this and it makes her sad. I make my mom sad alot and I know I do but I do it anyway - I know what I do but do it anyway.  I don't really know why I do that actually.  I have this wierd thing where I don't stay mad. I see other people who are mad for days over something but when something makes me mad I'm mad for like a second then it's over, it's done and I don't care anymore. It's kind of strange. I just don't stay mad. It's not that I do it on purpose, not really, I just don't see the point of staying mad over things. Let it go. Let it be.   Unfortunetly the same thing happens with all of my feelings, so if something makes me happy I'm only happy for a second then it's over.   I hate talking about religion.  I live for cold weather.  I am currently on summer break from school.  I don't really have any plans this summer, I never do.   I hardly ever have any plans.  I don't go anywhere with anybody. I'm just a loser that no one likes.  I honestly don't think I'm too hard on myself. I think I'm too easy.  I went through a bad time when I thought I had to punish myself for things but I've worked on it and I don't anymore.  I have been watching an average of 3 movies a day this summer break.  I want a job to bring in more income to my family.  I don't like wearing shorts. I never wear them in public.   My CD player is so messed up.  I want to go to the public library. Especially now that school is out and I can't use the school library.  It takes me a long time to adjust to things but I eventually always do.  I don't like change.   "Stick to what you know" is my motto.  I'm surprised I got this many facts about myself and doubly surprised that I could probably add more.

        Your element is Rain: Sad, lonely, distant and unique. You are quite distant from emotion and people, but you have been made this way by one thing or another. Your are truly unique yet fail to see it, and are quite creative be it in art, music, writing, etc.. You used to let people in now you don't even bother to try having been hurt so many times in the past. Your attitude is that you don't need anyone but yourself, people are just trouble waiting to happen. But you really do want to trust someone no matter if you see it or not, deep down your waiting for someone to come and set you free. This kind of depression can turn dangerous, don't let them get to you. Not everyone in the world will hurt you, humans are humans and are not perfect. So most likely sooner or later you'll meet someone who feels like you do and perhaps your shell will eventually disappear.    urlLink   .:-|What is your true element?|-:. -With Anime Pictures and detailed answers-     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       Put your playlist on shuffle and write down the first 25 songs that come on and say why you like them.    1. Sparta - Cut Your Ribbon  - Raw, intense.  2. AFI - The Last Kiss  - One of the best AFI songs ever. Fast, hard, good lyrics. I can't say I'm not sad more AFI songs were like this.   3. HIM - Gone With the Sin  - I don't listen to very much HIM because it's too popular now and I can't deal with that very much but I still love this song. It's very smooth and soothing.  4. Interpol - Hands Away  - I don't know what's so great about this song exactly. I like how calm it is. It almost sounds mysterious. "Oh, what happened." I love that.   5. Vanessa Carlton - Twilight  - I was wondering if any of my Vanessa Carlton songs were going to come up. I should have known. I love the girl. I love her voice and her piano. Some songs aren't so great but some are amazing and gorgeous. This is one. I'd go to a Vanessa Carlton concert.   6. Anti-Flag - Bring Out Your Dead  - I love putting songs on shuffle - I go from Twilight to this. I like this song for the same reason as the first two. Fast and hard and intense and a little raw, but not like Sparta. I like best when the title is sung. "Bring out your DEEEEAAAAD."  7. AFI - Crop Tub  - Oh man I love this song. Brings back loads of memories. "Fuck you very much." I thought that was just about the greatest thing ever, I still like it alot actually. Then after all the bad things from the song directed at whoever at the end is, "Have a nice day." I would say that it "tickles me" but I know that doesn't quite fit so I'll just say I like it.   8. Cursive - Sink to the Beat  -   I like the ending best but the whole song is totally awesome.   9. Generation X - Dancing With Myself  - This is on my Generation X CD and Billy Idol's greatest hits but I ripped it from Perfect Hits (Generation X) and it is a little different so I just put that. I love Generation X and Billy Idol and this is one of the best songs. Billy Idol can make me feel giddy as a schoolgirl. (I am a schoolgirl, really...but you know the expression.)  Useless note:  In Latin class we wrote Valentines for V-Day and I didn't have a Valentine so I decided to do someone famous and did Billy Idol. Ha.   10. AFI (cover) - Demonomania  - I was on a roll when I was putting all these AFI songs on and I just copied the entire A Fire Inside EP. This was one of the first AFI songs I heard and I like the song no matter who does it but I like AFI's version, they did good. Horray.  11. AFI - Of Greetings and Goodbyes  - What's up with all the AFI songs showing up in the first 25? Anyway, this is one of AFI's finest if I do say so myself. I used to always leave my computer when I went to bed so I could leave the away message of, "Go kill the lights! We'll glow til morning comes. I'll say goodnight and bow to everyone." It was great. I try to save electricity so I don't leave my computer on at night anymore. The little light on the CPU annoys me, too. It's too bright.   12. Refused - New Noise  - Oh boy I love this song. This band was so innovative and unique. I love all the crazy and experimental things they put in their songs. This is one of the best. I especially like the beginning, "CAN I SCREAM?" and the end, "THE NEW BEATS THE NEW BEATS THE NEW BEATS THE NEW BEATS THE NEW BEATS" and so on and so forth then he says, "Thank you" and drops the mic. Good stuff.  13. Blondie - Call Me  - Show me somebody who doesn't love this song.   14. Danzig - Am I Demon  - If Glenn Danzig had anything to do with it I'll probably like it.  15. Interpol - Say Hello to the Angels  - I like Interpol. The away message I use half of the time on AIM is the first few lines on this song, "I want your silent parts. The parts the birds love. I know there's such a place. I had my back turned. You didn't realize I'm lonely." This is one of my favorite Interpol songs (notice it's on my playlist).  16. AFI - Girl's Not Grey  - Gah. Who doesn't like this song. I don't care who you are, even if you don't like to admit it (>me  17. I Hate Myself - This Isn't Tenka-ichi-Budokai  - I love this band. I love this band a whole lot. This was the first song I heard and it's still one of my favorites. It's so sad and powerful. This guy can scream. Whatever broke his heart really did the job.  18. The Cure - The Lovecats  - Best Cure video ever.   19. The Damned - Fan Club  - This is my second favorite Damned song. I like how Dave Vanian's voice is so laid back sounding.   20. Alkaline Trio - Mr. Chainsaw  - I love the lyrics to this song. Most of Alkaline Trio's lyrics seem just like good poetry. This is one my favorite song by them. Favorite lyric parts of the song: "I found out recently that you're leaving. For good, I hope, I softly tell my ceiling." "I took a hammer and two nails to my eardrums long ago before that steak knife took my eyes." "I guess I should be one to talk. There's nights that I can't even walk, there's days I couldn't give a fuck and in between is where I'm stuck." Then the last lines. "In case you're wondering we're singing about growing up, about giving up and giving in."  21. AFI - A Single Second  - Gah. More AFI. Honestly. I like the harmony with Nick13.  22. System of a Down - Spiders  - Only one of two songs I've heard by SOAD. Are all the songs as great as this one? This song is amazing. I love the guitar solo. Love the guitar solo.  23. Morrissey - Irish Blood, English Heart  - Horray for Moz's new album. I know this is one song from You Are the Quarry alot of people are talking about. It's very good.   24. The Misfits - Teenagers From Mars  - I have so many Misfits song on my playlist I was wondering if any would show up. The Misfits are like AFI where it introduced me to alot of stuff that I got a kick out of because it was so "bad" or whatever. That sounds stupid but I guess it was kind of stupid. "The insemination of little girls in the middle of wet dreams." Far cry from Billy Gilman. Ha ha. I'm surprised I just admit that. He's a country singer, if you don't know.  Note:  I had to look up  insemination  when I first heard it. It's okay to laugh.  25. AFI - Mini Trucks Suck  - Woah crazy ending this with my favorite song of all time. I still smile when I think about the time I had it on my AIM profile and this guy said (I'm pretty sure this is exact), "Sweet mother of god child" and I was like, "What?" He said, "Your profile." I'll put the lyrics because I'm bored and they are the best AFI's ever written. "Mini trucks suck. Cross the street in your mini truck. Mini trucks suck. Stupid piece of shit. Hip hop fuck. Cruising with my new whore. I'm outta beer and I need more. Marijuana has got me high. Can only be heard when I need pot. Look at me, I said you're a prick. Flip off me - you wanna suck dick? Stand right there I'll fucking hit you. I'll take this hit you back, hit you back, hit you back and slam right into a pole. Mini trucks suck. Cross the street in your mini truck. Mini trucks suck. Stupid piece of shit. Hip hop fuck. Like to cruise when I know I'm poor. I'm a regular at the liquor store. Max out the stereo, pump up the bass. I buy girl shit. Wanna drive in a race. Think I'd rather fuck a chump. Need my beer and a little joint. Friend's are easy - they don't shit. Down and suck, down and suck, down and suck...at least I'm getting laid. Yeeeeah boyeeeeeeee. Mini trucks suck. Cross the street in your mini trucks. Mini trucks suck. Stupid piece of shit. Hip hop fuck." That was from memory, I'm almost positve I didn't forget anything but I was doing it while distracted.

       1) Using your Current Initials, choose a different name for yourself.    I can't think of many names beginning with "E"   2) If you were born outside of your era, when would you want to be born and why?  70's. I'd want to grow up in the 80s, and be a real old school fan of bands I like.  3) If you ran a store, what would you sell/have?   Music records  4) What part in a movie would you love to play?  Some quiet but complex character  5) In your opinion, why do people suck?   Why don't they?  6) If you had your own state, what would you put on your new quarter?   Whatever meant alot to the state...  7) Whats the oldest article of clothing you own?   That I still wear? Almost all of my jeans I've had since 7th grade (I'm in 11th now...kind of sad)  8) What piece of furniture have you replaced the most?   I'm not sure...  9) What instrument do you wish you could be more than great at?   Drums or guitar, possibly the flute but I gave that up  10) Record, Tape or CD?  I use all three, but CDs are more accessible and more convenient to use so that'll be my first choice.   11) What do you think would be the best concert ever? (max: 4 bands)   AFI, Refused, Swingin' Utters, and Danzig-era Misfits. (Not that I don't like the new stuff). That'd be a super concert.   12) What's the best part of your favorite movie?   In Rocky, when the theme song plays while he's training. Like when he runs up the steps. So great...ha ha  13) What do you think is the most over-rated candy ever?   Snickers  14) If you were writing out your will, who would you give your CD collection to?   I'd want to spread it around...but I think Lauren would probably like the most CDs I have out of anybody I know  15) If you could only debate two topics the rest of your life, what would they be? Bands selling out. The causes of the downfall of humanity.  16) Out of your friends, who would you say you are most jealous of, artistically?   I don't really know...the only thing that comes to mind is Amanda's flute talent but I don't play anymore so I don't really care  17) Most jealous of....intellectually?   I kind of like the way I am now with that...I'm not incredibly smart but I don't know if I'd want to be  18) What do you collect?   CDs?  19) What is broken that you have, that you wish was fixed?   My old CD player  20) What do you do when you're home sick?

Unique questions  22) Story behind your username?   Which one? I'll go with blogger I guess, since that's where I'm posting this. Driedflowers is my name, I think. I got it from an AFI song "I remember when I was told a story of crushed velvet, candle wax and dried-up flowers" Crushedvelvet was already taken, it was my first choice though.   23) Current Favorite Article of Clothing?  Joy Division, Love Will Tear Us Apart shirt perhaps  24) Line from the last thing you wrote to someone?  "Okay have fun, bye" over AIM  25) A famous person you have met?   I don't think I've met anyone famous  26) Favorite way to waste time?   Watching movies I suppose  27) Last thing you bought yourself?   Movie tickets

      I hope everyone out there is getting ready for Adam Carson's Birthday. It's February 5th! Let's think of things one could do to honor The Adam:     Go pirate for the day  Listen to Tiger Army's early stuff  Drink Red Bull  Kill Aaron Carter for having the same initials  Be fascinating  Play drums  Laugh amazingly     That's all I could come up with at the spur of the moment.   You all do know who Adam Carson is, right? Drummer of AFI. The band.

      The first six weeks of first semester is for taking notes on cards for our big ol' research paper in English. The topic is three colleges that will help you get to your chosen career. At first I didn't know what I wanted to do at all so I just picked something cool, "Recording Engineering"  I found the most awesome college in East Bay so I was getting all excited about that and the thought of being a recording engineer is cool but I just don't think I'm cut out for it, and I have to admit it.  But I was going along with it because the colleges for it are specific for it and are easy to get the information from. Especially the one I was researching in East Bay.  But then in Computer Programming class we had to make up a business and I totally forgot about my career idea that I had for a few days during the Summer before my dad shot my dreams up saying that it was risky business so I just forgot about it.  But I've been thinking about it more and more and I just think I would be the happiest person I could be if I could do this.  All I want is to own a small indie record/music store somewhere in an underground part of a city like Washington DC, somewhere in CA maybe, somewhere.   I was thinking about it and I think maybe DC is best, depending on where I go to college I think though.  So after much debating I decided to risk switching topics half way through the six weeks.  It's harder because thse aren't little specialty schools, but it's worth it because this is what I am for sure going to do so I might as well get ready for it now.   So the colleges I'm doing are Longwood, VCU, and Berkeley.  Longwood is there for a nice local college that I know for sure I could get into.  VCU is probably my best bet. I'll probably end up picking that one. Because they talk about "Small Business Ownership" alot in their course description which is EXACTLY what I want.  Berkeley is there because I like the location. And I'd go there for two years then hopefully get into the Haas Business School.  So I'm hoping to major in Business Administration.  The only problem with all this is you know, with business you need all that team work and leadership crap.  Man that's my biggest downfall.  But I really want this.   I imagine this little store, that all these subculture kids come in and they find their music and it's a friendly nice happy atomosphere. Just full of the air of music. Not the sound of music, but the feel of CDs and albums and records. Maybe you dont' feel that but I do anytime I'm in the music section of any store. I could live in a music store. I can spend hours just browsing, not even buying anything or seeing anything I want, just being there is enough for me. I think I would like to live back behind my store in a little dim room with a bed in the corner, and a little microwave and refridgerator in the corner.   I get all tense and anxious and excited just thinking about my little store.  Oh you don't know the kind of happiness it would give me if it could be exactly like that.

      The bad thing that happened yesterday that was going to make the next weeks or so horrible   totally unexpectidly   cleared up. I cannot believe my luck at all. This never happens at all. I don't know what to think at all.   And I'm in pretty good mood. I was looking at my 5th grade class picture.  MAN . We all look  SO  young. And back then we thought we were all old and grown up. It's so funny and strange. I don't know. It's weird. But I was looking at Amanda. She was so cute and sweet and dorky in 5th grade. I wish she was still like that. Instead of so concerned with seeming the best and cool or whatever she thinks.   It's sad.   But whatever, I still love her to death and if that's how she is I have to accept it no matter what and I do.

      My oh my. What have we here? Could that possibly be a 'lovely' imood with a  rainbow  happy smiley face? Yes, yes, I do believe it is.  The weather is amazingly lovely outside I just feel pretty darn good. The survey I sent out in an email had a question asking to say something nice about the person that sent the survey to you and I have gotten really nice things. It's really great.  I don't know. Haha A lot more little things that have been making my day really great. Nothing really good/big have happened, it's just all the little things. These are the best days for me.  I just feel good and it's really really nice. I really hope nothing happens to change this good day...that's what always happens when I am having a good day for once.

      My life is so boring.  I used to not care, but I guess I could only take so much. Now I can't take being bored all the time.  But there isn't anything I can do about it.  I just have to keep on living like this, as much as I  hate  it. Maybe something somewhere along the line of life will happen and make my life a little less boring but I seriously doubt it. It'll never happen.

      I want so badly to go see a movie. It's so boring without school. As much as I hate it, I don't really like sitting around and doing nothing either.  There are things I could do, should do but aren't and won't.   Anyway, about the movie. Here in the middle of nowhere there is only one theatre close enough and it only plays 3 movies at a time and they are "Barbarshop 2" (ew) "You've Got Served" (haven't heard of it but it has B2K in it, so definetly no) and then "Catch That Kid" which I haven't heard of either and haven't heard anything about. So I can't go to a movie. I just have to sit here counting the minutes until I can fall asleep.  I'm pretty sure we'll go to school tomorrow. Heck, we could be in school now. That's why I wish I could go to the cinema, because the roads are just dandy.   Ah, I was going to say something but I don't remember what exactly.

      Interesting conversation at lunch today. I was sitting alone in the library reading. These three girls sat across from me.  	 Girl 1:  Hey, do you tell on people for eating in the library? 	 Me:  No...(Had this look telling her I thought what she just said was extremely lame) 	 Girl 1:  She doesn't get to eat (motioning to Girl 2)  		Blah blah blah they were talking joking about her not eating at home, how she was like one of those Ethiopian children (real funny)) 	 Girl 2:  What is HiFi? (Looking at my Hoodie that said "AFI", the string was in the middle of the A, making it look like HiFi apparently) 	 Me:  AFI. It's a band. 	 Girl 2:  Is it like that Slipsnot or something? 	 Girl 1:  Yuk yuk yuk. Slipsnot. 	 Me:  No 	 Girl 2:  What kind of music is it? 	 Me:  Uhm, I guess...kind of punk rock 	 Girl 2:  Like Linkin Park? 	 Me:  Linkin Park isn't punk. 	 Girl 2:  Well what is it then? That's my band. Blah blah 	 Me:  Kind of rap rock I guess. 	 	Blah blah.   Another interesting conversation with darling Shelby: 	 Me:  do you have trouble sleeping at all? 	 Shelby:  yea 	 Me:  aww :-( 	 Me:  Im sorry 	 Shelby:  i used to not really but its like my THINK time lol 	 Shelby:  now i'm sorry! that u have trouble  	 Me:  what? yeah it is think time to me too  	 Shelby:  us Thinkers ... gunna kill us from not enuff sleep lol 	 Me:  hehe 	 Me:  yeah haha

        HAPPY 29TH BIRTHDAY ADAM CARSON!!!     Friday tomorrow!  I have to figure out what 'dream career' I am going to pretend I want to write my paper in English by tomorrow.  This could be kind of fun. Taking a random job and writing a research paper on it, pretending that what I desperately want. Maybe I should think of something totally off the wall. That would be awesome.  Maybe I'll say I want to be an astrophysisist. Or ah, I don't know. Maybe a mailman. That would be fun to research colleges about!

      I was going to wear my Tiger Army shirt tomorrow but then I remembered (how could I forget???) tomorrow is The Adam Carson's birthday. Wait. Is it? Wow that would be so horrible if I got the date wrong. I'll have to check.  But I'm pretty almost postive that's right. Of course that's right.  Yeah.  February 5th, 1975 Man I was thinking it was the year 2003 and I was like "Oh, he's turning 28? I thought for sure he was turning 29. Oh well" Ha Ha. Stupid new year.  If you don't know ways to celebrate The Adam's birthday, look below and find my list.  Anyway, like I was originally saying, I have to wear AFI something tomorrow. I don't think I'll wear my hoodie. Probably just a shirt. But which one??  I can never remember when the last time I wore whichever one I wore. I think the last one I wore was the Fall Children...yes, I think that was actually this week.  My days and weeks run together. Because they go to slowly.  I don't think I've worn the In Darkness Together one in a while. But maybe I have? And I'm thinking I hadn't worn the BSITS one in a really long time but I think I have. I KNOW I haven't worn the wings one in a while but I don't want to wear that one. I think I'll wear the In Darkness Together. I guess. Yeah. Most likely.  I think I always get more excited at other people's birthdays then my own.

      My computer makes this weird high pitched sound. It hadn't been doing it that badly lately, but for some reason (I may have just been imagining it I don't know) but it was at the worse last night. So I wanted to turn off my computer but I saw that my video was downloading nicely so I thought I'd just put up with it. But then I got up about 45 minutes later (it was about 1 now) and it had 3 minutes left. So I just sat there and waited and it finished and I turned off the computer. I got in bed and I was saying to myself how quiet it was and how nice it all was (keep this in mind - the irony is killing). I had been leaving my computer on for the past week so today was really quiet and nice. Then I heard that stupid dog bark. That piercing sharp short bark cut the night. Man. Then he started barking more and more and pretty soon the two other dogs joined in too (joy joy!!)!! So this went on about an hour. Then I finally decided there was no way I could sleep with that (I can't fall asleep with any noises) so I got up out of bed and opened my window (they were right under my window!!) and banged on the screen. Sarah came running in all mad because she thought someone was breaking into the house (but she was already awake because the dogs woke her up). Banging on the screen didn't help. I went downstairs mad as hell not knowing what I was going to do, but I opened the door and the cold took my breath and any ideas I had away. So I was kind of jumping around on the porch (it's a concrete flooring) because it was too cold to stand still. I whistled for the dogs and when they came running I just whispered "be quiet" and went back in the house and shut the door. They were quiet after that. Thank God. But by then it was 3ish. I finally fell asleep around 4. Got up at 6:20 and I don't feel that bad. I don't sleep much and don't really need it. I'm always tired, I mean, so it doesn't make a difference. I had a headache before I even got off the computer and it hasn't gone away, though.   My mom, sister and I were talking about last night's events on the way home today and Sarah said she was in bed so scared when the dogs went quiet. She knew that I had gone outside and she knew that I don't like the dogs and are already mean to them. She said she knew that I didn't shoot them because she didn't hear a gun shot. She said she honestly thought that I went to the kitchen, got a knife and slit the dogs' throats.   When I was in bed listening to them bark I had all sorts of crazy notions in my head. I was imagining myself ripping out their voice boxes so they could suffer SILENTLY. I know that's mean. I'm a bad person, I never said I was a good one.  If they do it again tonight, I don't know what I'm going to do.   I don't know what they were barking at though, but me and my sister both heard the dog on the corner barking so that's probably the reason. Whenever they get into nightly barking fests it's always to the other dog on the corner I am pretty sure. They've done them before, but on weekends when I don't care as much and also they've never done it that much or that long before.   I wish I could blame my headache on getting only 2 hours of sleep last night but that's not it because I know I had it before I went to bed.   They are calling for a 'wintry mix' tonight. Everything was cancelled - basketball games, ACE matches, etc. Lots of folks think we won't be in school tomorrow. I don't know. I kind of want to go because if we miss any day this week we are going to school this Saturday. And I like my Saturdays, thanks very much.

      The purpose of this post is to continue to put off studying for my Driver's Ed exam tomorrow. Also to help not think about having to go to school tomorrow. I hate Mondays. Tuesdays are no better. Wednesday get better. Thursdays aren't that great because there is hope, and that little bit of hope makes it seem okay but then you realize you still have to go the next day. Fridays are pretty good 3:04PM and beyond. The favorite part of the week is Friday late afternoon/evening.   So I thought since I've been watching some of the music videos I've downloaded, I thought I might update my 10 favorite music videos of the month. And I thought I'd share them here with anybody who cares. Now, I don't have MTV or VH1 or anything like that, so the only videos I get to see are the ones I download. I've only downloaded about 20. So it might not be that I'm partial to AFI videos (maybe it is because they are my favorite band and all) but those are the majority of the ones I've downloaded and all. You know?      " Friday I'm in Love " by The Cure  " PDA " by Interpol  " Karma Police " by Radiohead  " Girl's Not Grey " by AFI  " He Who Laughs Last... " by AFI  " Totalimmortal " by AFI  " White Wedding " by Billy Idol  " Silver and Cold " by AFI  " The Leaving Song Pt. II " by AFI  " There There " by Radiohead

      "Just when you start to smile, I look into your eyes and see your veiled denial to express any real emotion. Just wait around a while - you'll lose what you once had for me. I'll be out of style. I'll be discarded with the warmth you once feigned.  So eager to say "hello" but you don't know me. You just know what you see. Pay the price to see the show but you don't own me.  Before you knew, would you have felt the same?"  "Please don't ask me just what I think, trust me, you don't want to know. Please don't ask me to open up, trust me, trust me, 'cause I can't."  "Everything's so easy for you, but I've struggled to get this far. I'm alone in the fight. What's wrong, who's right? I take it all to heart. Your true colors start to show, you call yourself a friend. The teams are drawn, you chose your side - you'll get yours in the end."  "Another day so hard to face."

But I apologized.   She forgives  ME . Doesn't say anything for herself...guess she didn't do anything wrong. Whatever. Man. People totally blow. Why is everyone so selfcentered? Everyone thinks they are right, they don't ever realize when they in fact are the problem. It's stupid.  Geez.    Oh, she says sorry for making my weekend bad. Well, gosh, how sweet.

      Oh yeah, There is this girl I know who is always talking about how 'punk' she is (you know those type of people...) And she was saying how she used to be so into pop and stuff but know she's into punk. I told her that she still listened to pop. It was mean, I know, but I couldn't help it. I knew I would say something one day or other. And being worried and upset with Amanda made me go over.  I feel bad about it, and don't want to confront what she says about it but I know I'll have to because it's lame to run away from things like that.

      Amanda's mad at me... I hate it when someone's mad at me, especially my closest friends because they are the farthest away.  I don't really think I did anything wrong. Now I don't want to sound self absorbed or stubbord or conceited or whatever you can get out of it, but I really honestly think I didn't do anything wrong at all. And I've thought alot about it. But, regardless of this, I did apologize sincerely and a number of times, claiming it was  my  fault.   No reply.  Fine. Whatever. Be that way. I apologized and did all I could, it's all up to you now. I can't do anything about it. Just wait it out for you to cool down and forget about it.   I'll wait.

And Interpol's CD. I think that's right.   4. What four things do you need to do this weekend? Should have asked this last weekend...Uhm...Read some, Finish homework, Take Driver's Test, Find my pants.  5. Who are the last five people you talked to? Sarah, my mom, Shana, Ashley, Romulus.

      I'm so worried about the FBLA competition Thursday. It would be semi-alright if we didn't have to eat dinner at the cafe. I asked Amanda when I found out, last Thursday, if she could meet up with me there. So I let my damn hopes get up and thought it would be alright.  But she says today she has to do like something or other, 3 things, I was too disappointed to really comprehend anything for a minute She said she was sorry. "i just don't know what i'm going to do..." She said to go and have fun and inserted a grin face. "hi...have we met...i'm no good around other people...i have a low selfesteem..." something else, don't remember exactly She asked was there going to be no one else I knew there. I said that was right. Me: "it's okay" Me: "it'll be okay" Her: r u sure? Me: "itll be alright" Her: good :)   It's not going to be alright, I didn't mean it when I said it, but she always takes that as an answer and doesn't press it.  That makes me feel bad.  I'm tired of her always being so busy all the time. I don't understand how someone could be so busy and have so much going on. It makes me sick and sad and disappointed.

      I have a crapload of Algebra II homework tonight. I was just going to get my mom to pick me up from school at 10:20, during 2nd period, so I would have gone to Algebra II and part of English, but I don't want to do my Algebra homework. So my problem is whether to do my Algebra homework or not. She never checks to see if you have it.  But what if I come in Thursday and she asks me for it? I asked to people what they would do, and one said nope, they wouldn't do it. The other said yep, they would. Great. I guess I am going to have to make this decision for myself then. I'm going to say no. I'm not going to do it. I'm going to sleep in and go to my orthadontist appointment then 4th period.  I'm not doing my Latin either... I wonder what'll happen Thursday with that...

      March already. Can you believe it?  Download this song now. Right now. Or buy the CD for it. Whatever just listen to it and think about the lyrics.  	                 "Cold Cash and Colder Hearts" by Thrice  		They are sick, they are poor 		And they die by the thousands and we look away 		They are wolves at the door 		They are not going to move us or get in our way 		Cause we don't have the time 		Here at the top of the world 		Cause we're feeling alright 		Here at the top of the world 		 		We hold our own by keeping our hearts cold 	 		Different god, darker skin 		They are just not a burden that we'd like to bear 		They are living in sin 		There are so many reasons for us not to care 		 		Cause we're feeling alright 		Here at the top of the world 		Yeah, we're doing just fine  		Here at the top of the world 	 		We've learned that money matters most 		So we keep our cards held close 		Here at the top of the world 		 		We hold our own by keeping our hearts cold 		We learned what matters most so we keep our hearts cold 		They are no one 		They are no where 		They are not our problem 		Not worth saving 		Nonexistant if we keep our hearts cold  		They are no one 		They are no where

        Gettaload of these lyrics:   Schoolyard freaks are freezing, down getting teased again I'm looking back and down and watching it go by Down at the stockyards cattle screaming The trains squeak by again I can feel my breath and I'm so thankful I'm not one of them  The sound of the ground freezing is pounding once again It comes with the wind that once wiped off our smiles Alarm clock bells are screaming out the same routine again Scrape open your eyes, rise and fucking shine, 7 AM  Sit down, dead weight, and wonder Unsure, unslept, uncovered The new light of dawn discovered by ungrateful eyes, Through 5-3 eyes  Schoolyard freaks are freezing, pushed to the ground again I'm looking up and west for black to fill the sky The sound of bottles breaking still breaking in my ears They opened just in time to empty out And gouge away the years  Sit down, dead weight, and wonder Unsure, unslept, uncovered The new light of dawn discovered by ungrateful eyes Through 5-3 eyes  Schoolyard freaks are bleeding, down getting kicked again I can taste the earth and feel it in my eyes The sound of cattle screaming, still screaming in my ears They came in metal coffins -  Chained me up and hacked me of my years  Sit down, dead weight, and wonder Unsure, unslept, uncovered The new light of dawn discovered by ungrateful eyes, Through 5-3 eyes -Alkaline Trio

        It's okay...   Go me, I did three paragraphs on my big report. I'm proud. I'll probably do the 4th and 5th this weekend or the end of this week if I don't get much homework this week (hah.) The only reason I got to do it today was I had already done my homework during school. I'm glad I got some done.   I can't believe it's Tuesday evening. For a moment I felt like it should be further on in the week but then I felt like it was Monday. So I guess it's where it should be? I don't know.   I don't know what I'm going to be doing this weekend, I think it's something but I don't know what yet...I have to sort it out...I kind of want to do nothing at all since I had such a long tiring week last week but then had a just as packed weekend so I really do need to get a nice relaxing weekend in. I don't know.  I thought we had an essay in English due at the end of the week but I found out it was only the rough draft...it was on Much Ado About Nothing and I think mine turned out pretty well. I'm kind of proud of it. I'll have to see what my teacher thinks of it...

        Nothing ever lasts   What an odd mood I was in last night. It was like I had my lousy, low mood but it was being covered by the happiness. Now all the happiness is gone and I'm left with the depressed/sick at myself mood. I think it was all that Mountain Dew I drank. I think it was the caffeine and sugar. It was a good feeling though. I guess it just shows that caffeine really is a drug and it did give me a strange reaction. I don't think it's as prevalent in other people because they drink it all the time. I rarely ever drink any caffeine and yesterday I was relatively overdosed on it.  I feel lousy. What a lousy day it's been. What a lousy person I am.

        HORRAY!!!   I don't have my Latin Book!!!!! I have an EXCUSE for not doing my homework!!! Not an excuse for class but an excuse for myself!!! That's good enough for me!!! I'm so happy!!!  I think I figured out why I'm in such a hyperish/cheerful mood (I am using EXTREME self-restraint from typing all of this in ALL CAPS).  I have ALL this caffeine and suger  surging  through me. Just surging around in my body, slamming around in my veins and stomach or wherever the heck it goes!!!!!! WHOOOOOOOO!! Yeah, that has to be it. I'm am super hyped up.  HORRAY FOR SUGER AND CAFFEINE AND MOUNTAIN DEW IN PARTICULAR AND BAD SPELLING AND ALL CAPS AND AH, ALKALINE TRIO AND OTHER GOOD CDS I OWN AND MORRISSEY AND THE CASSETTE I BOUGHT YESTERDAY OR WHEVER THE HECK THAT WAY. I BOUGHT A CASSETTE!!!!! I'M SO EXCITED!!! I LOVE UHM PASTE!! NO I DON'T LOVE PASTE I LOVE...AH...TISSUES!!! SOFT TISSUES!!! ALOE OR LOTION TISSUES!!! AND CEREAL!!! SUGARY CEREAL AND HIKES UP MY MOOD LIKE THIS!!! I LOVE CEREAL! YES, I DO, I LOVE YOU TOO! BUT MOSTLY CEREAL!!!  I have to go back to my homework again. I hate myself. I hate homework and school.

        As you can see...   Whee for titles. See? I can do 'em too! Go me! Anyway, as you can see my IMood is "Bizarre"  I feel super super lousy/guilty/ashamed/horrible/sick/miserable but I also am feeling way more cheerful/happy/content/lovely than I have been in ages.  So I'm confused.  I feel good though! But I feel bad too... But I feel good! But I feel bad. But I'm oh, so cheerful! Then, I'm oh, so depressed and feel like I've made myself sick with myself. Now, it's happened before that one minutes I've felt super great, then the next minute I felt terrible, but that's just puberty, or I was feeling good but then something/someone put me down in the dumps unexpectidly. But right now it's BOTH at the SAME time. I'm not emphasizing those for anyother reason than I am hyper and feel like EMPHAZING certain words, but NOT emphazing OTHERS. JUST the IMPORTANT ones.  I hate myself. I love myself. See?  I've never said "I love myself." And I don't. I don't know why I said it. I hate myself. What was I thinking? I was just proving a point that I'm split personalities at the exact same time. I think. I swear I don't love myself, but I think I'm okay. But I don't like myself.   Yep yep. Loads of homework yet to do. I just thought I'd take a break.  Here's what's to be done:    Latin Translation   4 Algebra II Worksheets     I decided to just forget this, I'm not doing them. I don't care.      Much Ado About Nothing Essay Outline    Much Ado About Nothing Essay (Due Friday, so I should work on it some because if I don't I'll have LOADS of homework all week, because Mr. Murphey doesn't like me very well.)   College Report (Due Next Week, but see above as to my reason I should get some done...also...it's a big report...big grade...so I want it to be alright...you know?)    Read nonfiction exerpt on that thing on climbing Mt. Everest and two diagrams on two tragedies and their causes.     Read nonfiction article on beached whales and write, with detail, with facts from supporting text if the author made some people out to be villians and heros.     Yep yep. That's all.  As you can see (tis the theme o' the day!) I have done a little bit of my work. Go me! I rock! Whoohoo! I am on fire! I am TOTALLY slamming! I suck. I hate myself.  I might not do the translation and just take my zero 'cause I don't give a shit. Bad me bad me. Oh well. I don't care. Yeah, I do. But I don't.   Guess I should be going then...

      Lots of homework and work to do this weekend (mainly due to procrastination) but I'm not going to be home very much this weekend. So I don't know know. I have too much to do, too little time to do it. I guess I could do some of it in the car (8 hours+ this weekend). I'll probably do a lot of it tonight, though, I have to get up early tomorrow (Before 7).  I'm sure glad it's Friday. I'm really beat.  I need a rest.

      I love this song. I love this CD. I don't know why. I can't figure it out. It's totally different from what I normally listen to but I always find myself listening to it over and over. Especially this song. This is my favorite song on the whole CD. I've listening to it about 6 times in a straight row one evening. I like it a lot. I always repeat it at least once. Anyway...listen to it if you get a chance...I'm planning to put my review of the CD up on Amazon.com soon...    "Okay, I Believe You, But My Tommy Gun Don't"  by Brand New, from their album "Deja Entendu"  I am heaven sent. Don't you dare forget. I am all you've ever wanted, what all the other boys all promised. Sorry I told. I just wanted you to know. I think in decimals and dollars. I am the cause to all your problems. Shelter from cold. We are never alone. Coordinate brain and mouth, then ask me what it's like to have myself so figured out...Wish I knew. I hope this song starts a craze. The kind of song that ignites the airwaves. The kind of song that makes people glad to be where they are with whoever they're there with. This is war. Every line is about who I don't wanna write about anymore. I hope you come down with something they can't diagnose and don't have the cure for. Holding onto your grudge. Oh, it's so hard to have someone to love. And keeping quiet is hard. 'Cause you can't keep a secret if it never was a secret to start. At least pretend you didn't want to get caught. We're concentrating on falling apart. We were contenders, now we're throwing the fights. But I just want to believe, I just want to believe, I just want to believe...in us. Oh, we're so controversial. We are entirely smooth. We admit to the truth, we are the best at what we do. And these are the words you wish you wrote down. This is the way you wish your voice sounds - handsome and smart. Oh, my tongue's the only muscle of my body that works harder than my heart. And it's all from watching TV and from speeding up my breathing. Wouldn't stop if I could. Oh, it hurts to be this good. You're holding onto your grudge. Oh, it hurts to always have to be honest with the one that you love. So let it go. This is the grace only we can bestow.  This is the price you pay for loss of control. This is the break in the bend. This is the closest of calls. This is the reason you're alone. This is the rise and the fall.

      I'm a lot better after my rant on just about everything. I knew I would be.  I have this habit of letting things go and blowing off anger and not letting things get to me. I don't know why I do this, but I noticed nobody else does. Just for example, one of the reasons I was angry was something that happened between me and my sister. She's still mad as hell. I've forgotten about it. Why stay mad? I don't get it. Just don't get it.  When people have the choice of letting things go and being happy and staying angry and being upset, everyone choices the latter.  WHY?   Someone explain it to me, please.

      Ah school. 39 more school days to go. 7 Mondays.  8 Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.   But 7 Mondays.  Progress reports tomorrow then report cards a couple weeks later.  Then we will be in the last, very last 6 weeks. Then Summer. Summer break.  Oh summer break how far away you seem to be.  Tomorrow in English we'll be watching a movie so that's something to look forward to. I actually don't mind school too much. I mean it seems to me you can either be unhappy or make the best of it. And why do so many people chose to be unhappy? It's not that hard to be okay with things, it takes practice and something needs to click but eventually it's easy and you'll be like me. Apathetic and lazy and indifferent.  Ha. Well it's better than it sounds, really. Because I do know what's important and I do it. I just think it's easier to be laid back and let things be then to get worried and frustrated and upset and angry. I've noticed I'm the only one who seems to think this way.  But hey, if people like being worried and frustrated and upset and angry then whatever.

      Forget homework. I'll take my zero with pride.  Who assigns homework during Spring Break? I can understand a report or an essay or a project, but a latin translation? I mean, come on...  There is only one reason I am glad Spring Break is over and I can't admit it. So use your imagination.   Summer at my house. Taking a cool shower, but you never get dry because you just step out and sweat.  Oh summer how I hate thee. Well, you're alright, but I prefer fall and winter by far. Weather-wise. And holiday-wise. And I guess mostly everything-wise. But some aspects of summer are alright. Just not the humidity/heat/sunburns/etc/etc.

      Well here we are. The last, very last day of Spring Break. I sure don't know where the time went at all. 8 more weeks then summer though. That's something I guess. Right?  It's been a nice break. But it just seemed so short. I don't want to go back. I didn't think I'd want to stay in break  this  badly. But I do. I really don't want to have to go back to school.  I think I have some homework I need to do...

      I'm bored. But you know, I'm enjoying myself more than when I was actually doing something the other days of Spring Break. This is what Spring Break is supposed to be: bored and lazy.  I have only one big problem with that but I'm not going to say it outloud. Ha.

      And the stars at night are big and bright deep in your eyes Miss Vincent. You told me once I made you smile. We both know damn well I didn't.   I think the best Alkaline Trio songs were on the Hot Water Music split.  Am I right?  I like them best I think at least.    Today was pretty rad. Ha. Yeah. It was good.

      Well, Shelby  should  be  coming tomorrow. I say should because nothing is ever certain.  But I sure can't wait! I wonder what we'll do... I don't have any plans or anything at all.  We'll probably just be sitting around bored out of our minds the entire time.  Oh well. Ha. Hopefull we'll have a good time though. I really hope so. I'm kind of nervous. She hasn't been over here in  AGES  and I haven't seen her in SO long. I felt this way before seeing her the last time, at the Cheerleading Competion thing (I'm not a cheerleader, it was the only event that I could see her at). But I wasn't feeling as nervous this time until she said she was nervous. I didn't think she'd be nervous but now that she is I am way more nervous.

      I had the strangest dream last night. I remember it. I never remember my strange dreams. I usually just get that feeling, you know "I know I had a strange dream last night but I can't remember anything about it...just that it was weird."  I don't want to talk about this dream, it wasn't bad or terribly embarrassing but still. Oh, yeah, I guess it was  kinda  embarrassing, but could be alot worse. Ha.  Hey, the weirdest part of the dream was I was looking at my blog right 'cher and I had comments left everywhere.  Hint. Hint.

It's gone from good and keeps dropping down into lousy gradually.  Tomorrow I'm going to go to town with my mom (how country is that? "going into town") hopefully hopefully to get a CD tower.  I need at the very very LEAST one that'll hold 50 CDs. Hopefully I can find one...think I could find one at Radio Shack?

      3 short movie reviews.  1. Gothika Not bad. Worth watching. Everyone made it out to be way freakier than it really was. Well, my sister did at least. If she got scared by it I knew I would but I didn't. It was good though. I thought it was a good storyline, and good movie but not that scary. I guess I can see why some people would get scared - jumping and stuff, but I did get a few laughs. I won't spoil it or anything but if you've seen it you probably know what I'm talking about with a strangish twist thing that comes around the unwinding of the climax I guess. You know what I'm talking about? Well, after that part I already had everything figured out. Maybe it's predictable, maybe I'm just good. Ha.  2. The Wedding Singer I just rented this because of my fancy of Billy Idol. I really haven't seen too many Adam Sandler movies but I never liked any of them. Don't kill me. But it seems to me he plays the same role over and over and the same humor all the time. And I don't really like that kind of humor. He's kind of silly. Maybe that's what everyone likes. Who knows? Anyway, before the movie there was an ad for the soundtrack. Culture Club! The Police! Billy Idol (of course)! Loads of cool stuff...So I was getting pretty excited. Then I found out Drew Barrymore was in it (all I knew was Billy Idol. That's all I cared about) so I figured it couldn't be but SO bad because I thought she was pretty cool. I'm not going to worry about spoiling it because it's a predictable movie and you've probably seen it. So when the poor guy got dumped and was lying around in bed I thought my stereo turned on by itself but ah no, Boys Don't Cry was on the movie. Awesome. Then when was it? I know I heard 99 Red Balloons. Great. And then Adam played that song he wrote and he said "I was listening to the Cure alot" blah. Ha. Nice song. Really liked that song. I have to admit. I'd give anything to be able to hate that song. You know the song I'm talking about?  So anyway, about the movie and not the music. It was pretty good. Yeah, I said pretty good. Not my favorite movie but definitely not the worst movie I've ever seen. I must admit I'm impressed and I just might, if given the chance watch another Adam Sandler movie, but of course, I wouldn't have my hopes up. This is the 3rd Sandler movie I've seen in full and I hated the other ones. So hey. Then of course Billy Idol, my star of the movie. Heh. Ha. If it wasn't Spring Break I'd just fast forward to the end and watch the end over again, but seeing as it is Spring Break I'll probably just watch the movie over again. I'm not a big fan of watching movies over again when I've just watched them. I can't even do this with the best movies but it's Spring Break. What else is there to do?  3.  Reservoir Dogs Yeah, if you like AFI you probably appreciate this movie a lot. It's why I rented it at least. Finally got to rent it. I keep forgetting. I liked this movie. Yes I did. I am very glad I liked it, too. I don't like wasting my time watching bad movies, you see. No, I don't just like it because of it's affiliation with AFI's first album. It's a good movie. I don't watch many movie like this, but after this one part I thought "Woah! Nice." I wonder if, if you've seen it, you know what part I'm talking about. Anyway, the end was totally awesome. If you can get through all the blood and violence and  swearing  it is totally good. Nobody else in my family has any desire to watch it, though, no matter how much I rave about it. Hey. Whatever. They don't know what they are missing.  I wonder...if I just have a mind-set to like it on the sake of AFI. I don't think so. I mean I couldn't, could I? If I thought of that assumption, right? It's a good movie. Isn't it a good movie?  That is all.

      Off to get my braces. I'm too old for braces. I'm sort of kind of nervous.  In other news. At least someone got some use out of my words of wisdom. I don't know if she's listening to them but I guess she at least liked the way they sounded.  you shouldn't just be completely careless and everything but you really have to let things be and just live and take chances, you will get hurt, but if you never take any chance, how do you know that the thing you risk is worth more than you could ever imagine? Didn't cite me but I guess that's alright.

      Lookit me writing regularily. Me sick. I don't think I slept any last night. Maybe a little.  But I feel way tireder than anything. Feels like I haven't slept in ages. Algebra II gives me a funny feeling. It's a very bad feeling and I don't know why exactly I get it. Everyday I feel completely exhausted in it. I mean I try and not feel tired, try and pay attention, but no matter what we do, even if it's something half way interesting, something I acutally get, I still feel exhausted. So you can see why I felt so horrible today in Algebra II. It was the worst. I was this close )( to crawling out of my seat and lying on the floor.  I don't think I'm just tired because of my lack of sleep. When I did sleep I don't think I slept  well . And whatever I have makes me feel really burned-out.  I feel way better than I did in Algebra II though.  All I remember about last night is I kept finding myself coughing and hacking and my throat burning.  Then I finally was wide awake at about 6, 20 minutes before my alarm goes off.   It's not been the greatest of days but it's been okay. It went by FAST! Latin's never gone by so fast EVER. Programming went by fast too. Crazy. Heck, now that I think of it English did too. And even though Algebra II was unbearable, it did kind of go by faster than usual (shows how slow it usually goes by).  No school for me tomorrow. Just pain and torment. But no school. It's well worth it.

      I do so hate Sundays. Maybe more than Mondays. Yeah, I think I do hate Sundays more.  Sunday mornings are alright, except I still know the evening is coming. The evening is what I hate the most. I mean Mondays are okay because you're already there, you can't get out of it. But Sunday evening is just before it, so you have that anticipation for Monday.  Five more days until Spring Break. 20 Periods. And I get out all day Tuesday so that's only 16 for me.  It's sad I'd rather be going through torture at the orthadontist then at school. School isn't that bad.  I know first semester was a whole lot worse, so I don't let it get to me too much.  I'm thinking of doing this blog thing regularily. Since I haven't been. Nobody reads it though.  I guess that doesn't matter.  Nope. Doesn't matter at all.

        Happy Memorial Day   All of you who have been the military, are in the military or know anybody in that position, here's to you! *clinks glasses*  Even though we had today off the weekend didn't seem any bit longer. But that's alright because the summer is coming up and it'll be like one long weekend. Then another entire year of school to get through. Happy thoughts. Think happier thoughts.  I did all of my tons of homework yesterday so I would ensure today being a complete day off! I'm so glad. Today was okay though. Just okay. Four day week though, and this Friday I have my Algebra II SOL...gosh...I'm going to do so bad on that...that's okay, though...no it's not but yeah...  Next week is our last week. This is our second to last week of school. The year went by so fast!   I have a list of books I want to read and I got 5 of them at Barnes and Nobles yesterday. I want to save them for summer but it's so hard to refrain from reading them...I've already finished one of them...but I found a good alternative to this: Along with new books I've been wanting to read I've been wanting to read my favorite books over again. So I decided to read those until summer. Besides, we are reading Huck Finn in English class and super-speed and that keeps me busy.   I like to read.

        The Day After Tomorrow Review   Yay for reviews! I'm no good at writing them but I like to! I will hopefully put this on amazon.com when it comes out on video, but until then it will be here...I titled it:   It could have been so much better    [3 1/2 stars] I don't know where to start so I'll just dive right in. Some of the acting I didn't like. Sorry for being picky or whatever but it had this feel of an indie film that got big. The reports and news-anchormen and bystanders, I realize they aren't that important but still, you have to pay attention to the little things because they amount to a lot. I didn't like alot of the portrayl of people either. Alot of people's reactions to certain things I just couldn't get around. I just thought, "Nobody would react like that - that's so unrealistic."   Something happens (I don't want to spoil it) but it was a little twist/subplot - whatever you want to call it - it wasn't necessary. I mean, really, these people are in an ice age and you throw that in the movie - that's too much.   The little romantic subplot was alright, I normally hate romance in action/disaster films because but I have to admit that Donnie Darko (that's how I know him as...don't know his name)...I don't know...I like him...call me a sucker, whatever. But some of it was so silly - "You gotta tell her how you feel." Please. This isn't A Walk to Remember.  Now, don't get me wrong, it's a good movie and definetly worth seeing. I loved the idea behind it and alot of things that happened were great. I laughed at the parts that were funny because they were. Major props for that.   Somethings were a little predictable, I, myself, would have loved if it ended a different way but I wanted Lord of the Rings to end with Frodo keeping the ring and taking everything over so some may say I'm mad.  The thing that leaves me the most dissappointed was when it ended and the lights of the cinema came on and I looked around at all the people getting up, all the people going out to their SUVs, gas-guslers, to blow out their AC's at home, whatever. Just as the movies closed, impressing upon us all that this could really happen, our environment is in danger, we all should be doing something about it, I wonder just how many people care. I saw all the people going to see it - mostly teens, high schoolers just out to go see a movie, a place to make out, to goof off. I just wish more people would pay attention. I wonder if I'm too cynical, maybe these kids really are interested in global warming and the conservation of our natural resources. Maybe.

        Long post ahoy   I just got back home. At around 6 Shana, Sarah and I went into town and ate and then went to go see Shrek 2 at the cinema! It was so great! It was such a great movie, so funny. I love seeing movies too, doesn't matter what movie, really. Afterwards we went to Dairy Queen. 	At Dairy Queen it was packed! All these kids had the same shirts on and everything, they were some kids from Fuqua. Fuqua, this private school. This is the like the epitome of all that is stereotypically private school. These were the beautiful people that will go to Duke because daddy has "connections" they will be everyone's boss, they will be the boss of the kids they beat up in high school, the kids that qualify way more to be the boss. They will grow up sheltered, most spend their entire lives at Fuqua, or at least private schools in general. And it's a nice thought to think that after they graduate then they'll finally see things, and fall on their faces flat. But no, that won't happen. They will all go off to their private colleges, and be with the exact same type of people from high school. This will be their life. I pity them. 	I could be one of them. 	I used to go to Fuqua, you know. Through fourth grade. I remember when I went their it was my worst nightmare - to go to a public school. To me, that was the most horrible, scariest thing that could ever happen to me. Then came the day I found out I actually would be switching. This was crazy, I couldn't handle it. I don't have a good memory at all, but that is one of the few memories that stick vivid in my mind - finding I was switching from a private to public school. Black kids? I would be going to school with black kids? Aren't they all like dirty, bad people? And gangs...and fighting...isn't that all at public schools? What was going to become of me? 	It's one thing that really makes up what I am - looking back, making that transition. Now I would rather slit my throat and let the blood drip into a cup then drink it back down then go back to a private school, namely Fuqua. I'd rather gouge out my own eyes than to never have left Fuqua. I realize this is weird to say because I would never know any different, but I'm just saying I'm so, so glad I left.  	And seeing all these kids made me wonder how I would have turned out. I couldn't be the same, could I? I think this is the eternal question that everyone asks...especially with the cloning issue. Are our personalities predestined? I mean, naturally environment plays a big role, because one kid who grew up in the White House is obviously going to be different then if they grew up in an alley. Right? Or, wouldn't they still at least have some similarities? At a first thought you immediatly think, "Of course they'd be different!" But I think hard about it and I'm not sure at all. If the White House kid is self-righteous and self-absorbed and uncaring about other people, you'd think someone living on the streets wouldn't be like that. But couldn't they? They may have it alot harder, and are probably way stronger, but they could still be like that, couldn't they? 	So I'm so confused, what the hell would I be like?? Would I, today be sitting here typing on my computer, listening to Interpol with my AFI poster next to me and my TryVeg.Com ad on my door?  	Then, I look ahead of me and see my photograph of me, Shelby and Amanda together. That stops me. Never met them...I would never have me them...what would have become of me? Who would I have been friends with? Because, I don't think I would fit in with any of those people at Fuqua, I think I would eventually have drawn away from them and been an outcast throughout middle and high school. But I was thinking...when I was younger that would bother me alot...wanting people to like me...and doing things just because I wanted them to like me and I thought it would make them...but eventually I broke away from that...gradually though...and now I still have an occasionally weakening but that's it. Was that because of switching schools and growing up somewhere else?? Or would I have grown up to always be like that if I stayed? I'm thinking maybe yes, because it was so sheltered.  	I remember the second day at the public school I saw this little girl in a wheelchair who was acting so strangely and I went home and just bawled. What was wrong with this poor little girl? I was so scared. I had never been exposed to anything except white, capable, rich kids. And here, kids were specially educated, they had reduced lunches.  	At Dairy Queen I recognized a couple kids. One was my best friend. My best friend. I know it was her even though she looked so different. She was my best friend of course I recognized her. I haven't seen her since 6th grade. I didn't say anything to her, though. I didn't know if I really wanted to or not, and I still don't. I'm sorry for stereotyping people, but she looked like even if I did say something to her and she did recognize me she wouldn't have even wanted to acknowledge my existance. I mean you've seen the movies - this is the girl the dorky guy wants and then in the end just when she finally falls for him he finds out he really does love the losery girl that's always loved him. I remember she always was the most popular girl in my grade, and was well known in several other grades. This girl had a "boyfriend" in 3rd grade, she made good grades, all the teachers loved her - you know, that type. I really never did figure out how she was my friend, and she really did like me, didn't she? She did, she really did. Huh. Imagine that. So maybe she wouldn't have seen me as lowly...but she could have...I would have liked to know...but maybe I don't.     Music: Leif Erikson - Interpol

        "I'm so sorry"   They said Morrissey might be on sometime during the week (because he didn't get to appear Monday on account of being sick) so I taped the Late Late Show W/ Craig Kilborn again last night (this morning, technically) and he wasn't on again...he's still sick. But Craig did say he might still be on sometime this week - not to perform but at least to talk. Which is awesome, I really hope he does. But they interviewed some Morrissey fans...you know...for jokes...like asking them to name as many anti-depressents as they could and all that jazz. Har har.  Tomorrow is Friday! I well-waited for Friday! The week went by at a perfect pace! Not too slow - but not too quick either. Now that we are here at the end of the year, I don't the year to end. I don't know why. I know I'm weird but I just am content where I am and then summer is going to come and then summer will be over and we'll have an  entire  year to get through again until the next summer. I don't know why I always do that...even if something good is about to happen...it doesn't matter because then things will go right back to how they were...

        Just 12 days...?   I think I must have sophmore-itis. Or end-of-school-itis or something.  I don't want to do anything. I feel so restless in class...It's awful. I notice the fewer and fewer days of school we have the less and less homework I do and less and less energy I put into school work (causing my grades to decrease too unfortunetly...).  Is this an example of direct variation, inverse variation, or joint variation? Too bad I have no idea. Too bad my Algebra II SOL is in 7 days.  I'll probably cram the day before, read over all my notes. At least I have notes, I'm about the only person in the class that takes notes...and still I'm struggling. It's not fair. (I noticed that sounds immature, and I was going to say "ha." afterwards but it sounded dumb.) I've never had this much trouble in a class before. I mean World History was hard...but just because of the tests...I understood the stuff..nothing in Algebra clicks for me... I miss geometry. I liked geometry.

        Most horrible news...   I heard that Morrissey's appearence on The Late Late Show With Craig Kilborn has been postponed or possibly even  canceled  because of sickness. NOO. No. That's so horrible. I've been looking foward to it.  But the cbs website still shows him as a guest on the show tonight and the rest of the week...like planned...so... I don't know. I sure hope he's still on for it!  I'm programming it anyway. If you'd like to see it, it's on CBS at 12:30AM! I'm not staying up for it by any means, ha, but I'm taping it.   Let's see...today was alright. Yeah, it was okay. Monday-ish. One more Monday left! Because we have memorial day off, so only 1! 13 more school days! I think 17 (including weekends) till summer break.  I've never been so not-excited for summer break before. I'm just complacent where I am now. I've just been getting comfortable in this school (yeah, after two years - I adjust slowly to anything, but I eventually do) and I'm happy with the routine of getting up, going to school, coming home, watch the simpsons, eat dinner, take a shower, do my homework, then go to bed. I love order and routine and I've got it. I wake up every morning at 6 something on weekends and on weekdays without my alarm. And I'm not tired. I feel good now.  When summer gets here I'm going to have nothing to do ever. And I'm half way through high school now. That's so scary. Those two years went by fast...I'm scared to graduate even though I'm also so excited. I hear senior year goes by super fast, so really...it's really close... But I still have 3 weeks...I'll try and enjoy them the best I can. I used to hate school so much, but now it's not so bad. I think it's not so bad. And everybody hates school, but why? I mean, I used to but I can't tell you exactly why I hated it, other than the work and stupid stuff but...that's life...school is school...I don't know exactly how to put my feeling into words but...I guess I just accept it...I think I've always accepted things more and quicker than other people.

      Right now we've got a reason to live, but it's got nothing to do with you. We've got a lot of places that we're gonna go, a lot of things that we're gonna do. In your world  we may be no one , but  what makes you think you're someone?  We have got just what we need and we don't need you. No one. I can tell where our future lies, and you can tell we've got  nothing to hide . The way things seem to me right now -  everything will be just fine . We're gonna do it all our way. We don't need you to darken our day. We've  never given up before  and this stand won't be our first time.  No one's gonna tell me, I'm gonna do it my way. No one's gonna tell me how to get it done.     Music: Don't Make Me Ill - AFI

        Oh summer summer summer   I don't like alot about summer but some things are pretty cool. I've been feeling pretty optimistic lately. Well, not just lately, for a while now. I think it's growing up and maturing, clarifying my own thoughts and philosophies and all that jazz. It's pretty cool. I mean, I'm a fan of happiness.   Well summer, to me is cool air condition, mixes, sleeping, laziness, nice cool early morning weather, late night thunder and lightning storms, no school, movies, books, swimming, sunburns - but aloe, mowing the lawn, being outdoors. Lots of stuff.  I love mixes though. I love making them. Especially for other people. But I don't know anybody to give one to. Until my friend Lauren came along and I made one for her! That was the greatest week of my life. I spent the entire week planning the perfect songs for the mix, then the perfect order the songs would go in. I tested them and made sure they sounded okay together. Taking painstaking measures for little things - like making sure Joy Division and Interpol weren't together, but put AFI and Tiger Army's True Romance next to each other to see if the listener could pick up on Davey Havok's vocals continuing to the Tiger Army song in the background.  I was unsatisfied with the Blondie song, though. I put it right after Minor Threat and I think that sounded weird.  Anyway, I was spending the morning making an AFI mix. So far it's just on my computer, I haven't burned it yet. I was putting the songs in order. But I have just been listening to them on shuffle and it's so great. This is the first real AFI mix I've ever made and it's so great! I go from Cruise Control to The Leaving Song to Death of Seasons.   That reminds me, I, as a big long time AFI fan, am worried about the next approach AFI will take in their music. I admit, I'm not the biggest fan of Sing the Sorrow. I like the older stuff a lot better. I like how Davey's voice is more undeveloped and it's underproduced. That's my favorite type of music, most of my favorite bands are the old ones, with weird recordings - The Misfits, Minor Threat, The Damned.  So I was listening to Death of Seasons today, because I added that on my mix, and I hope they go in a direction to that rather than more like Girl's Not Grey or Silver and Cold. Now, don't get me wrong, they are beautiful, really intelligent songs. You can tell the artist is very talented when you hear it. And that's great and all, if that's what you like. And I do like it, really, it's one of my favorite types of music, it's just not the top favorite. You know? I'd rather hear Very Proud of Ya than Sing the Sorrow. But the thing with AFI, is they are so unpredictable. I'm so anxious to hear their new album. But I know we still have a long long while to go yet.  That's one of the things that made me like AFI so much, and why I have been a fan for so long, it's that they change and evolve. I love that. Someone who hears Answer That and Stay Fashionable after hearing Silver and Cold on MTV every morning...it's like two different bands. That's so great! All the other bands, all their albums have that constant trademark sound or whatever. Linkin Park's new album's songs sound exactly like their first ones. Where's the good in that? It's boring.  I didn't mean for this post to get all long like this about talking about AFI and all that. I was just going to post my AFI mix-playlist. It's so hard deciding on what songs to use! I want to play them all from every CD! He he. Well so I finally got 27 songs, that make up about an hour of music. 27 songs! In an hour! Do you believe it? I can fit 20 more minutes on a CD! I didn't think of that. I might add more songs.  While I was at all this music burning and mixing and playlisting madness, (which I don't usually do, because songs take up a lot of space on one's computer, you know) I downloaded Winamp. I'm so excited. I used to use it all the time but when I got this new computer I never downloaded it because this computer already came with Windows Media Player and Musicmatch and all these media players, it was crazy. So I figured I might as well just use them. Windows Media Player is great, I like how it has info on the band and the album you are listening to and all that.  But I used to love Winamp so much because of it's simplicity and I liked all the different skins you could have.  So I downloaded it today and I have this continued feeling of nostalgia. It's so great. I remember how to work everything. Ha ha. I think the feeling also comes from listening to all this AFI. I haven't listened to them this much in a long long time. It also comes from summer I think. And the end of another school year.  I got off topic again.  Check out this skin I found:  urlLink Click here!!! New window will open  It's SOOO awesome! I like it alot! I tryed downloading this one with Robert Smith but I couldn't figure out how to work it right. Ha. Me stoopid. O____O It was an awesome one though, and I already have a totally awesome wallpaper with Robert Smith on it and it would have matched perfectly! They are both dark and dreary (It's the Cure so yeah ha ha) and in black and white. I got it off of I think www.curiosity.de (I'm all about giving credit where credit is deserved). I'm pretty almost positive. I got it a long time ago.  This is my mix, in no order: 1. A.F.I. - He Who Laughs Last... (1:50) 2. A.F.I. - Keeping Out of Direct Sunlight (0:58) 3. A.F.I. - Half-Empty Bottle (1:39) 4. A.F.I. - Three Reasons (1:33) 5. A.F.I. - A Single Second (2:12) 6. A.F.I. - The Boy Who Destroyed the World (3:05) 7. A.F.I. - Totalimmortal (2:44) 8. A.F.I. - Brownie Bottom Sundae (1:46) 9. A.F.I. - Sacrifice Theory (1:58) 10. A.F.I. - Girl's Not Grey (3:10) 11. A.F.I. - Of Greetings and Goodbyes (3:04) 12. A.F.I. - Cereal Wars (1:16) 13. A.F.I. - Death of Seasons (3:59) 14. A.F.I. - Smile (1:31) 15. A.F.I. - Coin Return (2:33) 16. A.F.I. - This Secret Ninja (2:20) 17. A.F.I. - The New Patron Saints and Angels (2:17) 18. A.F.I. - The Last Kiss (3:02) 19. A.F.I. - Your Name Here (2:27) 20. A.F.I. - Today's Lesson (2:14) 21. A.F.I. - Crop Tub (1:50) 22. A.F.I. - Don't Make Me Ill (2:40) 23. A.F.I. - Consult My Lover (1:35) 24. A.F.I. - Open Your Eyes (1:16) 25. A.F.I. - Cruise Control (1:11) 26. A.F.I. - The Leaving Song (2:44)  I realized only when I was halfway through typing them I didn't really need to keep putting "A.F.I." since I already established the fact that they were all AFI but whatever. As I said, I'm stoopid. So those are more or less my favorite AFI songs from each album. I said more or less. Because it changes of course and others I like but aren't quite as listenable for mixes, if you know what I mean. @______@  Oh oh, also, I said 27 songs, because I did have this one but I took it off.   That is all. Have a nice night whoever sees this!    Music: Sacrifice Theory - AFI

      Statesmen Day is this day at my school. Actually, it's half a day. We go to classes in the morning then there are a bunch of activities like three-legged races and egg tosses and stuff like that outdoors for the rest of the day. You know, just like a fun day where everyone can hang out. These type of days are not for me.  The only event I thought might be worth watching was the pie-eating contest. Haha. That's so great. Well, anyway, I actually got out of going and my whole family thinks I'm crazy. Really, crazy wasn't the word anybody used, but " weird " and " mental " were. I italicized them because they were emphasized when in use. "You are so  MENTAL !" and so forth and so on.  Well anyway, my dad's a teacher and he was there and I asked him about the pie-eating contest and he said (the elipse thing(...) denotes I don't remember what he said exactly.),  "...kids throwing up everywhere."  Hahahaha. That actually might have been worth a miserable afternoon. I would have stayed to see that.  But they already think I'm crazy, and I can see why. But anway, Thursday I was not going to go, but I could tell my dad was all dissappointed because I'm not a social butterfly or pretty or athletic or popular. You know, parents like that. But no, I'm a huge loser and let down for my dad and he knows I'm all introverted and shy like I am and everything and I could tell he was just thinking, "I should have known she would skip out on S. Day." Or something to that effect.  So I was like, "I'm GOING." Because you know...it's not that fun being a dissapointment." And so my dad was like, "What??" And it's hard to explain, but I guess he knew I didn't want to go and didn't know why I was saying I was going to go.  And so my parents were watching TV in the TV room (whaddya know) and were like, "You don't have to go!" I was like, " I'm going! " And went up the stairs and they laughed. Both of them. I don't know why.  So I said, "IT'S NOT FUNNY! I DON'T WANT TO GO!" Not all that loud or anything, I shouldn't have used all-caps. But anyway, eventually I could tell my dad thought I was in complete sufferage and mental-anguish or something over going so I eventually agreed to go. He thinks I didn't want to go because I didn't want to miss school.   But then later, when I was in the kitchen with my folks, and I was asking my dad about S. Day and the pie eating contest and all that jazz, I said I was just going to go because of him.  This leads to stupid stuff from my mom about me always doing stuff I don't want to do for my dad and I won't do a single thing for her. Blah blah. That's another story.

        Lousy Life Continues   I don't know how to get home tomorrow. That means staying for  stupid  Statesmen Day.  No...No...NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  If you've seen Evil Dead II, just think of the part when Ash realizes the bridge is down - that's the NO there. Haha that's like the best part of the entire movie. Except when he trapped his hand and weighed it down with books, the top one being "A Farewell to Arms" Hahahahahaha. That's the best part. That's so clever. I love that. Anyway. About Statesmen Day. My sister is driving me to school tomorrow and I think she's staying. So I don't have a ride home. I'm going to cry. I don't want to stay. Social-anythings makes me unbearably uneasy. I have to BEG my sister to take me home.  I still don't understand the day 'counting' for absenses or whatever. That's stupid. Please please please. I don't want to go to Statesmen Day.   I've been thinking about this one thing that's big in my life. Something I can't quite figure out. I don't like talking about it though. But...it's something I do and it's not good...but it's also not exactly bad...as I've been thinking. It's not all that wrong...And I'm trying to change it and stop it but...I am happy with the way it is now, so why should I bother stopping? I mean, I know I'd be happier when I stop and fix this problem, but...I'm not hurting anybody by what I'm doing now, and I'm not completely unhappy now...so...I don't know. I'll have to think about it more I guess.     Music: Agenda Suicide - The Faint

        What a lousy  day  life it's been   Tomorrow is Stupid Statesmen Day.  I think I'm actually going to have to stay for the whole thing. I was just going to go to classes in the morning then skip the whole activities and quote, unquote "fun" that's planned for the rest of the day.  Socializing? Playing games? Hanging out with friends? That's so not me. Sorry. That just has no appeal to me. If I had a friend or something then yeah, I can see how it would be totally awesome to have the whole afternoon to hang with them but seeing as I don't I won't.  That's too bad.  I just know I wouldn't have a good time. I know it would/will be horrible. But anyway, I think I might have to go. I hear the day "counts". Counts for what? I mean in relation to absenses and stuff..that's so stupid. I'm thinking about report cards and stuff where it shows the number of times you've missed whatever class. They can't add a day because I was in the class that morning, see? I don't see how they can count it.  We shall see.

        In honor of Mr. Curtis   My favorite Joy Division song.   So this is permanence, love's shattered pride What once was innocence, turned on its side Grey cloud hangs over me, marks every move Deep in the memory of what once was love  Oh, how I realized how I wanted time  Put into perspective, tried so hard to find Just for one moment I thought I'd found my way Destiny unfolded - I watched it slip away  Excessive flashpoints, beyond all reach Solitary demands for all I'd like to keep Let's take a ride out, see what we can find A valueless collection of hopes and past desires  I never realized the lengths I'd have to go All the darkest corners of a sense I didn't know Just for one moment I heard somebody call Looked beyond the day in hand - there's nothing there at all  Now that I've realized how it's all gone wrong Got to find some therapy, this treatment takes too long Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway Got to find my destiny before it gets too late  -"Twenty Four Hours"

      Have you ever had one of those days where it wasn't exactly bad but you couldn't call it good either? Like it was almost lousy but not quite.  But I still have plenty of day left for it to go either way. Down or Up. Bad or Good.  I'm hoping for good but I doubt it. I've already done something I know I'll be regretting and hating myself over later. I don't know why exactly I always do that. I don't think I'll ever figure that out.  I need a job. I need money. My family doesn't make much money and I hate buying things because I feel horrible and like I shouldn't because I should be helping to save up money. And I just bought a shirt off the internet today that I've been saving up for. It was 19.95 but then 8 bucks for tax and 90 cents for the money order's tax so that's almost 30 bucks. Anyway, there is so much I'd like to buy.   Some bands I really wish I had some album or anything by them. Bands that I like so much that I really ought to own at least an EP or something by them but I don't. I don't have any money for it.   I have Morrissey's Bona Drag on a cassette because it was 3 bucks and that's all I have of that. I really want to get anything by Morrissey on CD. I like that cassette alot but they are such a hassle for me to listen to because I don't have a stereo, just my computer to play music.    P.S. Don't forget Ian Curtis today.

        Stupid piece of shit   I liked that title for my blog but I thought it might turn some people off or something. Not that I care or anything (I do).   I think it was early to get yearbooks. If I remember right, last year we didn't get them until the last week of school. I thought that was a standard time to get yearbooks.  My picture is actually kind of alright. I think it is at least and I never like any pictures I take at all. I need to ask somebody. I don't know anybody to ask. But I think it really reflects me...like I only have this small sweet shy smile (aliteration unintentional). I look a little nervous like I'm scared something will happen to make things fall downhill or make me sad or upset. My camp councelor said I'm always "waiting for the other shoe to fall" and that's so accurate.  But anyway, my picture shows that I think. I don't like my hair in it but I never like my hair ever so that's no big deal. My AFI shirt is striking. Ha.  It's an alright picture I guess. I've got nothing to work with though so a picture of me can only be but so alright.    I've got nothing to do. I wish Sarah was awake. Or anybody, really. Nobody is around. My dad is outside working and I asked if he'd go bowling with me (not expecting anything - half kidding) and he said he would like to - he was thinking about it earlier - but he has a lot of work to do before it rains. I said I'd help him so he could get it done quicker but he said I couldn't help. He has to mow really tall grass and you have to do it this special way or something and he knows what he's doing and I don't so he'll do it. I don't blame him for not letting me. I always do things myself because I don't trust anybody else to do it right.  But I am sad that he would go bowling if he could. I don't know if Sarah's awake or not. Somebody ate eggs and it wasn't me and it wasn't my dad...it couldn't have been my mom...and my aunt's visiting and I don't think it was her...so it had to have been Sarah... But I didn't hear anything from her room so she could have gone back to bed. Yesterday she said she wanted to go bowling I wonder if she would today. I have some money, even though I was saving it for a band tee.   At least this is giving me something to do. As long as I keep typing I'm not bored. I even worked on my stupid site. I even played a little guitar. I even typed some. I've done everything. I did my homework early, that's the big one. I don't even believe that.  But I don't want the day to end or anything because I like weekends. But then I don't. And we only have four more weeks of school anyway, so soon I'll be doing this everyday anyway. And I know exactly how summer break is going to be. That problem I have...if you are reading this and are curious...just read some previous posts...I'm having trouble enough dealing with it now...with school to keep me busy, let alone during the summer when I have nothing to do but that. That's why I want a summer job. I applied for one but I don't think I'll get it. I know I won't.   I don't have friends. Nobody to do anything with. My sister doesn't like me and is mean. I don't do anything on the computer except use it to play music and play solitaire. I can only read but so long, depending on the book. Horray for summer.

        R Rated Films?    You can't get into a "R" rated film if you are like under 18 or something, right? Isn't that right? I don't know. I can remember ever going to a "R" rated films without an adult before...I could be wrong though...do you think they'd check or something?   I want to go see Troy...There's no harm in trying though, right? Except...waste of gas...and gas prices are like $$$$$$ sky rocketing $$$$$.   Though I could go with Sarah and if not we could take our money and bowl a game or two or something. That'd be fun. Maybe I could get in touch with Shelby or someone and they could meet up with us and go bowling too. I want to go bowling.

        I hope you're having a nice day...   Everybody I know is having such a lousy day/week. Everywhere I look everyone is just dragging. Summer is coming up, y'all. Tomorrow is Friday. Cheer up! Just keep in there, you guys! That goes out to all of you, anybody reading this (nobody) if you're feeling down it'll be okay. It'll always be okay in the end. It may have been better but it could have been worse - either way there was no way of knowing so be happy with what you have and just move on. I've noticed that alot. And something today really helped me clarify the idea and think about it more. Well, not that in particular, but happiness in general. It's not caring what other people think. I used to be so uptight and I still am, really, even if I don't want to be. It's just the way I am, I can't think too quickly in social situations and I clam up but then right afterwards I know exactly what I should have done and it would have been okay. I'm working on it. But anyway, the more relaxed I get about how other people see me or think about me the better I feel. It's so radical...you probably think I sound so cheezy or whatever...but it really does feel like a weight lifts off you when you just stop being so concerned with what everyone thinks of you.  Where does it get you anyway?  I don't know why I used to worry so much, I just can't find any reason and maybe now that I'm older I can see, finally, how pointless all that was. But, like I said, I still get caught off guard all the time. Old habits die hard or whatever. The thing that happened today...I used to think these certain people...I thought I wanted to be like just like them or at least just be a part of that crowd, or be seen like them. I don't. I don't know why I did. Well, I know why, but still that was so stupid and worthless. At least I didn't ever pine away at the thought of it or try so hard to be like them or whatever. I know some people do that and I feel sorry for them. I'm glad especially, though, that I can see right through them. They were talking about stuff like they were so into it and so up on it or whatever and I just wanted to tell them exactly what I thought...but they probably would have hated me for it.  One of the things they were talking about...they just follow trends...but they say they don't or whatever...you know those people...? Like, "Don't dare label me!!" But it's okay for me to call you a prep or jock or whatever and stereotype and judge you. That's just fine.  I never get a chance to be around these people at all, this is one of the first times. So this doesn't really have much point at all, it's not like they were including me or anything or trying to get to know me. I am nobody to them. I just happened to be sitting next to them during the placement test.  I'm still on the outside. Still the outsider and loner and loser.  I am so fine with it.  And if you think I'm something else, I'm fine with that too.  If you want to think I'm poser for wearing something then that's fine. You're opinion of me doesn't make a difference in that respect because that opinion is nothing to me. You've never even talked to me? You have nothing to go on. How stupid is that? I wear what I LIKE. That's a lot better reason than what some people give like "It's cool." or "It's punk." or "It's gangsta." or even those who wear things just because everyone else wears them and they want to wear what everybody else wears. That's fine - that's cool that you do what you do. I'm fine with you doing it and I think it would be nice if you could be okay with what I do but that's okay if you don't. Because I don't care. I'll always be the pathetic quiet girl that gets strange looks and that suits me just fine because I'm being me and that's all anybody can do. And that's all anybody can do to live their live to the fullest. You know that expression - "live your life to the fullest." So many people sit around and moan about how pointless life is or whatever. Instead of being so depressed about it - why not just try and make it worthwhile? That seems so much more logical to me, don't you think?    Music: Love Buzz - Nirvana

        You know what I like?   I like to go down the roads and see people mowing their lawns or trimming their trees or weed-wacking.  Working in gardens, sitting on their porches in the evening, walking around their lawns, getting their mail, working on a car. I love to see it all.  And I can go outside at this time and still here someone's weed-wacker going.  That's what I like about summer. That's when you see it all. You go down the roads in winter and don't see a soul outside. In fall you occasionally see someone raking or burning leaves but that's just about it. Spring and summer people are outside - gardening, yardworking, enjoying the air, enjoying family or friends. It's great.    Music: All Hell Breaks Loose - The Misfits

        Why...   I just don't understand why this always happens.  I don't know.  I know it's my fault. It's nobodys fault but my own, I  know  that. But I just can never seem to do anything about it. I just never do anything about it no matter how badly I want to. Isn't that so stupid? If I want to so badly, you'd think it'd be easy to stop this...but I don't and can't.  I don't know why I can't.  It has to be something about me. I must be stupid. Or weak or whatever. I don't know.  I try so, so hard but it never seems to last.    Music: Steamer Trunk - Alkaline Trio

        The week's alright...   This week is going by fast. I know I probably just jinxed it and the next two days will drone un unbelievably slow but hey.  That placement test is tomorrow. I'm a little nervous...I can't believe how many people are taking it...all those people can't get in, can they? I don't think so. I hope not. Even if that means I won't be making the cut...all those people shouldn't be able to take duel enrollment...    Music: Mr. Chainsaw - Alkaline Trio

        I miss my Imood...   I don't know if I'm supposed to feel sad, mad, happy, hateful, depressed, disgusted, or what.  Right now I'm kind of in limbo. If I dwell on this one thing - its a good thing. But then there's something else and it's a bad thing.  I guess it sounds simple - dwell on the happy thing - the good thing. There should be no question about it. So why do I question?  I don't know why I can't be happy or let myself be happy. Maybe...I don't think it's a good idea to block everything out just because it's hard to face. Because eventually you'll have to face it anyway and if you ignore it it can just get worse and worse and you won't realize it until it's too late and it's so inflamed you can never get over it.  I guess.  I think I did okay on that test on Caesar's Commentaries...I'm a little worried about the sight translation but I think I did okay. I'm surprised I got an 80 on that Algebra II quiz...I know I should be happy but still...I had high hopes for that quiz.  I have to cancel my orthadontist appointment tomorrow. I found out I've missed 3 2nd and 3rd period classes. Two class I can exempt exams in and I am definetly going to exempt any exam I can.  (You can miss up to 3 days and have an A in the class and it has to be a non-SOL class to exempt.)

Fucking store never has the monsters and they never get more. Post, Kellogs, General Mills? It's the cereal war.  I hope sexual chocolate is in stock, it's got a condem in the box. I'll try some cocoa puffs today who the fuck is Sonny anyway? Some say Dino's are the best,  they've got more marshmallows than the rest.  There's not a lot of cocoa in Cocoa Krispies, and always stay away from Wheaties.  Now it's dinner time and I'm going back to the store. I had some Erkles, liked 'em alot. It's the cereal war. I  wish I were Calvin or Hobbes  and then I could try  Sugar Bombs .  The soggies will never get Cap'n Crunch,  I guess I'll have Crunch Berries for lunch.

        Shoo...   I'm beat. I'm sore. My hands hurt. I cut the entire yard with the push mower. I'm just tired. Working hard in extreme heat always makes me exhausted. But mostly my hands hurt and are all blistered up.  You should see my shoes. They are so green. I feel good though. It always feels good to get something accomplished.  I should have used sunscreen though. Stupid stupid. I don't know what I was thinking.  I feel like taking a cold bath or something but I hate baths.  Too bad I have homework. I know I'll just be more tired this evening and I know I won't feel like doing my homework at all. Next weekend I'm doing my homework Friday night and then I won't have to worry about it at all.  Even though I feel good about my mowing, something happened today that wasn't good and I feel really lousy. Really lousy. Awful, really.  Oh well.

        "I'm tired...so tired, so tired."   I couldn't sleep last night and I woke up at 6:20. 6:20.  I forgot to turn my alarm off so it went off at 7. 7. I woke up before I do on WEEKDAYS. Geez. Actually I'm not that tired which is the thing. I woke up wide awake and I'm still that way. I feel rested which is weird. I slept well I think.

      I feel like I'm walking the tightwire. I set my Imood as "fragile" because I can't think of any other way to describe it. I feel like my entire state of mind can change by the drop of a pin. I feel like I'm scared something will make me feel low - something bad will happen that'll make me go back in the depressed/irritated mood I've been in for the past few days. But I'm not happy either and I can't see anything happening that would make me happy, just impossible things, or little things that won't make much difference when I've sunk so far down recently.  Now I'm feeling lousy, I think I crossed back into the depressed state I had been in for so long now.  Happy thoughts. I have to think happy thoughts.  Uhm. I don't have a clue. Nothing has really been making me feel good. Nothing feels right.  I don't know. What makes me happy?  Music...I'm listening to music...it's not really helping...it's kind of depressing angry music though...ha...I don't guess that helps...I don't really have much happy music though...I'm not really into that. I have this Christmas mix I made...Christmas is supposed to be happy but it's punk and emo and ska songs...about bad Christmases and stuff. That made me feel better. Ha ha.

        "We've got a problem"   I think last night was the first time I was fully aware that I had this problem and I've been thinking about it more and then I stopped thinking about it and did that thing I do where I cut everything out to do the problematic thing and then I came back to thinking about it and felt so shameful that I did it again. I really hate myself when I do it. And I always do it.  I actually said something to my family that I think I had a problem. I think they think I'm kidding. I mean, come on. I actually tryed to talk about a problem I had to my FAMILY. This is not something I do often and they practically blow me off.   Whatever.  I came up with a plan last night but I broke it this afternoon. I'm so stupid. I hate this.   Though it's not that big of a deal I guess but I hate it so much that it is a big deal to ME. It's not healthy either... I was looking something up about similar problems on the internet and it was saying it is a problem and everything and that anybody who said "yes" to three or more of a series of questions should get help (therapists and stuff) and I answered yes to way more than just three.  So anyways, I don't want to go to a therapist or anything because I know exactly what they are going to try to get me to do and I don't want that at all so I know I need to help myself. I have my plan I just have to stick with it which is the hardest part.  I need something...that'll help me stick with it...I can't think of anything though. I'll have to really come up with some sort of help.    In other news. I'm so out of this fight. I'm getting out. I have to get out. "Into the darkness is where you're dragging me and into the dark is where I never want to be."  That came to me just now and it's how I feel.  I've never really been in this situation before and it's an awkward one and I want to badly to get out and not be in it but there's that one thing that keeps pulling me in, making me stay. I hope it blows over because I hate it.   Something else I'm avoiding too... I'm doing a pretty good job of it too *knocks on wood*.

        Titles titles   I'm bored so I thought I'd just come to blogger to put something on my blog. Unfortunetly, I have nothing at all to say.  I'm just procrastinating.  I hate homework. School tomorrow. Nothing to look foward to this week.  6  more weeks of school exactly. That's 30 days! Wow! 30! I'm not looking foward to summer really. Not like I usually am. I would if I had a job. But I have a problem that I don't like to admit and that's why I don't want it to be summer. It's a bad problem and I'm ashamed of it and I hate it but I know it has to be a semi-serious problem if I try so hard to help it and stop but I do it anyway no matter what. I tell myself things to make it seem okay but then after a little bit I realize I shouldn't have done that and I'm so mad at myself for saying those things to myself.  During the school week I don't have time to do this really but on weekends and breaks I do so that's why I don't like them and why I would rather be at school.  I'd rather be at school than do this. It must be a problem. I don't want help. But maybe I need it. I've gotta help myself.

If you are reading this and you have seen Donnie Darko, and have any idea at all what the movie is about or what exactly happened or whatever. If you watched it and weren't confused the entire time, please can you leave me a comment because I'm stupid...and confused... Or if you have seen it and are confused to...leave me a comment so I'll know I'm not alone and we can be confused together...

        There was nothing to drink 'cept some old rotten milk someone left in the sink   Well Chronicles of Riddik. However it's spelled. My sister asked if I wanted to go with her to see it today and I didn't want to but eventually got convinced into going. I bought our tickets walked into the door on the left. A warm room that smelled like pee. Warm pee inevidentably followed my thoughts since it was warm as well. I checked my seat to make sure nothing was in it (puke, blood, etc.) like always (can't be too careful) then sat and waited for the movie to start. We got there early so I did my favorite pastime of embarassing my sister in public. That was fun but then the movie started.  I would have walked out if I had gone by myself and I wasn't tight on cash and didn't want to waste 4 bucks.  What a lousy movie. I was thinking to myself the whole time, "Nobody can actually  like  this." But oh no, my sister thoroughly enjoyed it. Really loved it. So if my not liking it offends you or anything, I apologize but I didn't like it.  I hated the writing. Eventually after the first eon I got used to the dialog but it really striked me as awful when I first heard it. It just didn't seem to fit the movie to me. But what do I know?  It also might have been decent if Vin Deisil (however that's spelled too) wasn't Vin Deisil. If the character was supposed to be completely pompous, arragant and self-serving then he did a good job though.  The lighting of the movie gave me and my sister a headache, she admited. It didn't really give me headache but it got on my nerves.  All and all I think the movie had a lot of potential and if I'm not mistaken it was a book before it became a movie. I wonder what the book is like. Maybe I should really check it out before bashing it so much, maybe it was supposed to be like that and I just didn't get it or something. Who knows. I did like the one dude. Vaako I think it was. He was pretty nifty. I loved that guy's hair. He reminded me of somebody who had the potential of being a psychobilly frontman. I looked him up on imdb.com when I got home and saw that he played Eomer in LoTR. I recongized him after that but had no clue before then. I think that's all I have to say.  Oh no wait. I didn't understand a thing that was going on. I was completely lost. But I think I got the jist of it. Some bad people were taking over other people and somebody needed to stop this. Am I right?  This one dude was pretty spiffy too, I think I understood what his deal was, I'm not sure though and I won't give it away by explaining what he did. I'm pretty sure I know what happened and why.  Luckily for me I drink a lot of water and I had to go the bathroom about half an hour to the end. Whilst I was up I bought some popcorn to keep me occupied for the rest of the movie. I got back 5 minutes later and found that it didn't make the slightest difference. I was still lost and didn't understand why exactly everything was happening except for the very general idea, that I said before. Good against evil and all that jazz.

        Pull the needles from beneath my skin   Today I wore my hair down for the first time since possibly Halloween when I straightened it for my "costume." I hate my hair. People say it's nice but I think they're lying or are just trying to make me feel better. I don't know. It's horrible though.  But I went to church today with my dad and when I came out some Mexican guy not exactly hit on me but was showing interest in me. Hee. It made me feel purty. Ha. Maybe I will wear my hair down more often if that was what it was. Our pastor is leaving the church in a month. Crazy crazy.  I just looked over and noticed I have 7 water bottles on my desk. They are all empty except one which I'm using as a vase for wildflowers. I went on a bike ride and stopped on the side of the road to pick them. Some guy passed me and a couple feet after that did a U-turn and came back. It was wierd but he looked at me like I was crazy, picking weeds and all on the side of the road and all.  I'm getting up early tomorrow to go to Richmond with my dad. To go to plan 9 music. I think maybe I've said that earlier but I'm not sure.  Oh yeah, I feel loads better than I did yesterday I feel asleep at about 12!! It was great. That's like what...almost 7 hours of sleep! I feel good. This means though that I won't be able to sleep tonight and I have to get up super early to leave for Richmond and I'll be so tired. But that's okay. I'm hoping to get any Built to Spill CD at Plan 9. I really really hope they have one. I'm pretty sure they do but I've only been a couple of times in a couple of years so I don't know. At any rate, I can't find them anyplace else, not Tower, nowhere (except the internet). But I live in the middle of nowhere so that isn't really saying much. Other than Built to Spill, if they don't have that I'm not sure...I have enough money for one CD...Refused. I want a Refused CD. That's all I can really think of. I'll probably just go with another CD from a band I already have CDs from to build up a collection. Most likely Morrissey, The Smiths or The Misfits. I feel like the Smiths though so I'll probably go with that.     Music: Moonlite Dreams - Tiger Army

        She wouldn't hurt a fly...   Gosh I'm beat. I feel really tired but I felt almost chipper for most of the day. I don't know why this was. I was in a super great mood all day. It was strange. It scared me. I just finished watching Psycho. I've always liked that movie. Norman. Whatta guy. But during the entire movie my eyes were fighting sleep. This is not like me.  I got about 4 hours of sleep last night and I was wide awake during the day. When I first got up, by my alarm to go jogging I was incredibly tired and I almost slept in again but I got up and went to the bathroom, praying that it was raining so I'd have an excuse to go back to bed, but it wasn't and I threw some shorts on and went outside. I was wide awake. Madness.  But now I'm tired. But I think the light of the computer is stimulating me or whatever becuase I feel way more awake than I did during my movie.  200 some people have taken my new quiz, 10 people have rated it and it's at like 4.70 or something. The most people that have rated, but my What Quizilla Annoyance Are You quiz has been taken more. I like that quiz.  I've been planning another quiz for a while and now that it's summer and I have loads of free time I'll be able to do it. I just have to plan it out then I'll get to it. My problem is pictures, they never seem to want to cooperate with me.   I got my report card today. These are my final grades for the year:  Semester One  CIS (Computer Information Systems): A World History II: A Gym/Driver's Ed: A --Driver's Ed Exam: A Biology: A  Semester Two  Algebra II: B English: A Latin II: A Computer Programming: A  I exempted all my exams last semster. I'm disappointed at my Algebra II grade. I thought I was going to get an A. I was kind of working hard to get all A's - it's the first final grade that's below an A since I started high school. I kind of you know...wanted to...have all A's...at least for half of high school. I know that's over-achieving and everything and loads of people would love to have my grades but I don't know. I've never had a talent for anything at all and I've always just made good grades so I thought I'd stick to that. I checked my GPA at the begining of the year and it was 4.3 something but I was ranked 8th in my class. One girl gets all A's and B's and was #50 something. My class is full of smart people. Whatever.  I think I'll go to bed way early today. It took me ages to fall asleep last night. Actually, I was in bed trying to sleep at 10:30 and my dad knocked on my door asking if I was awake and wanted to know if he could use my computer real quick, so of course I said yes. He was there a while so I couldn't sleep then but eventually at around 12:30ish I was in that half sleep where in one second I would be asleep but you know, someone wakes you up. My sister came in to tell me her friend was talking to her again. Oh gosh. I'm so glad she told me at 12:30. Geez. After that it didn't feel like I'd ever fall asleep but I did eventually and all.  Oh yeah. Today was a really weird day. Not only was I you know, in a good mood and all but I couldn't remember the morning. It didn't feel like I got up and ran at all. It's strange. I know I did but I don't remember. Maybe it was because I was half asleep when I did or something but whatever it was it's a creepy feeling. Like I was awake but I wasn't or something. I can't explain it. I don't like it though. I hope it doesn't happen tomorrow.   I think I just rambled a whole lot. I think I am half asleep. I don't sleep much, really, I'm always tired. I noticed when I was in front of the bathroom mirror today that it looks like I've been punched in the eye but I haven't. I'm just sleep deprived. I shouldn't really get up and run so early but I don't know. I like to.   My mom just came in and asked for something and I turned around kind of quick when she left and felt weird. My head's all fuzzy and stuff. I think I need a good sleep. I'll probably go to bed in a few minutes even though it's practically still light out.   I know I just rambled a whole lot on nothing. Oh gosh. I really am out of it. I just looked up and saw I already said that. What's wrong with me?     Music: No Love Lost - Joy Division

        Now one..two...three...do me   This morning me and my dad were going to go to this park to bike this trail. We were supposed to leave at 8:30. I normally get up at 6:45 to go jogging but this morning I was so tired I just fell back asleep and woke back up at 8:40 but didn't think anything of it and closed my eyes again but then my mom knocked on my door and asked if I was getting up. I forgot all about having to leave 10 minutes ago.  Me and my dad ended up leaving at 9:10. Turns out he wasn't ready either.  We were on the road but then it started to rain so we turned back. This is the second time this week the rain has...rained on my parade. I have to stop with the puns, that's to entries in a row.  So now I have nothing to do at all. Monday I think I'm going to Richmond with my Dad. I think we have to leave the house at 6:30. He has an eye appointment. He goes to Richmond which is about an hour and a half away because it's this veteren hospital place and he's a veteren and all and they get great stuff there or something like that. I want to go to Plan 9 which is this independently owned record store. They have stuff I can't find anywhere else. And I need a place to go because I hate being stuck at home all the time so I'm going. I love Richmond.   While I was typing that an  ENORMOUS  bug crawled out from somewhere on my desk. I don't know where it came from. It was so nasty. I squealed like a girl. I'm so ashamed. I tryed to pick it up with a tissue (what was I thinking?) but it got out and fell on the floor so I stepped on it and heard it pop. Ew. Man. It was nasty but it's dead now. That was horrible. Normally I don't get scared of bugs and such but it was RIGHT there and really caught me off guard. Besides it wasn't like a spider or anything cool like that. It was horribly horrid bug. I wish I knew where it came from.  What if there are more???      Music: Say Hello to the Angels - Interpol

        Can I get there this way? I think so.   Bad news. Very very bad news.  I had always heard of the controversy over bio-waste. Two people did their camp projects on it the year before last. I thought it was gross but never really thought anything of it. Now it hits home, though. I live right across from a church that is bordered by fields (and a cemetery, of course). It's like acres and acres of fields. Fields that have a nice new spread of sludge.  It smells. Bad. It's so gross. It freaks me out to think of what it is. HUMAN  WASTE  right across from  my   HOUSE . I can't help but always think of...ugh. It's too nasty. I jog that road in the mornings man. It's going to smell so bad. Why would people   use   that stuff??? I know it's like free or whatever but HONESTLY. That's so  revolting . That's human POO man. Makes me shudder.  My dad called some place (I can't remember what exactly) and asked if just anybody can put that stuff down and the lady was hestitant or whatever and said yeah. Apparently they've been getting more than one complaint.  Whatever...hopefully the smell with go away.   So, so far summer has been going alright. Not great but could be a whole lot worse.   Note to Abigail (he he) If you read this I just wanted to tell you that nobody I know reads my blog. It's easy to get things out if I know nobody I know personally will read what I say. Thanks for commenting, your comment made me feel good :]   Oh yes. In music news. I can't wait for  urlLink Tiger Army's  new CD. Also for  urlLink We're All Broken's  CD to come out. They are going to be in Virginia like three times this summer, I'd like to see them perform live if I can get a chance to. The venues are TBA so I'll have to see. Hopefully it'll be someplace close. The furthest I'd go would probably be the Patriot Center, if that. I could stay with my aunt though I think. I've heard two songs from their CD so far and I like them alot. For some reason it, to me, has a little bit of a Cure feel to it. Oh geez. The Cure. I'd like to get their new CD as well. Too many good CDs coming out. Anyway, We're All Broken, that's indie for you. Gotta love it.    Music: Brain Damage - Pink Floyd

        It's not long, is it?   I have to get down to the basics.    My family has no money. At all. I do not what is to become of this.   My mom hasn't told anybody this. My dad and sister don't know. I do. It's killing me.  I'm so worried.   I don't understand why some people have more money than they know what to do with, never doing anything for it and some people work so hard and barely or never make ends meet.  Me, my sister and dad are going to a game on Wednesday and I asked at dinner today, wouldn't we need cash? My dad said yeah...he doesn't expect a thing. My mom was quiet and I could tell she was a little nervous. I feel horrible.   I hate knowing but I also think it's good that I do.  Two CDs I've been looking foward to are coming out at the end of the month and I really want them but I'm not going to buy CDs at a time like this. I feel lousy.  I talked to Shelby the first time in a long while. It was weird. It feels weird to be around anybody I know.   I never RSVPed to Tara. I don't know what that means exactly. I kind of wanted to go but the last party I went to was in 5th grade. I wouldn't know what to do.  Shelby's birthday party is coming up and I know I don't want to go but I know what Shelby will feel like if I don't go  again . I don't know what to do about that.  The problem that I always have is getting to me again and I hate that.  I'm doing the best that I can.  It's not enough.  While I'm complaining. My teeth hurt. Stupid braces.  Which reminds me. Do you have any idea how much braces cost? I still have a lot of surgery to get done on that one part of my mouth. That's going to cost alot. Then I have impacted wisdom teeth. Need to get though cut out too. I wish I didn't have to be so expensive.  I don't know where the day went to. I don't know if this is bad or good.  I'm tired. But not as tired as I was earlier.  At least my head doesn't hurt as bad as it did.    That is all for now.    Music: This Isn't the Tenka-ichi-Budokai - I Hate Myself

        Everybody   I'm so tired. I was pruning bushes in our front yard for a while and that really wore me out. I'm not made for the sun. Have I said that before? It makes me tired and I always get burnt. And I get hot and I don't like being hot. I just prefer shade or indoors or cloudy weather.   I finished the Cadfaels. If you don't know Cadfael it originally was this series of books by Ellis Peters then they made 13 of the books into movies for Public TV. I'm a big fan I love the show and we own all 13 movies. I hadn't seen them in a long time, not since I was pretty young and I decided I'd watch one a while ago and then I ended up watching them all. I like the first series best because I think Hugh Barranger is played the best then. I don't really care for the guy who plays him in the 2nd and 3rd season, the 4th season guy is alright. But in the 4th season Oswin disappears and he's like the greatest so that was disappointing but still they are really good.   Anyway I'm sure if anybody read that that was really boring.  Check out 101 facts about me:  urlLink here . I did that this morning.  I guess that's all. I'm real tired.

I feel sick and worn out now. I don't feel like doing much except maybe taking a shower and watching a little Rocky or Cadfael. Yeah I love that monk.   I'm glad to be back. Very glad. It was a hard trip, really. Mostly I had a really rotten time but some things were okay so it balances out to being 'alright.'     Music: Ted, Just Admit It... - Jane's Addiction

        I hate waiting.   I'm getting ready to go with my mom and sister to visit my aunt and uncle in Alrington (VA). I always am on time but my sister and mom are always at least 30 minutes late for everthing and I hate waiting. So I have nothing to do so I figured I'd just write some nonsense up.  Everything was going okay but I just heard my sister yelling at my mom so it's going to be a bad trip up, I can tell. Four hours. I like road trips, myself. Actually, I just remember I should take different headphones because they keep the sound in more - usually my music can be heard by everyone around me when I'm using my CD player.  I still don't know what I'm going to do about this thing that I found out about yesterday. It's very wrong and horrible but there isn't anything I can do about it. It makes me angry though, but I don't want to get into it because it's not something most people talk about, and I certainly don't - it's one of those things society has made us feel ashamed about. Besides I'd just rant a long time and that's no fun. I'm just trying to cope with it even though it's always there and there isn't any avoiding it. Not this.  I have about a gallon of water and two quart bag ziplocks of cheetos for the trip so I'm good to go. Also I have my CD player a few CDs and a couple books for choice. Should be alright but then I think about this one thing that's going to come up on our trip and it has to do with the thing that I was talking about and that's not going to be very fun but you know - whatever. I have some money for when I go to Tower but I can't decide on what I'm going to get yet. I think I have enough for two CDs - depending on the price I might be able to get 3. Or maybe two CDs and a cassette. I don't know yet.    " Yo Adrien! "    Music: Short Pause/Long Pause - We're All Broken

        Oh my sweet rapture...   My teeth hurt so bad. I hate braces. More trouble than they are worth. I hope they are worth it. I have to remember next time I have an appointment to make pudding before I go so I can eat that afterwards. I'm not sure but I don't think pudding is vegetarian. I could be wrong but I think that's right. But in anyway, I don't care. I love eating pudding when my teeth hurt. Ha. My mom tells me to just eat soup or ramen but why do that when you can eat pudding.  When I first got my braces my teeth hurt for days and I lived off pudding and ramen. I would make the Top Ramen then cut up the noodles in the broth and then just drink it with the 2" noddles whole - not even bothering to try and chew. Those were good days. I stayed on that diet longer than I had to because I liked the excuse to eat it.   I've been watching an average of at least three movies a day since school got out.

        Check this out   Question 1:  If you knew a woman who was pregnant, who had 8 kids already, three who were deaf, two who were blind, one mentally retarded, and she had syphilis, would you recommend that she have an abortion?  Read the next question before looking at the answer for this one.   Question 2:  It is time to elect a new world leader, and only your vote counts. Here arethe facts about the three leading candidates.  Candidate A - Associates with crooked politicians, and consults with astrologists. He's had two Mistresses. He also chain smokes and drinks 8 to 10 martinis a day. Candidate B - He was kicked out of office twice, sleeps until noon, used opium in college and drinks a quart of whiskey every evening. Candidate C - He is a decorated war hero. He's a vegetarian, doesn't smoke, drinks an occasional beer and never cheated on his wife.  Which of these candidates would be your choice?   Candidate A is Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Candidate B is Winston Churchill.  Candidate C is Adolph Hitler.  And, by the way, the answer to the abortion question: If you said yes, you just killed Beethoven.  Pretty interesting isn't it? Makes a person think before judging someone. Never be afraid to try something new. Remember: Amateurs built the ark. Professionals built the Titanic.   Can you imagine working for a company that has a little more than 500 employees and has the following statistics:  29 have been accused of spousal abuse  7 have been arrested for fraud  19 have been accused of writing bad checks  117 have directly or indirectly bankrupted at least 2 businesses  3 have done time for assault  71 cannot get a credit card due to bad credit  14 have been arrested on drug-related charges  8 have been arrested for shoplifting  21 are currently defendants in lawsuits  84 have been arrested for drunk driving in the last year  Can you guess which organization this is? Give up yet?  It's the 535 members of the United States Congress.  The same group of idiots that crank out hundreds of new laws each year designed to keep the rest of us in line. You gotta pass this one on.

        So calm down. Release your cares. The stale taste of recycled air.   So this is the first real official day of summer vacation.  The past weekend I've been watching movies, sitting in the computer chair not doing anything, filling out those stupid surveys, listening to music and eating junk food.  That's how my entire summer is going to be.  I'm not exactly happy with that prospect. I have something I want to work on this summer but I'm not going to start it until next week. I want at least my first week of summer break to be easygoing.   I might be going into town later with my sister to rent some movies. I hope so. I want to rent:     Night of the Living Dead (I haven't seen it yet, isn't that horrible?)  Event Horizon (Love that movie)   Something else that I can't remember as of now. Maybe I'll rent Resident Evil. I told Michael I would sometime over the summer. I might wait till later into break to though. I'm thinking about renting Donnie Darko again. It seems like everybody loves that movie. I think I'm missing something about the movie.  I hope we go into town today at least. I need something to do.  My sister's been in a good mood lately. I'm so surprised but very glad. I was in the den yesterday afternoon, curled up in my fleece blanket with a few DVDs and my sister came in and laid on the couch and started watching Master and Commander with me. It was great. She usually doesn't like me at all but we had a pretty good time. I've seen it twice before then and she'd only seen it once and she had missed a whole lot and I was explaining some things to her. I saw it in English class and Mrs. Dirks had explained alot to us that I would never had known if it wasn't for her. I'll miss her.  After that I asked her if she wanted to stay and watch Reservoir Dogs with me and she didn't want to see it but asked if we could watch The Crow. So I went and got that and we watched that.   It was a pleasant afternoon.    Music: Love Buzz - Nirvana

        I didn't stop at the street   Today was a good day. I had a good time with Tara, I'm so relieved. The vegetarian place wasn't open though so we walked down to the Lighthouse Cafe only to find that it was out of business so we went to this one restaurant called Cheese and Company which I had always seen but didn't know anything about. I was amazed! I had no idea there was a place like that around here. I always thought it was this little shop that sold cheese and sausages and stuff on a glass counter and there were a few tables and chairs for people sampling or something because all I see through the windows were like two tables in front. I thought it was a tiny little place but it's huge! It's like the biggest store on Main Street. And it was so adorable. It reminded me of a place you'd see art students, doning french barets and sipping tea.  Luckily, true to my stereotype they had vegetarian options. It was a super long hot walk to the movie but it was good.   Being in the sun and heat for a while always makes me so tired but I want to stay up and see Modest Mouse on Jimmy Kimmel live which comes on at 12:35 so I have a while. I'm killing time.   Natalie told me about this new newspaper that I might be able to get a job for! That is so cool! She's so awesome! We're going to go meet the lady tomorrow around noon. I hope that goes well. I really do.   So this was the last day of school, I can't believe it. It doesn't feel like it. Graduation feels too close.   Oh yeah, I know I'm jumping around alot but my sister was at Wal Mart today and she said she saw a mime! That is so awesome! I am  so  jealous.     Music: Sink to the Beat - Cursive

        Two years til I can get out of this place.   If my parents don't split up as soon as us kids are off in college I admit I'll be surprised. Two years, we'll see what happens. Who knows, something may happen before then. But mostly, I've been watching them alot and thinking about it alot and I think the only reason they are still together is me and my sister. I think so. I hate that. That makes me so sad. But maybe it will get better after we leave...we are usually the object of the argument so maybe...Who knows.  I'm going to school tomorrow after staying home three days it's going to be weird, I won't feel like getting up I know. I wouldn't go but I'm going to Farmville with Tara after school. And I'd like to say goodbye to a few folks I guess, since I didn't Monday. I'll turn in my Latin textbook, too. Oh yeah, and beg to turn in my college form late. If they turn me away I'm planning to plead about needing this because I need as much financial aid that I can get...they don't want to shatter my dreams of going to college, do they?  I hope tomorrow goes well with Tara. I'm so nervous. Haha. I'm not big on just "hanging out" with people. I'm no good at making conversation or anything like that. I can either make really light conversation that takes about a minute and a half of time or really deep intellectual conversation. There is no inbetween.   Read  Whale Talk  by Chris Crutcher. It's the best book I've read in ages. I'm already planning to read it again this summer.     Music: End of Time - Danzig

        Can you feel my love buzz?   I've been out of school before anybody else in my school because of my good attendence and good grades. Meaning I don't have to take exams and my teachers are saying staying home if you don't have to come because they have nothing for us that aren't taking the exams. So I did and am. But I'm going in Friday because I have to turn in my Latin textbook and also I'm going to Farmville with Tara after school and then we're going to go see a movie.  I'm nervous but happy. I don't usually do anything with anybody so this is way out of my norm and that makes me nervous. I'm not so great around other people. I get awkward and don't know what to do or say.  I hope we have a good time though.   Gah. I need to trim my nails. I let them get to long. I hate them long but they grow so fast.     Music: Sick of Modern Art - The Explosion

        You can't fix those   Oh I'm so bored.  I've nothing to do. I fixed my pants this morning. That took a good hour I guess but now I'm left with nothing. My dad and sister are going to this thing at this place. I don't really want to go, I don't really know what it is but I think there are going to be lots of people around and I'm not big on that. Besides, my sister would probably kill me if I went. She doesn't like me very much.  My mom is going to the store today and normally I would go just to get out of the house and maybe look at the CDs though they never have anything I listen to and I would die if they did but I don't really want to go.  So I do have options to relieve my boredom but I'm not taking them so I have no one to blame but myself.    Music: Nothing

        What are you doing here?   Nothing happened today. I had a day of complete, utter, unbearably sufferable boredom.  And it's not even summer yet. Cue the long sigh.   I went to see Harry Potter III Friday. It was pretty good. I saw my Latin teacher! Very exciting! He. I saw the preview for Hilary Duff's new movie. I used extreme self-control to refrain from running out and slitting my wrists.   I'll be so glad when school's out so I can get an orthadontist appointment finally. I need one badly.   I talked to Shelby for the first time in a really long time. It was crazy. I can't remember the last time I talked to Amanda. The only friends I have...I don't know what to say about it...but...it's like...they didn't go to school with me but they were still always there. But it's not like that anymore. I should have known we wouldn't be able to keep that up this long. It's been too long. We'll see what summer holds. Though I bet they both have big plans and are going to be doing something with someone almost everyday. My summer's are like my weekends. I sit around with nothing to do, listening to the same CDs, jumping at the opportunity to go anywhere with anybody in my house(to the dump, the grocery store, wherever). That's it.  I'm trying to think of things I can do this summer to keep me occupied. Next summer will be different. I'll have my license by then. Too bad I can get it at the end of this summer. Lousy timing. Anyways...things to do..things to do this summer...    Type up lyrics. Yay. That can only last so long. I only have so many CDs  Start with the first CD on my collection and listen to each until the last.   Read. This isn't working out too good for me. One of those books I bought from my list already isn't that great. And so I started another one because I'm book-snobbish and can't be bothered with books less than anything I expected or want. The one I started is alright...I actually am willing myself to finish it though I don't really want to.   Clean my room. This'll take what? Not even a day.  Watch movies  I could study Latin...I haven't really learned much...I just always memorized grammar rules for quizzes and tests...I didn't learn. Actually this is just something I  should  do. I'm definetly not going to.  Draw...that sounds so lame but it does keep me occupied as long as I'm inspired. School is usually my inspiration though - school related things like peers and stress and stuff...   School really is my life, I'm sad to admit. I think for most teens it is. But for most teens they have lives outside of school. That is where I am at a fault. That's okay though. I guess. It just gets so boring and lonesome sometimes. I don't like to admit being lonely but it does. Sometimes I do get lonely.     Music: Angelfuck - The Misfits

        "I'm tired, so tired..."   I feel like I could drop dead asleep any second. By the drop of a hat I'd be out. I need a really good night's sleep because I have my SOL tomorrow for Algebra II. You know, you have to get a "good night's sleep" before a big thing like that. And eat a good breakfast and all that jazz. I used to eat breakfast every single morning and knew how important it was and told other people so.  But the end of the year...I do less and less homework, I just don't care and do sloppy half-ass jobs on all my school work and I sleep later and later. I wake up and just am too lazy and tired to get up and go eat so I just lay around, trying to get a little more shut-eye, then get up, get dressed and by then it's time to leave and I go.  I used to have my alarm at 6:20 now it's gone to 7:15. Haha. Pretty bad, huh? Actually...now that I think about it...I could set it a little later if I really wanted to (I do). It takes me maybe 5 minutes to get ready for school. Find some clothes that are reasonably clean, throw them on then grab my book bag, and leave. Simple.   I am worried about my test tomorrow. I hope I'm not dead tired.   I need to do my Latin homework. Luckily, I had time to do my essay earlier so I don't have to do that now. I'm going to do my latin then I'm going to bed. Bed bed bed bed. Sleep sleep sleep sleep. Lovely, lovely sleep. Lush pillows and soft sheets. Gentle breeze from my ceiling fan. Quiet whirl of the fan. Annoying rattling from my fan. Stupid fan. I don't know what's wrong with it. Anyways, back to my lovely fantasy. You know that moment you lay down in bed and it feels so good to relax after a long, long day. Laws! Sleep is nice.    I've been having the Huck Finn dialect in my head since we've been reading/read it. Everytime something happens I think either "Laws" or "Landsakes" and other Southern dialect things. It's crazy. I shouldn't say it either, being already in the South and all.     Music: Made-up Dreams - Built to Spill

        Not until the man does   And I thought I had a lot of homework to do last night! Geez! Honestly, before I wasn't looking foward to summer that much but it's looker more and more worthwhile. Aye yi yi. What's up with Tom Sawyer? He's so stupid! Why is he making Jim and Huck do all this stupid stuff instead of just getting Jim free in a day? What's the point? What's up with all this, "It's not regular" garbage. What could have been summed up in about 5 pages is drawning onto a hundred. Honestly.  I liked the book a whole lot but now that I have to read 90 pages in one night along with the essay we've been working on all semester - redoing half of it - answering the stupid questions on the thousand pages we have to read (okay, just 90 but it seems like way more to a slow reader), my stupid latin translation which I might just blow off alltogether, then I had to do this entire SOL practice test for Algebra II. That just takes the piss. But I answered letters that looked nice..."C for Curtis, D for Danzig, A for Adam, C for Carson, D for Davey" and so forth and so on.   I am on page 267 and still have to get to 293 so I've done a whole lot of reading but still.   I love to read,  Unless I have to.    As I procrastinate further so I'll be up all night with my homework I thought I'd write about something funny that happened just a little while ago as I sat down to write up this whiney rant on my homework.  My sister comes in all shocked asking if I smoked. I was like surprised, I don't believe in that at all but maybe I seem like the type of person who would smoke? I don't know. I don't know how I seem to anybody (barely myself). Then I remembered fourth period today when David said he was going to tell my dad I smoked. But he wasn't serious or anything. So I said, "Have you talked to David?" And when I said it it was like I was surprised because the thought just came to me - I just remembered 4th period and knew that had to be what she was talking about. Naturally my surprise was taken to the wrong way, she probably thought I was caught smoking by him. Hahah.  Man. So she was saying how it smelled like cigarettes outside the bathroom (which is right outside my room) (nobody in my family smokes). So I went out and I didn't smell anything.  I told her that I think  she's  smoking something, but it isn't cigarettes.  I better get to work...    Music: Armaggedon - Alkaline Trio

        What me worry?   I don't understand how we are supposed to appreciate good literature if we have to read it at such an alarming rate. I mean sometimes I wonder if teachers realize how hard it is to read thirty thousand chapters of a book in one night.  I know, I know it's not their problem that we have other class and other things to do when we get home. I know it's not their problem that we have exams and SOLs in classes other than theirs coming up that we are studying for. I know it's not their problem that their class isn't the only one packing on the homework right at the end of the year. But still.   I think...I don't want to jinx it by saying anything...but I think for the most part I'm in the clear for the rest of the year in Latin class. I asked Mr. Davis if we were going to be taking any tests between now and the exam and he said no, he planned on it earlier but can't anymore. I'm exempting from the exam so basically as long as I do my translation every night I don't have to pay attention anymore. I think. Can't be this good to be true though...

        So what befalls the flawless?   So today.    I went with Sarah and Shana to Lynchburg, to the dollar theatre to see Troy at 4  I was too young to get into Troy, and they check IDs so we couldn't go see that  Nothing else good was playing so we...  Went to Golden Corale (can't spell) and ate dinner  Then I got horribly, horribly sick  I started feeling a little better so we...  Went to the mall, with no money  We went to FYE where I felt like I'd pass out  We left after about 10 minutes.  I had taken money to buy a CD but Sarah forgot she needed gas so there went my money for a CD, and the money I was going to be using for the concert Wednesday (but I still have more so it should be alright) (That's not all that clear - I have been saving money for Wed. and I took some of it to Lynchburg with me, to buy a CD, even though I should have used it for the show).  I felt like poop the entire ride home.  We dropped Shana off, and came home  This is around 8, by the way  I listened to quietish music and chatted with Shelby  I feel better now, luckily  I can't remember the last time I was sick    I believe that is all. So no movie today. I could never pass as 17 anyway, even if I lied and said my ID was at home. Everyone mistakes me for a 9th grader just because I'm in the highschool, outside of school everyone thinks I'm about 12/13. I turn 16 in less than a month. Stupid stupid.  If anybody sees this and has the CD "Excuses for Travelers" from Mojave 3, is it worth buying? Please let me know...Also Snow Patrol's "Final Straw" is that any good? Hey, while I'm at it, how about these CDs too... "()" - Sigur Ros "Happy Songs for Happy People" - Mogwai "Rooney" - Rooney "God's Own Medicine" - The Mission UK "Kill Them with Kindness" - The Jealous Sound "Earth is Not a Cold Dead Place" - Explosions in the Sky  I think that's all...I've read reviews and everything but I like to be sure I won't regret buying a CD if I get it.

        No square's needed when you're around   I was going to write something in here but then I realized when I got this far that I didn't have anything to say.  I talked to Amanda this morning on the internet.   I'm really freaked out about getting my impacted wisdom teeth extracted because my friend Lauren had her's out a week ago and I was reading about her experience on her Live Journal. Terrible.  I see Tiger Army in a week and a day.    Music: Generation 666 - Nekromantix

      I've been getting exicited recently, since I realize I'll be seeing Tiger Army very soon. Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army  Enough of that.  I love their new CD. I think it's been long enough so I can say I really really enjoy it. It's so much more mellow and at first I thought I wouldn't like it but I was proved wrong. Horray. Fred Hell can't play though, that's sad. I was so worried they wouldn't be able to do Warped but they are. Horray again.  I'm just nervous about Warped Tour. I really don't... like  any of the bands playing. Just Tiger Army. Bad Religion's pretty good, as is Anti-Flag. Maybe Flogging Molly will be cool. That's about all that comes to mind. We're All Broken isn't showing up on the Warped Tour website so are they going to be there or not?  I don't really want to admit to going to Warped Tour. (Sorry.) But I'm not missing one of my favorite bands coming to Virginia. Nobody ever comes to Virginia.  I'm worried though because I imagine Warped Tour will just be a bunch of teenager girls panicing when they see their favorite pop punk band. You know those type of people? And they always crowd up, trying to get to the front so it gets all crazy and stupid.  Stupid teenage girls.  Too bad I am a teenage girl.  I'm just saying most of the people there will be like that. I THINK. I don't know. I've never been.  Shelby will want to see a lot of the bands I don't really like, I know. Story of the Year, Yellowcard and all that jazz. I won't bail out on her or anything though, I probably wouldn't be able to find her if I left. Oh yeah, I just remember nofx should be good.  Anyway. What was I saying? Shelby likes bands I don't like. Yeah. Well whatever.   I'm so bored. So bored bored bored bored bored bored bored. I was so bored I typed that more than needed. I need somewhere to go.   Oh yeah I hear Catwoman is bad. Hahahaha. I so knew it. I love being right. From the first time I saw the preview I knew it'd be lousy. The average critic vote on Yahoo is D+. Oh man. Hahaha. That's so sad.     Music: He Who Laughs Last... - AFI

        I love the smell of napalm in the morning   Nothing's been happening around here.  I want to go see the Village when it comes out. I saw I, Robot. It was pretty good. It takes a lot to impress me though.   What's today? School starts the 30th of August. That's way too soon. But I just want to get it over with. At least there's winter break to look foward to.   I really don't know what I've been doing all day these days. Watching a lot of movies I guess. My sister rented Cold Mountain the other day and I was watching it yesterday morning but when I had about 20 minutes left my dad had to go and he was going to turn the movie in, so I didn't get to see the last 20 minutes. It was good so far though.   I can't really think of anything else to add... I guess I don't really need to worry about making posts interesting or anything since nobody reads this anyway. Though I saw people have visited my profile. That's neat.     Music: Am I Missing - Dashboard Confessional

        I'll lay me down tonight   Woah. Blogger got all... snazzy . So much for being special for knowing basic HTML.   I have a "consultation" with my oral surgeon today at 11:15 in Lynchburg, so I have to leave around 10. I am so sick of  consultations . That's all I do, nothing ever gets done, they just talk to me about what will get done to my teeth. I was at the orthadontist Wednesday and he said that anytime after two weeks go in to Dr. Todd and get all that stuff we've talked about so many times done. That puts my surgery right around the time I go to the Warped Tour. I don't really want to be in all that pain and everything while I'm rocking out to Tiger Army (ha ha), so this time  I  might be the one pushing things back. Oh, the irony.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I watched Jeopardy last night, because I wanted to see that guy who's been winning so much. It made me so sad. I feel so bad for the other people, who get left behind in the dust because that one guy is so smart. How can anybody be so smart?? He has to be cheating...somehow.... I mean, how can anybody remember that much?? I remember things for tests, then I forget everything. But I guess that's just me.... I was rooting on the other guys, namely Lou because he has such a happenin' name. Lou Lou Lou. So cool. This one guy, Tom I think, got a Daily Double and he like doubled his score and was  ahead  of whats-his-name and I was so excited but then Ken (that's his name) went ahead of him. He irks me... &nbsp; I refuse to be bought by this easy HTMLing.

Didn't mean to make you cry If I'm not back again this time tomorrow Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters  Too late, my time has come Sends shivers down my spine Body's aching all the time Goodbye everybody - I've got to go Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth Mama, oh...(anyway the wind blows) I don't want to die I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

        Cover my face as the animals die   It's going to be a lousy, boring day today.   I've been playing the Harry Potter games on the computer since yesterday and I'm almost through with the first one. I think this is the 3rd time I will have beaten it. I've never finished the second one and haven't really gotten very far into it at all but I plan to after I finish the first. Then I'll probably play the LoTR game which I've never even tryed to play. Beyond Atlantis frustrates me since I got so far on the old computer but, having switched, I lost my game and have to start all over again. No fun.   Some folks are really weird...   The middle of this week marks the half-way point of summer break. I just can't really accept that. I haven't done anything. It feels like school has been out just a week or two. I remember in 8th grade we had to write an essay, a persuasive essay on whether school should be like it is, with the long summer break or have year-round schooling, and every 4 or 5 (can't remember exactly) weeks you have one week off, and 2 weeks off for Christmas, and like 3 sometime during the summer. I was the only one who supported the latter. I like breaks spread out evenly. A long break seems nice but when it's over it's over...you have such a long way to go before the next break. I hate that.  If I was ever to be in a band I would swear to never do any covers, remixes or acoustic versions of songs already produced. And never get interviewed by any teen magazine, Alternative Press, or anything like that. Probably just indie mags like Law of Inertia or fan zines. Yep.  So boring. x_X    Music: The Chicken Song - AFI

        I like small titles   Today is Shelby's birthday! I called her at 7:11 (because her birthday's 7/11) but she was in Chesterfield so I just asked her sister if she could tell her I said Happy Birthday. This is really kind of a relief to me because I don't really like talking on the phone. It makes me nervous.  I was thinking of something someone said to me months and months ago and I finally thought of the perfect thing I should have said. I hate that. But don't worry, it's not like I was stressing over it all that time, it just randomly came into my thoughts and I thought of it. I thought about it alot when it first happened, though.  I've been listening to a lot of old mixes today. Back in the days I used to use Kazaa all the time. I do miss using it, though. At first when I got rid of it it didn't bother me at all but it does now. But I don't think I'd ever download it again because it makes my computer so slow and sickly. And then I'd have to get rid of my anti-spyware/adware program. Blah blah. Lots of work for just problems. I never cared about getting caught for downloading songs, though. I guess that's sad but hey.   Music - Give Me the Pen - Desaparecidos

        Feelin' kinda trapped, I've gotta go   I love the All Music Guide's review of Walk Among Us. The end is the best: Everything ends with the giddily ridiculous  "Braineaters"  in which the chanting voices of the band bemoan their  constant diet of cerebella and ask for intestines instead , but the real freaked-out highlight comes smack dab in the middle with "Mommy Can I Go Out and Kill Tonight." Taken from the show made up of the Evilive release, it starts out on the edge and, after Danzig delivers the title sans instruments, turns into an  explosion of rhythm and feedback that should have killed everything within 50 feet of the amps.   So great.   Shelby called me today around noon. I was so happy for a long time after that. Shelby Shelby Shelby. Her birthday is tomorrow! I hope she feels better...she's sick. :( And her party's today...I don't know if she's mad I'm not coming or not...I don't think so...she said she wasn't or anything like that...but a lot of people are bailing out...I don't know why...that's so sad. I would go if I had any guts at all. I'm definetly going to her 18th. I will go to her 18th no matter what. No chance I'll get out of the next one. No, no chance at all. No chance whatsoever. Nope.      Music: Malleus Maleficarum - AFI

        It serves me right to suffer   I went to see Shana's dance recital thing at the college today and then she, Sarah and I went to Burger King for lunch. I got a Veggie burger and it took so long to cook (not many requests for veggie burgers) the lady gave us each free apple pies. That was so sweet. So go eat at Burger King because they are nice people!  Then I got home and didn't do anything then I trimmed my hair and now I have nothing to do. Except sit around and bemoan inwardly to myself about why I'm such a loser, failure, curse upon humanity. Is bemoan a word? I think I've seen/heard it before. My hair feels a lot lighter. I want to cut a lot of it but I don't know. I've always wanted to cut it very short and use gel on it because I think it'd be easier to manage. But what if it turns out badly or it doesn't look right on me? Stick with what you know. Change is bad.   I can't really think of anything else to say.   Oh right!! Take my quiz on quizilla! :  urlLink What song are you?   I would appreciate it greatly if somebody did!!! It has good results, including songs by The Smiths, I Hate Myself and Joy Division. 9 results in all! Ha. Nobody's taken it...I'm such a loser.    I don't know what I'm going to do with myself.

        A single touch before I fade   I tell you, I'm just not made for the sun. It makes me hot and burn. It's uncomfortable and will make you all sweaty. Why do so many people like summer? I'm moving to Canada. Or The Netherlands. Maybe Finland. Possibly Russia. I was out picking up trash on the side of the road and  forgot  to wear sunscreen. I didn't forget, I did think about it but I always end up blowing the thought off. I shouldn't. I'm so pale/fair/sensitive. I think I got a little burnt. With my luck I'll probably end up getting a little tan. Blech. But anyways, with the whole trash thing. The majority of litter is soda bottles, cans and beer bottles and cans. Mainly Budweiser cans is what I always see. I asked my dad why so many people like Budwieser and he said something like maybe it's not that most people drink Bud more than any other beer, but maybe the people that drink it are more likely to litter. That makes sense, if you think about it. I mean someone that drinks Water with their Tofu Mushroom Wraps are probably way less likely to litter, you know? And folks that love their kegs and cheetos are more likely to litter, in a stereotypical kind of thinking. I got my Warped Tour tickets from UPS yesterday. Madness! They were supposed to come in like two weeks before the event I thought...and it's not until August 4th. I don't know what they are doing coming in so early...now I have a longer time to make sure I don't lose them.    I'm so sick, so sick of myself. Mother, say you'll pray for me. I'm so sick, so sick of myself. I'm premature in my decay.   I was wearing latex gloves outside and I can't get rid of the smell from my hands. -____- It's lousy.   I like kiwi.  I saw King Arthur with Sarah yesterday. I give it a C.   I think that's about all.  I bought eye drops today.   I need to clean my room.    Music:  Blue in the Face - Alkaline Trio

        Rubbin' 'em down   Haven't posted in a long time it seems. I'm getting back into old addictions. Namely, Exile III : Ruined World. Download the huge demo from  urlLink Spiderweb Software . Oh how I love that game. I'm pretty slammin' at it too. Heh.  I've been logging my driving hours because you need a certain number to get your license or something and I totaled 4 hours and 75 minutes. Long way to go. I drove in town for the first time yesterday. Up until then I have just been on the back country roads that nobody goes on. Honestly, city kids, I don't know how/where you learn to drive. You brave kids, you. It wasn't bad because I was going by the school and the residential area so the speed limit didn't go above 35 MPH which is what I've been driving mostly. My dad doesn't like me going faster than that and sometimes I don't but on straight-stretches sometimes I find myself going faster than I think I am. Something like that.  I think I'm going to go see King Author today with Sarah. She likes the chick from Pirates of the Carribean and all that Medeival (sp?) stuff, which I also think is cool (the Medieval stuff, not the chick - she annoys me because she's so gorgeous when she was just 17. I mean, it's just wrong for someone to have so much luck and some of us don't get any.). I like seeing movies. In the summer I get frustrated because normally I'll wear a hoodie or jacket and take in drinks and candy and stuff so I don't have to pay those outrageous prices at the cinema. But in the summer it's way too hot and wierd to wear a hoodie.   Weird or wierd? I've never known.  I wish I could sleep in. I can't wake up after 7. It's very frustrating.  Shelby's Birthday is coming up. I can't believe she's going to be 17. I don't have very much money to get her a gift...I hate buying gifts...I'm too insecure to think anything I'd get is good enough. You know what I mean? I have something for her already but I think I should get her something else with it because she is a good friend and all and my gift cost me like nothing. However much CD-Rs cost. Can you guess what it is?  I haven't been doing anything this summer. Oh yeah. We're All Broken is signed up for a couple Warped Tour shows, including the one I'm going to. So I get to see them, but I was right when I guessed they'd play sometime this summer at Alley Katz in Richmond, they are on the 18th of August. I'm a little disappointed that they will be playing the Warped Tour. I have troubles with being too much of an elitest for alot of things. I wanted to go see them in Richmond where there would be like nobody there...you know...like just indie kids into music nobody's heard of. Pompous indie elitests, which I can be sometimes. But it's not hard to be around here where nobody's even heard of the Misfits for heaven's sake. Of course I'm going to feel a little superior, you know? What was I saying? Warped Tour, yeah, now everyone's going to see them. What if they get... mainstream . I shudder to think...  I do feel bad because lots of indie and punk rocker kids make it out to seem like they don't want their bands to be successful, like myself. I know that's wrong. I can't help it.  Oh I did get way off subject. I was saying I haven't done much this summer. It feels like school is really close to starting. Sometimes I'm real excited for it to start, wanting to get it over and done with, I hate being on the edge of waiting for it - knowing there's no way of getting out of it - might as well just start now and all that, you know? But other times I want it to stay as far off as possible. I want to see when the half-way mark of summer break is. I'll count later.

        Is my timing that flawed?   I wrote a long post about how super yesterday was but it got deleted. To sum it up: I love Amanda, Spiderman II is totally gnarly, and I like happiness.  On to other things. My dad took me out driving today. I'm getting more used to it I think. I'm still having a little trouble because I'm learning stick-shift because I'll be driving the old '86 Honda Accord. The stupid piece of shit is what I think to myself. It's great. I get to load it up with bumper stickers so it'll be so run-down and tacky. So cool. I was saying all this to Amanda and she said, "I've never heard anybody talk like you." That made me laugh. I know it is weird to want a bad car but I do. I've picked out my Misfits sticker already and have AFI ones that I got a long time ago. I'll probably get an EBHC (East Bay Hard Core) sticker. I'm even thinking of getting that Misfits Licence Plate border from infinity1.com - how super would that be?  I've never seen one, but how about a Joy Divison sticker? If I could find one that'd be great.But anyway.  Today is my parent's 19th anniversary. I don't know how they do it other than my dad is probably the most patient man you'll ever meet. I always wonder if they stay together for me and my sister and wonder what'll happen when we both leave the house. It's kind of scary since it's been more than once that a divorce threatened. I don't like to think about that though.   I feel like watching Rocky. I watch a lot of movies.  I'm so ready for school to start. Summer is so boring. I know I don't sound like myself but I had a really good 2nd semester before summer started and didn't want it to end because usually school never goes well for me. I don't know why it was getting better. I think it's because I've matured and all that jazz and I've tryed to make the most of things and everything. In any case, I can't wait to graduate and I'm one year closer. Alot of people I know will be graduating next year and then it's me. It's strange how quickly school passes. You're in 6th grade and so far off and think it'll never end and you want it so desperatly to speed up but now that I'm going to be in 11th grade I regret wanting it to pass and for being miserable. I should have tried harder to not let school get me down.   I was on livejournal looking at the latest posts. I do that alot. It gives me something to do. Surveys and quizzes galore and all that. But anyway. Somebody posted this line from an emo song and if anybody sees this and knows where it's from, can you comment and tell me? It sounds kind of worth looking into.   I carved your name into the bullet so everyone knows that you're the last thing to go through my head.   It might be a little different because I looked up on google "...bullet so now you know that..." because that was the original wording from the person's post, but the only result I got was the line above from somebody else's blog that wasn't even up.  I think that is all. I think I might sleep in tomorrow. I'm not sure though. Depends on how I feel or when I fall asleep. Something like that.     Music: Radio - Alkaline Trio

        I want a lover I don't have to love. I want a girl who's too sad to give a fuck.   I can't stop listening to Sing the Sorrow. I don't know what it is. I normally don't listen to it, and kind of look down on it because that's the CD that made AFI popular. But I can't help myself I guess. I know it's a stupid reason to look down on a CD, so I guess I'm getting over it or something. I'm listening to alot of AFI, actually. It's strange. I don't want to be obsessed.  Me and Sarah still aren't talking.  I got a phone call from the school today. They say I can't take SAT Prep because the only times it's offered is during my college classes and Latin III. So my choices were Ecology, Biology II, Desktop Publishing or PreCal.  PreCal it is. Ecology is stupid, Biology II has too many disections, Desktop Publishing is...I mean come on...Desktop Publishing. So I get two maths this year. I hate math. I don't really have to take Calculus but I know I will next year because if I don't take a math in senior year I won't remember any math at all when I go to college. I forget things too easily.

        Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon, though down this road we've been many times   Me and my sister currently aren't talking.  	Saturday me and my sister went to see the Village. Afterwards she asked if we could go to WalMart so she could buy some SweeTarts. I was like fine...whatever. We do that often after seeing movies and we get into WalMart and to the candy aisle and Sarah expects me to carry them for whatever reason. And of course I do because I'm nice like that. 	We are walking out of WalMart and Sarah says she's hungry. I told her I know...she's said that already. I said, "Knowing you, you'd want to go get a Whopper, Fries and a Drink and we're going to be eating dinner in 2 hours." We got into the car and was sitting there and everything and I wasn't saying anything. I didn't want her to go to Burger King because I knew she's get that and I know we'd be eating in 2 hours or less. That's not right. But eventually after sitting in the parking lot not saying anything I suddenly say (not very meanly, just in a I-give-up kind of voice), "I don't care, do whatever you want." I didn't really finish saying this because Sarah had slapped me before I could.  	I must admit I'm sick of her being mean to me and I think that was when I decided I wasn't going to put up with her today because I'm tired of being so submissive and everything. So I asked her why she always has to hit me and everything and she was like, "I'm not going anywhere." Blah blah and we started to drive away. I don't know how it came about but Sarah stopped in the parking lot and told me to get out. Get out? Fine...So I did and walked to WalMart. 	I went to the bags and looked for one, to see if I could take anything to the show but didn't so I went to the CDs because I knew she would find me there and I knew she'd be come crawling back. 	I'm looking around at I see her coming up and she is angry. Boy is she angry. She grabs my arm and tries to drag me out. I threaten to scream, I tell her she knows I will and I know I will. This struggle goes on for a while and eventually we are in a corner surrounded by sound-systems and TVs and Sarah hits my face, my glasses go flying behind some TVs. She tells ME to go pick up my glasses. I tell her no and try to walk away but Sarah won't let me get away that easy.  	I tryed not to, I really tryed hard not to but I started to cry. Really. My face was all red, more from trying to hold in my crying. I put my face in my hands and tryed so hard not to cry. Sarah goes looking for my glasses. I take this chance to get away. I nearly run over some guy that works there. I'm walking through WalMart, can't see much and my face is all red and I'm trying not to cry. 	This is a very pathetic scene. I can only imagine what people thought that saw me. Sarah catches up to me, gives me my glasses and once again uses brute force to convince me that we ought to be getting home by now. I manage my way to the produce section where I tell Sarah I'm staying here and I'm going to call our parents for a ride home. She tells me she'd be in so much trouble if she came home without me. GOOD. She should be in trouble. I was still red in the face, half crying, really holding back.  	This always happens. I don't cry but when I do I cry like nobody's business. It's because there are a lot of times I could cry/should cry/need to cry but don't and I think something sort of big sets me off and everything comes crashing down at once and everything catches up to that one cry. It's pretty awful. 	Anyway. I was so appalled at how cruel Sarah could be. She was making me CRY in front of all those people and still she was being so cold and heartless. I once again told her I would scream. I asked her if she really wanted to get the police and security involved in this, because anybody can see I'm in no fault here. She had me in her tight grasp, my arms were red from where she had grabbed me and she had my arm bent in a painful fashion. She said, "Deep down I know you care, you say you don't but I know you care about making a scene, but I don't." Oh? So I say, "LET ME GO!" Loudly. She backs off a little. Looks like someone does care about making a scene, but it's not me.  	Eventually she tells me to come on once again and I'm not stupid so I go. We walk in the parking lot and this is when I really start to break down.  	We get in the car and it's all over. I sob for a good 15 minutes. I know it's a stupid reason to cry but I really couldn't help it. The times I cry are always stupid times to cry.  	I'm sick of putting up with Sarah. The entire time I was in the back of the car pitifully crying away, wiping my snot on my jeans and all that jazz. Not one apology. Not one "are you okay?". Nothing. We get home. Guess who's still mad. What the hell? So I go to my room and everything and my mom eventually comes up, asking what happened. I told her she can ask Sarah. She tells me Sarah told her and was coming upstairs to ask me for the real story (ha ha). I told her I'm done with it, forget about it, I don't care anymore. Really I was far from as upset as I was.  	I eventually gave in and I started out so apathetically, like I didn't care and everything but when we got to the part where I started to cry in the middle of the store I started to choke up again. I told my mom how I don't understand how someone can be that angry, and stay that angry. I don't stay mad. I stay mad two seconds then I'm over it.  	My mom talks about how Sarah always thinks she's not the one to blame and nothing is her fault when really the truth is everything is. Sarah is a complete...something. I don't know. It's horrible what she does and what's worse is what she doesn't realize. My mom said she was looking into sending her to a Catholic convent but it was too late in the year to enroll. Oh man oh man! That sure would have killed Sarah. Why does it have to be too late???  	I'm sick of Sarah's shit and that's all I have to say about that!
