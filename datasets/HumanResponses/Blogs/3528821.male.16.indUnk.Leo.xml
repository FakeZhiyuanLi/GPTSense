      Today was pretty boring.  I half-heartedly attempted to study for chemistry.  In retrospect, I really havent reviewed anthing of value.  oh well.  Hopefully it is easy tommorrow.  After a long day of sitting around and doing nothing i went over my dads and we had a wiffleball game.  We were in the 5th inning, the game was supposed to go four but we tied...and it started to rain.  So we will pick it up probably tommorrow.  I let up two runs and so did he.  I picked up my runs in the fourth to keep me alive.  Lots of fun.  Now as i sit here writing this i realize that i really should be studying.  Im going to go and turn on Scream 2, which is on Fox tonite and attempt to study.  Wish me luck...Ojala que el examen manana este facil!

      This is my first post...how exciting.  It was inspired by Adam and Rachael's so..hopefully it isn't really bad. Well I had to take two finals today.  Geometry, which is a joke...and English.  English should have been easy, but the teacher randomly changed what she expected of us.  We had to write two five paragraph analysis and do multi-choice questions.  I almost didn't finish.  Oh well it is all over now..no big deal.  Geometry was a joke and the teacher..who i am tight with...said i got an A+..so that is good.  Hopefully it will balance out my horrendus grades to come in Spanish and Chemistry.  Well enough about school.  After the finals we had a cookout behind the manor house.  It was a good time.  We had burgers, pizza, cookies, chips, all that good stuff.  Good time.  it was too bad we couldn't stay longer and play wiffle ball or football b/c it started to rain.  Then i went to my dad's work..where he no longer works as of today..which kinda sucks.  But he got a better job.  We saw it coming b/c his company was losing money and they are getting bought out.  We will get over it.  After that i went and played eighteen holes of golden tee.  good time.  Got to love simulated golf, it makes you feel better about your golf game.  I have been playing golf for almost ten years and i am awful.  Well thats all for today, not very eventful.  I have to go to a softball game for BS tonite in Oakham hopefully i dont get shot by a hick....

      The Chemistry final was, in one word..impossible.  There was a rediculous amount of problem solving.  The teacher told us there would be like 10 and there were at least fifty.  At least my friday ended well.  Adam, Chris and I went to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  It was awesome.  Certainly the best HP movie yet.  It was 10x better than the first and 25x better than the second.  It was fun to hang out with my old friends.  Good times...good times... Over the weekend i did absolutely no studying for todays Spanish test.  No biggie.  I pitched about 12 innings of wiffleball.  I was soooo sore this morning.  I did pretty well.  I won one and lost one.  The loss was tough b/c it ended 9-8.  I went to the SJ Improve Show on Saturday night.  It was wicked funny.  Hot Soup (Sarge) was actually good this time, Lefty was great, Rusty, Colin, and the newbie Schwartz.  I am definetly going to join the club next year it looks like so much fun.  I can't wait.  I golfed on Sunday morning, very horribly.  I dont know if i have ever played worse in my recent memory. Today I got to sleep late due to the fact that my final was at 10:30, good stuff.  The final was pretty easy, always a few random questions, but all in all, not bad.  After that I went to Pub 99 for some almuerzo, good fajitas.  Then I had the playoff b-ball game at 4:oo against WACHUSETT.  It was the best game I have seen this year.  We got to experiecne what it feels like to be behind (which had not happened in about 7 games).  It was intense.  We put together a four run 8th inning rally.  It was soo great.  The WACH kids were punks as usual...jeering at Landers and Depasse.  Well how do you feel now punks...ya friggin losers.  Final score 5-2.  All that's in our way to the championship is Milford (there actually good) Wednesday, Holy Cross Field 4:00, be there. T-Law, OUT...

      I haven't had a good life since I last posted.  Saint johns lost I the Division 1 Finals on Saturday night.  That sucked, a lot.  I golfed four times this weekend with a cumulative 45 holes.  I stayed over night at the Relay for Life with a bunch of Saint Johns kids.  Doane and I snuck out to buy some cards and skittles to use as chips.  I lost both times to him, but not too easily.  He is probably the best poker player in the class, and I faired pretty well.  We didn't bet much, all in all I only lost about four dollars.  After that, we had the tournament.  My dad threw a party the night before for someone's birthday.  My three other teammates were wicked hangover.  So we only finished one under par.  We had the ability, if half the team wasn't incapacitated to shoot at least 7 under.  Not so great, then the dreaded baseball game.  We will not speak of that.  Sunday I did nothing, and Monday we drove my dads customer from Washington into Springfield, lots of fun.  Sorry I haven't posted in a while, but who actually reads this anyways?

      I havent updated in a while.  Nothing interesting has happened latley.  Just hanging out around the house until just yesterday when I started Lifegaurding at Sewall Beach.  The pay sucks, but it is such an easy job.  The report card came in, pretty good stuff.  I kind of bombed my English final but I still pulled off a good final average.  Now I'm waiting to go to the Cape with the Sargents and Tim.  It should be fun.  As I said before.  Nothing intersting has happened in my life lately, not too much of a surprise.  Well hopefully it gets a little more interesting so whoever reads this next time (if anyone) doesn't pass out from boredom.

       urlLink     What Color is Your Brain?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      At work or in school : I need to be "hands on": I like to play games, to compete, and to perform. I enjoy flexibility, changes of pace, and variety. I have difficulty with routine and structure. My favorite subjects are music, art, theatre, and crafts. I often excel in sports. I like solving problems in active ways and negotiating for what I want. I can be direct and like immediate results.   With friends : Planning ahead bores me because I never know what I want to do until the moment arrives. I like to excite my friends with new and different things, places to go, and romantic moments.   With family : I need a lot of space and freedom. I want everyone to have fun. It is hard for me to follow rules, and I feel we should all just enjoy one another.

      I just got back this morining from Cape Cod where I have been since Saturday.  I really didn't want to leave because I was having too much fun, but I had to at least work one day this week at the beach.  So I am dissapointed that I am missing out on two solid days of awesomeness.  Life has been easy lately, not too much stress.  I am half way through our first summer reading book, due to the Cape and all.  Yesterday I went deep sea fishing and caught a bunch of bluefish and one striper.  The striper that I caught was too small to keep, but my other friends who went with me caught keepers and we had a great lunch.  Just wanted to update before I went back to the Cape again.  I hope the end of the week will be as fun as the beggining.  And anyone who reads this...you going to Adams party??

      I hope everyone had fun at my party.  I know I did.  I am hoping to have a get together sometime soon, maybe early September.  That way Nicole can come, and Carolyn and Rachael (since she is talking to me now, lets see how long it lasts) can hang out for longer than two hours.  Thanks to Julie and Cait who came, but forgot it was for my birthday (you are forgiven).  Tim and Chris stayed over.  We had a good time: alot of bumperpool, poker, blackjack ect.  Thanks to everyone for coming; I had fun.  Nothing interesting has happened as of yet today.  I am in Boston celebrating my cousins baptism.  This event is kind of overshadwing my birthday, but whatever I am used to being secondbest.  Now I am going to go wallow in my self pity. On another note, I hope you have a better rest of the day Adam.

      My birthday is right around the corner.  I'm one of the last ones of all my friends, if not the last, to get my permit.  It is about time.  It may not seem like much, but I'm pretty happy to be finally able to drive (legally).  Nothing real exciting happened today.  I got some new dress shoes for school, a tie rack, and a new shirt and tie.  (ya I know real exciting).  But thats my life.  I dont have a lot to talk about today.  Hopefully I have a good B-day.

      I know it probably had to be done. But I'm still in a state of mourning. Nomar was born to play in Boston. He rose through the ranks to become an All-Star and batting champion. Who knows, maybe he will end up back with us. I think we could have gotten better players for him. But what do I know. It's just sad. He was most everyone's favorite player. He will be sorely missed. I'll leave you with this: We lost the Babe, Clemens, Ekersly (sorry about the spelling, recently inducted into Hall of Fame), Schilling (won Cy Youngs while he was gone), Tony Clark (he was awful with us), and more than I care to name. Quote me on this " This trade will come back to bite us in the ass!"

      It has been a long time since I updated. I have been doing so much. I was at the Cape again and had to go to Summer School (don't ask...Its not b/c I'm dumb, Im just a tool). I had class three nights a week. Three weeks ago I went to the Cape with my cousin's for a 1/2 a week. It was a ton of fun. We went to the beach alot and played wiffleball. Good times. The only downside was the ominous cloud of summer pre-calc. After the Cape I went to...  Scout Camp.....  yeah. Ok so im still a Boy Scout, but I can't stop now because I'm almost Eagle. Chris and I had a good time. Rach showed up, but didn't talk to us. It was weird. We have been friends for so long, but her family was around her and we felt awkward approaching her. Oh well its not like she ever talks to me anyway. We threw ourselves a party on Friday night.....thanks to me and Chris's older bother Ryan.    After camp I had one more week of summer school. I worked at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday, and met President Bill Clinton. He was doing a book signing and I got to have my book signed. It was pretty exciting. The Pre-calc final was last Thursday and it was just okay. Not too hard, but shady. I find out how I did probably on my birthday. What a present. I can only get ten wrong to get into BC Calc, hopefully I did okay. I got my AP European History results (5). Most of my friends did well too. With all this school and work shit I haven't had time to do summer reading. I have four books, and I will never finish in time. So far I have only finished Religion. I saved the hard ones for last, great idea.      I have been lifegaurding for over a month and a half. I have realized that I really hate the job. The pay sucks, I have to watch a pond, I have to drive all the way to Bolyston, the hours suck, and the hot girl that lifeguards there doesn't work when I do. I always get the shaft...  Does anyone really care though...No....No one reads this!!!!!  I had to go all the way to Princeton, NJ this Friday for a wedding. It was a long ride. It was worth it though, b/c Princeton University was right across the street. It was a wicked nice campus. There school colors are orange and black, which is definitely a sign. (Orange is my favorite color, don't you know). If I don't screw myself over junior year, I might be able to get in. !Ojala! I went to Chris's house yesterday, it was a good time. We played wiffleball, went swimming, talked to rach online. Its weird how you can easily talk to someone online, but not in person (Rach just hates us, or maybe just me). Oh well.  Well my birthday is this week, I finally can get my permit. My party is this Friday. If your cool you will know about it. Sorry I haven't updated, (who am I saying sorry to, no one reads this!!!! ahhhhhhhhhh)  Except Rach, b/c I just looked at my Blog and she is the only one nice enough to read it.  Sorry I havent been talking nice about you in this post rach.  You are a good friend, sorry.

      I went back to work today after my birthday four day vacation. It was just alright. Nothing too exciting happened. Tim stayed over last night after his brothers party. We held a party for him because he is leaving at the end of the month to become a Jesuit. It was an okay party, but it sucked at the beginning because Tim was still working at the pool. He didn't get there until five so I needed a way to keep myself busy, and I really didn't find one besides watching tennis, which I love to do. I am really tired because I have been up late every night since Thursday. Every night people have stayed over except Saturday (and I just had to stay up until the end of SNL weekend update). Nothing else to say so I wont bore you with my rambling...
