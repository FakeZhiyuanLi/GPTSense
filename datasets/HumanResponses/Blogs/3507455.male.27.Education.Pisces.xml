      Is this really any different? Besides, we don't get the fun little icons of how we're feeling. I feel like a smiley face drinking a fruity blender drink. I love the day off, I have never smelled so much lighter fluid in my life. I feel like I must eat grilled meat today. yet I have no grill.   Jobs are a tricky thing. I'm scared to start a new job, but I know I must, and that requires obtaining a new job. So I must make a new resume and write letters. I hate this whole process. I want the big texan in the white hat to come and say "Hey there, tall drink of water, want a lucrative job where you do very little and get paid a lot? I'll relocate you to a non-dying area and you'll be swamped with money and broads!"   And I'd say "Boards? Why do I need boards?"  And he'd say, "No, broads."  And I'd say, "I'd rather have mamasitas thank you very much, especially if I'm going to Texas."  and he'd look all stern and then smile and go,"Well, that's settled. See ya Monday!"     THAT'S how I should get a job!

      Our upcoming show "Godzillas and Generals" is turning out to be a very good show!  We are trying alot of different things with this show, and you really are going to want to check it out.    One thing we are doing a little differently is reverting to our classic format for shows.  What I mean is that we aren't trying to tell a large, hour long story with this show.  Rather, we are doing things the old way, where we have penned a bevy of hilarious sketches, seemingly unrelated to each other.  Of course, because we are geniuses, and have a lot of dumb luck, things still tie together wonderfully at the end.  There are a handful of shows that I think are the "Best" the Dwellers have ever done.  In that list are Decon Santa, Kiwanis, and some of the older ones that we did during that golden summer.  I don't quite remember the year of that summer, but the show that sticks out in my mind is the show in which we had the most guns in a Dweller show... ever.  There were something like twelve guns on stage at one time!  And yet, throughout the show, only one character died and that was of natural causes.  It was a wonderful show, where all of the skits were written independently but in the end, thanks to being at the right place at the right time, we were able to pretty much tie together every skit.  It was beautiful.  And so this show is taking an interesting course.  We have chosen a theme instead of a plot.  That theme is "Japanese Pop Culture."  It all came about when Larry and Joe came up with an idea for a skit (I won't give away what that skit was), and when they told everyone about it, I totally dug the idea of making the whole show sort of themed around the crazy Japanese culture (what with their samurais, ninjas, monsters, food, and videogames).  Originally trying to make the show like we had done Kiwanis and Decon, we tried to come up with this elaborate plot involving a samurai sword (and whomever had the sword became a samurai).  We realized this idea was tired, and not as interested as first imagined... and so we set out and worked on some ideas, wrote some skits, and did some improv... and the end result is "Godzillas and Generals"  And while the show isn't completely about Japanese culture, we managed to get some funny skits involving Godzilla, samurais, ninjas and a special surprise.  Along with these themed skits, we also have some great satirical sketches and a special "guest character" from everyone's favorite rock group: Blue Oyster Cult!  Enough of me giving away info about our show... You are just going to have to check it out.  Of course, it was brought to me attention the other day, while enjoying some coffee at Cafe Kolache, that our opening show is on the same night as the new Harry Potter movie.  While most other sketch comedy and improv troupes would be frightened by this, the Cellar Dwellers do not waver.  We don't even flinch.. we will fight Harry Potter, just as we have in the past, with our humor!  I think we can pull in more people than that puberty-breaching, girl-clamoring kiddie fest.  Of course, if the Dwellers are going to try and pull in over 100 million in our first weekend, we are going to need your help.    Friday, June 4th at the CCBC Allied Health Auditorium.  (CCBC stands for Community College of Beaver County, for those of you not from the area).  The show begins at 8:00pm and will run until around 10.  Tickets are just $5.00 and reservations can be made in advance by e-mailing the Dwellers: reservations@thecellardwellers.com  or checking out our website.    If you can't make it this Friday, due to work (NOT due to Harry Potter... which, I assure you, is no excuse) then you have one more chance to check out this hilarious sketch show next Saturday, June 12th also at the CCBC auditorium.  It starts at 8:00 and tickets are also $5.  But if you bring your Harry Potter ticket stub, we can charge you $7.50 instead... it's only fair.  And so, hope to see you there!  Feel free to comment and ask questions about the show... or just come find out for yourself next Friday.  The Dwellers love you.

      As I've noted in past postings, I find myself in almost constant transport from my home and Beaver County, home of the Cellar Dwellers. As I also have mentioned, traveling can lead to all sorts of adventures. Such was the case last Saturday.  I had left the triumphant improv show at the Copper dog - 4 paying customers, woohoo. It was fairly late, almost 12:30 am as I piloted my '93 Lumina - or 'The Silver Bullet' as I like to call it - through Rochester.  I was almost out of Rochester when I looked in my rear view mirror and saw the one sight sure to invoke terror in the mind of all motorist. I was being chased by Dan Akroyd. Just checking to see if you're paying attention. What my mirror really revealed was the flashing lights of a police officer.  Is there any more nerve racking event than being pulled over by the cops? Well, yes I guess there is. Trench warfare comes to mind. Still, getting pulled over always manages to be a good sucker punch experience. One minute you're driving along quite happily, feeling free. The next minute some guy with a mustache - they always have mustaches - is shining a flashlight in your face.  I tried to play it cool. I made a concerted effort to have all my paper work ready for the officer which was a fools errand. My glove box explodes like a party favor when opened. Papers fly everywhere. Every piece of paper work I have ever received for my car is in there. I have registrations dating back to the mid 70's. I don't know what car they belong to, but they're there. I was able to find my current registration. It was rolled in a ball under an ancient half full bag of Skittles.   I greeted the officer kindly, "Hello officer. How are you tonight. Beautiful night for a drive isn't it." I practically had to muzzle myself before I became just a little too friendly. I was half a step from saying: "Say officer, has anyone ever told you your an attractive man? You must work out." Remember, when talking to the police there is a fine line between polite and catching-a-beat-down-with-a-flashlight polite.  "You know I clocked going 50 back there," The officer said. "You were also a little erratic. You went over the double yellow and the white lines."  Crap, I thought to myself, looks like its alphabet backward time for James. But I'm sober. At least I think I'm sober. I only had 1-1.5 beers at Copper Dog. That was a couple hours ago. I couldn't be drunk. But what if they were super beers? What the hell's a super beer?  I remained quiet and tried my best too look sober, which I was. I offered him my license and registration. Always be helpful to the police when they pull you over. If you have food in the car offer it to them. "Oh," the officer said, "I also need your insurance card."  (flashback a couple of days:  my mother: James, your insurance card came in the mail. me: Just leave it there. I'll get it.)  I didn't have my insurance card, the fine for - the officer tells me - is a 6 month suspension of your driver's license. I panic. I tell the officer I have it. I show him the most recent card freshly expired. He seems to understand. I can't tell. He's got a flashlight in my face.  "Where are you coming from?"  "The Copper Dog." I think it best not to lie. I was at a bar.  "Doing a little drinking were you?"  "Just one or two a couple hours ago. I was doing a show. I'm an actor."  "What kind of show?"  "Improv comedy. I'm a member of the Cellar Dwellers. Check out our website www.thecellardwellers.com" Did I just plug the Cellar Dwellers? Was that a good idea? The officer seemed to accept it. It was the truth.  Then, the officer went back to his cruiser.   Now, I have no idea what cops do when they take your paper work back into their car, but I have a sneaking suspicion it's nothing. They're just making you sweat. They're probably back there smoking a cigarette or brewing some coffee or shaving or playing the harmonica or doing any number of other inane pursuits while your left pondering your fate. I was sweating bullets. I needed my license. I can't afford to pay for a ticket. The ticket could be worth more than I am right now. I'd have to sell plasma just to make ends meet.  Eventually, the officer returns and a miracle happens. I swear it was a miracle. Little things like this confirm my belief in a loving God. The officer uttered those sweet, sweet little words: "I'm going to let you off with a warning." Praise God, hallelujah. I feel like singing. I feel like dancing. I want to hug the officer. I don't. It probably wouldn't have been the wisest of choices. I restrain myself. I do thank the officer and wish him a pleasant night. And then, just like that, I am free. I drive away with joy in my heart and less lead in my foot.  Shalom

      I was just about to spend another day bored out of my mind.  I had spent the morning doing some designing, graphically of course, and had just left to visit my local Sheetz.  When I got back home, Danny and I sat down with my dad to watch some Fox News over lunch.  But wait... what's this?  Breaking news?  It's a CAR CHASE!  The saving grace of any afternoon: a high speed car chase somewhere in California.  Even better, it was a bank robbery and they were soaring on some freeway throwing money out of the window!    All three of us stopped and watched the screen.  Danny started clapping in excitement.  I tell ya, there is nothing that cheers me up more than some hella-sweet action that could wind up in disaster.  This chase scene, which at first brought back fond memories of the O.J. chase, was going to be a good one too.  There were three robbers speeding around in what appeared to be a Chrysler Pacifica, with about five cop cars following suit.  What's even better is they were catching everything from helicopter cam!    The driver of this car was pretty crazy at times.  He was all over the 8 lane super highway, and then he would take an exit and head into the urban areas of LA, including Compton (represent!), and then would loop around and get back on the freeway going in the other direction.  Even better, he utilized the car pool lane!  Not only was that smart, but it was also considerate, since he did have more than two passengers.  After about fifteen minutes of driving all over LA, and after evading the police which weren't very smart, they wound up in this suburban area.  The robbers pulled the car onto some lady's lawn and pulled this weird Chinese fire drill.  The woman, who was a large African American, was standing on the corner screaming at the robbers... and then screaming at the cops... and then screaming at everything.    Two of the robbers gave up instantly.  But the driver, who was a pretty hefty fellow wearing some O.G. football jersey, ran inside the house.  There was a standoff for a little while, which was especially hilarious because this crazy woman was standing between the cops and the house, getting into the way of their pointed guns.  Eventually the woman, whom I can only assume to be the driver's mother, talked the robber into coming out of the house and giving up.    Although I must say, judging from what I saw of the robbers... they didn't plan this well at all.  They were all wearing normal street clothes, no suits or black ties, and none of them had masks.  They obviously didn't have a good safe house, and obviously didn't have enough man power.  If more robbers would just do their research and watch some movies they might get away with it once in a while.  But anyways...  What excitement!  I tell ya, great car chases only happen every once in a while,  much like comets or the Olympics.  And just like the previously mentioned events, car chases are not to be missed.  My day has been brightened because of these ridiculous robbers and their poor planning.  Thank you, young vigilantes.  Thank you!

      I had been aware for several weeks that my car was badly in need of two new tires. However, being unemployed and horribly destitute - funny how the two seem to go together - I was forced to drive the car as is. It wasn't too bad. There was a slight thrill to every car trip. I never knew when the tires would blow, possibly sending my car out of control. It's these little things which keep my life interesting. Today, thanks to a monetary donation to the Keep James Afloat Fund from my Aunt, I finally was able to buy new tires. Of course, I went to the cheapest place I could think of, Wal-Mart Supercenter. (Just let me say right now that I don't want any 'How could you support the evil, unfeeling, corporate behemoth' comments. Maybe I'll fight injustice when I get the cash - maybe - and right now Wal-Mart's being quite helpful in keeping cash in my pocket. Long live the free market.)  Upon arriving at the Wal-Mart Supercenter in lovely bucolic cranberry Pennsylvania. I was informed that it would take a little over an hour for them to get to and do the work on my car. So, I had little choice but to find a way to while away the time at Wal-Mart, there being nothing else within walking distance. This presented many problems, the chief of which being Malaise. I mean malaise in every sense of the word from boredom to the more existential sense of loss and dislocation. Wal-Mart is like a factory for these feelings, especially when I am alone there. Just looking at the people in Wal-Mart makes me feel more and more distant from my fellow man. How can I have anything in common with someone in a Dale Earnhardt jacket? How can I entertain myself for an entire hour?  I could feel it. The malaise stalking through the aisles - a black cloud ready to envelope me. I had to keep my wits about me, stay sharp. I'm not ready to embrace my malaise. I don't care to become authentic whatever that means. I read it somewhere.  I sat in the tire center waiting room for maybe 2 minutes. Just long enough to drink a cup of complimentary coffee. The waiting room was truly depressing: Colorless walls, torn vinyl chairs, 6 month old issues of better homes and gardens. One other guy was in there talking business on his cell phone. I secretly hoped he would make an inappropriate personal phone call, get in a fight with his wife or something. That would've entertained the sick part of me. But he only talked about tractor prices. I left the waiting room. The man never noted my entrance or exit.  So, I was left adrift in the consumer wasteland. I moved quickly, one aisle to the next section to section, leaving whenever I felt the first shiver of boredom or despair. I took my blood pressure. It was good. I was proud of myself for a minute as I look over the deodorant for no good reason. I played with the camcorders aiming the one attached to the TV up my nose for all walking by to enjoy.  I leafed through the latest copy of People. They listed the 50 most eligible bachelors. Some how I managed not to make the list again this year. They must not know I'm single. The guys starring in the upcoming film 'Harold And Kumar Go to White Castle' made the list, so I have my suspicions as to the viability of said list.  I made a game out of taking the bouncy balls out of the bin and throwing them back into the top. I would throw them from all angles, from behind obstacles. I even tried it from an aisle over. I almost got thrown out from that.  I browsed the hunting rifles, asking the clerk questions like "Do you have anything that will make a deer's head explode?" or "Do you have anything for a guy trying to compensate for something, if you know what I mean?" I almost got thrown out for that.  I looked at the toys. I wished they had some out so I could give them a try but they didn't. So, I opened a bag of marbles anyway.  I tried to pick up games with some kids until their parents pulled them away. I almost got thrown out for that.  I pulled a bike off the rack to give it a test ride. I almost got thrown out for that.  I climbed up on a display section to try out some of the exercise equipment. I almost got thrown out for that.  I unfolded a camping chair and rolled out a cooler next to it. Then I chose a fishing pole from sporting goods and a goofy hat from the Men's section. I spent a good five minutes pretending to drink beer and fish. I almost got thrown out for that.   Almost getting thrown out ended up being the key to my morning. Walking that fine line between harmless fun and public nuisance proved quite rewarding. Testing the limits of acceptable behavior at Wal-Mart, I think someone could write a thesis on this. It gave my morning just enough of an edge to ward off malaise. In the end, I got two new tires, at least 6 warnings, and no existential crisis. Sounds like a good morning to me.   Shalom

      If you have ever played a videogame that deals with war or fighting against a bunch of guys, you may know of a little feature called "Fog of War."  Basically this is a thick fog that appears, limiting your view to only a close proximity to yourself.  It's based off of the actual term "fog of war" which is used to describe the thick fog of soot and gunpowder that fills the air after an intense battle.  In videogames, it's used so you don't watch every move the enemy makes, hence creating a little surprise and challenge.  I was thinking about this odd concept the other day, and I was wondering what would happen if everyone had "fog of war" in real life.  No matter what time of day it is, no matter how good your glasses are, you can only see four feet in any one direction.  Everything else just looks like a gray haze.  Driving would be insane.  I'm sure I would run over all sorts of animals, people, and rubber sports equipment that happens to wander in front of my Cougar.  Parking would also be quite the bear, as my keen "empty-spot-spotting eye" would be totally useless.  As would my  "hidden police officer spotting eye."  That's two eyes that are gone with the wind!  Then again, losing the cops would be a little easier (although I'm sure their range of sight would be a little longer than mine... law enforcement bonus).    Walking around the mall would be a tad more enjoyable, since I wouldn't have to try as hard to avoid people I don't like.  I only really have to panic when they get within a few feet of me.  Muggers and Jehovah's Witnesses would be harder spot and defend against, on the other hand.    But if you are going to go the way of these videogames (the ones I have in mind are Age of Empires and Dynasty Warriors) then you could also employ some scouts.  Get the shmuck on a horse to go ahead and see if they have any ripe bananas at Giant Eagle.  He will come back with the word, or he would even distract the Jehovah's long enough for me to run in there and get the delicious yellow fruits.  Now that I think about it a bit, I'm glad that God turned off "fog of war" in the options menu  when he was creating the world...  well, you can probably see that my summer has been pretty boring thus far.  I've got nothing better to do than think about videogames and watch MacGyver (who is freaking awesome, by the way.)

      I just got back from New York. That's right, the Big Apple, media capital of the world, center for culture, the city that never sleeps. At least that's what I've been told. I spent almost all my time at my grandparents house in the suburbs, and trust me, my grandparents house definitely DOES sleep. I would even go as far as saying it slumbers. It's half a step away from slipping into a coma. Bed time's 8:30 and it's strictly enforced.  So, it's safe to say that I didn't exactly experience the thrill of New York City, despite being a mere stone's throw away. I missed the rush of the subway, the rhythm of the streets, the smell of the cabbies, but I wouldn't classify the trip as a loss. I learned all sorts of valuable things. Such as, it doesn't matter if you lose a ton of weight and everyone else thinks you look fantastic, an Italian grandmother will think you look awful. Apparently, despite being a healthy weight for my height, I'm dangerously thin. My grandmother kept looking at me as though I were a cancer patient. She would lurk in shadows waiting to pounce on me, brandishing a meatball sub like a shining sword of justice ready to plunge it into my unsuspecting mouth. I couldn't let my guard down for a second. I'd wake in the morning with inexplicable marinara on my chin and the taste of garlic on my tongue.   I also came to the realization that I can no longer really talk to my grandparents, I can only talk around them. It's not that there's some horrible generation gap separating us. My grandparents simply can't hear anymore. I'm sure that over the course of a full week they only understood maybe 20 percent of what I said. I know they have a horribly inaccurate idea of what my life is like. I just got tired of correcting them. There's only so many times I can repeat something and there's only so loud I can talk. I just let them think what they like. It's easier on all of us. Here's an actual exchange:  Grandma: So, you do plays? Me: Well, actually it's sketch comedy. G: What? M: Sketch comedy? G: What? M: SKETCH COMEDY! Like Saturday Night Live. G: You perform on Saturday? M: Yeah, whatever. (I nod emphatically in surrender) G: What part do you play? M: I play a lot of parts? G: What? M: MANY PARTS!! G: What? M: An officer in the Queens Navy. G: Oh, a barber, how nice.  As if that wasn't bad enough, I had to put up with the most deafeningly loud television in the free world. My grandfather sits 4 feet from the television with what's left of his hair flapping to the decibels. And he still couldn't make half the stuff out. I couldn't escape the noise of the television. If you ever want to know what Bill O'Reilly is talking about all you need to do is be within a quarter mile radius of my grandparent's house. You can't miss it. Eighties rock band Scorpions could be playing a concert in the back yard and I would never know.  So, while I missed out on the traditional New York experience. I feel that I got something much more important. I got a crash course on why I only visit my family once a year, and how much it sucks growing old.  Shalom

      The other night I was sitting in my house and thinking about cartoons. For some reason the Smurfs popped in my head. Did you know they are from Belgium, like French Fries and those good waffles? Well, they are. In fact many well known cartoons are from there, the other popular one in the states was Tin Tin. You can get Smurf comics there in Flemish or Dutch. It's pretty cool.   Anyways, I got to thinking about the smurfs. And I knew that the smart one that made stuff was Handy Smurf, but I recalled one that wore glassesm which is of course the international sign for smarts. But I knew it wasn't Handy, who wore a pencil behind the ear.   So, I knew I could turn to the source of all information useless: the internet. I had faith in the fact that some person with nothing better to do had created a website that listed, with pictures, all of the smurfs. So I used google and put in Smurf List, and sure enough, there was such a list, and sublists under it. I quickly found that Brainy smurf was the one of which I was thinking. Glasses and a snooty attitude, like an associate professor.  So while some may think that the internet is good for school, which it isn't, and some may think it's only good for porn searchs, which it is. I also argue that there is a lot of useless crap out there to be known. And people seem to have webpages for it, and they pay for them and keep them updated. What sad and isolated lives we Americans lead. we can now talk instantly to people across the globe, but we won't leave the house and talk to the person next door.   Speaking of which, I have got to get outside. It's gorgeous! Right after I find some porn. Hahha  Kickin' it, father's day style, Mike the Tall

      While some of my readers, I know, are going to cringe in disgust, I figured I would throw this out there and see if anyone's interested.  I am throwing a Part for the President in July, and anyone who reads this is invited!     urlLink You may remember last April when I went to a Bush/Cheney Party in Greensburg.   Well I had so much fun that I decided I wanted to throw my own party this July.  There is a national party for the president day on Thursday, July 15th, and anyone involved will get a sweet conference call with VP Dick Cheney himself!  It's a sweet deal.    The reason I wanted to throw one, was basically because of what I witnessed at the first party I went to.  It was a fine party, very respectable, but it was definitely geared towards adults.  Me, Leroy and Teddy were the youngest guys there.  So I figured why not have a party aimed at younger folks, college kids and folks in their twenties.  A real "party" filled with loud music (Andrew W. K., not Toby Keith), a light atmosphere with some real humor and good times.  Instead of having it at a fancy hotel, I'm having it at a brand new coffee house in Rochester, PA.  Instead of hiring a DJ to play stereotypical Republican country music, I'm bringing my Mac and playing some true party music (regardless of affiliation).  (Assuming all goes to plan) We are going to have a conference call from the vice prez, a video tape from the president, and some other sweet activities and speeches.    This isn't to say that only republicans are invited.  If you are someone who isn't registered, and wants to learn more about the Grand Old Party (and you are smart enough to know that there is more to us than what the news and Michael Moore portray) then come on down and give it a shot.  Or if you are a democrat who wants to see what's going on, perhaps you aren't brainwashed by the MTV-culture into hating GW, or you just want to have some lively discussion, then check it out.    The GO-Party for the President is on Thursday, July 15th from 6:30pm until 9:30pm at the Blue Violet Cafe (Brighton Ave, Rochester PA).  For more information, post a comment!

      In these turbulent times it is important that we all remember one simple immutable truth: celebrities are better than us. They are superior to us simple folk in every conceivable way. They are better looking. They are richer. They live in unnecessary, palatial 'cribs'. They are sweeter smelling. They have entire television shows devoted to their fabulous lives. They are more well spoken. They are more intelligent. And, this must be remembered at all times above all else, their opinions are worth more than the those of the rest of us slack jawed, hamburger helper eating yokels.  So, in these fractured, contentious times let us all turn to the great oracle of Hollywood to gain guidance and understanding. They will tell us everything we will ever need to know, from what to wear to who to vote for. They will do all the thinking for the poor 'little people' of our nation. This is a good thing since regular people have such a hard time thinking. We'd all be much happier not thinking at all. After all, thinking gives regular people headaches, and we always make such a mess of ideas. Left to our devices we might do totally illogical things, like read books, express ourselves, or even vote for whoever we want. What a nightmare. Thank you Hollywood for sweet, sweet mind-numbing television to give celebrities a forum to tell us useless worms how the world works.  Now, I don't want to hear any complaints. That's just the last vestiges of your independent, but fatally flawed thought talking. Just let it slip away. Don't question celebrities. They're right. They have to be. They're celebrities. I know to us, the great unwashed masses, it may seem odd that we value someone's opinion simply because they happen to be famous and they happen to be famous simply because they are attractive, or can read someone else's words on cue, or because they have a pleasant voice. But it simply doesn't matter why someone's famous. As long as someone is famous they become our moral and intellectual superiors. That's just the way the world works. It's God's plan. Celebrities are the center of our world. We should all just recognize this and genuflect. Now, if you'll excuse me. I have to watch E!.  Shalom

      I don't know why I keep telling people this, because I'm certainly not proud of it... but I saw the movie "Soul Plane."  Yeah, I know... I know.  It was a dumb thing to do, but the circumstances under which I saw the film made sense at the time (although they are certainly no excuse).  I had a bevy of free tickets for the Destinta theater out in Bridgeville, and they expired last week, so I had to go and use them up... I mainly saw movies that I had already seen, like "The Punisher" and "Shrek 2" and then, in a move that I can only attribute to a moment of weakness, poor timing, peer pressure, and desperation, I saw "Soul Plane."  So far, I've gotten the same reaction from everyone I've admitted this to: "Oh God, what were you thinking?!"  And the answer is "I have no clue."  The whole movie looked more like a train wreck from a mile away.  Have you seen the trailer?  It looked absolutely terrible... and I assure you, if you make the same mistake I did and actually take the time to watch the movie, your guess about the movie will be proven.  It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  And while I could sit here and critique this movie like I would any film, wasting time on the technical flaws of the movie would be pointless.  Just thinking about the content of this film would make anyone, of any race, just shake their heads.  In what had the potential to be the "soulful" version of the comedy classic "Airplane!", "Soul Plane" is nothing more than a 90 minute MTV-stereotyped, racially-charged, mess of a film that makes me wish I had the comforting arm of TV's George Lopez to cry on... that's pretty bad.  Let me start by talking about what goes on in the movie.  There is this giant purple plane with hydraulics (which is probably one of the few cool aspects of the movie) and it's flying with a bunch of stereotypes... and Tom Arnold.  I don't understand how any race could NOT be offended by this movie.  There is one Arab on the plane, and of course there are a few 9-11 jokes to go along with him.  There are four white people on the plane, they have the last name of "Honkey" and they are coming home from a vacation to "Crackerland."  Come on now... and then of course the plane is filled with African Americans.  And for once I agree with Spike Lee and his joints-a-plenty.  This movie is most offensive towards blacks!  Sure there were a few times throughout the movie that I chuckled at what was going on on screen.  Perhaps it is just the overall faux pas nature of this racist piece of cinema (the lower class section of the plane gets a piece of Popeye's fried chicken for their in-flight meal), afterwards I felt a little weird about the whole movie.  What kind of audience are they making this for?    Well I can tell you.  It was made for the pop-culture-loving teens of this day and age.  And they are eating it up.  There is a reason why this awful movie is number 5 across the nation.  It's the same reason that they are making a movie called "Harold and Kumar go to White Castle" and a movie called "The Cook Out."  Because America loves dumb shit.  America loves stereotypes and humor that, when attached using electrodes to a bowl of green Jello, barely causes ripples.  Now I saw this movie because I had a free ticket, and so technically they didn't make any money off of me and my buddies.  But someone out there is seeing this movie, and it's not good for America or Hollywood (who is going to do nothing but continue to make this kind of crap).    So if anyone asks... I saw Soul Plane to further my knowledge of cultural studies.  And because I had a free ticket.

      There is something to be said for the Cellar Dwellers' marketing and advertising practices.  Perhaps those words would be "gorilla tactics" or "grassroots effort" or maybe even "word of mouth."  And then there is something to be said for the Beaver County Times' treatment of the Cellar Dwellers' effort.  Unfortunately, those words are a little too inappropriate for me to type on this very blog.    Anyone who lives in Beaver County knows the Times' reputation for poor reporting, a strong reliance on AP news stories, a strong liberal slant, and a lot of typos.  You don't need me to complain about that.  And that's not to say that they don't have good people working for them.  Dave Smith is an exemplary entertainment writer, and at one point in time they had John Dessler, one of my inspirations for choosing graphic design.  However, they have managed to give the Cellar Dwellers the good ol' one, two, screw at some point for almost every one of our shows for the past few months.  It's at the point now, where I recommend that our fans NOT look for our shows in there because the listing is going to be wrong regardless.  Two weeks ago, we were doing an all-improv show at Thursdays Restaurant in Bridgewater.  I am the guy in charge of making the fliers, press releases, and other promotional material for the group.  I always make sure the press releases are perfect, and that there is no way to confuse our location, show dates or times.  And yet, somehow the BCT thought we were at Dockers doing improv.  We've never, in our troupe's seven year history, done a show at Dockers.  But I guess that's better than nothing.  Sometimes they just don't print a press release I send them, even when it's on time.  And of course I call them and let them know they are wrong every chance I get.  And yet, there isn't too much we can do, since it's a free service they, and all newspapers, provide.  We just have to take what we can get.    It was their screw-up today that has sent me over the edge.  Learning that they can barely understand press releases printed clearly in either Courier New or Times New Roman, I faxed them the Godzillas and Generals release TWICE, both times well before the deadline for this weekend's issue.  And yet somehow, through some mysterious voodoo curse or insistence on using "copy & paste" methods, they have managed to screw the Cellar Dwellers yet again.  Because fresh in today's Weekender, under the comedy section (I also insist on us being placed in the Theater Section but comedy is fine too... as long as we don't wind up under Etc.), it clearly says that our show is SATURDAY, aka TOMORROW.  It also says that it's scene-based improv.  I just have one web-jargon abbreviation to use right now: WTF.  Apparently, the BCT's A.D.H.D. has gotten the best of them again, and they just make these insane mistakes without even knowing it.    The Beaver County Times has a responsibility to their readers, advertisers, and the Arts in Beaver County to get these listings correct the first time around.  No amount of "corrections" the day after will fill the seats.  And for the Dwellers, the BCT is the best way for us to really get the word out about our shows.  This isn't to say that you should totally ignore what they print, because 70% of the time its probably right.  But I insist that if you see a Dweller listing, you check out the website, or look for a flier, or just go and find out.  Our fliers and website are always correct.  If you want something done right, you do it yourself.  But it's apparent that when you have to rely on others, you only get what you want when you are a paying customer.  I guess they won't get it right until we finally make the cover of the weekender.  Of course, as long as there are Emmy award nominations, we don't stand a chance.  Seeya tonight at the show.

      As some of you may know, I spend quite a bit of time shuttling between my home in lovely Clintonville, PA - up in Venango county - and the Cellar Dweller home base in picturesque Beaver County. In my travels I have encountered myriad wondrous and astounding things, bad weather, scary hitch hikers, an Elvis impersonator truck driver, but I have encountered only one object which completely mystifies me.  Off of route 488, somewhere between Elwood City and Portersville, there stands a statue, maybe four foot tall, of a little Mexican leading a donkey. Alone in a small clearing, with absolutely no explanation, this Mexican is forever caught in the act of leading his donkey toward God-only-knows where. It's almost as though, this Mexican along with his donkey had sprung forth from the Earth whole. It stands there implacable, as mysterious as Stonehenge, as terrifying as an Easter Island head. I have the strangest sensation that no human mind or hand played any part in its construction. This statue exist on a plane beyond human comprehension. At least it exist beyond my own comprehension, which is - I am forced to admit - quite limited.  I do have my theories. I have several, they bubble up from the percolator of my mind. I think that some ancient culture of Lawrence County could have used this statue as a calendar or possibly it held some astrological purpose. It could have fallen from space, like David Bowie did in the 70's. It could be a gift to us from the mole people who live thousands of feet beneath the Earth. My favorite explanation is that it is an idol from a long dead religion - the Valdezians. The Valdezians worshipped all things coffee - mugs, plastic stirrers, half and half, pretentious bastards at Starbucks - and this is an idol to their chief god - Juan Valdez, the bringer of the coffee. Sure I have no proof of this, but I think if I just believe in it enough it just might become so.  One of these days - when I am not driving home at some obscene time of night or running late - I will stop my car and take a closer look at this marvel of ancient engineering. If I ever have anyone else with me and a camera handy I'll take a picture with it. I'd like one with me riding the donkey in my fancy Cellar Dweller T-shirt. I just hope that I don't upset Valdez. He is a jealous god and will not stand for mocking. He can make my coffee taste horrible for the rest of my life.  Shalom

      For the past month or so, Christoph and I have been meeting once or twice a week at Cafe Kolache in Beaver to work on the website.  Kolache is an amazing little coffee house, something I have been clamoring for for years here in the BC.  As I have mentioned, we are "hard" at work on the new site, which is going to be all in Flash.  It's pretty sexy, if I do say so myself.  Chris went out and got all of these books and whatnot and took this sucker on.    Of course, the two of us (along with any other Dweller who may join us) sitting in a cafe with Chris' 17-inch HP laptop aren't the most productive around.  But productivity with this website isn't always our number one priority, fun is.  Because if fun ain't being had, then why be had at all.  That's what I say... sometimes.  And so we sit there, me drawing little designs and pictures in my sketch pad, him clicking away at Action Scripts and Motion Guides, and the two of us talking about the finer things in life: politics, computers, girls, coffee, jobs, and The Tick.  All things relevant to the life of two single working-guys fresh outta high school.    My coffee intake has nearly doubled thanks to working on this website.  The advantage, and the main reason, of doing most of the work at the cafe is because we get a bottomless cup of coffee.  So our laps are scalded by the end of the day.  No, so we get all of the coffee we can muster!  Trust me, I drink alot of coffee.  Usually it's the dark roast (which can be anything from Kenyan, Columbian, and Cuban to J.P. Hearty, AA Kenyan, or M.C. Hammer... I wish there was an M.C. Hammer coffee) with a ton of half and half and sugar.  Chris likes to get a carmel coffee thing (some of the girls there make it with whipped cream, while others skimp on the extras and just give him the coffee) and then he chases that down with some of the normal coffees.  I usually go to the bathroom like three times while we are there (which is normally from 3:30 until they close at 5:30).    It would help alot more if that place had a wireless internet connection like the Copper Dog does.  I mean, it's not enough that we steal their electricity by plugging the laptop into their wall, we want them to pay for internet as well!  There are usually other folks in there with laptops (a good number of them have Apple iBooks... REPRESENT!) and they are all kinda put in their place by Chris' monster computer, which could probably wrestle Deep Blue and Hal at the same time.  Sure those other guys were advanced in their time, but nowadays a centrino Pentium machine could whoop their butts.... sorry.  Anyways, the website is gonna rock harder than Donny Iris' love.  But since he loves us as well, we kinda win on both fronts.

      I was flipping through the channels on the old television - not an all together unusual activity - when I chanced upon something interesting on C-SPAN. (Yes, I am&nbsp; aware that the words C-SPAN and interesting do not generally appear together in any context, but technically this was C-SPAN2.) They were airing a meeting of a focus group from somewhere in Ohio. (OK, I admit this still doesn't sound interesting, but bare with me.) So, there were about 9 people in a non-descript meeting room of some sort being quizzed by a weasily, condescending focusmeister. (Well, maybe this is only interesting to me, but I'm forging ahead anyway.)   This focusmeister - sorry about the overly technical jargon - was asking all sorts of questions about Bush and Kerry to this rag tag assembly of housewives, retirees, and guys with goatees. This was so fascinating to me because this was a window into the strange and arcane tools used by candidates to gain political office. No doubt, Bush, Kerry, and their people use focus groups such as this to tailor their platforms, speeches, and such. After viewing this focus group, I only have one thing to say about the state of the democratic process in our country: It is totally screwed up.   If Bush and Kerry are listening to people like this, God help us all. These people are complete idiots. They almost all complained that both candidates seem to avoid really confronting the&nbsp;issues, but what do you expect when they hear from focus groups like this is that Bush supporters like him for his 'strength and confidence' while&nbsp;Kerry supporters think he's 'careful and thoughtful'. Why would the candidates deal with the issues, when focus groups are telling them that they're more interested in their images?   Then, there were the questions coming from the focusmeister. There was, of course, the old ' who looks more presidential?' chestnut. The correct answer to this is: who cares? It doesn't matter who looks more presidential. Neither Bush nor Kerry does. One has a face that looks like it's melting. The other's face appears to be constantly sucked toward some midpoint, maybe around his nose. (Curiously enough, if you crossed Bush with Kerry, you'd get one normal looking person.) Plus, it doesn't really matter who looks more presidential. It doesn't even matter who acts more presidential. The only question that matters is who would make the better president. Plus, asking who's more presidential between two candidates is akin to asking which is more tree-like: a pine cone or a buckeye. Both have the capability to be a tree, and once a tree, it becomes de facto tree like. It can be nothing but tree like, since it is, after all, a tree. The candidate who becomes president becomes presidential simply by being president, since by definition he can not be otherwise.   The questions from the focusmeister just kept getting stranger and stranger. At one point he asked, "If John Edwards was a family member what family member would he be and why?" Almost everyone answered Uncle - one guy&nbsp;cryptically answered 'an uncle from the coast' with out giving any explanation. Again, no one gave the correct answer which would be to point out that the question is stupid and not worthy of a serious answer - although, if forced to answer I'd have to say Uncle Joey since Edwards, much like Uncle Joey, is just a little too eager to please.   At about this point my attention began to stray from the focus group on television. I began to wonder why the focusmeister didn't just go whole hog and continue asking more and more bizarre questions. It would&nbsp;make for&nbsp;better television and be just as useful to society to just screw with the people, just ask off the wall crap, dare someone to call you on the questions. As a matter of fact, I have a list of questions I would just love to ask a focus group. Here's just a few:   If Dick Cheney were a candy bar, what kind would he be and why? - Hopefully this question would lead to a Bush supporter saying something like: "M&M's because he may have a hard shell, but deep down I think he's a real sweety." To which a Kerry supporter would respond: "Technically M&amp;M's aren't candy  bars , nitwit." This would lead to loud shouting and maybe fisticuffs, which would make for really good television.   If you could ride one ride at the carnival with John Kerry, which would it be and why? - The correct answer is his jowls.   If John Edwards ran one attraction at this carnival, which would it be and why? -&nbsp;Hopefully someone would say: "None, he'd set up a lawyer booth to sue when one of the rides comes crashing down."   Which word better describes George Bush: lava or magma? - Even I'm mystified by this question and I came up with it.   Which Olsen Twin are you more attracted to? - Just to see if everyone's still awake.   If Dick Cheney could have dinner with any person, living or dead, who would it be and why? - A good cardiologist for obvious reasons.   Is John Edwards more of a Dick York or a Dick Sergeant?&nbsp;- Either way, he's still second banana.   True or false: George Bush totally rules at pack man. - Who knows? He might.   You've been invited to John Kerry's birthday party, what do you bring as a gift? - I don't know. What do you get the man who married the woman who has everything?   See now wouldn't this be fun. I think that I may have found my calling. I should run focus groups. I'd be just as useful, but at least twice as entertaining as the guys they have running them now. All I'd really need to do is keep a straight face, and act like I know what I'm doing. That doesn't sound hard at all. How do you think I got through college?   Shalom

      I watch alot of day time television.  I'm one to just sit down and click away, but I definitely have it on in the background, as my summer days grind away in the most boring fashion available to me.  And there are one group of commercials that not only succeed in making me laugh every time, but also intrigue me far more than they should.  These commercials are for entrepreneurial (a word SHU seems to love for some reason) credit machines that do all the work and give you all the cash.  Not only are they perfect for the wanna-be millionare inside of us all, but they also require us to do nothing but suck in the sweet sweet cash!  You may have seen the commercials yourself.  These wonder machines include ATM machines in fast food chains, internet access points, wireless hotspots, and movie rental machines.  That's right, you can rent movies... from a vending machine.  Apparently, these machines do nothing but rake in the dough.  All you do is pick a location, set up the machine, and then stop by every once in a while to get your loot.  It begs the question, "Why aren't we all doing this?!  Why am I going to college?  Why am I even working on graphic design, when all I have to do is get a key, walk down to my giant movie-renting-machine and get my loot?"  This operation is literally the deus ex machina that will come and end my working career (which has been lazy as best thanks to my Trib job).    What's even better about all of this, is the lifestyle I will have once I get my machines.  According to the commercials, I will become an old man with a full head of gray hair.  I will get to wear Hawaiian shirts while sitting by a huge pool, and have an attractive girl in a bikini look over my shoulder as I monitor my money from an old Apple iBook!  Holy shit!  This is the life of a king, I tell you... a king!  I know this is exactly how Bill Gates and Ted Turner live.  I just know it.  And soon, I shall be with them...  well, not WITH them, but in the same class as them.  Getting taxed less (hopefully) than the average man, but instead of giving out more jobs like most billionaires, I will make my billions from the machine.  Perhaps I will hire someone to go around and pick up the money for me... a small Cuban boy.  That way I won't look like an American jerk.  I'm giving back to the community, and letting Pepe' get some exercise.  And of course, thanks to Global Link (the enigmatic company behind these marvelous machines) and my sex-slave Adonna, I will be the mysterious billionaire that I always strived to be.  I will have no choice but to become a super villain, hiring thousands of nameless henchmen, and that guy with the question mark suit who is always being chased by the feds, and I will take over the world in my zeppelin.  That's right... a zeppelin.    But there is just one loose end that needs tied up...  and that is of this mysterious video rental machine.  I just don't get it.  Somehow the movie titles will be updated (I'm assuming by one of my drones) and somehow people are going to return these things?  If they don't, Pepe' will have to break their legs.  But really, is this more convenient than going to Hollywood Video or Blockbuster?  No matter, money will come regardless!  If you too are interested in the exciting business of owning a machine that takes money from people, contact  urlLink Global Link .  They have a helpful website filled with confusing words and charts depicting nonsense!   It's like the website says: "Global Link was launched in 1996 with a simple and yet challenging vision: to look at the world from the desktop of the buy-side and to create efficiencies through the intelligent application of technology to real-world business needs for information, liquidity access, and workflow improvements. In short, the mission is to deliver one 'window' through which the buy-side can access unique fact-based research and trade any asset class, anywhere, with anyone. In close collaboration with our clients, we are progressively delivering each stage of our vision."   Hell yes.  Hell yes...

      By most accounts - some could even argue by all accounts - my life is far from successful. My problems are many and varied. I am with out gainful employment. My hairline is receding. I live with my parents. I have no luck with women - this, of course, could be a result of the rest of my problems. I am very clumsy, often annoying, and love bad hair bands of the 1980's - however, I can't stand good hair bands of the 1980's, although I can't say I've ever heard of any.  &nbsp;  Now, I am aware that I do have some good qualities. Those with an incredible gift of perception may even be able to notice some of them. I am fairly well read, more or less intelligent and occasionally amusing. I'm a good listener, in many ways unselfconscious, and I make great omelets. Also, I love bad hair bands of the 1980's.  &nbsp;  My major problem, I have decided, is that I lack a certain force of will, strength of commitment, courage, intestinal fortitude, balls, etc. I live too much of my life inside of my own head. I lack the strength, desire, or bravery to move ideas out of the intellectual realm and into the physical, everyday realm. I cannot realize my full potential, because - through either fear or apathy - I cannot make myself fully responsive to the world at large. I need to move beyond myself. Take the strength of my mind and apply it to the world. I need to develop my intellectual and social courage in much the same way I have developed my body from flabby to almost ok. I need to gain some strength. I need machismo. I need to jump out of my seat, run out into the street with the crazed look of a blind man who can suddenly see. I need to experience and I need to do. I need to grab life by the lapels, shake it around, and generally make it my woman. In short, I need a mustache.  &nbsp;  Ah, yes, the mustache: the facial hair of the man of action. Mustaches practically breath decisiveness. Quick, think of the mustache. Who comes to mind? Clark Gable. Magnum PI. Rollie Fingers. Cowboys. Every hero of every 70's cop movie or television show. Barber shop quartets. Porn stars. Groucho Marx. Every state trouper. All men of action. Men who know who they are, know what they want, and get it. That is the power of the mustache.  &nbsp;  So, is it any wonder that I, weak willed as I am, long for a mustache, would treasure a mustache, would comb it thrice daily, would wax the ends into intricate curly-Q's. I quake with desire for a mustache. I have started growing one. I picture it in my minds eye, thick and full, flowing down the corners of my mouth, covering my upper lip in a luxurious facial hair canopy of manhood. I see myself on job interviews, employers falling all over themselves to have me be a part of their company. "By George," they'll say, "just take a gander at that magnificent mustache. We must employ that man. Quick get the benefits package together." I can see myself at the bars and the clubs. I can see the women swooning over me. "By George," they'll say, "look at that mustache. He is clearly more man than the rest of these bare lipped fools. Quick, we must go lavish feminine attention upon him."  &nbsp;  I am growing my mustache. It is currently little more than stubble at the moment. I am sure that I will have to withstand the horrible, 'I think a caterpillar died on your upper lip' stage of mustache growth, the stage which most men cannot progress past. I know that some people are going to sneer and mock my mustache. "By George," they'll say, "You look like a pervert (or a pedaphile, or a member of the village people, or Teddy Roosevelt)." I can handle this. I will simply laugh it off, because I know - deep down I just know - that mustaches are kick ass, and those losers are only jealous of the power and the majesty that is the mustache.  &nbsp;  I also know that some people are skeptical. Not so much toward the power of the mustache - which is undeniable - but toward my ability to handle responsibly the greatness of the mustache. These people may argue that you must first have the mustache attitude then the mustache follows naturally. That to grow the mustache and then hope for the attitude is a fools errand. "By George," they are probably saying, "this chap's mustache will surely wither and die upon his lip. The attitude predicates the mustache, not vice verse." Now, this is a very interesting question. It has a number of philosophical facets dealing as it does with issues of causality, individuality, and personality. So, I must be careful in addressing this objection. However, I feel that I am up to the challenge. So, to these people I say: EAT IT!! I'm growing a mustache and that's all there is to it. The mustache is going to be kick ass and so am I. If you losers can't handle that, you better shut up and get out of my way. Because, by George, I'm growing a mustache and I'm coming through. There is no stopping me now. Nothing can stand in the way of the mustache. Nothing......Unless, of course, my mom doesn't like it.  &nbsp;  Shalom

      My brother has been feeding me these ridiculous-but-true facts all day now (I am guessing he was literally saving them for a rainy day)... and there was one that really stuck out in my mind.  That of the British-Zanzibar War, the shortest war in history.  So I decided to google this so-called war to find out more about it.  What I found was an intriguing journal entry written by the incredibly mysterious Sultan of Zanzibar.  What follows is a series of fateful entries written on the day of the war.  August 22, 6am  Dearest Journal, today I have been appointed the SULTAN of ZANZIBAR!  How sweet is that?  Of course, given the circumstances of my appointment, I must take this job with merely a grin instead of a full-blown crescent moon smile.  My father, the long-time Sultan Tad Storkensburg, died last night of irritable bowel syndrome.  I think there was something in his Zanzibarian Burger that really disagreed with him.  Alas, I mourn my father's gruesome and disgusting death, and I welcome my new title of Sultan!  It's so much cooler than "Saltine."    My first act as Sultan is to stand up to those awful Brits.  The Brits and the Germans have been fighting over my island for years now, and I'm damn sick and tired of it.  The Brits keep wanting this island so they can move into Africa, the Germans want this island so they can put a Volkswagon factory on it.  Zanzibar is my homeland, as obscure and ridiculous as that sounds, and I will not let it slip into the hands of the straightbacks from the north!  So, after speaking with Germany, they've decided to back me up as I stand up to the Brits.  My dad had good relations with those limey bastards for years, but now that he's out of the way I'm gonna kick some ass!  August 22, 1896 9am  Dearest journal, I just declared war on the Brits.  I know what you're thinking... I'm in office for three hours and I already declared war on the biggest nation in the world.  Maybe I was a little hasty, but I stand by my decision.  I declared war about twenty minutes ago, and I'm ready for whatever they are going to throw at me!  I have 2,500 Arab troops ready and willing to be slaughtered for the well-being of Zanzibar.  I also have this really boss gold cannon from 1658.  Back in the day, I hear, we used to use this cannon for everything... we even fought off the Egyptians or something.  But ever since then it's been sitting in front of the Zanzibarian Court House just collecting dust.  I also got this sweet old ship...  it's like a wooden viking boat.  Only it's not a viking boat because vikings didn't come down here... often.  August 22, 1896 9:05am  Dear J-Dog, The British are pretty much surrounding the island with their large-ass ships.  Any normal Sultan would be thinking he had made a mistake, but I know I'm doing the right thing.  I will be the Sultan to end all Sultans!  Let it be known that Reggie Storkensburg, The Sultan of Zanzibar, was the most courageous leader ever.  With the exception of Jesus.  Anyways, right now we are sort of waiting... my troops are just sitting on the beaches playing card games and volleyball and the British keep cocking their rifles at us.  I hope something happens pretty soon, I have a tennis date with the Czar of Uberbeckingstand at noon.  Did I spell his country right?  Oh well, no one's gonna read this anyways.  August 22, 1896 9:15am  Shit!  Snap!  Dag!  Holy flaming crap!  The Brits have decided to start shooting cannon balls at my island!  One shot took out 500 of my troops, who were in the middle of a round robin volleyball tournament on the north shore!  I have decided to bring out my golden cannon, which I have named "Fat Man."  I have three cannon balls, which I have named "Little Boy."  Those Brits are going to have some trouble coming there way as soon as Fat Man shoots the Little Boys!    August 22, 1896 9:25am  This isn't going at all like I had planned.    August 22, 1896 9:35am  Okay, okay, okay, all of my troops are dead.  That's what I get for hiring all these Arabs to do the job... everyone knows Arabs can't swim!  My viking ship has been totally destroyed, even worse they spray painted a giant space gun on the side of it before they set it on fire.  Those British sure do know how to make you feel stupid.  Although I must stay that they aren't nearly as polite as everyone thinks.  Let's just hope my cannon holds out!  August 22, 1896 9:37am  Murphy's Law kicked in... my uber-boss cannon just burst into flames!  It's made of gold, how did this happen?!  August 22, 1896 9:45am  Dear Journal, you are now looking at the former Sultan of Zanzibar... that's right.  I gave up.  I couldn't take it anymore!  The Brits had me backed up against the wall here.  And so after 45 minutes of being pummeled by these jerks, I gave up.  I kinda forgot that my population consisted of just 2,500 Arabs, and since they were all dead now... I figured I might as well cut my losses and live to rule another day.  Luckily, my sausage-welding friends from Middle Europe, let me stay at their consulate.  Those Germans are alright, ya know?  I mean, they really know what they are doing, and I wouldn't be surprised if they really make a difference in the world.  I'd stake my Sultan reputation on it.    Anyways, goodbye my lovely journal... the Germans won't allow me to bring this into the consulate, so I must leave it on this board and float it out to sea.  Maybe someday those Brits will find it and see all of the stuff I said about em.  Won't they feel bad!  -33-  Wow.  That Sultan was a cool dude.

      Those of you who keep up with the news - I know you're out there somewhere - will most likely remember the big story about the Super Strong Mutant German Boy a few weeks back. For those of you who only get your news from 'Entertainment Tonight' - I know you're out there everywhere - allow me to enlighten you. It was recently revealed that a boy in Germany (I want to say he's currently 5 years old) was born with a genetic mutation - yes, I said genetic mutation - which has caused him to grow muscles at a prodigious, unnatural rate. He can already lift more weight than some full grown adults. He could probably lift two Mary-Kate Olsens straight over his head, but only one and a half Ashley Olsens. So, the Super Strong Mutant Boy - who I will from this point on refer to as SSMG boy, or better yet, as SSMuG Boy, or even better still, smug boy - being a true genetic freak, was paraded around the news for attention.  Now that a few weeks have gone by and most of the news has moved on to new stories, something about smug boy still bothers me. No, it's not that there's a five year old out there who can kick my ass. I've been getting my ass kicked by five year olds for years. It no longer bothers me. What bothers me is how the whole thing was covered. It was seen as a medical, scientific miracle. Something to be studied. Maybe this boy's DNA could unlock keys to healing those with debilitating diseases, or lead to a safer alternative to steroid therapy. While this is all good and wonderful, I can't help thinking the news media has missed the main story. This kid is a genetic mutant - a MUTANT. Doesn't anyone understand what this means? The age of the X-Men could very well be upon us. This kid could be a member of the first generation of genuine, real super heroes and super villains. Smug boy's a German so, obviously, he's destined to be a super villain.  This is huge, and the news media completely dropped the ball. We could be heading toward a war of humans vs. Mutants, or humans and good mutants vs. evil mutants, or good humans/mutants vs. evil humans/mutants, or, most frightening yet, everybody vs. evil shepherds. This could be the most dynamic time in human history as super powerful mutants with a proclivity toward spandex rise to power.  Still, I don't want to rush to any judgment. That's why I didn't write this post weeks ago when the story was fresh. I needed to take some time and see if I could confirm my suspicions. If the age of the X-men is truly upon us, then other mutants must be out there within a generation or two of smug boy. Surely, at least some of these people are already adults and have used their powers to move into a position of power and fame. All I need is to use my keen power of perception and my television remote to weed them out.   I want everyone to sit down. It is time for me to announce my findings. After days of study including extensive reading, monitoring of television broadcast, and three square meals a day, I have determined that the age of the mutant is indeed upon us. In fact, it is much more extensive than I first suspected.  My first tip was Ken Jennings. Ken Jennings, for those of you not in the know, is the man who has been Jeopardy champion for almost 30 days. I've been monitoring him with much interest. He is almost unbeatable. His trivial knowledge and thumb reflexes are clearly superior to the average man's. Clearly, Ken Jennings is a mutant who was born with an abnormally large Trivial Cortex - the part of your brain set aside for facts on the court of King Edward II and other such tid bits - as well as genetically advanced thumbflexes - sorry about the technical terminology; it's unavoidable. So, now the only remaining question is whether or not Ken Jennings is a super hero or a super villain. Let's look at the facts: ken Jennings is Super intelligent, kind of weasely looking, and Mormon. Clearly, he's a super villain.  Also, there's Saddam Hussein. He's been in the news a lot due to his trial in which he has exhibited mutant like abilities. In the face of a criminal court, with a possible death penalty in the mix, Saddam had the guts to defend his actions. He even claimed to still be the president of Iraq. Clearly, Saddam has been born with large - unnaturally, mutantly large - balls. Good thing we already have him in custody. Also, the whole genocidal mad man thing kind of indicates he just might be a super villain, not a super hero.  So, I found 3 mutants, then last night I hit the motherlode: VH1's 'I love the 90's'. I'm sure everyone's familiar with the the VH1 specials. You may think they're harmless or you may think they're annoying, but - after my discovery - everyone's going to find them terrifying. All the commentators on 'I love the 90's' are mutants. Every last one of them from the annoying guy from 'Talk Soup' to the annoying guy from 'Ed'. This is the first evidence I have found of a conglomerate of mutants. Not only are they all mutants, they're all mutants in the same way. They have all been born with the uncanny - that's right, uncanny - ability to maintain a career in entertainment with no discernible talent. Clearly, all these people were born with a genetically advanced Zsa Zsa gland - or what scientist often refer to today as the Keanu/Shore gland. This gland controls dumb luck and the ability to be on television with nothing to say. Most frightening of all, these celebrity mutants are all super villains. It's obvious. They don't have an airplane. All teams of super heroes have a tricked out plane. In absence of a plane, it becomes obvious that this mutant team is truly evil.  Finally, I feel the need to take a closer look at myself. What if I am a mutant? It's worth a look. Let's see. I'm not super strong. I have decent hearing, but not mutant hearing. I have bad eyesight. My sense of smell is average. I can't shoot any kind of laser from my eyes. When I touch other people the only thing that happens is I get slapped. After jumping off my garage I've confirmed that I can't fly. My bones do break. I'm balding. I'm unemployed. I live with my parents. I have no real drive to accomplish anything in my life... Oh, my god... I am a mutant. Can't you see? I've been born with a genetically superior apathymous. I have powers of apathy far beyond that of the average person. The best part, I'm not a super hero or a super villain. You actually have to care to be labeled either of those. I've been born with the only great power which does not come with great responsibility. I can live with that...I guess...whatever.  Shalom

      Tomorrow I turn the ripe old age of 19...  a year that just doesn't seem as special as the past three.  Think back, have you ever heard anyone say, "I can't wait to turn 19!"  It's the minor rift after the big waves caused by birthdays 16-18.  These milestones, to which like all kids, have always held things that I have always looked forwards to.  When you turn 16, you can drive; when you turn 17, you can see R-Rated movies; when you turn 18, you can do all sorts of things; but when you turn 19... well.    Turning 19 not only fails to unlock any new abilities (if you want to look at this like it's a videogame) but it also leaves you, at least in my family, poor and lonely.  In my family, you have birthday parties until you are 12, and you get presents from your relatives until you are 18.  After that you are considered an "adult" and subject to moneyless cards, a birthday dinner and a pat on the back.  That isn't to say I'm some sort of ungrateful punk... but knowing that nothing special is happening makes my birthday, once a sacred event that balanced my year with Christmas, is now a holiday about as important as Arbor Day or Boxing Day in Canada.    They (society?) really should have spaced out everything you can do when you turn 18.  Is it really necessary to make the age of 18 such a gateway to the world, when 19 and 20 have absolutely nothing special going on.  Since turning 18, I've been able to drive after midnight , buy lottery tickets, get into strip clubs, buy pornography, purchase tobacco products, drink and gamble on international waters, drive out of state, and date people only older than 18 (which made for a few laughs when I was dating Aubrey).  But aside from driving out of state and driving past 11PM, I haven't really taken advantage of my 18 year old status.  So why not push the porn related abilities back to 20, and the lottery tickets and tobacco back until I'm 19.  Then I have something to look forward to each year, although that 20th birthday would be sort of weird.    That, or they can just make other things off limits, and have them be available to me after I turn 19.  Like purchasing computer parts.  You don't really need to do dabble with the inner workings of your computer until you are out of high school.  Ban eating peas until you are 19, so you are mature enough not to scatter them all over your plate and dining room floor.  You also shouldn't be allowed to become a pop idol until you are 19, nor are you allowed to become a sex symbol until that time (I've decided on waiting until I'm 25 to do either of those things... personal rule.)  And so by now you should be feeling pretty bad for me and my pitiful age of 19... but don't!  My birthday is actually going to be a good day, I assure you!  I have decided to overcome adversity and ignore the fact that I can't do anything new during my 19th year on this earth.  So instead I am getting fed all day.  Tomorrow I plan on waking up, pouring some water on the floor for my homies, and heading over to my beloved Aunt's apartment for french toast.  Then it's off to lunch with a friend... and then coffee with another friend.  No sooner will I arrive home will I be eating some more, this time it's my birthday dinner cooked by Mom.  So if anything, maybe I will gain some weight the day I turn 19!    I'm very thankful for my 19 years, and I'm only sort of thankful for looking like I've only been around for 13 years.  But hey, at least now I can buy lottery tickets and eat peas!

      Today more than one bird flew into the screen that I have in my bedroom window. My room is not that interesting, nor does it look appealing to birds (no worms or bird porn). Now I realize I've blogged a lot, so that means I'm bored and need a real job, just like my mom keeps telling me.   If there is anyone out there who knows about birds, maybe they can tell me why birds seem to flock to the roof of my front porch. It's very strange. I live in the middle house of five row houses. But the birds hang out on the edge of the roof of my roof only. All the roofs are red. They all look the same. In fact, they are all beveled the same, so what makes my roof different?  I know my house is a party house. It's had a history of good parties, not least of which was our halloween party last year. So maybe there's a good bird vibe on the porch roof. The thing that kinda creeps me out is the fact that birds come from all over the neighborhood to do it on our roof. I'm serious! I just noticed something different about our roof. Since we're in the middle, we have a little wooden knob sticking up in the center. And I just remembered seeing birds hanging out there a lot. Maybe that piece of wood is like the bird throne. And whoever sits on it gets all the chicks...literally.   Now I'm no ornithilogical Dr. Ruth, but maybe there's something to that place on our roof. I don't watch the birds having sex, but on more than one occasion, I've been awakened to loud bird noises close to my head and I slowly open my eyes to witness hot heavy freaky bird lovin' right on my roof.   That's not as bad as the night my bed was right by the window and my head was right by the window. I heard a noise and turned over and I was looking a racoon square in the face. We both screamed and he took off.   I see birds come over and chirp and then other birds join it and the sex is on!  I wish there was a human equivilent to saying "Hey, I'm on the bird throne, come over here so I can do you." Life would be a lot simpler.

      Now, most of my blogs are indeed not funny, just sort of ranting. Well this one is no different. I have a friend that went back to school. He's a little older than me and last night at about 1 AM we had a discussion on the computer about politics. He went to an "We hate Bush" kind of rally in Oakland. He said I would have not liked it since I was "one of those..you know Rs." (republicans, which seems to now be the party of the people strangely enough from what the news says. They want to give the power to you instead of taking it and letting decisions be made by the government, cause apparently the democrats know what I need more than I do! But that’s another argument)  He then proceeded to say that the whole system needs to be changed. I was like "What? What? What?" a la Kyle's mom on South Park. He said democracy exploited people. And I laughed and asked what system does not? Democracy is the longest running and most successful political experiment in all of the world's history. He argued that monarchies were longer, so I had to point out that every time a new king or queen takes the throne, it's a whole different government. We've had the same government for centuries now. How awesome is that? It may not be perfect, but it's the best there is.   I asked him for alternatives. He said ... socialism. Which of course can't work in a country as large in land and population as the US. There are places like Norway that have socialistic tendencies and they work for the small freezing country of the hot, tall, and all super white.   He said you just have to have enough people to want it, that’s all. That’s all? That’s the hardest thing of all and that’s why it won’t work. Cuba has been trying for a long time to be a communist state. They have a small population and small amount of land to control, and THEY can’t even get their shit together. There are less minds to change there than anywhere else.  This is why communism is absolute horseshit.  Here’s an example: You’re at a store. The clerk says, “I’ll give whoever gets to the counter first all their stuff for free, or you can both get here at the same time and I’ll give you 50% off.” Now, some people would want to work together, but most people would be like “screw him” and try and get free stuff. We are ready to screw the other person for personal gain. There can be none of those people at all for communism or true socialism to work. Personally, I’m glad to be one of those greedy bastards. That’s what makes our economy run: the search for more for me.   I said that for any step towards a social society, you have to change the hearts of men and women, not the government. Government and indeed all sovereignty is granted by the people. So unless all the people want it, it doesn’t happen. You can’t change people’s heart with force. That will make them resent you and hate your happy, feel good government.   He said it takes time. I told him that’s impossible. For as many as you change to your mindset, there will be changing back, or switching to the other side for the first time. The only way to change it is all together with a Marxist revolution (to see a great example of what that is, watch the movie ANTZ). You get rid of the people that don’t agree. The workers rise and revolt. And the world becomes a time share, kibbutz style.   Communism is great on paper. Socialism seems even workable on paper. But there is one problem: people tend to be jerks. You go back to Marx and Rousseau and they think people are naturally good. But there is a whole other camp of people that think people are naturally bad. I’m in the latter simply because if we were meant to be good, it’d be a lot easier to be good than bad.   So while communism is a fun thing to talk about in college, and even a nice daydream. It’s never going to happen cause someone will always take advantage of the situation. Read Animal Farm by Orwell. All there needs to be in one person to screw it up. With democracy, if one person is screwing up, the people kick his or her ass to the curb. That’s why we need to vote. You do have the power, like He Man. People discount that power, but it’s tough, and right now, mostly old people use it.   So get out of your peace and love hippy haze, your happy land of suger plum trees and lollipop lakes and wake up and smell the crusty burnt 7-11 coffee at the bottom of the pot. Democracy is ever changing and slightly flawed but anything else just doesn’t make sense. So yes, communism is horse shit.

      Now I know some people see me as the epitome of whiteness. I'm clearly on the bottom rung of middle class. I'm tall, well liked, can go to the bank and find I have good credit, went to college, did fairly well.  But yet there's something else. I mean I severely attracted to women of color. My last two girlfriends were black and puerto rican. In my mind, this begs the question: Am I really as white as people think I am? I mean I can dance. I can understand and use correctly almost all hip-hop slang. I have a very Jewish sense of humor. I love soul food and tex mex. And I adore both Chinese food and little children (Let's face it, they are the cutest.)  Maybe this has happened because of my life experience. I mean I did work with a hugely diverse population when I was in Austria. And now I work almost exclusively with African American children and am often the only non-black person in the room. But I liked southern food well before that. Although, thank God for my discovering greens. If you have never had them.....mmmmmm. It's a vegetable that tastes like meat. Can it get better? No, I think not. Plus, you can't work in Shadyside with kids and parents and not have a little Jewishness rub off. After my second summer there, "Oy vey" became part of my regular conversation.   Of course, it might also be because I'm so German. We got fatty foods and mass genocide to look back on, and no one's smiling at that. I do enjoy a good polka or Weiner Shnitzel every now and again, and I was glad for the Austria experience to catch a little of my ancestry.   I think what's really going on is I'm part of a new melting pot in America that is strictly culteral. Our hearts are melting and we're sharing customs, foods, games, whole cultures. Plus, we have a new world culture that is based on the internet, video games, anime, and cell phones. It's a weird esperonto-like phenomenon that's working. the shorthand of instant messaging is becoming a new form of spelling. Kindegarteners are more computer literate than me.   We still label people by their skin color, but we're so different inside. It's like people that say their outside is male, but the inside is female. Maybe my outside is white and my inside is latino.

      I am writing to inform everyone that my life has officially bottomed out. Now, I'm not writing this for pity. I'm not writing this out of some sick,therapeutic need to purge every little detail from my soul - which, from my limited experience, seems to be all the rage amongst bloggers. No, I write this because it's really quite amusing. Amusing in a bitter-my-life-is-going-no-where sort of way, but amusing none the less.  You see, I was turned down for a job at Burger King. I don't mean to toot my own horn or anything, but I am pretty sure that I'm qualified. Heck, some may even call me over-qualified. After all, I am college educated. I graduated from a decent school - Grove City College - with decent grades - (ahem)magna cum laude (ahem). I'm sure no one else working at Burger King is capable of the following conversation: "Sir, your fries will be up in a second. In the meantime, why don't we discuss Bahktin's concept of dialogic?" True, that knowledge doesn't really come in handy at Burger King. As a matter of fact, as I've discovered, it really doesn't come in handy anywhere.  The really weird thing is I kinda wanted the job at Burger King. I am practically broke. The money, while far from ample, would be appreciated. The hours would've been alright. Plus, it's not like it's my long term career goal. My long term career goal is to drive the Oscar Mayer wiener mobile. Ahh, dreams.  And I have other problems too. My car - the '93 Lumina I affectionately call 'The Silver Bullet' - is in dire need of brake work. They squeak and squeal and grind. I only turn up the radio. What I can't hear, doesn't exist. My parents - instead of hounding me to move out - have become far too acceptive of my presence. They now make long term plans assuming I will be living at home. I'm not talking about a couple of months in advance. I'm talking about retirement plans. This is somehow much more depressing than having them hound me. I think even my parents have lost hope in me.  I do have some plans, secret untested ways to make some cash. I think I might befriend an eccentric billionaire, get in on his will and then the next thing you know the cops are over and I'm saying: "I dunno officer. He musta just fell down the stairs." If I can't shut my conscience up long enough to do that I've got back ups. For instance, I am currently selling advertising space on this blog. For a small, negotiable fee I will head each post with my current sponsor - I can just see it: 'Today's blog entry is brought to you by preparation H, preparation H, for all your hemorrhoid needs'. I could also slyly insert advertising subconsciously into the blog entries. Hold on while I take a long, slow sip of an ice cold Coke-a-cola. Mmmm, nothing satisfies like Coke on a hot day.   Now where was I? Oh yes, hair brained schemes for money. Now it's time for my favorite scheme. You know how people pay good money for those fancy psychiatrist and therapist with their fancy degrees in their field and all they do is listen to you and offer no advice? Well, I figure I could do that. I can listen to people complain about their lives and their parents. I can offer no solutions. And I could do it for a whole lot less money. So, I'm glad to announce that I'm now an official unlicensed therapist. For only $10 an hour I will listen to your problems. For $13 an hour, I'll pretend to care.  So, even though my life has hit rock bottom, do not despair for me. I've got my ideas and my creativity. I am sure that I'm going to make it after all, and someday, someday I am going to drive than wiener.  Shalom

      As I'm sure all of you know - or at least I hope you do - we are in the midst of an election year. Come November we Americans - or at least the 30% of us who vote - will go out to the polls and cast our lot with either George W. Bush or John Kerry. This is a momentous decision, but if you are like an ever growing number of people I run into, you don't really care. This is especially painfully true of our young people. Yes, I know - as I posted on our previous, long forgotten blog - voting isn't cool. It never has been nor never will be. So, I think what young people need is a candidate they can really get behind.  With this said, I would like to take this moment to declare my candidacy for the Presidency of the United States of America. Yes, I know according to the so-called 'Constitution'I am too 'young' to run for president. To this charge I only have one reply: constitution shmonstitution. I have my right to seek gainful employment and I shouldn't be blocked. This rule is clearly biased against the young. This is the same reason high schoolers can play in the NBA. Now all I need to find is some judge to eviscerate the constitution. That shouldn't be hard. It's what they seem to do.  Now that that's out of the way, I know what your next question is: "But James why should we vote for you?" A very good question, deserving of a very good answer. So why should you vote for me. Because I'm super cool, that's why. But don't take my word for. My mom thinks I'm super cool too. She also thinks I'm very handsome and quite a catch. So, there naysayers. You don't hear Bush or Kerry's mothers saying that.   Still not convinced? Want to know where I stand on the issues, what my platform is? Fine. I now proudly unveil the platform which will carry me to victory come November. I, James Catullo, promise the following:  1) Mondays, according to my careful research of Garfield comics, are the worse day of the week. Therefore, once I am president, I shall declare that every Monday morning from 10:30 to 11 AM be dubbed 'Dance Party USA'. During this time, according to the law, all business shall cease and all Americans shall dance as they see fit.  2) The band Nickelback will stop recording and touring.  3) I will lower taxes.  4) All Americans will be able to declare 1 personal holiday a year. On their personal holidays people will be excused from work or school. This holiday can be any day and for any reason. If you wish to spend the day at home in observance of Scott Baio's birthday, so be it.  5) Women will want to go out with me. I'm adding it to the constitution. Either they go out with me or they go to prison.  6) I will build more prisons to house the expected millions of women who still won't go out without me.  7) I will cut the size of government.  and finally...  8) I will change the national anthem to 'The Hustle.' This way whenever an American Olympic athlete wins a gold medal, he or she will do a reverent and tearful rendition of 'The Hustle' on the winners podium. And that's funny.   So, come November remember you have another choice besides Bush or Kerry - and no, I don't mean Nader. When you vote, America, I want you to remember the only candidate who really knows what it means to be American. I want you to remember the only candidate who speaks to you in the language you understand, the language of old sitcoms. Most of all America, I want you to remember: DO THE HUSTLE!! (do do do do do do do)  Shalom

      Now, as little mike aforemantioned, there is a new theatre in beaver county.  May I echo that it does indeed beat the pants off the old Carmike Theatre across the way.  To start, it cost 7 dollars for a movie.  Carmike, $7.50.  Now not just the ticket prices, but everything has prices that small, significant ammount lower that you could say, YEA! it's better, And Cheaper.   Now i saw Spiderman 2 last night, and I'll say i didn't like it as well as the first.  Yes, the CGI is a bit cleaner, and the build up was good, but the story was not as... well... "yea that kicks ass"-esque.  A fight scene with Doc. Octopus cuold have gone longer and been better (a significant source of untapped territory), and the plot somewhat turns you against spidey, but a scene with a runaway train was done very well. But that is not why i Blog for you today!  The eason is simple...Donnie Iris. As i left work on wed. it was aobut 6:50 when i heard on the radio, DVE nonetheless, that Michelle Michaels was at the new Cinemark Theatre in Monaca, and she was antici...........pating the concert event of the week... Donnie Iris and B.E. Taylor would be performing an acoustic set at the opening of the new Theatre. Holy King of Cool Batman!  I had to get down there!  So going as fast as the legal limit would allow me, I raced over the the Lowes Shopping center to catch the cool King, B.E., and some kick ass guitarist named Rick belting out 8 Days A Week, Rocky Racoon, I wanna Hold Your Hand, Love is like a Rock, Vitimin L, Ah Leia, and The Star Spangled Banner for an encore.  It was so great.  Plus i won a free T-shirt for an upcoming movie called "Harold and Kumar go to White Castle"  And an Allman Bros. CD. All in all, a great compilation of events for a wednesday night.

      "Hey, a prisoner on death row escaped in his incredible flying machine!  He's getting away, quick turn on the spotlights and try and find him!"    I can only hope that someday, that is a possibility, just so there can be more spotlights in the sky.  I really don't think there are enough... at least not around here.  I'm sure in Hollywood they have millions of spotlights (of course they are harder to see due to the intense smog and their even more intense governor.)  Around Beaver County, however, these things are pure luxury that comes around ever few years.  Let's see... I remember spotlights for the new Wal-Mart that opened (so they can let everyone know where to protest, of course), there were spotlights when Lowe's opened (I think Lowe's actually sells spotlights, actually...) and the Mall had spotlights years ago when they remodeled it.  And of course we have a spotlight just dedicated to the Beaver County superhero: The Cruiser (he tends to concentrate his powers while sitting in front of his '72 mustang at the county's weekly car cruises...)    There were spotlights in the sky last night.  In a weird twist, they were not only buzzing around to celebrate the opening of a Spider-Man 2, but also to celebrate the opening of a brand new Cinemark movie theater.  Two great reasons to have spotlights in the sky.  My area of Beaver County, which houses the tri-shopping mecca of Wal-Mart plaza, Lowe's Plaza, and the Beaver Valley Mall, is now experiencing its consumer renaissance.   The trend nowadays has moved beyond strip malls, outlets, and indoor malls and has moved to the "shopping village."  It's a set of malls, warehouse stores, and strip outlets along with a movie theater and a ton of over-priced restaurants (the kind that have their walls covered with crazy crap).  And that's when that area becomes known only for its stores.  For example, Robinson Twp, Cranberry, Boardman.  Three huge shopping meccas that I only know because I go there to shop and have a good time.  I have heard rumors that people actually live in these places, going about their daily lives and ignoring the frightening things that are operating right down the street (kind of like the folks that live near the power plant).  Is this the fate of my town and my county?  And really... is that a bad thing?  Last night marked the grand opening of a new Cinemark movie theater in the area.  12 theaters, stadium seating, surround sound, and reasonably priced tickets.  This, of course, beats the pants off of our former theater, which could be described as "malnourished," which had eight theaters, sticky and flat floors, ripped seats, and ticket prices that required you to take out a loan.  Did I mention they only got the "big" movies?  Hopefully our new neighbors at the Mark will be wise enough to get me some juicy independent movies... or at least the new Woody Allen movie coming out this fall.    Now I haven't been to this theater yet, although that will change when I go there tonight, but I hear its pretty nice.  It sits in the newest of the shopping centers in Beaver County.  There is a brand-new Shop n Save and the aforementioned Lowe's right next door.  And they are in the process of building a Starbucks (yes!), a Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Home Depot, and Best Buy all within the next couple years.  We are truly on our way...   and I couldn't be happier about it!  Sure this may bring a tad more traffic, but these things are far enough away from my house that I won't be bothered.  And at the same time, I won't have to drive 30 minutes to get to the stores I love.  Most of the people in Beaver County leave the county to go shopping, and now all of that money will stay here!    And so in conclusion, I welcome you new theater.  I thank you for riding in on a horse that looks and sounds wonderful, for bringing Spider-Man 2 with you (a movie that I've not only been looking forward to, but will totally knock Michael Moore out of the box office), and for further murdering live theatre in Beaver County!

      There is a great and vile evil roaming free upon our land, a pestilence, a blight upon the very soul of our great country. Nothing can divert this rank villainy. What, you might ask, could be so foul? Is it AIDS? Is it poverty? Is it rhetorical questions? No. No. No. I am talking about a plague at once more benign and more devilish than any of these. I am talking about a scourge which wants nothing more than to ruin your good times. I am talking about those idiots who bring guitars to parties and want to 'jam'.  If you attend a good number of gatherings, get togethers, parties, and the like, there is a good chance you know exactly what I am talking about. You go to a party, and everything's A-Ok. There's food, people, your choice of fine beverages. People are talking, joking, laughing, having an all around good time. Then, Like a foreboding crack of thunder in the distance, someone brings in his guitar. This is quickly followed by the realization that many people have guitars. Often they drop everything they are doing and run to their car to get them. Eventually, someone suggest that all the guitar players get together somewhere - often in right in the middle of the party - and jam.  For those of you who don't know what I mean by 'jamming', allow me to enlighten you. To jam in the musical sense - as opposed to the raspberry preserve sense - has, in my experience, two definitions. Definition one: What happens when a group of talented musicians get together and play music in a fun and unencumbered way. Definition two: What happens when drunk douche bags get together with guitars - not necessarily in tune - at a party and proceed to annoy anyone who isn't playing. As you can see, jamming in the former definition is fine and I have no problem with it. Jamming in the latter sense however is not fine and I despise it. It has yet - even once - to add anything positive to any party I've ever been to. Quite the contrary, it often ruins parties. It makes conversation more difficult. It's never as entertaining to the people not jamming as it is to the people jamming. As a matter of fact, jamming has the knack of bringing parties to a grinding halt. People are held captive by these idiots - who always play way too loud. The enjoyment of the masses is negated for the enjoyment of a small group of morons.  Now here's the real problem. In every group of jammers - I think I just coined a phrase - there is one guy who is really, genuinely good, and it would probably be okay if just this one alpha guitarist would play by himself. It would be kind of the low rent equivalent of the smooth jazz pianist at high society functions. However, people with guitars always materialize around this alpha guitarist and start jamming with him. This is patently absurd. At the aforementioned high society functions you never hear this said to the smooth jazz pianist: "Dude, I've got a key board in my car. I'm totally going to get it and we are totally going to jam." It just doesn't happen in civilized society.  Of course, the people who join the alpha guitarist are of variable skills. There are usually one or two guys who more or less know what they're doing: play things in the right key, keep rhythm, know a bunch of cords. Even this is kind of OK. At least it doesn't sound horrible. But this is never how it goes because, invariably, the group is joined by some guy - sometimes guys - who just sucks. This guy always plays too loud, plays in the wrong key, and for some reason can't keep his guitar in tune. Now the alpha and beta guitarist - instead of doing the reasonable thing and telling the omega guitarist to get lost - have to play louder to cover up this travesty.  To make matters worse. It always happens that no one knows the same songs. So you get one person trying to show another person how to play something, which they proceed to play poorly. For some reason, they manage to never play a song through the whole way. Often they'll spend twenty minutes noodling around on two or three cords which grows monotonous and dull. And through all of this, the other people at the party are just trying to have a good time. They want to talk to friends, meet new people, laugh, and whatnot, but those stupid jammers just refuse to go away. You can't talk over them. You can't talk to them - and I've had conversations end because all of a sudden my friend just had to jam. You can't even dance to them, because they usually really suck. They are like a black hole in the middle of the party, sucking the fun away from everyone else so that they are the only ones really enjoying themselves. At least they don't eat all the food.  So, in conclusion, let me leave everyone with a good piece of advice. If you are going to a party and want to take a guitar with you, stop for a second. Now, ask yourself a few questions. Are you playing in a band that has been asked to perform at this party? Are you being paid to perform at this party? Are you going to a party where everyone - or at least a vast majority of the people - will jam with you or not mind if you jam? Are you Jimmi Hendrix? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then go, take your guitar. But if you answered no to all these questions, then LEAVE YOUR STUPID GUITAR AT HOME!!! Try having a conversation for a change. You might like it.  Shalom  P.S. I would like everyone's help with a very important decision. I have finally followed through on my promise - made here in this blog a few weeks ago - to grow a mustache. I have not shaved my upper lip for almost a week. As you might imagine, my mustache is in that strange, sleazy, half-there state at the moment. Now this doesn't bother me, but...I have a job interview tomorrow. Should I shave my dirt-stache for my job interview or just keep it? Seriously, I'd like to know what everyone thinks. Even if you don't know me, even if you find yourself on this blog on mistake or on a whim, let me know what you think. Just leave a comment and hopefully they will help me decide whether or not to shave. Thanks.  shalom (again)

      I got a new job! I'm going to sell insurance. That may not sound like much, indeed it's not the thrill a minute lifestyle I'm used to working with bad kids and all, but it's a good job that will pay well if I apply myself. The funny thing is that I will go broke before my job starts. I have to shell out about $300 to get licensed to sell insurance. And the job that I am doing is not paying me until the end of September I recently found out. So that sucks. Yet another reason why insurance will be good for me.  Since I probably won't start the insurance job until the end of september, I need money now to pay these bills and so I can eat. So anyone have any odd jobs in the meantime? Very short term. I will clean your house! I will perk up your slacking young marriage if your wife is a looker. Will improv for dinner and $20! I also love charity. I ma not afraid of it.  Excited in a happy way and a nervous way, Mike the Tall

      Today, I have something to say which I usually do not have the luxury of saying. Today, something exciting happened. No, I did not discover that 'Boy Meets World' is on twice a day on ABC Family. I've known that for quite some time. I am talking about real excitement. I am talking about genuine heart pounding, pulse racing, bowel loosening, staring death in the face excitement. Of course, it's wrapped in the dull and mundane, but such is my life.  Today, I was simply taking a short trip to good old Grove City - which for the uniformed contains no groves and is most certainly a city in name only. I was simply going about my normal activities. Going to the local library, scouring for work and the like. As I piloted my '93 Chevy Lumina - the very sexy, scantily rusted car I have dubbed 'The Silver Bullet' - toward a red light everything was going to plan. My mind was hardly on my driving. I was contemplating such lofty ideas as the responsibilities of free will and the uselessness of Aquaman, as I began to depress my brake pedal. Suddenly, to my abject horror, I found my foot and the pedal drop effortlessly to the floor of my car. There was no resistance, and - even more alarming - there was no deceleration. My brakes had given out.  Now, I would like to say that I remained absolutely cool, calm, collected, poised, but I would also like to say that I run a small island nation in the South Pacific. Needless to say I panicked. There was a truck ahead of me stopped at the light. I was going to crash into it. I just knew it. My heart leaped up into my throat as my stomach dropped down into my bowels. Luckily, my liver stayed put. Sweat popped out along my forehead, and soaked my underarms. I actually made this sound: "DAAARRAARAAARGH!!!" Of course, this was screamed out like a little girl, with tears streaming down my face. I had never been more sure that disaster and, yes, maybe even death was inevitable.  You may assume that my life flashed before my eyes, that I was treated to a kind of going away montage of my greatest hits. That is what people say happens, but it didn't happen to me. I didn't see my parents faces, or the lost loves of my life, or my missed opportunities. All I saw was the rear end of a Mack truck, getting progressively and unavoidably closer. Then again, maybe my life did flash before my eyes and I just didn't notice it. After all, most people don't notice my life. Why should I?  Still, I was not consigned to disaster. I was not going down without a fight. This was not to be the end of James. Oh, no. So, I did the only things I could do: I prayed and I desperately tried the brakes again and again. I pumped those brakes for everything they were worth. Trust me, you could watch all the porn in the world and not see pumping as vigorous or hard as this. I hit those brakes with everything I had and prayed that somewhere, some how, my car had some residual memory of stopping, that there was just one more stop left in the old girl.  I kept pressing harder and harder, until I thought that my foot would burst through the floor and drag along the pavement. Even then I would have remained pressing for dear life. Finally, a miracle happened. As I pressed harder, the car actually began to slow down, and not just from coasting. Somewhere, brakes were causing friction. I was slowing down. Joy of joys, thank you Jesus, I was slowing down. I was actually coming to a stop. I was going to survive. I was going to live. Of course, the braking power was pretty bad. I would still probably hit the truck.  But no, with my new confidence. I had the wherewithal to turn myself onto the shoulder of the road completely avoiding disaster. Then, the light changed. The truck moved and I ever so carefully - never driving above 3 m.p.h - I was able to guide my wearied vessel into a parking lot to safety.  The emergency had passed. I was safe. I was alive. Nothing bad had happened at all. I felt like dancing. I felt like singing. I felt like bursting out of my car and hugging and kissing every person - or any hot girls at least - in sight. Now safe, I felt life rush back into me. I had come so close to death, to tragedy, and I had avoided it by the narrowest of margins. I did the only thing I could do. I curled up into the fetal position and began sucking my thumb. After all, this really was quite a bit for my milquetoast soul to handle.  Now, I could go on. I could tell you about the time spent in the parking lot stretched out on the hood waiting for AAA. I could tell you about Dave - the less than talkative flatbed driver. I could tell you how this caused yet another unforeseen charge to my already overused credit card. I could tell about all of this, but that is only the mundane shell, the ordinary part of this extraordinary adventure. I have ordinary adventures every day, and so do you. So, I'm simply going to leave it to the extraordinary today. Who knows when I'll have this opportunity again? Plus, 'Boy Meets World' is on.  Shalom

      Why does every computer come with solitaire? This is an evil, evil thing. Solitaire is a deceivingly simple game. And you think you can win all the time. I usually play until I win. This being the case, I often end up playing for hours! Hours! I could be writing the great American novel, but instead I am moving cards from one pile to another. Not even real cards but pictures of cards. It's not like I have nothing better to do. (Well, that's not always the case.)  I have had problems in the past with gaming. It tends to take up a lot of my time. But it's a cheap addiction. I usually play some video game every day. I'd say on average I do 45 minutes a day on one of my game systems or my computer. While on my computer, I can do other things like surf the net, chat with friends, or actual work. But I realize that this vice is a cheap one. I figure I spend about $20 a month on this habit. When I went to Dave and Buster's a lot, it was probably twice that, but seeing as I'm close to broke that has stopped. It's way cheaper than cigarettes which is like $4 a pack now. It's even cheaper than buying a bottle of wine a week. Something else I wish I could do. And it's absolutely cheaper than whoring. They cost way too much for me. And they risk of disease and the pending medical bills from that is far more than I'm willing to spend. So video games is a good vice for me. It's controllable.  The real problem is time. I have been a little late for work more than once cause I had to finish a game or get to a save spot. And the days in middle school when I was constantly hollered at for being late for the dinner table for similar reasons. But those were the days when you had to pause the game and go eat and come back. And God forbid something bump that nintendo. I wanted to kill the dog more than once for that.  The other night I was tired and had to get something off my computer around about 11 PM. I began talking to Mike a little, and then I opened the solitaire game. Bad move. I like the Spider Solitaire which most people shy away from cause it's complex and stategy out the wazoo not unlike high level chess. And I don't mess around with the one or two suit games. It's four suit or nothing. The game is hard, but I can usually beat it in a few tries.  Well, it got to be 11:30, I had to work at 8 AM the next morning and I had a long day. My eyelids were dropping. I was fallign asleep and my hand was still moving the mouse to move the cards. What the hell is wrong with me? I was falling asleep and I could not stop playing a dumb inconsequential card game! I was fighting sleep to try and win a card game. I just wanted to win. I just wanted it more than sleep.  I'll have to reset my values: 1. Food 2. Sleep 3. Women 4. Video games Okay that's better.  I'm going to get off the computer and shut off the solitaire. I mean I borrowed two games and I need to play them.

      Now, I'm sure that no one - not even members of my own family - cares about this, but I just want everyone to know that I have a particular soft spot in my heart and upon my palette for fortune cookies. Even though I can hear everyone yawning at their computer monitors, I am going to proceed to praise the fortune cookie. I know it's an odd, not too mention a rather random thing to write about - especially considering that I haven't had Chinese in quite some time. I just like fortune cookies. I like the idea of a food that really says something. I like breaking things open only to find a special surprise. That's wonderful reinforcement for many of my more destructive desires. As a matter of fact I wish more things were like fortune cookies, and could be destroyed only to gather some greater wisdom. Wouldn't it be wonderful if Ming vases or Faberge eggs also contained notes or prizes inside. Wouldn't you just love to smash a priceless work of art to the ground only to find a little slip of paper with a message which automatically becomes hilarious once the words 'in bed' are amended to it?  More than just the hidden prize qualities of fortune cookies, I actually really like their taste. I don't think enough people really think about eating fortune cookies. Everyone gets caught up in the breaking and reading, the actually eating of the fortune cookie often becomes a secondary concern. Eating the cookie is seen more as a neat way to dispose of refuse than something to be truly enjoyed. But next time you break apart one of these culinary mystery boxes, I want you too actually pay attention to eating it. I want you to enjoy the crunch, savor the delicate flavor. For me, this flavor will be forever linked to the late evening Chinese food that would be delivered in the college dorm. It's just wonderful.  Despite all of this, there is, alas, one thing which can ruin the whole fortune cookie experience: not getting a fortune. You may know what I am talking about. Sometimes you don't get a true fortune. Sometimes instead of getting a real fortune, a glimpse into your future - something like, 'You will undertake a great journey' - you get a piece of advice, a goofy aphorism - such as, 'A man of wisdom is of great value'. Personally, I don't want to be lectured by my fortune cookies. I don't want to learn great life lessons. I want to know what's going to happen. I want a real fortune.  Sadly, I fear these aphorisms are becoming more and more prevalent in fortune cookies. They are watering down the whole fortune cookie experience. They take away all the mystery of fortune cookies. They turn magic into morality lessons. Plus, they really suck for adding 'in bed'. In short, the aphorism fortune cookie message must be stopped. It's time for some one with a bold vision to step up to the fortune cookie plate and put an end to this madness. That's right, you guessed it, I want to write fortune cookie messages.  While this may seem like a fairly easy task. 'Any one,' you may say to yourself 'can write vague generalizations about the future.' That is why I do not plan to be vague. I am going to be deadly specific. I feel this is a fantastic way to combat the growing wishy-washiness of the current fortune cookie environment. I also think they're much funnier this way. So now, without further ado, I present you with some of my test fortune cookie fortunes.  'You are not going to score with your current date'  'Before midnight of this coming Tuesday you will find a priceless jewel in the restroom of a Greyhound station'  'You will be shot in the back of the head at a 7-11 while buying milk which is one day away from expiring'  'You will cut your toe-nails on Thursday, 10-ish, when you want to wear sandals but realize that you have disgusting toe-nails'  'Look to your left, look to your right. The person who's going to give you herpes is certainly in sight'  'You will call off work because you get really caught up in a lame VH1 countdown show. You will vehemently deny this, but your cover will be blown when accidentally mention that you think "The Final Countdown" by Europe is actually a rocking song despite it's place on the worst songs of all time list'  'The Canadian government will bug your phones and follow your every step simply because they can and they know no one is going to believe you'  'Suddenly, at the age of 78, you will realize that your whole life has been nothing but a sham. You have denied your dreams for too long, but now you are going to finally follow your dreams of becoming a world-renown tap dancer. You will follow your dreams by enrolling in a Performing Arts high school much like the one in the film Fame. While there you will fall in love with an instructor. However, knowing that your love is illicit and can never come to fruition, you sublimate all your feelings into your dancing. You dance like you've never danced before, because you haven't. Finally, on the day of the big all school talent show, you confess your feelings to the instructor. The instructor admits that he/she shares your feelings. With your heart full of requited love, you go on to give the most astounding performance the school has ever seen. After all the school has never seen a 78 year old freshman. After the talent show, a Broadway scout approaches you and offers you a part in the chorus in an upcoming big, Broadway musical. You accept. On the eve of the musicals big opening, the star breaks his/her leg. The crusty, but lovable, director chooses you from among the chorus to fill in. You succeed brilliantly. All the reviews gush about you. That evening you will die quietly in your sleep in bed.'  Now, that's what I call a fortune.  Shalom

      I don't know who Allen Jacobs is, but it would be much appreciated if he were to stop using my e-mail address when signing on-line petitions. You see, just the other day I noticed something distinctly odd amongst the penis enlargement and home loan advertisements in my E-mail folder. There was a message entitled, "petition signature confirmed - I'm With Busey". This sent up a red flag in my head. Are they talking, I thought to myself, about that stupid reality show with Gary Busey and that guy who claimed to be a comedy writer even though he showed no sign of a working sense of humor? And, by the way, I have no idea why I use the 'they' pronoun, I guess I like to think of a vast underground network of people filling my inbox, instead of single, solitary nerds. Anyway, with my curiosity sufficiently piqued I opened the e-mail, and to my abject horror discovered that someone, this so-called 'Allen Jacobs', has signed, using my e-mail address, a petition to bring back the show 'I'm With Busey'.  I was truly horrified. Trust me if 'I'm With Busey' makes it back on the air, I had nothing to do with it. I'm absolving myself of all guilt right now. It was all a horrible, horrible mistake. Whoever this Allen Jacobs is must have mistyped his e-mail address and come up with mine. Please, you have to believe me. I don't want 'I'm With Busey' back on the air. I would never knowing aid in unleashing such a devastating evil onto the world. I mean, this blog is bad enough, but, then again, I'm pretty much convinced no one reads this, so there's no harm here.  Eventually, after much renting of clothes and gnashing of teeth, I calmed down and became quite curious. What is this petition? Where'd it come from? Are people actually signing this thing? Shouldn't Gary Busey be dead by now anyway? So, I read the entire e-mail message and found that the petition - and the e-mail - originated from PetitionOnline.com. So went to the sight and found the Busey petition. Apparently 'I'm With Busey' has - had? - fans, and they cannot imagine why this "innovative and creative" show would be canceled by Comedy Central "without any given reason." Apparently, these people are unfamiliar with a little thing I like to call the Nielson television ratings.  Sufficiently satisfied the 'I'm with Busey' petition was mostly harmless, I decided to explore the site a little fuller. Let me tell you, a whole world opened up before my eyes. A world populated by obsessive dorks and losers with too much time on their hands and internet access. I felt right at home. People have petitions for everything. Some of them even made bringing back 'I'm with Busey' seem like a good idea. Why would anyone in his right mind sign a petition to keep 'On Air with Ryan Seacrest' true to its name? And that's not a rhetorical question. I really want to know. If you can fill me in, please do.  There are a lot of odd petitions. Most of them having to do with bringing back canceled shows on sci-fi and stuff having to do with video games - which gives you a pretty good idea who the average users are. Mixed in amongst these typical internet type concerns where things such as a petition to prove that someone's ex boyfriend is a real 'Dick Eating Dick Face' and someone who desperately wants to see Bob's Big Boy make a comeback in the worse possible way - although, I'm pretty sure, Big Boy can't come back any other way. There was one really quaint petition entitled 'Stop the Hate' which was obviously posted by some well meaning, but utterly clueless liberal teenager. This ranks right up there with putting those stickers that say 'hating' at the bottom of stop signs. Sure, it's a swell message and all, but it doesn't really do anything but help the person who put it up feel good about himself. It's not as though a Klansman is going drive by one of those stop signs or see a petition against hate and all of a sudden clap his palm to his forehead exclaiming, "Stop hating, why didn't I think of that" - but then again I didn't actually look at the petition, just the name, it could be quite different from what I expect.  Now, here's the part which really got me thinking. PetitionOnline.com bills itself as 'a premiere free speech forum.' While I agree that free speech is one of the most important rights reserved for us in the constitution, and that this site is certainly a forum for free speech, I would be a little wary about calling it premiere. Now, maybe the PetitionOnline creators started with noble causes, to, say, petition the government - which is expressly protected by the 1st amendment - but when the founding fathers added the first amendment I'm sure creating a petition to get a lame TV show back on the air wasn't high on their minds. I'm not saying that they'd be against it, but if they knew that people where using free speech to save 'I'm with Busey', they would most likely answer with a yawn - of course you'd first have to explain television to them and then give them some sort of idea what Gary Busey's like and then describe the show to them. "By Gum," they may say, "Sure we fought for freedom of speech, and your silly little petitions are cute and all, but doesn't anyone have anything real to say? Aggrievments to the government perhaps?" People fought and died for serious issues, not so some moron could sign a petition as 'BUTTSEX' - the same person listed his location as 'BUTTSEX' and left, as a comment, 'No, seriously, I like BUTTSEX'.  It just seems that people use the term freedom of speech too loosely anymore. I don't think anyone should even mention it until they are seriously being quieted by the government. I'm tired of hearing people whine about freedom of speech because no one wants to listen to them. You're guaranteed the freedom to express, but not the right to a major forum or a willing audience. Although if there's one thing I've learned from OnlinePetition.com, no matter how lame an opinion you have, some idiots are going to be with you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm bringing back 'Who's the Boss'.  Shalom
