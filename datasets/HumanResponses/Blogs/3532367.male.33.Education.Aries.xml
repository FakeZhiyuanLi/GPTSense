      We went to see the girls get their awards tonight from their Club. It was good to see their hard work get rewarded by the presentation of badges and certificates. They had good fun and it's given them a late night. We are all pretty much shattered, me especially and I could do with some decent sleep.

      Well as I type, there are big arguments going on in the office about annual leave. It doesn't effect me directly as I booked mine earlier in the year, but I really feel for the guy who it does effect. The atmosphere at the moment is painfully tense and after having no sleep, its quite difficult to cope with. Unfortunately, "new" rules were brought in at the beginning of the year. The only problem is, no-one consulted us and they are only local (effecting only our department).

      I had half a day annual leave yesterday to attend a meeting in Stafford about computer strategies. Following that I went straight to football practise, then once home, it was time for tea and housegroup. Busy, busy, busy.  By 22:00, I was totally shattered and went to bed looking forward to getting loads of sleep. How wrong I was - another night of disturbed sleep. It's not because I'm lying awake thinking about things though. I just can't sleep. I'm sure it's to do with the medication, but the doctor won't give me anything at this stage, preferring to get me to exercise. The theory is all well and good, but today I am totally shattered and can't concentrate on my work at all....Oh well!

      Morning world! And what a beautiful day it is today!  Yes you are right, it is 05:00. I woke at midnight, 02:00, 02:30 and 04:00. Don't know why. By 04:30 I decided enough was enough and I ventured out for my first 'morning' run. While I was getting changed, Sandra woke and asked what I was doing. I told her I was going for a run....unless she wanted sex. She was silent and I took that to be a "no"!  I jogged up to the local football pitch and did a couple of circuits, with short bursts of "running", before jogging back. Half an hour in total, but more than enough for me to experience bursting lungs, aching legs and a sweaty back....nice.  And just to prove the point, I decided to blog it now, rather than later ;-) I dont feel tired though....

      I got paid today, so I have given Sandra details of how to access my accounts and what money to move where so that the bills are paid. The money hasn't come through from the bank yet, but we seem to be coping quite well financially at the moment (either that or the pressure has been taken off me by Sandra looking after the finances).

      I managed to get the car serviced tonight. Changed the oil, plugs, filters and rocker cover gasket. It took the best part of an hour and it went quite smoothly. I feel a lot happier now that it's out of the way and I have more of an idea of the state of the engine. The parts cost 33 UKP and Sandra is due to pay for those tomorrow.

      I've made a conscious decision to avoid Sharon. I've put her number on ignore and her messenger and email on block. I've got nothing against her on a personal level, I just need to avoid creating further damage to myself and my family.  I don't really know what is worse - having sex with someone else behind Sandra's back, just for the sake of "needing" a sexual high or continuing in the same manner as we are with each other. I've chosen at the moment to remove the third party. Let's see if I can stick to it.

      Today seems to be going so slowly. I got in a bit late due to heavy traffic, I've already eaten most of my lunch, even though I had breakfast before I came out (which is unusual for me). I would just rather be somewhere else, but I suppose most people feel like that when they are at work.

      What a great afternoon - not!   We took the kids on a bike ride, after loads of nagging from them. We literally got half way down the hill and my youngest daughter fell off. Fortunately, she had a helmet on but she was badly damaged on her hands, chest and face. A passer-by gave us a lift back, by putting the bikes in his van and taking the casualty home - Sandra went with her. As soon as I had arranged for someone to look after the other kids, we took her to hospital with a suspected broken finger and to get cleaned up.  Fortunately, it transpired that nothing was broken, although she was very sore. The hospital was quite quick, only 2 hours start to finish but by the time we got home it was raining, so the idea of a b-b-q had to go out of the window.... we settled for a chinese instead.

      The buyer came to collect my ebay item at lunchtime. Lovely lady, paid in cash and I gave the 25 UKP straight to Sandra for her to put towards the parts for my car service (due to pick up parts on Monday). The kids want to go on a bike ride this afternoon (I feel knackered already!)

      Well I started off this morning with a 13 mile bike ride. I really enjoyed it as the weather was great. Sandra had sent me out as I had started to pester after she had woken up. We had had sex the night before (usual routine on a towel) but she seemed more accepting of it, although again I had felt pressured to go ahead. We finally went to sleep at about 01:00, but I was awake again at 04:00 and couldn't really get back to sleep. It was very difficult trying to keep to myself, but I couldn't get myself up and out of bed to start any execrcise either.  When I got back from cycling, it was time for the chores - a little vaccuming and time out to mow the lawns. Just before lunch, we had a cuddle and I ended up undressing Sandra, but stopped short of full sex. I decided to distract myself with a little more gardening and Sandra came out and helped me.

      Sandra suggested we went out for a meal tonight. After some discussion we settled on a place, where we thought the prices would be reasonable. It was the first time we had been to a "Harvester" pub, but we really enjoyed the layout and the food. We had a really good time and for less than 25 quid all in. Sandra said that we should put it on my card for now, which I did.  On the way back, Sandra said she wanted to do the food shopping. I had my reservations, but she was understanding to a point and offered to drop me off at home. We discussed it further and I said that I would have to face up to it at some point. I got a couple of things on 3 for 2 offers, but Sandra seemed to be OK with them.

      After having dropped the girls off so that they could go on their organised day trip, I went down to the bank to pay some of my Saturday job money into the savings account - along with the refund, I am now back over the 1000 UKP mark.  Next up was the cycle shop - it was open, they fixed my gears while I waited and charged me 4 quid! Bargain! Even if he did close early on me yesterday.   From there I got home and found the batteries had gone flat in a piece of equipment I use. I asked Sandra if she would fetch some for me as I had to be out in 30 mins and still needed to get changed - she agreed. 40 minutes later, still no sign of Sandra. I told my son to jump in the car and phoned work to ask them to cover me as I would be 15 minutes late. Half way to work, the phone goes, it's Sandra "where are you?" she enquires. I tell her how I needed to get off and that she would need to come and get Rob off me. She slammed the phone down.  I arrived at work 15 minutes late, there was cover, but everything was OK. 15 minutes later Sandra turned up, handed me the batteries and took Rob home, without muttering a word.   Now I felt like the one who had been put out, I was OK about everything (even though I was flustered, I wasn't angry or 'down') yet it was Sandra that was in the mood - why? OK she went out for me, but knew what time she had to be back - she had gone in plenty of time and should have done it easily.  Nevertheless, I have come back to an empty house, which means I can't go out and get the parts for my car service, as I have asked Sandra to only give me cash for things. As she is not here I have no money, and the shop closes in 30 mins....

      Good news and bad news from the postman today. First I got a refund from a finance company I have paid off. Just under 90 UKP (I had paid them to close the account, then they took the monthly direct debit as well).   The bad news was the insurance company had charged me twice (once by card on the phone and once by direct debit) for the changes following the change of cars. Oh well, I suppose another phone call will resolve that one - its just a hassle.

      Well I started off well. Got home and jumped on the bike to take it down the shop to get the gears repaired (in preperation for my exercise routine set by the doctor). I got to the cycle shop at 16:50 and it had shut - everything had been put away and there were still 10 minutes to closing time! Bastard!  Decided then it would be best not to waste the opportunity and took off down the canals - with only 6 of 21 gears working, pedalling like a mad man. Half way round, would you just know it, I got a thorn in my tyre. It had gone all the way through. I decided the best option was to leave it in so that it acted like a plug. It seemed to work, I completed the 9.5 miles without much problem and even decided to come home a different route so that I got more hills! The puncture was fixed in a couple of minutes once I had got home and the whole adventure from start to finish took less than an hour. All in all I am quite pleased with myself.

      I've told Sandra I would like to service my car this weekend. It's been standing with the previous owner and the oil has congealed at the top of the rocker cover. I asked her if she would ask her Dad if I could do it there, as it's flat and he has a bigger tool kit than me. I've also indicated that I want to get my push bike in to get the gear cable fixed. I've estimated 25 UKP for the car and 25 UKP for the bike. I am hoping she will come with me to pay so that I don't have an opportunity to deceive her.  I finish early on Friday's so I am hoping to get the bike up this afternoon as part of my exercise therapy. It's about 2 miles away, so if the weather stays nice, I might go in shorts and try to jog back - LOL

      Well it didn't really seem to work. When I got into bed, Sandra offered me sex on the same basis as last night. I refused, she pushed and I refused again. It would have been so easy, but I knew there would have been a low on the other side of it.  I woke at 02:30 and again at 04:00 and again at 06:00, but I was not awake enough, so there was no way I was going to get up and go for a run. At 06:00 I started to give her cuddles and hugs which inevitably led to me trying it on, which she rebuffed. I recognised what I was doing, apologised and tried to remind her that I was trying, but it was hard for me. When we got up, I asked if she had slept OK, she said not that well and returned the question. When I told her I had woken several times, her response was "well I gave you the opportunity".....Aarrgh!  Sandra thinks I am using the depression label as an excuse for all of my problems, sometimes she almost seems jealous that I am getting help and she isn't, but she won't do anything about it.

      Having watched England lose on penalties and with a load of pent up frustration I asked Sandra if we could have a cuddle when we went to bed. I got the "do what you feel you need to do" response. I said no and I didn't want it to be like that, to which she replied "the damage is done, its not repairable any more".  I decided to go for a bike ride. Texted a friend who said he would come, then decided he had no lights. I did nearly 4 miles - flat out, on hilly terrain. I am totally unfit and hate exercise of any kind so it was a feat in itself.   On the way back all I could think of was cuddling up to Sandra in bed, so on the last hill home (a big climb) I really worked it hard. I am at the point now that I can't type straight, I am sweating profusly and feel unco-ordinated. I hope it bloody works!

      Another of those questions off the doctor and one which perhaps goes someway to answering comments. When I feel bad about something I've done, does it have a stronger feeling than the high?  Well at the moment no, the high lasts for longer and is more powerful, whilst the low is very intense but may only last a couple of minutes - usually while admitting to it!!!!   Take the speakers, every time I get in the car I get a high from the music they produce as a good sharp, clear sound. That is more frequent than the low I got from hiding the boxes in the dustbin or admitting my actions to the doctor. Also the high was experienced both before and after the low and thus cancelled out the feeling of being low - does that make sense?   Sex with Sharon was the same, I was OK at the time, OK after, but felt bad when admitting it to the blog or doctor, but OK again next time I spoke to her on chat.

      Today I told a friend at work about the existence of the blog. I needed some feedback on how others interpreted my problems. Lets face it, the anonymity of typing it out to a website is a damned site easier than sitting face to face telling someone. They were really good about it and it was nice to get the thoughts from an "outside" source.   I also got my first comment today - horray! It's really important to me to know that people are out there who feel the same, or are able to share experiences in this way. It makes me realise I'm not alone and I am very grateful to everyone who feels able to comment.

      Well first the good news - I can have a drink (upto 2 pints) anything more will react with my medication.  The rest of the appointment was really stressful, I was the last to go in and spent a good 40 minutes with the doctor. I confessed to everything, from the nose bleeds, not sleeping, feeling down and angry, to eating, spending 120 quid when i only went out for 20 quid speakers, having sex with strangers off websites and sexually abusing my wife.  She phoned through a counseling appointment while I was there and told me that I am now identifying things as being wrong, so that is a sign of getting better. I have 2 months supply of tablets and will be on them for "a long time to come" and have to see her again in a month.  Her suggestion to when I am feeling out of sorts (or not able to sleep) is to exercise - run, walk, cycle - anything to increase my endorphines, even if its the middle of the night!!! She said no to sleeping aids at this stage. She also said that this is what I should have done instead of registering for the dating website.   I should also confess to Sandra about the true cost of my spending for speakers in order to humiliate myself and to go out only with cash, not cards.  Her concern with the marriage is Sandra's refusal to see Relate. She said I should try and mention it again and if Sandra was not in agreement then it must be that deep down, she may really want a divorce. In her words "you are trying really hard, your wife needs to put something into it as well", "the lines of communication need to be re-established". She also suggested that Sandra may well know about my sexual activities and has chosen to ignore them for the sake of the kids - something I have not contemplated before. Sandra's last response to me mentioning Relate was "It's you with the problem don't bring me into it again" - basically she is scared of opening out to a stranger about her intimate feelings, and I am scared of asking her again.

      Help!   I've got Sharon on Messenger offering me a blowjob tonight while watching the football - every mans dream she says. Too damned right! But I can't, I shouldn't - how do I put her off? Do I want to put her off? Sandra never gives blowjobs, she hates it! What do I do?   It's not as if I even have feelings for Sharon, I don't care about her, I don't even fancy her, its purely a sexual release, like a prostitute but without having to pay. That seems to make it even worse - socially unacceptable, but a requirement, a craving that I need to "feel" better.

      I'm still not sleeping, I've woken every day at 01:00 and 04:00. I've got the doctors today so I must remember to ask for some help.  I've got mixed emotions from last night, Sandra got into bed and said "right lets get it over with then" (referring to sex). I told her I didn't want it to be like this but she insisted saying "come on, then you can leave me alone." She pulled down her night clothes and lay a towel on the freshly made bed and lay there. I wasn't allowed to touch or kiss and when we had finished she got up and had a shower. I know I have used her and she probably feels like she has been raped, but despite the situation I just couldn't say no!  I know there is something seriously wrong with me to feel like this and treat the preson I love the way I do, but I can't stop it and I am getting increasingly worried about it - I need help!

      Sandra is trying to be very supportive tonight. She knows how bad my day has been and has asked me if there is anything she can do to help. We discussed several things about the day, looking at it from different angles. I have asked if we can make love tonight, but so far no answer.

      My boss, has hinted that he needs to do my return to work interview. I have requested someone else does it as I feel he does not beleive I was legitimately off. He has referred it to his boss but the request was turned down on the basis of it just being office banter! I started to write a complaint, but he aplologised, which meant I had to hold onto it, instead of submitting it.

      Oh my God this is SHIT! I've had nothing but sarcastic comments from my manager about being off. He's been trying to make out that I've not been ill but have been doing my car (I'm not going to tell him am I!).  I've had to walk out of the office to escape the atmosphere. I called Sandra almost in tears and it's really getting too much for me. She suggested I talk to Dave, who knows my predicament at the moment. Dave took me for a walk for an hour while we discussed my boss and God and it gave me the chance to calm down. Dave is a Christian and has also worked with my boss and knows what he can be like.  The end result is a headache that is splitting me in two - I can't concentrate.

      I arranged with a friend to drop off my old car this afternoon. I took it down to the auction rooms and they had it off me within 20 mins. I was quite happy as they didn't do an inspection that I could witness, so if I get a bill later on to say this and that "this was wrong and that was wrong" I can say I don't agree! Daft or what?

      I've fitted my amp in the boot and we have sound! I've hidden the boxes in the bin so that Sandra doesn't find out - silly or what, I'll have to tell her eventually. I've spent the morning, cutting out 3 huge holes in the parcel shelf for two 6"x9" speakers and a 10" sub woofer.   I had to take some medicine into school during lunch for my son, who claimed he had a headache too. It gave me an opportunity to see how the new lunch system was going and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. I couldn't get over how quiet it seemed to be.

      Decided to follow up my day off with another one. This will allow me to sort out my new car and get the old one ready for handing back. I went to the local car spares place to find speakers, and air freshener and a rear eye level brake light. I ended up with speaker, air freshener and a 300W amplifier. I just coudn't help myself - not a good start, the first sign of any money and it's gone.

      Yes! good result for the boys today, with a 4-2 win over Croatia. Defence is appauling, but Rooney is the wonder boy up front. I would love to be able to have a drink though. It's the first time we've got past the group stages while playing on foreign soil.

      Went into work this morning, for a couple of hours. Sharon was chatting to me on messenger and I decided I would be better off meeting her, so I claimed a headache/migrane and left on sick leave. Got the money out of the bank for my car on the way home and went over to pick Sharon up. The date started off OK, we talked while walking in a local park, then went back to her house as a storm brewed up. We finished up going upstairs and having sex in her bedroom for 2 hours.

      Today we skipped church in favour of celebrating fathers day. Got some nice presents off the kids - England tshirts and shorts. Popped over to see my Dad, who was well considering and the kids enjoyed seeing him. We also visited Sandra's Dad on the way back. During the afternoon we all went for a cycle ride down the canal's - my bike lost its gear cable, but we managed. Tea was great - roast beef and ice-cream. The evening was frustrating, as I thought Sandra and I might have a night cuddled up, but it didn't happen.

      Strange day today. This morning we finalised the re-mortgage. After work I was due to meet a girl (Sharon) from the internet dating site, but I cancelled in favour of looking at cars. I found one eventually, after being held up by roads being closed due to a major fire and getting involved with a road traffic accident - a boy had been run over on his bike, while trying to cross the road. He was fine, but abusive to everyone in sight, including the Asian lady involved and another witness. Anyway, I put 100 UKP down as a deposit after settling on an 1994 Fiesta from a very nice couple as it had only dome 37000 miles and seemes a genuine car.

      Last night was like a rollercoaster ride. Got home annoyed at having effectively missed the first half of the football, due to helpful colleagues making me work the late shift. We won, but not having played the best. Sandra was in a good mood, we cuddled up and had a hug and the kids went to bed early, things felt good.   Then it all went wrong - a door slammed in the wind, knocking a cross-stich picture off the bookcase, the glass broke. The kids got it in the neck for messing around (they weren't) and having a messy room (it was) and I got it in the neck for not having hung the picture properly. The kids were made to get out of bed and tidy, which they did for an hour, going to sleep themselves at exactly 21:00 (the time I had told them to stop) - they were golden.  Sandra didn't speak for the rest of the night and went to bed early, still in a mood, having said she lives in a hell hole, where no-one cares. She still won't go to a doctor.  My reaction? I stole the details off a credit card that was lying around and registered on a dating website! A 'double whammy' straight for the 2 things that I use to make me happy - spending and sex! What made it worse, was that this time I knew I was doing it - and why, but it didn't stop me.

      Sandra's had the day off work today (headache). I said she would pick a day I can't have off (because of the England match, it would look too obvious) but I had to ring in for her. I was up at 04:00 again last night so I could have done with the time off to catch up with sleep.   I filled the car with petrol this morning, went to pay and realised I didn't have any cards with me - oops!. Left my driving license with the lady behind the till, then got Sandra's cashpoint card from home to pay for it. Made me late for work, but the woman was OK with it.  I work with 3 other people, non are English, non are into football (soccer), but they are all going home early at 16:00 to watch the game while I have to stop late to cover the office - where is the justice in that?

      The mortgage offer arrived today and everything seems to have gone through OK. It says they will NOT allow any further second interests (secured loans) on the property - Yipee!  We are going to get a friend to go over the paperwork with us as its a bit confusing with the terminology. The total amouont of the loan (including our existing mortgage is 135,000 UKP! Frightening really. I've still not heard off the counselor which is worrying me slightly. Still I will chase it up with the doctor when I see her next.

      Paul took to trying to ring Sandra on her mobile this afternoon. She ignored the calls but got all the messages! In the end she sent a text to Jill, who didn't realise Paul had been in contact again. The girls seem more settled at the moment, so it may have broken the ice, although Sandra says they will never be friends again.

      Sandra keeps getting text messaages from Paul, the husband of a former friend - (Jill and Sandra had an argument after she used Sandra as an excuse for her and Paul splitting up). They are both back together and have just returned from 2 weeks holiday, but now Sandra has had a series of texts from Paul saying he has missed her and can't get her out of his head!!!!  There is absolutely nothing in it from Sandra's point of view, although she is gullable, she was just a shoulder to cry on while he was going through a rough time. There is no doubt in my mind though that Paul fancies Sandra and would like to sleep with her.

      Still feeling hungry although sleep levels were high last night - thank God! Still not heard off the car dealer though and having rung after him, it seems he is off on leave today. I need to get the cancellation confirmed so that I can buy a cheap car, preferrably for the weekend. I've got to work on Saturday too, so it should be a busy time.  I feel better within myself over the last couple of days, although I have a boss who moans when I get into work 15 minutes early (thats got to be a first!). I try to explain that I travel 18 miles down motorways, through 3 sets of roadworks at rush hour - some days I may be early, some days I may be held up - its just the way it goes, but he just doesn't seem to get it! He never used to moan when his mate stopped over an hour later until 6pm everyday because he arrived and hour late after taking his kids to school.

      At least I managed to get some sleep last night. I woke at around 01:00 and 04;00 again, but it was better than the night before. I feel al little more relaxed although I've not heard anything from the dealer about cancelling the car order (despite chasing him up yesterday). I've started the second hand search again and found a Proton Compact, Vauxhall Corsa, Toyota Celica and a Rover 200 - what a mix!  I should have a fairly busy day today, what with work and a school meeting to attend this afternoon - and I've got to make an appointment for the doctor for next Friday too. I've been feeling hungry today again - eaten most of my lunch already.

            I phoned the dealer up this morning about cancelling the car. I told him the position I am in and he said to leave it with him as his manager isn't in until later today, but he couldn't see it being a problem. I am still really worried though. I've been having nose bleeds all day. One minute I am sitting at my desk, the next it just starts pouring! I have a headache and blurred vision too (although I think that is down to looking at the screen too long on my PC).

            Another night of no sleep, I spent the whole night worrying. I really think I've done the wrong thing with the car, despite Sandra's blessing. I am going to ring up today and try to get it cancelled. I've even phoned the man up with the old Clio for sale (the one I saw on Friday that was tidy but was too basic), it's still available. I just hope I can cancel OK, the terms and conditions don't read well, but when does small print ever make sense? I've worked myself into a panic and now I am scared.

            Sunday morning started well too, lovely sunny day and we all went out together as a family. After lunch, I asked Sandra if we should test drive one of the Clio's I had seen from the day before. She agreed and off we all trooped. The first one was a diesel - nice car but the salesman was well dodgy and rude to Sandra so we bunked off - after he had given me figures that were 10 UKP a month higher than what he had quoted the day before. We went along to another dealership. They didn't have a diesel, but did have 5 years interest free. The only problem is the deposit was 2345 and 99 pounds a month. Sandra and I discussed it and surprisingly she said we could afford it, so we signed up.

            Better late then never. Spent friday lunch and after work looking at cars - one was very nice but basic spec, (not even PAS). Later on I helped a mate move his freezer, washing machine and bits back into his kitchen, after havinig a new floor laid.  Saturday was fine, spent the morning looking at cars - none to my liking. Came up with the idea of going for a slightly better model by going for a newer used car via a dealer. I thought that with a deposit of 1500 I would be ok aiming for 50 quid a month. Found a nice couple of Clio's - over budget though. Took the family out for a cycle ride in the afternoon, along the canal, which the kids, Sandra and I enjoyed. Later in the evening we went over to some friends for a meal. Enjoyed the evening, even though I had to go tea-total. I joked with Sandra about having skipped the main course (there wasn't that much and we both thought it was the starter).

      Last night was hell. Hardly slept at all. Woke up at 01:00 and couldn't get settled back to sleep all night. It was really difficult trying to keep my hands off Sandra, but I managed it. We had discussed it earlier in the day and she said that it was due to time of day - morning too busy, evening too tired. I tried to ask her if we could have an early night, she said "don't know" which is her way of agreeing, without saying so. But by the time we got settled down it was 22:00 and she said she was too tired again and her peroid had started.   That just led to frustration and anger on my behalf, although I also felt vunerable - I think that this was down to me recongising for the first time that this was one of my problem areas. I was very aware of my reaction to being denied the "chemical highs" the doctor had been on about and was ashamed of it in a way.

      I viewed another couple of cars on the way into work this morning. One was supposed to be a private sale, but when I got there it turned out to be a scrap dealer with 6 cars for sale - all insurance write-offs. I'm going to look at another at lunch with Sandra. She's off today and has just had her haircut, it sounds really nice - the first time she has been happy with it for a long, long time. She asked to meet me at lunch, so I presume she want to show it off.

            I had a look at some brand new cars on finance yesterday. It seems I could get quite a few for under the '100 quid a month' mark - Citroen, Renault, Hyundai&#8230;.But is that what I want? I don&#8217;t know!       Rang up a chap about a Clio - he wanted 1350, but I said I would offer him 1000 (no tax and solid colour, slightly over priced) - he said no! Another had his car on auction for 1500, with no reserve and only 1 day left. I said I would travel the 80 miles with the cash, and pay the full amount without haggling, if the test drive was OK. He called me a &quot;tssr!&quot;&#8230;.and his auction closed without selling.      I'll take a look at another second hand one at lunch. I've got to go into town this lunchtime, to renew my season ticket for the football team I support (the one luxury I was allowed, if I could save for it in time). I've decided that if I put the season ticket on a card, I can gain interest on my money in the bank, but pay off the amount outstanding interest free when the statement arrives - and it gives me more time to save, thanks to my wages not being there! Again, my Saturday job employer hasn't paid me, so I'm 100 quid down this week (that's twice in the last month that they haven't paid on time).

            Sandra moaned at me again this morning for not helping get the kids to school. I've tried to explain that I owe nearly 3 hours to work, so have to get in early to make the time up. In the next breath she is telling me about school assemblies and sports days - more time off needed! I also have a school meeting next week and I need to get time off for that too. I didn't pester again last night - that&#8217;s twice in a row now - small steps forward from my point of view (expected from Sandra's). I bet reading this back makes me sound like a sex pest!

      Last night was better, woke up around 05:45. I've got to try and motivate myself today to sort out a car, otherwise I'm going to be without transport. Trouble is I dont know whether to use all the money for a half decent car for 1500 or just go for a "runner" at 500 quid.  I need to look at pricing up a couple of projects that I have to do at home. A local organisation want a projector set-up and mounted and a friend of a friend has a PC on XP home that he wants to network! With trying to fit it in everything else I have to think about, its getting a bit awkward, especially with transport doubts.  The worst thing about it is that I wont be paid for either job!

      So much for getting sleep last night. The dog woke me at 01:00 scratching around and howling, while Sandra accidentally woke me at 05:00 when she moved sharply in her sleep. I am the person who can sleep anywhere at anytime - even standing up! It's 08:45, I've been in work for 45 minutes and I am yawning already (and I feel hungry, as the rest of the team eat saussage and egg McMuffin's).

      I hope I manage to get a good nights sleep. What with the heat and the tablets keeping me awake.... I also hope I can manage not to pester Sandra, but in the situation I am in, I need to feel loved and supported and I tend to show that physically, with hugs and affection.

      I phoned up the vehicle auctions today to arrange a suitable date to deliver the car to them for its VT. They said anytime I like - nice response, but has thrown me a bit as I wasn't expecting it. So I've been checking out the car magazines to try and find a replacement for between 1000 and 1500 UKP - why are all the cheap, low mileage cars in Scotland?  Also contacted my credit card company. I have been trying to transfer 300 UKP for the last 2 weeks, to close off 2 store cards. Nothing has gone through though. She tried over the phone, with no joy so I've had to move the money into a bank account to then move it to the store cards.  I will be glad when the mortgage is through and all this lot can be closed off.

      Work is going well at the moment, but all I seem to be doing is eating. I've felt hungry since last night, (I had a couple of bags of crisps after a roast dinner with all the trimmings and pudding!) and I've already eaten half of my lunch - not normally unusual, but since having my medication, I've not felt like the munchies.

      Another 04:00 wake up call. I just couldn't get to sleep again for over an hour, yet when the alarm when off at 06:30 I couldn't get up! Sandra says if I pester her for sex again at 4 in the morning, she will kill me. Typing this I can't say I blame her, but at the time I just can't think like that....why?  Back to work today too - should be fun!

      We needed to go to the local supermarket yesterday. The thought of it actually worried me as my tactic had been one of avoidance. Sandra and I got the things we needed - beer, pop, wine and crisps - to entertain the friends that had given me a lift with my bike. When we came out, I told Sandra that I found it difficult to go shopping in the current situation, knowing that I couldn't spend. I had wanted a CD and if it had been up to me I would have just picked it off the shelf and put it on my card, but as it was, I didn't even mention it. It was something small, but it was still just as hard to "avoid" that section of the shop.  The evening went well, but Icouldn't drink any beer or wine because of my tablets - again a frustration. I don't drink to excess, but like to have a social drink now and then. With Euro 2004 coming up, I am already thinking about what I am going to do when I get asked to watch the match down the pub....

      The bike sale went OK and I now have 1550 UKP towards a small car. The paperwork for the voluntary termination of my existing car has also arrived, so things are beginning to move forwards. When Sandra got home she gave me a newspaper clipping of a dealer advert for a brand new car for 99 UKP per month with 5 years 0% finance. I thought it was a bit naughty of her to "tempt" me with another finance deal, so I asked her if we could afford it. She said we could afford 99 UKP/month once the money had come through from the mortgage. I said I would prefer to put the money in a savings account for a year instead, thus having another 1200 towards a better car next year - she seemed in favour, and I was quite surpised at my excitement at wanting to save.

      Well it's Saturday and I'm off to work - I've taken a part time job to help on the income front. The good news is, it pays 100 UKP, the bad news is, it's only summer work for a few months. Still its helping us get out of a "tight spot". Should be finished by lunch, then I've got to get my bike over to Worcester.  I got an apology this morning from Sandra for her comments to me last night, it helped a little, but I can't help feeling that she meant what she said. Still I am usually good at forgiving people, so it should all be in the past by the end of today.

      We came back from the bike ride fine, everyone on a high having enjoyed themselves, although the kids were tired and hungry.   Vicky, a friend of my wife had asked me if she could take Sandra out tonight, but didn't want me to tell her - a surprise to cheer her up. The problem is when Vicky rang to confirm with Sandra, she said she had already arranged it all with me....needless to say I got both barrels!  "Why didn't you tell me....I don't want to go out....have friends treating me like a charity case....its alright for you you've got the label 'depression"....its not you that wakes up wanting to be dead."  I had wondered how long it would take to be thrown back in my face - 2 days was quicker than I had thought. "You were the one that made me get counseling....if you feel like that you should go to the doctors too" I retorted.  "You weren't supposed to go to a doctor!" came the response, she ignored the part about her going to the doctors.  The whole experience has me feeling as though I have taken another 2 steps backwards. We had been getting on OK for the last few days, making progress, getting a dent in the finances, helping each other through. Now it all seems to have gone again. I feel lost. I feel drained.

      Today I've got a cycle ride planned with the kids (I'm off work this week on leave). Nothing too special but its a case of finding things to do with them, that are cheap but can involve everyone. I've also set things going with the bike. Handover has been arranged for Saturday afternoon, I've been offered a lift back by a good friend and I've spoken to the finance company with regards to paying off the amount outstanding. I've got to put this on a credit card until the mortgage money comes through and put the cash into a savings account to buy a cheap run around car, after mine has been handed back. I still have my car at the moment, but this is in the process of going back to the finance company under their voluntary termination agreement - this is where I have paid more than half of the finance and I can hand the car back without penalty. Unfortunately, I wasnt able to do this with the bike as it was on a loan instead of HP! Something to note for the future.

      Well, having travelled just over 100 miles it looks as though our man is interested in the bike. After a bit of haggling we agreed on a price and he has just phoned to say his bank will have the money ready for him on Saturday - yipee! Fingers crossed it all goes through OK.  Have been getting headaches today, something I dont usually get. I think I had one last night when I went to bed too. I feel tired now, but that is probably due to riding all afternoon - lets hope I manage to get some sleep.

      Just had a call about my bike (its currently up for sale to clear the finance). A chap from Worcester who is interested but has no way of getting over to me, as the person who is giving him a lift won't come this far out (50 miles). For some stupid reason, I said I would take the bike over to him to see it, so I now have a 2-3 hour ride ahead of me and its due to rain. Need to organise kids "babysitting" too.

      Last night was awful. The medication (Fluoxetine 20mg) kept me up all night. I must have literally woken up every 15 minutes, but I dont feel tired now. We had gone to be early - 22:00hrs, together.   To be honest I had hoped we might have intercourse, but we didn't and I lay there trying to go to sleep while making an effort to keep my hands off. I "felt like zebedee" (from the magic roundabout) I could have gone for a 20 mile run. When I did drop off, I was very aware that every time I woke up I turned to my wife for a hug and more often than not tried to fondle her, kiss her or try to get some form of sex from her (I couldn't stop myself) - she must have felt very drained waking up to tell me to "get off" every couple of minutes.

      Having got home a bit flustered, I managed to lock my keys in the garage while putting my bike away (no spare key!) but at least I was in the house. Panic set in because of the way I was thinking, following the events at the doctors. The realisation a doctor thought I had depression was just kicking in......and it was depressing! I found myself thinking of needing a hug from my wife, then questioned whether I was only thinking that because I was low and needed a high.  After an hour or so I rang my mother-in-law (my parents are not supportive), explained what I had done with my keys and told her that I had been to the doctors, got a referral and was on anti-depressants. I wasn't sure what her reaction would be (because I felt I now had this huge label "depression" hanging round my neck) but she was very good about it.  My father-in-law came round and managed to break into the garage - either because of a mis-spent youth or because he was able to put his engineering skills to practice (I don't know which!)  Now the only hurdle was how to tell my wife. This actually proved easier in practise than it did when thinking it over. She is a nurse and has strong beliefs about people with depression. She told me to try not to get hung up on it, or use it as an excuse. The discussions that followed, made me realise that my fear was myself and that my problem was treatable.

      Yesterday morning is where I am going to begin in any detail. I had driven my bike over to the local dealer to get its service done. While waiting, I thought I would ring the GP for an appointment in the hope of getting some information on counseling. I wanted some help to prevent me getting spending impulses and finding anything suitable was proving very difficult. The appointment was set for 10:45 and I eventually got there at 10:55, having waited nearly an hour longer than I was told for my bike.  The GP was great, when I explained to her what I wanted, she said she would need some more background information and proceeded to ask lots of leading questions. The whole thing took over 30 minutes - the longest I've ever been in a doctors surgery (waiting excluded). The outcome was that she thought that I used spending, eating and sexual activity to get my "happy kicks" when feeling low, and if I couldn't get these I would turn to internal frustration and moods instead of external displays of anger and violence. The good news was that I hadn't developed into using alcohol and drugs!  She would refer me to the in-house counselor, who may in turn refer me to someone more specialist - RESULT!  BUT, in the meantime she wanted me to go onto Anti-depressants....Prozac!  "But I'm not depressed" was my immediate reaction and "Anti-depressants have a stigma!"  She calmed me down and said it was either a stigma or getting help. The drugs would help my body with the need for a chemical high, while the counseling would help to re-train my thoughts and approach. The two would work together to reduce my need to spend, eat and have sex.

      Sorry, my language is always the first thing to go when I am stressed. I've had a couple of texts from Angela, but we've not been able to chat because she has gone out for the day with her friend. I feel like I have lost a limb. She says we need to chat ASAP and I agree with her. I just hope so much&nbsp;that it all works out.  I went for a walk at lunch to try and stay awake as I was falling asleep at my desk. When I got back I had a call from my director to go and see the department that were messing me about last week. They had started again, complaining about a problem which it transpires was fixed by an external engineer last week. I asked why they had not said anything about it and was told by the staff they their boss had told them not to tell us. The frustration has compounded and its now taking itself out on my head again.   It hurts. I am so low, so down and things are getting to me so easily. I'm not sure how much longer I can cope.

      That's what I feel inside today. I am waiting, hoping, that Angela will come online. I miss her so much, even though she said she would not log in today. I have not slept at all, I feel totally drained and have been running on reserves for too long now. I need to know she still wants to give us a try. Sorry seems such an inadequate word a times like this, but I am - for lots of reasons.  Can't keep my eyes open....

      Gutted, betrayed, violated, raped, unclean. A mixture of emotions, expected when&nbsp;people&nbsp;find out the truth.  &nbsp;  I actually feel as though I have cheated on Angela, not Sandra! I am devastated at the thought that I might lose her. The mixture of emotion is strange, new and scary. How can these feelings be so strong for someone? If only we knew.  &nbsp;  One thing is for sure, I've let her&nbsp;and myself down and Angela is going to be the one left to pick up the pieces.  &nbsp;  I hope we are&nbsp;strong enough to get through this.

      Well by now Angela will be part way through June. I've done it, exposed my soul, my life, my thoughts, my actions. I feel totally exposed....very vulnerable! &nbsp; I hope I've done the right thing. I've done it out of trust. I have total trust, total faith....total lots of things, for a person I 've known little more than a week.&nbsp;It&nbsp;not about&nbsp;lust, nor&nbsp;sex, nor a&nbsp;craving of affection. Its more than that....its special. &nbsp; ....and now I've got to try and get to sleep - lmfao!

      I am really agonising over whether to let Angela know about my Blog. I've been thinking it for a while, but I am scared she won't like what she reads and it might just be a case of it being too much for her to cope with. &nbsp; Its tearing me up inside that I have a secret from her - probably my only one - but it contains lots of other little secrets. What to do? - I have come so close to telling her on more than one occasion, but I don't want to lose her.  &nbsp; We had our 1 week anniversary today. Only a week, but it feels like she knows more about me than 13 years with Sandra. Angela - Angel....mine anyway. God sent? Who knows? .....probably!

      The lady from Personnel got in on the act today. Insistence from my boss that my screen is the cause of headaches at work, meant he referred it to Health &amp; Saftey for an assessment. When she arrived I told her I was an assessor myself, so she asked what the real problem was.  &nbsp; She cited a poor working environment and possible conflicts amongst staff, so I gave her the whole history of my move over here 2 years ago, how it was really poor for 12 months, but is generally OK now, although the idiot who thinks he is boss cannot man manage a paper bag. She said I was showing signs of depression (she used to be a nurse) so I told her about the doctor and the counsellor, although I didn't mention the home issues. She said I should keep a diary - LOL and that I looked shattered and should have the rest of the day off - PMSL

      I had no&nbsp;sleep at all last night (Rob came into our bed at midnight and stayed there) he's such a damned fidget. I could hardly get out of bed this morning and slept right through the alarm for an hour. When I did get up, I had to iron my trousers and shirt and find my footie kit for tonight, so I thought I would be very late. Sandra actually gave me a hug this morning. She put&nbsp;one arm round me and sort of snuggled me. Our kiss "bye" was still just a peck though.

      So far tonight has been quiet. The meeting at school finished at 20:30 and I've been moping round like a lost sheep for the last hour. Sandra has gone to bed and if it weren't quite so early, I would go too. I don't want to be waking in the night and I don't want to be tempted to have sex. I don't enjoy it with Sandra, it is just a comfort - does that make sense? &nbsp; Oh, its my Mom's birthday today - another reason to go to bed early - LOL, but that is a different story (we dont get on)!

      Thank you God for Mia, she is going through shit and is still there for me. We have been chatting on MSN all day, with friendly chat, flirtation, vulgarity, blantant sexual comments and care. I have a thumping head (half from all the typing and half from the annoying call with the counsellor), yet still she is there, offering advice and suggestions.

      Just phoned up for another appointment to be told there weren't any until the 2nd August (this woman is seriously pissing me off, I have no faith in her). She is going to put me on the list for cancellation cover. I have given my mobile, just in case. The passing comment....."Shame you didn't ring earlier, you could have come in this afternoon" ...........aaaarrrrgggghhhhh!

      I managed to get back in time for tea. The scratches on my arms were covered with the story of lending a mate some steps and getting roped into cutting down&nbsp;HIS conifers.&nbsp;We had an&nbsp;arrangement to pick up the kids from their Nans, where we would all meet up and have dinner, before coming home. A nice roast beef and yorkshire puds put pay to my fitness and healthy eating day.  &nbsp;  Sandra had an early start in the morning with work, so the kids stopped over again. When we got home, Sandra went for a bath, while I sorted out my work stuff. When she came down, she asked if I wanted to go and see Shrek 2. I asked if it was a date and she shrugged her shoulders.  &nbsp;  While she got ready, I decided on Harry Potter 3, as none of the kids would want to see it. It was a good film (predicatbly too scary for the kids) and the popcorn and coke went down well. We didn't talk a lot and held hands just once, when she felt scared of some yobs as we were leaving.

      With Sandra being at work and having no kids because they stopped at their Nan's last night (because we went out) I had an afternoon to myself. Following on from the cleaning, washing-up, polishing and a spot of gardening,&nbsp;I decided to give Angela a ring.  &nbsp;  Her kids were back home after their holiday, but she didn't mind, although I would have to bring my steps over to help chop down the hedge. Well this bloody hedge comprised of at least 16, 20 ft high conifers. And my steps were 6 ft. So that settled it, the new hedge was going to be 10 ft by the time I finished. Nearly 3 hours later, I was only half way though. As the electric trimmer was only capable of shaping the edges, I had to manually saw through the rest.  &nbsp;  It still needs finishing off, but Angela decided I needed to be finished off before I left too, so she dragged me upstairs and locked me in the bedroom&nbsp; - thank God for Stuart Little - LOL

      The gym really surprised me. I thought I would find it boring, but on the electronic machines, I found it a therapeutic way to relax and work up a sweat while burning calories. I wasn't that keen on the resistance machines (weights) but I did them nonetheless.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     Spent over an hour and a half there having really enjoyed myself and even arranged to go again during the week. Its not at the gym I would go to regularly, but it was OK.

      Well after getting the girls out to their Saturday club and having dodged the rain showers at work, I got home to a grateful rest. Well thats what I thought.  &nbsp;  Sandra had arranged for us to go out and play happy couples at our friends house round the corner.   While Sandra had a shower, I lay on the bed trying to grab some&nbsp;rest. The temptation while she was getting ready was too much and I asked if we could have sex. Her reply of "if you have to" was met by her taking her towel&nbsp;off,&nbsp;lying on the bed, closing her eyes, parting her legs and saying "hurry up"....I did!  &nbsp;  Armed with a bottle of red, we made our way over for tea (at 20:30) I was starving, having already rung to see if I could have a pack of chips at 17:30 to tide me over - our host suggested a banana.  &nbsp;  We arrived and sat at opposite ends of a 4 seat sofa, which I found amusing&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  The meal was nice, a mousaka, although it wasn't that filling, with just a salad to go with it. By the time we had finished coffee, I was shattered and we got home before midnight, with Paul and I having arranged to go to the gym in the morning.

      Tonight it was the turn of Rob to have an awards ceremony. He has only just started at his group so he just got a welcome present. The band was really good, they have won loads of competitions this year, so it was nice to see them perform for us. It seems Louise may be able to join, but she needs to go on Monday night to see what instrument she could play - almost thought of joining her - lol.

      Having slept quite well, it was up early for work. I got an odd comment from Sandra about being late back, but with the people I was supposed to be with, it was covered well. I am hoping to be able to make Thursdays a regular event, with cover from me going out with friends.  &nbsp;  I had time off this afternoon to enable me to go to the counsellor appointment. Got there, having had to book 2 hours off work, only to be told she had gone off sick. I am still really pissed off about it.   Apparently they treid to get hold of me, but I have to ring back on Monday to re-schedule.

      Last night went well. Managed to get over for 20:00. Spent the night drinking coffee, while Angela downed a bottle of red wine as we both felt too tired to go out. We chatted, things got very deep (conversationally) and we made love into the late hours and cuddled. I got home late, but it was worth the time spent being happy, just to enable me to re-group.

      The plan is to get over to Leicester again tonight, perhaps a bit of bowling or a drink. I've already sowed the seed for being out with Sandra and she seems OK with the excuse I gave her. Oh well, fingers crossed the kids go to bed good and don't play up!

      Bloody up at 02:30 again, eventually got out of bed and made a hot milky drink at 03:00. I had hoped it would settle me down, but it seemed to wake me up all the more. I watched TV for half an hour, then hit the PC and mailed Angela. I got a reply almost instantly as she was on night shifts at work, so that was it; stage set for 2 hours of chatting online via email - I dont think she got much work done.  Eventually went to bed at 05:30, dropped off at about 6 then was woken 30 mins later by the alarm.....lovely!  I got into work really late. Simon collared me and said he thought he had dropped me in it. Apparently when his Mom rang him later that day he asked how I was as I had gone off sick. She of course had said she had been there all afternoon and hadn't seen me.   Talk about quick thinking, I used the phone excuse and not wanting to go home with MIL and kids there. Bluffed my way through saying I went to the park. It seemed to work, but I was so involved that an hour later I even told Mia the same story. While I was telling her I kept thinking "she will only read the truth later, why are you feeding her this crap" but I was too far gone to back track and it would give me practise in sounding convincing if I was quizzed by Sandra later.  Sorry Mia

      Got back from Leicester at 18:45, an hour later than when I usually get home. There was no-one home. Managed to get in a quick cup of coffee before going out to a school meeting at 19:00. Inevitably, that over-ran, home again for 21:30 then off to bed an hour later, after some tea.  Sandra asked where I had been and I said I had expected to have to work over due to being late back from the bank (she didn't know I'd booked the afternoon off sick). We went to bed, in silence and both tired.

      Got a text off Angela this afternoon, wishing she could have a hug. Well I don't need asking twice so I headed over to Leicester, seeing as MIL had put a spanner in the works (with regards to my original plan). We had a couple of hours together, went to get some car parts for one of her friends and shared a coffee while cuddling up on the sofa. We talked and laughed and kissed loads. I told her I was really happy just being there with her and wasn't at all bothered about not having sex with her, as with other people I had met, because she meant more to me than that. The next thing you know she took my hand and lead me upstairs.  The strange thing was I actually tried to stop her. I asked if she was sure (more than once) and said I didn't want her to feel used and I didn't want to spoil anything. Nothing I said would prevent her though, she "had an itch that needed scratching" as she put it.  Well I won't go into details other than to say we "made love" and I use that term rather than "had sex" because it is exactly what it was, - two people forming a bond, coming together, (excuse the pun) being as one.  It made me late home though

      OK, so I started off well. Met Sandra at the bank and went for a coffee before heading off home. Halfway home my mobile rang and by the time I pull over its gone to the voicemail. I get the message "Relate have rung home and left a message with Mom, bit embarrassing but can you call them back."  Well I don't mind her taking the message but I'm not going home if she is there cos the kids will be there too and I won't get any sleep - what should I do?

      I've had enough now - time to go and get some kip! They have been drilling and banging in the room next door and its killing me on top of being tired. I've got to out to the bank to meet Sandra, but I don't fancy coming back, so will take the rest of the day off sick and try and get some sleep.

      Relate phoned again this morning. I spoke with the manager and explained my position, she was very understanding and said I could pay as much as I could afford now and discuss the rest with the counselor. I opted for 15 UKP, which she said was fine. Sandra had said she didn't want to come, but the lady said if she could come to the first one to be assessed that would be better, even if she didn't want to come to any more.   She is due to call back to arrange the appointment.

      Took an extra hour for lunch and went into the City Centre to meet Angela of all people. She had come over with a friend who had some work to do. Totally spontaneous, not pre-arranged or anything, she just emailed and said she was coming over to do shome shopping. I've not even shaved, brushed my teeth and I'm wearing trampy clothes today....bloody typical!  We had agreed on just meeting as friends for coffee - nothing more, but during the last couple of days we had had a couple of heart to hearts and she had come to realise that I was indeed telling the truth and not just after her as another woman on the side, or sexual conquest.  After walking to the shopping centre on the other side of town, I went to put my arm round her as a form of support when she was telling me something - just to say I was there if she needed it. She immediately came forward and kissed me - for ages - in the middle of the street, with loads of people around. The most unromantic place, the most unromantic time, but it just felt so right, so natural, so .....nice! We never made the coffee place, we stood overlooking the church, talking, hugging, kissing, listening and caring about each other. It felt soooo nice to be wanted and to feel appreciated. Not sex, not perverted, just simple feelings of happiness.  WOW!

      I have a department here that has been giving me grief today.     I used to work with them and there are very complicated public sector political links that are too deep to go into here, but basically I have been playing piggy in the middle all day.  They put a call in, I am told by my director to close it and refer them to the supplier, they contact supplier, supplier says they need to speak to someone in IT. Director says close it - supplier can send someone in to cover it under their agreements and the circle continues, with me just being the political pawn.  Interestingly my director said "well you can handle it, your robust." To which I replied with a one liner about being delicate. After we had finished the work discussion he went digging for more info on my one liner, so I admitted to him, very bashfully, that I had been diagnosed with depression and that I was on meds, not sleeping and up for counseling and further referral. I also mentioned my lack of concentration and having to take things one day at a time. He asked what the cause was, and I said I wasn't sure at the moment, but put the trigger down to the difficulties I was experienced at work when I moved department.

      "I am not strong enough to do anything about it and I dont think you are either, so it looks like we are going to be unhappy for the rest of our lives." Said Sandra. She continued "Yes I have been like it since we got married. I begged to have you back (we split on the run up to our wedding), I got pregnant (during the making up process) and I agreed to things I didn't want just to keep you. I have done ever since....we have never been a happy house".  She is not strong enough for Relate or to see the doctor as she doesn't want to humiliate herself again. "It's too soon, why can't we just sort out the money side first?" She said. "I don't want the pain agiain, it's not something I am brave enough to do like you."

      Just managed to get through to Relate. She took my details, then said there was a 45 UKP charge for each session! I told her I couldn't afford that and her manager is going to ring me back to discuss options for reduced payments. Lets hope they can get it down to 10-15 quid or something. I have said she can leave a message if she needs to.

      Just dropped a couple of links in to other blogs of note. "Not a Lot" comes from my good friend Mia, while "Demons in Me" comes from Ecks, in Australia. I like his blogs cos while he is in a totally different situation, in another part of the world, there seems to be a lot of similarities.

      Simon just popped in and asked how I was. Then asked how things were at home. I told him I thought Sandra was jealous of the fact that I had been out enjoying myself while she was at home with the kids.  His comment was "so she's had them for a day for a change, rather than dumping them at my mums, you mean". From my point of view it seemed a strange thing to say and I took it as though he was sort of telling me he supported me. Almost as though it was his way of telling me she should buck her ideas up.  I can't quite work it out though, so I don't know if I am on the right wavelength.

      Tried them 3 times over the weekend and all I get is an answer machine. Checked the opening hours, they seem OK, but the email address bounces back with an NDR. I've notified Relate HQ but so far no answer, despite the fact they have read my email to them.

      Well it was carry on as we left off after I got back from Silverstone. Sandra was in  a strop. I tried to give her a hug but she didn't want to know. She moaned about having been left with the kids all day while I was off enjoying myself. I said that perhaps I should move out - her comment was we can't afford it. So I suggested seperate beds but she said there wasn't enough room. She still says (although not convincingly) that she wants to be with me.  She continues that any affection is hypocritical as the other day I was contemplating killing her, but now I wanted sex. I had told her how I was feeling to try to shock her into realising how bad I had felt. It doesn't seem to have made any change.

      Sandra spent the evening writing cheques and closure letters for several of the main creditors, so hopefully they will be piad off soon. I need to hadd 500 UKP from the savings to allow us to pay off thelast of my cards. Its a bit of a blow, but I'd rather have it out of the way.

      Fantastic day today. Got up (before the alarm again) and was waiting outside for my lift - good start! During one of the warm up races there was a major accident right in front of us, and the GP itself was good too, although the winner was a bit predictable! The traffic wan't too bad on the way home - only took 90 mis to get to the M40, which by previous years was a total bonus apparently.  Highlight of my day - a 50 minute phone conversation with Angela. She sounds older than she looks (although at 37 she is 4 years older than me) and while she knows how to have fun she is sensible too. We shared some serious moments about married life but had a great laugh too. I even managed to get her to agree to coffee one day ;)

      The alarm went off at 05:30 - I had already been awake for over 30 mins. I got ready to go after Sandra had threatened me "don't you dare waste my brothers money, by not going". Sandra had said that "they ware going between 06:00 and 06:15" and that I "should take my rucksack to help carry the food and drinks."  I drove over to my FIL's house - no car, but it was only 06:10 - where were they? 5 mins later I had a call on my mobile.   "Where are you?"  "I'm at your house." "What you doing there I said I would pick you up at 06:15 from yours." "Sorry, thats not the message I got, there was no suggestion you would be picking me up." "Stay there, I'll come and get you."  Great, here I was in the wrong place...fantastic! The traffic would be shit, everyone would be late and miss the practise session, possibly qualifying as well and I would get the blame for not following instructions. Why couldn't Sandra have told me or been clearer? I looked up at the window of the house, my MIL was there and she mouthed "you pratt....you pratt" at me. My heart sunk even further, I couldn't take much more of this. It was all I could do not to cry.  The journey there was in virtual silence, Simon tried to dispell any atmosphere by saying it was history and to forget it, but I still felt burdened. Fortunately, though the traffic was light, we arrived in plenty of time having gone a different way - I was washed by a wave of relief and the day picked up as the racing began.

      Nasty comments from Sandra tonight. Basically she feels as though I am making a fuss so that everyone treats me nicely. She cited Simon and the GP tickets and the fact that we have been looking at Health Clubs just "so that Jon can feel better, bugger everyone else".   There were a few other comments - basically silly ones - but with the way I am feeling they just get to me, when at any other time they would be water off a ducks back. I went to get up to go out for a cycle to get rid of my feelings but Sandra prevented me from going, with more cutting comments.  We sat on the sofa in silence, for over half an hour my thoughts ranged from which knife do I use and how do I kill her, to how do I hurt myself, what would be the best way? It was very scary. I can remember thinking at the time, this is dangerous and being really worried about it, but it didn't stop me.   The room physically shook from side to side as I looked at it. If I closed my eyes, my body felt as though it was physically spinning - over and over. The only way I could stop it was to get up and go, when Sandra left the room. I drove round for a bit, pulled up at the park down the road and went for a run, as hard as I could, in the pitch black of the park.  By the time I got home and hour later, Sandra was in bed, apparently asleep. I did feel better, but I was scared, tired and low. That is the first time I can recall wanting to kill Sandra or even self harm myself.

      I completed the wireless network after finishing work today. It took a couple of hours, slightly longer than planned, as I had to remove a virus off the laptop the customer was using. The money paid for the parts and the extra (profit) went to the next door neighbour for the work he had done to his car, after I had put a dent in his wing last year. Easy come, easy go, but al least it was another debt busted!  Sandra says that money will be tighter than she had originally thought as we still have to pay off the overdrafts and her credit card. Lets hope the mortgage rate doesn't go up any more.

      My Brother in Law (Simon) offered me a ticket to the British Grand Prix this weekend. As I am not doing any work I thought it would be good to go with him, my FIL and my SIL. I told Sandra and she said it would be OK. Simon has a contact at Jordan so as he had not mentioned any money (he usually does), I asssumed it was free. It turns out later that he has paid 75 quid for the ticket. I challenged him about this as I don't want to be treated like a charity case, but he just dismissed it as being his treat.

      Last night was great. I decided to stop up late to cool down from my run and to wait until I was tired enough to go to bed. I ended up chatting to Angela on MSN. Angela is a person who I met on the dating site. We have chatted, she knows all about me, but won't meet cos of my position. However as we have chatted, we have discovered that we get on really well. We have loads in common, like similar things and chat for ages, when it only seems like 5 mins. She knows that as we have chatted my fondness for her has grown. I told her last night that I wouldn't want to jump into bed with her just for sex because she was becoming more special (I meant it as well). We also discussed her holiday and I was able to give her some pointers as she was looking at South Devon. She basically booked it there and then over the net, having looked as some websites I sent her. It was fantastic, we have never met, I've never spoken to her or heard her voice, but we seem to have some sort of bond.  I had teased her previously by giving her my mobile number, but she scrubbed it. However things came full circle as we said good night at 01:00 and she offered to give me her details. I texted this morning to see how she was - the reply was "knackered"!

      I wanted to go for a cycle tonight, but after having got the kids to bed and got myself ready, Sandra made stupid comments. They were along the lines of "I'll have to get into this depression lark so that I can pop out for an hour to relax". That made me feel worse. I didn't go in the end because of it, and although she apologised, the damage had already been done.  I tried to make up for my lack of exercise by taking the dogs at 22:00 and having a run round the park. I got all sweaty for 5 minutes, but my legs and shins suffered on the uneven ground.

      The kids had their school report last night, in general we were very pleased with them. The only problem is that Rob is moving into a class, with a teacher that we are not that keen on. At this stage, they keep the same teacher for 2 years, so Sandra had some concerns. We both went in this morning to discuss it with the Head. She was surprised, but tried to allay our fears about the teacher concerned. We can't pinpoint the issue, just a gut feeling, that she is watching her time go by, until she retires. The appointment made me a bit late for work, but who cares, sometimes the kids come first.

      It seems as though we might be short on the amount to clear our debts. The 2nd charge on the house has a higher settlement figure than we thought, by 4,000 UKP. The result is we don't have enough to clear our overdrafts and Sandra's Visa. I've asked her if it can all go to clearing my cards as a priority, so that  I am not tempted to spend on them. She seems happy with this, although the dicovery caused some tension.  Just before bed, I decided to take the dogs a walk and while I was out, I did a few laps of the field. I surprised myself by the distance I did, before getting out of breath. By the time I got back, Sandra had gone to bed, so I spent 30 mins on the computer, chatting, while I was cooling down.

      Insomnia - the first song on the radio on the way in to work. "I can't get no sleep"....How apt!  02:30 was the best I managed, before Rob came into our bed feeling unwell. He has been for a couple of days, but last night was a bad night for him....and me! I just couldn't get out of bed today - 06:30 the alarm goes off, it turns off at 07:30 and I was still in bed at 07:45. Just about got into work for 09:00!  I feel a bit stiff after the football last night - it was a good work out, I broke into a sweat (for the first time ever) but felt afterwards, that I could have done more. I also got a nice friction burn on my knee, from the astro turf pitch.   I went straight from there to a parents evening with the violin teacher. Some good comments about the work being put in by Louise to her ability to read music, rather than just remembering the tune. By the time we got home, there was just enough time for tea, before going to bed at 22:00.

      I am struggling today to stay focussed. I don't know whether it's because of lack of sleep or if it's due to boredom through not being motivated to do any work. I've done nothing but eat again and spent most of the day chatting on the net. I've had 2 blatant offers of sex, one for Saturday and one for Monday - all arranged with date, time, place.   I've just gone off at a friend for no reason. I was being crude, thinking at the time it was funny, then as I read it, I realised I was abusing the trust and friendship that had been built up. To her credit, she is being an absolute rock, if it were me I would have thrown it back 10 fold.  I am hoping I can get motivated sufficiently for football later. I want to work so damned hard that I collapse, just to try and get this shit out of my system. I just hope my body will allow me to do it. Perhaps I should look at the gym sooner, rather than later, or perhaps I need to find something else, or just get some sleep.

      I spent pretty much the whole of yesterday eating. Crisps, biscuits, snacks, fruit, dinners, puddings, chips....the list goes on and today I feel fat, but I'm still hungry.  Last night Sandra and I spent some time trying to find a cottage to holiday in during October. Sandra feels guilty that she is spending money, but I pointed out that we will need to spend some money on ourselves, we need a break and it will be the first time it will be paid for before we go.  Last night was pants. No sleep at all from 04:00 - again! Didn't get up, although I was very tempted this time. The trouble is, I could fall asleep standing up now, I'm shattered!

      Set off early today and got in for 07:45. The traffic wasn't too bad at that time, but a lot of people struggled in late due to the major roadworks on the M6. The office is quite subdued at the moment, with 2 out of the 4 being in a foul mood. Sandra has had the day off today with suspected chicken pox!!!  Oh the joys! We had sex last night too. Nothing to shout home about, just trying to keep a record. She cryed afterwards and I felt empty, devoid of feeling - it wasn't nice. I will try and get hold of Relate today or tomorrow.

      Well a call from the "Mother In Law" suggests we have 3 kids with chicken pox - they all stopped over last night as we went out to the BBQ. A mad rush over there confirmed our 'fears'. They all wanted to stop put for the day, which suited me.  Sandra and I decided to have lunch out - we went to the local supermarket cafe and lunched for 4 quid. Next stop was the bowling alley to drop off a present to a birthday party that Rob was supposed to be going too, but now couldn't.  Following that we decided to look round the local health clubs, very nice but a tad expensive at 45 UKP per month (6 months min) or 30 UKP month at the local public gym (but with 12 month min). Sandra decided a  review of finances was required first - fair enough - neither of the clubs offered a one month trial without committment.  We got back home late in the afternoon - via the garden centre for 12 quids worth of plants - and planted out the front garden. It was quite nice considering the budget! A quick tea and while Sandra went to pick up the kids, I decided to cycle to church for the evening service (not the usual service we do). It was a stand-in to the usual minister, and he was very good, splitting the sermon into 4 parts of 5 mins each.

      We went over to a friend of Sandra's tonight for a BBQ. They used to work together. The evening was very strained, I didn't know anyone, and Sandra only knew one other person. I had 1 bottle of beer, with my burger then moved to soft drinks as I was driving. We came away at 23:00, it was pleasant enough but not exactly relaxing if you know what I mean.

      This morning is mad. Sandra is working, so am I from lunch time. We have kids who were up all night chatting and laughing and now can't get up out of bed for dancing. Sandra is panicing about getting them and herself ready and everyone is copping out.  I have to get ready to take the girls and friends dancing at 10.00. I have to take Rob to his Nan's to be looked after, then get back in time to get ready for work. It looks like it could rain as well, which is going to make this afternoon fun!

      Tonight was interesting. On my way home I had popped in to assess a network install and do some email faults for a customer. With the money from that and the job on Thursday, I bought a drinks bottle and pump for the bike and a rear "eye level" brake light for the car.  I was in the process of fitting the parts to my bike, when Sandra phoned. Our friend over the way had called her as their daughter had come off her bike - could I go round? Despite being a nurse, Sandra hates first aid, so I obliged and the girl went off for X-Rays to her elbow.  We kept hold of the younger daughter, while the rest of the family went to hospital. By the time they got back, we had next doors lad in with a fractured collarbone. He had done it previously, but wanted his sling re-done. There were kids and parents everywhere.  We ended up having the youngest daughter over on a stop over, when they asked at the most awkward time. We felt as though we were in a position and couldn't say "no"......KIDS!

      Well I don't know what to think about my first "session". The counselor was young and didn't really seem to be asking the right questions. "Do I wash my hands a lot, or do I have to have things in order, or do things have to be in a straight line?"  I knew exactly what she was trying to get at, but her questions came out of a leaflet and did not relate to me personally. I found it very difficult to talk to her (not like with the doctor at all) and came away feeling disappointed.   She originally decided to give me a leaflet to take home on obsessive, compulsive behaviour, but then changed her mind at the last minute to one about Depression. She also suggested I contact Relate.   The one thing she did do, was to suggest a referral to the Mental Health Unit for a full assessment. I said yes to this, but mainly because I got the impression that she didn't know what she was doing.

      Just had news from Sandra about Rob. He had his health check today and failed his eye sight test. He couldn't read out of his right eye. In his words "he couldn't see it". So it looks like we've got a trip to the opticians with him this weekend!  When will we ever get a break ?

      I got home just before 21:00 and was very wound up. I couldn't settle or relax at all, but didn't want to go out running or cycling. In the end I had a bacon sandwich and watched some TV. By about 22:30 I was feeling shattered and eventually we went to bed at about 23:00.  I read for a bit and tried to get some sleep. Unfortunately, our youngest daughter came in after having had a nightmare at about 01:30. She stayed with us all night, which meant I felt uncomfortable and couldn't sleep at all. By about 4 or 5 I was considering going into her bed, but last time I did that I couldn't settle either, so I gave it a miss.  Today I am exhausted, but I am trying to keep myself busy so that I don't sit and think about this appointment later. Just typing about it, I can feel myself becoming uneasy.

      We have a new person joining our team today. He is young and overly keen and of course has a lot to learn. A lot of the attention is focussed on him today, which should be a good thing. The problem is, his desk is next to mine, so it's like "New Street Station" here at the moment. I am finding it very unsettling.  I dont know why, but I seem to view everything as a problem, or look at the negative in daily situations or things I do. Today I feel down or as if the slightest thing is getting on top of me. I feel as though I am creating problems out of nothing.  I have just completed a training session (which I enjoyed) but I spent the latter part of it thinking about fishing. Buying a new rod and tackle and spending hours by a river bank. Is this a serious healthy interest or is it a fad to enable me to spend money so that I feel better in myself? Does anyone know? Oh I wish I could curl up and go to sleep.  I have to work on a "foreigner" when I finish today to network someone at home. It could take a while, but I can think of a hundred things I would rather be doing.

      Well one out of 2 anyway!   Sandra's reply was "if you need too" when I asked if I could be inside her. I think she agreed on the basis of getting more sleep if I left her alone. As far as my sleep went I woke twice during the night, then just before 06:00 I was restless because I couldn't get comfortable as my joints seemed to ache.  I finished my first box of tablets today, already I have 2 more to replace them (another 60 days), but they are by a different manufacturer. I have my first appointment with my counselor tomorrow afternoon. The thought of it is starting to make me a bit tetchy.

      Another argument with the phone company today and yesterday. They were supposed to have ordered a new SIM for me last week. It's still not arrived and I have now been told it wasn't ordered in the first place. They have now supposedly ordered another one, but I have to wait another 7-10 days.

      Another couple of emails from Angela, the first saying she thinks she has lost me, the second saying she knows she is being demanding, but lets meet, talk and put the fun back into our lifes. This has made me happier this morning I must admit, but it is all very up and down at the moment. I am still sure it will work out in the end.

      So now the new kid has been in 2 minutes, takes his coat off and says "Has anyone boiled the kettle?" My reply..."Yes about an hour ago."  Well that starts it doesn't it. "Do you book 08:00 on your time sheet, I didn't think you were allowed too?"  ....The debate continues (and if you haven't guessed its another sore point) what with all the roadworks, poor weather conditions and time I owe due to having to go to the doctors. If I set out early in case of a bad journey, is it my fault that I get in early due to lighter than expected traffic? Or would they prefer me to come in late, just in case, and owe them another 30 mins?  FOR FUCKS SAKE!........It is me isn't it... I'm just being stupid aren't I?

      Just read an email from Angela. She wrote it last night, but it is very painful to read. She still wants us to be just friends, but nothing more. I suppose it's down to all the baggage I have. To be honest who can really blame her? - a single free happy life with the only problems being your own or taking on me.... and a "married at the moment" me as well.  As if I haven't lumbered her with enough, without her being dragged through someone elses divorce too.  I can't blame her, I don't blame her and if I am truthful I can't expect her to be there "on my terms" - how fair is that in a relationship?

      I got very little sleep last night, after talking to Angela most of the night. It seems she wants to revert back to being "just friends". Its my own fault, she wanted me to spend the weekend with her so that we weren't clock watching. A reasonable request, but one that I can't make at the moment.  I want to move out, but with everything that is going on I know I don't have the mental strength to cope with the lonely times or the low points on my own. I don't trust myself. These last few months have seen me out of character....agressive, angry and tearful. It hit home with the letters last week and I don't think I've got over that.  Today is going to be a bad day, I can tell already. I'm not in the mood and my team leader has come in and the way he is, I can tell he's going to get to me. Our day sarts at 08:30, he walked in at 08:35 and the first thing he says......"you're in early!".........arrrgh! Whats the point?  IS IT JUST ME? AM I BEING UNREASONABLE?

      Why does life always seem to be a case of 2 steps forward and 1 step back. I was really looking forward to chatting to Angela after so long, but it seemed as though all the frustration came to the surface. Is it because we haven't seen each other for over a week or is it the situation or both?  It seems we both have really strong feelings for each other, yet those same feelings seem to be creating an obstacle between us. Are we both scared? I certainly didn't intend to feel this way about someone so quickly, but I dont't want it to spoil anything either.

      Think of a number between 2 and 4, then steer well clear of them. Their customer service is shit. I've spent 2 weeks on the phone to India, spending anything up to 90 minutes at a time on hold. They wont put me through to the relevant department (collections) without me explaining everything to 3 other people. I've been cut off 4 times while on hold - make that 5....   THEY DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING - ARRGH!  Call 6 today - "Will I be getting a new number?" "Yes!" "Last time I rang they said I could keep my old number. " "No actually you will get a new number." "I'm not happy having a new number." "My mistake you can keep your old number." "Sorry, but I dont believe you, can you put me through to collections in the UK please?" "No you can't speak to collections." "I am the customer, I want to pay a bill, put me through to collections please." Silence......"OK I will put you through, please hold.........."

      For those of you who may be wondering, yes thats right there has been a distinct lack of sex recently. No mention of it, means that I haven't had any thoughts or actions in that area.  Why?  Well it may seem like a strange concept to those looking in on the life of a married man, but Angela has been on holiday and any previous thoughts or needs I have had to just get my end away with the woman lying next to me have gone.  Don't ask me why, it all seems to be subconcious. I could say the reason I think it's happening like this, but the mention of the word or words would be unfair and sometimes is just plain scary. I also want to be really sure of myself.

      Things seem a little quieter at work this week. After running round like a tit, all last week it comes as a refreshing relief and has allowed me to catch up on important things like blogging!  I've still got my sick note and it seems to be helping me to cope (knowing I've got a saftey net I suppose). I've also just had an email from Angela and it looks as though she will be home early due to the bad weather, so that in itself is a help. I would love to get over and see her before the weekend, so fingers crossed.

      This weekend has flown by. I was working in Luton on Saturday, in scorching temperatures, it turned out to be a long slog, but it kept me busy and active. Sunday was spent down the gym and doing housework - lawns, washing, cleaning floors, washing up, ironing, dropping films off etc etc. Before I knew where I was it was 20:00 Hrs. The highlight of the day was a half hour phone conversation with Angela. It got a bit heavy, but I didn't mind - such are our feelings for each other. How can one person make you feel so different about yourself?

      That's me! It's official!  I was having a good day today - work was OK, I was feeling good. Even had some messages off Angela.....but then I got home to two letters.  The first one (off the counsellor) said she was really concerned about me telling her of the knife incident, she had discussed it with the doctor and was strongly advised to contact the mental health team for a more urgent referral. Well that made me feel really good didn't it!  The second one (off the mortgage company) said that they refuse to cover me on any life policy until the outcome of any medical investiagtions, and will only cover Sandra. Basically they have labelled me as too high a risk to insure - very very scary! So even if I wanted to kill myself now I can't and if I die by accident my kids suffer - great!

      I managed to speak to Anglea yesterday. We were both disappointed at not being able to meet up this week, but it was great to be able to hear her voice again. She sounds like she is having a great time with the friendly locals - hehe! It helped me get through the day at work too. Every time I felt as though I was slipping, I would just think of this sweet accent.  It was the MIL's birthday as well, so I popped in to say hello and to see the kids. They were really great - had loads of hugs and I even stayed for tea. Sandra left early to go to her fitness class, so I was able to eat my chinese in peace. By the time I had finished it was time to go down the gym and work up a sweat, although it didn't help me sleep any better!

      I had my latest appointment last Friday. It was another waste of time. We went through the basics and although she didn't ask the right questions again, I made a point of just telling her all about the last few weeks in one big swoop. Right at the end of my "little bit" I happened to mention that I had had a letter from the mental health team telling me I was on the waiting list. They expect to see me in 3 months time, although haven't issued a date yet.  It seemed to act as a cue for her to say "right well in that case its pointless starting anything with you, do you want to make another appointment with me or just wait until the referral comes through?"  I chose to wait - stupid fucking incompetent cow! That might be a bit harsh, but its the way I feel.

      She is away at the moment, camping in Devon....is that why we have rain and thunder storms? - LOL.  I really miss her, we have met once since our "split" and we got on really well. We went down to her local pub on a glorious evening and spent the night catching up over a pint! It was good to be able to see her and talk to her properly. We had been limiting ourselves to the odd chat on MSN and I had decided not to be pushy and give her the space she needed to make up her mind where she wanted to be, in terms of our relationship. I am glad I did, because things seem to have turned out OK. I can't wait to ring her and hear her voice, but at the moment my moble phone has been disconnected, but that's another story!  I had really hoped to be joining her on the camping trip for a couple of days, but with the combination of poor weather, the reluctance of the doctor to give me time off and that fact that the company I work for on Saturdays have left me an urgent message to contact them in the morning about my job at the weekend, it doesn't look as though I am going anywhere.

      So while I was off, I was beginning to get some sleep at night (well for 2 of them anyway) but I was definately getting more relaxed. Two days back at work and here I am at 02:30 again - wide awake. A pattern has been emerging since the weekend as the prospect of going back to work got closer.  Interestingly I didn't identify work as a problem area in my original lists. I thought I had got over a fairly significant "rough patch" from this avenue of my life. So why does it seem to be such a big issue again now? Is there a real problem there or am I creating one again due to the way I feel?

      Went to the Doc's again this morning, looking to get time off work. She was very reluctant to do anything though as in her words "it would be a slippery slope" and I wouldn't be getting back for some months (until after my mental health referral at least - 3 months down the line). She did offer me 2 weeks off on the basis that it would be non extendable, but she explained that she wants me to carry on at work unless I start to be a risk to myself or others.  My options now are 2 weeks off, then back to work in the short term (probably not feeling any better) or sit it out and wait until I chin someone at work or want to jump in front of a bus, in the knowledge that I would get long term time off.  Somehow the second option seems more appealing.....

      This is just a total nightmare. I've come back to a desk full of clutter, as it's been used as a dumping ground for the last week. My line manager is just being his normal rude arrogant self and he is unhappy with my attitude towards him. Things got worse this afternoon as my manager decided that rather than discussing things with me, he would go and tell the directors..... good management skills there eh?
