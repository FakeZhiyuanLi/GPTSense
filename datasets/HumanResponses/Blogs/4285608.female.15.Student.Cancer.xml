      Day in and day out  The same shit From her parents From her friends From herself. She can't take it any more.  She could talk to her friends about it... Oh, wait. She ain't got no friends. They abandoned her and left her for dead  And they were jackasses. Each and everyone of them. Not like she could talk to her parents,  They were drunken idiots who only cared 2 things,  How much they could drink and how much they hated the world. Well, that's one thing they had in common. All three of them hated the world. She couldn't take the pain and pressure anymore  So she decided to do it. One dark, moonless night, that knife started to look real friendly Should she? Shouldn't she? Would anyone care? These are the questions that rolled thru her demented mind. No one would care, what was she thinkin? She grabbed that knife, it was her only friend left now. She was trembling...the knife felt like ice in her hands. The radio was softly playing in the background when she did it.  She was slowly fading away now... and she was finally happy. The last thing she ever heard was the lyrics to a song... "Lean on me, when you're not strong, I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on..."  If only the lyrics spoke the truth, she would still be with us today.
