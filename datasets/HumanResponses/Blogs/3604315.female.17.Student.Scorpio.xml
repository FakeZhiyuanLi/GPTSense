      first post- what to say, what to say... school is so boring except for friends! my boyfriend eddie and i have been going out for a little over a year now, and all's great. we've gone to the next level and...decided to get a place together! yeay! my parents hated the idea though. they think it means their little seventeen-year-old baby will start to have sex, but it doesn't. it means we will be fucking every day now! they let me though (go figure).  my sister winnie thinks i'll decide not to go to college next year just to stay here with eddie, but i already decided not to go. i hate school, and besides, i have my secret job at a bar in town which pays big. just because she's at a cream-of-the-crop school doesn't mean i need to go too. everyone's not cut out for it.  my best friend laura thinks the move is great- i can have the time of my life during my senior year now, she says.  she wants to move in with us, i think, but nope. that'll ruin the private time (unless we get a threesome going...hum...not a half-bad idea).  time for me. i am 17, brunette, tan, and tall. i love my boyfriend, mexican food, magazines, weed, shopping, and sex. oh, and my name is mary, if you care.  more later

      laura's preg. i have no clue who the father is, since she's such a whore fucking someone new every night, but it could be eddie. why can't she just use fucking rubbers? they feel like shit, but being preg is shitty-er. she better get a abortion, or else her life's ruined. only love if you're prepared. bastard eddie, he better not be the father. if he is, i swear... he'll pay. for now, laura's at the health clinic.  eddie's being weird. he wants me to do strange shit during sex, like use some of those electric nipple shocker things. kind neat, but weird.  it's really strange how fun threesomes are. i like them better than being alone with eddie. kissing another girl is SO erotic. maybe i'm a lesbo. or bi. who knows. feeling those big boobs of laura's, her tongue with mine, feeling the throb of heat she has... OH MY GOSH, WHAT AM I SAYING???

      well, well, well. a lot has happened since my last post. a week-ish after, laura's bitc of a mom threw her out of the house and so she now lives with us. i also caugh her and eddie together, but then was delighted to hear that they had arranged a threesome for us (a surprise for me). hell yeah! if you've never had a threesome, go have one RIGHT NOW! all the boob to boob to dick stuff and all... heaven. my job's paying off, and my ass hurts from it. shitty school will be starting soon, but i've been thinking of dropping out. m job's paying good bucks, so who needs school? eddie also got a motorcycle, god horbid. that thing is SO loud and dangerous.  whatever, (un)virgin mary
