      	 T he wind and the waves are always at the side of the ablest navigators. Life is a journey with many routes to take. With so many people you’ll be able to meet, for sure decisions will be hard to make. My life has been through rolling waters, deafening thunders and storm-tossing conditions. But my ship is strong and enduring and with the wind blowing on my direction, I can carry through this journey. 	 A t age 10, I was already leading my own ship. From the fast paced cities of Manila, I found myself living a simple and carefree life in the province of Pangasinan. For less than a year, I had to live with my auntie, and study in the public schools of the town for at that time my family endured a great deal of financial shortcoming. I had to do it for my family, but I realized what it had done for me. Doors opened up for me leading me to a vast horizon of my unexplored talents awaiting to be discovered, and waiting to be showed off.  	 M usic runs in our blood. My brother and sister play the guitar so well and my aunts and uncles have the musical fingers to fondle the ivories of the piano.  When I spent a year at the town’s school, I was given the chance to be part of artistic students gifted with talent to harmoniously work on music. The star of the so-called “Pangkat Kawayan”, an ensemble of bamboo pipes and shakers, I played the bamboo xylophone-the marimba. After tedious practices and laborious recitals, I was able to perfect a repertoire of sweet melodious love songs and heritage aria of the Filipiniana. And soon, I found myself, applauded by many people delighted after a free concert. Aside from being a musician, I also became laureate of the Filipino rhetoric following a second victory in an interscholastic competition. And still with luck by my side, I became the no. 1 in our batch. 	 B efore my journey to the province, I never realized my abilities of being a good student. With my confidence at that time emanating, as soon as my family resiliently overcame the problems, I prepared myself to set sail back to the place where I truly belong. Where sailors are more viscous and where competitions begin. After the stay in the province, I became determined to keep up with their standards and before long I was striding side by side with the best of the best students. Proof to this were the meritorious certificates, medals and incentives from my hard work. From a no place student, to an ace student. 	 M y intellectual development was alongside the cultivation and the maturation of my individuality. And from my daily experiences, and reflections upon them, I have formulated several strategies to deal with the stresses of daily life. Moreover, in every instance, I am required to alter my being, my physical features and my total self to carry through. But more often, these self-alternation, turn to be mere impersonations and costume changes that eventually lead to entertainment. For in my life I have become a little drummer boy, a mouse on suspenders, a German army man, and even a sheik from the land of the deserts.  	 S ails on a ship control the west wind, so let it not be drifted away, for dark waters may come its way. Everyday, I continue my journey, battling the course of the tides. Pursuing my dreams, conquering islands and meeting the people in it. Still and all, moments will come that we get tired and give up when all our aching muscles pin us down. We leave it all to the wind and let our ship drift away. It’s a good thing that we do not sail away without our companions. When it’s too much for us to bear, they take control of our ships and lead us to wherever  we have dreamt of going to. They fulfill our dreams for us. My family sails and navigates me, and sets me free , without binds, without bounds.       L ife is like the ocean, you never know how deep it is. You cannot always dive to the heart of it, but at least we are given that single chance to sail on it and enjoy it .
