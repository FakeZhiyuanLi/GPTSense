       “Pray without ceasing” — Paul of Tarsus   Practiced guitar this morning until my thumbnail broke.  Black Hills Jack gave me a guided tour of Deadwood. I was a little disappointed that the original miner’s town is now a barren canyon. The town that is now Deadwood is kind of a Reno-wannabe. A row of small casinos in Victorian buildings, it just doesn’t do much spiritually.  Hiked to the Seth Bullock tombstone on Mt. Moriah. Great view of Mt. Roosevelt from there. Pretty steep hike—it felt good.  Drove up Spearfish Canyon and walked across the field where the final scene of Dances With Wolves was filmed. Lots of medicinal plants grow there—including euchanasia and choke cherry. Still a few bikes around from the Sturgis rally. Kind of glad the timing let me miss the crowds of Hot August Nights in Reno and the Sturgis Rally here. I just don’t get excited about machines.  Contemplative prayer comes easily these days. Seeing the Great Plains and the Black Hills for the first time brings a constant sense of wonder and appreciation. The beautiful people who have lived here for thousands of years, developing spiritual disciplines based on indigenous manifestations of the divine in nature. It always bugged me as a kid to read Bible stories about fig trees and olive trees—I couldn’t relate to them until I lived in California. To hear sacred stories about pine trees, eagles and bears helps me find the crossroads between the American Spirit and the Spirit of God   DAY TWENTY    I believe the United States of America has the potential to become a civilized nation. - Black Hills Jack   Said goodbye to Black Hills Jack this morning. I told him that I truly appreciated the generous hospitality and especially the great conversations. I told him I expected to be living in a tipi and instead he gives me his bedroom and he slept on the living room couch (where Kevin Costner slept). I told him that I was humbled by the huge interruption in his life for me. He smiled and teased me saying, “Well, I was raised Roman Catholic and of course we are taught to suffer.” I hope I see him again in this lifetime.  Stopped at the gas station in Pine Ridge, where it seemed just about everyone in town has lunch. Busy place in a very small town. Then off to Wounded Knee. I left tobacco offerings at the tombstone that sits upon a mass grave of ghost dancers who were slaughtered by the 7th cavalry to end the Sioux Wars as well as the site of a confrontation between the US government and the American Indian Movement in the 70’s. It is an eerie and disturbing place. A round building there commemorates the American Indian Movement.  Long drive back to Wayne, Nebraska. I found an FM radio station out of Mission, SD that played only Indian artists. They played an enjoyable little reggae song that I liked. Turns out the artist is a woman from Round Valley (Covelo) California. I may have to look her up next time I’m in Mendocino County.  Arrived at JC’s about 8 pm. Mary is on a spiritual retreat with several women with whom she went to seminary. They meet annually to support one another. We had dinner at the local steakhouse. JC is officiating a funeral tomorrow. Our dinner was discretely paid by a member of the deceased’s family.  I talked to Lewis’ wife Kathleen this afternoon. Lewis is attending a big meeting in St. Louis to develop a new type of alternative energy. I’m hoping he will have time to get started on the recording this week.

       In the early 1700’s the prophet Sweet Medicine lived several years in the Bear Butte. Upon his return, he delivered to the Cheyenne people the Way in which the people would live—including a legal system, code of ethics, rituals and ceremonies. He brought with him two medicine bundles—one a bundle of sacred arrows, the other a medicine hat bundle. —- Black Hills Jack   Wil and Ron told me that Bear Butte was an important place to visit on this Sabbatical. They both simply told me that the butte is a sacred place.  What they didn’t tell me is that Bear Butte is an American Mt. Sinai—many indigenous people make pilgrimages to Bear Butte. The cottonwood trees are filled with prayer cloths and tobacco ties, so it is a colorful hike up the hill. From the top of the butte, you can see five states. I want to climb the butte on my return trip to California. I felt a strong presence of the Holy there. On my birthday, 130 years ago, George A. Custer walked on Bear Butte as part of his Science Expedition. Strong winds today, so my offering of tobacco was quickly carried away. I noticed a sign that says human remains and ashes are not to be left on the butte.  My wife had a dream about the two of us in a precious place in the Badlands. I think I need to bring her here someday. I’m pretty sure this could be that precious place.  Jack and I also stopped at a US Cavalry cemetery—many children buried there. We also drove through Ft. Meade. Some of the most beautiful buildings are homes made of stone built by German POWs during WW II.  We visited Bill’s home. He has wonderful collections of all sorts hanging on his walls. One wall is completely covered with crosses and crucifixes of many cultures. Each piece has a story that Bill tells well. He took us to The Sugar Shack for “the best hamburgers in the hills”. The place really is a shack, and the burgers really are quite good.  Jack woke up at 4:30 this morning, so he had a long wait until I showered and appeared around 8 am. He immediately called Bill and said, “The bear has emerged from his cave!” Last night a dinner, a gay waiter asked Bill where Jack found “that griz of a bear!” They thought that they would have to explain the term to me, but I heard all about bears from the Bear and Those Who Admire Them convention held annually in Guerneville, CA. I have a feeling that I will be referred to as “the bear” for the rest of my stay in the Black Hills.  Bill worked for the BIA for years as a high school English teacher at Cheyenne River Indian Reservation in Eagle Butte. Both he and Jack have encyclopedic knowledge of the Lakota people, so it is easy to simply sit and listen to the stories and be fascinated.  Jack took a nap this afternoon so I spent some quality time with my guitar. I need to practice hard on Saturday to prepare for Sunday morning worship services. When Jack awoke, we took a drive to catch a peek at Mt. Rushmore and Crazy Horse Mountain. Enjoyed a light dinner in Custer, SD at the Purple Pie Shop—excellent place to dine.  Tomorrow will be my last day in the Black Hills. We plan to visit Deadwood—the entire town is a historical landmark. Jack continues to tell wonderful stories—especially entertaining is the story of the night Kevin Costner stayed here. Jack points to the couch and says, “He slept right here” then hold up a pair of white boxer shorts and says, “And he wore these while he did his laundry.” He really enjoyed his time creating wardrobes for the Dances With Wolves movie.  Jack’s walls are covered with Lakota artwork. Two mess bustles hand in the living room along with a hand drum, breastplates, chokers and paintings. My favorite is a Lakota-style last supper with Jesus and the Twelve wrapped inn colorful blankets, some with cloth headbands. They are all standing and looking very stoic with their faces surrounded by halos.

       Remember the Sabbath and keep it holy.  — Law of Moses  Yesterday was a day of rest and not driving. Took a long walk through Rapid City. Especially enjoyed browsing at the Prairie Edge store—a huge, beautiful building full of high end indigenous art. Gorgeous buffalo robes, dance clothes, paintings, beadwork, rare books… wonderful.  Rapid City has bronze statues of American presidents positioned at every street corner. I especially liked Ronald Reagan in cowboy garb and Jimmy Carter with his jacket over his shoulder smiling and waving.  Today I arrived at Black Hills Jack’s home. Jack is a man of great hospitality. He immediately made me feel right at home and we enjoyed several hours of good conversation before joining his friend Bill for dinner at a very nice Italian restaurant. Jack also welcomed me with a gift of a jeweled cross to wear with my robe. We plan to visit Bear Butte tomorrow and to take a gander at the Crazy Horse monument. Wil and Ron, friends of mine from Cleveland encouraged me to visit Black Hills Jack and also to visit Bear Butte. Many people consider the Butte a sacred place.  My favorite guitar player, Wayne Perkins is having health problems and cannot travel by plane. Lewis and I were hoping we could fly him up to Moline to do a session for the new project. Wayne is, however, planning to visit his son in Indiana, so a car trip may be possible soon. Because of this, I may have to begin work in Moline next week and then travel back for Rosebud Fair the following weekend. If that is what it takes to get Wayne’s contribution on the recording, then it will be worth it.  Black Hills Jack owns a Crystal Cave a little ways from here. I’ll probably walk over and take a look at it tomorrow morning.  Jack told me several great stories I had never heard before about good friends of mine. We were both amazed at how many people we both know from Ohio and Pennsylvania. On our drive back from dinner, we listened to a tape of White Eagle, a young Lakota man from Mission, SD who was a classically trained tenor. Fantastic recording.  Big dinner, good music, lots of stories to remember… I’m pretty tired. Been a good day.

       The evolution of the world is a great manifestation of God.  As scientists understand more and more about the interdependence not only of living things but of rocks, rivers - the whole of the universe - I am left in awe that I, too, am a part of this tremendous miracle.  Not only am I a part of this pulsating network, but I am and indispensable part.  It is not only theology that teaches me this, but it is the truth that environmentalists shout from the rooftops.  Every living creature is an essential part of the whole . —- Desmond Tutu - Anglican Archbishop of Capetown   Thanks for the quote Dr. Kobs!  Today was a day of goodbyes. I realized this morning that I spent a good chunk of this weekend in the company of really fine men and women. Frank, Calvin, Andrew, John, Lisa, David from New Mexico and David from Italy, Alan, Mike, Dan and Thom have been a joy. Everyone moved pretty slowly this morning. Big feast last night followed by giveaways and round dancing late into the night.  John Culpepper and I were chatting a couple days ago and I asked him if Peet’s coffee (my personal favorite roast) had any cafes in Los Angeles. He laughed and said, “Let me go brew you a cup”. He brought a pound of Peets to the Sundance! And he brewed another pot this morning and I was quite fired up to drive to Mission, SD to attend worship services and the United Methodist Church in Mission. John and Lisa, the bringers of Peets are not far from the Realm of God.  Uncle Frank and stood near two tipis—one canvas white, the other shades of dark gray. I read that Heyoka warriors reside in dark tipis. So I asked Frank, “Is that tipi for Heyokas?” He said, “No. I think that tipi was bought from the Dances With Wolves movie set. The set designers dyed the canvas to get the right ambience.” Frank is a man who knows many things. On the Rosebud Reservation, Sunday morning worship is still “the most segregated hour in America” (MLK) Lakota people attend Roman Catholic and Episcopal churches while Anglos attend Methodist and Evangelical. Sad news is that the St. Francis Catholic Church is being sued for sexual misconduct by a priest. My grandmother gave annually to the St. Francis Indian School. I joined about a dozen Methodists in the pews to hear Pastor Jackie Moon preach. Very kind and welcoming people at The United Methodist Church in Mission. Cool name for a church. David from Italy rode with me from Mission to Rapid City. I arrived at Butch and Billie’s house as David just finished videotaping an interview with Butch Artichoker. We all sat around the Artichoker dining room table searching for something worthy of saying when you know you won’t see each other for a long time. And so we broke a lengthy silence with laughter. Truly delightful and generous people they are.  Two stops on the drive to Rapid City. First stop was 1800 town home of the horse Cisco that Kevin Costner rode in Dances With Wolves. They have a large collection of Dances With Wolves items on display. The tipi was the same color as the one at the Sundance. Next stop was Wall Drug. Nice place to take a walk. You can buy a lot of stuff there. David from Italy and I ate dinner at a Cajun place recommended by Butch and Billie. Awesome food. As soon as David’s bus departed, I went to my room to take a hot shower, write this blog entry and begin some serious sleep time.

      God is One!  Yes, God is One but it is very complicated. We will watch over you as you integrate your knowledge. —- 8/14/04 I listen to spirits.  Most of my birthdays have been spent entirely outdoors. I opened my eyes this morning to the sound of Calvin Jumping Bull over the loud speakers and I arose when I heard the drum. Enjoyed Peet’s Coffee with the Culpepper Clan. Ate a couple of hot dogs at the Cookhouse Continental Breakfast then remembered I was supposed to sweat at 11 am. You don’t want to eat just prior to a sweat.  I danced hard throughout the second Sundance session of the day so that I might digest those hotdogs before the decorated the hot rocks. David from Italy decided that he would leave the Sundance and stay at the Artichoker house. He wanted to spend the afternoon videotaping an interview with Butch Artichoker. David said his goodbyes (ciao) to the camp and we drove past the prairie dogs and sunflowers from the Orin Horse Looking, Sr. Memorial Campgrounds.  Butch was waiting for us in the Sweat Lodge. We were joined by Dana and Alice. Dana is enrolled with the Cheyenne Nation in Montana. He was going to attend the Sundance in Montana this week, but “there were some political problems” and his tunkansila (grandfather) told him to wait until next year. The Lakota are the only nation to pierce at the Sundance. The Cheyenne, according to Dana, have a Sundance that is very much an endurance event. Dana is a physically active guy. He works construction building hotels. He said the Sundance is really hard to accomplish.  I’ve heard the word “Commitment” many times during the last four days. Today the leaders get pierced.  Billie passed an impressive pile of hot rocks into the sweat lodge. They sparkled. Spirits soared.  Enjoyed my first shower in four days under a garden hose. It felt great. Billie served up quite a feast featuring chili Verde. Several of Butch and Billie’s friends joined us for a green chili feast and a wonderful conversation.  Butch called a friend who attends a nearby Methodist church to find out what time services start tomorrow morning. I plan to worship there before driving with David from Italy to Rapid City.  I found a pay phone in St. Francis and checked my voicemail. Returned  birthday greetings from my sister, my lawyer PH and my wife. Rochelle is not bored in my absence. She is juggling her career, her children and her pursuits with the same predictable unpredictability as life generally tosses to her. One of the better gifts I can give to her is not let myself be another time investment to juggle. I have a hunch she is making better progress without me in the house, so she has a couple of months to have stranglehold on her pyramid of needs before I return. After all, she is the one who is going to have to hear all the verbatim essays I deliver on “What I did on my Summer Sabbatical”. So will my faith community. Pray for them.  I felt very relaxed today and spent most of the afternoon dancing near the arbor or sitting and listening to the manly conversations at the camp. Calvin teased me again about my notebook and I told him I was only writing down the jokes that were really funny...so I didn’t have much to write thus far. I did write a general observation about what it feels like to be 45 years old. At 45, it is important to remember that people will judge you not on how much you know, but people will judge you on how much you know that is worth knowing

      It’s my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings I found a place where they could hear me when I sing — Josh Ritter  If I take the wings of the morning and settle at the farthest limits of the sea—even there your hand shall lead me.  — Psalm 139  The cook’s cabin keeps cranking out the meals to feed all the people. I sat with Francis Bird after eating breakfast this morning under the canvas tarps that cover the picnic table area.  “You live here in town?” “Yes.” “What do you do?”“I’m a healer. I heal the blind using the Lord’s tears.” Francis Bird tells the story of healing a blind man named Charlie Holy Bible. Francis made it rain. Charlie crossed himself in Roman Catholic fashion. Francis used the Lord’s tears to heal him. Francis Bird is a holy man. Francis Bird is a healer.  This afternoon I sat across the table from Iceman. He said, “ Dan, Dan, Dan.. You know these things. Let me ask you—”Why are you still a Christian?”  I said, “My ancestors were Christians.”  Iceman answered, “Not a good reason.”  I laughed and gave him an answer similar to one given by LDS historian Jan Shipps when she was asked the same question but I added that the Christ in people I knew gave me great strength in my darkest hour. I can’t ever forget that.”  Returning to camp, I sat next to New Mexico David. He is very knowledgeable about the Sundance. A good guy to have around, David will make sure you do things correctly when approaching the ritual. He brought his brother Dan and his two sons to the Sundance. I sat next to him and noticed a boy carrying a large puppy towards the fire pit. I had heard that Heyoka Warriors will strangle a puppy then boil it. A real Heyoka can fish the dog’s skull from the boiling water.  Today is healing day. Iceman and I stood still as we received blessings from the dancers. At the end of the healing ritual, Iceman whispers to me, “Now we go from the good to the bad.” The drum doubled in speed and volume and a new song was sung. As the Sundancers stood in a circle, the Heyokas danced wildly. The dog skull was held out for all to see. One Heyoka in black and white paint suddenly became a face I recognized. Francis Bird is a Holy Man. Francis Bird is a healer. Francis Bird is Heyoka.

      " Quality is the continuing stimulus which causes us to create the world in which we live.  All of it.  Every last bit of it.  It is the track that directs the train." —    Robert M. Pirsig - Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance     Very cold last night in the lower 40’s—I needed all five blankets. It is cold an overcast today. Some of the Sundancers are shivering even though they sweated this morning prior to the first dance session. Most of the white dancers are sunburned. There is one black dancer. I am amazed more by the endurance factor of dancing all day than the piercings. I am also amazed at the drums—they sing one song that lasts for the entire dance session. Some of these sessions last up to two hours!  I visited the St. Francis Indian School today. The driveway runs through a couple dozen modular homes used by the school staff. When you face west, you can see a light purple steeple overlook the playground and tennis courts. I tried to enter the sanctuary but it was locked. I couldn’t find a priest anywhere on the campus.  Part of the campus is the Buechel Memorial Lakota Museum named after the Jesuit priest Eugene Buechel. He came to South Dakota from Holland in 1902 to minister to the people who gave him the name “Black Eagle”. During his 52 years with the Lakota, he published three books in Lakota language. After his death, his compilation of almost 30,000 words were assembled and published in a LAKOTA-ENGLISH DICTIONARY. In 1947, the museum was built to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Buechel as a Jesuit. Most of the displays are from his collection including a fully-beaded baptismal cap for an infant and two sets of ghost dance clothes.  I watched another round of piercing today standing next to a fellow equal to my size from Pensacola, Florida. His name is Iceman. His twin brother is a Sundancer. Iceman has a wicked sense of humor.  Some of the dancers were suspended from the tree by the chest piercings. One dancer hung for quite some time flapping two wing fans as if he was flying. It was a very impressive sight. More dancers pulled the seven buffalo skulls.  The people from Rosebud are Sicangu Lakota. Little Thunder was a great leader of the Sicangu Lakota after Conquering Bear’s death. As immigrants traveling to Montana and California they passed through Sicangu hunting reserves. Confrontations with Little Thunder’s security guards would lead to the Sioux Wars. Chief Little Thunder lived from 1827-1879, so I found it interesting that his bio in the museum says that when he was hampered by old age, he turned over his leadership to Spotted Tail. He was only 52 when he died! Sadly, that is still about 5 years passed the average lifespan for a reservation Indian man.  A young man from St. Francis—Francis Bird sat at the end of our camp table slowly smoking a cigarette and staring at me. He seemed to be under the influence of something. After he left, Iceman told me that I needed to talk to him before the Sundance is over. According to Iceman, Francis Bird is a holy man.

       You can’t do anything in life if it doesn’t have meaning.  The cottonwood tree represents the Creator that gives us life on the earth. The cottonwood tree is very important.  (smiling) I don’t trust people who write in notebooks all of the time .   —- Calvin Jumping Bull  Reggie Left Hand Bull brought a group of about 20 Air Force Medical Reservists here to study alternative medicine. They were mostly interested in the sweat lodges. Frank talked to them for awhile.  Multiple sessions of dancing today. The dancers enter and exit from the West entrance to the arbor into a pine covered lodge. It is quite a sight to see them emerge. The arena has a perimeter marked with sage. We are not to cross the sage perimeter.  At the end of each session, some of the dancer’s pipes are handed to individuals outside the perimeter. The receiver accepts the pipe and takes it to a group and they smoke it. David handed me a pipe and the bowl fell off. The woman who brought the pipe gasped. We were being careful, but I felt terrible about it. David told Uncle Frank what happened and he gave a “Pipe 101” lecture over the microphone—explaining to the Sundancers that the bowl needs to fit the stem tightly. Although I wasn’t blamed for the incident (thanks be to God) I was extra cautious about handling any pipe handed to me for the rest of the Sundance.  Pipe wisdom ; Store your pipe away from your home. When you fill the pipe you start by facing the West, then North, East, South, Up, Down and to the Great Mystery. No animals should be around when you fill the pipe. You plug the tobacco with a hunk of sage. When you light the pipe, remove the sage plug first. Frank said, “When you handle a pipe it’s like handling a loaded gun. Stem to the left. You hand it to another with the stem facing straight up, not pointing towards another human being.”  Today the piercing began. I was surprised to see women get pierced. They receive the piercings on their upper arms. Men are pierced either on the chest or back. Two slices with either an eagle claw or a scalpel then a small piece of wood the size of a dowel rod is inserted between. Ted Bodga, the man who made the teasing signs for Reggie and Calvin dragged seven buffalo skulls from his back piercings. He is a local school administrator.  David, from Italy, got a call that the airline found his luggage and sent it to the Artichoker house. Uncle Frank asked me to give David a ride to Butch and Billie Artichoker’s home on the other side of the town of Rosebud. David and I had a great conversation on the trip—he wrote his graduate thesis on the Sundance for a university in Milan. I thought we would stop, throw the luggage in the van and move on, but Butch and Billie are exceptional hosts and we stayed there for several hours.  Butch is the director of Economic Development for the Rosebud Nation. He is currently making plans to build a full service truck stop next to the Rosebud casino, but like many development projects there is some political opposition. I sensed immediately that he is a deeply spiritual man. He works periodically as a private hypnotherapist—has some pretty famous clientele. I asked him if the churches were doing anything productive on the reservation and sadly he couldn’t think of anything. He grew up on the Pine Ridge Rez which has many Roman Catholic and Episcopal communities, but he said the people are returning to the traditional spiritual practices. He said that the Episcopals and Roman Catholics need to come up with rituals as inviting as the Sundance.  Billie grew up in Navajo country. She earned a degree in police science. Important today, Billie is a tremendous cook. Had a dinner of buffalo and chicken with a side of fresh peaches.  They invited David and I to sweat with them on Saturday at 11 am. “We sweat every week” I am very thankful that Frank sent me to visit with the Artichokers.

       White buffalo calf woman came from God and brought the sacred pipe and rules for the Sundance. The pipe says forgiveness. You do not change the ceremony God has given us.” — Uncle Frank  Red and yellow, black and white. They are precious in his sight. — a Sundance bumper sticker.   It is 8 am and already so much has happened I can’t write it all down. At 5 am the coyotes were singing and a truck drove through camp blaring it’s horn. I heard the Chief loudly ask, “What’s the holdup? Let’s go! Let’s go!” Soon Calvin Jumping Bull was on the microphone telling us that it was time to get up. Calvin sang us a song. Temperature was 38 degrees at 5 am.  I walked to the dance arbor. A very nice man from Billings, Montana told me that my coat looks like one Roger Mance used to wear. I told him that Roger gave me the coat before he died. He shook my hand.  Just as the eastern sky lit up, the drum fired up. 47 men and 22 women danced in single file into the east entrance of the arbor. The sage was moved and the #10 tin cans with handles were smudging the dancers. The sage was replaced after all the dancers entered. It was quite a spectacle—bright red clothing and the magnificent tree of many colors.  The men were either barefoot or wore moccasins. They were all bare chested wearing aprons, mostly red. About half of the men had scars on their chests and backs from previous Sundancing. Sage wrapped in red cloth were worn as headbands and anklets. About half of the men had two feathers sticking up from the sage headbands. The women wore sage headbands also that looked like halos. All the men carried a pipe. All the women carried bird wing fans.  The dancers all sleep in the same area near the sweat lodges. I believe they sweated just prior to this morning’s dance session. Uncle Frank gave this explanation: “Do not touch the dancers. They are grounded. Contacted to the Mother Earth and to the Father through the tree. They will bring balance to the earth for one more year. Only the leaders can touch the dancers, but we would rather wait to shake your hands until Sunday at the end of the Sundance. This is not a powwow. It is a sacred ceremony. You do not change the ceremony God has given us. I know some of you won’t like this, but we sing the same songs, uwipi, same songs.”  I gave Reggie Left Hand Bull, the lead singer for the drum an abalone shell wrapped in sweet grass and filled with cough drops.  The dancers blew eagle bone whistles and many had canes with eagle heads on top. They danced around the perimeter of the circle then would periodically move to the center and touch the tree. Then walk backwards to the perimeter. Small groups of the dancers would move again to the center and touch the tree and pray. One man got on his knees and was moving in a circle with Keith in a bonnet walking around him and leading him. They stopped and raised their hands to each of the four directions.  A Lakota man standing next to me said, “I bet you are wondering why that man is on his knees” “Yep” “He had a dream of being a buffalo. He is a good man.” I asked, “Have you ever Sundanced?” He started undoing his shirt as if to show me the scars on his chest then he grinned broadly and said, “Never have. I just say ‘No’”. He went on, “I’ve been taught that you have to have the dream first. It can take four years of questing to get that dream.” I asked, “Should you tell someone else your dream?” “You can”, he said, “but it is better to write it down. If you tell someone, it should be someone you really trust.”  The sign at the entrance to camp reads: The Holy Circle Sundance Orin Horse Looking, Sr. Memorial Campgrounds. Hocokan Wakan Wiwong Wacipi. Orin Horse Looking, Sr. is buried nearby. He died shortly after Christmas last year. This is a solemn day, but everyone is in good spirits. Lots of humor and good-natured teasing. Two signs made me laugh:  Sir Reggie Left Hand Bull Camp Mayor of China Town Indian name: Old Geezer, sometimes known as Old Coot Second best singer in Camp Master of the Luke Warm Sweat  Calvin Jumping Bull’s Running Water Mine Waconi 1. Take bucket 2. Run to stock tank 3. Fill bucket 4. Run back 5. Pour into funnel 6. Turn on 7. Fill bucket 5 cents per glass  The Cedar Springs Singers are drumming a flag song now. I’ll write more tomorrow.

      Arrived at the Sundance grounds around 2 o’clock. Found Uncle Frank who smiled and said, “Dan, I was worried that you weren’t going to make it. I thought you got lost or something.” He likes to tease me. Frank introduced me to a fellow named John Culpepper. I knew his name. My friend Mike Fletcher from Athens, Ohio told me several times about John and that I should look him up whenever I was in Southern California. John and his wife Lisa live in Pasadena. John introduces me to his father-in-law Carl Heidel, a Lutheran minister—he went to seminary with my friend from Monterey Bay Anton Prange. As the people say here “We are all related”.  As I was getting acquainted with the group sitting around a picnic table, Chief Calvin Jumping Bull looked up and said, “The tree is here”. At the top of the hill came a huge cottonwood tree being carried by fifty or so people—men and women. Four young men in feather bonnets walked in front of the tree along with Keith—the arena director. Several women were carrying #10 tin cans attached to cut off broom handles. Some of the cans were filled with burning sage. Others with burning cedar. They smudged everyone and everything.  The tree was carried to the center of the dance arbor. The entrance to the arbor was a road of fresh sage that runs around the inner parameter of the arbor. The caravan took off their shoes and as each entered the arbor they raised their hands into the air and spun around. They all did that on the way out of the arbor, too. Ropes were tied to the top of the cottonwood tree. Ribbons symbolizing the people’s prayers were tied to the branches. Red, black, white and yellow knots were wrapped around the trunk of the tree to symbolize the four directions. Many people pulled the tree to a standing position using the ropes and Chief Keith Horse Looking instructed them to wrap up and tie the ropes so they were all suspended in the air. The tree was especially chosen because it had a fork. It symbolizes a human being lifting up his/her arms in prayer. One drum sang a long song as the people brought the tree to the arbor. Another drum sang a long song as the tree was prepared and raised.  Following the tree raising came a wonderful dinner with several stews, and hot pie filling served like choke cherry pudding. Boxes of clothes were laid out for people who wanted them. It was a good thing because a young man named David came here from a small town near Venice, Italy and the airline lost his luggage. He has a garbage bag full of clothes to get him through the week.  I took a nap in my van—thanks to my friend Jackie Burns loaning me an excellent air mattress. Of course, when I woke up and joined the group, they teased me that I missed two big giveaways and I probably would have liked the buffalo robe someone wanted to give me. The part about the giveaways is true, but I strongly doubt there was a buffalo robe with my name on it.  A fellow from Rosebud named Izzy walked up to me and asked if I had a flashlight. He lost the key to his Chevy van and needed to get home so he could take his insulin shot. I fished out a big flashlight from my van and we searched for about a half an hour. One woman told Izzy that some kids found a key and it was supposed to be taken to Uncle Frank. Sure enough, Frank had the key. I got to tease him by asking, “Did you want to watch Izzy and me walk around for a half an hour for entertainment, Frank?”  It was an especially cool overcast day here today. Felt like I was in Pacific Grove. As I spent most of the evening in a short-sleeved cotton shirt, I saw many people with heavy jackets shivering. I let a few folks borrow blankets from me.  There are four sweat lodges set up near the arbor with a huge pit for a huge fire. They had over 20 stones baking today but I haven’t seen anyone using the sweat lodges tonight. Since there are no shower facilities here, I’m pretty sure I’ll be doing a sweat or two before the week is over. Kind of funny to hear Uncle Frank introduce me to a few folks by saying, “This is Dan. He is a Christian minister, but he sweats.”  Tomorrow Frank and Calvin will fire up the PA system at 5 am to wake us up to celebrate the sunrise and the dancers will begin the ordeal. They were not to touch water after noon today—not drink or wash in it. Water is the source of life and the dancers have committed themselves to give up their lives to God this week. It is a very rigorous baptism

      DAY EIGHT  Christian leaders cannot simply be persons who have well-informed opinions about the burning issues of our time. Their leadership must be rooted in the permanent, intimate relationship with the incarnate Word, Jesus, and they need to find there the source for their words, advice and guidance. — Henri J. M. Nouwen  Visited Mary’s sanctuary and office this morning. Then off to see two of the three places where JC works. My unfailing litmus test to see whether or not I am still a worship nerd comes from the energy I get when I walk into a place of worship. It is a lovely notion to me that people have found and continue to find the motivation to create a special place to think about the Creator and the Christ. After the initial passing of the litmus test, I always catch myself looking for the artistic intent—imagining what led to the aesthetic decisions the powers-that-be made to design the stained glass or coordinate the chancel space. If I’m lucky, I get enough time to really drink in the room and feel the presence of the cloud of witnesses who have blessed the space. Often I get a feeling of soul expansion at these moments.  I got a driving tour of the Omaha and the Winnebago Reservations. We visited a mission supported by the Dutch Reformed church run by Pastor Earl. He hired a couple of Winnebago teens to fix a couple of broken windows that the insurance will cover. In between finding food and tools to borrow for some local folks, Earl told me that the Reformed Church has six mission stations for work with Natives—two in Nebraska. The denomination has all of the mission directors compare notes periodically. He partners with all of the local churches (including JC’s) to keep a serious food bank in operation.  Quickly walked the campus of the college that was my #2 choice for undergraduate studies. Dana College in Blair sits at the top of a residential area with a grassy campus. I was hoping my old friend Paul Johnson still worked there (he tried to recruit me to attend Dana 27 years ago) but he has moved on. Gosh. Maybe he retired? The cost of a freshman tuition and board is about $20,000 — $12,000 less than my alma mater charges currently.  At the top of the hill sits a memorial to Black Elk. John Neihardt the poet who had long conversations with the Oglala Holy Man and penned “Black Elk Speaks” lived in this area. A pathway around the top of the hill has markers for the four directions that are cement pillars with mosaic designs to show the direction, the color for that direction and an aspect of that direction. The memorial itself was designed by an art professor emeritus from Dana College. The sculpture includes images of a cross, tree of life, circle and the four directions.  Today is the bicentennial celebration of when Lewis and Clark came along the Missouri River here. We briefly chatted with a few of the recreationists who are replicating the expedition in replica boats and replica clothing.  We stopped at a farm to visit a member of JC’s congregation. She gave us a large box of fresh-picked vegetables which JC is now preparing for dinner. Just going to relax this evening so I can get an early start tomorrow to attend tree day on the Rosebud Rez.

       To live a life that is not dominated by the desire to be relevant but is instead safely anchored in the knowledge of God’s first love, we have to be mystics. A mystic is a person whose identity is deeply rooted in God’s first love. —- Henri J. M. Nouwen   This quote comes from a book that was given to me by Jeff Wright, Senior Pastor of Heart of the Rockies Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). It is his tradition to give a copy of Nouwen’s book to colleagues taking sabbaticals. A fine gift from a fine man who gave a very fine sermon this morning as only a mystic can give.  This has been a very eventful day of spending small amounts of time with mystics. That and a day full of large amounts of time driving.  Steve Eulberg did a radio interview on a spirituality talk show early this morning. A fine host he is. Brought me back a cappuccino to get me fired up for a 20 minute drive to Heart of the Rockies. Steve and Connie have been excellent hosts. They took me to a surprise party to celebrate a friend’s graduation from graduate school. Then Steve and I went to the Kiva Records Studio. Steve laid down two excellent tracks yesterday on the hammered dulcimer for the new recording project. By the time we returned home, Connie had kebobs all cut up and ready to bbq. Kaitlyn then came up with a grand idea to visit Ben and Jerry’s Ice Cream store. It’s been quite an honor to be an honorary Eulberg. I was promised a good time and I had one.  Driving to church I was thinking about the spirituality of hospitality. It is an art form. To be welcomed and sustained into the home of mystics gives the guest a glimpse of the realm of God.  So this is today’s church story.  Heart of the Rockies Christian Church meets in a 5 yr old building on the south end of Ft. Collins surrounded by recent housing developments. As I entered the beautiful building I was greeted by Tom Nix. A fine greeter, a fine man and I’m pretty sure he is a mystic too. As soon as he ascertained that I was a Disciples clergy, he marched me over to the Associate Pastor’s office and said, “Scott, there is someone here you probably want to meet.” Instantly Scott Hardin-Nieri grabbed my hand and said, “Dan Paul, how is Pacific Grove?” Sadly, it took me until the middle of the worship service to recall how I knew Scott. Turns out he and his wife Bekka stayed at the parsonage with us a couple of years ago for a Northern California-Nevada regional meeting of The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Rochelle and I invite seminarians to stay in our home during the annual meeting in Pacific Grove. After the service we had a little time to have a real conversation. Got to chat with Bekka a bit as well. In his sermon, Pastor Jeff told a story about one of the members of the congregation doing something spiritually heroic. It was a great story. As I was walking back to my van for the drive to JC and Mary’s house in Wayne, Nebraska I shook hands again with Tom Nix. Turns out that he was the spiritual hero of the pastor’s story. I could tell he was deeply moved and quite humbled. Yep, he is a mystic.  Eight and a half hours of driving today to reach JC and Mary’s home. They are mentors and mystics. JC was my pastor at the Willits United Methodist Church in the early 90’s. He also volunteered as a chaplain at two of the Boy Scout camps I directed then. Mary is also a fine pastor. She once gave me some grief counseling that was hugely helpful in a small, succinct letter. They both serve UMC churches in Wayne County. I’m very happy to be here.

      Sitting in Steve’s teaching room watching a flock of geese heading West. Steve set up the hammered dulcimer last night and we played through a couple of songs which we should manage to record later today at Kiva Records. It is supposed to get up to 90 degrees today, so I hope Kiva has air conditioning. Russ, the owner of Kiva, came to the Log Jam at the Yakama Mission with Steve a couple of years ago. He specializes in recording Native American drums.  Déjà Vu is a bona fide coffee house with organic everything, allegro coffee (better deal than fair trade) and wireless internet access. Steve was jamming away on a mountain dulcimer when I walked in and caught the last half hour of his performance. He told me to grab a CD from my van and led me across the street to a small radio station. They do a weekly show that reviews independent artists so I hope someday to get a tape from them of the review of World Without Walls. Amazing local music scene here in Ft. Collins—lots of small venues that hire artists to perform.  Steve’s wife Connie is a Lutheran chaplain at Colorado State University. We visited her office there. Signs in the window saying “No cash on premises”. There has been a string of church sanctuary robberies in Ft. Collins lately. The story about it is on the front page of the local paper today.  Steve and I stayed up late last night sharing songs, reminiscing and catching up.  Since Connie is not preaching tomorrow morning, I’ll be looking for a Disciples church to attend. Then I need to figure out where in Nebraska JC and Mary Browne live and make my way there. I hope to be on the Rosebud Rez by Tuesday for Tree Day.

      Good morning from the infamous Laramie, Wyoming. After visiting the Mormon Temple and driving near Columbine, Colorado last night, there is a whiff of weirdness in the air. I listened to Bill Clinton’s “My Life” book-on-tape to keep me awake while driving through the night. Laramie was as far as I felt I could safely travel. Racked up 13 hours of driving yesterday.  I was a seminary student when Matthew Shepard was murdered here. A Unitarian-Universalist colleague of mine with an interesting name— Paul Daniel (we used to get each other’s mail all of the time) was so moved by the Shepard murder that he immediately traveled to Laramie to offer pastoral care. I am still impressed with Paul’s sense of duty for that. He currently pastors a church in Las Vegas.  Only a little over an hour away from Ft. Collins, CO, so I should make it to the Déjà Vu– the restaurant where Steve Eulberg will be playing at lunchtime.

      This entry is being written from Border’s Bookstore with a view of the Mormon Temple. It was quite a walk across the temple square. I kept getting stopped by ambitious young missionaries. Temple square is full of people waiting in large groups to be the next admitted into the Tabernacle. I listened to the Tabernacle Choir as well as a Men’s Ensemble that was singing in the small worship center. The music was very white bread, but performed with precision and extraordinary dynamics.  There are two visitor’s centers on the compound—one at the North Gate and one at the South. The North Gate Center houses a model of the ancient Jerusalem temple. The walls tell the story of Jesus Christ in large oil paint illustrations from the Nativity to the Ascension— they aren’t terribly artistic and some of the renderings of Jesus make him look to be 50-60 years old. I tried to convert a Danish missionary to become a Disciple of Christ but failed. :-)  The South Gate Center seems to be focused on LDS family values— driving home the “God ordained” nuclear family of one man/one woman theory. One large sign claims to have words supporting the family by the Savior. There is one Biblical quote— “Suffer the little children to come unto me…” but the rest of the quotes come from Mormon documents. The quote, “Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?” is strikingly absent.   Taking a break in Temple Square after a 7 1/2 hour drive through the Great Basin to the Great Salt Lake. The drive was less-than-great save a small lightning storm and a long phone call from Chaplain Chris Williams from The Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula. A university student just told me I have a 10 hour drive to Ft. Collins from here. I’m hoping to make it there by noon tomorrow—Steve Eulberg is performing for the lunch crowd at a Ft. Collins restaurant.  Steve and I sang together in the Men’s Glee Club at Capital University. We survived Clovis Frank’s New Testament Greek class. Steve was a decent guitar player then, but has become a serious hammer dulcimer player and songwriter since then. I’ll be spending the weekend with Steve and his family. Steve’s wife is also an ordained Lutheran minister working as a university chaplain.  The strategically-placed floodlights just lit up the temple top. Pretty against the darkening sky. Looks like something you would expect to see in Washington DC.  Border’s closes in 10 minutes, so it is time hike back to my car and drive East. Many thanks to the folks from the church who sent me with the care package. Been enjoying the snacks on this long drive.

      The last sabbatical I took lasted nine years. To completely oversimplify the reason, let’s just say I was depressed over a girl. It isn’t unprecedented. I lived in Willits CA (town of about 4,000 people at the time) keeping a rag tag dance band working the honkytonks, brew pubs, rodeos and community dances. It wasn’t hard work and once I had a fairly steady calendar I only worked four hours a day.  This sabbatical has nothing to do with depression, in fact I believe I accomplished something Faye Orton told me— “The secret to sabbatical is taking it before you absolutely need it”. Before you completely exhaust, I suppose. I feel pretty good these days for a three-hundred-pound, middle-aged white guy. Not bad shape for the shape I’m in. Literally.  I’ve been sitting in the Deux Gros Nez Café in downtown Reno trying to figure out how to connect this laptop computer to the wireless hotspot they sponsor here. No luck… and my waiter tried to get it to connect for twenty minutes. So, I will make my Deux Gros Nez time a time of sipping wonderfully strong coffee, writing this blog, and write a few long letters to good friends I left behind. One good friend, Pat Bruce offered to buy me breakfast here — he’s not here right now, but he works here. Deux Gros Nez sits above a wine store decorated with competitive bicycling memorabilia. Gore-Tex shirts framed and signed fill the walls and eclectic jazz plays loudly over the stereo system. As long as my hair is getting, I have the shortest hair in the room. Artistic and thinking types hang out here. Birkenstocks and jeans with holes in the knees.  I’ve been growing my hair for the last couple of months. I’ve been trying to figure out how to blend in when I get to Rosebud Rez. Rochelle said to me a few weeks ago, “Spouse— you don’t blend!” She has a way of saying things like that to me that doesn’t sound too harsh. Nice quality to have in a wife.  When I finish writing here, I will hike back to my room (laptop in backpack— really makes me look like a white liberal) and plan the next leg of this trip. The idea is to arrive in Ft. Collins, Colorado by Friday to spend a couple of days with Steve Eulberg. Steve is an ordained Lutheran minister who was a fellow student at Capital University with me twenty five years ago. He is currently one of the most accomplished hammer dulcimer players in the world. I hoping Steve can lay down some hammer dulcimer tracks over the weekend to use on the new album. One of Steve’s best friends owns a studio in Ft. Collins that should have everything we need to do the job.  This evening I will be dining at Colin and Yolanda’s house. Colin has a PhD in Mathematics and likes to fly planes. He has a steady gig towing gliders up to the constant winds of Reno heat. Colin was jumping up and down on Stan’s parent’s couch holding a beer the first time I met him at Stan’s long-awaited graduation from the university. Yolanda works as a California Highway Patrol officer at the truck scales between Truckee and Donner’s Summit. We were comparing notes yesterday afternoon about having a profession that inhibits a lot of close relationships. Think about it. If you were at a party and you ended up in a conversation with Yolanda and myself, how comfortable would you be letting your hair down with a cop and a preacher?

      On Sunday morning, The Christian Church of Pacific Grove gave me a tremendous send off. During the section of the worship service given to prayers of the people, all elders in attendance thoughtfully presented me with a new journal and then offered a sending prayer.  Lots of well wishes, a pot luck dinner, and a care package full of low carb snacks and gift items folks from the congregation figured I could use while driving around America’s mainland for three months.  I am on sabbatical. My covenant with the Christian Church grants me this three month period at the end of every five years of service as it’s pastor. When I earned the Masters of Divinity from the Pacific School of Religion in 1999, I asked some elder clergy to mentor me. Most of them strongly recommended that I request periodic Sabbatical time and that no matter what is going on in the church, I take it. It evidently is a self-care issue.  The initial covenant (contract) with the church was negotiated in the pastor’s study (my office) with the president of the congregation and the chief financial officer. I was working through my last semester of seminary studies and I didn’t have much time to think about what I needed to bring to the discussion. I contacted my regional minister and he said, “Did anyone tell you to insist on sabbatical time?” So I entered the conversation fully aware that the only thing that was a deal-breaker was getting sabbatical time which we agreed would be a three month time off, every five years. The problem was that the initial covenant was for one year and somehow we decided that the language about sabbatical didn’t need to be included until my fifth annual covenant was written. It was a problem, because this delicate meeting discussing my salary, benefits, and other expectations was not heralded to the congregation. As year four approached, I began to talk about making plans for my sabbatical at a Board of Director’s meeting and some of the Director’s gave me the deer-in-the-headlights mug. They demanded, “Who told you that you would get that much time off?” Thanks be to God cool heads prevailed and the initial discussion was remembered. The current Board of Elders wrote the sabbatical language into my fifth annual covenant.  What is a sabbatical? I plan to collect wisdom about this question during the next three months. Steve Eulberg called today to say “Happy Sabbatical”. Steve was driving by a evangelical church with God Doesn’t Take A Vacation! on the marquis. He thought to himself, “Sure God takes vacation… we call it Sabbath.” Sabbatical is a time of rest and refreshment. Dr. Dick Hamm said to me, “One thing you need to remember about sabbatical time— don’t be the pastor!” Words like low-stress, self-examination and filling the cup come into the sabbatical conversation. I’ll take special note of wise people who give me their definitions of sabbatical in the next few months.
