      Well, Evan forgave me and I told Chris to stop calling. Dee and I have been talking even more than we did in the first place and everyone's happy. I've been to the mall twice this past week and my collection of summer clothes has grown a lot! Tomorrow I have to go to a banquet for Dee's pageant and then Evan and I are going out for a bite to eat. Thursday is the big day of the pageant. Dee is nervous, but I have a good feeling about it. I think she'll win something. So, good luck to you Dee! :) I know this post is really short, but, I have got to go and eat before I die of starvation!     ♪: Jadakiss - Why Mood: Hungry

      Well, as I said in my last post, Chris has been calling me. He called me Sunday and yesterday too. I saw nothing wrong with talking to him so I always answered and talked to him for a while. Well okay, so it was more like a few hours. But that's not the point. Evan came here yesterday as soon as he got back in town. He was playing with my phone when--surprise surprise--Chris called. I snatched the phone from Evan before he had the chance to answer it and start to bitch. I hit the "decline" button as quickly as I could and sent the call to my voicemail. But Evan had already realized what has been going on because I had told him about the call at 4 a.m. when Dee answered. He stormed out without even giving me the chance to explain and only called once later that night--to talk to Dee. Luckily, my sister gave me the chance to tell her what has been happening. She listened to my side of the story, and didn't turn her back on me. She's still just the same as she was. She told me that if I really wanted to, she wouldn't give me a hard time about anything I did with him. However, she also told me that if he fucks up, she'll be sure to step in. College or no college she's going to be a big part of this. I love her for that. Now all I have to do is decide what I want.    ♪: VH1 Mood: Confused

      Today Dee is off work again. She gets Sundays and Mondays off. This week, she gets only Sunday off because she took Friday off. It's the busiest day at the restaurant. We aren't doing anything special today. I guess all I'll be doing is getting online and watching TV. Evan is at a family reunion in Ohio somewhere. He isn't going to be back until tomorrow evening. Chris called again last night while Dee was at work. I talked to him for almost two hours. He told me that he was sorry that he called at 4 a.m. on Friday. Then, he went ahead and started telling me all about how much he missed me. He said that he was sorry for what he did to me. This made me think. Does he really mean it? Is he only apologizing because his girlfriend refuses to give him a piece of ass? All I know is that he wants me back. I'm not sure what to make of it.     ♪: Aaliyah - More Than A Woman Mood: Okay?

      I tried to post yesterday while Dee was at practice, but my connection fucked up and Evan wanted attention anyway.  Girls Day Out was fun. Dee and I took a trip to the mall and shopped around for a bit. I bought a few cute tops from Hollister and an anklet. After shopping, we ate at the Outback and had a nice little bonding session since we hadn't been able to talk much in the past two weeks or so. We came home close to 6 and she went to practice. Evan came to the house and kept me 'busy' for about 45 minutes until Dee came home, showered, and got ready to leave. At 8:30 we met Nate at the movies and saw Raising Helen. I liked it, but, didn't really get to watch most of it. Yeah, you know what I'm saying. After the movie we went for pizza at Little Ceasers and came home around 11:45. Dee and I stayed up until almost 4 a.m. talking, without even noticing how late it was getting. The phrase, "Time flies when you're having fun." is so very true that it kills me. So, around 4:15 a.m. we're lying in bed and my cell phone rings. Wtf. Dee, acting on impulse, rolls over grabs the phone and answers it without even looking to see who the hell is calling. The conversation goes something like this: [Answers] "Hello?" ... "Why the -fuck- are you calling my baby sister?" ... "No, don't even fucking give me that. I don't want you're dirty ass anywhere near her." ... "No. Don't ever call here again jackass." [Hangs up] From this, I knew exactly who it was that had called.  I guess now would be the appropriate time to fill you in on the way things were before Evan and I got together. There was this guy, I'll call him Chris, that I met a little over two years ago. He and I talked for half a year. We hit it off very well, our personalities seemed to be a perfect match. Chris was my first love. Or, maybe it was lust. Either way, I fell for him. Boy, did I fall. To me, Chris had no flaws at all. He always told me how perfect I was. He wouldn't say things like "You're perfect", he'd say things more along the lines of "You're eyes are perfect", or "I love how absolutely perfect your freckles are placed on your nose". He'd make it known that every single part of me was perfect. But, long story short, he ended up having sex with my best friend and I found out that he's a damn good player. Evan saw all of this unfold. While I was talking to Chris, Ev and Dee were fairly good friends and so he heard all about what happened with the family. In the past 18 months he's came so close to killing Chris that it was scary. So anyways. He called. Dee bitched. All was well five minutes later. I know I'm cutting that story really short and I apologize. I just don't like talking about it anymore than I see fit. Now I'm going to go shave my hairy legs before the hair consumes me and I am known as cousin it by my family, friends, and neighbors.     &#9834;: None Mood: Tired

      Last night when Dee came home, she walked in my room and told me she took tomorrow (today) off. She said that I can't see Evan today, and that she won't be seeing Nate. We're going to have a "girls day out". Hehe. Later tonight, after her Pageant practice, we're going to meet up with the boys and hang out for awhile. I'm very excited. I think we might be going to the mall and when we're with the boys we may go to the movies, but we haven't decided on that yet. I guess now I should go get in the shower and put all my makeup on and stuff, since Dee is out of the bathroom.     ♪: TLC - Good Love Mood: Excited

      I know this is my third post for today but I feel like writing.  I guess I should go ahead and tell you about Dee so you can understand and it will be out of the way. I'm so close to my sister that I can't imagine things without her. I can't remember a time when we fought. Sure, we've argued a few times, but those arguments lasted only an hour or so. We've always been the best of friends. Nothing will ever compare to the relationship that I've formed with Dee. As I told you earlier, she is the reason my parents allowed me to be with Ev. She has been my shoulder to cry on many times throughout the years. I love her so much for all that she's done for me. I've never regretted a moment with her. Anytime that she needs me, I'll be there. I would drop everything for her, no questions asked. We've been through more together than anyone can ever know. I love my sister with all my heart. Lately though, things have been difficult. I only see her in the early hours of the morning. She works her ass off, while still trying to make time for her boyfriend, her pageantry, and her friends. I understand that she can't exactly see me as much as she used to. She just graduated 18 days ago. Two days after graduation she went to the beach for her senior trip. A week later she came back, but I didn't even see her until two days after. I knew that she had been home and she left me notes in the mornings before she went to work, but that doesn't replace actually seeing her. She works double shifts waitressing at a restaurant to make up for the time she's missed with graduation and going on vacation. Between shifts she gets two hours off. She uses this time to see her boyfriend, Nate. This, I can understand completely because I would go to visit Evan every chance I got as well. After her time there is up she goes back to work for another 5 hours. At around 7 p.m. she goes to practice for a pageant she will be in within the next three weeks. Afterwards she goes to see Nate again. She has been given a curfew of midnight. She always makes this curfew. She's fine with having it. In all honestly I think she likes having a reason to go home earlier than she would without it. If she had no curfew to make she would be out all hours of the night because she loves being with people and doesn't like leaving them but, with the curfew she can tell people that she needs to get home. She comes home around 11:45 and takes her shower. She gets out close to 12:05 and comes to my room to dress and talk to me. She falls asleep on my bed around 1. It's this way every night. She hasn't slept in her own bedroom since she came home from the beach. I like that we've been sharing a bed lately. I feel more secure. I love listening to her breathe at night. So predictable.. It never skips a beat. At some time in the night she rolls over and finds me, hugs me tightly to her, and we sleep this way. At times when I'm still awake and I'm just watching her sleep I notice she reaches for me several times. I love to just watch her sleep. It's one of the most peaceful things that I've ever experienced.  Soon she will be going away to college. I'm very proud of her. She graduated high school with a 3.9 Grade Point Average. She's getting a full scholarship to Alderson-Broaddus, one of the state's top schools. A-B is three hours away from home. That's 3 hours too many away from me. At first I was upset, I'd have done anything to get her to stay, but after a month or two of seeing how happy she was to get the opportunity, I became excited as well. In fact, I can't wait until she gets there. I'm very excited. She will have a lot of fun. Of course I'll miss her when she's gone. I'll miss her everyday when I wake up and she isn't going to be the one to take me to school. Nonetheless, I still can't wait. Since this post is really long and I've only been babbling for ages, I'm going to go. Only two hours until the schedule with Dee starts again.    &#9834;: Staind - For You Mood: Giddy

      I love not having school. Even though I like going to school and seeing everyone I love being able to be with Evan whenever I want for as long as I want. Evan and I have been together for 15 months now. I've never felt anything as strong as the love that I feel for him. some say that high school love isn't real. I disagree. The love that I share with Evan is the only real thing I've ever felt. I'd do anything for him and vice versa. He's the best thing to ever happen to me (With the exception of being born into a good family with the best older sister anyone could ask for). His friends are my friends, and mine are his. He is my best friend and I trust him just as much as I do my sister (I'll tell more about her in a later post). He gives me everything I could ever ask for. He can make me feel like nothing wrong could ever happen. I couldn't ask for anything more than what I find in him. He gets along with my family and they love him as if he were their own child. In the beginning my father didn't approve of my sweet Evan. He's 17 years old. He recently graduated from my high school and he'll be attending college in the fall. Basically, they don't like that he and my sister are the same age. However, Dee, being the wonderful sister that she is, used the fact that they were in the same class to my benefit. She was able to give our parents a rundown of what a great guy he was and how much he liked me. After a bit of persuading, the parents agreed to allow Evan and I to be together, and now, a year and three months later, here we are.
