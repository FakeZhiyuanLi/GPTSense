      well sunday i went to great america with my friend Heather and her parents. it was alot of fun and i really enjoyed spending time with her becuz i havent really talked to her in a long time and i forgot how much fun she is. we went on this viking ship ride and i hate going upside down on rides and on this one we did and i didnt like it at all. i felt like i was going to fall out of my seat and hit the people on the other side and then fall in the water and like die from the hits. we were sitting next to these little like maybe ten year olds and they were laughing at us becuz we were screaming cuz i was scared and in pain. it had the saftey bar over your head that you pull down that cut right across my boobs and hurt really bad, and then the bar that goes between your legs which wasnt as bad. earlier her dad found a basketball rolling on the dock and gave it to me and when we went on the ride i set it off to the side and when we got off it was gone. we got soaked from the water rides and bumped by the bumper cars, she got ganged up on by me and these three other guys it was great i just started to laugh and laugh. i guess though over all my day was really fun and it beats sittin at home all day which i probably would have done if i didnt go.

      you went away in a flash of light never to return  people said you'd leave me and break my heart i didnt want to believe them i thought they were wrong  even though you hurt before i thought you had changed but you didnt and never will  i knew something was up when you called me from the airport you said you were sorry but i didnt care  i wanted you gone and out of my life i knew i was safe when you called that night

      fights may happen guys may come  ill never leave no matter what  nothing has come between us not guys or friends  nothing can break our friendship not even true love  our friendship was like a diamond nothing could break it  now its like steel  melting away  we need to fix the break in the bar or our friendship will end like kids in a candy shop  we can mend it back but it will never be as great what has happened now we can only fix  we may go our seperate ways in years to come but still we shall be friends  we'll be in each others weddings with smiling faces cuz they made the right choice  ill be by your side if you ever get ill and ill send cards every christmas  i hope you do the same so our friendship never ends cuz if it does then i shall dies inside  if i shall die inside from emptyiness without you then i know i will have failed in the most important thing  friendship is like oxygen  you cant live without it   no matter how hard you try it will never disappear

      when i left i felt relief you made me feel helpless, scared and frightened. my friends told me to leave you, but i didnt want to believe it. they said you were a jerk and that i didnt deserve it. i wanted to believe them but i didnt see what they meant. you came home in a rage and took it out on me, i dont understand what i did to deserve this. i cleaned and cooked and never talked back, but you didnt care you wanted me gone. i tried to stay away from you, and out of your way, i didnt apologize because i didnt do anything wrong. i had no reason to stay when you were wrong. so i went away because you wanted me gone. i left when you werent home so you couldnt stop me, i needed to leave to be free and on my own.

      people say they care but most never mean it  people say they love you and some never do  men say they can change but never really do  woman say they're sorry and usually mean it  kids say i love you but dont always know what it mean  not everyone means what they say and not everyone says what they mean  people are dumb and some inconsiderate and some will never change  maybe for the best others for the worse  people can be mean and very cruel doesnt mean you have to be cruel back  they may hurt you in a way that you want to hurt them  never give in to those who are mean dont get mad when you can get glad
