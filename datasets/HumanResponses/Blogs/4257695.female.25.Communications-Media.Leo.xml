      My home computer has been out of commission since Saturday afternoon when my apartment was struck by lightning.  Image: Me in my baby pink pajamas, pink Yankees visor on slightly sideways, dancing with my roommate's cocker spaniel puppy to Lil' Kim's "How Many Licks," when suddenly we hear the absolute loudest crash ever. Pan left to window where an actual lightning bolt is visible. It would be hard to tell whether my screaming and jumping around were part of my reaction to the lightning or the song. I think I scared the dog more than the lightning bolt did.  Anyway, apparently my surge protector didn't do its job properly. I'm not sure what scared me more; the freakish six-inch-wide bolt of white energy three inches away from my bedroom window, or the fact that I now have no way to post on my blog from home.

      Order a white cosmopolitan and  urlLink they'll  serve it in a glass garnished with a purple orchid. When I saw that I was mesmerized. So the bartender took my nonalcoholic cranberry and seltzer and garnished it with a purple orchid of its own.  "It perked up when I put it in for you," he said as I blushed.  I love purple orchids in my drinks. As much as the bartenders that put them there.

      Out of sheer boredom today I counted the number of steps at the 5th Avenue/53rd Street subway stop when you come from the Queensbound E train to street level and walk up the moving escalator. The number I arrived at was 104. This seemed like a lot until I put it into perspective. Some of the highest buildings in which I've climbed the steps are:   urlLink Cape Hatteras Lighthouse  - 268 steps  urlLink Statue of Liberty  - 354 steps  urlLink Torre Asinelli  in Bologna - 498 steps  urlLink Empire State Building  - 1,575 steps  Kinda makes me think maybe I should just shut up and start working out more. I bet, though, that there are about as many subway steps from the F train to street level at the Lexington Avenue/63rd Street station as there are in the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse. Hm... something to investigate.

      Hooray! Yesterday my best friend  urlLink Siggi  was officially accepted into the Peace Corps. She will be leaving for  urlLink Namibia  in October. Just need to give props to my girl - what she's doing is so awesome and so brave. And while she'll be off doing incredible things for the people of Namibia, she should also know that I'll be counting the days until December 2006 when she returns.

      A day goes by with nothing to mark it but an "x" on the calendar. My feet have moved one in front of another mechanically as if pulled by some outside source. Tuesday was the same as Monday and Monday was the same as Sunday. Two days back from vacation and already the rat race has reclaimed me as its prime participant. Please, no more subways, no more Solitaire. I miss the salty air of the beach and the wind in my hair under sundrenched skies. Here there is nowhere to turn but to the gray concrete beneath my feet or the metallic surfaces of the valleys I cross on my way from and then back home. If I didn't know better I'd think I was sleepwalking, but I know this isn't a dream.

      So I've finally got a blog. I feel so... connected. It's hard to come up with something to post so early in the morning when so little has happened (made a strawberry-banana smoothie for breakfast that tasted pretty good and I checked out the General Hospital recap from yesterday's show but other than that I can't say much for August 17). Basically, this will be my spot to offer my musings on "stuff" (for lack of a better term). For instance, yesterday I learned that there are six lists of hurricane names that are rotated yearly, and if a hurricane is particularly devastating then the hurricane name is retired. In other words, you'll never see another Hurricane Andrew again, but Danielle will probably show her evil eye (pun intended) again in another six years now that she's blown out to sea. I also learned that there are no hurricane names for the letters Q, U, or Z. Lame. I'm sure we could come up with six names for those letters. But, uh, I'm not going to try right now.  There's plenty more where that came from but I've got to save some for later. I'm sure this has whet your appetite for more, though, hasn't it?
