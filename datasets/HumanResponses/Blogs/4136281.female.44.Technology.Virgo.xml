       Since I probably will kill the  sy_helpdesk  website and list after the summer break is over (nothing but a pain and everybody giving me negative vibes on it), I decided to create a blog site instead. If you care to know what's going on over here at my desk, or away from it, check in and read my blogs and feel free to talk back to me if you want to. Not sure how I will get the site info out to people, probably wouldn't be too ethical to use the schools email addresses; will have to hash that out with the powers that be. More later as interesting things develop. see ya! ;-)

       after what felt like a forty eight hour day, i finally got to go home.....these days that start at 5 am and end at 10 at night are starting to get real old. now that we're getting into full swing trying to get ready for school to start the second job hours will have to drop way back, at least for a couple months. getting lots of calls and emails for the help desk and lots of email info to set up and fix...everyone is getting back to their classrooms to see what's up and finding out that the summer cleaning has taken its toll on the set up of their equipment. We'll be chasing this stuff down right down to the very last second before school starts! the guys are working their tails off, but right now for every work order they sign off, there are two new ones! what has been a pleasant surprise so far is how nice people who have been calling have been, both in person and in voice mail...even the people who indicate that they have a kinda emergency (real or imagined) are very nice and have been asking for help just "as soon as you can; i know you guys are really busy"...hope we can service everyone well and can keep this feelgood thing rolling....with this kind of attitude, there is no limit to what we can get done!  exciting work continues toward our goal of a managed network...soon we will be training and practicing with all the new tools, so we can start implementation (slowly and in selective locations at first, them fully throughout the district) our department will get lots more done....we are excited about all the tools and hardware, in typical geek fashion.  better get to setting up some more email accounts and then catch a couple Zzzzz's... on to tomorrow, when we'll do it all again! talk to ya! ;-)

       finally got the email off to all the people that were nice enough to let me practice on with their email accounts with the SY_HELPDESK list.  I wanted to let everyone know as they are coming back to school that all the junk from me in their mailboxes was no good so they didn't drive themselves crazy trying to figure out what all the hoopla was all about.  I hope that the blog thing proves to be more fun...if nothing else since it is just me and my brain children (not a help desk tool, as such)  maybe some people will get curious and take a peek or even blog with me!  Hope so!   well, am at work at my night job, so will have to get back to it.  Will post again later when I get home (if I can keep my eyes open!)

       Found out from Greg that my blog is blocked by N2H2 at school....what a pain....I know it can be fixed, but I have to find the time and the info to do it. All the guys were working on getting schools put back together today...Matt worked at NV in the Pub to get it back up and networked; will have to set aside some time to see if we can get the OS upgrade done that Sarah requested before schools starts. Bart cleaned up the last of CE, then came over to get stuff that needed to be moved from HI. I was working on getting the Macs at HI hooked up and reformatted as necessary. All that's left over there is the Lab and grades 1 and 3. Craig was working TS and took a machine over to NV for me....seems that we are doing OK hitting the high spots, so far. I will be up half the night finishing up the email stuff for the subs....not enough hours during the day and it needs to be done before Thurs, cuz they need to get their info for the treasurers office.  Marching Band is going great for NV....the drum line is kicking major butt and they and the drum majors could be the thing that puts Band over the top as the best thing about football. Gene B is doing cool new stuff for halftime and the drum line got extra rehearsal before regular band camp; which really seemed to get them pumped up for the season. personally, can't wait till next week to see them on the field again....I know it will be awesome!!!  Be back later.....bye!
