      Gemma: Welcome to the world of blogging! hehe I think I'll call you tomorrow. Late na cguro subong and you're probably not in church naman. Hmm... I'm wondering what it's all about? And, I already invited Gigi, but she hasn't replied to the invitation yet. So how was the serminar with Dr. Harold Sala? Ok man? Cos I didn't go kay daw ka themed gid sa family eh. hehehe And I can't picture myself attending that kind of conference. Don't get me wrong, I love my family, pero you know ... basta, di ko guro ma marriage counselor mo ... but then again, we'll never know ... basi  Boksuniu  pa noh? hahahaha *KIDDING*  Man,  urlLink web1000  has been down for quite some time now ... Bon & Mel, at least you still have Random Ramblings to post your diasppointments, yeah? LOL :)  Mel, your  Achi  Melanie (accent ni Melanie Steenkamp! LOL) wasn't online either? _THAT_ is WEIRD! Hmm... I don't know ... maybe stalker mo ... who used your Y! ID :) hehehe   Random Thought: In some Arab countries you need a passport, and a "reason" to acccess Internet ... (quoting aFreLance from #php Undernet)   Anyway, I still have the whole story of DEAD STARS to read tonight and I have only read the first verse. Tsk tsk tsk I'm very happy Random Ramblings is getting bigger! WHEEE!!! Is there anybody else you guys want to invite? Just tell me, ok? :)

I was late again, today, and when I arrived Keren said,  "Aga ka pa online ba!"  But then, I wasn't, so I told her that maybe it was my sister who was online. And it turns out that she wasn't. Hehe is that some kind of bug??

         Come Home!     Read: Luke 15:11-32    "Your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found." - Luke 15:32   Bible In One Year: 2 Samuel 19-21  --+-----------------------  Several years ago, my wife Carolyn and I camped near the town of Brimley, in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. It was a oliday, and we ambled into town for the annual parade. Believe me, it was something to write home about.   There were marshals on horseback, homecoming queens, forest rangers, even Smokey Bear! There was a float faturing Big Bird from Sesame Street, and a flatbed truck carrying a brass band of men and women wearing straw ats and dressed in red-white-and-blue uniforms. There were vehicles of all kinds: tractors, trailers, trucks, and kids n tricycles.   But the last float fully captured our attention. It featured a gray-haired old man kneeling at the foot of a cross. Across the back of the float was written: "COME HOME!" - JESUS   Jesus still calls, "Come home!" You're never too far away or too far gone to come back to your Father's love. He stands waiting, just as the father of the prodigal son did. "When he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion" (Luke 15:20). He rejoiced that his son was no longer lost (v.32).   Come home to God. Don't stay away. No matter what you've done, or left undone, He still loves you. - David Roper    O Lord, it's true, I've wandered far From what I know is right, But now I want to come back home And please You day and night. - K. De Haan    It's never too soon to come home to God.     Our Daily Bread -  urlLink http://www.gospelcom.net/rbc/odb/

      Hey, sorry for the looong absence. I've been busy making blinkies, and I'm trying to make one for RR. I just realized. It's so tedious. Frame by frame, pixel by pixel. I'm starting to hate it already. hehe *joke*  Apart from that, I'm filling in for my mom at our store, so I don't get that much computer time anymore. My cousin Marlowe (Neil's older brother is getting married on the 29th, so my mom went to Manila to attend the wedding. As for me, I take over her desk. *sigh* it's sooo boring and I don't even get paid for it.  Ok. I'll stop ranting. God bless you all and have a wonderful vacation (unlike me, who's stuck at the store. *kidding only* :D).  P.S. Ok, thanks Ren. I'll do that.

      It depends on who's hands it's in.   A basketball in my hands is worth about P 200.00 A basketball in Michael Jordan's hands is worth about $33 million.  It depends whose hands it's in.   A baseball in my hands is worth about $6.  A baseball in Mark McGuire's hands is worth $19 million.  It depends on whose hands it's in.   A tennis racket is useless in my hands.  A tennis racket in Venus Williams' hands is a championship winning.  It depends whose hands it's in.   A rod in my hands will keep away a wild animal.  A rod in Moses' hands will part the mighty sea.  It depends whose hands it's in.   A sling shot in my hands is a kid's toy  A sling shot in David's hand is a mighty weapon.  It depends whose hands it's in.   Two fish and 5 loaves of bread in my hands is a couple of fish sandwiches.  Two fish and 5 loaves of bread in God's hands will feed thousands.  It depends whose hands it's in.   Nails in my hands might produce a birdhouse  Nails in Jesus Christ's hands will produce salvation for the entire world.  It depends whose hands it's in.   As you see now it depends whose hands it's in.  So put your concerns, your worries, your fears, your hopes, your dreams, your families and your relationships in God's hands because...  It depends whose hands it's in.   This message is now in your hands.  What will YOU do with it?  It depends who's hands you're in.

      THE LORD'S BASEBALL GAME   Freddy and the Lord stood by to observe a baseball game. The Lord's team was playing Satan's team.  The Lord's team was at bat, the score was tied zero to zero, and it was the bottom of the 9th inning with two outs. They continued to watch as a batterstepped up to the plate whose name was Love.  Love swung at the first pitch and hit a single, because Love never fails.  The next batter was named Faith, who also got a single because Faith works with Love.  The next batter up was named Godly Wisdom.Satan wound up and threw the first pitch. Godly Wisdom looked it over and let it pass: Ball one. Three more pitches and Godly Wisdom walked, because Godly Wisdom never swings at what Satan throws.  The bases were now loaded. The Lord then turned to Freddy and told him He was now going to bring in His star player. Up to the plate stepped Grace. Freddy said, "He sure doesn't look like much!"  Satan's whole team relaxed when they saw Grace. Thinking he had won the game, Satan wound up and fired his first pitch. To the shock of everyone, Grace hit the ball harder than anyone had ever seen. But Satan was not worried; his center fielder let very few get by. He went up for the ball, but it went right through his glove, hit him on the head and sent him crashing on the ground; then it continued over the fence for a home run!  The Lord's team won!  The Lord then asked Freddy if he knew why Love, Faith, and Godly Wisdom could get on base but could not win the game. Freddy answered that he did not know why.  The Lord explained, "If your love, faith, and wisdom had won the game you would think you had done it by yourself. Love, Faith and Wisdom will get you on base but only My Grace can get you Home.  Psalm 84:11, "For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord will give grace and glory; no good thing will He withhold from those who walk uprightly."

      Dear Friend,  The Lord Jesus is great and greatly to be praised!  With so much talk of war and economic troubles, it is an easy thing to give place to fear.  After hearing the local and world news reports it is no wonder the hearts of unsaved men and women give into fear of the near future.  Dearest Saint, we want you to know that prayer and faith in the promises of God can change things!   They will hold us firm and steadfast, like an anchor for our souls, even in the midst of turbulent times. Here are some of those promises made by the Almighty     "If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways;                                    then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."    ~ 2 Chronicles 7:14- ~  "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways."   ~ Psalm 91:1-7, 10 & 11~  As we join together with Pastor Benny and Suzanne Hinn  while watching the March 3rd program praying for a visitation from Heaven, let's believe for God's mighty hand to stretch fourth and perform signs and wonders.  Stand on His promises of supernatural protection and provision for you and your loved ones.   Remember to pray for President Bush as the leader of America and the leaders of the nations of the world, as well as, praying for all the men and women in the military who are placing themselves in harms way for us all.  Last and most important, that Jesus be glorified through it all and that a great multitude of souls will be saved as a result!  Thank you for your prayers and support.  May goodness and mercy follow you all the days of your life.  In His service,    urlLink Benny Hinn Ministries

      hi ed...nice to meet you too!  yup, God is in Control, no matter what!!!! All we need to do is stuck it in our heads....CRAM IT, more likely.... hehehe...sakit galing.... anyways, been reading na magraduate ka man, Congrats!!!! miss ko man high school...especially, the worship services and the bible week....huhuhuh....  have you heard Kid's praise God's On his Throne song?  i reli reli definitely certainly love it...as in fitting for my life and yours too...hay, life is very unnerving at times gid...  ren...yup, i would reli need to try harder to read it sa summer...as you said, shelf it anay....wala pa man ko gani ka finish with Dealing with Difficult Pipol...though tolerable na...plus am juggling it with Gervis book...Woman,Thou art Loosed by TD Jakes...not to mention the book u saw me bringing to choir last friday....cant wait for skool to end...even jaz a wk without skol stuf to think about....GIRA, GIRA na!!!!  Lord, pls. do come na.....pls pray for me coz wala pa ko kastart studying....grr....  mel:  wer ka, remember the savitch java book, ha...btw, wala pa ko kastart workin on my assign    Gotta go....GOD BLESS U ALL!  Dont QUIT  When things go wrong as they sometimes will,  When the road youre trudging seems all uphill, When the funds are low and the debts are high, And you want to smile but you have to sigh, When care is pressing you down a bit, Rest if you must but dont you quit.  Life is queer with its twists and turns,  As everyone of us sometimes learns, And many a failure turns about, When he might have won had he stuck it out, Dont give up though the pace seems slow, You may succeed with another blow.  Success is failure turned inside out, The silver tint of the clouds of doubt, And you never can tell how close you are, It may be near when it seems so far, So stick in the fight when youre hardest hit, Its when things seem worse that you mustnt quit. ---Source Unknown

      JohnR: I don't want to stain your perception sa college pero I think ma-miss mo gid ang high school in one way or the other. I used to think that way too, until some things brought back memories then you can't help but say, "I miss high school!" :)  Haaayyyy ... I really do miss high school. Althougth I do love college very much especially the freedom you have. Sigh. Very nostalgic gid when I think about HS. Miss ko man mga Worship Services every week sa school, before gina take for granted ko gid na during elementary and the early years of HS, but now I realize it's significance. Grabe gid pag nurture sina sa akon nga spiritual growth. Especially if you're feeling down, then Worship Service comes, and God would just use the speaker to speak to you ... and you just go back to God. In it's little way, I could call it personal revival. :) Thank you  urlLink Trinity Christian School  for being a part of my life. Wow, I know  Hao Tiu  would be very happy to read this. And no, I don't think this is cheesy! hehe ;)  Bon: Ssuuu-weeeeet! I want LCD monitor too, haaayyy... cge lang, as what Gemma's been telling me, I should be contented with what I have, cge, 17" monitor ko, ok na ko ni! hehe ;)   Anyway, I'll be leaving in 2 years, after ko graduate college my parents said they'll buy me a nu notebook and a professional digital camera when I get to Bible school. So I can wait. hehe Despite that, ma upgrade man ko next week MOBO, processor and more memory, so... yey!!! hehe :D  Gems: Hehe Mayo man tapos na ko sa JAVA! Thank you Lord! ;) Next year naman... so, ano na to thesis ta? Remember, we have 2 years to prepare and counting ... hehehe I do pray that you'll get through with your exams, I know you can do it, I have big confidence that you can. Dba Phil. 4:13! :) And sure, I can lend you the book sa Friday, anyway, I'm not done with the other one yet plus loads more in my shelf. hehe Isa-isahon ko lang anay ... I lurrrve books! haha You know if I was younger, I would take that statement back, pero not anymore! lol You know what, if that book is SO HARD to read, hmmm.... never mind! hehe Remember hambal ni Mommy Ruth, it's life-changing! Pero it's not the Bible naman, so you can shelve that ...  hehe Study ka lang anay ... :)  Edmar: 7 days .... and ma-graduate ka na! Congratulations!!! :D  Actually, I typed this blog entry yesterday at 6:11pm pa ... the advantages of using  urlLink w.Bloggar .... maka-save ka entry without posting it yet ;)

      (here's what i posted but this ain't it all! there was more but hey! i'm tired to recall everything i said.. hehe..)  keren: about the youth clinic, it sure sounds great!! especially on our youth group who are drifting along the waves of the world!! hehe.. they sure need evangelism clinic so that they're minds would be diverted to better things.. but i have to consult that with my dad coz' our church are very particular with church doctrine.. they don't just let other people come in and teach what they believe.. but i'm not sayin that the YOUTH EE's doctrine is all wrong.. hehe.. our church is just very strict when it comes to that.. i'll just have to consult first before making a decision.. and then i'll have to inform our youth president so that he can set up a date for the youth clinic.. i'll just get back to you when they affirm the said clinic.. :)

      There's A Reason  For every pain that we must bear, for every burden, every care, There's a reason.  For every grief that bows the head, for every teardrop that is shed, there's a reason.  For every hurt, for every plight, for every lonely pain-racked night, there's a reason.  But if we trust God as we should, it all will work out for our good. He knows the reason.  "We know that for those who love God, all things work together unto Good." (romans 8:28)

       5151 HAVE SAID THIS PRAYER, INCLUDING MYSELF.. So that makes 5152.. this was sent by my cousin from Hawaii.. she's such a dear girl.. :)    Please take a moment to relax your mind and humble your heart to focus on Christ. Allow God, to be the only person on your mind while you read this prayer. If we can take the time to read long jokes, stories, etc., we should give the same respect to this prayer. Friends that pray together, stay together.  Dear Lord, I thank You for this day. I thank You for my being able to see and to hear this morning. I'm blessed because You are a forgiving God and an understanding God. You have done so much for me and You keep on blessing me.  Forgive me this day for everything I have done, said or thought that was not pleasing to you. I ask now for Your forgiveness.  Please keep me safe from all danger and harm. Help me to start this day with a new attitude and plenty of gratitude. Let me make the best of each and every day to clear my mind so that I can hear from You.  Please broaden my mind that I can accept all things.   Let me not whine and whimper over things I have no control over. Let me continue to see sin through God's eyes and acknowledge it as evil. And when I sin, let me repent, and confess with my mouth my wrongdoing, and receive the forgiveness of God.  And when this world closes in on me, let me remember Jesus' example - to slip away and find a quiet place to pray. It's the best response when I'm pushed beyond my limits. I know that when I can't pray, You listen to my heart. Continue to use me to do Your will.  Continue to bless me that I may be a blessing to others. Keep me strong that I may help the weak. Keep me uplifted that I may have words of encouragement for others. I pray for those that are lost and can't find their way. I pray for those that are misjudged and misunderstood. I pray for those who don't know You intimately. I pray for those that will delete this without sharing it with others. I pray for those that don't believe. But I thank you that I believe.  I believe that God changes people and God changes things. I pray for all my sisters and brothers. For each and every family member in their households. I pray for peace, love and joy in their homes that they are out of debt and all their needs are met.  I pray that every eye that reads this knows there is no problem, circumstance, or situation greater than God. Every battle is in Your hands for You to fight. I pray that these words be received into the hearts of every eye that sees them and every mouth that confesses them willingly.  This is my prayer. In Jesus' Name, Amen.

      this is from an email that i got from a friend..   One day Satan and Jesus were having a conversation. Satan had just come from the Garden of Eden, and he was gloating and boasting. Yes, sir, I just caught the world full of people down there. Set me a trap used bait I knew they couldn't resist. Got 'em all!"  "What are you going to do with them?" Jesus asked Satan replied, "Oh, I'm gonna have fun! I'm gonna teach them how to marry and divorce each other, how to hate and abuse each other, how to drink and smoke and curse. I'm gonna teach them how to invent guns and bombs and kill each other. I'm really gonna have fun!"  "And what will you do when you get done with them?" Jesus asked  "Oh, I'll kill 'em," Satan glared proudly.  "How much do you want for them?" Jesus asked.  "Oh, you don't want those people. They ain't no good. Why, you'll take them and they'll just hate you. They'll spit on you, curse you and kill you!! You don't want those people!!"  "How much?" He asked again.  Satan looked at Jesus and sneered, "All your tears, and all your blood."  Jesus said, "DONE!" Then He paid the price.  Isn't it funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world's going to hell.  Isn't it funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible says.  Isn't it funny how everyone wants to go to heaven provided they do not have to believe, think, say, or do anything the Bible says. Or is it scary?  Isn't it funny how someone can say "I believe in God" but still follow Satan (who, by the way, also "believes" in God).  Isn't it funny how you can send a thousand jokes through e-mail and! they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing.  Isn't it funny how the lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but the public discussion of Jesus is suppressed in the school and workplace.  Isn't it funny how someone can be so fired up for Christ on Sunday, but be an invisible Christian the rest of the week.  Are you laughing?  Isn't it funny how when you go to forward this message, you will not send it to many on your address list because you're not sure what they believe, or what they will think of you for sending it to them.  Isn't it funny how I can be more worried about what other people think of me than what God thinks of me.  Will YOU pass this on? .... I did

      Yey! Join na si Margaret aka GIGI! Sadya man gid bala! :) Musta thesis mo G? :) Yey! We are getting bigger ang bigger and bigger ... wow, ako pa gid! Hay, summer naman, wala opisyo luto naman kag kaon! hahaha May utang pa ko kay Laurie luto home-made Churros dipped in melting chocolate! Sigh.   Bon, sadya gle sa Main Strip Alley noh? Actually, iya na sang ... ano mo gani Mel? :) and Neil pa gid? :) Baw, suki pa gid ya? hehe Ako nag lang ko sa RC (Royal Carribean) sang patties...Jerky! hehe Matyag ko gin kaon ko nga snacks gapon mas mahal pa sa lunch kow! hehe And yes, thanks for that reminder Bon! Ara pa na ang poster diri sa kwarto hehe ... I can pass Calculus, gin calculate ko na actually ang grades ko sa Prelim & Midterm. Galing kay ano ma ubra ko, phobia gid ko sa numbers ya. P6 naman next year, mayo lang wala na Chem. hehe   Hay, the frustrations I release here, matyag ko sometimes gina underestimate ko na lang si God sa ma-ubra nya through me. :( Sorry Lord. :(  Oh yes, I was sharing this since yesterday, I was asked by urlLink  Boogs Software  to "join their team" cos may job opening daw sa web designing team nila. I'm not sure if the guy was serious pero I really think he was. And then he was quite shocked when he realized that I was still in college because I told him jokingly, if he is willing to pay my tuition in Manila then I would gladly join the team.  If I was in Manila right now, I wouldn't hesitate to grab that offer! I guess that's just one of the reasons why I'm placed here in Bacolod. Most probably if I was in Manila right now, I wouldn't be as active in church activities.  I used to have the dream of going far with what I love to do, and somehow, that lure to go back to that dream is just too inviting! We can't serve two masters at the same time, but as much as I want to go into web developing, I choose to serve God above all. Please pray that I won't be fickle and that God would give me strength to stand on the commitment I made to him. :)

       THE VALLEY SONG (SING OF YOUR MERCY)  by  urlLink JARS OF CLAY , taken from FURTHERMORE, their new album -- great compilation from one of my fave bands! :)      You have led me to the sadness i have carried this pain on a back bruised, nearly broken i'm crying out to You  i will sing of Your mercy that leads me through valleys of sorrow to rivers of joy  when death, like a gypsy comes to steal what i love i will still look to the heavens i will still seek your face but i fear You aren't listening because there are no words just the stillness and the hunger for a faith that assures  CHORUS alleluia, alleluia  while we wait for rescue with our eyes tightly shut face to the ground using our hands to cover the fatal cut though the pain is an ocean tossing us around, around, around You have calmed greater waters higher mountains have come down    ********************************************  I like it so much because of the message...   In the midst of our pain, we are encouraged to remember Him. When we are bruised and broken, we are called to remember His sufferings. Jesus carried His cross on a bruised and bloody back and walked directly into crucifixion for something He did not do. He was killed by people He loved and cared for, abandoned by all. But He walked that valley. He carried that cross. He completed His assignment. He purchased our salvation.   When you think you can't make it through the valley, when the pain gets too great to bear, when you can't take another step--remember the cross. Draw strength from the cross, fall on your face at the foot of the cross and let the One who bore it all help you bear it now.   -- Reflection on  urlLink The Valley Song    Source :  urlLink SolidSounds.org , featuring insights from Gods Word on the lyrics of todays Christian music  ********************************************  Gems, does that describe  our  situation or what? Or mine lang? Hmmm ... hehehe :D

      hi ren:) hehehehe...kaw research a....sagad kaman with all the tech in thy grasp...:P....btw, pls invite mishy ha to join the blog para masadyahan man cya...galing nagchange email add nya...pls. ask her....:) i discussed some about this to her....tanx....gudnyte....excited na ko to see you on friday....damo ko ishare with you....hehehe....  hi neil, happi ko ur at long last able to get in na...how are you na?  miss you...hehehe...  ARTICLE FOR THE DAY.....   Could you use a word of encouragement?  When my niece, Katie, was a baby and would begin to cry uncontrollably, her father, Rush, would burst out in song with the first words of a hymn, "Troublesome times are here..." I think he was on to something.  Sometimes we all need a word of encouragement. Troublesome times are here, and not just when the baby is crying. We face all kinds of trouble. There are ordinary troubles: nagging illnesses make us feel not quite ourselves; our jobs become boring and repetitive; we worry about our children; we don't feel appreciated.  Then there are real troubles, serious ones: the tumor is malignant; the company is downsizing and you lose your job; your single daughter is expecting; your parents have to move in with you; your faith is challenged and you begin to wonder if you've lost it altogether.  Then there are the troublesome times in which we live, times we cannot control. Like many of my generation who were raised in small towns and suburbs, I grew up in Mayberry, or rather, in Beaver Cleaver's neighborhood. I played outside with all the neighborhood kids and even went to their houses without my parents being alarmed. After all, everyone in our neighborhood was a Christian of some sort (well, except for the Jewish family around the corner and the one family down the street who didn't go to church anywhere). Even if they weren't devout Christians, they were good people, decent people. You could trust your kids would be O.K. at their houses.  Times have changed. We hear so much today about violence and abuse that we want to know a great deal about a family before we let our kids play with them. We don't let them play in the neighborhood after dark. We don't even walk in the neighborhood after dark. Our culture, our nation, seems to have changed for the worse, and no matter what politicians promise, they cannot deliver. Things don't get better.  How do we live as Christians in times like these? How do we live bold, confident lives in an age that is increasingly neutral or even hostile to Christian faith? How do we keep our faith and keep our children faithful in the face of the greed and violence of a culture rushing madly after pleasure?  What we need is a word of encouragement.  reference:  www.heartlight.org...   mel, wer r u?

      Yeah, budlay gd kun mapa-"EK" pa sila. I told them about it man gani sang naga plano pa lang. Budlay gd na ya.    Not-So-Detailed Schedule:  May 9 - Arrival in UECP from Caliraya, around 1-2pm, or maybe before lunch May 10 - LAGAW DAY May 11 - LAGAW DAY still  May 12 - Leave for Bacolod, 11am I think  I'm not so sure about that though, I'm not the one holding the tickets anymore, I already passed them to Laurie. Yes, we will be extra careful gid. I'm packed ready with all the Vitamin Cs I can carry! hehe :D  Full-time or Part-time: Which Art Thou?   Pasalubong? Ok, let's see, that's Napoleones for Kuya Donj (naks! haha), err... Neil, ano gusto mo?

      Hey ker (and all you other guys out there),  Well, the transpo can be quite a problem although the EK (Enchanted Kingdom) thing i think daw gina planuhan naman nila ni atsi len and ptr. johnny. We talked about it last sunday since they told me nga nag-offer man gani sila nga lagawon kamo. On my part, can you guys at least give me a detailed sched coz like I said medyo busy ako. Indi lang because of the studies, involved man ako for the Orientation Seminar of the incoming freshies so we're quite busy right now getting sponsorships, preparing stuff etc. and i'm also involved with the DORM Orientation Seminar so medyo damo damo mga meetings ko subong and stuff like that. But sige lang a, pray that God will give me a day nga la gid ko ubrahon para malagaw ta. Bantay kamo gali ha, hambal nila kuno may sars na di e. Warnings have been placed all over ADMU about it. Ka tsim tsiok tse. =)  What do you me? How was I sure bout my calling or am i sure kung ma-fulltime ko or part-time. Well i guess i'll answer both nalang. For one thing, sure naman ko nga mafulltime ko. I'm not saying your not just because your going to BSOP. Actually ren, advantage na gani para sa imo kay you can help later generations of youth who think they feel the call of God for full time. =) Mine is actually quite simple. God called me at a quite early age. I'm not so sure bout the age anymore but im sure it was before I was 10. THere was just an overwhelming desire in me to tell people about God. And since bata pa ko at that time, I just accepted it. Being a child, the thoughts of money, career, etc. never crossed my mind pa. =) Now that i'm in college, they do come up from time to time but i just continue to believe that God will provide. =)  He has been for the last 17 years of my life and i really don't think He plans to stop providing any time soon. =)  Bout your standing up sa the edge, yups, i remember it. And you know why I smiled? Because for years, I have been asking God for more people. Not just in the congregation but for more fulltimers. And hey so far, the camps weve been having are raising up more and more full timers. Hehe. =) I guess you could say that even without your knowledge, i was indirectly praying for you, isis, gigi and the others who stood up sa recent camps naton.  Well, daw laba naman ni gani ang akon nga na sulat. Just text me or give a kol when your here na a. I'll be waiting. Dont forget PASALUBONG!!!!! Hehehehehehehe. Bacolod's famous chicken. =) Take Care. GOD BLESS. =)

      Koolitz aka Donj: Please introduce yourself. Poi pa gid! hehe :) Now I have combat attack for SARS! hehe  Edmar: Gani man, you're gonna learn how to sing when you're doing it for God. :) You should hear Gemma's singing  career  story... hehe ... kun pano sha ka-reach sang high-flying falsettos nya ala Charlotte Church! haha (Pati Gem, galing kay tuod man gid, CC always come to mind when I hear you! :)) Oh, you had piano lessons gle? Cool! :) Ako man gani before, pero feeling ko di man ko gifted sa music! hehe Congratulations again sa imo and sa shoti mo yesterday sa baptismal nyo! I'm very happy for the both of you gid. :) I forgot to ask you, when's the exact date of your treatment gale? Naka-schedule na? :) And Neil's right, that could really give you time for reflection. God bless gid. :)  Neil: Techie? Define "techie" please. hehe I'm not either, long way to go pa ko da ya! hehe Mauna na ko da ya lakat sa 3, sila pa sa 5th! hehe Kun tani may pa-istar ka sila Neil dugay na kami ara da! hehe Oh yeah, grabe gle busy sa school ka noh? Pero I know you can do it Neil! Kaw pa, I've always believed in you. (Wow! Compliment #1, lista sa notepad! haha *joke*) Cge lang pag kayod sa Phil. Lit., that's one of my fave subjects here galing kay inyo ya in Filipino gid. hehe  Ahh, we can't promise you anything Neil. Pero I know God is working gid sa youth ta subong! I can see changes, miski jutay lang. :)   Hmm.. not necessarily sa blog, but writing in general. Ok, how was I sure nga ma full-time ko? I asked God for a confirmation. Many weeks before sa THE EDGE nga camp, I was really praying hard about it that I coud hear God speak to me. Perhaps you could recall, if you were watching closely sa amon ni Isis and Gigi, and not to forget, Gemma, sa likod pag consecration night... Pagtawag sang Lifetime Dedication, I didn't have any drive to move forward. Isis started to cry when I told her, "Full-time na gid ni ya... " I actually joined her pero I came back to my senses and realized I shouldn't be swept away with my emotions (I actually laughed nga amo to gin ubra ko kay nadala ko sa iya hibi`... haha) so I stood  straight in front of Ptr. Dave sa likod nayon, when he was calling na for Full-time dedication.   I could remember that I asked to hear "GO" ... because a few weeks prior to that sa discipleship namon  nga prayer, ang verse nga " Go  and make discipleships of all nations ... " (Matt 28:19) came to mind. So during that time sa dedication, I was struggling to go forward and backward again, as though ... ambot, indescribable! hehe Basta, I knew at that moment I was called gid, I heard "Go, go, go, go ... " in my head. And when I went to the front, I felt peace, peace that passes all understanding, it's like, you just know when you know. hehe  Remember ko gd ara ka to sa una naga-smile-smile while playing the guitar! haha  And yes, I had doubts before that, that's why I asked for confirmation. And also days after that, those questions bala, "Basi ako lang to ya ..." Galing kay we know how the devil likes to feed us with lies. And when we know the truth, it sets us free! :) Now, I'm excited about sa BSOP na conference because I know I will be learning a lot gid didto and once again clarify kun Full-time or Part-time: Which Are Thou? hehe Pray for me pls. Hmm.. how about you Neil? :)  Also don't worry about it, na realize ko nga amo ka gd na ya gale, most endearing trait (hehe) and I learned to accept it. :) Apology accepted, and I'm also sorry for ignoring you sometimes cos d ko pa na chindihan before eh. Although sometimes you can be REALLY IRRITATING! haha I'm looking forward to have lagaws with you guys too! hehe Gusto actually nila Rosan & Co. kadto sa Enchanted, ambot lang kun may time pa na  ... basta lagaw mo gd kami Neil ha! :) Problema lang nila is pano transpo pakadto sa Pasay (building ni  Achi  B) from UECP, then mag go home na, Pasay to Pier -- dilemma! Sigh. That is kun ma stay sila kay  Achi  B, pero may gin offer man to kanday  Khuey Amah Hong Giap So  na bata, sa may Greenhills daw, pero d pa sure cos 4 lang maka-sleep sa bed and others will be in the sala na daw. hehe 7 sila tanan mag-stay for lagaw, +1 = 8 (that's me! hehe)   Wow, grabe, SUPER LABA na gid ni ya. Sorry fellow Ramdom Ramblers, I'm sort of making this my own blog na! hehe God bless your week y'all! :D

      Grabe ba, namis gid ko sang tanan nga mga tawo. I'm so very touched. Hehe. =) Kailinit a, wala pa ko gyapon net. I had to borrow from a dormate nga na connect na ya sang isp namon diri sa dorm. O well, i'm not that much of a "techy" pa naman a. Diba ren? Hehe. Dasiga na di bala lakat para kagwa ta di. Daw feeling ko indi nagid ninyo ko love. Naks. Hehe. =) O well, i'm dying here because of schoolwork. I can't believe how fast summer goes. @ chapters on sociology in a matter of days and a really long test this friday na. Not to mention studying -pa for my "Literature of the Phils." subject. Man, all the more i'm hating filipino. =)   To the bacolod people, musta na da kamo. Hows BTCC doing. You'd better promise me sa pagbalik ko mas nag-improve nagid ta. Or else mahibi gid ko. Kumusta na da ang mga leaders. Ren, since hambal mo sakon mas free ka magtok over blog then answer me some of these ?'s. How were you able to be sure nga mafull-time ka? Was there ever a time nga nagdoubt ka about going full time? (Btw, in case your wondering, no i'm not doubting but please answer the ?'s lang, thanks gid.) Kumusta na da gli knday gemz, gigi, isis, laurz, ,elissa, michy and the other women? How bout the guys? Pray gid da kamo for andrew ha. I can tell you nga budlay gid life diri ya. He needs all the covering he can get. I need as much covering as i can get.  Guys, congatulate edmar and his little bro raymund. They got baptized kagina sa prince david (Condo where ptr. johnny and atsi len lives in). Ed, happy gid ko nga kamo ni shote mo nagdecide nga mapabaptize. And I am really looking forward to work together with you in the immediate future. :p And i'm also looking forward to the many lagaws that we will be having together. Btw, God bless gali para sa treatment mo this coming week. Hope everything turns out fine. Maybe you can spend the time meditating on some issues, huh? =)  Well, i guess i'll have to end here for now. Dunno when I can be online again. I hope the dorm isp can get be connected asap (NO!!!!! I AM NOT A TECHY!!! Hehe) And ker, kung abi mo ang mga suya ko is just my way of harassing you, well ma-apologize na lang gid ko daan kay amo lang gid ko na ya. Sunluganon loang gid ko nga tawo. Ask everybody. God bless all of you guys. To the FCCF delagates, hope that I'll be able to meet with you guys while you are here.

      WELCOME GUYZ! Thanks for JOINING here! heheh daw piho man?!!  Newayz...share ko lang ni hu ah.. ---- Hi there, this is a FYI only. This is a forward message:  Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,  My sister in Hong Kong told me there's a recipe for the prevention and treatment of SARS, given by some alleged Divine Source in 1986 and published in a book at that time. I am not going to comment on that source here, but I  do want to share this recipe with you:  Garlic       1 clove Ginger       a few slices Lemon juice  1 table spoon Honey        1 tea spoon  Mince and press the garlic and ginger in a cup, add the lemon juice and honey, then add boiling  hot water to it, mix and brew for a while. Drink and eat the entire content.  Since the ingredients garlic, ginger, lemon, honey and water are all good for health, I feel confident enough to pass this information to you.  The story went that a certain doctor in Hong Kong contracted a severe flu in Jan. this year. At that time nobody even knew about SARS, but she was so severely ill that she thought she was going to die in spite of all the antiviral agents and antibiotics she was taking. Then she remembered the book that she read about the alleged prophecy and alleged remedy, she tried this brew. Miraculously, she recovered almost immediately. However, she has passed the disease to her daughter, so she gave the same remedy to her daughter and she too recovered quickly. Meanwhile, her nurse contracted the sickness too, so she gave that to the nurse and she immediately recovered without the use of any other medication.  I leave it to the reader to discern what this means, to believe or not to believe. You are free to pass on this information, in fact, a friend even suggested that I should e-mail this to WHO, but I don't know their e-mail address, you, however, can do that if you like. Or, if you don't believe it, simply delete it.  As for me, I place myself completely in God's hands. If it is God's will for me to contract SARS and die, I seek not to escape from it. But then, perhaps it is God's will that I should take something whose smell and taste I have dreaded all my life as an act of penance, afterall, we are still in the lenten period...just two more weeks to go. Then again, maybe it is God's will that I should eat the dreaded garlic and still die of SARS, so be it.  Until you hear from the news that all the people in Hong Kong are suddenly cured of SARS and the supermarkets all ran out of garlic and ginger, it is difficult to be certain.  Meanwhile, be happy, stay healthy and smell garlicky.  Kathy Wu IT Support Homes for the Aged Div. (416) 392-2944 kwu@toronto.ca

They held this truth so dear that they were willing to suffer torture and death rather than renounce it.   This startling message so electrified their ministry that their testimony "turned the world upside down" (Acts 17:6). It is still true today: The Holy Spirit honors the witness of those who proclaim the resurrected Jesus. They do not point primarily to moral codes, religious rituals, or theological creeds (good as these may be in themselves), but to the living God-man who alone can save. It is to Him who is "alive forevermore" (Revelation 1:18) that we should look in these days of dead orthodoxy and spiritual apostasy.   A proud and ungodly professor said to a young child who believed in the Lord Jesus, "My dear little girl, you don't know whom you believe in. There have been many christs. In which of them do you believe?" "I know which one I believe in," replied the child. "I believe in the Christ who rose from the dead!"   Jesus is alive (Luke 24:1-12). Your eternal life depends on it. - Henry Bosch   Although our Lord was crucified, He rose up from the grave; He paid our penalty for sin, Then showed His power to save. - Sper

      why people dont pray: a. ignorance: dont know how to pray b. overconfidence: that we could do everything on our own c. unbelief: we dont believe that God answers prayer d. lazy: prayer is labor e. feeling of independence  The power of prayer that's the theme for this year QCEC summer conference and indeed God was in our mindst... for 3 days we had a great time learning new things and meeting new people, meeting new friends. :O) this is my first time to attend such a conference and i was really fun.:O) hay... bitin nga lang... sana mahaba haba... hehe:O)

       I DREAMT I STOOD AT CALVARY   I dreamt I stood at Calvary  And saw three crosses there;  On left and right were nailed two thieves,  The cross between was bare.  A soldier took his sword in hand,  Then pointed it at me:  He said "You there, prepare to die.  That cross is meant for thee."  I quickly fell upon my knees,  For mercy did I cry;  As strong hands grabbed my hands and feet,  I shouted "Why, oh why?"  And then a voice both soft and sweet  Was heard above the din;  "Let this one go, take me instead.  I'll pay his price for sin."   With his body torn and bleeding  And thornmarks round his head;  With bruises where they beat him,  He stepped into my stead.  Then Jesus laid upon the cross,  His life did freely give,  That all my sins be washed away  And through his death, I'd live.  He stretched his arms out open wide,  No struggle did he make.  As they prepared to nail him there  His life they meant to take.  They drove the spikes in hands and feet,  And slammed the cross in place.  His bones were shaken out of joint,  And blood ran down his face.  "Forgive them, Father," was his cry,  They know not what they do  God must have wept when he realized  He sacrificed his only Son for you.   When I awoke, the night had passed  And Sunshine flooded in;  I cried "Dear Lord, forgive me please,  And cleanse me of my sin.  For you sent down your only son,  A ransom for the lost:  And I see you included me,  When counting out the cost.  Yes I dreamt I stood at Calvary  And saw those crosses three;  Yet no longer do I need to fear  Knowing Jesus died for me.

      yes, watched the movie... hmmm... hard to discuss everything kay wala para sequel sa reloaded but as for the matrix reloaded, it makes you think, "what if" what if our life is really not the reality? some people say its anti-christ movie, some you could get the message of the gospel in the movie, well its a little of both....  its a matter how you see things... its so mixed up you dont kow what to believe so many perspective.... like if neo is in the matrix, he is the one, but in the end, his not. but ouside the matrix, they still have a chnace of defeating the machines... hmm... i dont know if i even make sense anymore

      The Hammer, the File and the Furnace  It was the enraptured Rutherford who said in the midst of very painful trials and heartaches:  Praise God for the hammer, the file, and the furnace.  Lets think about that.  The hammer is a useful and handy instrument.  It is essential and helpful tool, if nails are ever to be driven into place.  Each blow forces them to bite deeper as the hammers head pounds and pounds.  But if the nails had feelings and intelligence, it would give us another side of the story.  To the nail, the hammer is a brutal, relentless master---an enemy who loves to beat it into submission.  That is the nails view of the hammer.  It is correct.  Except for one thing.  The nail tends to forget that both it and the hammer are held by the same workman.  The workman decides whose head will be pounded out of sightand which hammer will be used to do the job.  This decision is the sovereign right of the carpenter.  Let the nail but remember that it and the hammer are held by the same workmanand its resentment will fade as it yields to the carpenter without complaint.  The same analogy holds true for the metal that endures the rasp of the file and the blast of the furnace.  If the metal forgets that it and the tools are the objects of the same craftsmans care, it will build up hatred and resentment.  The metal must keep in mind that the craftsman knows what hes doingand is doing what is best.  Heartaches and disappointments are like the hammer, the file and the furnace.  They come in all shapes and sizes:  an unfulfilled romance, a lingering illness and untimely death, an unachieved goal in life, a broken home or marriage, a severed friendship, a wayward and rebellious child, a personal medical report that advises immediate surgery, a failing grade at school, a depression that simply wont go away, a habit you cant seem to break.  Sometimes heartaches come suddenlyother times they appear over the passing of many months, slowly as the erosion of the earth.  Do I write to a nail that has began to resent the blows of the hammer?  Are you at the brink of despair, thinking that you cannot bear another day of heartache?  Is that whats gotten you down?  As difficult as it may be for you to believe this today, the Master knows what Hes doing.  Your Savior knows your breaking point.  The bruising and crushing and melting process is designed to reshape you, not ruin you.  Your value is increasing the longer He lingers over you.  A. W. Tozer agrees:  It is doubtful whether God can bless a man greatly until He has hurt him deeply.  Aching friend---stand fast.  Like David when calamity caved in, strengthen yourself in the Lord your God (1 Sam. 30:6).  Gods hand is in your heartache.  Yes, it is!  If you werent important, do you think He would take this long and work this hard on your life?  Those whom God uses most effectively have been hammered, filed and tempered in the furnace of trials and heartaches.

      Sorry I've been away from RR. Sorry Gems. Kamusta ka na? Ok ka na? Edmar, kaw man? Musta na?  Mel & Neil, balik na blog. Donj! How is work? Bon, wru? Poi, busy gd permi?  To the rest, I hope everything is going well with you.    I WAS NOT CALLED   "I cannot go," I hear you say, "It's not my work; I was not called. Too bad so many die that way,  Without a hope, without a God, But here at home I have to stay." But then I hear my Savior say, "It was my work to die for you. In Heav'n I did not please to stay. I came to earth not for a few, But all should know I am the Way." "I cannot go," I hear you say, "My child is small  And he needs all the world can give him today. It would not do to be so cruel To one who cannot choose his way." And then I hear my Father say, "I gave My Son, My only One, to give the world the only Way. He suffered alll upon the cross. Can you do less for Me today?" "I cannot go," I hear you say, "It takes so much Of strength and grace. I have no talents to display, My faith is weak; right here I'll stay. The smart and strong go far away." I hear my Lord and Master say, "Have you not read Within My Word, 'Ye are vessels made of clay?' I choose the weak to give My strength. Let all who will serve Me today."

      A Poem by Russell Kelfer  You are who you are for a reason. you're part of an intricate plan. you're a precious and perfect unique design, called God's special woman or man.  You look like you look for a reason. our God made no mistake. He knit you together within the womb, you're just what he wanted to make.  The parents you had were the ones he chose, and no matter how you may feel, They custom-designed with God's plan in mind, and they bear the master's seal  No, the trauma you faced was not easy. and God wept that it hurt you so; But it was allowed to shape your heart So that into his likeness you'd grow.  you are who you are for a reason, you've been formed by the master's rod you are who you are, beloved, because there is a GOD!

      Artist: GARTH BROOKS  Album: Double Live  Title: Unanswered Prayers     Just the other night A hometown football game My wife nd I ran into My old high school flame And as I introduced them The past came back to me And I couldn't help but Think of the way Things used to be She was the one that I'd wanted for all times And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine And if he'd only grant me This wish I wished back then I'd never ask for anything again  Sometimes I thank God For unanswered prayers Remember when you're Talkin' to the man upstairs That just because He doesn't answer Doesn't mean He don't care Some of God's greatest gifts Are unanswered prayers  She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams  And I could tell that Time had changed me Inn her eyes too it seemed We tried to talk About the old days There wasn't much We could recall I guess the Lord knows What he's doin' after all  And as she walked away And I looked at my wife And then and there I thanked the good Lord For the gifts in my life  Sometimes I thank God For unanswered prayers Remember when you're Talkin' to the man upstairs That just because He may not answer Doesn't mean He don't care Some of God's greatest gifts Are unanswered prayers  Some of God's greatest gifts Are all too often unanswered Some of God's greatest gifts Are unanswered prayers

      You guys can check out  urlLink www.namfrel.org  for the latest National Quick Count.. as of now, GMA leads FPJ by almost 1.2 Million votes.. And Noli De Castro leading by 1.1 Million votes over to Loren Legarda..  We've been talking about the Presidential Candidates here that we forgot about the Vice-President.. Whom did you vote for Vice-President? I voted  urlLink Herminio Aquino ..  To know a little more about the candidates (although it's too late! hehe),  urlLink CLICK HERE .. Check out  urlLink FPJ , coz' his profile was all about showbiz and none about politics..  Whoever wins, let's just pray about it! :) Success and Development doesn't only depend on our leaders but also on the people under them.. Let's just pray for Cooperation and Unity across the nation.. :)

      Well, it looks like most of us voted, to say the least, rooted for, Bro. Eddie.   After the elections, when the battle's between the three heads: GMA, FPJ and if Ping would have caught up with them. I'd go for Ping na lang! (I have my own convictions)  Local elections: Bing was declared a winner locally, but not yet nationally. Some people are speculating and I hear rumors about pressing charges? What?  Template stuff: I changed it, again! haha No, it's not random. Just love to experiment that's all. Question again,  what is your favorite Blogger template  as of this moment?  And oh my, I've seen Eddie Gil over Wazzup-Wazzup (sp?) and in local shows. As one survey goes, Do you think Eddie Gil should go for showbiz instead?  Therefore, my conclusion is, PRAY FOR THE PHILIPPINES. (Huh? Connection?)   Welcome to the new RR-ers, by the way! :) Rock on! hehe

      gina pa ko ga comment comment di ko tani magpost pero daw ka damo na comment ko eh wahehhe   well in response to keren.. I go for bro. eddie pero wala ko ka vote kay wala ko d ka pa reg sa manila hehe c MM nalang nag vote for me.. like i said ang strategy nila nga "Vote GMA or FPJ will win" effective gd katama.. publish a survey that FPJ is leading..dollar rate is rising..blah blah..well cno man nga tawo indi kulbaan? so ang tawo ma vote nalang sang tawo nga ga second kay FPJ sa survey.. they voted for GMA not because she is the right leader but of fear that FPJ will win.. no offense ha.. basta that's reality.. ;) but i guess all we have to do now is to pray to GOD for our country.  enough said...

      Keren: meeeee too! I'm a sucker for foreign accents.. my favorite is british!! hehe. it's remarkably head-spinning! it's like a drug.. but i don't do drugs!! haha.. and i'm speakin' while i'm writing this! haha.. u can just go right ahead and imagine me doing it.. :) i'm insane! i know.. i've said that several times already in my whole life.. (still speaking in a british accent.. haha!)  who did i vote? well, it's supposed to be a secret but it doesn't matter now.. this would be a shock to some of you guys, but i didn't vote Eddie Villanueva.. If Eddie Gil was still on the list, I would vote him!! NOT!!! haha.. We have a reason why we didn't vote him and I don't want to stress it out.. :) we all can vote whoever we want and that's totally okay.. it's a freedom! (",) But if you insist on asking my reasons of not voting Mr Villanueva, well then I think I would tell you about it, i think? hehe.. anyway, i voted GMA! why so? let's say i voted for Ping Lacson.. would that do me any good? I don't think so, coz' as you can see, he's soooooooooo far away from winning.. and if i voted him, gma would lose 1 vote and that's a plus 1 for FPJ.. and the outcome? it could be a disaster! hehe.. what if my vote was the last one that could keep FPJ from winning? now that's not a pretty sight! you get my point right? I would help out GMA just to keep FPJ from winning.. but that's not all the reason why I voted her, of course! hehe.. we can't hide the fact that she's intelligent, right? she went to hardvard with clinton for crying out loud! hehe.. some may say that she's corrupt, but who isn't? if some may say that they aren't and will not compromise, hmmmm.. i think that's totally impossible! coz' some already did some compromising, as seen on tv.. don't ask me about it okay? hehe.. if you know what i'm talkin' about, then keep it to yourself so that we can avoid arguements.. :) hehe.. about choosing a candidate that i think would win, well that wasn't on my mind at all.. my head was all focused on qualification and experience..  enough about credentials and stuff about qualification or calling or whatever! the voting had already been done for.. let's just support whoever sits on which seat.. :) we won't achieve any economic development if we don't unite and cooperate.. (",) let's just pray for a peaceful election culmination..  viva EDDIE GIL!!!! haha.. (",) I'm a retard!!!

      Aloha! Wahoo OK na PC ko! ^_^  I voted for Bro. Eddie.  You guys should have voted for someone na you think deserves to be voted, not for someone who you're thinking would win, on which your vote would have mattered.  As my dad said, wasted vote na sya if you voted for someone who's expected to win.  Pero if you voted for someone na gusto mo gid, despite the fact na he or she's not winning, indi na wasted vote because you know na that person deserved your vote gid.  Goshness, seriousness! Haha! Argh, politics shmolitics! Kagamo gid sang Philippines.  Let's leave it na lang kay Lord.  But asked whom I'm rooting for by this time, it's GMA.  Anyway, ano man, naka random ni sya ang templates?  Coz the last time I visited, it was green, now it's blue/bluegreen.  Hehe.

      Pres GMA is leading about a million now as of this hour, with about 22% of the precints are counted. I hope she wins, even of the corruption and all that rather than having an actor president for 6 years..can you imagine that? haha! labay2 lg ko hi..thnxs for invite..  Did Bing won?

      Hindi na guid ako updated sa politics sa Pilipinas.  I would've voted for Roco, pero I heard he did something daw to ruin his reputation.  Ay ahay, it seems like that Edsa dos was long forgotten na.  Waay na gid ya gakadudla ang iban nga mga botante sa nagkalatabo sng una?  Arghh... It's too depressing that I force myself to believe that I don't care anymore what happens sa politics dira.  But the truth is, I still can't stop hoping for some miracle to happen.    Ker, mga maayo nga kandidato, aton nga kandidato, usually don't win.... sad noh?

      nakapost na ko before ko na basahan ang latest blog ni K...Ü as for me, i voted for GMA.  Mas ok tani kng si Brother Eddie, pero i considered the probabilities man bala kng sin-o gd ang laban² na madaog...Ü if I voted for Brother Eddie, and GMA and FPJ both have the same number of votes (it would be impossible to happen pero what if lang yah bala aw...), kanugon sng vote ko eh... tani nagdaog pa si GMA... after the election, i haven't slept gd gani.  Pati ako nagpulaw sa net while waiting for the results sa  urlLink abs-cbn  .  I'm very worried gid about the election result.  I really don't want FPJ to win.  What will happen to my future if he becomes the president of the Philippines? Tsk tsk tsk... God have mercy on me! I'm graduating next year and I don't want to be on the list of unemployed fresh graduates...

      Bon, I'm a sucker for most accents especially Singaporean (I'm weird) and British. And I can do both! haha :)  I also have two projects pending. hehe I promised a friend months ago and until now wala pa gyapon until he stopped reminding me. Ka bad gid ah! hehe  President? Who did you guys vote for? I voted for  urlLink Bro. Eddie  pero he's not going anywhere at this rate. :(  urlLink GMA  &  urlLink FPJ ? Although I do not greatly support the Arroyo administration, I'd rather root for her rather than leave the Philippines in the hands of FPJ. Kulbaan lang gid ko ya just thinking about it. Hayyy...  I voted for Joy Valdez, but then it seems like Bing is going to win. Ambot ah, basta mga candidato ko ya wala gid gadala-ug ah! hehe Si Novero lang gid guro. Haaayyyy... ok lang.   Do you guys still watch  urlLink AMERICAN IDOL ? (If you're watching sa STAR, read no further, SPOILERS ahead).   I can't believe La Toya's been voted out? Yikes. Nami gid to sha ya voice, seriously. Who do you think will win?

      Is it just me? Or do all my  urlLink blogspot  accounts bear no ads, including this one? Am I just plain lucky or what?

      ei! random ramblings is back! aww..... thats great.. :)  Just a thought: um.. do you know that a virgin could get pregnant? and have a baby? um... artificially that is, get an egg from a girl, then sperm from a guy and walah! a baby... from a virgin... hmm...people believe this, because it is possible due to science, but why is it so hard for some to believe that Jesus was born from a virgin? if man can do i now, certainly God could do it right? man call it science, but isnt it a miracle?
