       Brian and Millie left for Los Angeles yesterday. Unfortunately, for some reason I don't have any good pictures of Millie (Brian/Millie, this is a hint to e-mail me some)

      I spent 4 am Thursday to about 3 pm Friday out at a well. Despite the crappy hours, this was actually a pretty good trip. The roughnecks on this particular drill rig have adopted a dog that apparently was tossed out of a car by someone. He just hangs around the doghouse (no pun intended, that's the covered area nest to the drilling floor where the workers hang out in during their shift).  "What's your dog's name?" "R.D." "What's R.D. stand for?" "Rig Dog."  It's the most well-fed dog I've ever seen. Every day he gets a constant offering of vienna sausages, chili, pringles potato chips, and other assorted rig food. I've never seen a dog turn down food before.       Yeah, so he's damned cute too. In general, dogs live the enlightened life of " urlLink When hungry, eat. When tired, sleep ." The rig thunders away 24 hours a day. There are 60 foot long strings of drill pipe rattling around, diesel generators growling, men yelling. Everything is covered with mud, pipe dope, grease. There's always a very small, but real, danger of accidents: a sprained back, a sudden blowout, an explosion - even a wrench dropped from the top of the derrick will inbed itself a couple of inches into a steel sheet and cleave right through a hard hat. There is night and day, but the activity never slows or stops.  And through it all, he sleeps.   Perhaps he's dreaming of  urlLink butterflies , but I think steaks and chasing rabbits are more likely.

      One of the more interesting parts of my job is that I get/have to spend a signifigant part of time out at natural gas rigs in East Texas.  I have next to no warning when this happens.  One morning, I'm in a sterile, air-conditioned office downtown.  Four hours later, I'm wearing mud-encrusted steeltoe boots and a hard hat.  I think the best part is the people you meet out there.  Even though they're in BFE, Texas now, these guys have been all over the world.  Thailand, Korea, Argentina, Indonesia, Vietnam, Saudi, you name it.  And they have been whoring everywhere.    Here's a brief selection of prostitution stories from around the world from my co-workers:  "A caddy is only 5 bucks in Thailand, so we'd get two.  One for the clubs, and one for the beer.  One of the benefits is that you can bang your caddie after every third green."  "One of the best things you can get there is a massage.  You walk in with *two* girls and a bucket of warm, soapy water.  One of the girls will lather you up, and then lie down on a table.  You lie down on top of her, and the other girl will then lie down on top of you, you know, like an Oreo.  Then they start wrigglin'.  I don't care what kind of stamina you *think* you have, friend, no man lasts long like that."  "You know how a massage table here has a hole for your face?  There, there's one for your face, and another for your dick."  "You ever hear of a Thailand 'ladyboy'?  Only made that mistake once."

      So I'm dragging my daily mass of junk mail out of my mailbox. My apartment complex provides a trashcan a few steps away, but it's still hard as hell to get it all out of there in one piece. The covers are specifically designed to fall or slip apart as soon as you touch them, thus revealing the beautiful slab of pizza on the inside. Same with my magazines. It's a lot like a dandelion that breaks apart in wind.  This got me to thinking - junk mail fits a niche in the business ecology. It's a business' way of spreading itself. The analogy isn't perfect of course, because junk mail only creates demand and not copies of the business. Although having a little pizza hut in my kitchen would be pretty handy once in a while. If you think about it, there are lots of parallels here.  -Like most fruits, advertisments are brightly colored to attract attention.  -Like burrs, commercial jingles stick to animals and get propagated to different locations (Mentos freshness! Mentos fresh and full of life! Duh Da Duh!)  -Like most grapefruit, junk mail tastes really bad and is not suitible for human consumption.

      "So maybe you should try Tai Chi for your back. It's supposedly really good for that." "Tai Chi?" "Yeah, it's good for balance and it's relaxing as well. I took a class in college." "I don't know about that, it sounds a little (wrist goes limp) to me." "I dunno - it's got some pretty nasty stuff hidden in it. You typically think of it being the province of old people in the park, but it's got groin kicks, hair pulls, eye gouges and all kinds of other moves in there." "Oh." (not getting the hint) "Yeah, it actually translates to something like 'Grand Ultimate Fist' " "Oh." (We all sip coffee.)

      I gotta tell you - I'm a little leery of this blogging thing. I did a little research earlier today and found blogs featuring:  Crazy Frames Text-That-Follows-Your-Pointer That Damned Ugly Flame Animated GIF and, yes, Cats  Of course, it's debatable who blogging is really for.  Maybe those people really *like* animated flame gifs.   Personally, I like a song I learned in kindergarten called "I am a Stegosaurus" (published by American Teaching Aids out of Minneapolis, MN in 1978).  It rolls off the tongue, it looks neat as the title, and there's a dance associated with it.   I am a stegosaurus, I'm a funny looking dinosaur for on my back are many bony plates and on my tail are more.  Ok - so it's not an earth-shattering way to start things out.  Probably not a whole lot better than pictures of cats, either.  But if you've ever seen me drunk enough to do the stegosaurus dance, you might get a kick out of this as a first post.  :)
