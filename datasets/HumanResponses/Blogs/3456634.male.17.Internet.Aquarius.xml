      Huh, I was discussing with Tori about her birthday today. I was asking her what she wanted, she said she wanted money because there was this thing she was lloking to buy. I figured that was a request that I could do. Then I was wondering how much I should get her. There is this other guy Ollie, he gets her $50 for her birthday, I want to one up him, that I guess would make me a better boyfriend or something. I don't know, its a guy thing, and I don't understand it. I was just sitting here writing an essay at a loss of words for once. Then I realized that Tori doesn't love me, I know that, and that if I can buy her love, I don't want that love. No matter how much I love to see her happy, that isn't a good thing to get her used to. As much as I wish it could happen there is an extremely small chance that I would marry her. That would be incredibly sweet, but it won't happen. So, I don't know what to do, I could give her $50 and a Teddy Bear like I was thinking of, or I could give her something else. I don't know, I want to talk to her some more, I want to talk to her a lot more.

      Tori said something incredibly mean today. She called me a stalker, I hope she was just kidding, it seems like it, but still those are hurtful words. Sre I may have been heading over to her house a lot recently, but it wasn't just to see her. 99.9% I go there I go to hang out with her brother Vinny. We would work on my car, or go shoot bees with airsoft guns or something stupid like that. I mean sure, seeing her beautiful smile and hearing her laugh is great, I absolutely love it. But only once have I gone to her house to see only her. I think that was a self centered thing to say. I may love her to peices, but I do believe in personal space. That was so incredibly hurtful, I just wanted to go cry. Hell, I still want to go cry. That was mean, incredibly mean, lucky for her I couldn't hold a grudge against her. Ohh well, at least I got to shoot bees today, they just sorta dissapear when you shoot them with an airsoft bb. Huh, that hurt, I should go cry.

      Dude, this is hella crazy. I'm thinking of Tori 24/7. I can't get her out of my mind. I keep on visulizing me just hanging out with Tori. Telling her that I love her, holding her hand. Talking to her, seeing that evil eye look. These are happy thoughts. I'm happy, very happy.

      Arg...  Now I am really confused. I don't know if I shuold Tell Tori's parents or not, tonight was a good night. I finally got to see Tori, all talkative, and I got to see that beautiful little evil eye look she gives me. I think things may really be looking up. And the weirdest thing happened last night, while I was sleeping, actual sleep for once, I woke up to roll over. Guess what the one thought was when I rolled over. That's right. You guessed it. "I love Tori". If that isn't love, what is? I mean, I wasn't even consious, I was just rolling over in a sleepy daze, and that is the one thing I thought. That was craziness. Today was good, I ate a bit too much at Cattlemen's but I am a Texan and I do love my steak. I'm happy for once. Things are looking good with Tori. I really want to establish with her that I am her friend. You can't have a good relationship if you aren't friends. So, I'm happy, I hope things work out with her, and I hope that tomorrow is just as good. Granted I have to clean my room, hopefully Vinny won't end up working so we could hang out for a bit, go shooting in the backyard, and maybe get some alone time with Tori. Because that would be a hella rad day.  HELLA RAD .

      As you can tell from the title I was watching this show "Love Hina". The main character Urashima is deeply in love with one of the tenants at the apartment thing. Everyday he gets teh shit beat out of him, like he is battered bruised, but he still comes back for more. The reason? Love of course, he loves Naru, but in this story you know that they love each other. Hell, I'd  take 10 15 good ass whuppings a day if in the end Tori loved me. That would definately be worth it. Well, I'm gunna go watch another episode.

      For the first time since tuesday I actually slept. It was amazing, I think it was because I haven't slept in so long. But, it happened. It's funny though, sometime over the course of last night I woke up to turn over, and when I did so one thought ran through my head. Guess what, that thought was I love Tori. Isn't that a shocker. Well, I feel good, I'm going to head to the mall to get some clothes and that is sweet. Well, I'm feeling good, for once.

      You know, I am still dying inside, and I don;t know why. Tori doesn't like me, I can live with that, I even talked to hr and played around a little bit. I did not once think about the fact that she didn't like me, it was like old times, just playing like friends. Sure, there is still pain from knowing that I will probably never end up dating her, but that isn't what is causing this pain. I don't know what it is. I think it may be because her parents don't know. As far as I can tel they think I am a cool, responsible kid. I know they don't hate me although I have been at their house quite a bit lately. So, maybe because I like them so much it hurts me that they don't know when they should. They should know how much I care about their daughter, they shouldknow how I feel but they don't. I guess since I really respect them and their opinions it hurts me to lie to them, to maybe even go as far to say betray their trust. But when they do find out, I hope they don't think I am just trying to "hit it and quit it" I would like a long, meaniful relationship with their daughter. I think of their daughter as the type of girl that I would like to marry some day. She is the type of girl I could be happy waking up next to morning after morning. The type of girl that I wan't to see happy for the rest of her life, the type of girl that should never be hurt. But, ohh well, I doubt they will see things that way. But regaurdless I am going to tell them what is up. I must, for I do not care to keep secrets. Especially one's of love.

      You know today has been crazy. I went to the junkyard with Vinny and his dad. For a good portion of the trip there was dead silence, I didn't know if he knew how I felt about his daugter or not. The wholt time I was thinking I'm gunna die. But beside that, some cliche phrases are true, no matter how much I hate all of them some of them are true. The one I was thinking of, Love is blind. Ya it is, I mean if it wasn't would I have fallen in love with a girl 4 years younger than me? Don't get me wrong she is incredibly beautiful, but if love wasn't blind, then my heart would have followed conformity and I would have gone afterr a pretty girl that was my age, even though in my experience that doesn't go well. But let's think, how did I fall in love with Tori. The first time I thought of her romantically, I can remember that clear as day. At that point she still looked like a little boy, whicjh is even funnier, because love would be EXTREMELY blind. I was waiting for her brother to finish playing some stupid online game, so I decided to go talk to Tori, I had never really thought of her as anything but annoying to that point, but I was so bored I had to do something. I went into tbe TV room to talk to her and she was drawing, I started talking to her about that. Then that lead to us going to her room, she showed me more of her drawings, I was quite impressed that those pictures were drawn by such an incredibly young girl. Then after talking about art, we started talking about other things. At that point I thought she was pretty cool, then of course her brother walks in the room at the WORST possible time ever and he drags me out of there. But that had to be the first time I thought of her as cool, and dateable. Then slowly as I talked to her more and got to know more about her I started to care about her more. This eventually got to the point I am at know, I love her. I just wish my memory was better. But the important thing is that I know that I love her. And I know that I am not just looking for a peice of ass. I find this really weird, I couldn't even picture myself having sex with her. I just can't picture it, I think that is weird as hell. I care about her so much that I don't want anything to ruin it, although it is ruined. Huh, I'm weird.

      Ha, I can't even watch an entire movie without thinking about Tori and wallowing in self pity, I think that really does verify teh fact that I am fucked up. I'm tired of love already, I want to enjoy life, but I can't I can't get Tori off of my mind. Everything reminds me of her, even some fucking crushed red peppers made me think of her. This is bullshit, I don't know what to do, or what else to say. I have said everything I feel to her, so why don't I feel any better? This sucks, I really just want to go dissapear, forget everything. But, I know that won't happen. I am lost, God help me...I need your love and guidance.

      Well, I'm back, I don't know who exactly I am saying that to but oh well....I feel bad, I feel like a dipshit, and I don't know why. Was I really wrong in spoiling Tori? I feel so bad for doing that because her mother may be right. I don't want her to want some guy that is super rich and that will spoil her. I want her to find true love, I want her to find hapiness. I guess in spoiling her all I was looking for was a smile, that second long glimpse of hapiness from her face. That was worth any amount of money, easily. But, I am still confused, and I always will be. Althoughthere has been one thing that is sort of annoying, Tori's brother is my friend and he knows I am incredibly hurt. But instead of saying something that means anything he spouts out bullshit cliche phrases like "You can't live with 'em, you can't live without 'em"....BULLSHIT. I can live with them and I cn live with her. If I couldn't imagine myself having a real future with her why would I even bother to tell her I love her. I may sound young and ignorant, which I proabably am, but if given the opportunity to marry Tori I would take it in a heartbeat. I may not get to sleep around or do a bunch of stupid shit that a normal college guy would but it would be worth it to know that when I got home the most amazing person in all of Earth would be waiting for me. Isn't that a great thought? So, all you people who have never loved someone and you give me shitty cliche phrases as advice fuck off. I still may like you as a friend, but your shitty phrases help no one, but yourself they only make yourself feel better. Another thing that worries me are Tori's parents, I don't know if they completely realize that their little girl is growing up, especially since she is maturing at an alarming rate. The signs that I care about Tori more than anything are obvious, but her mother still asks questions like "Why is Jon so nice to Tori?" and the answer is I believe that she should be treated nicely and that she should be spoiled. She deserves it for being such an awesome person. If no one else recognizes that fact I will work two, three, even a zillion times harder just to let her know that  SHE IS SPECIAL . So she is amazing, and even though I know she doesn't like me, I still love her. That sucks, love that is not mutual can be so hurtful, but at least it is harder to be let down after the initial downfall and stomping of the heart. Ha, I write so much, I should wither be an author a a loser who writes too much on the internet. Some guy who writes shit that no one will ever care about but him. Or maybe I need to work on my self image and stop being down about Tori, she doesn't care about me like I do about her, but I can live with that, and I should strive to better myself. If nothing else for her, for the dream that one day she will realize that I was being truthful when  I told her that I loved her and that she realizes that she loves me. Ha...I am a dreamer, but without dreams you would have no goal, and without a goal you would no ahve a purpose and without a purpose you are nothing. That is all for now, more posts coming soon! Probably very soon because I still can't sleep!

      I was about to attempt to sleep (good luck with that) and I had a great thought so I had to post it. Society sucks, society tries to define what is wrong and what is right, and I hate when people agree with those conformist fools. I am a conformist myself in appearance, I can live with that, but I can think outside of those fucked up conformist rules. If someone doesn't like something I do, they can go fuck themselves, if i  TRULY believe in something then I can live with myself on that decision. If someone would put their life on the line to stand up for something at least respect them. But that will never happen, and well...I would definately give up my life just so I could tell Tori that I love her, even if the feeling wasn't mutual.

      Well, this is my last post for today...I think it is hilarious that I post so much, because no one will ever read this. This is just a great way to communicate my emotions without fear or being shunned or criticized. Ohh ya, I created that other blog I was talking about. If you notice the url of this I screwed up when entering the url I wanted, I wanted superflyblog.blogspot.com and of course I added an "o" in there like an idiot. Ohh well, my new poetry blog is supoerflypoetry.blogspot.com, and this time it wasn't a typo. So...to the whole no one of an audience you should go there.

      Ha, this is hilarious, I'm home to sleep, and that is about it, but I seem to have the time to post 4 times a day. But another update on my drama of a life, I hate hiding things. I hate trying to keep things secret, especially from those I like. I told Tori how I feel, and that hasnt gone very well, she sort of ignored me today, maybe she is having a hard time like me. When I first stepped into her house today, I almost bursted into tears it hurt so bad. But after badly brusing a muscle I forgot about that whole ordeal, and I focused on making sure that I didn't break the bone. After that, I tried to cope with the fact that it probably wont work out, in fact there is at least a 75% chance it wont work out, no matter how much it hurts to say that, I believe it. Another funny thing is that her parents don't know, for those of you who don't me there is like a 4 year age difference between me and her, it doesn't bother me because I know she is more mature than most 14 and 15 year olds. But the thing is her parents don't know, and that really bothers me, I think the next day her dad is working (I think that is monday, because fires don't stop for holidays) I will tell her mom, I want to make sure it is ok with Tori first, but it is killing me to keep a secret like this. I don't know what to expect when I tell her though, I don't realy care, I would take a good ass whupping as long as I didn't have to keep this secret. I can accept what ever comes my way, even if it is to never see Tori again, no matter how much it hurts I will respect her parents wishes. Ha, it is funny to think that one day Tori's mom will be reading this. If I was smart I would edit stuff, but I can't stand to lie to her, she is nice, and I don't think she would go apeshit because I like to express my emotions, and it's not like anyone knows about this anyways. Wow, this has been interesting... My heart ripped out, and stepped on, and my sould tortured for having to keep a secret. I would tell tomorrow, but I think Tori's dad would flip because I love his little girl, although I wan't them to know I fear death, and I think Tori's mom could handle this better than Tori's dad. I dunno, when I read this in the future I'll notice that I wrote things over and over again. Oh well, I can't think straight, I can't sleep, I can't function and I can barely stand the sight of Tori's parents or even their house. It just conjurs up these feelings, these feelings that are unexplainable, these feelings that make me want to go and cry. Ohh, and as a note when I said I was going to go off and cry, nost of the time I did. I dunno, I suck, and I can live with that. Hopefully one day I can find a woman as amazing as Tori (it's doubtful) and we will fall in love with each other. Or even better, as Tori matures more (we both have a long way to go) maybe Tori will fall in love with me. Wow, I like to ramble and sleep deprivation doesn't help any. Silly me...and I'm still that nervous pie...I dunno...I'm going to quit rambling, and hopefully I can sleep for once, that will be a nice change. Ohh, and if Tori's mom does end up reading this, I'm sorry for not telling you earlier, I really wanted to give Tori a chance to get to terms with what I had said before telling you, and if you never want to see me again I can live with that fact, it was worth it just to tell Tori how I felt. No hard feelings will be felt. And I will start another blog for poerty I have written either about my situation with Tori, or for Tori. I do love to write, it is the best medium of all, and best of all...you can spell check. With words if you stutter you just sound stupid.

      Today was cool, as I mentioned earlier in class we got to rewrite a section of Catcher in the rye, of course that was cool because we got to be as obscene as ever. I mean things were great, it was the best skit of the day. It was going great, obscenities left and right, and then BAM! out of nowhere the deaf translator in our class Zen Destiny got incredibly mad. As you can probably tell this guy is a hippy, not by looks, but once you speak to him, he screams hippy. Getting back to the story, he got mad and said that this play was disrespectful to the teacher (who was laughing the entire time) and to him. So we stopped right after my first line. My first line was 1 word, "fuck". Then we stopped and no one else wanted to go, they knew that our skit owned theirs, and that we rule them, and that we will for all eternity.

      I realized today that I screwed up again...How many times can a man make a mistake before he changes his ways? I was, am, and always will be too idealistic. I hoped for the best and expected the best. One should always hope for the best and expect the worst. That is exactly what I did not do...But in love one can not be logical. I may use that as an excuse, and I probably will. Ohh well, this shit still hurts like hell. I don't know how I am going to face Tori today, or tomorrow...

      Well, yet another update in my so called life. Things are looking better, I don't feel like dynig, but I am still hurt...I was talking to Vinny, as a medium to his sister (I don't want their parents to know what is happening yet, I wan't her to make a decision before naything serious)...but anyways I was talking to Vinny and I asked him to talk to his sister for me, earlier today I had told her what I wanted to do (see the blog below) and umm I realized that I should ask her what she wants me to do. So I did...and this is a good sign, she wants me to keep coming over to hang out with her brother, to keep coming over and to not act like nothing ever happened....I'll take that as a good sign

      Wow,    Today is the worst day ever.  EVER . I finally told the girl I love that I love her...and today I went back to see her and guess what. "I like you, but there is this other person who likes me". In my mind that basically means I suck, and I should go jump off a cliff for being such a retard. I wanna cry...nothing has ever hurt this much, this hurts more than being shot. Although in a manner of words I was shot, my dreams and hopes were shot down. Gunned hown by the only girl I ever loved, isn't that ironic. At least I do have one thing to show...I have this 2nd degree burn on my right arm, from when I was fighting Tori's brother so I could tell her I loved her. Well, I have a scar from war, the war of love, and it seems as if I have lost, yet again. At least this time I know that I loved her, and that will never change, she will always be the first, and maybe last girl I ever loved. Maybe by the last things I said to her she will realize that my love is true, the last thing I said was something like (keep in mind I am not the best speaker, especially when nervous) "Tori...umm...I had this beautifully orchrestrated speech, but I totally forgot it, oh well. Ohh I remember, I'm tired of running away, that's all I've ever done...umm...Well I'm not going to run away, I feel like I would be betraying you if I just ran away, and I'm not going to do that. I'll always be here for you, always...and ohh ya I don't think I said this in spoken words yesterday, but I love you." God...please help me...     Now, I think it is time to go crawl into a hole and cry...                                                                                    Jon

      Yesterday had to be one of the most interesting days in a while...I finally told Tori how I feel. That came after a nice fight with her over protective brother. I had discussed this with him before, and I made sure to get his blessing first, but of course when the time came, he resisted. This proved to be detrimental to my arm...his actions surprised me and he burned me with a can of compressed air. I couldn't believe it, that was such a crappy fight...I had to bust out some judo and I kicked his ass. So after that fiasco I finally told Tori how I feel...This has me more worried than ever before, for I believe that I am the first guy to tell her that he loves her, that has to be such a hard time emotionally. I decided to give her some time to think, so I went out, got her some food and a teddy bear. When I got back I gave the stuff to her, and one thing she said sticks out in my mind, it was something to the effect of  Tori-"You know who this bear reminds me of? It's got red hair..." While she said that I was thinking that she was thinking of her dad but shortly thereafter she said; Tori-"Jon" I could only hope by that she meant I was like her big cuddly bear...but you never know. Then after that I decided to go rotate my tires, that was a blast. So I decided to give her the night to think, and I have to talk to her today. We shall only see what happens...and ohh ya I have to dress that burn from yesterday...her brother sure can be a fucktard.

      Well,   I realized today that love really does hurt. There is this one girl, (I won't mention names) that I love, I mean I absolutely love her with all of my heart. The only prbolem is that I don't know if she loves me, and this is really ahrd to live with. Just hearing her voice makes my knees weak, and my heart flutter, but I don't know what to do. So I deliberated what to do, and I figured out that I must be forethcoming otherwise I could never live with myself. So I have to tell her, that is the only option....so please pray for me in this adventure, for love is uncertain. So let it be known that I love this girl with all my heart...well I guess if I'm going to tell the world that I love her I should at least say her first name. I LOVE VICTORIA P. AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT TOUGH HORSE PUCKEY.

      This is the last post, for all of those whom read everyword of this blog. The time has come for this to be over...  Well, today has been pretty shitty, I almost cried, which is amazing because I have only cried once in the last few months, that was when I read Marie's response to how I love her daughter. Today I almost cried because the pain of not seeing Tori, or getting to talk to her. As each second passes memories get cloudier, pain rises, and my happiness decreases, for she is the center of my life as I know it...Here is the hierarchy of my life  1: God of course 2: Victoria 3: Friends (Includes Tori's parents) 4: High performance driving; (In order of importance) Drag racing, Drifting, Street Racing 5: Myself 99999999999: Stupid people   As you can see Tori takes number 2, but of course God is number one, that would be silly if he wasn't on there. I am more careful, more self aware, and more thoughtful now that I love her. She gives my life some reason, some hope. Life is nothing without hope. Well, the main point is that I love Tori, and I care deeply about her family. I want us to be friends, while still staying in the boundaries that her parents set. I want things to work out, and I am sure they will, in their fucked up little ways. If I didn't believe that things would work out what type of person would I be? I dunno, to most of the people that read this I love you, as a friend, or in Tori's parents, I love you as family, and to Tori, I love you more than life itself, I love you more than I can comprehend...  Remember one people one love Peace out, and I will miss you blog  @#^&$ JON @#*&$#

      Holy shit this sucks. Rochelle is doing really bad emotionally, and I feel realy bad. I know there is nothing I can do, but I want to try. She is a friend of mine, and I hate it when friends are hurting. I care abouth her, just like I do with Vinny, or Chris. There is nothing I can do, she is really depressed, and I want to help. Tomorrow I will call her and see if she wants to hang...Hopefully I can make her feel a little bit better. I love her, but only as a friend (aka not like I love Tori) I hope there is something I can do....  I wish that Tori and I could be good friends, I love her so much that I can't even understand it, maybe one of these days I will express it through written words

      You are neither more nor less dateable than your peers— welcome to the land of mediocrity, home of the masses! You have an undeniable animal magnetism, but you're just as likely to attract small animals as you are to attract human beings. Nevertheless, the people you flirt with generally find you funny and cute, or "fute." You have good hygiene, which is an imporant aspect of relationships involving two or more people. Avoid seafood and walks in the woods.

      Love hurts, don't it? You're in pure love—the kind with sonnets and hovering cherubs—and you ache like an old man's back for your crush. The superficial things that other people care about—money, looks, body odor—don't hold much water with you. You wouldn't care if your dreamboat were the Exxon Valdez, so don't be surprised if you ever fall in love with an oily barge. Respect the twinkie, but don't ignore its needs.

      Well well, what a predicament....what exactly that is I don't know, but sure as hell it sucks...Ya, I don't know what I am talking about either, I'm just sitting here chillin' listening to Marley. I still can't get Tori off of my mind, I really want to talk to her, I want to see her. I want to hang out with her, maybe next time hse is babysitting I could be of assistance. I had a lot of fun last time I helped her. She is a lot of fun to be around, being friends with her is awesome. I wish we could be better friends, although I don't know what the major roadblock in that is...I will have to figure that out soon.

      Wow, today is quite a painful day. Love hurts like hell, but it is also so great. How can that be? Something so painful yet so beautiful? I just want to cry right now, to burst into tears this hurts so bad, but one thing makes it all better, Tori. The sound of her laugh, the sight of her face, the memories of her smile, make all of this heart wrenching pain so worth it. I want to cry yet smile, I want to escape, yet be there...I want to run away, yet remain for love. Hell, I may just start crying, love is crazy, and I don't know how to express myself properly. I don't know what to do, sometimes I just wish this was one of those stupid little kid "loves" that I used to know, where I could get over one in a week. But this, this is for real, my love for Tori is constant. My thoughts of her perpetual, my sadnessnever ending. Yet I keep on living for hope gives me strength and love keeps me moving...

      hm...I am bored out of my mind...and to top it off I am depressed...I don't know if Tori knows that I just want to be friends for now or what. Everytime I see her I get vibes that she likes me, but everytime I ask her if she wants to hang out she says no. Mabe she fears that her dad will hurt me or something like that, or maybe it just is a large jumo to hang out with me, maybe she has the mentality that it would be a date.  I don't really know, although one time she really wanted to hang out with me but Vinny wouldn't let it happen. I wish he wasn't so overprotective around her, although I do want a serious relationship with Tori I can live with just being friends for a while, so he should accept that, although I know he won't. At least I asked her, that is what is important, now, in time hopfully Tori and I can be good friends....

      Hmm...it is friday, you know what that means? The show at the phoenix, Grubb N Dubb, Shakedown, Bareknuckle Boxing, and Toast Machine. It will be good, but chnaces are I won't go, too bad... I love Tori so much, I can't get her off of my mind, she is so perfect, so beautiful, I just want t hang out with her. Being friends with her is cool, because after being friends for 5 years our bond can only get stronger, and hopefully I can be friends with her. I don't want her parents to think that I am trying to date her if I ask if she wants to hang out. I can live with being friends for the next 5 years, because that is nothing. By the time that is up, I should have my bachelors degree and I could try to work somewhere where I could help support her, if she needed it. I love her so much I can't even understand....Ohh well, I guess I better get going soon, I have to do stuff and things, like go shopping...

      Well, today was pretty fuckin cool...I got to put a tach in my car, get a new shift knob/boot on there. I got to meet Jim, and I got to hang out. The only thing that could have made the day better was if Tori was there. She has been on my mind the entire day, I just can't stop thinking about her. What really boggles my mind is how much I love her. I can't understand it, my feelings for her are so strong, it is just crazy. I can't keep my love for Tori under radar anymore, I am in love, and it is amazing.... Ohh on another note, my mom is so stereotypical, I told her that Jim could hook me up with a cheap bike, the only thing that mattered was the price, if it is cheap enough I can get it...Whatever, who knows what she is thinking.... Hey, I am going to bed, because I am tired, and I love Tori so much I  can't wait to see her tomorrow...hopefully I will....

      All day today I have been thinking about Tori and how amazing she is....I just can't seem to get her off of my mind, today is definately one of those days where you feel like you are in love, where you know that you are in love, and that it is great to be in love. Sure there is pain, but seeing her today made all of that go away, just seeing her face makes everything better. Like when I saw her I forgot about the key, I just thought about how amazing and beautiful she is...I'm in love and I'm damn proud to admit it.

      I am retarded....I broke my car key today, at a garage....silly me...I brok it trying to open the package for my tach...So I have to drive this big, wide ugly ass fuckin' truck and I hate it...Ohh well... I got to see Tori today, and God, did she look beautiful. I should have asked if she needed any help with babysitting, but I have a feeling that her parents wouldn't like that idea. Ohh well, one of these days I will try...There seems to be a lot of regret in my life, I use the phrase "Ohh well" too much...Life goes on, and I should stop being such a pussy.

      Man, it is too early to e up....It sucks, I fell asleep about midnight and I just woke up...less than 6 hours of sleep...Fun... It is times like this I wonder why we have emotions, being in love isn't too cool right now. I want to see Tori, I want to talk to her, I want to be friends with her, but it isn't happening...and I don't know why, why can't we just be friends, I can settle for that, as long as I can see her that is all I want, I just want to be in her presence....I don't know, I want to see her today, and I want to try to do anything so we can be better friends.

      I was watching a preview for 50 First Dates. I have seen that movie a lot and I know what it feels like to bei n the main character's shoes. The whole thing with Tori is on a day to day basis, some days she is really sweet and some days she is just sort of quiet and out of the way. I don't dislike that, I just think it is sort of odd, I go to her house wondering what kind of mood she will be in and whether or not she will like me.  I don't know... Although I am still worried, I hope Vinny's mom isn't too mad at me, I really do still want to hang out with Vinny and I really want to be friends with Tori...God, I wish that would happen, I know she is like a hella cool friend. Ohh well, things will work out...hopefully... I figured a few things out, I really want to learn how to work on cars, so fal semester at the JC I want to take a class on car repair and mateninence. I will not be taking the lab class though. Ohh well, hopefully one of these days I can live up to Vince's standards and the standards he set for Tori. Isn't it odd how fathers set the bar for what kind of guy's grils will date? It's alright, even before I thought of Tori romantically I always saw how I could end up like Vince. This motorcycle riding, car fixing, fit(I'll be there one day soon), cool guy that is deeply in love. You wouldn't hink it when you first met him, but after talking to him for a while you know he is still in love with Marie, and I think he does believe in love. Like he didn't flip his cookies when he found out that I loved Tori. Marie definately still loves Vince, that is obvious as hell, she is quite protective of him. But those two still love each other. I want that kind of relationship with whomever I marry (hopefully Tori ;-]), I don't want to be in a loveless marriage like my parents.  I gotta shape up, stop fucking up, get fit, learn how to work on cars, learn how to ride a motorcylcle, stop cursing so much. and be really good friends with Tori. I think I can do that by the time I turn 18.... 7 months and counting down.... Good night and God bless

      Don't get me wrong, I love having something like this to express myself through and I think it is great that the world can know how I feel, but I am worrying about Tori's mother, this has to be hard to read everyday, to read about how much I love her daughter. To read about my feelings everday....I don't know if she reads these or not, but this has to be hard. She must have expected someone to fall in love with Vinny before someoe fell in love with Tori, the younger of the two. I think I can stop these, I dont want to cause anymoe emotionaltrauma than I already have. I think she knows that I care about her daughter, that I would never do anything to harm her, and that I love her, and I always will. She knows that I wouldn;t do something against her wishes and I wouldn't do anything to violate the trust she has for me (or at least what is left of it). She knows that I just want to be friends with Tori for now, and she knows that she is almost like a second mother to me and Vince almost like a second father. So she should know that I care...and I don't think I should stress certain things as I do in this blog. So the days of me posting on this may be over, they will be effective 06/19/04 12:01 am, unless Marie requests that I keep on posting so she has some sort of grasp on my emotional situation.

      That DMV handbook pisses me off, it made me think of Tori. I was reading it when I came across the part on passengers, it made me think of the time I saw Tori on her dad's Harley. God, did she look beautiful, but then again when doesn't she look amazing?  Another thing that got me was that everything was the major cause of accidents, so theoretically I would get into an accident while taking a sharp turn too fast, while in a parking lot, while tailgating, with bad conditions and poor braking skills, and I would hit something stationary, while a car that isn't looking hits me. Seems like a hard situation to get into, all those things going wrong at once. Crazy shit, eh?

      This day has gone by pretty fast, it has been adventure filled. This morning I went to some German guy's house to look at a bike, it had no compression, but there was another one, it was $800 but it was a pretty sweet bike. I wish I had the money....Oh well... The more I think about it, the more reasons Marie has to dislike me, this sucks, but I wouldn't like some guy that loved my daughter, no matter how responsible or nice he was. Cliche phrases suck, and "Love hurts" is the worst one ever, because it does hurt and it sucks, but is great at the same time...How many times can I bitch about that in one day...Ohh well, time to suck up, and become more responsible...I'm almost an adult (Scary thought, I am still such a little kid)...Ohh well, at least I fancy myself a good driver...

      That is it, I have had the best dream of all time, ever. It started out like this,, Vinny and I were chillin at his house, and his parents were gone for the weekend. So he decided to go so something stupid, and Tori went into the living room, I told her that I loved her and then she whispered it to me and we embraced each other. All we did was lay on the couch and hold each other not a spoken word said for quite a while, she knew that I loved her and I knew that she loved me. After holding each other for a while wesat down on the floor and she suggested that we run away, and that we get married, and live happily ever after. Of course being responsible me I said no, but all I asked for was one quick kiss, and I got it. What in the fuck beats that, just holding Tori, with the nkowledge that we love each other, nothing more than just holding each other, no talking, no kissing, no sec (for all you dirty minded people), just her in my arms and me in hers. How wonderful, I have to have dreams like that more often...just thinking about it makes me all warm and fuzzy inside. That is one of those dreams that should definately come true. Fo' Sho'....

      This is amazing, how can one guy bitch and complain so much, especially because I say the same thing over and over again... 1: I love Tori- That isn't bitching, but the honest to God truth 2: I just want to be friends with Tori- That would be sweet, but I don't see it happening with the parental situation 3: I wish things would work out- Things rarely work out in life like you would like, especially when you are an idealist like me 4: Why does it always have to be about sex- I haven't said this alot but it is true, doesn't anyone believe in love anymore? Why can't I have a deep relationship without sex 5: I hope Vinny takes  the fact that I love his sister well- Well, I can't say that I have said this a lot either, but I think it is really starting to hit him that I really do love his sister, that must scare him 6: I hope Tori's parents dont take this the wrong way- I want them to know I want something else besides sex with their daughter, I can understand how they wouldn't believe that, even though it is true 7: Why are the ladies all over me now that I am in love- Holy crap this is a bad one, like today this attractive latina chick was eyeballing me at Wendy's, but I am in love so she was SOL, and I Laura (my co worker) is also SOL...Sorry ladies, I may not be taken, but I am in a position where I can't date 8: I'm confused- How true, this is an incredibly confusing time of my life, I must learn to live with confusion and pray that I am being guided along the right path, know that Jah (God) will lead the way  That is all I feel like typing right now...as I said earlier, pray for me, and hope that things work out....0:-)

      Fuck...I am hella worried...Vinny hasn't been doing his chores, and I hope his mom doesn't blame me. Although if I were her I would think of me as a pretty damn good person to blame. She has various reasons to dislike me, this just being another one. Sure, I am nice, and respectful, and I love her daughter...Wait that last one would not be a positive thing. Well, when I think about it is, because I love her, I don't lust after her. But I would still be the perfect person to blame. Another thing that sorta has me worried is the fact that I stopped by earlier today, the purpose being to see if Tori wanted to do something. I hope Marie didn't get the wrong impression by that, since I can't date Tori, I at least want to be friends, but I can't see that in the forseeable future. Damn that sucks, I still want to hang out with Vinny and I want to hang out with Tori, but things don't seem to be going to well in that department. I think I will have to go back to, do your fucking work or I will demolish you. To Vinny so he stops fucking up, because screwing up is bad. Ohh and another thing, I screwed up was when I called to leave a message for Vinny. I expected the answering machine to pick up, but instead Tori did and I froze, I was speechless, I try so hard to keep from being too stupid around her, so she unexpectedly answered and I screwed up. Damn me....Love sucks, but is so good at the same time...How can something so painful be so amazing? Ohh well, hopefully things will start to work out, and hopefully Tori and I can be friends, let us pray that will happen... ;-) God bless, and please pray that things work out, for it is love that I am after and love should be the one thing that God would happily endorse...

I went to go see Tori and she can't do anything because she has to take care of her cat, so I am SOL and laughing. I don't know why but I am happy, but I don't know why...at least later today I get to rebuild an engine...

      Why does my mom have to be home? This sucks, this totally kills my day. I wanted to go out and do stuff, I didn't want to be yelled at all day. Ohh well, I guess I will go see if Tori wants to do anything later, although my prediction is that she will say no, or that her mom will say no...that sucks :-(, If I can't date her I at least want to be her friend...I wish things would work out already. Ohh well, loves hurts, I have to live with that.

I want her to know that she can trust in me, confide in me, know that I am here to support her....Well that is what I must do, now back to trying to sleep. Ciao

      I just realized something. Porn isn't as cool as people say it is. I mean sure it can be entertaining. But what they dp is defile the most intimate act a man and woamn can do with each other. THat just sort of nullifies it importance in a relationship and it's meaning emotionally. I don't know....damn love and its pain...Ohh well, at least I have happy thoughts to keep the pain at bay.

I don't know, but it is funny, Laura my co-worker got mad because I like designer clothes. That is funny...I can't stop laughing...Well, I don't think she is attracted to me any more...;-) Ohh well...I think I should see if Tori wants to hang out this week, chillin' sounds like fun right about now.

      Why is everything about sex? I mean holy shit, I tell my parents that I like some girl and the first thing they ask is "Have you had sex?". Usually that isn't too bad, but then I tell my parents that I seriouslyt care for Tori, and they automatically assume that we have een having sex, "So is the sex good?". My goal with Tori is to have a deep, meaningful relationship, not to fuck her. If these people can't realize the fact that I love her and that I am not after sex, then tey should just go away. Why does everything have to be about sex? What happened to spending time together as friends, holding hands, looking into each other's eyes, hell even just chillin' watching tv together. It isn't all about sex, so if you are one of those people who just think about me and Tori having sex stop. It is going to be an extremely long time before that happens. Trust ne, I want this relationship to build, if nothing else I just want to be good friends with Tori. So stop asking me if I had sex with her, the answer is no, and the answer is I don't want to have sex with her. We both have a great deal of maturing before that,  I mean att least 5 years of maturing, my guess is it would probably be longer than that. So, bugger off, I don't want to "fuck" her, get that through your head.  I'm done ranting, although some stupid people can't realize that a guy would want something other than sex.

      Well, it is the real first day of summer, a monday and I am doing nothing. I have a feeling that today will be a little boring/painful. The first thing I thought when I woke up this morning was "I love you Tori", I can't get her off of my mind. I'm thinking about every time I fucked up, I hate screwing up. I just want her to be happy, ehy do I have to be the stereotpical guy? Ohh well...maybe I can think up a way to keep from fucking up too much. As long as she knows that I would never intentionally hurt her....I'm still confused/nervous/scared plus I am a little sad because I probably won't see Tori today. Off to the shower.

      Ha, one of my friends told me I was obsessed with Tori. I guess it is true in a way, but I use this blog as a way to communicate my emotions, not to tell people what I did in a day. This is an emotional relaase and  honestly my love for her has my emotions by the balls. I am scared, nervous and confused. If I could talk to her about this stuff I probabl wouldn't be writing all of this, hell if I could even talk to Marie about this I wouldn't write as much. But one should tell their emotions somehow or else I believe that the bottled up emotions could be detremental to my health. So if it seems like I am obsessed with Tori that isn't incredibly true, I do love her and I do think about her during the day, but I am focused on other things during the day too, like fixing that motorcycle, or just having fun, but nothing usually impacts me emotionally as this does. So this is all pure emotion nothing else. Just an emotional release, this is what I feel throughout the day, it isn't what I think about all day. This is tiny bits and peices of my emotional life put togther. This is almost like a confessional for me. So please, don't give me a bunch of shit because I write so much about Tori, I just need somewhere where I can express myself without fear. I don;t know...all I do know is that i am nervous/scared/confused, and theonly other thing I know is that I love Tori...Other than that I am lost, I need a touch of direction in my life. We shall see what will happen...TTYL

      Today was pretty sweet, I got to have a lot of fun. The day started sort of slow, washed my car, and I didn't do too much. Tori was babysitting, and I really wanted to help, but I didn;t want her parents to get the wrong idea and her friend came over so she was pretty set there. Then afterwards we went to this lady's house and Vinny did some work on her little ranch thingamabob. Then we went to go check out her motorcycle...a 1975 Yamaha that hadn't been started in 20 years. We had a realy good time working on that, we got it running, although only half of the engine actually ran. I don't think I got it above 30 mph. So we spent a god amount of time doing that, then we went back to his house. They were having a barbeque, Tori mentioned it, I figure that she probably wanted me to stay...but of course I am a guy and I didn't realize it until after I left. Silly me...Ohh well, as long as she knows that I care about her I am happy. I think in 5 years we could have a real relationship, I think it is feaseable. I love her, and I believe things will work out, but if I didn't have hope would I really love her? Would I want to keep on going day after day? Probably not, I still wonder how Marie feels about the fact that I love her daughter, I would like to discuss the issue with her, but I don't see that in the foreseeable future. Although I really want to talk to Tori to see how she feels she is not the type to talk to anyone but who she feels really secure with, which would be her mom. That is understandable, I still wonder how she feels about me. I love her and I things will work out, that is what is most important.  On another note I felt so stylish today, I had on a total Guess outfit, I had it goin on, I had some really nice Guess cargos, with a plain white undershirt and a button up white guess shirt that was un buttoned. I had the whole half tuck thing going on, it was hella P-I-M-P, I just wish I had a fatty belt buckle, that woulda been sick as hell....Well, I think this will be my only post for the day so, TTYL and take care.

      Ahh, I am homr again, what is there to say? The surgeon dude was coool, next month I get some teeth pulled, and then after that I dunno. I went to Pacific Super Market and got some AZN candy, and I went and got clothes...fun! Although throughout the course of the day I have not been able to stop thinking of Tori, luckily I don't focus on the negative. I was thinking about everytime I saw her smile, and that brought my mood up. I found the perfect gift for her birthday, it will cost a little more than anticipated, but I think Tori will like it. Well, I should go for now...people to chat with.

Then I don't really know where to, but it will be fun hopefully. Maybe I will go down to Muddy waters or something cool like that. I don't know...   Today won't be as bad as I said, but there will be one majorly sucky part to the day. I won't see Tori, and I have to learn how to live with that, but it hurts. I want to see her beautiful face, hear one of her cute laughs...Well, I am leaving now, so TTYL.

      Another day has gone by, for the most part it was fun. But, things are starting to go downhill. I am getting sick, which of course is always tons of fun. Also I am sort of worried, I think Vinny finally realized that I actually love his sister and I think he is hurt. I feel bad, but I can't help it. I love Victoria, it wasn't my choice to fall in love with her. I am glad that I did, this has been one od the most amazing things ever. But there is never love without pain, nad I am in agony everyday, and I live with that, for I will live through the bad times to see the good. I will endure the  crying to see Tori smile, I will endure the pain to make sure she is happy. In the end, it will all be worth it, I have faith in things, but most of all I have faith in my love for Tori.   Well, I am going to sleep, I feel like crap.

      Darn, I want to see Victoria, but I don't want her parents to get the wrong idea. They know that I love her, but I want them to know that I will respect their wish of holding off dating her for a while. Although I can't date her, I still want to hang out with her, she is a lot of fun to hang out with. Maybe some day soon I can help her take care of a little one again. Who knows...off to food!

      Wow, this is hilarious. Ever since I realized that I love Tori girls have been after me. What the fuck? It isn't like Tori and I are dating right now, because of our age difference, but crap. This is ridiculous. I couldn't bring myself to date anyone because I could never love her as I love Tori, and I couldn't have a fling because I feel that would be betraying Tori's trust....Who knows what will happen... I'm really happy how well things went, I thought I was going to be destroyed. But I wasn't, it was pretty cool. I could have never respected myself if I didn't go to talk to Vince. That is just running away, and I won't do that anymore. Plus, since I really do love her what is there to worry about? Even the bible says that pure love hath no fear.  I'm quite a bit more optimistic today, I can only hope that things will work out between Tori and my self. I really love her, and although 5 years may seem like a lot to some, it is nothing for love. This really gives me motivation for later in life, I can be somewhere in life by the time Tori starts college. I could try to help her, I just wonder if she will want to go out of state for college...Well, back to work.

      This is funny, I have posted so much today, that makes me like a super loser. Sometimes I wonder if I write too much. But today went amazingly well, I am quite happy, I just wonder how Tori feels. I didn't get to talk to her today. That was dissapointing, but I want her parents to realize that I can wait 5 years to date her, but until then I want to be friends. I don't know, I don't think writing that over and over again will help any, but maybe, you never know. Huh, I wonder how Marie is doing, she was unusually quiet, I feel bad fo hurting her like that, but I can't feel too bad, because it wasn't my choice to fall in love with her daughter and my best friends little sister. Ohh well, I hope she copes with this well, this probably is sooner than expected, Marie if you ever end up reading this I apologize. Don't worry, I would never do anything to hurt Tori and I would never do anything to violate your wishes. Remember you are almost like a second mother to me. Vince, if you ever read this I hope that you umm, I dunno, I don't really know what to say to you. I think you are pretty cool and thanks for going easy on me today. I was expecting to get a new asshole. You are pretty cool and I understand where you come from when you say the cliche phrase "If you make my daughter cry, I make you cry" although I was expecting something a little more original, something like "If you make my daughter cry I'll break your legs." Broken legs, now that is a detterant, it would make it awful hard to get to Tori to apologize if I made her cry. I fidn it funny, if it wasn't for Vinny, I would have never fallen in love with Tori, not for the fact that he is her brother. But for the fact that one day he was playing UO and I was bored as hell, so I talked to Tori, that was when I discovered how cool she was. Otherwise later in life when she gets incredibly hot I would have lusted after her, I wouldn't love her like I do now. I really do hope that Vinny will accept this. I think he refuses to believe that I love Tori, I think I can get him used to the thought in the next 5 years, eh? That is enough time to make almost anyone believe almsot anything. I still think it is funny how you said "possible son-in-law", I may love Tori, but I don't believe that she has feelings for me, although 5 years is enough time to become good friends. Hmm... I am thinking quite a bit. You know I couldn't believe it, your house is like in the perfect spot. I love that house, and I love the park right next to the house. I had a rockstar, to mentally prepare me for getting ripped a new asshole, (the smiles, and lack of being able to pay attention) but I looked at the park, holy crap. It was so beautiful and serene. I mean with all of the caffiene and other stuff in a rockstar my pupils contracted, making what I saw sharper. You really don't notice how beautiful the world around you is until you open yuor eyes and look. I think over the summer I will have to grab a rockstar and go to Roberts Lake. That place is so quiet, it will be nice to lay back, and observe the world. It is funny how something so small can be so major. Beauty surrounds us all day and we never realize it, this summer will be a time to open my eyes to the world. To grasp its complexity and beauty, to experience what few will and to be in a state of thoughtless pure serenity. If it sounds too good to be true it isn't, using drugs or alcohol is not the way to see the world in a new light. I just have to open my mind, my body and my spirit. Then afterwards I will have to write of the experience and the amazingness that surrounds us day in and day out without our knowledge. What is the point of discovering something so amazing if I never share it with anyone? I shall share with all, with those I love and those I dislike, for one should be open to almost everything. Hate should not be in our vocabulary, for hating somenoe does nothing, not for you or him. Hate only festers other problems in our life, love opens our eyes to true beauty, while hate blinds.  Remeber, never hate those who hate, for hate helps no one and hate is bred from ignorance. If we teach the world how diversity is useful than hate shall stop. Whosoever reads this, please help stop hate. Promote love, peace and kindness, for if you help someone, you not only help them, but you help yourself. Alright I am done writing for the day, good night and blog ya later!

      Man, that went pretty well. I thought Tori's dad would have gotten mad, but instead I got drilled sort of. I tried to be as honest as possible. I think that solidified the fact that I love Tori, although 5 years may seem like a long time I can live with that, I just hope Tori and I can be friends until the point and time we can date. Because without friendship how can you have love? Well, lets see how things turn out. Although I find it sort of funny, he asked why I keeo a diary online, and I responded, I don't care what people think, if they don;t like what I feel they can go fuck themselves. It may not be the best wording, but it is true, there are few people whos opinion I care about. That would be Tori and her family. My parents, and most of my friends, and most family friends too. It isn't like I am an angry person, and I hate anyone. I don't think I have anything to hide. If you don't like the fact I love Victoria there is nothing you can do. So, I think my grlling went well. As long as he knows that I love his daughter and I will do all in my power to treat her accordingly, while respecting their wishes. I will definately try to provide the best I can for her in the future if we ever get into a serious relationship. I hope they know the truth, and I pray that Tori and I can still be friends, I enjoy hanging out with her, I have a lot of fun with her. Like I said before when she was taking care of that little girl, it was a lot of fun, and I hope Tori and I can hang out more. Just as friends albeit but I don't think there is anything wrong with being friends with her, because friendship is a strong base for a relationshio. Another thing I hope is that I can stay friends with Vinny. I have asked him again and again if it is okay with him, and he said it was. It isn't like I wanted to fall in love with my best friends sister, shit just sorta happens. Love truly is blind. But without love then what is there to life? Not knowing what will happen is half of the fun, the other half is actually living it. I dunno, I am in a good mood, and my secondary parental units seem to be okay with the fact that I love their little girl. Although I still wonder, he asked me if this is the first time I have been in love, to which I responded yes. In the past I have been in what I thought was love, but it was NOTHING like this at all. I dunno, dinner awaits, I think I shall go eat, and I will probably return soon to write even more.

      Ha, I think today will be one of those days where I write an incredible amount. You know why? Because I am nervous, scared, and most of all confused. I figured out what I am going to do with Tori, but I just can't figure myself out. I am confusing, Tori is right. I mean, I should know myself and I can't? I have three little letters for myself WTF. Ohh man, I am such a loser, it is so funny, it is fucking hilarious. Ha, I feel sort of bad for Vinny though, I heard that he got an earful about this issue this morning, but ohh well, I think this is for the better. At least I have figured some things out and I am taking real steps into adulthood, I am not regressing as I was. I am saying good bye to being a little kid, and I am accepting adulthood, no matter how much it sucks. So, while I am confused like I am right now I will probably write a lot. I don't know about what but I have a feeling I will average 20 posts a week soon. Maybe I write too much, I should get a real hobby like being a shouvenistic pig. (j/k) I think I should start doing something important in my life, something that will not only affect me, but the entire world. I want to make a difference. I want to be something. We shall see how that goes, although I really do hope that Tori wants to be friends with me, I have a really good time hanging out with her, and I want to continue to hang out with her. Ohh and I actually said something smart last month. (I know, I'm amazed too.) "Then I realized that Tori doesn't love me, I know that, and that if I can buy her love, I don't want that love. No matter how much I love to see her happy, that isn't a good thing to get her used to." Well I am done for now. I shall post later today, an update on how the new asshole ripping went.

      I wish I had the stereotypical summer sometimes, hanging out at home, partying every nught. Getting fucking wasted at a party all of the time. But I know that won't happen this summer I am being quite reflective, and that sort of sucks, but at the same time it is a blessing. I realized it recently, I'm getting older and it sucks, but I have to stop being such a little kid. I need to mature quite a bit, I think that will happen over the course of the summer. I am immature, idiotic and down right stupid most of the time. But I have learned that my emotions must be followed, yet surpressed. My life should he fun yet controled, and I should grow up. Being a kid ispractically over, and I hate it, but that is part of growing up, accepting what you hate. I think I will do that, I have to take my final steps into adulthood, I'm not saying that I will leave all of my fun kis stuff in the rain, but I will control myself, and try to work things out in a respectable, honorable way. So, I think I know what I have to do, and I also realize that I am not the only one who needs to mature, but the only difference is that Tori has 4 more years than I do. So, I think I should withdraw myself from the race to win Tori's heart, I love her to death, and this hurts me to say, but it just couldn't work out, we are on two different levels. Although one day in the future, I am open to a relationshp with her I think I will hault for now. But remember, I said that I will stop trying to court her. I still want to be her friend and I will always love her.

      Stupid teenager movies piss me off. I mean what the fuck, and hour and a half of stupid shit. What do I get for watching that mind numbing movie? One peiece of advice, holy fucking shit, I am so glad I watched it. Not! At least I was entertained, but the real point of this post id that I finally heard something applicable to my life in a movie. What I heard was "In life the things you are most afraid of are usually the most rewarding." I figure that probably is true, I mean I am scared shitless of talking to Tori's dad today, I can envision my death (The unlikely scenario) or an hour long talk about how I should take care of his daughter andhow if I break her heart I will be destroyed. I mean, that talk is one sided and sort of boring. But the real killer about that talk would be the fact that Tori doesn't like me. Or at least I think she doesn't, ohh well, maybe one day that talk will be applicable, and I would never want to hurt her.

      Well, I just read Marie's response to all of this. I am quite greatful that she is such and understanding person. But now, I don't know what to do, I am more confused than I believe possible, I think I will retreat into the protection I call my room, for I sahll probably continue working on my book and just ignore life. I must have time to take all of this in, I need to figure things out before I continue on my journey.

      Well, the way I figure it, I'm probably going to die tomorrow...Ohh well, I can live with that. As long as Tori's parents know how I feel. Tori knows how I feel, her parents know how I feel and her brother sure as hell knows how I feel. SO, I figure it or at least I hope that they will talk to me about this tomorrow. I was going to try to talk to Marie today, but she wasn't there, so I just dropped of this letter I wrote. I guess that is a good things because I was so incredibly nervous. I thought that I was going to die of a heart attack. Well, at least the truth is known, or at least I hope it is, and what happens will happen. Just remember if I dissapear you know who did it. Ha another thing I wish Tori's parents knew is how highly I think of them, they really are like second parents to me, and I basically consider them family. I hope they learn that one day.

      Hm... as the title says, I believe that today is the day. I will finally tell Tori's mom how I feel, because it is killing me that I can't be outright about how I feel about Tori. I could never compete with "Paul", I mean, he got her a keychain that says "I love Paul". Whoopdedoo, how great, I mean, I have given her a few teddy bears, but I have written her quite a few poems, and I have expressed myself to her numerous times. But since I have to keep my love a secret I automatically lose. This sucks, I will tell her mom today, lets hope the ramifications to my actions aren't too harsh. We shall see...

      Wow, it's wednesday, it doesn't feel like it. Yay, finals today, you know what that means? No more spanish EVER, after today. Well, on another note, I wonder if I am going to see Tori today. I will call her a touch later, like after I get out of school, but her brother is working, so I can't use him as an excuse to go over and hang out. I don't know...but, let's see how today turns out, you never know. So i will get back to staring at the wall, and getting dressed.

      Wow, a productive day...School was nothing, although I am a little excited about what is going to happen later. I was invited to go to Tori's event. I hope and pray that her parents know how I feel. It had to be incredibly obvious after the play, when her mom looked back at me when Tori was doing her part. I'm happy, although I guess i have to get her a card. I have been spending so much money on her lately, how am I ever going to fix my car? Ohh well at least I get to see her smile, that makes it worth it all...well, back to work.

      Well, It is monday, but it doesn't feel like it. Today consisted of nothingness at school, then writing a 4 page essay, then I went over to Vinny's. I got to ride a motorcycle. Yay! I can do it and I killed it less than Vinny did. That is only because I drive a manual car. I tried to give Tori the short story today, byt she went to bed early in preperation for a big day tomorrow. I hope hse has fun tomorrow, too bad you'll never know what she is gunna do. And ohh yaI think I should reinforce the fact that I love her. I think marrying her someday would be cool, cool parents-in-law would be cool.

      Huh, another day at work. Helping ignorant people get online, and getting mad at stupid people. Tons of fun, at least I got here early, that was cool, I got to go over my short story and do some work for math. That worked out well...Wow, I can't still get Tori off of my mind. I love her so much, and I will give her my short story, that is a story of my love life, it is sort of boring. But it really does a good job of telling how much I love her. I think it also conveys how much I want to know how she feels. Hopefully I can get it to her without her parents seeing. Ohh well, what happens, happens, and I will love her no matter what.

      Yesterday Tori told me that I am confusing. I was just thinking about that and that is untrue, what is there to me? I want to eat when I'm hungy, sleep when I'm tired, drink when I'm thirsty and I always love Tori. She wants something all she has to do is ask, she wants me to get her something, just ask. She wants me to go away just ask. There is nothing confusing about how I feel, I love her 24/7/365 and I will do anything for her at anytime, all she has to do is ask. Some would call me whipped, I would say that I want to keep her happy, there is nothing more beautiful than to see Tori's smile, and I want to keep her, she is definately a keeper. Ont the other hand she is confusing, I don't know how she feels about me, and that confuses me, that makes all my decisions harder, I don't know how to act. Hopefully one of these days she will tell me. Well, I am going to go to school to do my spanish final. Blog ya later!

      “Hmm…what an interesting day, I once again leave my day confused. I hat it when that happens. Today started off great, I woke up brushed my teeth and got to hang out with Tori. She was babysitting, and I helped her. I had a great time. Everything she did reassured the fact that I love her. I love her so much, but I am confused. I don’t know how she feels about me, I just can’t tell, there are days like today, where she was talkative, flirty, great, and I loved it. We had a great time together. But towards the end of the day things started to go sort of downhill, she just wanted to be left alone. I can see that after a tiring day, but that just makes me wonder if she really does like me. I have to ask again, I cant figure it out. But, I don’t know, I’m sort of hanging out pooped, I left home at noon yesterday and I didn’t get home until about 7 today. So, I am lost and confused. I don’t know how she feels and that is a killer. About the only thing I can be sure of is the fact that she doesn’t love me like I love her, but maybe in time. I don’t know, I told her that I loved her, and she said “Good for you.” To which I responded “Ya, it is.” And I totally believe that, at least I know I am in love with this incredibly amazing girl, and one day I hope we could have a serious relationship. And for all the sick minded people that read this, a serious relationship doesn’t mean a lot of sex. It just means that I can hold her, hug her, kiss her, be there for her. That is all I want in life, Tori’s love, maybe it will happen one day. But at least I know someone does like me, the girl that Tori was babysitting liked me, I think it’s funny that a 2 year old likes me, but not Tori, for 2 year olds see us for who we are inside and not our physical appearance. I wish we all loved like that. Well another reason I believe that little girl liked me is because she knew my love was pure, it was obvious to her that I am in love, and that is exactly what she found comforting in me, the fact that I was in love, and my love was pure. The fact that I am in love radiates off of me, only if I could find the fact that I am in love so comforting, it would make me less uneasy and nervous, that would be nice. Ohh well, I am in love, and it is great, no matter how much it hurts day in and day out. “

      Alright, we all know the saying love hurts, and I find that that saying is true. But I love being in love, this is the most amazing feeling of my entire life, and Tori doesn't even love me back. Knowing that I am just causing myself pain by loving her, but  I can't bring myself to stop loving her does that mean I am masochistic? Emotion is so blinding to those who are older, those who have been told by society what is acceptable and what isn't. Emotion makes us  do irrational things, or so says society, but to one like the girl that Tori was babysitting emotion was a thing to embrace, and a thing that must be followed. Therefore she would be attracted to the fact that I am in love, and that my love is pure, and that has to be incredibly attractive, but only to those that follow their hearts and emotions, not those who conform to what society believes and what society sets as nominal paramiters. Damn society, if it wasn't for you I think Tori would love me right now, although I may be wrong, it is what I must believe, because without that slim hope all things in life would be meaningless. Huh, funny how I care about things like that, before, I gladly accepted death, and it didn;t bother me, but now that I am in love and I care deeply for someone, my entire outlok on life has changed and this gives my life meaning. Huh, that is some deep shit. Love has changed who I am, and how I live, for the first time I can accept settling down, and living out my life. I mean when I think of Tori I could envision us raising our kids, and living our lives together. Although that may sound sort of creepy and weird, I think that is the sign that she may be the one. Wouldn't that be ironic, the one that I believe is the one just passes me by, I don't think there is anything I can do, but ride this out. I hope this all works out in the end, at least for either Tori or me, although preferably I hope things really work out for Tori, becuase she is more important than I. Well I think I am done writing for the night, it is nice to have a creative medium such as this, sort of how Tori has drawing, and Tori if you ever read this I apologize for interrupting you during yuor drawing outside, I just needed to tell you that I love you, and those are the hardest words to say. EVER

      Too bad, it's saturday, that means Tori is babysitting, she will be gone until about 9pm...that sucks, I wanted to see her today, to hang out with her today. That is depressing, ohh well, at least I have this party to go to, maybe that will be fun. I wanted to ask Tori if she would be my date for the party...ha, that would have been cool. Ohh well, there is always tomorrow, and her dad won't be around.

That is if i see her, she has equestrian lessons and babysitting today...we shall see what happens. Love is such a confusing thing, I wish thai I understood it...

      Well, Another day another dollar. I'm at work and I can't get Tori off of my mind. I can't forget what I saw yesterday in the window. I have never seen anything that beautiful, ever. That perfect image is stuck in my mind, her beautiful face, the wind in her hair, she was indescribeably beautiful. She is so amazing, I saw a picture of her when she was young, and her mom is a good photographer, but you can't fake beauty like that. I mean, most people when they are that young are ugly little kids, but she was amazing. I couldn't believe it. I am not sure of much in life, but what I am sure of is that I love her. I love her so much, I can't wait to see her today. I'm in love, and it is great.

      *yawns* Man, I am not ready to go to school. I am really tired, but it may be worth it. Huh, today seems like one of those days where you know you are in love and your heart feels light and fluttery. I can't wait to see Tori. On the drive to the play yesterday we took the firebird as I said in my last post, and this car is a convertible. I was sitting behind Tori. I looked at the her face in the mirror and wow, you don't believe your eyes she is so beautiful. My mission this summer is to lose some weight, be more healthy for Tori. Wow, I still can't believe how incredibly beautiful she is, I mean, its mind blwing, it is incredibly hard to comprehend. I love her so much, you know, she is such an artisticaly gifted girl. She can draw, she can sing, she can write, and she can act. I wish I had that much skill, I can mix some music, and write, and I can drive. I dunno, I am rambling but I cant get Tori out of my mind. She is too  great, too wonderful, too awesome. I love her so much, I cant even begin to comprehend how much I love her.

      Ahh, today was nice. I went to Six Flags, that was fun, I went on some rides, ate a shitty burrito, and then went on this spinning thing, it was very fun. Then after that I picked up my friend and we went to go see a play that Tori was in. That was a decent play, I have to admit Tori looked so beautiful in that dress she made. That was a bomb dress, appropiate for a bomb girl. Then after a little fiasco with the '67 Firebird we got back to their house. Then I gave Tori this really cute little teddy bear, I think she really liked it. She was toting it around embracing it. I talked to her for a bit then I went home. A good day fo' sho'. It was amazing, such a good day, things are going good, and I was finally able to tell the world that I am in love. It took a few tries and a little build up of courage, but I did it and I know it is true. So I'm happy, tomorrow, I will give my car a tune up, oil change, and I will replace the distributor cap and rotor. So, I'm guna go finish my spanish final. So good night and blog ya later.

      Hmm...there seems to be no closure to today, usually I can just forget about the day and sleep. But not tonight, something worries me. I don't know, I can only pray that nothing bad happens to Tori, I would cry. I want to protect her, but I just can't do that so far away. God, I love her so much. Hopefully I can go see her and we can talk and work some things out. I need to talk to her and I need to see how she feels, she can't just give one straight answer. Hnnn...I am going to try to sleep, and if you ever read this Tori I love you.

      DAMNIT! I don't know how but a shitload of fucking viruses and spyware is now on my computer. This is bullshit, I stopped downloading porn and music and anything illegal. Shit, I don't spend much time on the internet. This sucks. I gotta go to Windows Update, and guess what I still love Tori. I still can't get her off my mind, but tomorrow. I will get to go to Six Flags. YAY! Imma go clean out some more shit, so post later

      Wow,  What a surprise, I'm at work and I'm bored. Holy shit it is amazing. After work I have to go to the bank, then off to home. I get to clean, and sit around. JOY! I hate being grounded, not seeing Tori is really hard, it is soo hard being away from her, but I btter get used to it, I dont't know why I say that, but I have a bad feeling. Like my death because her father finds out. That would suck, that would majorly suck.

      Wow, I'm at school doing nothing. Surprise, surprise. Tons of fun. I'm doing good, I really want to talk to Tori, but I know that won't happen today on account of me being grounded. But, that is fine, tomorrow I have a field trip and then after that I will go pay my ticket, take a shower and go see her. That will be more fun than a barrel of monkeys. Ohh ya...lets hope things work out. Pray for me

      Toady wasn't too bad of a day...I went to school and did nothing, then I went to work, and actually worder for 2 hours 15 min. Then I went home, cleaned my room and then went to the mall. The only problem with the mall is I went to the one that all the old people shop at, so I was SOL, but my dad needed a new shirt. Well, I didn't get to see or talk to Tori, but that is fine with me, thursday I'll go see her and learn how to ride a motorcylcle. That should be some fun shit.

      I can't stop thinking. Tori has been quite evasive of he question "Do you care about me in the same way that I care about you?" the one time she answered "yes, but there is someone else" and when her brother asks her she gives him the run around. I can understand the brother thing...But I am confused, when I am around she is hella flirty and cute and being great. Then when I ask her how she feels she gets quiet. Is it that she is scared of love become she is still young? I don't know, but hopefully one of these days I'll get an answer. Well, I am going to make the best about my current state of mind.

      This sucks, I'm grounded and I hate it. I hella want to see Tori, but that won't happen for a day or two. I really need to talk to her and see what is happening and what she is thinking. She has to be the most confusing person  ever. Why couldn't I love someone else? I need to fall in love with someone that wears their heart on their sleeve. That would be bomb.
