      Recently there were lots of discussion about the interlinking of rivers in India. Many people - politicians and scholars alike - argue that it the best way to save the drought ridden and seasonal rainfall dependent south. Though the project need details study of   environmental damages and possible relocation of tens of thousands  of people from their homes and resulting outcome, looks like it might have run into rough weather even before it's started. Recent study by British group - UK's Department of International Development (DFID) project called SAGARMATHA (Snow and glacier Aspects of Water Resources Management in the Himalayas) -  say the glacier feeding these north Indian rivers are melting and melting fast.   Some of the key finding are:  1. In the Upper Indus, the study sites show initial increases of 14 and 90 per cent in mean flows over the next few decades which will be followed by decreasing flows by 30 and 90 per cent of baseline in the subsequent decades of the 100-year scenario.  2. For Ganges, the response of the river near the glacier in Uttarkashi is different from downstream Allahabad. At Uttarkashi, flows peak at between 20 and 33 per cent baseline within the first two decades and then recede to 50 per cent of base line after 50 years.  3. Near the Brahmaputra source, there is general decrease in decadal mean flows for all temperature scenarios as glaciers are few in the area and flows recede as the permanent snow cover reduces with increasing temperature.  4. The catchment in the East Himalayas, which benefit from high precipitation of the summer monsoon every year, are less vulnerable to impacts of deglaciation than those in the West, where the monsoon is weaker.   urlLink     urlLink

       Missing Names - India Votes 2004      This election, I have seen more name missing from the voters list then any other elections before. Who is responsible, definitely the Election Commission. They are unprepared for this election. They are expecting it to be around august and got screwed up when the ruling government dissolved the parliament early - to capitalize on their recent election victories across four states. But what are the EC doing all these day. Why do they want to compile the voter list at the last moment. India is called the information technology super-power, all western and developed countries look toward India for their software services. But, Indian government departments and ministries aren't able to use the these services effectively. Every now and then they talk about e-governance in India. What kind of governance are the going to achieve if various ministries and departments aren't going to communicate among themselves and make sure the fundamental privilege of democracy - voting - is provided to all eligible voters.

       Exit polls - India Votes 2004   The exit polls of second phase of election caused a mayhem in the stock market. At least the congress will be happy - these guys were against any kind of opinion polls. Why should the market react so negatively to the news. Because, people knew little about the congress's economic policies. Even though they brought out a vision document on this,  probably, very few believed in what they say. The market feels most of the development and disinvestment program are in peril if there were to be a hung parliament. Yesterdays downfall washed Rs. 50,000cr in market cap - one of the worst in three years. At least the congress should know now, they are not welcome in a section of the society. Oh I forgot!, they want to uplift the poor - what were they doing from 1947-1997?.

      Reacting to the media report (read my blog "Whose inner voice") the office of President of India issue a press release, which I quote:  It has been reported in a section of the press that the President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had discussed the citizenship issue with Smt. Sonia Gandhi when she met him yesterday at Rashtrapati Bhavan. This is contrary to facts. It did not figure in the discussions at all.    urlLink  19-05-2004 : Rashtrapati Bhavan, New Delhi

      The following is  urlLink an article  from the "The Pioneer" newspaper. I think those genuine emotional, loyal congress leaders has some explaining to do - especially Dr. Manmohan Singh.  Did Sonia Gandhi step down from the race to be Prime Minister because her "inner voice" suddenly told her to do so? Why did this "voice" speak now, despite her being elected Congress Parliamentary Party leader and after obtaining letters of support from all allied parties?  	   	  Apparently, it was not the "inner voice" but certain queries that could have been put to her by the President of India, custodian of the Constitution, which caused her to withdraw her name.  Contrary to attempts by Congressmen and Communists to portray her eleventh-hour retreat as a "personal decision" spurred by her children, it could be the clarifications apparently sought by President A P J Abdul Kalam that resulted in the rethink. The President, it is reliably learnt, did not outrightly reject her candidature for the post of the Prime Minister. However, he is believed to have sought certain clarifications on a few points regarding the precise status of her Indian citizenship. In doing so, he may have referred to some pointed queries referred to him by legal luminaries who met him since the declaration of the Lok Sabha election results.  That probably explains why Ms Gandhi's decision to opt out came only after she emerged from the Rashtrapati Bhawan after meeting the President on Tuesday at 12.30 pm. That could also explain why she did not allow the entourage of allied parties to accompany her for the meeting, contrary to custom.  According to highly placed sources, the President may have conveyed to her that in view of the legal and constitutional queries raised, he would need some more time to examine the matter. Accordingly, there could be no swearing-in on Wednesday, May 19 - a date unilaterally announced by Left leaders and enthusiastically endorsed by Congressmen on Monday without consulting the Rashtrapati Bhawan.  Highly placed sources in the Government told The Pioneer that on the basis of various petitions submitted to him, the President could have sought to clarify a few issues from Ms Gandhi. He is said to have informally communicated to her on Monday evening that certain queries needed to be answered, even as he invited her to have a discussion on Government formation.  On the basis of pleas submitted to him by people like Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy and BJP leader Sushma Swaraj against any person of foreign origin occupying a top constitutional post, and the legal advice that he had obtained from top constitutional experts, the President could have sought three clarifications from Ms Gandhi. This would be a haunting experience for Ms Gandhi. The BJP leaders had already declared that they would continue to support any form of agitation on the foreign origin issue.  The most damaging clarification that has apparently been sought relates to Article 102 of the Constitution that says: "A person shall be disqualified for being chosen as, and for being, a member of either House of Parliament" on any or more of five possible grounds. Clause(d) of the same Article says "... or is under any acknowledgement of allegiance or adherence to a foreign state".  The term "adherence" had to be clarified specifically as Ms Gandhi in her affidavit before the Returning Officer of the Rai Bareli parliamentary constituency had stated that she owned ancestral property, namely portion of a house, in Orbassano, Italy, the country of her origin. This fact of ownership, legal experts say, makes her subject to Italian law in this matter and could be interpreted as "adherence" to a foreign country. Since this portion of the ancestral property was apparently bequeathed to her by her father in his will, she inherited it only after his death. Consequently, the property was not her's when she filed her 1999 nomination affidavit.  Article 103 states that "if any question arises as to whether a member of either House of Parliament has become subject to disqualification mentioned in Article 102, the question shall be referred for the decision to the President and his decision shall be final". Clause 2 of the Article says: "Before giving any decision on such question, the President shall obtain the opinion of the Election Commission and shall act according to such opinion."  This means that the President is required by the Constitution to undertake an elaborate process of examining the legal and constitutional issues involved. Thus, Ms Gandhi's swearing-in could not happen before the matter was fully clarified and resolved.  Another point that came in the way of Ms Gandhi was Section 5 of the Citizenship Act. Under this, there is a reciprocity provision whereby citizenship granted by India to persons of foreign origin is circumscribed by the rights that particular country confers upon foreigners seeking citizenship there.  The crux of this provision of "reciprocity" is that a person of foreign origin, who has acquired the citizenship of India through registration by virtue of marrying an Indian national, cannot enjoy more rights (like becoming Prime Minister), if the same opportunity is not available to an Indian-born citizen in that particular country.  While it is not known whether the President mentioned this, legal luminaries pointed out there could be a further lacuna over the issue of her surrendering Italian citizenship. It is believed that while acquiring citizenship through registration in 1983, she surrendered her Italian passport to the Italian Ambassador in New Delhi but did not obtain a formal notification from the Italian Government that her citizenship of that country had been cancelled.  This might be only a technicality that could be rectified in a few days, but it would have certainly helped the BJP raise the pitch of the campaign once the citizenship issue returned to the fore.  Another petition submitted to the President on Tuesday by Sushma Swaraj pointed out that as the Supreme Commander of India's Armed Forces, the President should examine a key issue. It referred to the fact that a Defence or Indian Foreign Service official cannot even marry a foreign national without permission, or must quit his post. How could a person of foreign origin be handed over the nuclear button in such circumstances, Ms Swaraj's petition demanded to know.  What could have prevented Sonia?   urlLink Article 102  of the Constitution says: "A person shall be disqualified for being chosen as, and for being, a member of either House of Parliament - (d) if he or she is under any acknowledgement of allegiance or adherence to a foreign state." Sonia Gandhi, in her affidavit, had declared she owned a house in Italy and may thus invite, the term "adherence" of the said provision.  Under  urlLink Article 103,  the President is the sole adjudicator on the issue who has to decide on such matter in consultation with the Election Commission.  Section 5 of the Citizenship Act, dealing with the reciprocity clause for a person who registered herself as an Indian citizen, says the said person could not enjoy more rights than those available to an Indian born person in that other country if he/she acquires citizenship of that country, like Italy for instance.  The clauses of the Citizenship Act were apparently not fully met when Ms Gandhi relinquished her Italian citizenship.

        In the completed general election 2004, the people of India has given clear mandate to congress president Sonia Gandhi ( Ghandi or Ghandhi?) - hype's the party. But the actual number of seats own my congress is only 147 out of 543 seats for Lok Sabha, Is this a clear mandate?, seems to be for the congress party. Moreover, it is my understanding, the congress has own at least one third (if not more) of these 147 because of its various regional allies. Definitely this is the case both in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, where people voted against the local government then for Sonia's leadership -  the congress never announced their PM before the election. This is the same in case of Bihar, Maharastra and few other states. Even the pre-poll alliance of congress, the DPA, couldn't manage to get the majority of its own. Where is the (hyped) clear mandate for Sonia's leadership. Probably the congress people have some special non-human skills - available only to those self-respectless, shameless creatures. Yes, it is a failure of democratic institution when a voter has to vote for a candidate with out knowing who is going to be their PM - who will be elected by these elected representatives. The ultimate failure is the failure to develop credible leaders among more than one billion peoples on this country.    By making Sonia Gandhi as the PM of India, the congress will ring the death-knell of Indian democratic institutions. The Party has clearly conveyed their inability to find a leader outside the Nehru-Gandhi family or from few million odd congress followers. The Party has paved way for the rise of imperialism under the banner of democracy. So what did India achieve in 60 of her independence?. In my humble opinion - apart from nuclear weapons, few missiles and a fighter aircraft - a failed democratic institutions. She failed to develop credible institutions which can created policy maker, visionaries and above all leader who will lead this country into to future. The NDA's are not different in this matter either.

       1. George Monbiot article on  urlLink The Guardian ,  urlLink  also at     US Christian fundamentalists are driving Bush's Middle East policy      In the 19th century, two immigrant preachers cobbled together a series of unrelated passages from the Bible to create what appears to be a consistent narrative: Jesus will return to Earth when certain preconditions have been met. The first of these was the establishment of a state of Israel. The next involves Israel's occupation of the rest of its "biblical lands" (most of the Middle East), and the rebuilding of the Third Temple on the site now occupied by the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa mosques.   Wait a minute, are they talking about construction of a temple in place of a mosque    The legions of the antichrist will then be deployed against Israel, and their war will lead to a final showdown in the valley of Armageddon. The Jews will either burn or convert to Christianity, and the Messiah will return to Earth.      The true believers are now seeking to bring all this about. This means staging confrontations at the old temple site (in 2000, three US Christians were deported for trying to blow up the mosques there), sponsoring Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, demanding ever more US support for Israel, and seeking to provoke a final battle with the Muslim world/Axis of Evil/United Nations/ European Union/France or whoever the legions of the antichrist turn out to be.

         Well the final phase of polling is over as of writing this blog. All parties are nervous right now, I suppose. This phase is not with out any trouble. There were reports of all kinds of problems, from booth capturing to classical missing names problem  - the later is hurting the credibility of election (particularly this one) in India. At least one person might have died in poll related violence today on the final phase of polling - which was conducted in five phases. In south chennai many voters found their names struck off from the voters list. In one case, only 15 personal from a particular residential street found their names in the list - rest what the hurry, they still have more elections to come not to mention the assembly election with in three years. Some people's group threatened to move to chennai high court on this issue - let's see what happens?.

      Recently, while reading a news group in Tamil.net, I came across an interesting theory.  The language of Sumerians was from an archaic Tamil. Many people have argued in similar lines as both the languages ( Tamil and Sumerian ) shared words and many similarities - yet to established with any certainties. Interestingly - at least to me - the theory put forth by Prof. BV Ventatakrishna Sastry of Hindu university of America, goes on to state that Rigkrit ( Sanskrit used in RigVeda I think ) branched off from the Archaic Tamil and Current Tamil is continuation of it. My efforts to accress the authors web page ended in vein - hope I get lucky in future. There seem to be at least another person  - Dr. K. Loganathan (probably from Malaysia) - working on the same theory. You can read part on research from the following link (you may need to have TSC compatible font installed to be able to view the tamil text on this page).   http://arutkural.tripod.com/sumstudies/sum-incan-1.html  One can also read their discussion on Tamil.net mailing list.  PS: I used the spelling TAMIL to be in consistent with the authors otherwise I always use the spelling THAMIZH - I think this spells proper than other one. Unfortunately everybody seem to follow the former.

      There are many expert in India who believe that Mr. PC should have gone for a vote-on-account for remaining 8 month and then presenting a budget that doesn't do anything to stimulate the economy. Not only that, it would also have given Mr. PC enough time to get his policies and priorities right. This budget had done nothing but reduce the disposable income of ordinary tax-paying and law-abiding Indian. The hike of service tax by 2% - though a smaller number in absolute terms - is going to make average Indian pay a lot more than in the past. Also, the expansion of taxable services will have its own impact. Already the oil companies are talking about raising the per liter price for petrol and diesel. Then we have this 2% education cess. Finally the average tax paying Indian end-up paying more on tax this year. This government is squeezing every bit of juice out of families who are already on a shoe tight budget.

      When I was watching a documentary on discovery channel yesterday - titled "Baby it's you" - for a moment I thought that baby is speaking Thamizh. Actually it was babbling at the picture of herself on the TV. This has led me to the hypothesis that there is a relationship between the evolution of Thamizh language and the baby's babbling. It should be noted that the baby is an European born to an European parent. Recently I came across a paper - to be published in august issue of "Behavioral and Brain Sciences" - by Dr. Dean Falk of Florida State University, attributing the evolution of language to the mother-infant gestural and vocal interactions.

        Email spoofing - the forging of another person's or company's email address to get users to trust and open a message - is one of the biggest challenges facing both the Internet community and anti-spam technologists today. Without sender authentication, verification, and traceability, email providers can never know for certain if a message is legitimate or forged and will therefore have to continually make educated guesses on behalf of their users on what to deliver, what to block, and what to quarantine, in the pursuit of the best possible user experience.   DomainKeys is a technology proposal that can bring black and white back to this decision process by giving email providers a mechanism for verifying both the domain of each email sender and the integrity of the messages sent (i.e,. that they were not altered during transit). And, once the domain can be verified, it can be compared to the domain used by the sender in the From: field of the message to detect forgeries. If it's a forgery, then it's spam or fraud, and it can be dropped without impact to the user. If it's not a forgery, then the domain is known, and a persistent reputation profile can be established for that sending domain that can be tied into anti-spam policy systems, shared between service providers, and even exposed to the user.

        Scientists working at the Russian Academy of Sciences and  urlLink  Los Alamos National Laboratory  announced today the discovery of superconductivity at ultracold temperatures in cubic diamond. The discovery offers the potential for a new generation of diamond-based device applications and even suggests that superconductivity in silicon or germanium, which also forms in the diamond structure, may be possible.   In findings published in today's issue of the scientific journal  urlLink  Nature  , the Russian - American team of scientists report their discovery of superconductivity in a boron-doped diamond-structured carbon material that had been synthesized at very high pressures and temperatures. The diamond material was fabricated in Russia by scientists working at the  urlLink Institute for High Pressure Physics (IHPP)  at the  urlLink  Russian Academy of Sciences  and brought to Los Alamos where superconductivity in diamond was discovered.    According to Vladimir Sidorov, a scientist who works at both IHPP and Los Alamos, "gem diamonds are desired for their sparkling brilliance and extreme hardness. This discovery of a totally unexpected new facet of diamond enhances its desirability, not to the well-attired, but to science and technology."   Diamonds conduct heat more effectively than copper and can withstand very high electric fields. These properties are the result of the ways in which electrons arrange themselves in the atomic structure of diamond. This same electron arrangement makes it impossible for diamond to conduct electricity. However, by subjecting a graphite and boron carbide mixture to pressures of nearly 100,000 atmospheres and temperatures of roughly 4,000 to 4,600 degrees Fahrenheit, scientists were able to transform diamonds from a 'supergem' to a superconductor that carries electricity with no resistance at a temperature of minus 450 degrees Fahrenheit.     urlLink  News Release of LANL

      A disparity between temperature trends on the earth's surface and in the troposphere, the level of the atmosphere where most weather takes place, has long fueled debate over climate change. Theoretically, if global warming is indeed happening, the troposphere should be heating up at least as fast as the earth's surface is. Yet temperature data obtained with devices called a  urlLink microwave sounding units (MSUs)  over the past 25 years have consistently suggested little if any tropospheric warming. Some climate scientists have therefore argued that global warming models are flawed. New research suggests that the error lies not in the models but rather in the temperature readings themselves.  Different MSU channels measure radiation emitted in distinct frequency ranges that correspond to different levels of the earth's atmosphere. Researchers knew that channel 2, which provides data on the troposphere, is strongly influenced by the cooling effects of the overlying stratosphere, but they had not succeeded in developing an accurate adjustment for this interference. University of Washington atmospheric scientist Qiang Fu and his colleagues used a second channel, sensitive almost exclusively to the stratosphere, to quantify this layerÂs exact contribution to channel 2 readings. After reanalyzing data collected between 1979 and 2001, the team found that the troposphere's temperature has risen by about two tenths of a degree Celsius (almost one third of a degree Fahrenheit) each decade, bringing it in line with the surface trend.     urlLink  Scientific American

      From  urlLink  PhysOrg.com    Jumping electric charges could waft breezes of ionised air through microchips, replacing the bulky and noisy fans that cool down today's computers.  Researchers at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana said that their patent-pending technology could be built directly into a computer chip's heat sink to provide a faster, quieter and lighter cooling system than existing alternatives.  In current designs, a metallic sink absorbs the heat generated by currents in the microchip and is cooled by mechanical fans. But as engineers squeeze more functionality out of smaller chips, they are finding that the fans cannot cool down the chips fast enough or are too big for the device.  "Heat is now a major factor limiting the size of laptops," said Dan Schlitz of Purdue University.  Therefore, researchers have come up with a range of alternatives, including piezo-electric fans and tiny, cold-water pumps. However, there is always a trade-off because air is preferable to water and it is does not need to be encased, but water is attractive because it absorbs and releases heat more quickly.  The Purdue technology is the first air-based system to produce a cooling rate similar to water - 40 watts per square centimeter as reported in the New Scientist.  "That is why we are excited," said Suresh Garimella, who led the research and is engaged in seven other chip-cooling projects.  The secret is producing the airflow right at the wall of the heat sink. The new system consists of 300 electrodes that ionise and then pump the air molecules across the surface.  On one side of the device are the negatively charged electrodes, bristling with long, slender carbon nanotubes to concentrate the electric field. When the voltage is switched on, electrons jump the 10 microns from the negative to positive electrodes.  This knocks electrons off the air molecules to produce a cloud of positively charged ions. While the phenomenon is similar to lightning, it occurs at much lower voltages and no actual sparks are produced.  The efficiency with which the voltage is converted into electrons is as yet unknown. But any leftover voltage will be converted into heat, which hampers the cooling effect.  "This kind of electrically driven flow traditionally has low rates of conversion," said Garimella.    "This is promising research, but there are a range of competing technologies," noted Richard Smith, who studies heat dissipation in electronic systems at the US National Science Foundation, which funded the research.    related links:   urlLink http://in.tech.yahoo.com/040325/139/2c77i.html    urlLink http://www.newscientist.com/hottopics/tech/article.jsp?id=99994816⊂=Nanotechnology    urlLink http://www.purdue.edu/

Tens of thousands of eyes, including those of SpaceShipOne designer Burt Rutan and financial backer Paul Allen, were glued to the contrail as it streaked towards the fringes of space.  Not everything went as planned. The rocket crested at around 120 metres (over the official boundary of suborbital space, but far lower than Rutan had hoped for) and strayed over 30 kilometres off course when it re-entered the atmosphere, a problem attributed to a failure in one of the flight control systems. The ship also touched down with a dent in its tail.

       urlLink from csmonitor   In the 1956 sci-fi adventure "Forbidden Planet," an American astronaut receives a "brain boost" from an alien machine that temporarily gives him enhanced mental powers. Before he dies from the effects of the boost, he helps unravel the mystery of how the civilization became extinct: It couldn't control its own immense mental powers.  More recently, the characters in "The Matrix" film series are shown "downloading" knowledge into their brains nearly instantaneously. In "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" the lead character has the uncomfortable memories of a love affair removed from his mind, with unexpected results.  What used to be confined to speculative fiction is fast becoming scientific fact. Brain boosting, or "neural enhancement," is already being done - and much more powerful techniques are on the way. Some observers say we're rushing into this brain-gain revolution without sufficient thought or preparation.  "We're about to be handed a bunch of powerful new capabilities ... to refashion ourselves, improve ourselves," notes Martha Farah, a director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Pennsylvania, in an e-mail. "We should always think through the ethical consequences of changing ourselves and our lives, for the individual and for society."  While some may worry that we'll turn ourselves into a race of Frankensteins, others look forward to new Einsteins. Optimists argue that humans are only doing what they've always been doing: trying to improve themselves, whether it's taking caffeine to stay alert or undergoing cosmetic surgery to change their appearance.  The brain-enhancement revolution is already under way. The drug Ritalin, first given to control hyperactivity in children, now is routinely used by healthy high school and college students to sharpen their thinking before taking exams. The long-term health effects are unknown.  Modafinil was developed to treat narcolepsy, a rare condition causing daytime sleepiness. But now it is used by those who simply want to be wakeful and alert, and recently seven American track and field athletes admitted to using it to boost their mental preparation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation, used for nearly two decades to treat depression, has also been found to enhance problem-solving abilities in normal individuals.  Improved brain imaging, or mapping, is yielding new techniques such as "brain fingerprinting," which purports to be able to locate memories within the brain, raising troubling possibilities for invasion of privacy. "There's nothing more private and personal than a person's memories," says Richard Glen Boire, codirector of the Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics in Davis, Calif.

        Passwords are a problem. To be secure, a password must be non-obvious and changed often. Given the number of passwords the average person uses, and given the difficulty of keeping non-obvious and constantly changing passwords straight, it's not surprising that many people don't like them.   Researchers from Hebrew University in Israel are addressing the problem with passwords that needn't be consciously remembered. The scheme taps the way people learn through the instinctive imprinting process. When a person learns information via imprinting, he can recognize the information later but can't recall it to describe it to someone else.   The system uses pictures, pseudo words or artificial grammar. In the picture version, a user sees a certificate set of 100 to 200 pictures randomly selected from a database of 20,000 pictures. Pictures are organized in groups of 2 to 9 pictures with a common theme, one of which is a certificate image. The user then practices choosing certificate images from entire theme groups.   Later, in lieu of providing a password, a user identifies most of a short series of certificate pictures. Each certificate picture is used once; the user retrains when they run low.Accuracy rates varied from 70 to 90 percent over a three-month period, and an imposter has less than 1,000th of one percent of a chance of randomly guessing correctly, according to the researchers.The method could be used practically within two years, according to the researchers. They presented the work at the Computer Human Interaction (CHI) 2004 conference in Vienna, Austria, on April 24 to 29.

      The da Vinci Project is using CFX and ANSYS ICEM CFD in their design process.   The da Vinci Project recently implemented CFX, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, to aid in the development of processes involving fluid flow, heat transfer and chemical reaction. Also added from the ANSYS software suite was ANSYS ICEM CFD, a post-processing tool to help streamline product development. ANSYS first partnered with the Canadian team in 2002, offering a broad-range of structural simulation software tools that have helped the da Vinci Project in the development of the first privately funded, reusable spacecraft. These applications are essential tools used to substantially minimize costs and improve time-to-market for designers and engineers, and are still used by the da Vinci Project today, complementing the two new ANSYS additions.  "The da Vinci team has relied on ANSYS software for over a year now, so we were thrilled to implement the CFX and ANSYS ICEM CFD products," said Brian Feeney, team leader and pilot at the da Vinci Project. "With these additions, our team is working with some of the most comprehensive and advanced simulation tools available, enabling us to build our spacecraft from design to final-stage testing and performance validation. CFX is currently helping us evaluate external aerodynamics of the vehicle at subsonic and super-sonic speeds and the internal heat transfer in the fuel tanks and storage systems. Our engineers can do this all right from their desktops -- this provides us with a major edge on the competition."    urlLink  News from da Vinci Project

      With the  urlLink  spaceship One   grounded due to technical problem and the time for the deadline for the Xprize approaching the fast,  the competition has seen the another contender coming to the forefront. The  urlLink  da Vinci Project  's "Wild Fire" is the challenger who is going to give Burt Rutan the run for the prize money of $10 million. Actually it's not about the prize money, as it is way below the amount they would have actually spent on this project, it's about achieving and winning the competition. The design race for future space transportation is as much as like the air transportation race in early 20th century.  I have some more useful links on the subject.  1.  urlLink  da Vinci Project    2.  urlLink  ANSARI XPRIZE    3.  urlLink  Starchaser: Commercial Space Access

      Off late the US department of defense is trying to lower the export limit on computers. Currently the limit limits the export of computer above Pentium 3 with 650MHz or equivalent - still in 1999, come-on guys get real. Oh I forgot, I am talking to "The US".  The dramatic tightening of export regulations is included in the National Defense Authorization Act, an annual military funding bill that has already passed the U.S. House of Representatives. Though the proposed rules are only a tiny portion of the 630-page bill, they could have a devastating impact on the computer industry. Today, computer sellers are required to get a license to export any computer with performance equal to or greater than a system with 32 Intel Itanium processors. The current version of the defense authorization act would lower that limit to systems deemed "militarily critical" by the Department of Defense. That level is currently set to the equivalent of a computer using a Pentium 3 processor running at 650MHz, state of the art in 1999 but considered feeble today.  ---------------------------------------------------- Calculated threat  Even modest systems have use in researching weapons of mass destruction; experts estimate that the current export limit of 190,000 million theoretical operations per second (MTOPS) satisfies almost all of the Department of Defense's computing needs. MTOPS	Military application	Commercial equivalent 5,000	Joint Attack Strike Aircraft design	Intel Pentium M processor, 1.5GHz 10,000	Ship's infrared search-and- track algorithm development	Intel Pentium 4 processor, 3.4GHz 15,000	Computational fluid dynamics to model extreme aircraft turbulence	AMD Dual Opteron, Model 248 20,000	Nuclear blast simulation (in conjunction with nuclear test blasts)	AMD Quad Opteron Model 842 25,000	Automatic target recognition template development	AMD Quad Opteron Model 846 50,000	3D reduced- physics simulation of nuclear weapon applications	Intel 8-way Itanium Processor 190,000	Satisfies 98 percent of Defense Dept. military computing needs	Intel 32-way Itanium Processor  Sources: Commercial numbers from Intel and AMD; military application data from Center for International Security and Cooperation report on export regulations (1998). ----------------------------------------------------  "There is no linkage between computing power and military capability any longer; in part because, if you want a bigger computer, you just have to go out and buy a few more clusters." --James Lewis, Center for Strategic and International Studies      urlLink  New.com.com

      Among the most widely used hash functions today are the so-called MD5 (for Message Digest #5). MD5 produces a hash that is 128 bits long and that is commonly written as sequence of 32 hexadecimal (base 16) digits. If you were to take my name and process it with MD5, you would get this seemingly random string:  c55bbe0f3ba258f5b1cb6d5b62b0b360  Or, to state it with more mathematical formality:  MD5(?Simson Garfinkel?)= c55bbe0f3ba258f5b1cb6d5b62b0b360  Each of those hexadecimal characters represents 4 bits; the MD5 value of my name is actually:  1100010101011011101111100000111100111011101 0001001011000111101011011000111001011011011 010101101101100010101100001011001101100000  Most people work with the hexadecimal representation because it?s pretty easy to look two hashes and tell if they are the same or different.  MD5 works by splitting the file up into lots of small pieces, and then taking each of those chunks and performing hundreds of mathematical operations that shuffle, invert, transpose, and otherwise process the bits into an unrecognizable mess. The word ?unrecognizable? in this description is key. The fundamental requirement of a good hash function is that it should be impossible to predict the fingerprint of a file without actually going to the effort of computing that fingerprint ?there must be no short-cuts. If there were, you might be able to run the hash function backwards and create a file that had a specific hash?for example, the hash of another file. Indeed, the entire security of hash functions falls apart utterly if it is possible to generate two files that have the same hash.  The beauty of the hash function is that even a tiny modification to the input produces a dramatic change in the output. Mathematically, the functions are designed so that every bit in the output will have a 50 percent chance of changing for every single bit changed in the input.  Let?s look at another MD5 hash, this one of a slightly different representation of my name:  MD5(?Simson L. Garfinkel?)= df876e8e6f548d5be698fab7f06dd278  Merely adding "L." produces a completely different hash. If you compare the two hashes bit-for-bit you?ll find that 63 out of the 128 positions have changed from a 0-to-1 or a 1-to-0, and the other 65 have remained unchanged.  Unfortunately, the whole theory of cryptographic hash functions has a huge problem. The use of these functions requires that there be no so-called "collisions". Either accidentally or on purpose, there should be no two files that have the same cryptographic fingerprint. And as it turns out, this is an impossible requirement.  The reason is pretty simple. File fingerprints are a fixed size, which means that there is a finite number of possible fingerprints. Files, on the other hand, can be any size. Thus, there are more possible files than fingerprints, and so there must be at least one fingerprint that is the fingerprint of multiple files. The mathematical term for this is the ?pigeonhole principle.? Indeed, even if you restrict yourself to files that are just nine characters long, there are still 256 times the number of possible files as the number of possible fingerprints.  The reason that the pigeonhole principle doesn?t render hash functions completely pointless is that there are an astounding number of possible fingerprints?far more, in fact, than the number of files on the planet. (With MD5 there are 2128 possible fingerprints. Now, the total number of computer hard drives that have ever been manufactured is only around 229. If every hard drive had a million unique files?a gross overestimation?there would still be only 249 individual files. That?s a much, much, much smaller number than 2128.)      urlLink  source: Technology Review

      August 6, 2004. The dream of building computer chips that use light signals rather than electricity has entered the realm of serious research in recent years with the advent of photonic crystal, a material that blocks and channels light within extremely small spaces.  Producing practical photonic crystal chips, however, includes several challenges: making three-dimensional devices that emit light from specific points, emit at the wavelengths used by today's optical telecommunications equipment and can be manufactured using processes suited to mass production.  Research teams from the MIT and from Kyoto University have made devices that meet the challenges.  The techniques could yield optical memory and quantum communications and computing devices; new types of lasers and biological and chemical sensors; smaller, more efficient communications devices; and ultimately, all-optical computer processors.  Photonic crystal contains regularly spaced gaps of air or other materials that form boundaries within the crystal that refract, or bend, specific wavelengths of light.  The MIT photonic chip has seven layers, that each contain two types of two-dimensional photonic crystal. The researchers filled specific air holes and gaps between rods during the manufacturing process to create solid areas, or defects, that emit light at 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 microns wavelengths.  The Kyoto University team has advanced its existing woodpile-structured three-dimensional photonic crystal with a method to make solid areas in specific locations that control 1.55-micron light. The Kyoto crystal includes a light source.  Devices based on the methods could become practical in five to ten years, according to the researchers. The MIT work appeared in the June 3, 2004 issue of Nature. The Kyoto work appeared in the June 3, 2004 issue of Sciencexpress.    urlLink   Technology Research News

                                      TORONTO - The da Vinci Project has notified the ANSARI X PRIZE of its intention to launch its rocket on October 2nd, marking its official entry in the international race to space competition.                                         The da Vinci Project, which unveiled its rocket Wild Fire today, joins one American team - in a field of 26 -- to announce its launch date. "With two X Prize teams launching within days of each other for the U.S. $10 million prize, we truly have a race for space," said Dr. Peter H. Diamandis, Chairman and Founder of the X PRIZE Foundation. The recipient of the $10 million (U.S.) prize will be the first team to travel safely to space twice within a two-week period on a privately-funded, re-useable spacecraft.                                         Brian Feeney, who plans to pilot Wild Fire approximately 85 kilometers into sub-orbital space, said the team is finalizing construction of the rocket as well as logistical details related to the event, which will be held in Kindersley, Saskatchewan.                                         "We_re very close to achieving our mission, thanks to the organizations and individuals that understand the significance of this race," said Feeney. "The da Vinci Project is on the cusp of a new era of space travel for humankind. Our team is proof positive that ingenuity and innovation can overcome the impossible."                                         Feeney announced a new sponsor to finance the project. Golden Palace.Com, the world_s largest online casino, has signed on as title sponsor. The Golden Palace.Com Space Program Powered By The da Vinci Project is poised to make history.                                         GoldenPalace.com is excited and very proud to be a part of the historic flight of the Wildfire. In the continuing pursuit for innovative ideas for exposure, Golden Palace feels that the Ansari X Prize competition provides the advertising exposure as well as the added incentive of a history-making event that will eventually serve to benefit all humankind.                                          The da Vinci Project, which Feeney describes as the largest volunteer technology project in Canada, has achieved several critical milestones since officially entering the competition in 1996. They include:                                         In 2003 filed necessary papers to Canadian government for launch approval; secure site for launch; tested engine components; tested design; secured a wide range of sponsors, including Sun Microsystems of Canada, Blake Cassels Graydon, ANSYS, Hinz Automation and Kindersley Transport.                                         "The da Vinci Project is emblematic of the spirit of the ANSARI X PRIZE," said Dr. Peter H. Diamandis. "It brings together many of the best and brightest to break down preconceived notions on space travel and prove that we are no longer bound to one planet."                                         Gregg Maryniak Executive Director of the Ansari X PRIZE indicated that the we are working with FAI, the international body responsible for all aviation and space world records, to ensure that the Ansari X PRIZE winner will also receive official international recognition for his achievement. In addition to duration, altitude and distance, FAI has introduced  new world record categories for "Minimum time between two consecutive sub-orbital flights in a reusable vehicle" and "Number of persons carried in sub-orbital flight".
