MONDAY 2dae is national dae! wooo!!! finally manage to get a break 2dae coz no work n oso no nid to go sch 2dae.. so shiok..... finally can slp until like pig liddat... hehe... bt was kinda sad that whn i wake up, i realise da i gt no programmes for 2dae at all.. all my frenz is either out wif family or nt free.. haiz.. den i m back to my ownself again, a loner to be exact.. pathetic lifestyle.. nvm.. i went to yishun alone to walk walk n by chance saw quite a number of NBSS student.. those bball gers, often c them ard northpoint de.. went yishun thr walk walk, had a meal den i go back hm liao...  TUESDAY 2dae is oso another a borin dae.. coz oso no work n sch 2dae.. was kinda free the whole dae n no programs, no dates at all.. poor mi....(t_t) dun rmb much wat i do on tis dae other den spendin the whole damn afternoon playin PS2.. playin sum old RPG games... guess i m realli nuts oredi...  WED was expecting to get the 'o'level chi results 2dae... bt in the end didnt... duno y.. heard frm sum of the classmate da actualli sum other sch oredi receive liao.. jux a matter the time of whether the paper arrived late or earli to the sch onli.. aniwae dun bother abt it since the conclusion is da we stil haf to wait... went hm str aft sch to change as i m workin 2dae... glad da 2dae workin place is quite near onli, at yishun.. hehe.. BTW, forget to mention, 2dae is Huimin birthdae!!! onli sum of my classmates noe her nia.. .my frenzship wif her has oso becum quite bad ever since we "ahem" last year.. bt nvm, i stil do my part as a frenz by wishin her a happy birthdae thru sms whn i off work at nite...  THURS WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I got a A1 for my chi!!! yipeeee.... was realli happi to get receive da results.. woohoo.. wanna to share my joy wif pple bt then again, i duno hu to find da can share my joy wif mi.. haiz... aniwae i oso cant do anithing much other den bein very happi for my SUPERB results lol.. sad thing is da i feel bad for nasir as he did quite badly for his malay.. receive C6 is kinda bad for him i tink... din tok much to him aft noein the results.. guess he shd be quite upset, so i oso dun wish to go troubled him... let him cool dw n relaxed.... aft sch had my eng oral, dun realli haf much confidence bt i super gurantee da i wil definitely do better in tis oral den in my midyear oral.. coz 2dae oral is much mre easier den the midyear oral i tink.. sad thing is da the invigilator din gif mi mre time to tok... the unusual gift da i said was a coinbank frm 2 girls durin one of the valentine dae.. hehe.. den the aspects whn i look for durin gifin a gift is the "Sincerity"... hehe.. bt i realize da actualli oso said the same thing as mi sia... despite mi bein the 1st person to be tested.. well...aniwae, maybe everione thinks the same way ba..  Fri the onli stuff i tink happen in sch 2dae is da kenneth was stil ponderin whether to retake the MT anot.. he at 1st dun wish to retake bt then his mother insist on him to retake it.. on the other hand, mdm lu strong advise kenneth nt to retake even to the extent of nearly bannin him to retake if she realli gt da ability.... i was sorta of a translator between him n mdm lu durin the "debate session"... bt one thing is da i tink da kenneth is realli mummy little boy lol.. he is oredi 17 yrs old oredi.. cant he realli make his own decision of whether to retake anot.. nw he shd be mature enuf n dun cum under family pressure or peer influence animre.. the fate is bein controlled in his own hands, no one can force him wat to do, or wat to said.. He shd be mre grown up abit n handle stuff himself.. jacky is oso same as him.. oso cant realli make a decision of whether to retake anot.. stil haf to ask this n that oso...  haiz.. well...aniwae, it is nt realli my problem oso.. shall nt bother too much as i dun wish to suffer another backstab or watever stuff for bein over concerning again.. it doesnt pays gd to be good.. durin eng lesson receive back my eng test paper... hehe.. was kinda glad da i was actually the highest in my class even though thr might be sum da dun realli bother abt the test.. i manage to get 33/50!! was onli abit disappointed da my marks has drop by 1mark frm the pervious comprehension... went hm aft sch... relax for a few hrs den i went to work liao le.. durin work in the afternoon, i saw shengting on the way hm.. cal her n slightly chat wif her frm far distance frm awhile.. haha.. forget to ask her abt the game da she promised to help mi find a few wks ago.. mi gt a poor memory lol...
