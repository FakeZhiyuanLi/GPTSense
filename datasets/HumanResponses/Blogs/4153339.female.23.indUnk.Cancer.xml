       Get to see Pauline today... Even though I know that there's nothing between Teck and her.. but the sight of her simply let me think of that incident.. Even though I am supposed to let the matter rest.. cos there's simply nothing during that date of them.. but... but... I really can't bring myself to forget the whole thing.. I really have to admit that I am really not that great girl friend... Teck must have been thinking that I am being very stupid and not unstanding enough after seeing my attitude after I have seen her... but, do u think I want myself to be in this way?? I simply can't find back my confidence... I seem to be such a "far low end" girl, especially after seeing her.. she's fair, she's slim, she's sweet, and she's definitely one whom Teck will like... Anyway, Teck's effort to buy the ice cream for me in 5 min definitely touched me... Thanks Teck... if u ever remember, Teck, my 1st choice for anything is always chocolate... I love u, Teck... Please forgive me for not being generous enough...

       Me and Teck were on leave yesterday, as I have a medical appointment in SGH.. Teck took his leave to accompany me.. actually Teck was on night shift the day before.. and only got off from work at about 4am++.. so touched that he is always there for me, despite how tired he was... :) Surprisingly, the whole "waiting process" to see the doctor and get my blood test quite fast! hee.. so, we proceed on with our sentosa trip! Of cos, both of us enjoyed ourselves in Sentosa. Teck got his sun tan... while I got my "sun shade"! haa.. I got to treat Teck with my 1st mth pay.. while Teck got to eat his Satay with fries.. (which he had wanted to eat it long time ago!)... not missing the mono-rail ride and of cos, swimming in the wavy sea! hee.. After a long day outdoor.. we end up in Teck's house for Teck to take a short nap.. but guess what? I oso fall asleep in the "small small bed"!! slept even longer than Teck leh! haa... That "small small bed" is really comfortable man! curdling in it makes me feel so comfortable and secured! I even told Teck that I want to sleep there next time!! hee.. :p Definitely another enjoyable day with my dearest Teck! :)

       Today Teck sense that I had something deep in my thoughts... actually, i have to admit tat during the journey from East Coast to Orchard to meet liu jie and botak.. i am really thinking abt something... tis is becos, when i heard tat botak was feeling down becos of the breakoff relationship.. i thought tat Teck would hav wanted to go and console his fren.. quickly, i gave up the thought of bladding and told Teck to go over to orchard.. but he dont seem to look very pleasant wif my idea... yah, i admit tat i really longed for tis bladding 2day... but i am really feeling fine if we go bladding nx time.. i am not angry.. in fact, i could feel tat Teck had always been wanting to give me the best... all the journey from East Coast to Orchard, the same question keeps coming to my mind.. have i been tat great to Teck? he is trying to give me the best.. but did i give him the best? does Teck feel tat i am not satisfied wif him tat he keeps trying to give me the best, where in fact, i am actually very satisfied already.. and dunno y... as i was thinking so much abt all these questions, i began to feel myself such a failure... i felt tat i am not giving as much to Teck.. he is always there giving and trying to give me the best.. and i m here.. like doing nothing much for him... i started to find myself such a hindrant to Teck.. i always cant do anything much to him whenever he is unhappy or frustrated.. in work, or in any other things.. sometimes, i even feel tat i am the one causing problems to him.. really hope tat i could do it better.. be a better gal fren of Teck...

       hee.. definitely have to write something today, cos its my 1st "visit" to blogger.. :) All thanx to my dearest Teck, who have introduce this site to me.. hmm.. next time, if i am ever angry wif him and wanna scold him.. this shall be the place to do so... can let me venge my anger, at the same time, he will also noe tat i am angry.. the best part is.. as wat i think.. it will not provoke any heated arguement between us! hee.. actually had a quite heated arguement wif Teck 2 days ago.. but luckily, we are able to calm ourselves down soon and solve the issue... couples arguing between each other is definitely a common thing.. the most important thing is tat both party needs to calm down to settle it.. so tat any misunderstanding can be resolved.. or any unhappy issues can be taken care of... we must really learn to give and take.. forgive and forget.. of cos, it is easier said than done.. nevertheless, one must never give up trying! nothing is really tat impossible if one have the determination to do it.. recently, i had come across tis phrase, which i had really feel tat it is very meaningful.. "Satisfaction is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get." it is definitely worth spending afew seconds and think over this phrase.. it might make one feel happier.. at least it is effective on me! :)
