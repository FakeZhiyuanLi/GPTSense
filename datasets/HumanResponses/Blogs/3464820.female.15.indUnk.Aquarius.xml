      I am like sooo out of it today...i called alex at like 9:30 last night, and we talked until like 2 something in the morning...five hours of my non~stop babble, i don't understand how he puts up with it...i think, if i was a guy and him, and fell madly in love with me, when he became myself as a girl, i think i would have to shoot her, him, me....yeah, i guess him being a girl being me...wait, is that suicide????..i think it might be...you know, suicide is the only crime i know of that if you attempt it, you're arrested, but if you succeed, nothing happens...slighty weird how our legal system works, but i mean really, what are they going to do, punish your dead body...strange.............but no, what really bothers me are these pissed off emo kids...i like emo, not all of it, but like new found glory and fall out boy make me happy....but these emo kids that listen to this music and then talk about how unhappy their lives are when they're like, what, 15 (??), make me sooo pissed off...what the hell do we have to be unhappy about????..."omg, susie and i broke up, i think i might kill myself"...WTF???...that is the stupidest thing i have ever heard......but, as long as i'm ranting, what bothers me even more are these same people who cut themselves for the fun of it...when i'm shaving and i miss or i fall out of a tree or soemthing,i cry, beacuse, ow, bleeding hurts...everyone in their right mind knows this....but these stupid kids are like, "yeah,i cut myself to feel the pain just to realize i'm alive"...how the fuck do you not realize you're alive...all this talk about "oh, i can't feel joy or happiness, all i can feel is sorrow and pain"...to hell with that...i say we routinely beat sense into these people...i guess pain is what they want, so i think we can make their point while we give it to them......erggggh (grinding teeth)....i don't understand what there is in life to be so unhappy about, you get in a fight with your best friend, you break up with someone you love...i've been through all of that shit and i have never once, had the wild urge to take a razor blade to my wrists to write swatstikas and fuck life on my wrist to show the world how unhappy i am...............................okay, i feel better now after venting at my computer about people who bitch wayyy more than i do about life...so, i will finsih up for today with the simple facts in life, i love alex, love makes me happy, life makes me happy, flowers, trees, the bright sky after a rainfall are all things to live for....i live for the moment and to hear the gratification in someone elses voice to know i've made a friend...and that world, and to all of you emo kids, that's what life is...friendship and love

      I have passed!!!! I am not condemned to an eternity of hell with Barbara Walters and Michael Jackson!!!  We got our confirmation test results back today, and i, miraculously might i add, have passed!!!! WOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOO....so yeah, the grandparents flew in yesterday for my confirmation at church today....we took cardinal to get there and got stuck behind the rolling thunder....it took like 45 minutes for them to all go by...it was spirtually moving and everything, but it was the looongest wait i think i've ever been in a car without going anywhere....but all 9 of us being confirmed were in the same 10 foot radius, so we all got out of our cars, (much to the stares of the passersby) and we all stood there and talked for like half an hour.....i wore a white robe (she looks so beautiful, said my mother)...(i look like i'm wearing a tree skirt, said me) they seriously did look like oversized tree skirts....sarah who is the bestest friend in all of this stupid planet we live on, volunterily came with me...why, i don't know, but i appreciate it all the same...so...going on, i had little stilettos on and i about died from my lack of oxygen from the pollen, and the fact we stood for like 45 minutes of the service........it was all a bit freaky disco....so when the service was finished, we went to famous dave's and sarah and i ordered each a rack of ribs, corn, a loaded baked potato, and cornbread muffins, i also had apples and potato salad...and (gasp) can i say it (???) sarah out-ate me!!!!!!!! oh the shame, the embaressment..out-eaten at my favorite restaurant, damn that well meant cake...arrgh..............so, after lunch we went to the mall again, that is, my mom sarah and me...i had been there the night before with my junior buds, and i absolutely fell in love with a little retro, black and white, halter top dres......so we went to go look at it...and, (gasp) the maternal linegae also loved it...she payed for it and little black and white teeny-tiny stilettos to go with it...Screeeeaaammm!!!!!!!!!...it's adorable....i have to wait five months to wear it, but, it's still double marvey with knobs....my life is content....now, off i must trot....we're having tiramaseu (spelling, i noe, i noe, i'm horrible) but however you spell it, it's super yummy....

      I cannot breathe...trees suck, all trees that produce pollen must die...we get 98% or our oxygen from algae anyway, why do we need thses stupid, leafy pollen producing trees...they fall down and catch fire, and every spring, cause me to carry an inhaler so i don't die...........when i become dictatoress of canada, all pollen producing trees will be replaced by palm trees...screw the enviornmentalist tree huggers, i do not care....i think i've already overdosed on claritin, so it's a surprise i'm not in a coma or something....cough cough....if i die tomorrow, or even later tongiht from polle, you all must use my enormous wealth (ha) to rid the world of trees.....farewell

      ok..matter is anything that has matter ans takes up space right???...and by that definition matter is anything that can nullify mass or space...so, if you have a specimen of both equal amounts of matter and antimatter, and they were combined....they would completely annihilate each other right???...that would be like +1 and -1 = 0...so....my question is...that if they equaled 0...what would be left in the blank space....it could neither be matter or it could also not be anti matter....would the rest of the world just close up around it like it had never been there....kind of like clouds coming together after lightning strikes...hmmmmmm......i don't really know, but i'm going to go ponder so i can get out of my homework.........i know this is definatelt going to keep me up tonight.......

      so...today was another contender for the strangest day of my life...alex and i have started going out...it's been like two days or something...i'm kind of nervous all of his friends will hate me because i'm annoying like woah, but after some first rate snogging, i think it'll be ok....so today after school, i had a dermatologist (sp) appointment....so alex met me at my locker and i walked out to my mom's car (the ghetto mustang is in the stupid shop...something about a fuel thing...anyway) and my mom offered to give alex a ride home...perfectly fine and normal with me...so i was like super mom...w/e....so we get in the car and my mom's like..."omg!! look at the time, i guess we'll be late for your appointment...so alex, if it's ok with your parents, you can come with us!!!"...now, keep in mind, i love my mom....i love my mom dearly....but, she is, (much like me), a moron....there is no way in hell my i've-been-going-out-with-you-for-two-days-boyfriend is going to want to come to my skin doctor!!!!...geeze mom, i'm not even that slow.....he (being the total sweetheart that he is) is like...w/e.....awwwwwww...could you totally just cover him with chocolate nad eat him???...(lol)...anyway...so we get there and of course, it takes like four million hours....arrgh....i'm allergic to like evrything on the face of this planet....poo.....so i sit in the waiting room with my mom while alex (poor baby) has fun in the reception area...too make a long story short, (i know i know, too late)...i would have killed both my mother and me...and he just sat there and smiled....awwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!...anyways...............i must be off to memorize tan outstanding literary work of robert frosts....smoochez...farewell
