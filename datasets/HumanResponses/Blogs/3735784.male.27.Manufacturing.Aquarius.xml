      There are few things in this world I truly loath. Thankfully, if only for entertainment purposes, the key word is  few . Of these few repugnances, one, I'm almost ashamed to admit, is a rather recent development. It is reality TV. Yes, yes, it's true, I have thoroughly enjoyed certain shows in the past. But lately, everytime I hear about a new reality show "in the works," I can't help but shudder and think, "Do we really need to be force fed  another  one of these things?  Another of my hostile aversions (which may or may not border on homicidal psychosis) is the dear Reverend Al Sharpton. The man clearly masturbates to the sound of his own voice and is probably one of the most insensitive, bigoted, racist fucks I've ever met.  And I live in Texas.  So when I read  urlLink this , the only thing I really want to know is: Who in Gawd's name is reponsible for this? I need to know so I can make sure and load the proper number of bullets for the shooting spree.  Although, admittedly, if  urlLink this guy  were one of the "contestants" even I would pop a bowl of popcorn and watch the damn thing...I'm thinking matra'de would be a wonderful idea for his second "career."

      Thank the Lord Geezus Christ Fucking Gawd Almighty. Occasionally lightning strikes twice and occasionally they get something  urlLink right .

      I've never understood the FDA.  Some things in this world just make sense. Some things like, oh, I don't know, providing women easy access to efficient  urlLink contraception  . A couple months ago, despite strong support and advice to make this available to the masses, the FDA  urlLink rejected  the proposal, a move that has been classified by many as  urlLink political . Something I would have to agree with. For Fuck's sake, even the  urlLink organization  that wants to give an "R"  urlLink rating  to every movie  urlLink Colin Farrell  plays in (even if it doesn't contain his  urlLink distractingly huge penis ) said  urlLink the FDA was wrong .  I even did a small amount of research that shows how much good could have come from making this drug over-the-counter (OTC). Here are the search results for the exact phrase "pregnant __ year old," with the ages ranging from 8 to 17. I wasn't motivated enough to see how many of these "hits" were bogus, but I found at least one legit story in each age group. Yes, it took till age 7 before I ran out of legit findings. Anyway, the results:  8-year-old: 43 9-year-old: 1290 10-year-old: 76 11-year-old: 205 12-year-old: 288 13-year-old: 219 14-year-old: 624 15-year-old: 638 16-year-old: 598 17-year-old: 2,220  So, as Gawd Google shows, young girls getting pregnant is already a problem. Making Plan B an OTC option is not going to cause mass teen orgies, no matter what the FDA might be suggesting. Not that I would consider mass teen orgies a national problem. I'm all about letting the kids fuck like rabbits as long as I don't have to pay for any more of their "accidents." When are we going to accept the fact that, young or old, people enjoy the fucking? We'll all be better off when we come to terms with this.  Still, never say the FDA isn't on the  urlLink cutting edge of science . Turns out those 18th century docs weren't so  primative  after all, huh? Give me a fucking break.  So, to recap. Making the prevention of unwanted pregnancies easier:  bad . Preventing  urlLink this  from happening again:  much more important .

      You're a married, smoking-hot, 23-year-old  school teacher. Seriously, at these twilight moments of your life, how else are you supposed to feel young and excited without  urlLink fucking a 14-year-old student  while having his 15-year-old cousin drive you around town in your SUV?  Where the fucking  fuck  were these teachers when  I  was this age?

      She polishes the president's polish sausage a few times, becomes famous, lands a  urlLink book  deal,  urlLink spokesman  gig and  urlLink TV  shows and still manages to  urlLink whine  about it. No wonder Bill kept plugging her face with his cock. I'd do pretty much anything to shut her up too...

      Yep. Sitting here on a Friday night, slightly perturbed.  Fuming  actually. I've made up my mind. They can have their buck an hour back (and the massive amount of grief that goes with it) and I'm cutting my hours and going back to day shift. We'll see how they like it without their crutch. Either way, I win...

      My Gawd doesn't give a shit. My Gawd allowed the most decent person I've ever known in my life to get hit by a drunk driver. Not that it killed him, no, just pinned him in. My Gawd then saw fit to allow him to live through that little ordeal long enough to burn alive before rescue personal could arrive and remove him. Did I mention my Gawd saw fit to have his pregnant wife in the car with him at the time? No? Musta slipped my mind.  My Gawd thought it would be shits and giggles to allow my mother to get cancer. Not the treatable kind for her either. It had to be deep, so deep that it wasn't spotted in time for any hope of treatment. Then it ate her away. Slowly. Painfully. For three fucking years. My Gawd was just peachy with that.  My Gawd is a real fucking hoot.  So maybe you can understand how days like today my religion can nearly get me fired. I'm a supervisor where I work and I work nights. I also happen to work a plethora of hours and not because I'm asked to, but because it is  expected  of me. Not that I'm really complaining about it, I don't mind a ton of hours and I sure as hell like the money. However, I also like to have  my  time for relaxation and fun. That is something that I'm not currently getting. See, they want me to work Friday  and  Saturday nights, which leaves me a very lively Sunday night to enjoy...please.  So when I, with the enthusiastic support of my night shift crew, go to my boss and ask for our schedule to be changed so we start our week on Sunday  night  instead of Monday you would think they'd be willing to at least discuss the issue with me. You. Would. Think. Wrong. And the reason I was given? It is against his religion to work Sundays. It is against  his  religion for  him  to work Sundays.  People who try to govern  my  life and  my  morality by what  they  believe absolutely  infuriates  me. Anyone who believes Gawd gives a shit about a work week scheduled within a calender designed by the politially motivated, highly corrupt and greed driven Vatican needs to be taken outside, flogged and nailed to a fucking stake.

        mir·a·cle  n.   1. An event that appears inexplicable by the laws of nature and so is held to be supernatural in origin or an act of God: Miracles are spontaneous, they cannot be summoned, but come of themselves (Katherine Anne Porter).  2. One that excites admiring awe. See Synonyms at wonder.  3. A miracle play.    I like kids. I really, really do. It is most likely  because  of this that I want nothing to do with spawning any of my own. I'm quite fucked up enough thank you, no need to pass that on to another human being if I have the choice. Besides, I like spoiling them and then sending them home to their parents while I get liquored up and bang naked whores bent over an arm of my couch. Or watch Star Trek marathons and beat off to Seven of Nine. A little thing I like to call Freedom of Choice.  So you'd think there wouldn't be much for me to get bent about when I read  urlLink this post . Don't' get me wrong, I really enjoy reading The Outpatient. But remember the  urlLink few things  I truly loath? Yep, this is one of them.  Most people associate a miracle with Gawd, which is reflected in the dictionary. And we all know what a huge fan I am of Gawd so that is the first thing that grates on me. It's bad enough that Gawd gets all the credit for anything remotely good that happens in life, but people,  please  quit with all the every day miracle crap. Breeding humans is no more miraculous than my ability to take a shit. If you think babies are miracles from Gawd, slip on over to  urlLink skippy's  and get a load of the fine specimens Gawd is doling out miracles to. I'd hate to worship a Gawd that careless and irresponsible.  Hell, it isn't even  awe inspiring . There isn't a living thing on this planet that doesn't have the ability to reproduce. What is so amazing that the species at the top of the food chain is able to do the same? Guess what ladies and gents? We  all  have the ability to pop out little versions of ourselves.  I could rant about this some more but I need to go take a sh--I mean, "awe inspiring miracle."

      Seriously. Weird. (Canadians aren't much better, but they're at least cool enough to let live on our continent.) First of all, it's pretty well known that Europeans have a bizarre fascination with music. Granted, a lot of it is pretty good, but we rarely become  urlLink unhealthy  about it.   Anyway, there is this  urlLink little music festival  they have every year over there (it's no Woodstock, but hey they're Europeans, what do you expect?). Admittedly, it looks pretty cool. Seems like a lot of great opportunities for  urlLink raping and molestation  but somehow they manage to get through it pretty civilly every year. So far so good, right? Here's where the European weirdness start to creep in.   Apparently, the festival is held either during a very rainy time of the year or in a very rainy region. (I didn't really care enough to do the research so feel free to elaborate.) In fact, that's part of the draw. Yep. Stand out in the poring rain, listen to music and, when the ground gets good and sloppy,  start rolling around in the mud .  Ok, not particularly normal you're thinking, but please, we have  urlLink much   urlLink weirder   urlLink stuff  here in the states. Point taken. However, it's not the festival I'm referring to. No, I'm referring to  urlLink these 47 results . Ok, I'm all about capitalism. Love it. But what the holy papal fuck!? How do these people manage to have  urlLink currency  worth nearly twice ours when they obviously have no concept of value? How do you authenticate something like that? How do you know it actually came from where they claim it came from? And do you really want to buy it from someone who went through that kind of trouble to get a hold of the merchandise in question?  Things that  urlLink make you go hmm  indeed.
