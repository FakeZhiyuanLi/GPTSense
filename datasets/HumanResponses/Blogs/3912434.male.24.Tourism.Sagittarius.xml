       Athens, Greece    Wow, I was a little worried there for a bit.     We arrived in the Athens airport this morning with no place to stay.  Our only connection for a place was with Damon's buddy that is working for NBC.  Unfortunately, he is not allowed to bring any guests into the hotel.        So there we sat -- in the airport calling hotel after hostel, trying to find a place to rest our heads.      I wasn't worried about finding a place...until I talked with Nick from Athens Hostel No. 5.  He didn't have any beds, but we could rent a spot on the roof for 25 euro.  That got me really pumped.    But finally we found a place for the next two nights!   It has a great view of the city, especially the Acropolis.  Damon is frantically searching online for Olympic tickets and we're in the process of deciding on what we will see.  Maybe women's volleyball tonight?  Wish we could go to the USA vs. Greece basketball game, but that is of course a tough one to get a ticket for.      Pictures will be posted soon -- I promise.  Sorry, but I've had a tough time finding a place to let me use a USB port.

       Berlin, Germany    It is hard to summarize the past four days in one blog entry. This is in small part because Berlin is a good city to visit, but mostly because Damon and I had such gracious hosts while staying here.    Damon met Pieter and Franziska about three years ago in Amsterdam on a random night on the town. Over the years, Damon and Pieter kept in touch through email. Although their friendship seemed quite casual, Damon emailed Pieter several weeks ago to tell him that we were coming to the German capital.    An outside observer of the weekend would have thought that Damon and Pieter were brothers, not just random drinking buddies from long ago – for two reasons. First, Pieter and Franzi were as kind and hospitable as one can be. They opened their home to us, gave us multiple tours of the city, took us shopping (I got some shoes!), and hosted us for many fine meals. They even borrowed the car of Franzi’s mom to take us to the airport this morning at 5:00 a.m. for our flight out to Athens. All in all, they made us feel like guests of honor. It was amazing. I hope to one day return the favor.    The second reason that one might think that Damon and Pieter were brothers is that they really get along great. Damon has a unique and sarcastic wit that typically comes off as lighthearted and fun. Pieter has a very similar sense of humor, so it was very interesting to see these two guys – guys that barely knew each other at the start of the weekend – feed off of each other. I think Damon had a blast with Pieter’s personality, and vice versa. Not to say that I didn’t of course. But I often found myself partnered in conversation with Franzi (in her cute Irish accent that she picked up while studying there) while Pieter and Damon told each other jokes (and Pieter taught Damon German expletives).    The unique bond that these two guys seem to share is worth a pause for reflection. In this world that seems so huge, it is truly amazing that two people from totally different backgrounds can share so much in common. It makes me wonder about the other seven billion people alive. How many other Pieters are out there that Damon hasn’t met? Or that I haven’t met? And what about you?    Of course, I must take a moment to discuss the happenings in Berlin. All in all, the city is not very spectacular looking. Berlin is a big metropolitan center that lacks the magic of many smaller European cities – Prague, for example. But for what the city lacks in scenes, it makes up in history. I found the visit to the Berlin Wall the most interesting sight. First off, it was neat to get the perspective of Pieter and Franzi – both from Eastern Germany. I knew the history a bit – learned more at the Checkpoint Charlie Museum – but was able to get a German’s view on the situation. (As an aside, this was another great advantage to having a local host: we got to discuss many issues and get a German/EU perspective. I’ll keep politics out of this blog, but will mention that it wasn’t surprising to hear/see how the EU feels about the upcoming presidential election.)    Other highlights of the trip included:    -Shopping and the best ice cream in Berlin at Potsdammer Platz, which is Berlin’s smaller version of Times Square.    -A visit to the Reichstag, which is the home of Germany’s federal government. A new glass dome was built recently and we were able to go to the top for a great view of the city. Near the Reichstag, we observed the famous Brandenburg Gate. One note: Damon and I both noticed that the landscape maintenance was sub-par. We expected the capitol to have spectacular grounds, but they were typically overgrown and shoddy.    -The Jewish National Museum had very unique architecture, including some interesting sculptures in memory of those murdered during the Holocaust. The museum was mostly about the history of German Jews, but also had a major section on the culture and traditions of Judaism. Damon and I found this part quite fascinating.    We had our final meal last night at a traditional German restaurant and it was outstanding. The portions were enormous and the food delicious. Damon and I agreed: next time we’re in Berlin, we will return to the restaurant.    And now to Athens. I’ll keep you posted on which events we’re going to so you can watch for us on TV!

       Berlin, Germany      A few years ago, I took a big road trip out to the west coast with a group of my friends from Auburn.  Along the way, we kept a quote book of funny things that people said throughout the journey.  Damon and I are not keeping a quote book, but after last night we are thinking about starting one up.  The first entry:       That looks like something off of Fear Factor.  -Damon      We were fresh off the train from Prague and after traveling by metro and foot for two hours had finally reached Damon´s friend´s house.  It was nearly 10 PM and we had not eaten all day, so we stopped at the only restaurant that seemed open.  It looked great from the outside with a relaxing patio area and festive middle eastern music.  We plopped our big packs down, ordered a German beer, and then tried to tackle the menu.      "Tried to tackle the menu" would be the key phrase from the previous sentence.  It was a bilingual menu, but unfortunately for us that meant German and Arabic.  Our waiter spoke a bit of English and so we asked him what his favorite is.  He pointed to it and we liked the price, so we ordered two.      Fifteen minutes later and still waiting on our beers, our salads arrived.  We had not eaten all day, so the salads of parsley, tomato, onion, cucumber, radish, and carrots looked delectable.  Enter the  Fear Factor  quote.  The waiter brings out our trays 0f food, and it is quickly evident to Damon that we are going to be eating liver for the rest of the night.      I have had liver before when I was a lot younger, and all I remember is that it is pretty try.  In a previous post, I mentioned that I can no longer say that I do not like beets.  Well, it is safe to say that liver can take its place.      I am sure that there are many reading this that have no problem with liver.  I respect that and even applaud that.  But on this particular evening fresh from eight hours of a journey, we were ready for something a little more appetizing.  We did not get it.  It was bitter and dry and in the end, we ate a combined 3 pieces (of the few dozen that were brought to us).      All was fine though.  We ate our salads and pita, paid the bill, and made it safely to Pieter´s house down the road.  What more could we ask for?  Okay, maybe a large pizza from Austin Pizza Live would have made it better.  But in the end, we had a roof over our head and got a great night of rest.      We have done quite a bit of touring around the city today, and are on our way to see the Checkpoint Charlie Museum.  Tomorrow we will get a tour from Pieter, which should be nice since he has lived in Berlin for many, many years.  I hope to put some pictures online soon too.  Get excited - they´re prettz good.      One more note:  I only brought a pair of flip flops over here with plans on buying a pair of hip European walking shoes upon arrival.  So I have been shopping for some shoes throughout the journey, and so far have only run across one pair of shoes in my size!  This is probably not worth mentioning on the blog, besides the fact that it is pretty funny that I remain shoeless over here solely because of my long feet!

       Prague, Czech Republic    -From Damon  That's right. Chalk up another celeb look alike for me. I have gone from Chris Odonnell to that dude from Party of Five and now to Phil Mickelson. 5 drunk Scotsmen from the bar last night pinned me with this new title. Not sure where they got the idea - trying to decide if it's the man boobs thing or the lighter hair, for sure it ain't the money. Anyways I am excited to be a pro golfer look alike - I AM PHIL MICKELSON.  So after about 20 plus miles of walking around the city yesterday (in American flops of course), we got to take a 10 minute cable car type ride up the Praha hillside - it was absolutely the most miserable experience in my life. Mind you our car sat four but 16 people were wedged in - and deodorant is just not popular around here - or windows on these things.  Pizza and beer was the dinner of choice last night, and we did dessert this time around - more beer. Stayed out late for the **first** time, walked home in the pouring rain and got late night burritos. And what a hostel we have - not one sheet of toilet paper in the place! And if you know Andy (on that level) our room doesn't really smell all that good. Praha has been fun - just like I remembered it.  So Tom Selleck and Phil Mickelson are off today to Berlin. We will be staying with my friend Pieter, whom I met my last time in Europe. Knew the guy for about 6 hours but for some reason he feels compelled to give us the use of his pad (flat) for the weekend. Pretty psyched.  Still have no place to live in Athens so please send suggestions.  Peace.

       Prague, Czech Republic    When people ask me what foods I don't like to eat, I always quickly reply with "beets."  No more, my friends.  Last night Damon and I had a traditional Czech meal -- pork, sausage, sour kraut, dumplings, Plzen beer, and of course -- beets.   Simply put, they were delightful.  (Mom, this does not mean that you need to cook beets when I return home in September.  I'd much prefer a pot of red beans on the stove.)  So you're probably wondering how Tom Selleck comes into this?  Well, since we're in Europe, Damon and I are trying to let loose and have decided not to shave.  Informally, we've decided to have a contest to see who can grow the craziest facial hair.  As many of you know, I rarely have to shave -- the only hair that I grow is around the moustache area.  And thus, Damon has started calling me "Tom Selleck" or just "Tom."   Funny that he's ribbing me for being Tom Selleck.  The kid died his hair blonde while he was in Alaska last month and is on the way to get a tattoo on his back of the Charles Bridge.  Prague -- Czech it out.  One other brief mention: we went to the National Museum yesterday.  The outside of the building was amazing so we figured it would be a cool one to hit.  We were hoping to  get some insight on the history of country and city.  Instead, all we saw was a bunch of stones and bones.  As we later read in our guidebook, this museum is only for the biggest "enthusiasts" and should be saved for only the "rainiest of days."  Justin Stickler (my archaelogist friend) would have been in heaven.  We weren't.  We leave for Berlin tomorrow at 3 PM.   Tomorrow Damon promises to post -- as soon as he dries off from all of his sweating.

       Prague, Czech Republic   Before leaving, I thought about putting a blog entry up about all of the preparation that I put into packing for this trip.  I sought advice from friends and read tips online.   I even bought a cool dry-fit towel and a super sweet REI backpack.  I packed in great detail, sealing my underroos in a zip-lock baggie and getting travel-sized toiletries (except for shampoo...I've got a lot of hair).    Turns out that was all for naught.     As I ran through the Paris airport at 6 a.m. on Monday morning, I already knew that my preciously packed bag wasn't going to be waiting for me in Prague upon arrival.   Another late flight (which should be a topic in its self) and I barely made my connection.  My luggage didn't make it. How could it?  And so I found myself waiting in the Prague airport for Damon to arrive, luggage-less and tired.  I waited and waited, and just  when I was about to give up on the kid and hop on a train to Coppenhagen (why not?) there he came around the corner.  I was never so happy to see a  Boston Red Sox hat, and I guess never so  happy to see Damon.  We  quickly found a hostel in the city centre  and took the metro into town.  After a long voyage across the Atlantic, we surprisingly  had a lot of energy and went for dinner and a few Czech beers.  The prices are up here, which we pretty much expected, but things are still cheap by US standards.   Upon our return from dinner, my luggage was there -- delivered by the Air France agent straight to my door.  So in all actuality, the delayed luggage saved me the energy of lugging it into the city!  And so we're here and the adventures begin.  Time to get to them...

       Washington, D.C., USA    As I put the finishing touches on my preparations for the trip, I'd like to address a question that many have posed to me in recent weeks: how in the world did this excursion to Eastern Europe get dreamed up?  It all goes back to the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. My roommate at UT, Damon, had worked at the '02 Games and throughout our time in Austin, he relayed many stories about his days in Utah. In sum, he had one of the best times of his life and I was quickly convinced that working at the Olympics was something that I wanted to do at some point in my life.  My graduation from UT in May 2004 and my upcoming departure to Cambridge in October 2004 left me with quite a long summer to fill my time. Knowing the summer Olympics were going to be in Athens, I decided back in the fall of 2003 to try and score a job in Greece. After a (very) little contemplation, I thought that I had the master plan: I would work for the famed USA basketball team: the "Dream Team." I went to the team Web site and browsed around looking for any type of leads regarding employment opportunities. I found none, but using my uncanny resourcefulness I ran across a page of the Dream Team executive board. I was in luck: one of the executives was from Texas.  Don't mess with Texas,  I thought to myself.  I called up the exec, explaining to his secretary that "It was Andy from Texas." Surely -- I thought -- any Texan would want to talk to another Texan. Fortunately, I was right and the secretary buzzed me through. Yet my Olypmic dreams quickly came crashing down. The bad news? The Dream Team hires their Olympic crew directly from the NBA. But the gentleman from Texas quickly bounced back the surprising good news: a "contact."  And so came my "in" into the US Olympic network. One contact led to another and before I knew it, my resume was in the hands of the US Olympic Committee PR director. Through a little paperwork, I all of the sudden had a gig working at a peasant's wages (actually a small stipend) for the USOC.  And thus the seed was planted for a little jaunt over to Athens in August. But try as I might, I could not manage to secure housing for the month for less than 8000 euros. (Yes, you did in fact read that correctly.) Wow, that's quite a sum and so I weighed my different options.  In the end, I decided to take the money that I would have spent doing the Olympics for three entire weeks and morphed the trip into an all-around Eastern European adventure. Luckily, I'll still be able to go to Athens. And even more lucky, the USOC is still going to let me work for as long as I can be there.  And my luck hasn't run out. I've got some good friends that have hopped on board for some of the fun. Damon will be with me on the first three-week leg of the journey (Prague to Vienna) and then Sarah will join for another two and a half weeks. Adam has finally committed and will be coming over for about ten days at some point in the exploration. There are a few others that are waivering (the recently married Cliff Kornegay and ping pong champ Brian Kelsey), so hopefully we can get them to come on down too. All are friends from UT so you can be sure that wherever we go, we'll be sharing the pride that got us all here in the first place.   Don't Mess with Texas.

       Washington, D.C., USA      "Life is a journey. Enjoy the ride."    I remember using this quote in high school. It comes from an old Nissan advertisement campaign. Yeah, you remember it: the one with the old man that looked like Mr. Miyagi and the little dog that looked like Spudz MacKenzie.    I used the quote in a speech at my high school graduation. I was trying to be deep. I was trying to be profound. My interpretation and application of the quote was fairly straightfoward and simple. I talked about the "road of life" -- which ironically became another Nissan ad campaign a few years later -- and how there would be ups and downs, and forks in the road that represent major decisions in life. I probably quoted Frost (although I can't be certain) and Wonka (although I can be certain). The speech most certainly included clichéd phrases like "hopefully our paths will cross again" and "this has been a journey of joy." I told colorful stories of the journey, and somehow I remember relating those stories to the phrase hakuna matata from the Lion King. How exactly -- I'm still not sure.  In the end the speech was not very memorable. It was neither deep nor profound, although I do recall receiving many approving laughs from the audience.  But I'm a changed man now, and thus I decided to revisit the quote. The change is a big one. The first time I uttered those words, I was eighteen and thought that I knew all. Now I'm twenty-four and realize that I know very little. And so I'll take my simple translation from long ago and make it even simpler.  Life literally is a journey. We -- mankind -- can make cute little analogies of what that journey is. That's what I did in my speech six years ago.   But if life is a journey, then let's make it just that: the act of traveling from one place to another throughout one's life.    Simple enough then.  Life is a journey and fortunately for me, my journey is going to include some pretty cool places over the next six weeks. From Prague to Athens to Istanbul, I'll be traversing all over Eastern Europe.  Last summer I was in Ethiopia, and many will recall the email listserve that I sent out: andysafricanadventures. All in all the emails seemed to be a hit, and I've had many friends and family members ask if I was going to set up something similar for the summer.  But in this day and age, a blog makes more sense. Now you can check up on me at anytime. No clogged inbox but still the same colorful stories from thousands of miles away. And hopefully I'll get some pictures up and running.  And so I welcome you to my blog. Just do one thing for me:  enjoy the ride.
