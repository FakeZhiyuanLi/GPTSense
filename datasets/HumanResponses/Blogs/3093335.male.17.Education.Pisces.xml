      THE COW THEORY -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 	 DEMOCRAT:  You have two cows.  Your neighbor has none. You feel guilty for being successful. You vote people into office that put a tax on your cows, forcing you to sell one to raise money to pay the tax. The people you voted for then take the tax money, buy a cow and give it to your neighbor. You feel righteous. Barbara Streisand sings for you.   SOCIALIST:  You have two cows.  Your neighbor has none. The government takes one and gives it to your neighbor. You form a cooperative to tell him how to manage his cow.   REPUBLICAN:  You have two cows.  Your neighbor has none. So?   COMMUNIST:  You have two cows.  The government seizes both and provides you with milk. You wait in line for hours to get it. It is expensive and sour.   CAPITALISM, AMERICAN STYLE:  You have two cows.  You sell one, buy a bull, and build a herd of cows.   DEMOCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE:  You have two cows.  The government taxes you to the point you have to sell both to support a man in a foreign country who has only one cow, which was a gift from your government.   BUREAUCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE:  You have two cows.  The government takes them both, shoots one, milks the other, pays you for the milk, and then pours the milk down the drain.   AMERICAN CORPORATION:  You have two cows.  You sell one, lease it back to yourself and do an IPO on the 2nd one. You force the 2 cows to produce the milk of four cows. You are surprised when one cow drops dead. You spin an announcement to the analysts stating you have downsized and are reducing expenses. Your stock goes up.   FRENCH CORPORATION:  You have two cows.  You go on strike because you want three cows. You go to lunch. Life is good.   JAPANESE CORPORATION:  You have two cows.  You redesign them so they are one-tenth the size of an ordinary cow and produce twenty times the milk. They learn to travel on unbelievably crowded trains. Most are at the top of their class at cow school.   GERMAN CORPORATION:  You have two cows.  You engineer them so they are all blond, drink lots of beer, give excellent quality milk, and run a hundred miles an hour. Unfortunately they also demand 13 weeks of vacation per year.   ITALIAN CORPORATION:  You have two cows.  You don't know where they are. While ambling around, you see a beautiful woman. You break for lunch. Life is good.   RUSSIAN CORPORATION:  You have two cows.  You count them and learn you have five cows. You have some more vodka. You count them again and learn you have 42 cows. You count them again and learn you have 12 cows. You stop counting cows and open another bottle of vodka. You produce your 10th, 5-year plan in the last 3 months. The Mafia shows up and takes over however many cows you really have.   TALIBAN CORPORATION:  You have all the cows in Afghanistan, which are two.  You don't milk them because you cannot touch any creature's private parts.   POLISH CORPORATION:  You have two bulls.  Employees are regularly maimed and killed attempting to milk them.   FLORIDA CORPORATION:  You have a black cow and a brown cow.  Everyone votes for the best looking one. Some of the people who like the brown one best, vote for the black one. Some people vote for both. Some people vote for neither.  Some people can't figure out how to vote at all. Finally, a bunch of guys from out-of-state tell you which is the best-looking one.   NEW YORK CORPORATION:  You have fifteen million cows.  You have to choose which one will be the leader of the herd, so you pick some dumb cow from Arkansas named Hillary.

      A woman is lost 	     A woman in a hot air balloon realized she was lost. She lowered altitude and spotted a man in a boat below. She shouted to him, "Excuse me, can you help me? I promised a friend I would meet him an hour ago, but I don't know where I am."   The man consulted his portable GPS and replied, "You're in a hot air balloon approximately 30 feet above a ground elevation of 2346 feet above sea level. You are 31 degrees, 14.97 minutes north latitude and 100 degrees, 49.09 minutes west longitude."   She rolled her eyes and said, "You must be a Republican." "I am," replied the man. "How did you know?" "Well," answered the balloonist, "everything you told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and I'm still lost. Frankly, you've not been much help to me."   The man smiled and responded, "You must be a Democrat." "I am," replied the balloonist. "How did you know?" "Well," said the man, "you don't know where you are or where you're going. You've risen to where you are due to a large quantity of hot air. You made a promise that you have no idea how to keep, and you expect ME to solve your problem. You're in EXACTLY the same position you were in before we met, but somehow now, it's MY fault.

      The Ant and the Grasshopper -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 	     The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed.  The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out in the cold.  MORAL OF THE STORY: Be responsible for yourself!  MODERN VERSION:  The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving.  CBS, NBC, and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food.  America is stunned by the sharp contrast.  How can this be, that in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?  Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when they sing "It's Not Easy Being Green."  Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in front of the ant's house where the news stations film the group singing "We shall overcome". Jesse then has the group kneel down to pray to God for the grasshopper's sake.  Tom Daschle & Walter Mondale exclaim in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and both call for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his "fair share".  Finally, the EEOC drafts the "Economic Equity and Anti-Grasshopper Act", retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the government.  Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare recipients.  The ant loses the case.  The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he is in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him because he doesn't maintain it.  The ant has disappeared in the snow.  The grasshopper is found dead in a drug related incident and the house, now abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the once peaceful neighborhood.  MORAL OF THE STORY: Vote Republican

      GO CONDI GO!!!  Man, that was a perfect way to stick it to the dems.  First of all lets be realistic, the dems more than the republicans are going to spin this commission to gelp John F***ing Kerry. She did what Ollie North did in the Iran-Contra "scandel".    Talk about speaking before you think.  Sen.Kerrey is really something..look at the part of the transcript of a question he asked. "KERREY: We only swatted a fly once on the 20th of August 1998. We didn't swat any flies afterwards. How the hell could he be tired?  RICE: We swatted at -- I think he felt that what the agency was doing was going after individual terrorists here and there, and that's what he meant by swatting flies. It was simply a figure of speech.  KERREY: Well, I think it's an unfortunate figure of speech because I think, especially after the attack on the Cole on the 12th of October, 2000, it would not have been swatting a fly. It would not have been -- we did not need to wait to get a strategic plan.  Dick Clarke had in his memo on the 20th of January overt military operations. He turned that memo around in 24 hours, Dr. Clarke. There were a lot of plans in place in the Clinton administration -- military plans in the Clinton administration.  In fact, since we're in the mood to declassify stuff, there was -- he included in his January 25th memo two appendices -- Appendix A: "Strategy for the elimination of the jihadist threat of Al Qaida," Appendix B: "Political military plan for Al Qaeda."  So I just -- why didn't we respond to the Cole?"  How can you blame Bush for not responding to the USS Cole incident, IF HE WASENT EVEN SWORN IN YET!!!!  Just because he has a seat above condi he belives he's better than her...yeah right.  Good job at exposing the truth Condi, and sticking it to the dems!

      NAIL IN THE FENCE    There once was a little boy who had a bad temper. His Father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, he must hammer a nail into the back of the fence. The first day the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence. Over the next few weeks, as he learned to control his anger, the number of nails hammered daily gradually dwindled down. He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails into the fence. Finally the day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at all. He told his father about it and the father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper. The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. He said, "You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one. You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won't matter how many times you say I'm sorry, the wound is still there. " A verbal wound is as bad as a physical one. Friends are very rare jewels, indeed. They make you smile and encourage you to succeed. They lend an ear, they share words of praise and they always want to open their hearts to us."

      Here are some of my views: Gore “Hey, if Al Gore doesn’t want Bush elected, maybe he should endorse him!”  Racial Profiling “The hyphen (in a name) is evil.  Al-Jazeera.  Bin-Laden.  Rodham Clinton.  Evil.  Evil, evil hyphen.”  Bush “People keep saying Bush is an idiot, and he was responsible for 9/11.  Hey, you can’t be an evil mastermind and a moron… so pick one!”  Lieberman “He might be out of the race, but at least he got some good news.  Sharper image licensed his voice to be used in one of their ambient noise sleep inducers.  He’s going to be between “Babbling Brooke” and a Norah Jones song.”   voting “Everybody’s vote shouldn’t be equal.  Idiots making decisions for the rest of us is the reason is why Bruce Almighty won ‘The People’s Choice’ award.”   On how long it’s taking to rebuild Iraq “It’s weird that it’s taking so long to rebuild Iraq.  It only took three days to destroy it!”  On the democratic debates “Watching democrats debate is like watching children put on a play.  It’s cute, but it’s never gonna make it to Broadway.”  Sharon Osbourne "She didn't know her son was a drunk?  What, was she the only person in America not watching the Osbournes?"  Sex And The City "I would rather stab myself in the eyes with a hot fork than watch five seconds of this vagicentric crap."  On Dr. Phil “Dr. Phil wrote a book one weight loss.  If you ask me, maybe he should read it.”  On Sarah Jessica Parker "I'm so tired of hearing about how beautiful she is.  With that big moose head and four pound body, she looks like a Bullwinkle the Moose PEZ dispenser."  On Fans “Fans are dangerous.  Mark David Chapman?  Fan.  John Hinkley?  Jodie Foster fan.  The girl that killed Celine Dion?  President of her fan club.  I know it was actually Selina… but a guy can hope, right?”  Stuff Magazine “It’s just like Maxim, without the bruises airbrushed out!”  On San Diego Padres new stadium “There’s gonna be a lot of improvements in the new stadium.  Nicer restaurants, more premium seating and additional handicapped parking… for the Padres.”

      Sometimes we need to remember WHAT the Rules of Life really are.    1.  Never give yourself a haircut after three alcoholic beverages of any kind.    2.  You need only two tools: WD-40 and duct tape.  If it doesn't move and it should, use the WD-40.  If it moves and it shouldn't, use the duct tape.    3.  The five most essential words for a healthy, vital relationship are "I apologize, you are right."    4..  Everyone seems normal until you get to know them.    5.  When you make a mistake, make amends immediately.  It's easier to eat crow while it's still warm.    6.  The only really good advice that your mother ever gave you was: "Go! You might meet somebody!"    7.  If he/she says that you are too good for him/her - believe them.    8..  Learn to pick your battles.  Ask yourself, "Will this matter one year from now?  How about one month?  One week?  One day?"    9.  If you woke up breathing, congratulations!  You have another chance!    10.  Living well really is the best revenge.  Being miserable because of a bad or former relationship just might mean that the other person was right about you.    11.  Work is good, but it's not that important..

      WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM? Have you ever wondered what happened to the 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence?  What kind of men were they?  Five signers were captured by the British as traitors and tortured before they died.   Twelve had their homes ransacked and burned.   Two lost their sons serving in the Revolutionary Army, another had two sons captured.   Nine of the 56 fought and died from wounds or hardships of the Revolutionary War.   They signed and they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor.   Twenty-four were lawyers and jurists. Eleven were merchants, nine were farmers and large plantation owners; men of means, well educated. But they signed the Declaration of Independence knowing full well that the penalty would be death if they were captured.   Carter Braxton of Virginia, a wealthy planter and trader, saw his ships swept from the seas by the British Navy. He sold his home and properties to pay his debts, and died in rags.   Thomas McKeam was so hounded by the British that he was forced to move his family almost constantly. He served in the Congress without pay, and his family was kept in hiding. His possessions were taken from him, and poverty was his reward.   Vandals or soldiers looted the properties of Dillery, Hall, Clymer, Walton, Gwinnett, Heyward, Ruttledge, and Middleton.   At the battle of Yorktown, Thomas Nelson, Jr., noted that the British General Cornwallis had taken over the Nelson home for his headquarters.  He quietly urged General George Washington to open fire.  The home was destroyed, and Nelson died bankrupt.   Francis Lewis had his home and properties destroyed. The enemy jailed his wife, and she died within a few months.   John Hart was driven from his wife's bedside as she was dying. Their 13 children fled for their lives. His fields and his gristmill were laid to waste. For more than a year, he lived in forests and caves, returning home to find his wife dead and his children vanished.  A few weeks later, he died from exhaustion and a broken heart.   Norris and Livingston suffered similar fates.   Such were the stories and sacrifices of the American Revolution. These were not wild-eyed, rabble-rousing ruffians.  They were soft-spoken men of means and education. They had security, but they valued liberty more.   Standing straight, and unwavering, they pledged: "For the support of this declaration, with firm reliance on the protection of the divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor."   They gave you and me a free and independent America. The history books never told you a lot about what happened in the Revolutionary War. We didn't fight just the British. We were British subjects at that time and we fought our own government!   Some of us take these liberties for granted, but we shouldn't.  So, take a few minutes and silently thank God for these, and other patriots who stand unselfishly to guarantee your freedom. It's not much to ask for the price they paid.     Remember: Freedom is never free!

      Did Bush Lie ? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 	 If you really believe that PresidentBUSH lied - - THAT THERE NEVER WERE ANY WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION IN IRAQ AND HE TOOK US TO WAR SOLELY FOR HIS OIL BUDDIES -- then read this and, if you are the fair minded person that I believe you to be ...PASS IT ON TO YOUR ENTIRE E-MAIL LIST.   Also read the last one from Sen. John F. Kerry.....   "One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them.  That is our bottom line."  - President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998   "If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear.  We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program."  - President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998   "Iraq is a long way from [the USA], but what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face."  -Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998   "He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983."  -Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998   "[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs."  -Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin,   Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998   "Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process."  -Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998   "Hussein has ... chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies."  -Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999   "There is no doubt that ... Saddam Hussein has invigorated his weapons  programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies."  - Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,)  and others, December 5, 2001   "We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a  threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the  mandated of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them."  - Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002   "We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical  weapons throughout his country."  - Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002   "Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power."  - Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002   "We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction."  - Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002   "The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are  confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and  biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons..."  -Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002   "I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force-- if necessary-- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security."  -Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002   "There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years ... We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction."  -Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002   "He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do" Rep.  - Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002   "In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members  . . . It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare,  and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons."  - Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002   "We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction."  - Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL), Dec. 8, 2002   "Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal,  murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime . He presents a  particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to  miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction  . . . So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real  . . ."  - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003   SO NOW THE SAME DEMOCRATS SAY PRESIDENT BUSH LIED, THAT THERE NEVER WERE ANY WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND HE TOOK US TO WAR FOR HIS OIL BUDDIES???  Boy! Talk about two tongued  . . . . . .

      PATRIOTS DAY  In honor of those brave Patriots who, on April 19th, 1775, at Lexington and Concord, fired the opening volley for our liberty -- and those Patriots who continue in that tradition today, shouldering the burden of American liberty, particularly those on the warfront with Jihadistan.   Concord Hymn Ralph Waldo Emerson --------------------------------------------------------------------------- By the rude bridge that arched the flood. Their flag to April's breeze unfurled, Here once the embattled farmers stood And fired the shot heard round the world. The foe long since in silence slept; Alike the conqueror silent sleeps; And Time the ruined bridge has swept Down the dark stream which seaward creeps. On this green bank, by this soft stream, We set to-day a votive stone; That memory may their deed redeem, When, like our sires, are sons are gone. Spirit, that made those heros dare To die and leave their children free, Bid Time and Nature gently spare The shaft we raise to them and thee.

      Friends, as many of you may remember, Jeremiah Denton was the senior officer in captivity in Hanoi during the Vietnam War.  When Jane Fonda was in Hanoi, Denton was scheduled to be photographed with her.  He would have none of it.  What did he do?  He beat himself, his face to a pulp, making it impossible for him to be photograhed with Hanoi Jane.  Besides the beating he gave himself, his captors continued it after Hanoi Jane left.   As usual, I welcome your comments. Teo --------------------------------------------------------------------------   Subject :  Article by Jeremiah Denton  Good article from Mobile. You might remember that Jeremiah Denton was the first POW off the plane when the POWs arrived in the U.S.  He was the first Republican elected to Congress from the State of Alabama. When he was elected to the Senate, he told the people of Alabama that he would serve only six years as their Senator. Although the overwhelming majority of the citizens of Alabama (including many Democrats) encouraged him to run for a second term, he politely declined, saying that a man's word should be his bond, even if he was a politician.    Subject: Admiral Denton's Letter to The Mobile Register    Letter to the Mobile Register By JEREMIAH DENTON Rear Admiral, US Navy Retired Former POW Served in the U.S. Senate from 1981 to 1987    Knowing that I served in the U.S. Senate with John Kerry and that, like him, I am a veteran of the Vietnam War, many people have asked me what I think of him, particularly now that he's the apparent presidential nominee of the Democratic Party.   When Kerry joined me in the Senate, I already knew about his record of defamatory remarks and behavior criticizing U.S. policy in Vietnam and the conduct of our military personnel there. I had learned in North Vietnamese prisons how much harm such statements caused. To me, his remarks and behavior amounted to giving aid and comfort to our Vietnamese and Soviet enemies. So I was not surprised when his subsequent overall voting pattern in the Senate was consistently detrimental to our national security. Considering his demonstrated popularity during the Democratic primaries, I earnestly hope the American people will soberly consider Kerry's qualifications for the presidency in light of his position and record on both our cultural war at home and on national security issues.   To put it bluntly, John Kerry exemplifies the very reasons that I switched to the Republican Party. Like the majority in his political party, he has proven by his words and actions that his list of priorities -- his ideas on what most needs to be done to improve this country -- are almost opposite to my own. Here are two issue areas that I consider top priorities: the war over the soul of America, and national security. Top priority should be placed on an effort to recover our most fundamental founding belief that our national objectives, policies and laws should reflect obedience to the will of Almighty God. Our Declaration of Independence, our national Constitution and each of the states' constitutions stress that basic American national principle. For about 200 years, the entire country, both parties and all branches of government understood that principle and tried to follow it, if imperfectly.   For some 50 years, our nation's opinion-makers, our courts and, gradually, our politicians have been abandoning our historical effort to be "one nation under God" in favor of becoming "one nation without God," with glaringly unfavorable results. I believe our political leaders, educational system, parents and opinion-makers must all return to teaching the truth most emphasized by our Founding Fathers. George Washington called religious belief indispensable to the prosperity of our democracy. William Penn said, "Men must choose to be governed by God or condemn themselves to be ruled by tyrants." And when asked what caused the Civil War, President Lincoln said, "We have forgotten God."   In these days we have not only forgotten God, we are by our new standards of government and culture rejecting him as the acknowledged creator and as the endower of our rights. As a result, we are suffering cultural decay and human unhappiness. The decline of the institution of the family is the most obvious result. Perhaps the current movie, "The Passion of the Christ," will help many to come to realize the cost of the redemption of our sins, and the destructiveness of sin. Let's remember that over 95 percent of Americans during our founding days were Christians, and though our Founding Fathers stipulated that no one was to be compelled to believe in any religion, and also stipulated that there would be no single Christian denomination installed as a national religion, there was no question that our laws were to be firmly based on the Judean Ten Commandments and on Christ's mandate to love your neighbor as you love yourself. That setup brought us amazing success as a nation, lifting us from our humble beginnings, through crisis after crisis, to become the leading nation of the world.   Now, though, we are throwing away the very source of our strength and greatness. Yet I am not giving up on our country. I am encouraged at the stand and the attitude of our president, and inspired by his courage. There are many more of his stripe in Washington now. Though Rome and other empires have decayed and fallen, the cultural war in the United States can and should be won by the majority of Americans - a majority to whom Kerry and the Democrats disdainfully refer to as the "far right." They are people who believe in God and in the original concept of "one nation under God." As a nation, we are now at the point of no return. The good guys are finally angry enough to join the fray, and I pray we are not too late. John Kerry is not among the good guys. The Democratic Party isn't either. Indeed, on the subject of national security, John Kerry epitomizes a fatal weakness in the Democratic Party.   During the decisive days of the Cold War, after the Democratic Party changed during the mid-1960s, the party was on the wrong side of every strategic debate on policy regarding Vietnam and the USSR, and is now generally on the wrong side in the war on terrorism. The truth is that the Cold War was barely won by a narrow margin - a victory and a margin determined by the political choices made by our government regarding suitable steps to deter Soviet attack and finally win the Cold War. If the U.S. had followed the Democratic Party line, the Cold War would have concluded with the U.S. having to surrender without a fight, or the U.S. would have been defeated in a nuclear war with acceptable losses to the USSR. It was not Johnson and Carter and the Democrats; it was Nixon, Reagan, George Bush and the Republicans who led us to victory in the Cold War. And George W. Bush and the Republican majority -- not John Kerry and the Democrats -- can lead us to victory in the war on terrorism.  _______________________________________________________________

      John Kerry is losing so much ground in this presidential election that he is now attacking our President personally on Good Morning America.  He has stated that he would not become involved in the National Guard controversy.    Why did he consider it necessary to bring up the National Guard when the liberal media has dropped it once GWB produced his NG records?  Because he has built his entire candidacy around the image of himself as a war hero, but when voters learn that he threw his decorations away, and then that he can't even tell a straight story about which decorations they were, the war-hero story becomes at the very least complicated.  Hence, the need for a diversionary defense.   "God, they're doing the bidding of the Republican National Committee," he said of ABC News immediately after the "Good Morning America" interview ended--and after he thought the microphone had gone off.)

      Heres something my friend has given me. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: Retired Green Beret takes on John Kerry  Open Letter to John Kerry:  My wife had rotator cuff surgery earlier this year, and the recovery is terribly painful. Then, she developed a staph-epi infection, and they had to cut the same scar open and operate on her again. Just thinking about the pain and anxiety of facing that painful surgery a second time in the same wound, makes me cringe. That experience, however pales in comparison to what I am going through right now, in my heart.  The old hurts are surfacing and the feelings of betrayal by fellow citizens, and their leader stirring them up, are breaking my heart again. I am being cut in the same scar. How did we who served in Vietnam suddenly become cold-blooded killers, torturers, and rapists, of the ilk of the Nazi SS or the Taliban?  Most of us were American soldiers who grew up idolizing John Wayne, Roy Rogers, and all the other heroes. That was why I volunteered.. But for political expediency, John Kerry has rewritten history, again. After spending only four months in the country of Vietnam, John Kerry testified before Congress in 1971 with these exact words about incidents he supposedly witnessed or heard about from other vets: "They personally raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power, cut off limbs, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians, razed villages, shot cattle and dogs for fun, poisoned food stocks, and generally ravaged the countryside of South Vietnam."  I was a green beret officer who volunteered for duty in Vietnam and fought in the thick of it in 1968 and 1969 on a Special Forces A-team on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, just for starters. We were the elite. We saw the most action. Everybody in the world knows that. But we did not just kill people, we built a church, a school, treated illnesses, passed out soap, food, and clothing, and had fun and loving interaction with the indigenous people of Vietnam, just like our boys did in Normandy, Baghdad, Saigon, and everywhere American soldiers ever served. We all gave away our candy bars and rations to kids. Our hearts to oppressed people all over the globe.  My children and grandchildren could read your words, and think those horrendous things about me, Mr. Kerry. You are a bold-faced, unprincipled liar, and a disgrace, and you have dishonored me and all my fellow Vietnam veterans. Sure, there were a couple bad-apples, but I saw none, and I saw it all, and if I did, as an army officer, it was my obligation to stop it, or at the very least report it. Why is there not a single record anywhere of you ever reporting any incidents like this or having the perpetrators arrested? The answer is simple. You are a liar. Your medals and mine are not a free pass for lifetime, Senator Kerry, to bypass character, integrity, and morality. I earn my green beret over and over daily in all aspects of my life.  Eight National Guard green berets, and other National Guard soldiers, have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and you totally dishonored their widows and families by lumping National Guard service in with being a draft-dodger, conscientious objector, and deserter, just so you can try to sabotage the patriotism of our President who proudly served as an Air National Guard jet pilot. I have a son earning his green beret at Fort Bragg right now, and his wife serves honorably in the Air National Guard, just like President Bush did, and I am as proud of her as I am my son. I volunteered for Vietnam and have no problem whatsoever with President Bush being our Commander-In-Chief. In fact, I am proud of him as our leader.  John Kerry, you personally derailed the Vietnam Human rights Bill, HR2883, in 2001, after it had passed the House by a 411 to 1 vote, and thousands of pro-American Montagnard tribespeople in Vietnam died since then who could have been saved, by you. Earlier, as Chair of the Senate Select Committee on MIA/POW Affairs, you personally quashed the efforts of any and all veterans to report sightings of living POW's, when you held those reins in Congress. You have fought tooth and nail to push for the US to normalize relations with Vietnam for years. Why, Mr. Kerry? Simple, your first cousin C. Stewart Forbes, CEO, of Colliers International, recently signed a contract with Hanoi, worth BILLIONS of dollars for Collier's International to become the exclusive real estate representative for the country of Vietnam.  "Hanoi John," now that it works for you, you beat your chest about your Vietnam service, but to me, you are a phony, opportunistic, hypocrite. You are one of those politicians that is like a fertilizer machine: all that comes out of you is horse manure, and you are  spreading it everywhere.  Medals do not make a man. Morals do.   Don Bendell   Canon City, Colorado   Don Bendell served as an officer in four Special Forces Groups, is a best-selling author with over 1,500,000 books in print, a 1995 inductee into the International Karate Hall of Fame, and owns karate schools in southern Colorado.

      Dear Mr. President;   I understand that your book is coming out in late June or early July.  The title of the book is "My Life."  Congratulations for the $10 million advance.  I understand that the initial printing will be 1.5 million books.  WOW!   Since you have a hard time remembering things, even under oath, let me remind you of a few of them.   Please mention the little pickup truck and the Astroturf in the back.  I understand that you placed it there as a gesture of pure chivalry so that the girls that you "romanced" wouldn't hurt their backs.  You even bragged about it to Don Imus on his show one time several years ago.  You may also want to link on to the following to remind yourself of your sexual history and how you have always taken advantage of women - even interns.  http://www.capitolhillblue.com/Feb1999/022599/clintonwomen022599.htm   Please tell us again of when you met Shrillary while in law school at Yale and how it was love at first sight.  And, tell about the time you threatened to beat up your step-Dad who was beating up on your mother.   I hope you tell about the fact that you were a draft dodger because you "abhorred the military."  So much did you abhor the military that you lied to the ROTC Colonel for a spot in the ROTC at Arkansas and never showed up.  But then, lying just comes naturally to you, doesn't it?  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/clinton/etc/draftletter.html   Please tell those who buy your book how you were the only president ever who had a federal indictment against him - for not reporting for the draft.  And, how, as luck would have it, before you could be arrested and taken to court, the war ended in Vietnam.  Then the worthless, inept, Jimmy Carter pardoned you along with all the other ilk - cowardly draft dodgers who fled to Canada.  I must say you were in good company - as the saying goes in Spanish, "Dime con quien te juntas y te dire quien eres."  (Tell me who you hang around with and I'll tell you who you are.)  http://www.geocities.com/cmcofer/clinton.html   The reason I'm relating these stories to you, Mr. Clinton, is because since you could not remember many details under oath, you surely can't remember these details to include them in your book.   Let me know if you need additional help in the memory category.  Like when you went to Moscow to demonstrate against the US during the Vietnam War.  The name Hanoi Bill would go fine next to Hanoi Jane and Hanoi John (Kerry).   Tell them how you became friends of the brutal communist dictators in eastern Europe  and spent time visiting them in their  home and later invited them to visit you in the White House.  In case you don't know it, Mr. Clinton, Romania and Bulgaria had the worst record of human rights of all the soviet satellites.   Oh, yes, maybe a paragraph or two about the "suicide" of Vince Foster would be nice.  I have wondered how he could have shot himself and no gun found.  And, how in the world he could have shot himself and no powder residue on his hands and his arms crossed over his body as if he were in a coffin..  http://pimall.com/nais/n.vfoster.html   And, certainly tell about the several "private investigators" that Shillary and you kept on the payroll to dig up dirt on anyone who accused you of impropriety and ethics (including rape).   Just a few memory joggers, Mr. President.   Call me if you need more help.  You can always reach me.   Sincerely,   Teo Garcia

      Texas has given all those complainers plenty of time to get used to the  results. After seeing the whiners along the inauguration route, the folks  from Texas have decided that we might just take matters into our own hands.     Here is our solution:     #1: Let Kerry become President of the United States (all 49 states).     #2: George W. Bush becomes the President of the Republic of Texas.     So what does Texas have to do to survive as a Republic?     NASA is in Houston, Texas (we will control the space industry).     We refine over 85% of the gasoline in the United States.     Defense Industry (we have over 65% of it). The term "Don't mess with Texas,"  will take on a whole new meaning     Oil - we can supply all the oil that the Republic of Texas will need for the  next 300 years. Yankee states? Sorry about that.     Natural Gas - Again we have all we need and it's too bad about those  northern states. Mr. Kerry will figure a way to keep them warm.     Computer Industry - we currently lead the nation in producing computer chips  and communications: Small places like HP, Texas Instruments, Dell Computer,  EDS, Raytheon, National Semiconductor, Motorola, Intel, AMD, Atmel, Applied  Materials, Ball Semiconductor, Dallas Semiconductor, Delphi, Nortel,  Alcatel, Etc,Etc. The list goes on and on.     Health Centers - We have the largest research centers for Cancer research,  the best burn centers and the top trauma units in the world plus other large  health planning centers.     We have enough colleges to keep us going: U.T., Texas A&M, TexasTech, Rice,  SMU, University of Houston, Baylor, UNT, Texas Women's University, etc. Ivy  grows better in the south anyway.     We have a ready supply of workers (just open the border when we need some  more )     We have control of the paper industry, plastics, insurance, etc.     In case of a foreign invasion, we have the Texas National Guard and the  Texas Air National Guard. We don't have an army but since everybody down  here has at least six rifles and a pile of ammo, we can raise an army in 24  hours if we need it. If the situation really gets bad, we can always call  Department of Public Safety and ask them to send over a couple of Texas  Rangers.  We are totally self-sufficient in beef, poultry, hogs and vegetable produce,  and everybody down here knows how to cook them so that they taste good.  Don't need any food.     This just names a few of the items that will keep the Republic of Texas in  good shape. There isn't a thing out there that we need and don't have.     Now to the rest of the United States under President Kerry : Since you won't  have the refineries to get gas for your cars, only President Kerry will be  able to drive around in his 9 mile per gallon SUV. The rest of the United  States will have to walk or ride bikes.     You won't have any TV as the space center in Houston will cut off your  communications. You won't have any natural gas to heat your homes but since  Mr. Kerry has predicted global warming, you will not need the gas.     Signed, The People in Texas

      Guilty Gore Goes Gaga "It is now clear that Al Gore is insane," writes the New York Post's John Podhoretz. "I don't mean that his policy ideas are insane, though many of them are. I mean that based on his behavior, conduct, mien and tone over the past two days, there is every reason to believe that Albert Gore Jr., desperately needs help. I think he needs medication, and I think that if he is already on medication, his doctors need to adjust it or change it entirely."  Maureen Dowd of the New York Times agrees. When he delivered a speech to the far-left outfit MoveOn.org yesterday, she writes, "Mr. Gore hollered so much, he made Howard Dean look like George Pataki." She says the erstwhile veep represents "the wackadoo wing of the Democratic Party."  Well, give Gore credit for helping liberals and conservatives find common ground in this era of polarization. Pretty much everyone agrees Gore is nuts. Well, OK, we did get one e-mail in Gore's defense, from a reader whose name we'll withhold because that's the kind of compassion we practice here at Best of the Web Today:      Al Gore spoke the truth, the real truth, and American truth. The hate speech that we are exposed to on a daily basis comes from the likes of you and the rest of you lying fascist scum that contaminate this country. You are the Republican taliban.  This charming missive pretty much captures the tone and spirit of the Gore speech, though our correspondent at least understands the virtue of brevity. Gore's speech, by contrast, ran more than 6,500 words. Maybe he's hoping for Fidel Castro's job.  How did things go so terribly wrong for Al Gore? When he ran for president in 1988, he was a fresh-faced, moderate "new Democrat." He lost the nomination to the electrifying Michael Dukakis, but he was only 40 and his future looked bright. Yet he never lived up to his potential, and today he is a pitiful, though scary, old man.  An Associated Press account of yesterday's speech notes that "Gore, who served in Vietnam, predicted greater problems for America's involvement in Iraq." The AP apparently means to suggest that Gore suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder, since the Vietnam reference is otherwise a complete non sequitur. But according to WebMD, "symptoms of PTSD usually occur within three months of the traumatic event." True, "they can occur months or years later"--but three decades later?  We've got a better theory: Gore, in our view, has cracked under a crushing burden of guilt.  To explain why, it helps to remember that a desperate anger pervades Gore's entire party at the moment. That's not surprising. For the first time in half a century, the Democrats are out of the White House and have a majority in neither house of Congress. A decisive GOP victory in November would leave the Dems a minority party for a very long time.  Oh, they put on a brave face, noting excitedly every Bush swoon in the polls. They say the president is manifestly incompetent and John Kerry will beat him easily. Maybe they'll even turn out to be right. Who knows? Certainly some Republicans are spooked about Bush's re-election prospects. But the shrillness and hysteria of the Democrats' rhetoric tells us they are far from confident.  Still, the immoderation of Gore's words, combined with the fury of his tone, puts him in a class by himself, or very nearly so, even among angry Dems. And while political candidates routinely engage in hyperbole in order to stir up the party faithful, Gore isn't running for anything. Dick Gephardt stopped ranting about Bush's being a "miserable failure" when he left the presidential race. Gore has nothing to gain by sacrificing his dignity in this way.  How did the Dems come to such a pass? In large part, it's Gore's fault. The Democrats held the White House in 2000, at a time of apparent peace and prosperity. They should have won the election that year, and they surely would have had they only had a decent candidate. But instead they had Al Gore. Even he came close enough to winning that he was tempted to try to steal the election.  There's a telling line right at the beginning of Gore's speech: George W. Bush, he says, "has brought deep dishonor to our country and built a durable reputation as the most dishonest president since Richard Nixon." Here Gore is engaging in what psychologists call "projection": attributing one's own faults to others. The most dishonest president since Richard Nixon obviously is the one who was impeached for lying under oath--the president, that is, whose No. 2 was none other than Al Gore.  Gore would have become president had Bill Clinton resigned after his 1998 impeachment, or had 17 Democratic senators voted to convict him in his impeachment trial. President Gore likely would have been re-elected in 2000, since he would have had the advantage of incumbency and been free of the Clinton taint that (unaccompanied by the Clinton charm) hurt him so much in the "red" states.  Instead, party discipline held, and the Senate acquitted Clinton. This was another missed opportunity for Gore. Had he publicly broken from Clinton and called on the president to resign, other Democrats might well have followed his lead. Instead, he appeared at a White House rally immediately after the impeachment vote and described Clinton as "a man who I believe will be regarded in the history books as one of our greatest presidents."  Thus it was Al Gore, more than anyone else, who assured the election of George W. Bush as president. And if Gore actually believes all the paranoid nonsense he utters about "global warming," "an unprecedented assault on civil liberties," the "American gulag," the "catastrophe" in Iraq and so on, he let down not only his party but his country and the world, which will soon be destroyed thanks to Bush's decision to withdraw from the Kyoto treaty.  That's more guilt than anyone should be forced to endure.

      here is something i got in a e-mail from a friend. ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Soldier's Letter to Kerry   Dear Senator Kerry:   Since it has become clear that you will probably be the Democratic nominee for President, I have spent a great deal of time researching your war record and your record as a professional politician. The reason is simple, you aspire to be the Commander in Chief who would lead my sons and their fellow soldiers in time of war. I simply wanted to know if you possess the necessary qualifications to be trusted in that respect.   You see, I belong to a family of proud U.S. veterans. I was a Captain in the Army Reserve, my father was a decorated Lieutenant in World War II; and I have four sons who have either served, or are currently serving in the military. The oldest is an Army Lieutenant still on active duty in Afghanistan after already being honored for his service in Iraq. The youngest is an E-4 with the military police. His National Guard unit just finished their second tour of active duty, including six months in Guantanamo Bay. My two other sons have served in the national guard and the navy.   In looking at your record I found myself comparing it not only to that of my father and my sons, but to the people they served with.  My father served with the 87th Chemical Mortar Battalion in Europe. They landed on Utah Beach and fought for 317 straight days including the Cherbourg Peninsula, Aachen, the Hurtgen Forest, and the Battle of the Bulge.  You earned a Silver Star in Vietnam for chasing down and finishing off a wounded and retreating enemy soldier. My father won a Bronze Star for single handedly charging and knocking out a German machine gun nest that had his men pinned down. You received three purple hearts for what appears to be three minor scratches. In fact you only missed a combined total of two days of duty for these wounds. The men of my father's unit, the 87th, had to be admonished by their commanding officer because: "It has been brought to our attention that some men are covering up wounds and refusing medical attention for fear of being evacuated and permanently separated from this organization..." It was also a common problem for seriously wounded soldiers to go AWOL from hospitals in order to rejoin their units. You used your three purple hearts to leave Vietnam early   My oldest boy came home from Iraq with numerous commendations and then proceeded to volunteer to go to Afghanistan and from there back to Iraq again.  My sons and father have never had anything but the highest regard and respect for their fellow soldiers. Yet, you came home to publicly charge your fellow fighting men with being war criminals and to urge their defeat by the enemy.  You even wrote a book that had a cover which mocked the heroism of the U.S. Marines who raised the flag on Iwo Jima.  Our current crop of soldiers has a philosophy that no one gets left behind; and they have practiced that from Somalia to the battlefields of the Middle East . Yet as chairman of a Senate committee looking into allegations that many of your fellow servicemen had been left behind as prisoners in Vietnam, you chose to defend the brutal Vietnamese regime. You even went so far as to refer to the families of the POWs and MIAs as Professional malcontents, conspiracy mongers, con artists, and dime-store Rambos.   As a Senator you voted against the 1991 Gulf War, and have repeatedly voted against funds to supply our troops with the best equipment, and against money to improve our intelligence capability I find this particularly ironic since as a Presidential candidate you are highly critical of our pre-war intelligence in Iraq. However, you did vote to authorize the President to go to war, but have since proceeded to do everything you can to undermine the efforts of our government and our troops to win . Is this what our fighting men and women can expect of you if you are their Commander in Chief? Will you gladly send them to war, only to then aid the enemy by undermining the morale of our troops and cutting off the weapons they need to win?   Our country is at war Senator, and as has been the case in every war since the American Revolution, a member of my family is serving their country during the war. Now you want me to trust you to lead my sons in this fight.   Sorry Senator, but when I compare your record to those who have fought and died for this nation, and are currently fighting and dying, the answer is not just no, but Hell No !   Sincerely,   Michael Connelly February 14, 2004 Dallas, Texas

      Are prices rising to the point where Americans are suffering great financial hardship? The most current Consumer Price Index issued by the Department of Labor reported that prices rose 0.3 percent in April, and rose 2.3 percent since April 2003. But so far in May, the TV  networks have found only one overwhelming story on the economy, the price of one single commodity: gas prices rising to "all-time highs."   From May 1 to May 26, the morning and evening news shows on ABC, CBS, and NBC have aired 50 news stories or interviews on "skyrocketing" gas prices and their impact on the economy. (Twenty-three of those stories were brief anchor-read updates.) Of that sample, 22 stories inaccurately informed viewers of "record highs" in gas prices. CBS was the Hype Channel, with 15 of the 22 "record high" errors.   While the average nominal gas price has risen above $2 a gallon, the networks routinely fail to adjust for inflation. In today's dollars, gas prices were at least 26 percent higher in March 1981 after the Carter-era inflation spiral. Gas prices today would have to reach $2.99 a gallon to be a record.   The networks were all about stoking consumer anger. On ABC's Good Morning America May 19, reporter Jake Tapper warned: "Whoever's at fault, Americans are hurting. Fifty-four percent say recent gas prices are causing financial hardship; 31 percent report serious hardship, a dramatic increase from previous gas crises." Tapper went looking for consumers to get angry at the "crisis" on camera:   -- "I'm mad. Why is it so high? I don't understand." -- "It stinks. I mean, I've never seen it this high." -- "It makes you angry because it doesn't make sense for gas to go up that fast overnight." -- "It's going to kill us. These prices are going to kill us, man."   Reporters like Tapper are too eager to exploit the concept of "hardship" to explain that it's not so scary in personal terms. If you buy 15 gallons of gas a week and it costs 50 cents more per gallon than it did a few months ago, that's a cost increase of just $7.50, which is less than the price of a movie ticket.   The networks also leave out the fact that personal incomes are rising faster than the rate of inflation. The Commerce Department reported today that disposable income, adjusted for inflation, rose 4.9 percent in the first three months of the year, more than the 4.3 percent previously estimated. The government also reported that economic growth is up 4.4 percent in the third quarter, and up five percent in the last 12 months, the fastest growth rate since 1984.   But good economic news is not big network news. When the Labor Department reported on May 7 that the unemployment rate declined to 5.6 percent, with the creation of 288,000 new jobs, it was a one-day story. The other rare bursts of economic news were gloomy.  On May 8, ABC's World News Tonight claimed it was "the worst job market for teenagers since World War II."   This very narrow focus fails to present the American people with a balanced macroeconomic picture. With the positive news shoved to the side, it's no wonder that the latest ABC-Washington Post poll found that 54 percent disapproved of President Bush's handling of the economy. Voters who want to avoid a distorted take on the economic facts ought to turn the network news off.

      After seeing the entire dedication of President Reagan, I was struck emotionally in two ways.  In profound sadness that America has lost a great hero, and the fact that the liberal establishment is tryin to destroy his record from tax cuts to him defating the evil empire.  I never met Reagan, but it wasn't necessary to have met him in order to love him, which I do, and that's as great a measure of greatness as I know. Ronald Reagan once again defines the utter beauty and blessing that is America and reminds us all of our destiny. You know, Reagan's greatness is not all about a single speech or a single phrase in a speech or a single memory. Ronald Reagan was great because he was a man. He was a great man, and he knew who he was. He was comfortable in his skin.  He was optimistic and happy. He was infectious. He dared to embrace big ideas. He dared to do big things to overcome huge obstacles in the midst of all kinds of experts telling him it couldn't be done, in the midst of all kinds of criticism, in the midst of all kinds of personal insults.  But the idea that people who routinely did everything they could to diminish Ronald Reagan in the eyes of a nation who loved him, now the fact that they do not dare come forth and be honest at this point in time about their true beliefs and feelings of Ronald Reagan, is another testament to his greatness. They don't dare, because they know the love this country has for Ronald Reagan. They know it would be suicide to practice their politics as usual during this period. Ronald Reagan was great because he never gave up on his country, and the reason he never gave up on his country, ladies and gentlemen, is because he never doubted for a moment any of us. Never doubted our wisdom. He never doubted our judgment. He never doubted our ability to do the right thing. He never doubted our ability to rise to necessary challenges. Ronald Reagan never doubted the people of this country at all. That made him a huge threat, because Reagan's enemies had no threat, no confidence and no faith in the American people. They still don't. Their view of the American people is one of incompetence, lack of judgment, inability, basic averageness -- and, of course, they must think that, for if they don't, there's no reason for them.   You know, some people forget that in the late 70s and the early 80s, the Washington establishment, which is what Reagan would later call, "The iron triangle of the liberal media, liberal special interest groups and the massive bureaucracy." Some dont know that in the late seventies and early eighties the Washington establish want was talking about of America's inevitable decline.  A decline that they said was like the Roman Empire, that we could co-exist with communism, that capitalism was going the way of the dinosaurs.  Jimmy Carter's presidency was looked at by the American left, "Well, gee, if our best and brightest can't make anything out of this, maybe there's something wrong with this." Never thought there was anything wrong with them, never thought there was anything wrong with their ideas, never thought there was anything wrong with their president, and so rather than question their own role in bringing the nation to the point it was in in 1979 and '80 -- the worst economy since the Great Depression, Soviet Union on the march throughout the world -- the elites of liberalism questioned the fortitude of the American people.    It was, after all, the establishment's failed policies and worldview that had led the nation into economic and international decline. It wasn't the people, and Reagan knew it. Jimmy Carter. After Jimmy Carter, the establishment, the elites, were questioning whether the presidency itself -- I wonder how many people remember this. The late 70s, early 80s, the Washington and New York elites were themselves questioning whether the presidency itself could survive as then structured, whether it was "a job too big for any one man." Do you remember this? Some people wondered whether the Constitution should be changed to provide for a single six-year term, rather than requiring a president to run for reelection.   Along came Ronald Reagan, and there's no doom and gloom in Ronald Reagan. He's the optimist, eternally so, shining city on a hill. He would have none of this doom and gloom. He rejected Washington elitism, and he had since 1964 and before. Talk about core values, talk about sticking to them.    He rejected Washington elitism and connected directly with the American people who adored him. He didn't need the press. He didn't need the press to spin what he was or what he said. He had the ability to connect individually with each American who saw him. That is an incredible -- I don't even want to say "talent." It's a characteristic that so few Americans have, so few people have, but he was able to do it. He brought confidence; he brought vigor, and he brought humility to the presidency, which had been missing for years, and this profoundly upset his political and media adversaries to no end, and Reagan enjoyed that. Ronald Reagan rejected socialism; he rejected big government. He insisted on returning as much government back to the people as was possible. He cut taxes so deeply that even some on his own staff became disbelievers and wrote books about it. They were wrong. He was right. Our lives today are a testament to how right Ronald Reagan was.   Reagan created the greatest economic expansion in American history, and certainly since World War II. He wasn't always successful in cutting government programs, but he tried. He slowed the growth of domestic spending by vetoing spending bills and by shutting down the federal bureaucracy. But in the end, you know, in our constitutional system, it's Congress that controls the purse strings and they made deals with him they didn't keep, but he tried. In fact, Ronald Reagan proved something that to this day economists, elite economists do not believe. Ronald Reagan lowered inflation during the midst of one of the most unbridled economies and its growth period in history. No economist thought that possible, but he did. He brought inflation down to 4.8% from its double-digit figure when he took office, and significantly, unlike Franklin Roosevelt, Roosevelt -- this is key -- Roosevelt turned to government in a failed effort to revive the American economy.   The New Deal did not revive the American economy; World War II did. The New Deal just revived government. Ronald Reagan, instead of turning to government to revive a failed American economy turned to us, the American people. He worked to unleash our ingenuity, our entrepreneurism, our enterprise and productivity. You've heard it said all weekend that Reagan "made people feel good about themselves." That's true. He made people feel good about the military. That's true he made people feel good about their country.  Those of you who can remember the campaign of 1992, when you listen to Bill and Hillary Clinton talk about the 80s as "the worst economy in the last 50 years," it was a lie. The American people were sympathetic to it because there was a small little recession occurring in 1990 and '91, into the '92 campaign, but it was nothing compared to what Ronald Reagan inherited and how Ronald Reagan fixed it.   Reagan defeated the Evil Empire no one else.  Revisonist historians may say that it was Reagans sheer "luck" that the empire fell when it did.  Now Mikhail Gorbachev (frm Soviet Leader) recently said that no one "won" the Cold War that we all lost YEAH RIGHT!!!  It's not just that he did it without firing a shot. He did it because he refused to accept it, all alone amongst those at his leadership level. So he set us out on a course to win, not "manage," the Cold War, and I consider that to be the final battle of the Second World War.   But back then, SDI (Statigic Defence Inisitive) was regarded much as the whole war in Iraq is today. SDI was treated was treated as a joke; SDI was dangerous; SDI was going to blow up the world; SDI was impossible. It was typical liberalism: greatness couldn't be done. Greatness can't happen. "This is only going to kill us all! This is just the meanderings of a B-actor." I mean, you people have forgotten how absolutely mean-spirited the critics of Reagan were about him and to him personally. He never flinched, never cared. He smiled at it. But when she stood up and went through this list of things and made the point that it was at that moment Mikhail Gorbachev realized it was over because he couldn't keep up. His country couldn't do it and he knew Americans could create SDI. You know, Reagan did not "hasten the Soviet collapse." He was responsible for it, and he was practically alone in his confidence that Soviet communism would fail, and his reason for believing it would fail was simple, and it's a reason that is eternal. He knew the Soviet Union would eventually collapse of its own immorality if pushed in the right places, so he pushed.      You know, there was one debate in the 1980 presidential campaign, one debate, very near the election, and the Carter people thought that they were going to clean the clock of Ronald Reagan. They thought Reagan was a dunce and an idiot, and we all know what happened. You talk about deer-in-the-headlight eyes, that was Jimmy Carter in that whole debate. Ronald Reagan debated Bobby Kennedy in the 1960's. You will not believe the story of this. I forget what the subject matter was, but the Kennedy people couldn't wait for this. You know, Reagan was ascending after his Goldwater speech in '64, and the Kennedy crowd thought, "We're going to wipe the stage with this guy. This guy is nothing," the typical way that liberals look at conservatives, and particularly conservative leaders. When it was over, Bobby Kennedy called Pierre Salinger in Paris and said, "Don't you ever put me with this guy again. It's impossible." Reagan was real. He just connected one on one with everybody. He had no ego. None. He was totally comfortable with who he was. He liked who he was, and he liked everybody else.   As I said, Reagan's entire presidency became known as the "decade of greed" by Democrats who today claim to praise and venerate him. In fact, after the 1984 presidental election, in California,  the Democrats, (Former California Democrat Senator) Alan Cranston was running around all over the state trying to tell old people that Reagan's reelection would cause them to lose their homes and their health care. Ever heard of that? Does that sound familiar? Twenty years ago. David Broder, I'm pretty sure, his first column in the Washington Post after Reagan's reelection called it :a triumph of greed and selfishness over citizenship,: meaning the 49-state landslide was from people who wanted theirs, who wanted their tax cut and to hell with the poor and disadvantaged and what have you. I think Broder also wrote -- Reagan was 69 when he was first took office -- Broder wrote, "He's too old to be in touch with anything." I haven't seen what Broder has said this weekend, but he was just an example.   They were all saying things like this because they hated Ronald Reagan, and don't let anybody tell you differently. They feared him, which was the reason for their hate. They could not outflank him. They couldn't relate to people as he could -- and they were the people who "had the common touch," they told us. They were the people who had the ability to understand what life was like for the average guy, and here's Ronald Reagan running circles around them. Of course they didn't like him. He posed a great threat. Reagan was accused of sexism; he was accused of racism; he was accused of heartlessness. They said he was responsible for homelessness and AIDS. They said he was going to start World War III and destroy the social safety net, including Social Security, the school lunch program. Sound familiar? See how left never changes? But Reagan was none of those things and did none of those things. He was wiser, he was smarter, and bigger than his detractors.   I never met him. Wasn't necessary. It was not necessary to have met Ronald Reagan in order to love him as I do, and that is as good a measure of greatness which does not need to be explained as I know. I will predict that the starting this Sunday (13-June04) the liberal establishment is going to start with this revisonist history bull shit, but it wont get me angery.  I know what President Reagan stood for, and if it werent for him, there will still be a country named the Soviet Union, so God bless Ronald Reagan, and as he never failed to say, God bless America.

      In memory of the greatest president this nation has ever had, here is a quote from him that should guide us in the future.  "If children prayed together, would they not understand what they have in common, and would this not, indeed, bring them closer, and is this not to be desired? So, I submit to you that those who claim to be fighting for tolerance on this issue may not be tolerant at all. When John Kennedy was running for President in 1960, he said that his church would not dictate his Presidency any more than he would speak for his church. Just so, and proper. But John Kennedy was speaking in an America in which the role of religion -- and by that I mean the role of all churches -- was secure. Abortion was not a political issue. Prayer was not a political issue. The right of church schools to operate was not a political issue. And it was broadly acknowledged that religious leaders had a right and a duty to speak out on the issues of the day. They held a place of respect, and a politician who spoke to or of them with a lack of respect would not long survive in the political arena. It was acknowledged then that religion held a special place, occupied a special territory in the hearts of the citizenry. The climate has changed greatly since then. And since it has, it logically follows that religion needs defenders against those who care only for the interests of the state. ... The churches of America do not exist by the grace of the state; the churches of America are not mere citizens of the state. The churches of America exist apart; they have their own vantage point, their own authority. Religion is its own realm; it makes its own claims. We establish no religion in this country, nor will we ever. We command no worship. We mandate no belief. But we poison our society when we remove its theological underpinnings. We court corruption when we leave it bereft of belief. All are free to believe or not believe; all are free to practice a faith or not. But those who believe must be free to speak of and act on their belief, to apply moral teaching to public questions. I submit to you that the tolerant society is open to and encouraging of all religions. And this does not weaken us; it strengthens us. ... You know, if we look back through history to all those great civilizations, those great nations that rose up to even world dominance and then deteriorated, declined, and fell, we find they all had one thing in common. One of the significant forerunners of their fall was their turning away from their God. ... Without God, there is no virtue, because there's no prompting of the conscience. Without God, we're mired in the material, that flat world that tells us only what the senses perceive. Without God, there is a coarsening of the society. And without God, democracy will not and cannot long endure. If we ever forget that we're one nation under God, then we will be a nation gone under." --Prayer Breakfast, 1984

      sorry i havent kept up with my blog.........been lazy, but who can you blame..IT SUMMER BREAK!!!!! As we celebrate our Independence Day, now is a good time to repost this exchange between Senator John Glenn and the leftist, communist-loving Senator Howard Metzenbaum.   Teo   Some people still don't understand why military personnel do what they do for a living. This exchange Between Senators John Glenn and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum is worth reading. Not only is it a pretty impressive and impromptu speech, but it's also a good example of one man's explanation of why men and women in the Armed Services do what they do for a living. This IS a typical, though sad, example of what some who have never served think of the Military.   --------------------------------- Senator Metzenbaum to Senator Glenn: "How can you run for Senate when you've never held a "real job?" Senator Glenn: "I served 23 years in the United States Marine Corps.I served through two wars. I flew 149 missions. My plane was hit by antiaircraft fire on 12 different occasions. I was in the Space Program. It wasn't my checkbook, Howard; it was my Life on the line. It was not a nine to five job, where I took time off totake the daily cash receipts to the bank. I ask you to go with me ... as I went the other day... to a Veterans Hospital and look those men - with their mangled bodies - in the eye, and tell THEM they didn't hold a job! You go with me to the Space Program at NASA and go, as I have gone, to the widows and orphans of Ed White, Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee...and you look those kids in the eye and tell them that their DADS didn't hold a job. You go with me on Memorial Day and you stand in Arlington National Cemetery, where I have more friends buried than I'd like to remember, and you watch those waving flags. You stand there, and you think about this Nation, and you tell ME that those people didn't have a job? I'll tell you, Howard Metzenbaum, you should be on your knees every day of your life thanking God that there were some men - SOME MEN - who held a REAL job. And they required a dedication to a purpose - and a love of country and a dedication to duty - that was more important than life itself. And their self-sacrifice is what made this country possible.   I HAVE held a job, Howard! ---What about you?"  For those who don't remember - During WWII, Howard Metzenbaum   was an attorney representing the Communist Party in the USA. Now he is a Senator!   If you can read this, thank a teacher.... If you are reading it in English, thank a Veteran.......
