      Okay, here's the paragraph that's running at the top of Drudge's page right now (as of 11:43 EST):  "The Kerry campaign calls on a publisher to 'withdraw book' written by group of veterans, claiming veterans are lying about Kerry's service in Vietnam and operating as a front organization for Bush. Kerry campaign has told Salon.com that the publisher of UNFIT FOR COMMAND is 'retailing a hoax'... 'No publisher should want to be selling books with proven falsehoods in them,' Kerry campaign spokesman Chad Clanton tells the online mag... Developing... "  And then, just below that, in big block letters "  Kerry Campaign Calls for Book Ban.  "  Now, go read the paragraph again. Is he calling for the baning of the book? Well, you can read the article  urlLink here  (yeah, I know you have to watch an ad to view the article, but it takes about 15 seconds tops). According to the article, the Kerry spokesman the says the publisher "should consider" withdrawing the book. He doesn't call on the publisher to do so. Of course, that's not nearly as sexy sounding as Drudge's misleading headline, but hey, that's the liberal media for you.   UPDATE:  There is now (as of 3:50pm EST) no reference at all to this story.

      Here's a little primer on just how bad the Bush Administration wants to  urlLink screw working people , courtesy of the  urlLink AFL-CIO .  Why anyone in their right mind believes he's for regular people is beyond me.

      The big knock on Kerry from Democrats has been his near-silence regarding some of the more shrill and vicious critics on the right. I understand the desire to not stoop to their level, it doesn't look very Presidential to get into a verbal food fight with some wing nut who thinks you're a pawn of the Rothschild family. But finally, FINALLY, he's fighting back against the attacks on his military service. Story  urlLink here . What makes me laugh is that some of these guys are telling stories that, if true, should result in them giving back THEIR OWN medals from incidents in which Kerry got his. Plus, while the Swifty group claims that they alone are responsible for the ads (right, I'm sure this is all coming out of their military pensions), the people financing them have been longtime Bush contributors. I really think this group is doing more long-term damage to Bush/Cheney than they are to Kerry. This is going to backfire on Bush bigtime. And boy does he deserve it.

      ...but I'm sure it would just be the coke talking.  The experts agree,  urlLink Jesus would vote for Kerry .  (Thanks to  urlLink Drew Curtis  for the link)

      Tom Tomorrow's  urlLink website  gets a lot more traffic than mine (duh), which means he gets a better class of nut job emails than I do too.   urlLink This one's  a classic.  At least he said "Thank you" at the end.

      Rolling Stone has a pretty good article on Bill O'Reilly  urlLink here . I've worked with this guy when he filled in at WRKO in Boston, and I'm still amazed that people are willing to give this cheap hack so much credibility after all these years. The guy just reeks of a former high school nerd who now has the power to bully everyone else. He's getting payback from the world for the way he was pushed around growing up. I'm surprised he doesn't have a locker on his set to shove people into.

      The  urlLink Washington Post  (suscription required) has a pretty good look into just how scripted and fake these Q&amp;A sessions with the President really are. Plus, they're creating an opportunity for Bush to give voice to the smears that the Swift Boat jackasses are putting out there without actually saying these things himself. Check it out:   "Q On behalf of Vietnam veterans -- and I served six tours over there -- we do support the President. I only have one concern, and that's on the Purple Heart, and that is, is that there are over 200,000 Vietnam vets that died from Agent Orange and were never -- no Purple Heart has ever been awarded to a Vietnam veteran because of Agent Orange because it's never been changed in the regulations. Yet, we've got a candidate for President out here with two self-inflicted scratches, and I take that as an insult. (Applause.) "THE PRESIDENT: Well, I appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you for your service. Six tours? Whew. That's a lot of tours. "Let's see, who've we got here? You got a question?"

      Or is the Bush/Cheney campaign just  urlLink shithouse crazy ?  Okay, I honestly don't know if this is the work of Jeb Bush on behalf of his brother's reelection bid, but come ON!  An investigation no one will comment on that's targeting older black people who just so happen to work as voter registration volunteers?  Are any of the major newsmedia even trying to find out what's going on?  I mean, we know that they only gave a cursory glance to the fact that thousands of eligible voters were stricken from the rolls illegally last time around.  Can it possible be just a coincidence that all this is taking place in Florida?  The mind boggles.

      So what does it say when the President's nominee for CIA cheif is trying to  urlLink legalize  the kind of things Nixon did?  Remember this is the guy that the White House insists is the most qualified person for the job, and he's on record earlier this year as saying he's not qualified to work at the CIA nowadays.

      I know this is tiptoeing into global conspiracy territory, but is anyone else besides me just a little bit uncomfortable about all the  urlLink GPS devices  being so readily available?  Not to mention OnStar?  The thought that anyone might be able to track my every movement and possibly even control my vehicle from outside if they wanted to just kinda creeps me out.  I'm sure it's made some people's lives easier, but it's still a little too Big Brother-ish, for me.  On an unrelated note: A few people have started to email me and give me feedback on this 'blog, which is nice.  But what would be nicer (and not that I don't appreciate the support) is if you'd post a comment at the bottom of the post that interested you.  That would go a long was towards making it seem like I'm not just talking to myself here.  Thanks.

      For some reason, there are links to conservative 'blogs and writers at the top of this page.  I have no idea why this is.  It's fine, I guess.  This is a free 'blog service, so I guess they get to choose what they link from my page.  I just think it's kind of strange.  Just thought I'd mention it.

      Yet again, Bush  urlLink declines an opportunity  to yank the leash on the Swiftboat attack ads. But of course, why should he? His friends in Texas paid damn good money for them. What really confuses me is why McCain continues to work for him.  I really want to like McCain (he is, after all, the Democrats favorite Republican), but to go back and shill for a guy who so blatantly smeared him last time around?  For all the posturing from the right on how strong they are on military, etc., it's amazing that they don't seem to like actual  soldiers  very much.

      Well, maybe not really, but I still think he had the best set on Tuesday's finals.  Honestly, I think this season, with all of the attendant squabbles about whether or not it was fixed, was pretty good, even better than last year.  It does seem like the folks in the cattle calls got hosed.  At the very least, the producers cherry-picked the final 10 from the prearranged "private" auditions, not from all the folks who froze in the street waiting for their three minutes of stagetime.  In a way, I'm almost glad Gary didn't win.  I've worked with him and hung out with him in Boston, and I think he was certainly good enough to win the whole thing.  But his manager, Barry Katz, is also the Executive Producer of the show, and I'd hate to see all the snarky comments about how he only won because of his manager.  Gary's a good guy and a damn fine comic.  At any rate, congrats to  urlLink John Heffron .

      Plenty of other places are covering  urlLink this story , but no one's really ever answered the question: If, as I understand it, these are basically the same drugs that are available in the US, only cheaper, then why is the Federal Government so hot to make people pay more?  Why doesn't the FDA just admit that they are a wholly-owned subsidiary of the pharmaceutical industry?  The other irony about all of this is that, while Republican politicians (and quite a few Democrats too) get large amounts of money from big drug companies, Conservative pundits are always the ones who bemoan the culture that encourages so many people to take all these drugs.  And they call US the flip-floppers.

      Boy, the  urlLink Vatican  really knows how to create some good will, don't they?  Following this to it's logical conclusion, I think the next step would be to air Pay-per-view where each member of the College of Cardianls gets to slap a crippled child in the face.

      Okay, here we go. The test post apparently worked, so now I start posting in ernest. Welcome to my new 'blog. I used to have (actually I still have) another 'blog-like site that you can still read here: urlLink http://comedyjc.diaryland.com/ . As you can see from that page, I'm a real stickler for timely, thought-provoking updates. This will be a combination of personal observation and political commentary, salted with what I hope will be sharp, pointed comedy. The reason I say hope is that, even after several years of traveling the professional stand-up comedy circuit, some things are still only funny to me. Something you'll notice as you read my posts is that I'm rather left-leaning. What does that mean? Well, it certainly doesn't mean what talk radio would like you to believe it means. One thing that's always bugged me about conservative commentators and their respective adoring publics is that they've decided to frame the national debate based on what THEY say people like me believe, and then try to force us to defend it. Unfortunately, a lot of the time, we take the bait. The one thing I can promise you about this board is that you'll know I believe something WHEN I TELL YOU I DO. Nevermind what Rush and Hannity and O'Reilly tell you. When I say something, that's when you know. I also promise to call bullshit when I see it from my own party. I'm more than willing to admit that there are folks on the left that can be just as hyper and shrill as some of those on the opposite side, and I'm sick of people trying to make me defend them too. So there you go, about as much of a manifesto as I could muster at this point. I'll prolly change my mind more than once, but it's my damn 'blog, so I can do what I want. I can't imagine I'm talking to anyone but myself right now, but if you're reading this, I hope you enjoy it
