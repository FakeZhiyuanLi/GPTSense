        When I saw Sum 41 open for gob in Hamilton a few months ago, I was impressed with their live performance. Although the music wasn't anything new, they played with a lot of energy and dead on precision. A few weeks later, I was shocked to learn that they had been signed to a major label.

       Sum41 has outdone themselves. After years of being compared to bands like New Found Glory and Blink 182, they managed to do something impressive. Surpass them. The Canadian born punks, who show a heavy metal influence, have gone from sounding like metal influenced pop punk to sounding like pop punk influenced metal. Incredible drums, ripping guitars and straight up fun songs. They aren’t out to make any points this time. Their last album was full hallow ‘fuck you’ anthems, and as great as FAT LIP on their last album, it lacked substance. This time, their not out to prove that. They’re out to prove that their brand of punk isn’t out, and that they can still rock hard. This the fastest, hardest, and most serious release of theirs to date, and blows away all previous conceptions. Also included in the package is a free DVD, where the band makes a mockumentary about the fake 80’s metal band Pain for Pleasure. It also has outtakes from their latest video, which are hilarious, as they mock bands like ‘Blink 182’, ‘Sr-71’ and ‘Green Day-73’. Makes me wonder how they ever narrowed down which segments to use. Al in all, the record which the rest of their careers will be judged by. Good luck. This will be a tough one to top.

        The album begins with 'Nothing on My Back', which doesn't sound too original or inspiring. I immediately think of The Jam and most Nu-metal bands around today crossed with the beastie boys. Most of the early tracks including 'Fat Lip' have the tried and trusted formula of the slow bit followed by the body surfing bit.

       I never had any chance to say something at all because she yanked me to the Physics laboratory immediately after she saw what happened and, as I expected, her two best friends are there, too, to support her in making this situation worse for me than I can ever imagine: Leah, my former teacher in General Science, spoke first looking at me with this acid glare that slowly burns my face so it looked very red,  is this what you're learning from this school? ... and when I didn't answer those evil teachers just huddled together and nodded in agreement, I imagined they've just reached a verdict which was so unbelievably unfair because I never said anything to defend my side yet, so thinking that I should say something before these Gorgons sentence me, I said  it was a metaphor...  but I should have known better, I mean, they rised from their small meeting and looking at me like their waiting for me to say more but instead Miriam, the old Chemistry teacher, approached me slowly, her butt swaying as she walked, and told me  You are in no position...  I can't quote everything she said but you can imagine that these teachers are grilling me like meat, anyway Eloi, the research teacher, told me I won't be recieving my Certificate of Good Moral ( Goddamit!   They really doesn't get it do they?,  I told myself, by doing this they're just proving my so-called 'slander' true) and that I will also be kicked out from The Isotopes (that's  our  schoolpaper, if you don't know), but that's where they crossed the line, they can do to me whatever they want but they can't kick me out of my only outlet of releasing inner angst... but since they\re my teachers (stupid hypocrites, though they are) I couldn't do anything but accept their decree, talk about power struggles,anyhow I walked away from what was unmistakably their maniacal laughter.

         And then there she is A figure steadfast against the crowds down the street Dominant as summer daylight        Her body is the paragon of health, perfectly fashioned like a Greek sculpture with contours bending to her will.        And skin, pale like December’s moonlight, blending constantly with shadows from the trees overhead.        With her hair, an infinite midnight waterfall, slowly dancing with the breeze as she ambled leisurely on the avenue.        And her face, sweetly sinister as it steals away the essence of beauty itself        With eyes, shrouded in mist though still revealing a hazel stare that murders me.        And lips, pursed quietly, hesitantly killing the roses behind which already pales in contest.        And now there she goes, The god of my idolatry Mocking Cleopatra’s beauty The silent muse of inspiring fantasy.

        I've never seen the place at night before. It looks haunted. I moved closer to the altar. The statue of the person in the cross gazed into the darkness without blinking, even once.
