       What the hell does that mean? I feel like I cannot gather all the pieces I am made of in one solid person that would thus be "real me". As if I could either suffer into my deepest flesh or forget it all and become cold to the one I love. What the hell am I doing? My God, she is the greatest love of my short life and I feel like my heart is shutting down to make this feeling choke. Feels like my heart is only searching for any rebounce possible, making me look for an unseazable, mysterious man that I see once a month, by chance. And every day I dress up and make up to be at my best if I see him, knowing well that this is a total chimera. I am pasting all my dreams on his handsome face and imagining he is exactly the one I want for a lover, that is the one I could talk and have sex with, without involving too much of my feelings because I am still bright enough to know that I am not able to love anyone else for the moment. But I know I need an affair. I need something happen to me. And I chose the married guy. If it is a man I want, why not choose one of the many waiters in the neighbourhood? Half of them would be glad to go out with me for a while, I know that. But this is not the point. The point is, I need to change the way things have always been going on in my life. If I want him, if it is my decision, then I should stop dreaming and begin acting. God damn it. I have felt something so strong and strange in him since the first time I have seen him. I remember I thought, he is the most handsome man I have ever seen. I was so moved by his face, his hands and his gestures. But afterwards I would forget all about it until I would see him again, one month later. Now it has become some kind of an obsession. My heart tells me: nothing is done, nothing is written; there is a place for dreaming and hoping there. But everytime I have had that kind of feeling before it has ended the same way: nothing happened. I remained silent and cold and invisible, frightened at the idea of being ridiculous. I will make things change; I will say what I mean and feel and am. And the hell with his wife! Whatever happens, a husband seldom leaves his wife. But that makes things even more complicated for me. Because I would be glad to have a coffee with him. I am especially curious to know how far he stands from what I imagine he is. But my heart is too romantic and enthusiastic. (Yes, that is true my love, if you ever read these lines. But I am so afraid of hurting people that it keeps me from doing anything.) And my heart is presently playing copy-paste. If I must really be honest with myself, I only want that handsome man to be a masculine version of my love, and a version I could handle that time. The same story, without my mistakes. The same story, without the sorrow. The same story, without the engagement (sure he is married elsewhere - and me too). And with an end that would not drop me dead. O my God I feel so stupid and blind.

              Alma Mahler    ____________________     L'amour est un oiseau rebelle que nul ne peut apprivoiser  Et c'est bien en vain qu'on l'appelle s'il lui convient de refuser  Rien n'y fait, menace ou prière, l'un parle bien, l'autre se tait  Et c'est l'autre que je préfère, il n'a rien dit, mais il me plaît   L'amour est enfant de Bohème; il n'a jamais connu de loi  Si tu ne m'aimes pas je t'aime; si je t'aime prends garde à toi!  Si tu ne m'aimes pas, si tu ne m'aimes pas je t'aime  Mais si je t'aime, si je t'aime, prends garde à toi!   L'oiseau que tu croyais surprendre battit de l'aile et s'envola  L'amour est loin, tu peux l'attendre : tu ne l'attends pas, il est là  Tout autour de toi, vite vite il vient, s'en va, puis il revient  Tu crois le tenir, il t'évite, tu crois l'éviter, il te tient!   L'amour est enfant de Bohème; il n'a jamais connu de loi  Si tu ne m'aimes pas je t'aime; si je t'aime prends garde à toi!  Si tu ne m'aimes pas, si tu ne m'aimes pas je t'aime  Mais si je t'aime, si je t'aime, prends garde à toi!   &nbsp;  &nbsp; Habanera  from&nbsp;Bizet's  Carmen

       That is my goal. Every minute is a chance for me to feel stronger and better. I feel a strong urge to go out and make new friends, and even to go into a light love affair, a simple story that would not get me involved in a complicated story. I just need to feel like I am interesting to someone's eyes. This is quite a selfish thing. Sounds like I want to use someone to pimp up my own self-esteem. Maybe that is what it really is. But to me it is more like an experiment, a test, and above all a challenge. There is one thing about which I should change my mind -- that is, you don't go with someone because you want to spend the rest of your life with them. That idea has locked me up in a nun-like sentimental life. But why am I so afraid of hurting people?&nbsp;They don't all need&nbsp;life-long&nbsp;promises, most of them are merely searching for affection, communication, and experiments. Experimenting myself. Experimenting the others. Instead of failing to know myself, because I am too afraid of confronting what I am with what the others are. Is it because I am so sensitive that I always think the others are? I do not intend to despise the others' feeling and to act selfishly. It is not in my nature. But I should surely dare more to take what the others have to offer, and give what lies inside of me. There are so many things I would be able to achieve if I only dared to. Of this I am sure. Because I don't want to put boundaries to myself. Everyone is unlimited. The body is a physical limit, but the soul can expand endlessly. And I should let mine expand a bit more. It is yelling for freedom, and for power. Power on what is around me. I am tired of letting things go their own way, tired of being passive. I want to be the creator of my life, life has to be my work of art. This is not supposed to sound conceited, because I do not believe I am a great artist, so my life may not look fantastically original. But it will be what&nbsp;I want it to be and nothing else.&nbsp; Beware, people, Mitternacht is coming back.

      In small things lie precious secrets.   I went out today, to simply have a coffee two blocks away from my appartment, and&nbsp; I decided to open my mind and my heart to what was around me. The street, crowded with tourists and bathed with the late afternoon sunlight, seemed enchanted. I entered that world instead of locking myself up; I wanted to play my part in&nbsp;that simple, beautiful scene, rather than to be a mere frowning dull spectator. I put my most authentic smile on as I entered the café. Talking and laughing with the waiters, I realized I was still able to give and take that simple energy that makes us social animals. I was not trying to forget the things that can&nbsp;throw me down at times, but I was seeing them as a part of what&nbsp;I am, not an ennemy.   The love I feel is strongly anchored in me, but tonight it is not causing me pain, it makes me feel alive and serene, it makes me strong instead of bonding my heart. I do not know what my future will be like, but tonight I see it as an opportunity to make it as beautiful as I wish it to be. Opening my heart was the key. It was so obvious that I feel stupid that I did not do it long before. But I also know how sorrow can make me weak. What I need to learn is to keep an open heart even when sorrow is invading me.   Never forgetting: Blicket auf!

       Everything in one only person. The beginning and the end, the alpha and the omega, pain and joy, fortune and misfortune. There she stands, she is all to me, she is the only one who can soften the pain she is causing to me. And because she tries so hard to heal my broken heart, she is forgiven for having broken it. And she makes me believe I can cope. She has got her own sorrow too, her heart is broken too. Looks like we both were not meant to be loved by those we love. I love her, and she loves me no more. She loves another one, and this other one will not answer her feelings.And I try as hard as&nbsp;I can to help her as much as she helps me, and we both fight against our own weaknesses to cross this ocean of deception, desillusion, guilt and pain.

      I need a place to tell my grieves. And when I have passed through my grieves I will be able to look proudly to the sky and say: now I will live the life I have always dreamt of. I will sculpt my life and myself according to my own dreams and expectations, and to mine only.  Here is the place where I will let myself be sad, and where I will urge myself to go forward. Because there is a time for woe, but life is no eternity.

       Tomorrow I'll be gone to Quebec to have a three-week holiday. My friend does not seem enchanted at the idea of seeing her family, even though she loves them all very much. But she does not feel like they understand her. Well, in fact these holidays may be a bit tough. At least it will wash my mind a bit, I guess. But it surely bring back memories, reminding me of the year we spent in Montreal. I had such a strong faith in our love then. I am too nostalgic, I know that, and it tends to bound my heart. I always feel like things of the past were beautiful and intense, and present is like an eternally renewed loss of the passed moment. This is, I guess, the most depressing conception of life and time one may have. Ok, I need to change that too.

                Finding this picture on the web made me realize how my conceptions could be chlidish at times. My ultimate dream looked like nothing else but that. Me (the red) and Princess Charming (the white). I was quite amused to notice that it resembles us a bit, at least as far as hair-color and height are concerned. Even the attitude: me leaning on her shoulder. And silence. This should be a good warning.

       I was there yesterday evening, having a coffee with my best friend. I opened my heart to him. I told him everything about my failures and my hopes, I tried to explain to him what "love" meant to me. Never would have thought it was so simple to tell someone: "I love like I once loved you; a hopeless feeling you carefully keep alive in your soul, even if it makes you suffer to hell, even if it makes you feel so lonely and desperate, because this feeling is the most precious treasure you have, and because it is so deeply anchored in yourself that letting it fade or die would be the worst treachery to your heart."         But isn't this feeling narcissistic? I mean, maybe we treasure it because it makes us feel alive and romantic, we feel superior because we get the impression that the love we feel is total and infinite, and maybe we end up falling in love with the very feeling of love rather than being in love with the very person.
