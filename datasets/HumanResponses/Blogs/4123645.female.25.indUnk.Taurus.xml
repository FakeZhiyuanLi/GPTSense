      remember in the 80s when the upper-middle classes were dressing their kids in pint-size adult outfits? matching laura ashley dresses come to mind. how about when the whole family would wear matching outfits for the christmas card picture you'd get so the family could brag about little Johnny getting straight As and oldest Mary making cheerleading? i even knew girls who would buy the exact same matching guess outfits and wear them the same day - on purpose - down to the matching socks. anyway, it appears this has now filtered down to the middle classes. either that or there just aren't enough places to shop. while at the super wal-mart (okay, so i HAD to go there before i left for the adirondacks and bliss) i saw a mom and daughter with bright pink tank tops and khaki shorts. i go around the corner and see a dad and son team sporting jean shorts and old navy tee-shirts (although dad's was navy and son's was gray). i walk out the front door and i literally had to stop and stare at the camo hats, jeans, and white tee-shirts of a twenty-something and 50-something pair getting into a pick-up. at this point i was pretty concerned that these kids were going to turn out exactly like their idiot parents. shaking my head as i walked to the car, i almost put out of my mind the bone-thin redneck with the glazed look on her face being led around by her overbearing boyfriend who bumped into me looking methed-out and reeking of alcohol. and for those who care, she did not steal my wallet when she bumped into me, but she DID pick up a VHS tape and stick it in her bag. i hope to God she does not have kids.

      I know the stereotypes of my gender when involved in politics. We're supposedly one issue voters or care more about the look of a candidate than substance. I try to be well informed and impartial when it comes to issues of world importance. But damned if I didn't go to Drudge today and think, "Who cares about privacy issues of a security blimp at the Olympics?!? Look at hottieopoulos!  He can know everything he wants to know about me." And I hate government/public cameras and care very much about privacy issues!  Hrm, guess sometimes one is just a female after all.  urlLink     urlLink

       So, hurricane Alex is coming to ruin several of my friends' vacations and/or vacation homes. The unusal thing, however, is that I had no less than 3 people ask me whether this hurricane has been named for a boy or a girl. (By the way people, I'm glad you think I'm smart, but I'm not Dion or Miss Cleo). And Alex is a boy. The names for 2004 (East Coast hurricanes) are Bonnie, Charley, Danielle, Earl, Frances, Gaston, Hermine, Ivan, Jeanne, Karl, Lisa, Matthew, Nicole, Otto, Paula, Richard, Shary, Tomas, Virginie, and Walter. Next year's 'A' name will be a girl.      In other naming news, my cousin is having her second baby in early November, another girl they think. Now, Veronica had the misfortune to agree to marry a man with the last name Grimes. The January before last, they pulled out the wonderful name of Madeleine Royce for girl number 1. We all thought it was a miracle. Why a miracle? Well, for starters Grimes doesn't sound all that pleasant with most names. In addition, she must avoid the following initials:      PIG   FAG   DOG   LAG   SAG      You get the idea. Can you think of other initial sets or names she should avoid?    Check out the social security website for more examples of bad names.
