      Should I put in so much effort just for her? I want her to be with me so badly... but I don't think it will ever happen... why does it always have to be like this? Every time I fall for a girl and think of her as that one special person, it ends up as a disaster. I think I am not trying hard enough but if I try so hard and fail, I don't know how I will feel. i'm so scared. I wish I knew if she felt the same way bout me. Whenever I think about her I feel a very strange feeling in my stomach. Why can't I just know? Should I try and then leave a possibility for all my effort to be in vain  dammit I don't know what to do?!

      Today I went to a restaraunt called Rasoi!  It is so good. I ate so much. It is wierd with me that I eat so much bt do not gain so much weight. I don't know why. My friends didn't eat that much. They used to be the ones who ate more then me but now it just feels like I am eating alone and everyone is waiting for me to finish. Whatever eating food is awsome when you don't have to worry about weight. I think I get hungry every 2 hours. No wonder I am so sleepy all the time.&nbsp;  Another place I like eating is at  urlLink pizza hut . I love pizza. I think I want some pizza right now....

      poeple we meet in life can have different meanings to us. each person that I meet, Ithink something different of them. there are some in this amazing world that have "caught" my eye. Whether they look good or say something that makes me stop and think. Then there are some in this worl that have become close to me. They are my friends. In my case the only people that I can confide in. Imean not even my mother the one who cares for me day in and day out; the one who's body i lived in for 9 months. It is amazing the emtions I have towards my friends. They are the only people that can turn on a light in my head when it comes to issues that i am not noticing myself. Why must things change and contact be distant between all of us? why does life have to go on? My Friends are some of the most important people in my life and they are my motivation and I guess the shoulders i rest on. I wish I could do half as much as they have done for me. I wish I could be the person that doesn't need them to hold me up. But then again I want them to be there just for the fact that if they weren't my life wouldn't be worth anything. My friends ...

      Bianca... what a girl... what a person when i think of her i start to think how could another person be so much like me? How could she be a person that just "click" with me. She is amazing. Utterley amazing. I can talk to her and never stop talking until my heart stops beating. It is like if i don't talk to her my day is not complete. In some way or another I have to ahev contact with her. I am happy when I think bout her. Have I found someone to be with. So randomly we met. Through a network of friends we know eachother and because of one event I finally met her. Tomorrow if everything works out I will meet her again. Thank you God for this opportunity. When the right opportunity to tell her how I think I feel comes I will take that opportunity I will not let it slip by like I did with Meril and she is 10 times more right for me then Meril. I just pray that she likes me as much as I like her. I really like her. I can tell her. I can do it. I can hope for the best for once and not the worst. It will work out. I have to know it in my heart that it will. I wanna hold her hand when we walk together. If she didn't have a bf when we went to eat ice cream I would've held her hand. I would've told her right there how i feel. Now she is single. I have a chance. I can ask her out. I have to have the courage to ask her out. I must have that courage and sieze the moment that I can ask her. I must.

      why is life so hurtful? I can't forget you ...yet I know that you will never be with me. Why does it have to be this way? Why can't you see that I love you? Every time I see that movie "kal ho naa ho" I think about you. I get knots in my stomach because I can't be with you. I love you. I love you so much that sometimes I think that you could be able to feel what I feel even though I do not say anything. You were right I am crying inside. I'm always crying. Mabye that is why you are not with me. Because I cry... I care for you too much. Why do I love you so much? I know why... the way your eyes fall upon my face. I feel like embracing you with my arms and let you see how much you mean to me. My heart beats for you .... I breath for you. I love you but you do not love me... I wish this wasn't tru but it is. You think I am a looser sometimes. If I try harder you baq away even more. It is not that I don't value your friend ship it is just that,... I love you! dammit! I love you! I pray that you can see that. I dream that one day you will come to me and say "I love  you too" I would be happy if you said "I'll give you a chance" but why do mydreams never come true.... why??
