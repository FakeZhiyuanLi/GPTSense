      sian... today's weights training is a little too crazy... nearly injured my wrists... cauz the old injury acted up again.  anyw, heard some sec 4 or 3 boys from chs cracked dirty jokes in front of some rgs girls... woah, so bold... heard they sent an apology to rgs...  GRRR... so angry abt my parents... they nvr respect my privacy lor... opened my sms everytime they see my fone vibrate. so angry... and they were still shouting at me for toking abt "repecting my privacy"... not onli smses, but sometimes they also  read my letters, and reply to my smses... GRRR!!! I  M MAD!!!  sian, very tired leh, dunno wats the reason. partly due to chem lesson methinks... the stupid orbital concept introduced... madness, we are in sec 3 and they are forcing j1 stuff into our tiny heads... a  huge  contrast from the past two slack days... haha, but tts how school is...  good thing to note... olympics approaching... yeah, hope to see judo being aired...

       wow... today is not bad too... slacking the whole day long, especially for english lesson. best man, triple period for maths turns out to be a stupid lesson on moral implications of gambling... so called lesson on probability.   anyw, fun, the mr ang, our maths olympiad teacher in charge was sick, so released us quite early... in fact, half an hour before normal. COOL! if not, wont feel like buying jolin's mv for jiaqi... killed too many brain cells during the 4 hours of maths todae...  worrying about rising financial demands... judo camp, orange belt gradin, national judo champioships all coming in june... oh man, all demands money... start saving now or good luck for me. lucky gaobin called up and said his father had a job for me again for june. so, i think i haf to be a telephone salesman to for the entire month of june... haiz, its either like tat, or no money.  well, on the bright side, my results haf improved from last term. lucky...
