      man....i had nothing to do today. no one to hang with, no where to go, just a plain boring day all by myself.  o well....ill live. anyways this is my very first post, yay for me...lol.   the poem i wrote a while ago...   when you walk away, you dont hear me say please, o baby dont go. simple and clean is the way that you make me feel tonight, its hard to let go.  the daily things, that keep us busy. are confusing me, thats when you came to me, and said. wish i could prove i love you, but does that mean i have to walk, on water. when we are older you'll understand its enough when i say, so and maybe some things are that simple.  hold me, whatever lies beyond this morning, will be forgoten later on. regardless the warnings the future doesnt scare me at all, nothing is like before.  when you walk away, you dont hear me say please, o baby, dont go. simple and clean is the way that you make me feel tonight, its hard to let go  o ya....lol

      yesterday... called dj over and hung out for a while...ya great fun...then called colin up to go to the pool to play tennis and then to go swimming. we kept throwing the ball out of the pool and had nikhita go and get it for us everytime...lol. then me and dj left the pool to go to the movies with malorie and breanna..we watched dodgeball(great movie)...ya. after that we went back to malories house to hang for a while...then later we started to play demon...i won of course..lol. about and hour later we came back here to my house to eat and mess around...great fun also. then we all went to the fire work stand up the hill to go and buy fireworks...it started to get late so we started back home...then half way home, malorie, colin and i ditched dj and breanna and went down the trail to cut them off...lol but that didnt work out too well..we ended up way behind them and had to run to catch up with them. then when we got back to my house we hung out and talked for a little while longer and then malories mom came to pick them up and so they left...then after that, me dj and colin played poker with my dad for money(colin ended up winning)...then when we were done we got up and went outside to go sleep in the tent...went to sleep real fast...i stayed up to think about things...ya then today we got up, ate breakfast and played poker again...this time me and dj tied so we split the pot and we both won $10...o well that was my day...

      another author will not be named...  my love for you, you may never know, but this love i shall not show.  when i look into your eyes,it's like gazing into the bright beautiful skies.  this love for you is o so deep, so deep that that i think of you while i sleep.  when i'm with you, i get all warm inside, but still my love for you is still to hide. Away, back deep into my heart, hoping that we shall never part.  i cant get you outa my head but i dont care, a life without you is not fair.  but maybe its not meant to be, us together you and me.  but we might not never know, or at least till my love will surly show.  author: anonymous

      lol....another poem....  love is something only two people can share. but to some, love is not fair.  love is nothing but a word with no emotion at all. i know now because my heart just took a great fall.  but if it is just a word why do i feel so bad. now that i have lost everything i had.  i guess love wasnt meant for me, at least not till i find the one to be   ya

      i see you there, o so beautiful and bright, sitting here with me under the moonlight. &nbsp; most nights i wonder about you and me, wondering if it was meant to be. &nbsp; i cant live without you girl, i just wouldnt know what to do, but there is a feeling inside me that draws me closer to you. &nbsp; but not letting you know of this feeling is probably the wrong thig to do, i dont know...keeping it inside seems easier than telling you. &nbsp; but one day we will know if it was meant to be, just once i would like to know if you were meant for me. &nbsp; give me a chance, whats the worst that could happen. &nbsp; ya
