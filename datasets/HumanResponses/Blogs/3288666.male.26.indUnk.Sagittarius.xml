      First time visiting today. First time actually inside the old Long John Silver's since I got some fish sticks with my parents in 1995. Service was dog-slow, but my American Dog was good. It was the toasted almost-french-bread bun that made the meal a success. And the onion rings were tasty -- always a good sign, I suppose. Was interested in how they could get away with cous-cous as a side, but I suppose there haven't been any law-enforcement types to notice.

So, on May 16, 2004, Comic Relief, the charity organization Zmuda founded in 1985, will present . . . something. Something secretive, something at House of Blues on Sunset Strip. Title: Andy Kaufman -- Dead or Alive?"

      Camus' full quote is: 'A guilty conscience needs to confess. A work of art is a confession.' His Notebooks are among the richest written words ever published. To be able to take those minor but powerful thoughts and create 'The Stranger' is a wonder, even now. Hopefully, I'll be able to make sense of my thoughts in some way. (Only more wordy and ultimately not as good.)

       urlLink USATODAY.com - President resumes campaign in battleground states   "My opponent has good intentions, but intentions do not always translate to results"  "Results matter."  "They're going to raise taxes, we're not"  "[Kerry is] running as fast and as far as he can from that record."  Okay, why-oh-why is Bush running on his record? Catering to corporate interests, selling our solvency down the river, UNSIGNING treaties, stretching our military, backdoor drafting men and woment into combat, crippling our seniors, killing working-class jobs, dividing our country and its people, etc.  And unless you can pay for a house IN CASH, you won't get taxed any more than you are now. Less, perhaps. Especially if you do something that helps society. Like educating your children. Volunteering. Not so much for living off dividends. Or duping investors for their pensions. Less so for that.

       urlLink Michael Novak on the Democrats and George Bush on National Review Online   "... I see six reasons why the Democratic goose is cooked:   1. No one — neither his colleagues nor his wife nor his supporters nor he himself — has anything good to say about John Kerry except that he served bravely in Vietnam. The nearly 30 years since then have generated few boasts on his part, few commendations from others, few successes anyone can seem to remember.  2. The Democratic elite sitting in convention cannot present themselves as they are to the American people, but must stifle their deepest feelings, be silent about their most passionate aims, and hide their turbulent loathing of George Bush Republicans (lest it frighten independents with its ferocity). The Democratic elite is saying as little as possible about same-sex marriage. And guns. And very little about abortion. And not a word about total withdrawal of American troops from Iraq — quite the opposite. Democratic elites do not want the people to know what they really think. On that ground, they fear they will lose.  3. Democrats must hide from the public what they truly think about evangelicals, fundamentalists, and Catholics. They express these thoughts mostly among themselves.  4. John Kerry looks sillier in the pale blue NASA rabbit suit than Michael Dukakis did in a tank.  5. The months of April, May, and June were so heavy with bad news for George Bush — the huge Sorosian expenditures on anti-Bush ads came at him in torrents — and still he held even with Kerry in the polls. It is hard not to believe that there will be at least a slight change in the roaring winds. When it comes (and the change is already underway), it is bound to push Bush's sails steadily ahead as the weeks roll on.  6. The worst lies told by the Democrats about Bush — those of Joe Wilson, Michael Moore, and others, saying that Bush lied about Iraq — have already been proven wrong by the 9/11 Commission (which was supposed to blow Bush out of the water just before the election, but ended up destroying his worst calumniators). These lies were also proven wrong by the British inquiry. Even the Kerry Convention in Boston ended up taking the Bush strategic line in Iraq, except for one thing: Kerry is wistful about the probability of persuading France and Germany to bear some burden on behalf of liberty in Iraq. Good luck! God knows, Bush and Colin Powell tried."  Okay. One by one.  1. Untrue, obviously. Cue the stories about Kerry giving up his 'name bills' because of really nice, personal reasons. (Retiring colleagues, behind-the-door deals -- oddly enough some people (Republicans -- but Democrats, too) will give up their principles for some simple press coverage.) Fast-forward to his bi-partisan efforts. Oddly enough, the Senate Intelligence Committe is kinda important. Providing valuable oversight, direction and leadership into America's foreign policy is a little more time-consuming than the Byron Dorgan 'Reforming America's Amusement Parks' Act. (Yeah, made it up.) It's not like he has time after intelligence briefings (direction of which is handled by the NSA, CIA, etc. -- Not something that can be shoehorned into a bill for health care or the environment or education or the march towards full equality among Americans that the senator also cares about) to whip out a bill that fix complex issues without the research (not necessarily secret industry-insider deals run by, say, the Vice-President) that goes into understanding a problem enough to fix it for 170 million households. Frankly, he had to sacrifice his career to be a father to his girls and later America needed a behind-the-scenes advocate for our ideals and values. We didn't need another flashy rockstar senator. We needed John Kerry.  2. Okay, we hate what the Administration has done to our America. They mislead and misinform and call it good policy. Clear Skies. No Child Left Behind. Jesus. And we're letting them RUN ON IT. The same-sex thing is fundamentally about curbing the divisive politics of hatred invented by their side of the aisle. ('Jefferson is dead.')  Kerry championed the purity of our Consitution, to resounding applause. No one wants (except for the crazies: Nader, Kucinich) a full pullout from Iraq. You suck.  3. Little paranoid, no? Kerry hates Catholics -- pass it on.  4. He looks good, actually. He could actually pass for someone who has read a book and could be trusted with expensive equipment. Or a bicycle. Yes, we did lose our first M1 Abrams tank in Iraq. Many, unfortunately. No connection.  5. So, you're saying that your guy should be down a lot more? Okay. Cool.  6. Not really. The Bush Administration gets blamed appropriately. The British inquiry you should have just left out, because we'll look it up. Old Europe hates Bush and Powell. Bullies that soil the reputation of their countries don't often get high-fives at the G8.  He also mentions something about Kerry stealing Bush's Iraq plan. That's brilliant. I can't get enough of these people.

       urlLink GeorgeWBush.com :: Talking Points - July 2004   What the hell? These are the master strategists? 'John Kerry on Hunting'? We've got a race in which the opponents disagree on affirmative action, the environment, human rights, foreign policy, economics, social policy and health care and the best thing they could come up with on July 10th is hunting? (By the way, Kerry is a hunter and from what I've read, a damn good shot.)

       urlLink "While he has promised to pay for his healthcare and education plans by raising taxes on people who make more than $200,000 a year, he still comes up billions of dollars short.'"   First, he doesn't come up billions short. Secondly, they don't want to play the math game, do they? No one cares. Seriously. John Q. Taxpayer believes that the government is rolling in cash. Their cash, but whatever. Will there be a higher tax-burden for the wealthy after Kerry removes the ill-considered tax cut for the richest two percent? Yes. Will it be worth it for millions of uninsured Americans who will be able to make it through sudden illness during their pursuit of the American dream? Yes. Should hard-working Americans be derailed in their hopes because this Administration panders to the corporate insurers and the pharmaceutical companies. No. Help is on the way.  And seriously, do they really want to get people to decide who's more fiscally conservative? Mr. Missing Ten Billion Dollars or the guy who has worked to keep the government on track for twenty years?

       urlLink GOP vows to run on, not away from Bush's record - The Washington Times: Nation/Politics - July 30, 2004 : "We're going to run on President Bush's record. We're going to run on his record of accomplishment in the war against terror. We're going to run on his accomplishments regarding our economy. We're going to run on all of his accomplishments, and we're not going to run away from them,' said former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "  Isn't that what you're supposed to do? I mean, regular incumbents. Your tone, Rudy, suggests that, oh, I don't know, maybe the majority of the American people think that the president's lack of principles and delegated leadership would be best rewarded with a flight back to Crawford.  "Democrats avoided any mention of Sen. John Kerry's 20-year voting record in favor of deep cuts in defense and intelligence programs and his opposition to across-the-board income-tax cuts and the $87 billion military funding bill for the troops in Iraq, a phalanx of top Republicans said at a press conference."  Yep, a fifteen year-old bipartisan reduction of unused military bases means that Kerry's going to strip the miliary and give Osama bin Laden the launch codes to the Tridents. An example across-the-board income tax cut: a family pulling in $30,000 would save $15. A single white male earning seven figures annually would keep somewhere in the thousands of dollars. Damn that John Kerry and his destruction of the middle class. The funding thing is almost a joke now, since most people are smart enough to understand HOW BLOODY FRICKIN' CONGRESS OPERATES. I liked the word phalanx. It nearly makes up for the automatic restatement of the Republican Attack Machine's divisive vitrol.

       urlLink Giuliani: "They don't want the American people to know that the nominee for the Democratic Party [is] the senator in the U.S. Senate who had the single-most liberal voting record -- more liberal than Hillary Clinton, more liberal than Ted Kennedy".    Also, later on...   "Giuliani described Kerry, on the other hand, as a waffler, noting that the Massachusetts senator voted for an Iraq war resolution but against an $87-billion supplemental appropriation to support the war effort in Iraq and Afghanistan."   One thing: he can't be much of a waffler. That would mean that he's waffling within the leftist extreme of the Democratic Party, which, if I'm right, means that he's not waffling. You can't change your mind all the time and still be ideologically consistent. Maybe they're just talking about the war in Iraq and the vote in particular. Well, this is from the same people that brought you the  urlLink 350 tax increases or whatever . It's clear that they have either a severe logic problem or have no idea how the legislative process works.&nbsp;Imagine a bill that protected the elderly from shark attacks. (The Bush Administration would spin this one as 'Saving America's Water from Terrorists'). But the nut-job idealogues and their cohorts made the bill fund itself by charging the elderly who are attacked the balance of their life savings. (Eliminating the moral hazard of indifference to shark-mauling. Armchair economists all, you see. New name: 'Protecting America's Freedom') I would damn well have voted for it, before the shock troopers on the other side of the aisle made it intolerable. Who would have thought that complex and nuanced legislative matters would require more than poly-repetitive slogans and artificial simplicity?

       urlLink "This world of ours is changing..."   ... so one must change with the times. So, why exactly are you hitting Kerry on having opinions that require more than a backdrop-ready slogan to explain?  A bloated military in 1990 geared to fight the Soviet Empire may not be the most adaptable. (Bush the 41st) You adapt according to the times, since, well, at the time the entire Arab and Muslim world didn't totally hate us. When Kerry and all of the sane people in Congress voted to streamline military spending then, (i.e. axing dangerous and wasteful programs, thank you President Reagan) he didn't have to face the prospect of a world that is all-too-ready to let the United States hang in the breeze. We were able to muster support for what was right in the world just a year later in early 1991. Could we do that now?  ... later: "There is nothing complicated about supporting our troops in combat."  Wow, they might not be as bad off as I thought. Karl Rove with kids is still Karl Rove. And Karen Hughes is the best at what she does. It's going to be a fight of messages, not who has the best ideas, I'm afraid. Kerry has to stay with the notion that the ideas are the message -- that the optimism and hope in his plan will prevail and will help millions of regular Americans with health care, jobs, and provide a safer, more respected America than the one he inherits.

      1. Kerry was right about the $20 billion breakout being mismanaged. Only $450 million has been spent to allegedly help the war effort. Even less, if any, before the 'Mission Accomplished' party. 2. Do you think if another Milosevic comes along we'll be able to put together a legitimate coalition of any sort? 3. Kerry is the only one to be able to say to France and Germany 'Get with the program -- you don't have George Bush to use as an excuse anymore."  And Zell Miller is getting worse and worse. What a sad figure.

       urlLink Tom Ridge to Leave Administration?   It seems that an income in the top 5% isn't enough to put a couple kids through college anymore. Moreover, Secretary Ridge doesn't seem to hold out much hope that the Bush Administration will do anything for assisting more Americans in reaching higher education in his second term.
