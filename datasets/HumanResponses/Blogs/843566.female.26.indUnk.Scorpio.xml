      J: "I watched a pretty good show the other day." Me: "Oh yeah, what was it?" J: "Queer as Folk." Me: "I've never seen it, but I hear it's not bad."  [small pause]  J: "There's just one thing odd about it... everyone on it is just so Gay!"  [bigger pause]  Me: "uh huh"

      He reads John Irving out loud to his co-workers and doesn’t understand why they don’t laugh. I of course smiled and chuckled into my mug of hot chocolate. “A Prayer for Own Meany” is one of my favourite books, but it’s not one you can randomly read out loud and expect everyone to be on board with the humour.   But he’s oblivious to that.   He’s also oblivious to the people waiting in line for their coffees. Instead he fiddles with the radio, does a little moonwalk and treats the harried lunch crowd to a crooked smile and a tone-deaf rendition of Thriller.   When he buses he gives each table a half hearted wipe, moving crumbs around or pushing them to the floor, then he precariously balances piles of dishes, leaving a trail of sugar packets behind him.   He swears when he burns his fingers (again) on the cappuccino machine. He gives people napkins that asked for straws and change to people who haven’t paid. You would guess it’s either his first day, his last day or he’s family.  When it’s slow and almost everyone is gone, he plunks down a window seat and pulls out a pad and a pencil stub; Quick lines, a frowning wrinkle between his eyebrows, a murmur or two. Then he tears off the top sheet, crumples it up and tosses to my table.   It bounces, and dances away. I retrieve it, take a look, the world’s worst picture of a boy giving a girl a daisy. When I look up, he’s at the door giving me a wink and poof, he's gone.   This is either love or a profound respect for endearingly bad customer service.

      I think maybe I was meant to be an old man in this lifetime. I seem to have true fondness towards my outdoor rocking chair, a good book, flannel pants and peppermint candies.   Do you ever think to yourself, “This isn’t my life, this just isn’t where I was meant to be?”  Some days, I come home and don’t talk to a single soul from the time I open my door to the time I close my eyes. I catch myself wondering what little piece of my personality I just lost, and what I might have gained.   I need some good book recommendations. I wandered around the library for an hour on Monday, running my fingers down spines, avoiding titles, trying to sense how many people have read and loved each book.   I’m sitting beside my open front door, there’s a wind coming in from the lake. I have a set of chimes that make almost no sound, just the odd clink every couple of minutes. My cat is sitting exactly half in and half out of the house. Every few second I find myself holding my breath in for an extra few beats of my pulse; when I was a child, I thought holding your breath meant you were stopping time. I know that’s foolish, but even as an adult I do it subconsciously whenever I’m in a good moment.   Somehow I need to figure out a way to work this peace into the rest of the day.  Do I move farther into the country, work for less, inhabit less space, aspire to less of a material future, spend more time watching the trees grow.   There just has to be more to it then this.

      I was sitting in a Boardroom today with a bunch of stuffed shirts in ties, feigning concern that a lot of our shipments had been delayed lately, when in through the half closed door wafted a huge stream of cursing. Being the only female in the room, a few of the men glanced in my direction to see how I would react. (I work in the transportation industry – men dominated = lots of sexism)   Frankly I didn’t really give a fuck, but one of the men must have mistaken my look of bored indifference for shocked sensibilities because he got up and stepped out of the room. Through the door, we could all hear him chewing out the driver, while we all pointedly looked about the room, avoiding direct contact and engaging in polite chit chat, waiting for his return.   He had no sooner sat down; when through the door we heard:  “Can you believe he told me I swear too much, I don’t fucking swear too much.”  Blame the cough syrup but, I dropped my work façade for a second and started to laugh.   “That was funny, because you just told him he swore too much, and then he swore when he was denying he swore to much… ha ha ha….” Realizing I was entirely on my own, out on a limb, I gave myself a mental kick in the ass and shut it.   I tell ya, absolutely zero sense of irony in this crowd.

      My first official day back to work after two weeks and if I weren’t already feeling rough I would have been by end of day.   I lost count on how many times I heard:  “You look so tired.” “Still got a cough huh.” “You look sick, I’m staying away from you.”  The people that insist on telling you about every illness that they’ve ever had are barrels of fun, as if listening to their gross detailed description of ailments is going to make you feel any better. My absolute favourite though, is the doomsayers who insist that you aren’t well and should be at home (despite your protests) because they know better then you, how you are feeling.  I was about ready to tell the next well meaning person who dropped a comment on my head, right where to go, when one of my more enlightened co-workers came over and did a double take.   “Damn, Anne came over and told me you were 5 minutes away from death’s door. So I waited 5½ minutes to come over and steal your office supplies.”  Asshole. =)

      Some days I feel like I could just write and write forever and just keep pouring out anything that popped up in my mind. I have no notions of being a writer of the official capacity but the actual act of writing I find to be very therapeutic, for me it’s the fastest way to simplify your thought process and clarify what is really important. I find that like most people I tend to guilt myself a lot internally, constantly harping on certain areas of my life, job, money, relationships, etc… Adding to the stress I already feel from external sources. It’s really very counter-productive and silly, but for some unknown reason I am unable to stop myself from nagging myself. Writing allows me to temporarily turn off some of the voices, and to re-route that energy into a different direction.    For 3½ years I had an online diary that I updated religiously on the opendiary.com website. I was one of the first people to start writing on that site and for the first couple of years I absolutely loved the daily 2 hours I spent there writing and reading. However, there began to be a great deal of pressure to respond to people’s comments and to explain items I had written. I guess after being a part of people’s daily life for so long, they began to feel as though they have a say or a right to dictate to a degree what I wrote about, or when I should provide further clarification and details.   It began to become a chore to write, and ironically enough the writing became another source of stress. Entirely my own fault, as I was cocky enough to like the attention I was receiving and stupid enough to think I had to meet people’s expectations in order to keep their attention.   Around the same time I received an odd e-mail in my inbox from an individual (Stephen) who had followed my ramblings for a number of months and had actually gone back and read my entire collection. By this point I had written over 500 single spaced letter size pages (I kept a printer version in a 3 inch binder) so right away my attention was captured by such a feat of insanity.  Thus began an e-mail saga that would continue well into the next 3 years of my life, and become my first experience of a true meeting of the minds. Eventually I realized I was being a fool and took my stressful diary offline, and wrote solely to Stephen and on paper.  Long story short (yeah right, once I get started I can be incredibly verbose) this is my first attempt to seriously make a go at writing online again, while still maintaining my integrity. I’ve decided to post my URL in a few places, but I’m not going to make any attempt to gain readership, at least for the first little while. It would be nice to confirm I can indeed write for myself, while still being aware of the fact I may or may not have an audience.   So is there a point to this ramble… not really.   I am just feeling incredibly reminiscent today and wanting to browse in words through my thoughts. It’s been a long time since I last wrote/talked to Stephen, things became complicated when we started to cross the lines of penpal to phone pal and potential real life pal. We both loved books, writing, talking, discovering new areas of the world, and laughing, but we could just never quite agree on what future our relationship could have. I truly do not believe that you can fall in love without ever knowing a person in real life, and obviously Stephen felt differently about that.   I’ve been asked if I miss him, of course I do. You can’t share your inner thoughts and laughter with someone for so long and not miss that relationship. Whether it’s friendship or companionship, you always miss those that have touched your life and left lasting marks on your mind. Oddly enough, sometimes I picture him out there reading books, writing thoughts and I wonder if he’s thinking of me, imagining me doing the same.   It’s a strange comfort.  Life is like that. You meet people, you interact, and sometimes you have a profound impact on someone’s life in just 5 minutes, other times it takes years.  On the flip side, you may see someone or talk to someone everyday of your life and never give him a thought but for those moments spent in his presence.   That too is a strange comfort; knowing that not everyone occupies a permanent place in your thoughts, but at the same time knowing that there are those special few who always will.

      I went to see my Gramma yesterday, as I had not seen her for a number of weeks due to the fact that I was at home hallucinating about getting my head amputated. My Gramma is 88 years old and pretty sick, but still somewhat independent living alone with a never ending rotation of family checking up on her. My visit ended up being a 9 hour one, because she wasn’t well enough to be alone and no one else was around, but with her amusing rambling character it was hardly an inconvenience.   Without trying and generally without realizing she’s even done it, my Gramma says some fairly funny things when you read between the lines. She usually sits in this little sunroom at the back of her house, as it has a nice view of her backyard as well as a section of her neighbours yard and driveway. While doing at home dialysis 4 times a day, she spends a lot of time sitting in this one spot, as a result all her stories tend to begin from this same spot.    The man next-door has a nice son; you should go over and introduce yourself. He seems to take very good care of his parents and the house, I see him outside daily gardening. Of course he does play loud music when he is outside, which I find very disturbing.   [pause while she plays with the dialysis setup]  He doesn’t seem to bring home many girls, only a few that I’ve seen. He does have quite a few male friends though. They’re constantly in and out of that drive-way during the day and at night.   [insert 5 minute explanation of times when she has seen male friends come and go]  He’s a teacher you know, at the public school. Teaches music and art. I guess that’s why he listens to so much music.   You know my sister Gwen dated a man very much like him one time. They were a very serious couple; he was the most courteous escort. Always had Gwen home on time, opened her door, even helped my mother make her summer jam one time.   [insert another 5 minute ramble on about parties they went to and dresses Gwen wore]  Of course in the end it didn’t work out. The young man ended up moving to the city and going into the arts. He always wanted to be an actor, he was a dramatic chap, always waving his hands around and telling these grand stories. He would have made a very good performer, we were constantly in stitches when he was around.   Poor Gwen she never did see anyone nearly as refined and graceful as him. Well you’ve seen you’re great uncle, could you ever imagine him opening her door with a flourish.   [Another pause to clean the tube]  These days a teacher is a very good job. There’s job security in that, and they get paid very well.    Of course what Gramma is really saying can be summed up as follows:    I can’t understand why you are still unmarried. Women your age should be at home with a house full of children, I just can’t understand you independent types. Sometimes a lady has to grab the horse by the reins and take initiative, straighten your hair and go over and introduce yourself and maybe finally get married.   He’s not perfect he does seem to be somewhat fussy about the garden and I can’t understand why he lives at home still. It’s not like he can’t afford a home with a teacher’s salary, although he might be a bit of a mamma’s boy.   Honestly, why he listens to so much music, and what he and his friends are doing at all hours of the days, I don’t know. He obviously needs a female to curb his bachelor ways.   Gwen should have been firmer and insisted that he stay here and marry her. Who ever heard of a farmer’s son going to the city and becoming an actor? It just isn’t done. Gwen said he insisted he was a confirmed bachelor and was never going to marry, but I know if Gwen had spent more time in the kitchen learning how to make jam and less time at barn dances he might have rethought leaving.   Of course he was an awful silly boy, always flapping his arms about and talking in a high-pitched voice, and fussy, much fussier then the boy next door with his gardens.    [Insert Gramma’s internal cogs rapidly spinning as she begins to put two and two together]  Still he makes very good money, and has a nice stable job. You should get over there and introduce yourself.    I actually already know the nice boy next-door. When you grow up in such a small community, even after living away from it for close to ten years, you still “know” people. We chit chat a bit every time we run into each other coming or going. His name is Aaron and I can never look at his face without remembering the time a group of us skipped 4th period in our senior year so we could sit in the local coffee shop and listen to Aaron tell us the best method for giving blow jobs.   After all we were all going to university in the fall, and Aaron was the resident expert on this particular topic.

      When I first moved to this city almost exactly two years ago, I had one weekend to find a new apartment and get everything in order as I started work on Monday. My sister, who lives here, was helping me out that weekend and we ran like mad from appointment to appointment looking for the right apartment. I have lived in a lot of places for someone who is 26; so I have some experience at judging an apartment and a landlord relatively quickly to avoid potential disasters.    Obviously when I saw this apartment I knew this was the one. Top floor of a house, nice porch, a conservation area behind the house, and open field in front, the lake a two-minute walk away, and only neighbours on either side of the house to deal with. Best of all work was a 3 minute drive away on quick side roads.  Downtown (if you can call it that) was about 7 minutes away, the mall and box stores -10 minutes.   So it was perfect, in my book. I was told that living in the “South End” was not recommended as the area had a certain reputation. However, I felt confident after seeing the area, that I had actually missed most of south end hot spots, by living so far south I was almost in the lake.   I have lived here for two years now and I can definitely say that I have indeed missed the hot spot, and I can actually point out the “borderline.” It happens to be between my house and my neighbours to the North.   This morning at 6:00 am, I had the chance to witness one of my redneck neighbours at their absolute best. My bedroom is at the front of the house, and through 2 rather large windows I have an excellent view of my neighbours overflowing driveway of never-ending cars.  Today at the crack of dawn my neighbour was standing in a car where the engine normally is, headbanging to Chubawamba (sp?) drinking a beer and singing at the top of his lungs.   There are just so many things wrong with that picture I don’t even know where to start.   Within ten minutes, the father of the beer guzzling wannabe Canadian idol, was in the drive-way screaming that if his son woke up the neighbours (again) he was going to %^$*& his ass, all the while holding up his rather loose boxers with one hand to only slightly cover his own ass. Then the mother appeared, beer can in hand, laundry basket on hip, screaming at her husband, while he was screaming at his son.  While I sat there eating my cheerios I couldn’t help but think I really ought to get a video camera and start filming this stuff, considering the quality of most reality TV shows, I must be sitting on a mint. However, I was quickly distracted from my money-making schemes, by the arrival of the “girlfriend” who was dropped off at the curb by a black car with no muffler.   Imagine her surprise to find the whole family out on the driveway to witness her return; I gathered normally when she sneaks in, the three of them are passed out on the floor.

      When I left the house today my skin was pasty, I was squinting my eyes and even my legs felt a little wobbly like I had just been at sea, or learned to walk. Feeling somewhat pathetic I decided to go for a short walk at one of my favourite conservation areas.   I truly cannot believe how much spring has sprung (Sorry occasionally a bad cliché slips in) I wasn’t even out of the car ten minutes and I was noticing the flowers, bees and even a couple of frisky chipmunks. Without thinking, I attempted to photograph the chipmunks but couldn’t quite frame the shot. After moving quietly closer and shifting my position a couple of times I finally had a good angle, but they had basically stopped moving. Thinking that I had maybe missed my opportunity, while at the same time thanking the big guy I wasn’t a chipmunk, I waited a second, camera to eye to see if anything would happen.   It suddenly dawned on me that I was attempting to shoot chipmunk porn. Sure, it would have been a funny picture, good for at least one birthday card. But, taking a quick snap or an accidental picture of chipmunk porn is one think, egging them on in your head and trying for angles, is something else entirely.   Feeling a tad sheepish, I lowered the camera and continued down the path of good taste.   *grin*

      Turns out I have been more productive then I thought. Judging from my inbox, I’ve sent quite a few e-mails, 75% of which I feel need to a) apologize for b) claim my e-mail was hacked and thus were not written by me, and c) have absolutely no explanation for and will now have to cut off all contact with the recipient in case they ever request clarification.   There’s a stack of books by my bed that are beginning to look vaguely familiar although for the life of me some of them I’m not sure if I read, flipped through, or have never opened.    My paper journal has about 10 new pages in it, some of which are so off the wall and incoherent I feel the need to rip them out of the book and burn them. Add an additional 20 or so pages written prior to my illness where I apparently felt the need to go back through and emphasis certain words with multiple highlighters and doodle stickman pictograms. God forbid, my biographers discover them 60 years from now and start rumours of mental instability and lofty artistic notions.    I also discovered some rather fascinating pictures of my feet on my digital camera, which leads me to believe that I must have been desperate to go out and take pictures, but lacked the energy to leave my bed. (And apparently the originality to take pictures of anything even slightly more photogenic then my feet.)   All in all, the situation is somewhat comical, and simply reinforces my belief that people who live alone are always two steps away from total nuttiness. Add a pint of cough syrup, some free time, and crank the internal heat and within a week a reasonably intelligent, mentally fit individual has developed a foot fetish, told her boss in an e-mail that we should have disco days to improve productivity and written the definitive essay on why Ernie is better than Burt.

      I swear only a few days ago I came home early from work with a bit of a temperature and lay down on my bed for a short rest, it’s now been two weeks and I have only left my apartment a total of 5 times for less than 5 hours combined. This morning I woke up totally disorientated, knowing I had been sick, but I truly had no idea I had been out of it for so long.   It’s all a blur, a mishmash of mixed up memories: waking up at night completely drenched with the memory of drowning in a ship, having a conversation with a deceased friend and at the time questioning whether it was real or a dream, at one point looking for a screwdriver because I was convinced I had to screw my roof back on after a storm.    I know people have come to see me, there’s food I wouldn’t normally buy in my fridge, flowers that are beginning to wilt and my cat appears to still be alive so someone must have fed him a few times.   It’s just so disorientating to wake up this morning with a cough, a headache, sore shoulder blades, but for the most part feeling normal, yet having little memory of the previous weeks.   For all I know I could have won the lottery, cured cancer, and become famous, or I might have just spent two weeks in bed, coughing up a lung and having soulful conversations with my cat.

      Eventually, after some more knocking and calling of my name the guy in the basement wandered back to his hole. I don’t particularly care why he came a-knocking, and as far as I’m concerned that fact that he has seen me naked without my permission and made a point of bringing it to my attention obliterates any need for me to ever speak to him again. I realize that it was not his fault he saw me naked, but truly if he had any sense of decency upon seeing my state, he should have never knocked, and instead taken the high road and come back later. At that point he could have mentioned it in a gee I’m sorry I didn’t really see anything way, or entirely left it unsaid. Either would certainly been far more polite.   The Louds came at 11:30, after I had just stepped out of the shower and was now looking more human. Can I move my car, they want to trim the bush beside it. Yeah sure, I was actually just leaving to go for a drive anyway. So then the male Loud stands in my doorway for 30 minutes going on about the price of gas, while I made a point of jingling my keys and sending body signals for him to move so I can close my door and go.   I get to the bottom of the stairs, two steps behind the male Loud who was still babbling on, only to be further drawn into their world by the female Loud, who is going on about power spraying the cement around the base of the house today. Didn’t the male think I should close my windows, just so nothing got wet? (Christ it’s 3 feet of cement 2 stories below) but whatever I went back up to unlock and close my windows so they would just shut up. I turn around in my living room and am startled by the fact that the female has followed me into my house and is now standing two feet behind me looking around the room.   So far other then the mandatory fire safety checks, maintenance and occasional with reason visit, I have managed to avoid having them in my actual living areas. Being in an already extremely grouchy mood, I was further annoyed to see her standing there in her wet, muddy shoes for no reason other then noisiness.   Wow that’s a nice picture, who took that? She asks, pointing to my wall.   I did.   Really wow, what about that one who took that.  I did.   Wow, and did you take…I interrupted, I took all the pictures on that wall.   (Incidentally these are all OBVIOUSLY picture of the SAME family and friends, all in B&W, taken in the same sort of shooting style)  Wow, I never knew you were into photography.   At which point I must have given here, how a “how dumb are you look” because she immediately stumbled on with, well I’ve seen you carrying a couple of tripods, and with a camera a few times, but I guess I just never put two and two together.   Now at this point I am in a Royal snit, I swear inside I was just ranting a mile a minute and ready to snap. But watching her standing their mumble on about my bloody pictures, all the while dripping chunks of mud on my carpet, while her bloody husband yelled from outside about me moving my car, my funny bone began to vibrate.  By the time I finally managed to actually physically move her along the hallway and out the apartment by walking straight towards her and not stopping, I was feeling dryly amused.  &nbsp;Locking the door firmly behind me, I made a mental note to pick up the local rental ads while running my morning errands.

      Sometimes I just feel anti-social and I have some real privacy issues with my personal space. That being said, my current living situation breaks down as follows: I live in an apartment on the second floor of a house. Below me are the landlord’s 32-year-old daughter, her 6-year-old daughter and her newly wedded husband. In the basement is a 30 something guy and his young son. I’ve lived her for almost exactly 2 years, the family below, lets call them “the Louds” have been here for at least 5 years, and the guy in the basement about a year.   I’m a friendly person I can get along with most anyone, but in most situations I have a set of walls up, the height determined by how close I want a person(s) to get. When I moved here, I had just come off a stretch of living for a year and a bit by myself for the first time ever. Prior to that, from ages 1 –17 I lived at home, 18-24 with various roommates in a different place almost each year, 24 –25 by myself in a sardine can, 25 to present where I am now.   As you can tell this entry has absolutely no writing style or flow to it, because I have a headache and am feeling cranky. Since no one ever leaves comments and few people actually read this, I don’t anticipate this being a problem.   Back to the point. When I first moved in here, I didn’t know anyone in the city, I had no vehicle and I had just ended a long-term relationship and my new job was a nightmare. Frankly, I just wanted the world to piss off and leave me alone for a while as things were not going my way. So the walls were really high. I didn’t make friends with the former basement guy (in fact I can’t even say if I ever knew his name, and if I did, I can’t recall it now) I was friendly with the Louds, but in the at an arms length, I’m really-rather-busy-doing-my-thing-right-now kinda way.&nbsp;   Then I discovered that the Louds were one of those drama couples that would have big obnoxiously loud fights in the middle of the night that resulted in lots of door slamming, arm waving and even a few runs through the backyard with the female Loud chasing the male Loud (whom she had no hope of catching, the guy is half jack rabbit) to I can only assume bash in his head.   As you may have noticed from my often-droll writing style, I am not a person given to dramatics. Given my family history and upbringing I also do not condone violence and ongoing fighting in any form, and am actually ridiculously intolerant towards people that choose to fight as a way to communicate.   Yeah I know, I’m rambling.. Get to the point already.   So it’s been two years and suddenly through some inexplicable shift in the universe, the “neighbours” are suddenly eager to become buddy-buddy. Friendly, chit chat in the driveway, the odd drink on the balcony, even play time with the kids I don’t mind. Buddy-buddy I have a problem with. I like being able to come home, sit on my balcony and be one with my world, without fear of constant interruption. But apparently for the Louds, the fact that the female has the summer off, and they have just married seems to have brought out their sentimental lets be friends with the world side. As for the guy in the basement, since he seems to have finally gotten rid of his forever hanging around ex-wife he has successfully turned into a Deuce Bigolow type of Gigolo with a literal revolving door of females. Apparently I’ve made it to his hit list, for the sheer fact I’m willing to bet, that I have absolutely zero interest.&nbsp;   So without fail for the last month they have knocked on my door more times then in the entire 2 years I have lived here for all sorts of horrendously stupid reasons in an attempt to engage conversation.   If you think I’m being a bitch about this, I’ll confess you’re probably right I am to a degree. However, they are breaking the formally arranged set of boundaries that have been firmly established over a two-year period and it’s pissing me off.   This morning I woke up to a pounding at around 10 am. Normally I would have been bed for hours by that point but since I didn’t get home from the drive-in until about 5am the previous night I was still sleeping. In the nude, might I add, with a clear glass bedroom door that faces my front door with a rather large window on it that is normally covered by a blind that I accidentally forgot to close the previous night in my tiredness? (run-on sentence anyone?)   Whatever, I’m certainly no goddess being an out of shape office worker, but I also have no real sense of forced modesty having lived with so many people in my relatively short life. So I got up, threw on a t-shirt and shorts and answered the door, thinking nothing of it. Of course it would be the basement guy.&nbsp;   Was I sleeping? Fuck no buddy I always lie still as death on my bed, in the morning, nude.   He looked very taken back. I didn’t know you swore like that.   Well I guess I’ve never found ways to insert fuck, into our 5 second hi, how are you, as we pass on the driveway.   So he replies with a smarmy smile, maybe you just woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning, and I couldn’t help but notice, alone.   Did you also happen to notice my unshaved legs, sweaty hair, and I’m sure rather rank morning breath since I ate nachos and cheese at 3 in the morning and neglected to brush my teeth. For crying out loud before you attempt to turn this into the opening act of some cheap B rated porn and queue the bow chicka bow music what the fuck do you want.   Wow, you are feisty.   I gave my best look of death and shut the door in his face. Not a slam, just a firm shut so he was sure to see it coming. For good measure I dropped the deadbolt, and pulled the blind, all while maintaining Medusa inspired eye contact.   He knocked a few times as I poured my cheerios and picked crusty’s from the corners of my eyes.   &nbsp;To be continued with the Louds invasion.

      I have been trying like crazy to get a new job. There’s a certain area that I used to live in that I really would like to move back to, unfortunately because it’s a small city there aren’t a whole heck of a lot of jobs. Suddenly within the past couple of weeks a bunch of jobs popped up, and I’ve been sending in resumes like a mad women and going to a number of interviews. Ironically enough, not one of the jobs is even remotely similar to something I’ve done before, but almost all of them are something feel I could easily do.  &nbsp;  The trick of the interview game is coming off as confidant, knowledgeable but modest enough to be enthusiastic about the fact that the company is even considering you as a potential employee. It’s so silly, and fake, completely not my style. After a few interviews of me smiling nice, asking appropriate questions and carefully responding with informative well thought out answers I began to feel a little frustrated. Do companies really want to hire a puppet complete with strings they unwittingly pull just because they happen to be in the power position?  &nbsp;  I’ve been trying to leave this political BS behind every since I jumped ship on my fast track to the Corporate Kingdom. Do I really want another job that values that type of employee? I’d rather stay where I am now, where I am bored to tears, make good money and have managed to successfully avoid playing inter-office games.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Alas, my last interview on Friday for a job in an area close to where I want to be, I decided to practice the un-interview interview technique. After listening to the HR guy and the Big Boss rattle on outlining the position merits, responsibilities and what the envision the ideal candidate as being, I gave it to them Lindsey style.  &nbsp;  Look, I could detail all my past experiences and accomplishments to my credit in an attempt to wow you with my abilities. Frankly, though you have all that stuff on paper and I’ve provided you a mile long list of references to back it all up. I really would rather take this opportunity to skip the basics that any candidate who has been granted an interview probably has and jump right into why you want to give me this job. The IT I could do in my sleep, dealing with clients I’ve been doing for years, my personal selling points aren’t the requirements I can easily fulfill, it’s the skills I bring that you haven’t even considered….  &nbsp;  And for 7 minutes or so, I gave them my version of the blunt sales pitch.  &nbsp;  When I was done, there were a few moments of silence, where I of course was anticipating getting a perfunctory handshake and a walk out of the building, interview over.&nbsp; However, the Big Boss gave a chuckle and asked if I ever considered a career in sales and for the next half hour I chit chatted with my two new best friends.  &nbsp;  I know they are going to call me back; the only problem is I’m not even sure if I want that job.  &nbsp; Irony.

      I know a flower, people hate pictures of flowers. In my defense, I really don’t take many flower pictures. I just could not resist this particular rose, but I did have trouble deciding which picture I liked the best. Given that it’s my journal, I thought what the hell and posted them all.

      Through fluke and chance my last job was as an Analyst, working with stats in a call centre. The job was 50% report/calculation design and 50% banging my head against the wall trying to explain “call centre” math to every other department. Eventually my head became very sore; enter my new job in the Transportation industry, again as an Analyst but with a completely different twist – mainly less math, hence less explaining.  Today at work my bosses boss was delighted to discovery (by fluke and chance, which seems to rule my life) that I have “call centre” math experience, as their newest project is to run their customer service/sales centre as a mini call centre. So I’m hauled into the boardroom to explain the terminology and head-banging math that comes with a call centre. I started slow.  Weighted Service Level is perhaps the most basic and first measure of a call centre. The idea is to determine the number of calls answered, within specific criteria, the result being your Service Level.   As an example: If 3 calls were answered in 1 hour with a combined Service Level of 100% and 1 call was answered in the next hour with a Service Level of 50%, then your weighted Service Level would be 87.5%.  Instantly I get an argument that the S/L should be 50% from Joe blow in the back. Right I say, if service level was based upon averages, however, that isn’t the case as each call has equal weight to measure true performance. Not upset, or even feeling a bit agitated I start to write the formula on the board. After all, this is simple stuff, plenty of time to pull out my hair.   Joe of course, completely sure of his math didn’t even bother to wait out my explanation. Instead he interrupts me and jumps in with the following: If in the first hour all 3 of the calls had 0% Service Level and in the second hour the only other call had 0% Service Level what would your Weighted S/L be then. With a smug look he waits for my answer, completely sure he’s trumped me.   Of course the part that was killing me is all the upturned faces, swiveling back to look at me, also waiting for my answer and the outcome of our little battle of brains. I swear I could actually begin to feel an ulcer forming to eat away at my innards.   Then out of left field, a voice pipes up. The weighted service level would be 0% Joe, for that matter so would an average service level, because zero percent is zero percent.   And without saying it, we all heard loud and clear the “you fucking idiot” on the end of that sentence.

      I was down at the lake early this morning, wandering about, lost in thought. I have a new student from the shelter that I’m trying to teach computer skills to, totally tough kid, but with almost no formal education. For some reason or other we are just not clicking and we are making almost no progress. I really don’t think it’s either of our faults though. It just doesn’t feel like a teaching style or lack of comprehension issue. I’m convinced the this kid is dead smart and there’s a whole lot going on in that brain, I just can’t get any of it to surface. It’s hard when a kid has been taught that acting dumb makes you tougher, but I admit I have respect for his survival style, it’s worked this long for him.   In typical small world fashion, I ran into a fellow volunteer who was jogging the trail. After leaning against one of the lookout railings idle chit chatting for about ten minutes, Mark happens to mention that he saw my student I was just pondering, being arrested by the cops the previous night. I didn’t even get agitated, just asked what the bust was for (selling) and shook my head. It’s inevitable that he’ll be charged and will probably have to serve some sort of jail time; regardless it’s cause for automatic removal from the program.   My face must have looked pretty final and nonchalant because Mark asked if I was even upset, or if I would try to argue his placement. I won’t because I believe in that particular policy and honestly I just didn’t feel anything at the moment. I said as much to Mark.  “That’s cold Lindsey, man,” as he jogged off.   I just stood there for a while looking out at the water, not really seeing a whole lot. I could have tried to explain myself, but sometimes you just need to draw your line in the sand. From the lookout tower the line may appear to be pretty straight, but when you’re standing on the sand looking down, you can see all the little imperfections, the curves and the bumps. He was right, it was cold, I was cold. You just can’t expect to have perfect control over millions of little grains.

      I love books, all sorts of books from fiction and autobiographies, to textbooks and dictionaries, but I have always had a special place in my heart for children’s books. After all, my love for reading is a direct result of those early well-loved books, so it makes sense that even now I hold a soft spot for that particular genre.  *************************************************************  When I was in my first year of university, a close friend and I were trying to figure out ways to raise money, while still being responsible, socially aware individuals. Eventually we came up with the idea of a company called “Bubbles for Trubbles.” Which basically involved us doing random acts of goodness for people that were simple, yet effective in that they were touching, thoughtful, and would help sooth even the most troubled soul. Our marketing plan was a bit weak on the actual part about making money, but our hearts were in the right place.  *************************************************************  I have a friend who is going through a hard time recently so I thought I would make him a care package to cheer him up.  He is also a lover of all things written, not to mention all things made of sugar and comedies. So I thought I would make him a themed care package. I went to the local bulk food store and bought a massive bag of yellow happy face gumballs, as well as happy face lollipops. Second stop, to rent Happy Gilmore. Finally I headed to the bookstore to pick up a copy of one of my favourite childhood books, Mr Happy. Add a happy face bag and some happy face paper from the dollar store and you have a very cheesie, tongue in happy face cheek care package.  *************************************************************  At the bookstore, I became sidetracked by a collection of Monster poems and found myself hunkered down in the miniature-sized aisles reading. At the end of one particularly amusing poem I laughed out loud, slightly embarrassed I looked up to see if anyone was around me. About 10 feet away a boy and his dad were sitting at a brightly coloured child’s table staring intently at a shared book.  “Yeah dad, like we practiced, F like fffffffffffffast.”  The child was coaching the father, who was struggling through Bob the Builder. *************************************************************  It happens suddenly, washing over you, an intense feeling almost painful where you can’t tell if a little piece of your heart just broke or if a little piece cracked from some prior incident, just mended.

      Ok apparently the doomsayers were right, bronchial pneumonia does come back. I feel like I’ve been through a war and frankly I look it to. I’ve lost weight, I’m pale, there’s huge black circles under my eyes, and I’ve developed this weird tick..   I’m kidding….kinda  Honestly, these past 5 weeks have been pure hell with only a mild break in the middle. If it weren’t for plenty of books, a nearby Timmies and the half naked construction workers working on the house next door (conveniently placed at an excellent vantage angle from my convalescent balcony) I would have thrown myself into the lake.   Enough whinging…   Coming up: comments on books read, late night infomercials, Canada Day, and rotary phones… right after I go make and consume the world’s largest pancake with strawberries.
