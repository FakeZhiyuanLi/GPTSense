      So it started by me reading this Hermawan Kertajaya book that said The World is Filled with People who thinks like a Women. Men and Women now decides using their hearts Not New for Women, but for us guys that's new. It goes a long with that Metrosexual phenomena (which is slowly drifting away from everone's mouth and thoughts)  Men are now has a lot ammount of emotion to handle, to flowaway, to tell and to show. Kertajaya said that is why everymarketing discipline that uses Human Emotions are always a success. He also said that all of the above are the reason why SMS's, E Mails, YM and ICQs are a Huge Hit, suddenly i remember the success of Friendster, Friendtest,  that allows you to express urself in lots of ways. Suddenly we want to know how people think of us (Sesuatu yang menurut gue keprempuanan. Laki laki sih dulu mana peduli... We are an egoisticall bastards)  That is also why products that people sell often gets PERSONALIZED. There's a lot of Characteristics on every business in every products Tiba tiba produk jadi banyak bgt dengan tambahan hal hal yang spesifik seperti susu khusus untuk siapalah, Rokok untuk orang yang doyan apalah, Baju untuk komunitas apalah, Radio utk segmen inilah, banyaklah pokoknya. Look around, its everywhere...  Knowing the fact i begin to use those facts and placed it firmly on both of my work..  HARDROCK FM BANDUNG and REF BASKETBALL INC.  It has to be Personalized and it has to be able to represent what people think. It has to have a message. It has to create a Community of people who has 1 thing in common whatever it might be.           okay       im getting hungry.  Fine i'll stop writing Now

The answer would be my first time speaking in front of public A huge ammount of em Somewhat around 1500 people. In groups with 10-12 people/group It was PASARSENI 2000 and i was talkin to them about the future Im not so sure back then what i said But then again, im not so sure about a lot of things...  Should i continue writing this blog?
