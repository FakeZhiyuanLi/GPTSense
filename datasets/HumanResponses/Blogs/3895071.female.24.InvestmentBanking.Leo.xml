      one of my exes got a tattoo while i was dating him, it was probably the stupidest one i've ever seen.  he wanted superman (big deal, right?).. only he didn't want superman the way everyone else wanted superman.  he wanted the  whole  superman.  he got it.  it looked.. silly.  to be honest, it was one of the poorest attempts at being different that i've ever seen.   "It's like.. instead of saying, 'i like superman', you're saying, 'wow, i really like that super man'."

      (to the crying child who didn't want his mommy to leave to join us at perkins) Lisa:  "Oh, it's ok, honey.. if you let us go, i'll bring you back a giant muffin!" Sarah:  "If i scream and cry next time you leave me, will you promise me a giant muffin, too?"  (when drunk, mixing metaphores like i do) "God, that just drives the nuts outta me!"  (talking about how it's not fair, some of the times she was mad at me in the past..) Lisa:  "Well, i hide it, it's not like anyone would know i'm after that guy.  Plus, it's totally unfair of me to lay claim to all of the good guys i have contact with.. i shouldn't just be putting them on hold." Sarah:  "The back burner.." Lisa:  "Exactly, i shouldn't be putting them on the back burner to simmer, like gravy.  totally unfair of me to hate you over guys no one knows i want.. especially if i'm taken and just keeping them on hold for when i might be single again."

      (should have guessed the truth from the title, methinks.. ah well. Lesson.. learned!)  Had we but world enough, and time, This coyness, lady, were no crime. We would sit down, and think which way To walk, and pass our long love's day. Thou by the Indian Gorges' side Shouldst rubies find; I by the tide Of Humber would complain. I would Love you ten years before the Flood, And you should, if you please, refuse Till the conversion of the Jews. My vegetable love should grow Vaster than empires, and more slow; An hundred years should go to praise Thine eyes, and on they forehead gaze; Two hundred to adore each breast, But thirty thousand to the rest; An age at least to every part, And the last age should show your heart. For, lady, you deserve this state, Nor would I love at lower rate. But at my back I always hear Time's winged chariot hurrying near; And yonder all before us lie Deserts of vast eternity. Thy beauty shall no more be found, Nor in thy marble vault, shall sound My echoing song; then worms shall try That long-preserved virginity, And your quaint honor turn to dust, And into ashes all my lust: The grave's a fine and private place, But none, I think, do there embrace. Now therefore, while the youthful hue Sits on thy skin like morning dew, And while thy willing soul transpires At every pore with instant fires, Now let us sport us while we may, And now like amorous birds of prey, Rather at once our time devour Than languish in his slow-chapped power. Let us roll all our strength and all Our sweetness up into one ball, And tear our pleasures with rough strife Thorough the iron gates of life. Thus, though we cannot make our sun Stand still, yet we will make him run. -Andrew Marvell  (as copied over and sent by the ex-boyfriend whom i was unknown mistress of, along with this note:  "18 May, 2002/Hey there sweet thang -/  Just thinking about you this afternoon.  Having kind of a bad day, but it's all good when I'm thinking about you.  I should just keep on doing that.  Life seems so damn good when I'm with you.  I should just keep on doing that.  Someday../Love You, Steve.", who is now married and father to a child by the girl he turned to when his girlfriend and i, the other woman, discovered the truth about what he was doing to us.)

      remind me to show you.. and tell you why.   why they were good, and why they were bad.  and why it matters, but it  doesn't .  someone made me think of a thing i've said in the past, when i started being with someone new, and i found it difficult to agree with, for the first time ever.  not because i really had anything great to say about the past experiences i've had, but because what i've got now is  so much more , and it really gives me something to compare you to.  there's so much more.. and the fact that i know what it could be like, and  isn't  is just simply astounding.

      that was so odd.  perfect, but odd.  i bet i'm the only one in 50 square miles who's ex was convinced she was a lesbian.. while dating her.  your whole take on that situation was  amazing , and it makes so much sense.   i heard that little change-up in your voice that meant you were trying not to get mad at someone who'd hurt me.  i love you because you got mad, and because you  stifled  it, knowing that i wasn't mad, and it probably wasn't appropriate.  just because he hurt me, you were angry, and that makes me happy (you know, that part of me that's a girl, that part gets happy).  just because i'm willing to learn, and to grow, and to appreciate the way it made me, you decided to hide it from me, and i love you because of that.  you trust me, and my judgement, and that means the world to me.

      what the hell is up with fashion lately?  lisa and i spent an hour going through a TERRIBLE sears catalogue yesterday.. the men's big and tall.. when did dressing like a woman turn cool?  some of these guys were wearing what appeared to be 2-piece moo-moos.  there were FAR too many stars&stripes themes.  v-necks on guys?  ok, that's fine.  v-necks that plunge deeper than anything i'd wear?  not so much.  peasant tops?  i don't think so.  sleeveless is fine, if you're in a wifebeater.  if you're in a vest/shirt/etc.. best be certain it doesn't look TAILORED to be that way, if you want something like that to be something i'll be seen with you in, cut off your own damn sleeves.  or buy it somewhere trendy that makes them look homemade.  call me a hick, but i'll take a wifebeater over a blouse on a man, anyday.  especially if they call it that.  here are some examples (i shit you not!) of the names of colors men are wearing nowdays:  Dusty Jade Salmon Plum Sunflower Lime Turquoise Coral Teal LILAC ROSE MAUVE PERIWINKLE  what ever happened to the names men are supposed to call colors?  like green, blue, red, black.. i mean, where did all this girly crap come from?  to quote myself, "What happened to men's clothing being simple, like men should be."  someone brought to my attention the idea that because women are stealing away all men's glory, they're taking over some of our girly stuff.  sorry, if this is your thing.. but a manicure isn't ever anything i want to hear requested as an anniversary present.  what was the name of those crazy fucking pants from 10+ years ago, with all the colors?  it's eating my brain, not knowing.

      Everyone gathers for the never planned, always varied Sunset Celebration on the Mallory Dock. Once the sun is safely tucked away by jugglers, mimes, musicians and street artists, the city moves to a different beat. A night beat. The streets, filled with urlLink  sidewalk cafes , open-air bars, legendary  urlLink pubs  and world-class  urlLink restaurants  come alive. Gourmets and gourmands alike treat their palates to island specialties.  urlLink Drama ,  urlLink musicals  and  urlLink comedy  flourish on our stages. As you enjoy these sights, you'll discover that modern Key West is a warm-hearted place where all are welcome. The city's vibrant  urlLink Gay and Lesbian Community  helped spearhead the island's economic and social revival in the 1980's.  and i only skimmed, before i pasted it.  this is for me to read tomorrow, when i'm awake and i want..

      i got to get down to some important business that i've been trying to do that for ever , it seems like, and i'm so relieved.&nbsp; i feel accomplished, to the extreme.&nbsp; just good, and relaxed, because i was able to get it off my mind.&nbsp; it'll be great, and it will be ok, because i was able to do that.&nbsp;   god, i was thinking about&nbsp;this, what needed to get done,&nbsp;constantly -&nbsp;at work, when i couldn't do what needed to be done, even&nbsp;-&nbsp;and it frustrated me, to extreme.&nbsp;   but that's all gone now, all i feel is the good again, that utter satisfaction that comes along with being able to do that which has been weighing down your thoughts with it's everpresence.&nbsp; it's good, it's great, it's wonderful.&nbsp; i feel like i need a nap, all the stress is gone.&nbsp;   even if it's only temporary.&nbsp;

      i found this blog by accident, and it makes me smile.&nbsp; i'm not going to tell you whose it is, or where it is, but it really makes me happy to read it, and i think it's great.&nbsp; keep your chin up, you, because it's important.&nbsp; look on the happy, when you smile, your world smiles back.&nbsp; it's very important.&nbsp; i even started a list of rules for my life, because of that thought.&nbsp; they are as follows:   Rule #1 - Smile!   there's this whole   theory  that i haven't really gotten into investigating, not totally, but it&nbsp;links up to stuff&nbsp;like  urlLink this , and this stuff really makes me think hard, because it makes sense to me.&nbsp; i think it's true, and i want to share, because it's what i did.&nbsp; and i'm working on the  have  now, and it's fucking awesome.&nbsp; s'cuse the language.&nbsp; and that makes me want to share it with people who i think deserve to smile, and that includes that person who's blog i've been reading and loving most recently.&nbsp; chin up, and smile, hon.&nbsp;   uh, i guess that's my only rule, so far.&nbsp;   (that second link, i did WITHOUT the aid of that thing i've been using to tell me how to do stuff like that, and i feel really very very smart about it.)

      he's a townie.&nbsp; not forever, not seriously, but a townie staple, nonetheless.&nbsp; everyone recognises him, because he walks the streets.&nbsp; everyone knows someone who knows him, everyone knows someone who he owes something to.&nbsp; mostly money, sometimes recognition.&nbsp; he should know who i am.&nbsp; i remember intimate details about him - he doesn't, about me, and it's not expected, he didn't know much to begin with - but he should remember that i know something about him.  he's the delivery-boy now.. and the people i work with know his not-so-proud nickname.&nbsp; they find it funny, like i do.&nbsp; they think he's a joke, but i know he's not.&nbsp; he's had hard times, like the cafe i used to go to, only with less free rent.&nbsp; we're not going to be surprised if the order doesn't show up someday.&nbsp; he's no-job bob.&nbsp; i'm not the only one in pharmacy who's seen him in compromising positions.&nbsp; megan and i should have been friends long before now.&nbsp;   we've decided that we know each other.&nbsp; we were drunk, or stoned, or both, and it was years ago, but i'm sure we've met before.&nbsp; the crazy part is, we each find each other familiar, and have since day 1, when i started with the company.. but neither of us said anything, for fear that we'd get that contempt that some people have when you bring it up.&nbsp; we're familiar, but we've got no clue where from, which party, who we were with, who's house.&nbsp; it's funny.&nbsp;   she didn't believe it out of me the same way i didn't believe it out of her, because we're both so innocent in appearance.

      (sometime, december, 2003) &nbsp;&nbsp; My car is breaking down. &nbsp;&nbsp; There is a good reason for this: I am a lazy non-mechanic. Actually, that’s the prevailing reason that all of my cars have broken down. That and I have received them ALL at least third hand, from someone who bought them as cheap intermediaries, while their loan was going through (for example).  &nbsp;&nbsp; My car is making a funny noise. A light, high-pitched sort of “ca-chunk, ca-chunk”. It seems to be coming from a fan or vent somewhere in the dashboard directly in front of me. That would be driver’s side, for those of you who are a little slow. The noise probably started a while ago.&nbsp; Chances are, I was playing my radio too loudly to notice it. Or maybe there were other warning signs that I should have noticed, but didn’t. Actually, it’s highly probable that it was BOTH of the above, and that’s why it’s exceptionally hard to tell my dad that there’s something wrong. Well, that and Daylight Savings Time. &nbsp;&nbsp; You see, my dad gets home from work after 4:00 pm, which in Wisconsin, in December, is after dark. If I were to bring up my car problems after dark, they’d be met with an angry look and an exclamation. I like to avoid that combination whenever possible. So I’m waiting for a time when both of us are home, and it’s light out, to tell him. I’d like to wait for him to be in a good mood, but that’s a bit like having my cake and eating it too (or in my case, owning a vehicle, and having it be reliable). &nbsp;&nbsp; Before you say anything, I have to get this in. Yes, I DO know that because I haven’t told him, it’s probably getting worse everyday. Oh, I didn’t mention that I’m still driving it? Well, I have to, to get to work, you see. And asking to use my mom’s car would arise immediate suspicion. But don’t worry, it’s only being driven to necessary destinations. Like work. And McDonalds. Hey, a girl’s gotta eat, you know. &nbsp;&nbsp; Dad has a good reason for the angry face/exclamation. You see, he’s not a mechanic, either. Unfortunately, he happens to be the sort of man who’s really useful in almost all other aspects. He can make incredible things out of wood, he chops wood and mows the lawn for fun, he’s an awesome fix-it man. It’s not his fault that he can’t listen to a car run, and immediately ascertain it’s problem. No one can be Superman in ALL walks of life. &nbsp;&nbsp; So, I think that tomorrow, I’ll tell him about my little problem. During daylight hours. After I buy him some beer. Hopefully, I can limit his reaction to just an exclamation. Or an angry face. So long as it isn’t both. Let’s just hope my car makes it home tonight. And maybe to McDonalds.

      i'm upset, slightly, that no one responded to the post when i asked people to tell me if they read my blog.&nbsp; i shouldn't be, but there's a few reasons behind it.  am i the only one who, when i read someone's blog, i wonder about the other people who read it, and click to see if they've got their own blogs?&nbsp; does that friend of yours, and do the other friends of yours really not care enough about the person you're obviously so taken with, that they aren't checking to see?&nbsp; i want your friends to care.&nbsp; more for your sake, than mine.&nbsp;   if i were them, and you were me, i'd be totally reading up on myself.&nbsp; this doesn't apply to amy (who does, i know) or to you (because i know you read).. but to the other people.&nbsp;   i'm asking you in order to reassure myself that you guys care enough to be reading up on me.&nbsp; whether you like me or not isn't the issue, i just want to know that you're researching, i guess.&nbsp; reassure me that you guys care enough to read what i've got to say?&nbsp;  reply please .&nbsp; you deserve the friends who'll be snooping around for you, because they care.

      the message on mike's voice mail says:   Hi, you've reached Mike.&nbsp; I'm away from my desk right now, but if you leave your name and your number, i'll be sure and get back to you. Thank you.   i'm THOROUGHLY amused by this for several reasons.&nbsp; not the least of which is the idea that he can be away from his "desk" and unable to answer his cell phone.   also, because it reminds me of his old message, the one i used to listen on his answering machine at his house, just to hear his voice.&nbsp; to this day i know it by heart.. "You have reached 7**, nine-three, nine-five.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; Leave a message, and we'll get  right  backtaya."&nbsp; if you want, i can do my impression on the phone.&nbsp;   but his professional manner on the phone really impressed me, always has, it's very polite, and it reminds me of your work-phone-voice.&nbsp;&nbsp; i liked it again when i called, just now.&nbsp; i'm glad you don't use it all the time, though. &nbsp;i only want to hear it when you're working, ok?&nbsp; and that way, too, you'll know that you're completely making me.. anticipation again.

      i remember mike because i see you in mike.&nbsp;   mike, when mike was happy and carefree, was happy and carefree and did crazy things that made everyone i was around cringe sometimes, and made me look at him the way i was looking at him in that picture.&nbsp; he awed me, when he was happy and crazy like that.&nbsp; i loved him for being brave, and for doing stuff that he knew would make people cringe..  because  it would make people cringe.&nbsp;   you're reminiscent of mike in a lot of ways.&nbsp; the way you're willing to do things and not care what people think.&nbsp; the way you're open, and you get along with nearly everyone.&nbsp; the way that people flock to you - yes, i've noticed that - and the way that you find humor in things that people normally don't.&nbsp; you even have a look on your face sometimes that looks like a look mike had on his face sometimes.&nbsp; when i was 17, mike was really truly what i wanted.&nbsp; i yearned for him, because of all those things in him that i see in you.  i longed for mike a lot.. i wanted him to want me, and i spent a long time wishing he would.&nbsp; he just didn't have it in him, though, and i don't blame him for that anymore.&nbsp; that look he used to give?&nbsp; he didn't aim it at me, he aimed it at jakie.&nbsp; but it's ok, now.&nbsp; he's realized it was a waste (which my self-confidence needed before i really forgave him), and i've gotten a good friend from the deal - that's all that really matters.. truely.&nbsp; he helped me to see part of who i wanted to be with, that big part of him that reminds me so much of you.

        &nbsp;one of those songs i loved before i knew it.&nbsp; i loved that i could tell that they were from texas, just from their voices, before i asked, and that someone was impressed that i could tell.&nbsp;   very.. synthesizer.&nbsp; it's cool.&nbsp; like the voice, it's very well put-together.&nbsp; which sounds like a sexual comment.&nbsp; i talk in sex lately.&nbsp; i love that&nbsp;title part, when it gets good.&nbsp; can't explain it well, but i like it a lot.&nbsp; expressive song, i guess.  she's got a cool voice.&nbsp; i like it.  that's exactly the reason i love it, because you used to.  i loved this song from the first second it started.&nbsp; i love that you explain them.&nbsp; i love it how you did it, and it makes me so happy.  hey, i know this song.&nbsp; i like this song.&nbsp; it's one that i never knew the name of.&nbsp; great feeling.   ooh, i really really like this one, too.&nbsp; never heard it before.&nbsp; it's nice, makes me feel sexy.&nbsp; plus, i've always had a spot in my heart for the the bands.&nbsp; just for having a really funny title as a genre of band.&nbsp; love it.  you're right.&nbsp; pretty song.  skipped it for now.  i love the title.&nbsp; great song, you're right.&nbsp; baring the soul of the song - i love that.   i'll comment on the others later, i think, i'm too busy watching you to really listen right now.

      all of a sudden i've got this intense feeling that i could never ever be good enough for someone this perfect, and a secret sort of feeling that  at least i tricked him enough so that i'll get to see him, if nothing else, at least i'll have that little time to see him and feel him and look at him before he realizes what i really am .  i have a feeling my care package isn't sufficient, but also a feeling that you won't think that way, so i guess we'll have to wait and see.&nbsp; i have a tendancy to get flippant on people, so that i can make sure they don't think they're hurting me when they decide they can live without me.&nbsp; there might be some of that involved.&nbsp; hearts hearts hearts.&nbsp;  don't believe me when i get that way, everever .

      that smell - it's like instant tears, but happy. and that feeling, in a can, only not in a can.   i am totally having an affair.&nbsp; on my phone.&nbsp; with a shirt.&nbsp; i'm carrying it around with me, holding it on my shoulder.. only because if i put it on, i won't be able to take it off, and that's just plain.. silly.&nbsp; i took a picture, but it might be too creepy for the rest of you to appreciate - and i only want to share it with one person.&nbsp; only they get to see the me that's that creepy.&nbsp;   i just realized that it's absurd that&nbsp;he thinks that's a  good  thing.&nbsp; in an oh-my-god-please-get-here-now sort of way.

      i thought i was going to go in early today, and talk to karen, but i don't think so anymore.&nbsp;   augie went nuts, as usual, and i heard the most beautiful noise ever.. like a garbage truck, only it leaves stuff, and the stuff isn't garbage.&nbsp; that squeeky noise that means something great is coming.&nbsp; and the man in brown said, "First stop of the day."&nbsp; and i almost cried, because someone paid more, and it worked.  i hope that after i open it, i'll be able to get to work  when i'm scheduled to be there .

      i never really thought this about me, but a relative said it last week (friday, on vacation), and i think it struck a chord.&nbsp; she said something about me being, "just how i remember, you, sarah, never able to sit still," and i think she's right.&nbsp; i'm twitchy, slightly.&nbsp; nervous.&nbsp; always waiting for something to happen, always expecting something, always afraid i'll miss out on it when it does.&nbsp; it's just how i am, and i'm getting excited now, and it's getting worse.   i can't sleep, without aids - usually the boxed variety - and that's something that makes me upset.&nbsp; when i wake up, i can't get back to sleep (when i'm happy, and right now, i'm on-the-verge-of-tears-happy  constantly ), because my mind starts moving, and i can't (or don't want to) stop it.&nbsp; it's so frustrating.&nbsp;   i feel like that donkey.&nbsp; you know, the one that's being made to run so fast for that carrot on the fishing pole (that's how i always saw it as a kid).&nbsp; there's this amazing, wonderful, indescribable thing that's right there, in front of my face, and completely out of my reach.&nbsp; i love it.&nbsp; ten days is for-eh-VER.&nbsp;   but i need an alternative method to falling asleep.&nbsp; yoga, eh?&nbsp; very interesting.

      seeing how sexy other people think that the guy i'm completely in love with would be a bad thing, it'd make me feel jealous, and non-comparitive.&nbsp; for some reason, this is not the case, and i find it terribly amusing.  also, sexy.. other girls wanting him (you) and him (you) only wanting me makes it indescribably sexy.

      i'm going through pictures that make me want to cry.  not because i love them, not because i love her, but because they make me want to be able to feel that for a girl again.. totally unsuspicious.&nbsp; i miss having that sort of girlfriend.&nbsp; it's something she took away from me, by being who she is, and it makes me want to bawl, just because it's so terribly wrong, not only for girlfriends to treat each other like that, but for  people  to treat each other that way.&nbsp;   i'm showing them to him (you), and completely hoping he doesn't find her sexy.&nbsp; impossible to dream about, really, but it might happen.

      my family doesn't close the door when they go to the bathroom.&nbsp; when i say family, i mean my mom, mostly.&nbsp; i've inhereted this unincognito technique to urination (anything heavier than pee, and i DO close the door).&nbsp; it's a side of myself that few people (none, really) have seen, and it's intensely personal, but i love it, because it reminds me of how free my mom is with all of us, and how open i want to be, should i choose to have kids someday.   bear in mind, it took me a while to appreciate it.&nbsp; when i was younger, and even sometimes today, it's a little embarassing.&nbsp; i've got to make damn sure everyone is fully clothed and/or doors are closed before i bring anyone over to visit.&nbsp; it's standard procedure to yell "Hello!?" when i come in the door with a friend.&nbsp; lisa knows, and she makes sure and yells "Knock knock!" when she comes in.&nbsp; [i yell "knock, knock" back, but that's as a running joke from the time she yelled it first, and i meant to reply "Who's there?" and did it wrong.&nbsp; it's been a slight load on my life, that my mom can't keep her door closed in the bathroom.]   Sam had a big issue with the bathroom.&nbsp; it could have been for any number of reasons.. a diffferent background, 2 siblings, strange parents.. but for whatever reason, he not only  always  shut the bathroom door.. he also  always  locked it.&nbsp; it seemed odd to me, because we lived together for 3 years, 2 of which were without roommates other than each other.&nbsp; why on earth would he have to lock the door?&nbsp; i really don't WANT to see him shitting.&nbsp; if he's not in the rest of the apartment (all 3 rooms of it), i'm pretty sure (especially if the door's closed) that i'll be able to discern where he is.&nbsp; it just seemed like a barrier that didn't need to be there, i guess.&nbsp; it made ME self-conscious, and lock the door when i was in there.&nbsp; which was odd, for me.   our bathroom didn't have a lock-mechanism until i was ~14.

      are getting married.&nbsp; they've become re-engaged.&nbsp; i'm counseling mike through the process.&nbsp; not only did he choose her over me, he spent 6 years with her, getting jerked around emotionally, while she was fucking jeff.&nbsp; yes, you heart right.&nbsp; (  [watching you be resourceful is hot in a very masturbatory way, i think, oddly enough.. i have a feeling you're doing the exact same thing that i would be doing, talking to them in exactly the same manner i would, were i on the phones with them.&nbsp; except you've got sway, which is normally hot, goes back to hunter/gatherer times, methinks.&nbsp; nonetheless, very very sexy to see you doing.&nbsp; because i think you're using the techniques i use, and i think that the ones i use are the best, and the idea that you came to the same conclusions on how to treat people to get them to bend to your will is incredibly sexy in a very arrogant way, to me.]  i got a cd one time, from a good friend of mine, from online (actually, 3 cds), and it was amazing, how many of the songs were songs i always wanted to know the name of.. here's a few that i love:&nbsp; there is, prisoner of society, alcohol, good riddance - a live version?, underground, americana, band on every corner, don't you know who i am?, calypso (in the beginning of 10 things i hate about you)   listen up all you crazy insanos who read my blog and don't comment EVER adore  feedback, tell me if you love me, or if you hate me, and why, if you're so inclined.&nbsp; also, tell me how often you check back, i am just arrogant enough to want to know all the details about you - so long as they pertain to myself.  i've got a visitor coming, and i could literally bust/melt with anticipation.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      this is what i woke up to, on the counter:   Sarah - I left for vacation with the kitchen cleaned up.&nbsp; All I asked was for you to Keep it that way & to unload the washer.  And I can't get near the computer - please clean that area up.&nbsp; You know i'll do the kitchen.&nbsp; as always.   Holy Passive Aggressive, Batman!&nbsp;   so then when my dad came in, and said something about me trying to do something in the kitchen before work, of course i cut him off - "I KNOW, dad".&nbsp; and then i felt bad, and tried to explain, but i think i made it worse, cause it hurt me too much to say without showing that hurt, "i went to bed last night thinking, 'wow, this is great, they got back from vacation and no one had anything to yell at me about', and then i wake up to this..." and i almost cried.&nbsp; and then i said i was sorry too many times, and he understood, but didn't have anything he could say, so he just left.&nbsp; now everyone feels shitty, and i feel like it's my fault.   on the upside, it seems like the sloppier i get - read&nbsp;glass post below - the more i'm adored.&nbsp; a girl could get used to this.. scratch that.&nbsp; i don't think anyone could ever get used to this feeling.&nbsp; in a very very  very  nice way.

      or Get Thee Back Satan, From Whence Ye Came!  ok, so i went outside today, to go to the store, and Oneandthesame called me over.&nbsp; she'd heard more about who the bitchy-note-leavers might be, and she wanted to share.&nbsp;   apparently the people across the street (not the drug-dealers, the other ones, on the corner) called the cops on the people next door (on the other side) of the drug-dealers.&nbsp; they used to have 2 dogs, beagle-mixes.. and because the people on the corner called the cops 5 times, they were taken away and put to sleep.&nbsp; it makes me sick.&nbsp; here's something MORE sick, if you can stomach it.  they also used to have a cat.&nbsp; the cat (like most of the neighborhood cats) roamed the streets, generally just being a mouse-catcher for the neighborhood.&nbsp; they're all good cats, they run away from you if you get too close, etc.&nbsp; the closest i've ever come to seeing one up close was one time when one of them was sleeping on top of mom's minivan.&nbsp; but i digress.  this cat was apparently caught sleeping in the NeighborsFromHell's flowerbed.&nbsp; they  killed  it,  tied a note around it's neck  explaining that it had been sleeping in their flowers, and that this is  what happened to cats who roamed free to sleep in flowerbeds , and then they.. cover your eyes, it gets even  worse .. then they  threw it over the fence  where the  children  found it..  eventually .  needless to say, i'm feeling very grateful that all they did was leave a note.. i've seen some horrible emergency vets dealing with rat poison.&nbsp; i just never thought people like that  actually  existed.&nbsp; Ready to Rumble indeed.

      it's a phobia.&nbsp; i'm not sure where it stems from, it's not all big cities.&nbsp; just chicago.&nbsp; it's so big and in the middle of the cold and it doesn't really seem like there should be any good reason for loads of people to want to live there (sorry, amy).&nbsp; it makes me scared, because even though it's freezing cold and there's a big amount of murder, you've got to toss coins into booths to get there.&nbsp; like you're paying to get to this cold, scary place that no one really should want to be in to begin with.&nbsp; it's irrational, i know that.&nbsp;   i'd worry more about the pet hair that i'll be bringing with me, than the stuff i'll be taking home.&nbsp; not that i'm terribly hard to find, but how on earth did you do it?&nbsp; i really want to know the process.. did you search for me under "sloppy"?&nbsp;   speaking (typing) of which.. i love the fact that because i like beer and i don't mind the 4-5 hour thing, i'm perfect.&nbsp; you should see my oksummary, it's VERY non-flattery.&nbsp; let me show you..:&nbsp; less organized/sloppier/less ambitious/more extroverted/cruder.&nbsp; these are the definitions they came up with, after i went through scads of questions about every intimate personal detail imaginable.&nbsp; i'm crude and sloppy and lazy.&nbsp; that's pretty much what it boils down to.&nbsp; i can't believe someone thinks that because of that, i'm wonderful.&nbsp; life is beautiful.

      if you're going to have one, don't get the kind you always used to get, get the more expensive, tree-ripe kind, because they're sweet and wonderful, and they taste like honey.. only fuzzier.&nbsp;   why is it that everything i say sounds like sex?

      i was just rinsing off my dishes from the week, thinking.. and i had a sort of a great thought.&nbsp; in a past relationship, i was expected to be the dishes AND the laundry doer.&nbsp; that seemed hideously unfair.&nbsp; in the future, i hope i don't have to be either, that it can be split up.&nbsp; also, if i'm expected to be any sort of a dishes-doer, we rinse our dishes.&nbsp; nothing quite grosses me out the way that the floaties in the sink do.&nbsp; not that i won't do it, if they're not rinsed, but don't expect me to do it all the way through, and there's definately going to be some gagging.&nbsp; but if you don't mind that..  actually, a good sort of all-encompassing rule:&nbsp;   When i'm gagging, i'm not having fun.&nbsp; Please care that i'm not having fun.&nbsp;   thank you.

      i'm pretty sure that.. yep, positive that last night, i was drinking from my wine glass, and the webcam (which rests in a shot glass to keep it upright) fell over..&nbsp; no biggie, really, but the shot glass fell over too, and lodged itself into my wine glass.&nbsp; i thought i heard a splinter, but wasn't sure (read:&nbsp; drunk enough not to see for myself).&nbsp; eventually found the HUGE crack in the glass, drank anyways.&nbsp; to the bottom.&nbsp; spat out the chips of solid that were in the bottom of the glass (2).&nbsp; wonderful.  if i die of internal bleeding, feel free to call my mom and tell her why..

      Test your alcohol knowledge. This will tell you how smart of a drinker you are, and if you can hold your own at a bar, restaurant or other situation involving alcoholic beverages.   urlLink http://www.okcupid.com/tests/take?testid=16336235046633759176   Congradulations! You're 159 proof!  All right. No more messing around. Your knowledge of alcohol is so high that you have drinking and getting plastered down to a science. Sure, you could get wasted drinking beer, but who needs all those trips to the bathroom? You head straight for the bar and pick up that which is most efficient.  (and i took it drunk.)

This does not mean they are more intelligent than anyone else but are generally well rounded and informed. They are good communicators. Most have a good grasp of the language and generally know a little something about everything. They have good personalities and are easy to get to know. They are what the philosophers called seers or priests. These are mentally inclined people. They actively acquire knowledge through experience, education and association. In ancient times, the only educated people were either priests, royalty or those who took it upon themselves to acquire knowledge (seers). The Air signs are curious, have initiative, are original, generally are well-disciplined and are quick thinkers. They rationalize by thinking things out rather than being influenced by emotional or physical factors. They enjoy any type of entertainment where they can use their intellectual capacity and their ability to think quickly and accurately often gives them the upper hand. These people have a tendency to judge themselves very harshly. They have certain standards they set for themselves such as hygiene, the way they dress, education, job performance and family. When angered they resort to trickery. These people are crafty, under handed and ingenious when it comes to evil. They are also prone to physical violence.

      he stole it from someone else, before i did;&nbsp; it was hot property before i posted it:   Last week, we took some friends out to a new restaurant, and noticed that the waiter who took our order carried a spoon in his shirt pocket. It seemed a little strange. When the busboy brought our water and utensils,I noticed he also had a spoon in his shirt pocket. Then I looked around andsaw that all the staff had spoons in their pockets.When the waiter came back to serve our soup I asked, "Why the spoon?" "Well," he explained, "the restaurant's owners hired Andersen Consulting to revamp all our processes. After several months of analysis, they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped utensil. It represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. If our personnel arebetter prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift."As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he was able to replace it with his spare. "I'll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now."I was impressed.   I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter's fly. Looking around, I noticed that all the waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. So before he walked off, I asked the waiter, "Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?" "Oh, certainly!" Then he lowered his voice. "Not everyone is so observant. That consulting firm I mentioned also found out that we can save time in the restroom. By tying this string to the tip of you know what, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the restroom by 76.39 percent." "After you get it out, how do you put it back?"   "Well," he whispered, "I don't know about the others, but I use the spoon."

      funny.&nbsp; someone just made me think of something, and i don't know if i can explain it correctly.&nbsp; every time i've broken up with someone, i've tried, honestly, to keep things simple, and explain to them exactly my reasnoing, and have a good relationship with them.&nbsp; well, except for jeff.&nbsp; the fucker.&nbsp; but other than him, i've really wanted to avoid hard feelings and contempt.&nbsp; just because i don't like to lose people.&nbsp; i like to keep people around, people i've shared time and bits of my life with.&nbsp;   on the same level, though, the reason i was breaking up with everyone was because they didn't understand me, they didn't get me.&nbsp; we didn't have that connection, that thing that makes it so easy to stay together.&nbsp; it didn't end the way i wanted it to, my relationships and explanations were never quite what they needed to be.. things weren't pretty.&nbsp; and vice-versa.. they never gave me what i needed to feel whole again, or good again, after the split.&nbsp; it was all very painful and horrible, really.&nbsp; i'm surprised i made it past 19.&nbsp;   i read something tonight that made me feel ok.&nbsp; if i'd have ever read that, or heard it, i might have been a little more prepared to deal with seperating.&nbsp; but i didn't.&nbsp; maybe because that is the perfect thing for me to hear when it happens, even though i don't ever want to hear it - and deep down, it doesn't scare me, i don't think i will - but if i do, it won't be terrible.  the people who will tell you the perfect things when they leave you aren't the ones who will, and that's a shame.&nbsp;

      i look at that damn table every single day.&nbsp; i walk past it 4 times a day, and when no one is watching, i touch it.&nbsp; i love this table.&nbsp; this table represents what i don't have (my own place) and it tells me, reminds me every day.. the day i am able to live on my own and have my own table, will be just too late.  i have no doubt in my mind that the day i need a kitchen table will be the day after the last of these tables is taken off the market.&nbsp; and then i'll spend the rest of my life trying to find a table i like as much as i like this one.. i'll find close, but they'll never quite be..  right .&nbsp; this is my Amy of a table.&nbsp; i'll be chasing it forever.

      used to mean sleeping in tents, on the floor of the tent.&nbsp; hopefully having the tent in a semi-rockless area.&nbsp; with a blanket, if you were lucky.&nbsp; maybe a sweatshirt for a pillow, cause you forgot yours.&nbsp; you woke up early, too too early, and couldn't get back to sleep because the waves lapping at the shore were waking up those last 3 beers in your bladder and making it impossible to sleep without wetting your "bed".&nbsp; jamie and i were talking today about how what they do now isn't really *really* camping, and talking about all the hardships, and we realized where it was going, and we laughed and turned it&nbsp;into, "And we had to walk TWO MILES to the liquor store.. uphill, both ways!!"&nbsp; just beautiful.&nbsp;   if you were a kid, you'd spend your days wandering, hunting crabs, or riding your bike around the campsites, making friends with people based on the most important aspect of friendship when you're 8 - age.&nbsp; your mom and her cousins would lay on their rafts on the lake all day, and you'd swim, off and on, and wonder how they could sit there all day, when there were so many fun things to do.&nbsp; when you were hungry, you wandered, and one of the campsites was cooking something, and they fed you.&nbsp; you didn't miss TV, or the radio.. actually, when you got back home, the world seemed much to noisy.&nbsp; the air was clean, and tasted like sunshine, and you wished you could be there forever.  i was up until late last night, woke up at 7:30 this morning, and went swimming in the most gorgeous water i've ever seen.&nbsp; walking back along the beach through the water when the world was still asleep was something i hope i carry with me always.&nbsp; the water making soft noises as i displaced it, watching my feet dance in the sunshine dappling down through the crystal clear waters on the sandy bottom.. and hearing the world wake up around me.&nbsp; only one thing was missing, and i hope words aren't all he has to go by forever.  Great quotes from today: "And we all just had a lot in common.. we all liked to go to the bars, and drink.. a LOT." "Oh, mom's not that skinny, she sucks it in.. a LOT." "Did you  want  to see fast?"

      so burnt, so very very hot and red and chilly all at once.&nbsp; drinking water, like a wise person told me to do.&nbsp; after not drinking water, somewhat on purpose, just because i'm stubborn, and don't like to do things that people suggest i do.&nbsp; i challenge them, and don't do it, and almost pass out at the bar, and then end up calling them on my way home from upnorth, and dragging them away from their friends at the bar who are supposed to be avoiding exes (sorry cam!).&nbsp; i'm stubborn; i know that bruce is right, and that he's smart, and that he knows what he's talking about, but sometimes, even that isn't enough for me to listen.&nbsp; sometimes, even being completely totally in love with someone isn't enough to make me listen to their common sense.&nbsp; just because they suggested i do it, i refuse to.&nbsp; i'm drinking water now.

      when i was younger, like.. 11, i formulated the perfect idea of heaven.&nbsp; it was one where everyone had a different place they went to, the place where everything was perfect to them, when they were alive.&nbsp; as much as most people don't like to think things are ever perfect, they're wrong.&nbsp; everyone has a perfect place, and when they go to heaven (the heaven i want to go to) that place is made even better - because it's pure perfect.   when i go to my definition of heaven, it will be the place i went to last night.&nbsp; my car won't break down twice, on the way there, but if it does, it's not a big deal.&nbsp; two guys vying for my attention might just fix it for me, collectively.&nbsp;   notes for the day:   - check fluids in car.&nbsp; remember where transmission fluid goes (behind engine).&nbsp;  - weird that now that you're seeing yourself as acceptably sexual, you notice other people more often, looking at you in a sexual manner.&nbsp; slightly gross, isn't it?  - sleeping in a tent is better than sleeping in a camper, always.&nbsp;  - calling someone collect isn't as scary as it seems.&nbsp;  - always have a friend with a speed boat, never own one yourself.&nbsp; pain in the ass. - speedboats should be brown with orange sparkles.&nbsp; any one i own will be, anyway. - the kids look at me like i looked at mom's cousins.. i need to spend more time with them. - feeling your skin get slightly too tight when you're in the sun is wonderful and horrible, all at once. - sunburn isn't as unpleasant as everyone would make you think.   i hope my pictures turned out, so i can show you some of the wonderful things..

      maybe it's a good thing.  i really doubt that, given the chance to hear this guy in person, i'd willingly fall asleep.&nbsp; waiting until it's impossible to do anything BUT fall asleep isn't always reasonable.&nbsp; i am so interested, and amazed, with every single thing he has to say, that i never want to fall asleep.  at the same time, talking to him makes me so comfortable, i feel so at ease, so content, that i usually can't help but feel sleepy, mmmm...  and then there's the fact that everything he says is so damn  interesting .. we have the most interesting conversations.&nbsp; very engaging, but a just-as-good-word is captivating.&nbsp; he's extremely captivating, and i don't know how i could ever live without him.&nbsp;   he told me a story today, and i wanted to cry, but it showed his peaceful side.&nbsp;

      i remember learning about the impressionists in 9th grade.&nbsp; what i remember loving about them was the stories behind them, so romantic and heartfelt.&nbsp; beautiful people who did what they loved (and some of whom were completely bonkers).&nbsp; i love those types of people.&nbsp;   i remember the thought striking me, when i was learning about monet (he's the one with the bad eyesight, right?) and the paintings&nbsp;that he&nbsp;did when he was old, and almost blind, of the pond, and the water lillies.. remember wondering if he was really doing impressionism, or realism.&nbsp; if he was painting it exactly as he saw it, could it really be impressionism?&nbsp; maybe to him, with his bad vision, it was a perfect photograph of what he saw?   that thought was one of those thoughts that you don't ever really get to find out about, but that makes you feel good wondering.&nbsp; i guess that's why i like monet so much.

      my cousin michelle does it.  i always thought she did it too much.. then i realized i was jealous, and that it was something i wished i could do, the same way she does it.. without really thinking.  then, all of a sudden, a few months ago.. i realized i do it in the same manner as she does.  i wink without second thought.   it's an odd gesture.  it's intimate, without much effort.  people don't know how to take it, sometimes.  they're not sure how to react, when you out-with-a.. especially when you do it without realizing it.. they don't always know that that's the case, and sometimes, they take it too far.  i'm glad you don't.  i wink at people i don't know from adam (who is adam?!?).  i wink because i have an inside joke with myself, or with you, and because i want you to know i'm aware of the funny thing that's just happened.  i wink because i want you to know that i'm aware of things, that i'm aware that things might be taken differently than the context, or to let you know that i'm fully aware of the idiosyncracies that are occurring.  i wink to let you know that you're not alone.  this goes for everyone.  i wink at everyone, to let them know that they're not alone.   some people look at me the way i used to look at michelle.  they see me, and my winking eye, and they don't think that i have any right to be using such an intimate gesture on them.  and you know what?  it doesn't bother me, when they look at me with that look.  because i used to have it, and i know where it comes from.  maybe, in a few months, they'll realize that they're winking subconsciously, too.  maybe even give me the credit for it.  that's a happy thought.

       i need to put these in a good order of importance, can you all help me out?       pay my dad for the car that i've got, that i can't use yet, because i haven't paid for it yet.  get it registered in my name, work things out so i have more reliable transportation.  ~$700   get a woman doctor.  not a female physician.  you get it.  pay all my (loads) of bills, on time, and get things taken care of.  hard, so hard to do.  harder still, when you're like me, and you tend to put them behind the other stuff on the desk, because it makes you frustrated and want to cry.  forgetting is  not  the most effective way to deal with debt.  digital camera, want to show you more things, that's most cost-efficient in the long run.    get my own phone line, and a phone that's speaker-equipped.  for my bedroom.  like i had when i was 16, i need it again.  love it.  pay the sprint bill ($700 dollars worth of minutes in a month?!?)  get goose with golden egg capability.  thought:  maybe money-growing-tree would be more efficient, long-termily.  though, harder to hide a tree than a goose.  money-growing-houseplant?

      some people, i've noticed, are not people (regardless of how wonderful they are, and how much you love them) that you could ever be with.  it's good, when you realize this swiftly.  it's been bad for me (and i'm sure for others of you) when you didn't.  when i was in high school, there was a guy, Casey, who was one of my best friends.  i adored him, adored his family, loved spending time with him.. he didn't always take it the way i sent it to him.  i know, it was sad.  i had/have nothing but love for him, but i can't stand to be his friend anymore.  this isn't the way things should be.   ever .   life is so much simpler now.. not only am i not stressed about trying to convince casey that i really do love him, just  not in that way .. it's truly a shame that it all came at the expense of our entire friendship.  were it to happen now, it would be completely different.   for one, i know the true value of a friend.  i know the expense, and it doesn't bother me  at all .  friends are priceless, and i know that now.  for two, i am not as insecure as i was in high school, and there is no way i would take being shit on (like i was, for not dating casey.. even though i had a great reason  not  to), like i was shit on.  it makes no sense, and i'm secure enough to say "FUCK YOU" to anyone who should hint at making me feel less-than-good about not being with someone i didn't want to be with.  besides, i was my usual self, and i let him down as gently as i could, while remaining firm.  it's just how i am, and everyone who is like that will understand, and agree.  i hope they do the same for the whole situation.  i respect any/everyone who doesn't go with what's easiest just because.. well, it's easier that way.  i hope that all of the people who  really know me  respect me, as well.  i further hope.. i further hope that none of them feel bad, for doing what's right for them, either.  i would expect nothing different from those i call  friend .  i don't say that lightly, and you all know that.  goodnight.

      have you ever gotten that panic? the kind when you change something on your blog, and all of a sudden can't remember what the thing before that was? i'm stopping that, right now.  from now on, should i decide to change anything, i'm going to make sure i post what it *used* to be, so that i don't ever forget. those things that defined my blog were important - very much so - at the time. i don't want to forget them..  that's my gem of wisdom for the eve. be well, and take good care. also, know that i'd have been an  awesome  hippy, but i was meant for now, when hippies are few and far between. when i could reach more people. everything is wonderful. i love life. how could you  not ?  i hope jessica doesn't stress out trying to keep up, on monday. i think i'll like her, very much, and i want her to reply to my posts, because she's fucking awesome, to be frank (WHO IS FRANK?)  last post of the night. sleep well, i love you all.

      we were having a discussion, wherein i said something about everyone around us going in a certain direction, and how i felt vaguely upset about following them - told her i felt like i was in an after school special (you know, the one where they lecture everyone by saying, "If everybody else jumped off a cliff...").. but only because we were going in that direction  specifically because  we figured that it must lead somewhere, everyone else was going that way..  so i got about to the point in my explanation of the disquiet feeling i was having where i said, "If everybody else jumped off a cliff.." and lisa said, "I always  hated  that.  i probably  would  jump off the fucking cliff.  if  everyone else  is thinking it's the best option, i'd be hard-pressed to sit and deduce for myself that it's time to jump.  Also, if I'm going to be the only one in the  whole world  that didn't jump.. I'm the only survivor of the lemming-debaucle?  That would totally suck.  I think I'll jump, when the time comes."  she's got a very valid point.   i'm sure i'd have to question what all the comotion was about, before i took the plunge.. and i might die a very painful death as a result.

      the blog has been irritating me today.. seems like nothing is going quite the way i want it to, and i can't figure out why.  spazzing out on me.  grr.   i wanted to tell you guys about some things that made me laugh, and one more thing that really really made me laugh, when i remembered it (thanks bruce, for reminding me!  even if you didn't mean to).   now i just forgot what it was that i remembered, because i was busy gushing about how it was great to remember.  Princess B, i totally (totally!) sympathize with your feeling old, when you're not.  ditto, chica.  also, if you read this (not sure if you do or not, you've never commented.. if you do, feel free to comment!), i wanted to ask you how you type and put audio in the same post the way that you do - i want to be able to do that!  .......  it'll come back to me, i know.. just give me a minute to think...

       i didn't actually get any porn.. let it be known.. "Sometimes, you're even too drunk for porn."     Jeff: Sarge, mr school. we had a good time, he flirted with me, and i turned him down. not because he's old, because i'd risk the wrath of kelly. that made him pleased. i'm happy to make him pleased.  Brian: said hi, mom told me his wifey-to-be is preggers. not good, but i hope he doesn't let things limit him. he deserves so much, i hope he doesn't let himself get any less than he's worth. i told him that, but i'm not sure how it came out, i was pretty wasted at that point. it was done well, i know that - it's not the method of delivery that i'm concerned about, it's the message itself.  Justin: had a good time. got wasted. satisfied my mommy instinct that i get, after bar close. he let me baby him on the ride home, it was very very nice. good to be able to do that, and not have the guy assume i'll be sleeping with him afterwards. although... but that's something i'll get to later on.  Robby: was amazing. we danced, we cavorted. it was so great. best little brother EVER.  Sarah (not me): wonderful girl, beautiful. so great. why do girls who are that gorgeous think they're ugly and fat? that's INSANE. i hope she goes far, too. or at least gets what she wants. i hope she calls me, too.. i gave her my number. vaguely remember that much.  Rich: let my brother steal his hat. robby's new prized posession. not for the hat, but for the story. it's a wonderful thing.  Mark: voted class clown of his graduating class (along with Sarah - haha! i found me a good croud last night, i surely did). danced with me, and i let him. "Paradise by the Dashboard Lights" will always remind me, now. it was a great time. i waited until the song was over before i told him i was seeing someone. i wanted that little bit of time, because it was wonderful - great times - but i wanted to let him know he'd best be focussing elsewhere, afterwards. didn't want him wasting his energy on me, there were more willing pieces of ass around. that one song was great, though. i hope we can be friends. (even if it might mean he'll keep trying to convince me to "Go home with me, it'll be ok. nothing will happen.. i've got lots of couches, you two (the sarahs!) can just hang out. it'll be fun."  i love how any guy i'm even slightly attracted to, i can see instantly that the reason for my attraction is a part of them that reminds me of you. i love that you'll read this and be ok, because there's no reason to worry, baby, never. things are good, and i know you know i wouldn't let things go.. there's a line, and it's very well defined. i hope you realize that.   Sarah (me, this time!): drunk, totally drunk. having such a wonderful time, it'd be hard to describe it. it's the sort of time you'll remember forever, and now i will. it's a great great thing, and i love it. yay, me! got to baby justin on the ride home, as he fell asleep on my shoulder. crawled into bed with mom, then woke up to go pee.. ended up in bed between my brother and justin (LOL!) somehow. i don't remember any of it, it's all hearsay, as far as i'm concerned. justin DID inform me that when i plopped into bed with the two of them, i kept shaking him awake, and saying, "Bruce! (mumblemumblemumble).. "  i was telling you stories in my drunken-stupor-sleep, B. my drunken brain couldn't comprehend that you weren't there, either on the phone or right next to me, and i wanted to talk to you as i fell asleep. i don't remember any of it, but it made me happy, to hear it, and i hope it makes you happy, too.

        Disclaimer:   i didn't actually eat any porn. i thought a lot about it, but it didn't actually happen. i really really wanted to, but i didn't. sometimes, you're too drunk for porn. and yes, i stole this from jessica.       here's what i remember...      we got there, me, my brother, justin, and my mom. we started drinking. i saw that girl who i thought was alyssa, and then i said, "Wait a minute, that's not alyssa, that's rachel, and she's my friend!" and went over to say hi. when i was talking to her, dwight came up, grabbed her by the arm, and wanted to haul her off to dance. i butted in, said, "Who are you grabbing, Mister?" and he changed grab-ee's as quick as you'd like. it was good. but i didn't want to dance (yet), so i begged off.       saw brian, and said hi. didn't make too much contact, i know his wifey (whom he hasn't married quite yet) gets jealous for no good reason, and i wasn't drunk enough to  try  to provoke her (yet). went back and told mom, and she said, "OHHH, i've got some bad news... well, good and bad..." i said, "Oh, she's pregnant?" mom said yes, but that the good news was that kelly's gonna be a gramma. LOL. kelly is a thorn and a stick all rolled up in one blond, offensive package. (that saying stolen from LISA, who mixed her metaphors beautifully on one good ol' monday night drunk.)      went to the dance floor to find dwight (whom we were calling duane all night, cause it makes him upset.. lol). i've known him since i was born, he's my mom's age. he used to go out with my mom's cousin, jamie. we've always had a sort of a bond.. he's a good guy. i'll show you a picture, when they get developed. i met him on the floor - the band was AWESOME. all the good oldies? they covered them. and did it WELL. so i came up, and started dancing, and realized he was dancing with some other girl. i totally cut in, and it was hillarious. he looks at her, all alarmed, and says, "It's ok, she's my niece!!!" i'm not, but we've decided that i'm  practically , so i bonded with him over it. also bonded with a girl named holly, once we figured out that we're both his "nieces".. related by air, through our perverted uncle. that was great.      robby wanted to dance, so i led him to the floor.. ran into brian, on the way. just tapped him, and said, "Hey! Congradulations!", which made him smile. that was nice.      bonded more with sarge.. he's pleased that i sent a shirt to advertise down in missouri. the idea was enough to make him totally pleased. told him i might need to borrow a sweatshirt to wear, later on in the night, he said, "Well, you could always just come stand by me.. i'll help you keep things heated up." when i didn't seem entirely impressed (teasing, of course!), he looked a little forlorn, said, "Well, it used to work, before i was 150 years old.." to which i replied, "It might still.. but you know, i know kelly.. and i don't really want to risk the wrath." big guffaws ensued. it was great.      got pictures with my favorite peoples at the bar.. it was good, i'll share, once they're developed.       after this, the night gets a little fuzzy. i do know that justin satisfied my need to mommy the drunks, by letting me baby him on the ride home. and today, it continued :). he's a good shit, i'm glad he's now my friend, too. robby can't keep all the good ones all to himself. there's more, but this post is already too long.

      i remember learning some things, making some discoveries that were wonderful, in that they were knowlege and i am always happy to recieve new knowlege.. but horrible, that the things were really real, that they actually existed.  here are a few examples:  vampire bats (because i thought they were nightmare things, but they turned out to be real)  bedbugs (because they have that cheery sounding bedtime saying, and it's not at all as cheery in real life)  there are more, but these are my examples that i was able to give in this 3 minutes of my time.  tell me about yours!  what is great to know, because you know, but bad, and evil because of it, too?  another fine example!:  ring around the rosie.  for obvious reasons.

       sometimes, it's almost too much.  sometimes that overwhelming feeling, the panic because i'm so far gone, and want everything to happen, all at the same time, is enough to make me literally feel like i'm about to explode.  sometimes, i just want to  make you a part of me , because i'm so very much in love.  sometimes.      then i take a deep breath, and remind myself that there's  so much time .  so very much time.  time enough for everything, it doesn't all have to happen all at once.  i have to remind myself of that a  lot , but i think it's because it's all so very wonderful.  it's all so much like a movie.      who am i kidding?  it's almost too much all of the time.  it's always almost too much, and the reminder is always constant.        it's ok, though.. it's all going to be ok.  there's all the time in the world to make sure that everything goes ok.  and it will, even without my constant supervision.  they have so far.. too arrogant of me, to think that they'll all go to hell when i turn my       god i hope it all doesn't disappear one day.. i hope i don't wake up tomorrow with you gone..       deep breaths.. i love you.  it's going to be ok.

      but i think you're officially part of the family, now.   best do lots of research, quickly.   depending on how you take the news, the research could be about how to disconnect yourself completely, or get up here asap.  i couldn't really blame you for the former, but i really really hope you want the latter.

      for later:  sam and weight                  motivation and myself  for now:  we're going to green bay, just as soon as mom gets back from doing laundry.  robby comes home with mountains of it, and she's figured out that it all goes much faster if she just takes it to the 'mat, and does it all, all at once.  beats tying up our machines all freaking weekend long.  i need new jeans.  tell lisa that mom wishes she was working today, because melissa sucks.  lisa will love hearing it.   drunk dialing is evil.  teach robby that lesson, before he learns it the hard way.  16 drunken phone calls last night.  he just counted.  poor robby.  more importantly:  poor robby's friends.   i hope you had a good talk with my mom.  i hope you understood her.  she was wasted.  comes when you drink soco from the bottle.  she finished off half the bottle.  wait, i think robby was taking shots, too.  i quit, though.. right?  i think i did.

       "A generic drug is a copy that is the same as the brand-name drug in dosage, safety, strength, how it is taken, quality, performance and intended use. Generics have the same active ingredients as the brand-name and work the same way in the body in the same amount of time. The only differences between generics and their brand-name counterparts is that generics are less expensive and may look different. Generics are less expensive because generic manufacturers don’t have to invest large sums of money to invent a drug. The drug has already been invented by the brand-name company. Where the brand-name patent expires, generic companies can copy the drug and sell it at substantial discounts. Generics look different than their brand-name counterparts (eg. the pill may have a different shape or color) because trademark laws do not allow a generic to look exactly like the brand-name drug."

      i have an urge, after reading some of the pseudo-political, neo-liberal papers i found in milwaukee, to move there.  they've got advertisements for food places, music places, fun things to do galore.  but then i think about things, for real, and realize that maybe what i really like is being connected.  i feel so alive right now, maybe all i want is to feel like everyone around me is that alive too.. and that's something i don't need to be in a big city to find.   also, some of the things that make me feel *most* alive are the things that i wouldn't notice, were i in that big city.  the sky, for instance, the night sky tonight, on our drive back, was beautiful.  the sight of it, unobstructed by big buildings, was amazing.  the after-sunset colors were a literal rainbow - Robby pointed that out to me.   and being around so many people - while inviggorating, is also depressing.  here, i feel like i make a difference.  big cities are WONDERFUL, and i love to  visit  them.  i think green bay or appleton is a fine example of how big of a town i could actually stand to live in, and still feel like myself.  or neenah.. i've always loved neenah.

      mom bought toilet paper!   "even dad was whining, and that's  sad ."  we're on our way to milwaukee - picking up the little (big) brother, things are good.  i sort of wish i was shopping for kitchen floors, instead, but oh well.. can't do everything all the time.  it'll be good to see him, i can't wait.  he didn't believe the "Oh, just... around." lie.  we'll have to convince him, soon, or he'll be all creeped out by the whole thing..  tomorrow is the corn roast.  Mmmmm, corn (and beer)!  things this weekend will be great, i can't wait.  wish i could bring you with me, i know you'd enjoy it.  the Schoolhouse is  definately  something i want you to see, and i really hope it happens fairly soon.  there's a whole set of places around there that mean a lot, and it gives me a headache to think of all that i want to show you, and didn't get a chance to.  i just have to learn to breathe, and to realize that we've got so much time.. it's all going to be ok.

      DJ:  the asshole whom i was nice to, who has cancer and gets cranky because he's going to die soon.. he might get cranky, but i know he's not cranky at me, he's cranky at life, and his hand.  he was dealt something short of what he's worth, and that's what makes him bitter.  plus, he always has a smile for me, of some sorts.  i like him, he's the first  really cranky  customer who told me why, and actually had a good reason.  Betty:  she's on radiation, and she's tired all the time.  i understand, just because i took the time to talk to her, why she's so tired, and she likes me, because i did something so small as to  listen , the last time she came in.  hang in there, betty!  Tevelen Lady:  she was cranky with the other girls.. but then, when she saw me, she brightened, and told me i deserved a raise.. i told her to take it up with management.  she said she definately would.  i love her because i know she's cranky by nature, but on the same token.. she likes me because she believes that i'm doing my very very best.   DDAVP:  because no matter how pissy he is with anyone else, i only have to get on the phone, and he'll do whatever i say.  because he responds to my sympathetic technique, and because he appreciates that i remember him, always.  that's something - people who actually appreciate what most people take for granted are rare, and they deserve for me to treat them specially.  Mrs. B:  because she can guide me through register procedures.. because she knows them so well that she's learned them herself.  because she isn't upset, when we need guidance.  because she knows she's there a lot, and makes fun of herself for it.  because she looks like she'll be one of the crabby ones, but she isn't.  because she's unexpected.  Altace:  because i screwed up, and she knew i screwed up, and she knew as well that i fucked her over, and made her wait a few extra minutes.. when it shouldn't have taken that long.  because she didn't let on that she knew.  because she let herself be taken by my small-talk while her prescription was being filled today.  because she knew it would pass the time.  because she let me help the time pass.   Cora:  because even though she yells at the rest of us, she calls Mary her "angel".  because Mary deserves it.  because the rest of us fuck up occasionally (usually at least once with her drugs), but she realizes Mary doesn't have anything to do with it.  because i love Mary, and anyone who makes Mary feel good is OK in my book.  even if she's continuously pissed off at me.  most importantly, i love the people who i can make smile.  i love the people who can't help but smile back at me, when i'm in the middle of something, and can't stop to help them, so i smile at them.  i love them for the unconscious smile they give me, in return.  i love that i can make people happy by smiling at them, and most of all, i love that sometimes, even the grumpiest of them all have to smile back, because it's a reflex for them.  it helps me to realize that they're human.  i almost love the ones who don't  mean  to smile back a little more.. because when i catch them catching themselves, and smile  more , they almost always smile  more  in return.  that's wonderful, and it gives me a reason to go back on monday.

      if the drug dealers' friends beep the horn  one more time  to get their attention, i'm going to go all crazy-neighbor and beat them to death.   i hate that .   i lived in Rochester, MN, for a summer, and the apartment we lived in was a little odd - everyone sharing space with us happened to be foreign (we  said  somalia, but that might have been an assumption.. you know.. it was easier than determining their  actual  decent, so we just went with it.  mainly because giving them a label was easier).  it made for some strange cultural shocks.  for one, i don't particularly find the smell of somolian food appetizing.  just a personal preference, one that was beat into my head all summer long.  i guess the smell of their food carries farther?  maybe it was just that it didn't really smell like "food" to me, and it was constantly around.  another thing that irked me was the beeping; the constant nature of which led me to believe that either the cars in somolia didn't have horns, or they didn't have that muscle in the back of their necks (the one that twitches in spasms when it hears the beeps continued).   the smell might be a random association - the whole summer was one of my worsts.  it was three years ago (in some ways, i think  "three years?  it feels like yesterday!" , and in others, i think,  "wow, only three years?  so much has changed.." ), and the summer wasn't one of those that will go down in my memory as being one of the best.. not by a long shot.  i didn't see my family all summer long, and we were pretty well disconnected from our friends, as well.  Sam was working a lot, and when he wasn't working, he was stressed out.  at that point in his life, when Sam got stressed out, he took it out on a 1.75 of  really cheap  vodka.  and we argued, a lot - mostly when he was sober, but the silence carried over into his drunk.  everyone was sick - just the facts of life in a town where the major pull is the medical center, i guess.  but i'd never really seen so many deathly ill people in one place, and it was depressing.  i worked (for half the summer) in a party goods store, and we sold balloons.  the balloons were more often "get well" bouquets than anything else.  it was unnerving.  the smell was constant, the whole summer long.  it was hell, and that was the aromatherapy, the atmosphere smelled of somolian cooking.  the beeping, however, is more of a major annoyance to me.  it sets off that button in my head that makes me want to scream.  it tells me that someone is too lazy to walk to a door, and ring a doorbell.  the beepers (the lazy people) are usually impatient as well.  the frequency of the beeps leads me to believe they expect their expected party to  materialize , and the absurdity of that idea hurts my head.  the other part of it that annoys me is the sheer stupidity of it all - if everyone who visits anyone in an apartment building is  beeping  to get the attention of the visitee's, then how the hell will anyone know they're supposed to go to check?  for that whole summer, it was as if we were the only ones in the place who didn't have beeping visitors.. pretty much the only thing we knew if someone was beeping, was that  it wasn't for us .  i  hate  beeping.

      seems that sometimes, a favorite place can be made so much better by the company you have when you're there.  the place is amazing, and wonderful, and it still holds some of my best memories ever.. and now one more.  being able to lead you into that water (that's much, much too cold for someone from missouri), was great.. seeing your face, and knowing that you were freezing, but that you trusted me that it would get better - enough to follow me in there, regardless, that was wonderful.  holding your hand, and leading you through the waves, and watching you watch those people on the water, "Like in a wooden chair, or like in a lounge chair..?" was so incredibly beautiful.  hearing you say (even if it was a lie, lol) that the water felt good after a while, was something i'd been hoping for.   taking you around, showing you all the sights (sites), and telling you those stories was one of the most important things i've ever done.  i think that's why the headache came, because i knew how much it meant to me, and it was so overwhelming that you understood, as well.   the ride home was pretty cool, too.  ;)

      ok, i'm going to try to explain something.  when a new drug comes out onto the market, the manufacturers of said drug have a certain right to it.. they get to be the only makers of that particular blend of chemicals for a certain amount of time.   that's why we have  brand  name drugs.  i believe that right now, it's set at 7 years.  when that expires, then other manufacturers can start marketing the same drug, and they can manufacture it under the  generic  name.  which is the  chemical compound  name for that drug.  it's the  same damn thing , but it costs less, because it's not the  brand .  when drugs first come onto the market, some insurance companies don't trust them for a while, or they give customers extra hell for being put on that medication.  this is a  bitch  to deal with.  people end up paying more for a drug that they need (sometimes, one they need to  survive ), just because it's new.  and we, as pharmacy technicians, have to go through hell, because none of the customers really  realize  the steps we have to take to make sure it's being done correctly, and that they're not  paying too much .   the RPh we had working in our store before i came to join the "team" (before i came and we made an  entirely new  team, that is) had everyone re-organize the shelves of prescription medication.   the normal way (that most pharmacies use) is to alphabetize the drugs by the  brand  names.  in that system, the  brand  name drugs get added in when they come out, and the  generic  equivilents are filed next to them.  this makes sense, oddly enough.  but if someone is looking for a  generic  drug by name, it makes it a little more difficult, as they have to know the  brand  name, in order to find the medication.  this isn't the way he had them organize things.  our pharmacy is organized in the opposite manner.  the  generic  drugs are filed alphabetically, with the  brand  names filed next to the generic.  this makes a  little  bit of sense, but it presents the same problem as the above system, and none of the temp RPh's we have coming in can seem to understand it.  not to mention those of us who are trying to find the meds, and re-file them after we're done with them.  it ends up being a big ol'mess.  there's even more of a glitch.  are you ready?  we have 8 different sections of medications.  section 1:  OTC.  over the counter medications that we keep back there, either because it's possible to abuse them, or because there are special directions, or because they just are more convenient to keep back there.  they include diabetes testing supplies, some vitamin supplements, some suppositories, and some cold medicine.  section 2:  ointments and creams.  for god knows why.  section 3:  eyedrops and some (but not all!) of our eardrops and nose sprays.   section 4:  suppositories (the ones that are prescription).   section 5:  birthcontrol, and for some reason, some of our menapausal medications.  section 6:  pills.  and some of our nasal sprays, and some injections.  section 7:  inhalers and asthma medication (nebulizer stuff).  section 8:  antibiotics (the re-constitution-requiring ones).  you can see how it's a little difficult to get the hang of where to find things in there, and why it's such a relief that we're going to re-organize (why i was there today!), starting out by at least going through section 6, and organizing by Alphabet.  none of this "by  brand " or "by  generic " bullshit.   wow, long and boring.  i hope someone learned something.

      at work today, threw a temper-tantrum at us, making us all look terribly incompetant.  i hate that.   we're not .  when there are 6 people at the counter, all blustering and impatient and upset, and all having problems, it's the one with the sick 8 year old who just got released from the hospital and needs his medication that will take precidance.  sorry, lady, them's the breaks.   i felt like the guy in Clerks today.. trying to do what i was there to do, on my day off, and getting called aside constantly to fix the problems and run buffer between the frustrated people and the angry people (you can guess which ones were which.. they both apply to both).   "and i wasn't even supposed to BE here today!"   tomorrow, i fear, will be more of the same, except i'm going to be the person actually  supposed  to be there, and so i can't run off and escape to my own little world when i need to.   my emotions are all crazy today, i'm hoping that there's a reason behind it, for many reasons.  i know that part of it is just a need that i have, that i got to experience a few days ago.. for a little while.  i'm sad, today, that things can't be how they should.  it might get worse before it gets better.  all i know is.. i can't wait for that.

      there's a little girl inside of me, and i try to protect her all the time.  it gets tiring.  i coax her to do her best, even though i know she'll get the smallest amount of thanks, and that most of it will have to come from me.  i don't mind encouraging her, it's what i do.  i'm reassuring by nature.  but at the same time, she's a little harder to reassure than most.  she knows all my tricks.  she's a lot like that one girl from that vampire movie, actually.  she's older and wiser than she looks.  i tell her things to make her do her best, but more importantly (most, i'd argue), i try not to let her get too excited.  i try not to let her get worked up - over the good  or  over the bad.  i don't like her to overreact, it's not becoming, and i know that.  she can't just throw a temper-tantrum whenever things don't go her exact way, calling every phone number she can get until such time as someone answers, for godssake, and then leave insano messages (bad-insano, not fun-insano) everywhere, whining for a re-call.  that's why i don't let her get too excited in the good way, too.  some people find a soft spot in her armor.  they see what's there, and what's not there, and they understand, and they really do appreciate her for all her parts.  then she lets herself go, even though she knows it's dangerous.  that sometimes, not always, but sometimes, leads to her getting disappointed.  she doesn't like getting let down.  not because she gets angry, or because she doesn't understand.. quite the opposite.  she never really gets disappointed in other people - or very rarely - but she does, all to often, disappoint herself.  she understands  too well .  she can come up with so very many reasons why things don't happen the way she wants them to, and most of them are horrible (at least.. to her they are), but that doesn't mean she doesn't see how it could happen.  she even knows enough to hate this about herself.  it's her insecurity.  in fact, she'll want me to take this down, because it's something vulnerable, and she thinks it's giving away too much.  but i don't think i will.  she resents me for times like right now.

      i've got the feeling that my toronto trip is disintegrating between my toes.  thing is, it doesn't really matter  too  much.. just enough to sting.  it might be paranoia, but i've got a feeling that it's not the most welcome thing ever for me to be there.  i mean, i realize that it was never exactly set in stone, but it's a little odd to be getting calls trying to convince me not to go (however subtle they might think they're being).  probably total paranoia.   probably you shouldn't set any plans in concrete - it's setting quickly, without me in it.

      i punched in 3 minutes late, just enough time for everyone to start flipping out, and causing bad chain-reactions.  megan called jeanne, jeanne (despite my NUMEROUS attempts to inform her that she should  call my cellphone  if she needs me) called my home.  at lunch, mom flipped out, thinking i wasn't home, left a nasty message on my cell phone - to the tune of, "you'd better get your ass (AND MY CAR) into town and into work, if you're not already *growl, hiss, snarl*.   because i was late, i didn't have time to fuck around with putting my cell phone in my locker, because i don't remember the combination (again.. i know, i'm a putz), and security saw, and she flipped out.  thought she was done ranting, so i went to pharmacy - only to have her come back there a few minutes later and tell me that i should, "consider this my last warning about this stuff, and  don't ever walk away from her like that again .   hank gave me glarey eyes for being late, made up a piss-poor story about my car not starting (i  was  after all, driving mom's van).  everyone seemed ok with it.  becky was late, too, so i didn't shoulder all the blame.. instead, i probably made her feel like it's no big deal to be late - but it  is .  have to make that clear today.  at lunch, i apologised to security again, tried to explain why what happened did, and she was fine.. we talked it through, and she's not all pissed at me anymore.. but then..  after lunch, store manager wanted to sit down and have a chat.  seemed hank was ranting on friday that i ask too many questions.. vollunteered to talk to hank, and let him know i'm  learning , and that's why i'm asking questions.. so i can teach the girls.  cory was relieved, but then gave me a small talking-to about security.  informed him of the measures already taken to remedy that.. he said he appreciated it, and all was well.. then brought up both points again.  sheesh, i'm not that hard to work with, people.  talked to hank, told him what was going on, flattered him.. and he said something about not talking so much, working more.  but i could tell he was pleased, he actually  laughed  and made a few (bad) jokes, later on in the day.   so everything is smoothed over, all the shouldn't-be-so-jagged edges are sanded down, and the best part is.. i didn't really care about it anyways.  all i had to do was remember being right next to you, and it all melted away.

      i'm remembering a lot of things, and reading again, and wanting to know more about a lot of things...  Pedro reminds me of the Juan story, and that makes me laugh, a lot.  i want to see the animals all over, and the rocks that move.   i'm excited, and want to talk about the rocket launcher and the flailing, but i dont think i should.  there's so much, and i know there'll be so much more, and that make me excited, and nervous, and anxious for it all to start, and impatient, and slightly worried, all at the same time.  i'm waiting for a call, and it's coming slower than i wanted, but i know there's good reasons.  i want to tell about a lot of things, but i know that first, i want to hear what B has to say, so i'm trying to contain myself.. plus, it's hard to put into words, and it's wonderful, and i'm sure he's got a great take on things that i haven't thought of yet.  so i want to read his thoughts, before i type my own.  also, slightly nervous (although totally sure that i'm mistaken) that it'll not be what i thought it was, what i know it was, and don't want to jynx it before it's said by him.  want to see certain people's blogs.. i want to read more of what people who reply to my posts have to say, because i love knowing things.  i wish i had more to read, and more to go on.  still can't wait to see cam's reaction to the rocket launcher, it was priceless.  it's nice (oh, god.. so nice) to let someone else have control of the worrying.. as i seem to worry too much, all the time, about stuff i shouldn't worry about - nice to know that someone i trust will be worrying if there's anything to worry about.. and he'll tell me if there is.  lisa wants reassurance that she didn't seem all slutty with her missions, so if you could give me ample reason to reassure her (or even slight reason to), i'll happily do so.  i think ( think ) this'll be the last post for tonight.  i can't wait to see what you've got to say about the whole thing.. you'll make my time away.

      here's what my month looks like.. i'll try to make it as realistic as possible:     August     1-3:  working a lot.. not much else.   4:  out with grady, good times.    5:  out collecting debt/playing dice.  crazy fun.   6-9:  Heaven.   10-12:  working a lot.. again.   13-14:  up north, corn roast on 14th.  good times.   15:  off work, hella hangover.   16-20:  work a lot.  woo-hoo.   21:  Tim and Kristen's wedding.  :)  see a bunch of old friends, have great time, etc.   22:  hangover.  great.   23-26:  work a lot, and pack for toronto.  probably do all the pack thing on the 26th, or 27th waaaay to early.   27-30:  toronto, hope it'll be fun, hope i don't get murdered, etc.      and then for  :     Labor Day     Hang out with Misty and family and friends, go rafting.  should be amazing fun.        anything after this is sort of up for grabs.  reserve your time now :).

      missing a flight could be so great?  that the third day, after the second (greatest day ever) could be so wonderful, too?  that maybe the fourth would be even more splendid?  i'm going to hold you to those things you said, you know.  best be researching all the time - and letting me know what you find out!  i'm so excited, and hopeful, and happy.  just thinking about what's to come is making me.. smile.

      to wish me a happy belated birthday.  she didn't call on the day, because she heard that i had a date, and she didn't want to interrupt.  i told her that it was with that guy i just happened to run into, and no, that he wasn't from around here.  they're going floating on labor day weekend sometime, it won't be as good as it could be, if i'm alone.  it's all so ironic.  mom asked if i was still going to toronto, and asked if someone else was going too.  i don't know, i think i invited him, i have a vague memory.  8-27 is when i get there, 8-30 is when i leave.  she said she didn't know why she felt better with him there, cause she doesn't know him either, she just would.

      it's ok, it's good, it's great, it's amazing, because it was  meant  to happen this way.  it might hurt a little, or a lot, or be unbearable, but it's ok.  it's temporary.   i've got this little dream in my head, that i'll keep for a while, probably longer than i want to keep it there, of that house.. the one i was talking about.  Neenah is great.  Loads of good memories there - the ones from the past.   i'm so glad i'm able to give (and give and give) and have myself be appreciated.  i'm more glad that now, unlike before, i'm able to take, because taking makes things sweeter sometimes.  not as sweet as that stuff, but sweet enough to be right.  i can't even really say the right things, right now.  i'm at ease.  i'll tell lisa about that bad thing that happened, and see what she's got to say about this continuing, but i'm pretty sure we know where we stand until then.   to the friend:  i ate captain morgan wings last night, and in case everyone else forgets to tell you, i did it in honor of you.  everyone else found it fitting.   blue moon is ok, if you're in the mood.  miller lite is good, but it's not as good as it is when it makes you drunk.  maybe it's better.  point white biere is good, i like it.  much better than leinies original, but dad'll appreciate that i didn't appreciate it.   swimming is amazing, i forgot how much i like it.  i forget all the time.  need to do it more often, enjoy the feeling of being surrounded, and warm, and free, and that vague sensation that i might drown.   glad for the mutual "S/he's funny" comment, it makes a difference.  glad for the last thing that happened, and we probably have a few pictures to show for your efforts.  everything happened when i was 16, except for when it happened again when i was 24.   if i'd have known what i know now, we could have skipped all the bullshit.  glad you don't warn everyone, though, you deserve for them not to know.   you're 1/2 hour away right now, and all i can think about is driving down there and doing that  really funny thing .

        Leinies Honey Weiss, or something special that i heard is good.  hair removal products  garbage bags (for car,  gross  car)  cigarettes  ATM (not get AN ATM, get CASH from ATM) (maybe kill twice with one, and do by debit)  suitably awesome outfit (tank top, black capris, new shoes)  magic pixie dust to make me as perfect (instantly) as he thinks i am :)    (as written at aproximately 6:30 pm, on friday, august 6, 2004)

      Sitting spread-eagle on the (wobbly) toilet-seat-lid isn't my idea of a good time.  Holding that position for the "as few as 3!!!" minutes it claims to take is complete torture.  Holding it for the "no more than 10!!!" is even worse.  there are times when i just want to build myself a time machine and go back to the days before the height of fashion was looking like a 12 year old girl.. in all stages of dress.  it's embarassing the lengths we believe that we're "supposed" to go to, the idea of ourselves that we're led to believe is the norm.  i never  ever  want to see that shock on a guy's face again, when he learns out that somethings.. he's been misled about.  it's that look that makes you almost want to take hold of that little boy inside him's hand, look him in the eyes, and talk in that soothing voice (you know the one, girls!),  "i know this isn't what the guidebook  you  learned with told you, but  some  girls grow hair in more than one spot on their body...     it's a shame that they've almost got to love you unconditionally for that to be an ok thing, for it to be admissable.  still, a little part of me wants to give them that, at least the first few times.. that  illusion  of perfection they've been believing in since they first knew what it meant to wake up in a puddle for  that other reason .  still, i've been honest so far, and it's all been good.  perhaps i should do that sit-down talk, tonight.  it'll be interesting to see his reaction(s).  Guys!  Post what you think about this!  I have a feeling you'll say stuff that will make all us girls feel.. if not  good  exactly.. at least  more at ease .

"It's amazing when you meet someone, and you've got no chance of ever scaring them away, because they already know you."

      was wonderful, when what woke me up woke us both up, and tomorrow,  tomorrow .. tomorrow (i can't stop saying it), life will show us exactly why.  tomorrow is the most beautiful word in the world today, and that's why i'll say it a lot.  every time i do, i'll get a little smile, that smile is a secret smile, meant for me and you, and tomorrow ( tomorrow ) you'll get to see it.  only.. tomorrow, i have a feeling that my favorite word will be today.

       Here's a list of things that might possibly happen, for the weekend.  Feel free to Yay or Nay, please, I want things to go well, and for everyone to have as much fun as possible.  Also feel free to Yay or Nay the whole idea of an itinerary, some people would get pissed at too much planning.  I have a feeling I'm overthinking this whole thing, but it's part of what I do.  By thinking too much about it, it makes me feel calmer.  I have a feeling you know that already, but I also know that you know that I have to apologise anyways.  Anyway, (deep breath), here's what i've got so far for Friday (maybe it'd be easier for you to just comment where you live, lol.. i seem to want your thoughts on every single point):     Not stress too much at work.  Make my favorite food ever.  Busy self with making food and getting ready/looking fabulous, so as to not think too much about the time, or how long it's going to be/countdown.  Remember that countdown doesn't help anything, but makes me nervous and anxious.  Also remember that anxious = bad.  Have someone try the casserole, and have ready a recipe, for if it's considered as good as I think it is, for someone to give to Sr.    Go up north, visit mom briefly (as it's my birthday, and she feels bad if she doesn't see me on my birthday).  Also, might be the only way to see her this weekend, she'll probably stay up there the whole time.    Make our way up to the  perfect place .  Swim (bring suit!), look at the lake, share it with people (maybe bring lisa?.. maybe not - let me know your thoughts).  Make our way back, stop at Schoolhouse (that's the hoodie i prize ;). i love that place).  Sometime between now and then, research the statute of limitations on drinking and driving, on the off chance someone gets in trouble.    Go out for birthday in town, here.  See the different places i haunt, hopefully meet some people I know.  Would rather just run into them, than invite them out.  This isn't about stress, or forced-compatibility, this is about flow.  We're going with it.  (again, your thoughts?)  Hotel.   Saturday:   (Haven't decided what to do until ~5pm, any suggestions?  Oooh, maybe go to appleton to Buffalo Wild Wings for lunch.)  My best friend Grady's band is playing.  He told me that he doesn't expect anyone to be there, because it costs too much for anyone to actually show up.  When prodded, "too much"=$10 dollars to get in, and $5 to park.  It's sad that he thinks that none of his friends would be willing to pay less than $15 dollars to see his band play, so I sort of really want to go.  Can we squeeze this in around dinner?  Please let me know.  I haven't seen Grady's band ( urlLink http://www.scorerocks.com/062003/mrslateindepth6-03.html ) in a few years, so it would please me greatly (added bonus is probably understood without mention).  Dinner (though not baked fish thing, for previously explained reasons).  Races, around 10, because you seemed to think they'd be so amusing :).  Go out again?  We'll have to decide on this later.   I've got nothing but:   Stay in bed as long as possible.   for Sunday.  Open to suggestions, though.

      i learned this word today, and i thought i'd share:  nep·o·tism    urlLink   ( P )   Pronunciation Key   (np-tzm)n. Favoritism shown or patronage granted to relatives, as in business.  \Nep"o*tism\ (?; 277), n. [L. nepus, nepotus, nephew: cf. F. n['e]potisme. See  Nephew .] Undue attachment to relations; favoritism shown to members of one's family; bestowal of patronage in consideration of relationship, rather than of merit or of legal claim.  From nepotism Alexander V. was safe; for he was without kindred or relatives. But there was another perhaps more fatal nepotism, which turned the tide of popularity against him -- the nepotism of his order. --Milman.  i want the nepotism of my order, of my pharmacy, to be good, and i want it to turn people to us.  i want us to be suggested to other people.  i think we're going to be, because of me and because of my girls, because we're good people, and we'll be loved.  that makes me very very happy.

      Becky:  I know this prescription, we filled it before, and i credited it back, and put it back on the shelf.. I remember this one, we can fill this one, it's one of those.. si.. sil.. you know.. one of those.. *whispers* HARD-ON DRUGS.  Me:  (laughs so loudly that it's silent)(recovers, enough to say..)  You know why we had to credit that back, right?  You know why it was in the 10-day pull?  Why he didn't pick it up sooner?  Why we have to do the same thing, for hard-on-drugs all the time?  It's the same reason why we do it for migraine medication all the time...  Because they're not getting any .  So they don't have to pick up the prescription.

      i've got a peaceful, easy feeling.  i know the world is working right, and everything is falling into place.  sometimes, you've got to know how badly things can go, before you can fully appreciate how good they can go.  i know you won't let me down.  no doubts in my mind that anyone around me will not do their absolute  best , and that's all i expect.  all i want is for them to be themselves, i'm never  ever  disappointed by people being real.  everything is going to be wonderful, i just know it.  i'm already standing on the ground.  my feet are planted, firmly, in my reality, and that's all that matters.  i'm realistic enough to see things the way that i see things, in my own optimistic way, and that's wonderful, and all i need.  i'm observant, i trust my feelings, and my feelings are right.  i know where i am, i know who i am, and i know what i want.  everything is perfect.. and everything will be more perfect, shortly.

      today, i made up a new quote, and i love it.  it's my new theory on life:   "sometimes, life just makes the lemonade for you."   i know it's not a real sentance, but it's beautiful, and i love it.  life is making my lemonade for me today, there's no need for extra sweeteners - my lemons are being pre-sweetened, by the people around me, and the way i treat people.  karma is on my side.  the puzzle is snapping, and it's giving me that feeling, only with less of that one side of it.  still a  great  feeling, and i love it.

      that's how much i'm a RPh.  i get to sign things, as though i am, because i'm the most stable person in the pharmacy, and i love that.  i know the most about what's going on in our store, and i love it.  people come to me with their questions, and i don't always know the right answers, but i realized today that just because i don't know the answers doesn't make it impossible, or unattainable to find them.   we may not have all the answers to every question, but we have the means to  find  the answers to all the questions, given enough time .  telling the customers this makes them happy, and that makes me happy.  it makes me happy.  very happy.  the first part of this makes me feel special, the second part of this makes me relieved, and relaxed, and i need to remember it, always.  and to smile.   people like me today, the customers were good with me, and they were patient, and almost everyone who had a problem with us to begin with  apologised to me  for  my distress  at the end of our contact.  beautiful, and it makes me feel good.  of course, i told them that it was nonsense for them to be apologising to me, which made them feel even better.  one customer who had a problem two days ago (that really really bad day), and had me in tears, called me to check and see if the prescription had been filled yet, and i told her yes, that it had been taken care of that evening.. she apologised to me too.  her exact words:  " i'm sorry i was such a bitch" .  mmm, i love that.  i told her that it was nonsense, too, and i know she feels good about the pharmacy, now.  if not the entire pharmacy, at least she feels good about me, and that makes me happy.  because today, i know that i might just be enough to get people to stay with us, and not transfer.  that's a wonderful feeling.  my tummy gets all warm, to think that.  i love today.  everything today makes me feel special.

      someone needs to take my phone away from me, when i'm home alone.  last night might have deserved it, but it was still uncalled for.  and overcalled.  i should definately call sam again today - or maybe not.  all i can think are good thoughts, maybe i should leave it at that.  also, there's something downloading on my computer, so maybe i called for computer assistance?   sorry cam, for making you be support-guy over the phone last night.  only ex-boyfriends should have that sort of crap.  you two gave  great  help, though.. hopefully tonight i won't be too far gone to remember to defrag before bed.  again, very sweet of (both of) you.  sam popped the question to the girl.  last week.  told me about him, his girl (fiance!), his family.  think i let too much spill about my opinions on them and such, but hopefully, i don't have to apologise for that shit anymore.  hopefully, we've both grown enough.  talked with him for a long time, it seemed like.. or maybe it just seemed like a long time, because i realized a lot.  i'm not upset about him being engaged.  at first, when he met this lady, i was.  slightly jealous, i guess.  i kept asking myself, "If i'm the one who let him go, shouldn't  I  be having the good karma, and finding the love of my life first?"  it made me jealous - not i-wanna-be-with-him jealous, more i-wanna-meet-my-best-person jealous.   maybe the reason that i'm not, anymore, is because i  have ?  i'd love to think so, but my head won't let my heart think that far ahead.  if i think too far ahead, i might get whiplash in two days, if the world crashes down.  only two full days in between, now.  i'm practically  purring .

      Dr. Shaw was amazing.. IS amazing.  he's that old-school, home-remedies-that-actually-work, no-nonsence, take-no-prisoners-make-no-enemies sort of guy, and it totally carried through to his veterinary medicine.   his clients were the most loyal (of the 3 vets at my clinic), and even the one's he couldn't stand loved him beyond the normal vet-client relationship.  i got the feeling that several of them would die for him, that they were actually  waiting  for the opportunity to do so.  that enthusiasm is hard to ignore.    Sparkles is a cat.  Sparkles (at the time) was aproximately 17 years old, in severe kidney failure.  Karen is Spark's mom.  Karen would have drunk Sparkle's urine, if Dr. Shaw told her it would help his condition.  Karen wanted to take Spark to get a kidney transplant.  Karen only backed out because it wasn't viable.  i have vowed to own a cat named after either Karen or Sparkles, someday.  probably Karen, she was the one who impressed me most, out of the pair.   my point is, even though Dr. Shaw wasn't the biggest fan de Sparks, he  never  showed Karen anything of the sort.  sometimes, it was veiled thinly, but his discontent at Karen (and Sparkles) was always concealed.  he was amazing at  appearing  as though his life depended on their happiness.  i look up to that.  not for the deceit, but for the reaction he got from Karen (Sparks could have cared less, lmao).  she was devoted to him, utterly.. and all it took from him was the tiniest of efforts.  it showed me, and taught me, a lot on how to interact with customers and clients.  i put some of what he taught me into use, every single day.  i'm not sure he understands what he showed me, or that he would appreciate me voicing that appreciation.. but it's there.   today, i sat on a bench for 15 minutes (that i couldn't spare, i spared them..) and talked with a woman about her prescription, and explained for 5 minutes longer than i should have had to, why we couldn't fill it.  i spent an extra 3 minutes, asking her how she was doing, and encouraging her.  she's on radiation therapy, and needs to drive 45 miles per day, for 30 days.  i made her smile, and helped her look on the bright side of things.  it's more than worth it, to me, to see her smile, and to see her burden lift a little, when she says, "Well, you're right.. 20 days sounds much better than 30.."  that sort of thing makes me smile, and for as long as i can, i'll keep sitting on the bench with people like her.. people who don't really realize that anyone cares anymore.

      i'm passing this along, because i feel like everyone needs to know this, and to use it in their everyday work experience.  it was shared with me over lunch last week, and (as it seems like everyone is having shitty times at work lately) i feel like i'm not the only one who might benefit from the advice.  there are a few things that you (the lowly employee) can do to lighten up your work, and make your experiences there more relaxed, and therefore less stressful.  - use a calm tone of voice.  no matter how frustrated you become, talk in a soothing, low, quiet tone.  it helps in the same way that it's been proven that smiling makes you feel happier, i've found.  and when you seem more calm, the people you're around will feel ridiculous being high-strung about everything, and they will calm themselves, and everything will move more smoothly.  you know how, when everything seems incredibly  dire , it seems to go as rough as it possibly can, and when things feel relaxed, everyone seems to move more in sync?  it's a reverse psychology thing.. it really does work, i've seen it.  (this is a little dependant upon you -the pretender- being a good actor)  - apologise.  profusely.  to co-workers, to customers/clients, to bosses.  not only that, but  sympathize, and mean it .  there are so many times when i've been apologised to, when i could tell outright that the person doing giving said apology didn't mean a word of it.. and it made things SO much worse.  but, again, if i could tell that the person really truly felt my distress, i was much less angry, and felt as though they were really trying.  try to see things from their perspective.  understand that from their standpoint, there are different priorities, and don't try to force them to see your point of view.. just let them know that you're working as hard as  you possibly can, and that, given the circumstances, things are actually going rather smoothly - let them know that all that's required is the tiniest bit of patience, and everything will be  fine .  - do everything in your power to please them.  there have been several occasions in the past week-or-so that i've had to offer things to people that didn't seem attainable, or realistic.  i've offered to mail people their prescriptions, when it would be more viable to just have them pick them up (not to mention, more cost-efficient).  the funny thing is, though.. if you offer these things out of sympathy for their troubles, they're less likely to take you up on them.  only one of the six people i've offered this in the past week has actually had us mail them the goods.  the other five realized that i was doing everything in my power to help, and going way out of my way, and chosen to make that extra trip in to pick up the things they were (are) owed.  - when things get too hectic, remind the people in closest contact with you that everything will work out.  keep reassuring the people around you that everything will be fine, let them know that everyone is doing things to the best of their ability, and keep the flow going.  be grateful to them, when things work out.. over-compliment them.. and  mean  it.  because, no matter how you could have seen things through better, they did the best they could.   know that.   no one wants things to be difficult.  - get personal.  ask people how they are doing, compliment them on how they're holding up, let them know how vital they are.  because, as silly as it sounds, when things get crazy, people feel useless.  the more they're trying to do, the less efficently they tend to do things.  let them know that their extra work means something to you, and to the customers/clients.  even if the clients don't notice.  this applies to the customers/clients themselves, as well.  this is collective advice from many many people i've worked with, also plain observations i've made.  i hope you guys take it with a grain of salt, but also (more importantly) that it makes a difference.

      i want everyone to know how great i am, out of pure selfishness...  i just went through the trouble of adding someone who isn't myself to blogger.com, and loving the fact that i did it right.. and also that he let me do it.   marc, i've been talking to you for almost.. fuck, is it a year and a half?  you're great, and you've got my stamp of approval.  i really hope you do well, and i (absolutely) hope that you keep posting, because i love hearing about what's going on with you, and how you're doing.  sometimes, you worry me, boy.   i'm glad (so glad) to hear that what i did was acceptable, and glad (so glad) to see that i am (was) right.. all you need sometimes is someone else's enthusiasm to get you going.  i hope the people who read  my  blog read yours, and see why i haven't stopped talking to you (yet).

      they've got a pretty friendly relationship.  both of them realize that they're not "supposed" to be great friends, i think, but if you happen to catch them when they think no one's watching, sometimes you catch them in a cuddle.  they dont  always  fight over the sunbeam.  they share.  but certain things make me think that the relationship might not be all sunshine and lollipops.. for example:  sometimes, when i'm petting the cat, and he's up in my lap or on my chest when i'm sleepy, i'll look up and notice that he's staring at the dog, and that the dog is doing his best to not do his mournful expression.  the cat  gloats  at augie.  poor baby, he can't fit on anybody's lap, or on anyone's chest.  at least not without suffocating someone.  the cat has a habit of walking around, following whoever happens to be moving the most in the house, calling out.. "Mrroooow."  the script usually follows as such, Me:  "where the heck are my shoes?" Kitty:  "Mrooowwww!" Me:  "what?" Kitty:  "Mrooowww." Me:  "You're not helping.." Kitty:  "Mrooowwwww!" Me:  "Oh, will you shu-" Kitty:  "MRROOOWWW!" and this morning was no exception.  i have, however, noticed a phenomenon recently that i think has been happening for a long time, and only recently  come to my attention.  as i was getting increasingly impatient with the cat, there was an increasingly louder "thump, thump, thump", coming from the back hallway (a floor above me), where augie was laying.  the more frustrated i got at the cat, the more loud the thumping.  he doesn't want to admit it, but i think the dog gets terribly pleased when someone puts the cat in his place.

      i took a nap, a short one, but it was a nap nonetheless, and talked some things through with a wonderful person, and read something a wonderful person had to write about crappy days, and it made me think a little more clearly about the whole mess.  there are many bad things that are happening at work (the biggest of which is, i'm training people, when i don't feel completely competant yet, myself), but this too, shall pass (have i mentioned i think i might be losing some of my hair, due to stress?).  in the meantime, there are many many things for which to be grateful:   the two girls whom i am training are bright, and funny, and are interested in making things run as smoothly as possible, given the circumstances.  they are motivated when it comes to making things run smoothly in the future; they want to help me do what i can to make that possible.  they respect me, and like me.  the shroud of authority i'm weaving around myself is decieving them, for that i'm eternally grateful.  the girl whom i am  not  officially training, who started around the same time as i did, is also accepting my leadership, and looking to me with her issues.  she is frustrated, but calm, and i'm thankful that i've got her to be an example to me, even as she's learning from me.  the girls who've been there longer than me (other than the BigD) are also respecting my decisions, and telling me i'm doing fantastic, in spite of the obstacles.  also, the BigD is going on a month-long hiatus, leaving me to hone these girls to the height of their efficency (muah-hahah) without having her there to sabotage my efforts.  i have someone who'll pick me up, when i'm having one of the shittiest days ever.  i've got Karen, whom i can call when i'm at work, i've got my girls, who are wonderful and understanding, even when i'm on the edge of breakdown, i've got Karen's boss, who has a soft spot for me since i talked to him today - also probably because he's heard Karen speak highly of me, and i've got my little brother who can sense that something's not quite right even by the tone of my voice when i'm trying to hide it, and his great advice to help me through.  and i've got him, the idea of him, the voice of him, the soothing of him, to listen to me and to tell me i'm wonderful, and send me off to sleep.  i've got the prospect of him to wake up to, evermore.  that's a splendid idea.   Robby told me to start tai chi, mentioned something ridiculous like, "Breathe in the harvest, let go of the corn"?  sounds like drivel to me, but his, "Just leave it at work, sweetie," meant a lot.  hard to do, but it meant a lot.

      today sucked.  today sucked  royally .  it's the first of the month, by pharmacy hours, and that's bad enough.  but it's also 2 of the girls i'm trainings' 4th and 2nd days.  so everyone was coming to me with their problems, as i was in the middle of the bigger (though not necessarily more important problems) and everyone was hella confused.  to make matters worse, the customers were  particularly  impatient.. and in some cases, downright beligerant - even after being explained to a dozen times that we are all in training.. even with us all being all smiles and apologies.  i worry about the girls, wonder if they'll take this.  the RPh wasn't much help, even when they were yelling at us.  in a perfect world, i'd like to be backed up by my boss, when people are screaming at me.

      there are few memories that are fond, and yet as disjointed, as our collective memory of this particular party.  everyone who was there remembers it fondly, as a party for the ages.. few are very clear on how it happened, and fewer on the timeline of the memorable events of the night.  a few of the points that we've come to agree upon (of course open to debate as to the actual timeline):  - i, showing up at lisa's mom's house, to give her her birthday present (which she still uses, a bathroom caddy).  when i mentioned this (keep in mind, we were both sober at this point in the day), she said, "Oh, it was my birthday?  no  wonder  i remember fireworks!"  her birthday is typically celebrated on the day of the shawano fireworks.  - lisa taking her dad into town to buy alcohol for the party.. him thinking we would be well-stocked with what he'd picked out, her feeling too ashamed to point out that we would probably need three times that amount, given the group she'd invited.  - starting drinking much too early.  (lisa's memory is as follows) lisa, i, mindy, and sako standing around a bottle of MD20/20 (orange jubilee), discussing (of all things!) masturbation.  sako getting disgusted, she'd never even  think  of such a thing.. mindy, taking enormous swig of jubilee, swallowing, and glaring at sako, "Well maybe you   should  ."  lisa and i snickering knowingly.  - mindy and lisa running off to gather other people for the party.  driving around town for what seemed like  ages , leaving me and her dad to tend to the guests at lisa's party.  in between taking them outside for circular group discussions involving the phrase, "Dude, you're fucking up the rotation!"  - lisa remembers going to the fireworks, so i feel like i should include that, even though i have no recollection.  - everyone being frantic, at the realization we were running out of alcohol (in the daylight!), and not knowing how to fix it, as everyone was either: a)intoxicated, or b)underage.  - tim showing up in the nick of time, with 4 cases of expired tequiza in his trunk ("they were just going to throw it away!"), everyone deciding that it wasn't the  worst  thing they'd ever drank.. i guess, which turned into exclamations of, "wow, imagine how good it is when it's NOT stale!!!" as the night wore on.  - lisa and mindy dirty dancing to nirvana, in a naughty rendition of the dance they made up when they were 12.  - getting overly warm in my tube top, and mindy loaning me her bikini top to wear.  subsequently, when i said something about feeling over-exposed, lisa's  dad  saying, "Oh, i don't know, you look about perfect to me," leaving me slightly uncomfortable with him forevermore.  - sammy sitting on the front steps with the bottle of mudslide she'd single-handedly (after swiping it from us, and drinking it all for herself, grr!) drank, telling lisa's dad that she was  fine , and that she could drink three more, and still be  fine .  she was playing lisa's role, the "it's ok, i'm the only sober one here," role.   - wandering off to the lake, and standing with todd for a while, i believe he wanted to look at my boob, but refused to kiss me, which made me feel slightly good, and slightly like dirt, all at the same time.  lisa finding us, being  pissed  for a few seconds, then us all going out to eat.  as it was about 9 am.  god, i still can't believe that i was a part of that.  it seems so fun, like something i'd dream about doing.  at times, i'm so immature, this is all i ever want to do with my spare time.  and i don't care, it's still some of the best memories i have, and i don't want to quit making memories like this.  there's something (a lot of things!) to be said for memories that are this fond, and yet this disputable, all at once.  i don't get to spend this kind of time often enough with people who actually matter to me.  i should call sami (my sami, not lisa's sammy) and see when she's free next week.  i feel the need for a night out.
