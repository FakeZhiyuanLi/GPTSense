      Wow, it really has been ages since i've written in here! So so much to say... so much... looks like another long entry coming up for you all to feast your eyes upon. :P   Believe it or not, the first week of my holidays has already past! *blinks* Yeh... so I guess i'll start with last Friday, fantastic night that it was! *grins* It happened to be Tom Howard's 18th Birthday party... dear God it seems like such a long time ago now... anyway, it was a dress-up party "Dress up as your favorite musician" and I could hardly dress up as Eddie Vedder. :P So a bunch of us girls, Lu, Pheebs, Starkie, Em and myself decided to go as the Spice Girls, and I got stuck with skanky Ginger! Everyone said that I should've been Baby, and y'know I actually agree for once, but no... Pheebs decided that she would be Baby and I would be Ginger, so that was that. Anyway, we promised Tom that we'd be early, but ended up being two hours late or something, and I turned up looking totally disgusting, so thank God for the free beer and champagne to accompnay my Bacardi, or that night would've sucked!  Anyway, the party was pretty good as it happened, I manged to get myself drunk enough to have a great night, despite the rumours being spread later, but i'll get to that in a paragraph further on.  I also had a big talk to my ex-boy John and managed to de-weirdify things which is always a good thing. :)  The night after that was Mel's 18th Birthday dinner at La Suprema which was also nice, despite the weirdness that sort of came out between Pheebs and myself. It was really just her snubbing me a lot, and being a bitch to me, and I assumed it was because I had seen her the night before doing what looked like kissing John, only I had asked her about it and she had flat-out denied it, and so I believe her, but I just assume that she thought that I didn't or something... I don't know, it was weird, and she flirted with John all night and seeing as she's one of my best friends, I was shitted with her. *nods*  Over the last week i've really just worked a lot, God, I have so much to say and really I just can't be bothered saying it at all. Blah. I think I might sign out here, and at a later date, explain things that might need explaining. *nods*   Lotsa Love, Simbles xoxo

      *blobs around* Well, I swear, I just ate enough to feed an entire country for the next week. Or two. But that's not really the point of this post, Dear God did I have an eventful weekend!!!   I guess I should start with Friday, seeing as Thursday just sucked the cock and had no real purpose. :P So... Friday... Got up early and did Pre-Bond for Arrie and Dain and then figured out that I had the times wrong and was actually an hour late! *blushes* But yes, ended up being late to school, which was fine, soldiered on through the day and went shopping with the boys in the afternoon, and then convinced them all that we should all go and see After Juliet again, because I'd promised Starkey I'd go with her and Leva.  Anyway, the play was good again, although I think the first time I saw it was better...   And afterwards, we stuck around to talk to the cast, and who should come up to me but A? Yes, that's right, he told me to come back in a couple hours and pick him up after the cast and crew had finished packing up, so I did... 10.30 I picked him up, and we went to his place and hung out for a while, and the cruised over to the Drama Crew After Party, which sucked. A lot. As in, they were sitting there watching Mary and Frederic's Royal Wedding, so A and I shot through and ended up going to a party at Squalor Lodge after being charged a ridiculous amount of money for a bottle of Bacardi and some cans of rum & coke.    So yes, for those of you who happen to be uneducated, the Lodge is the house of the O'Farrell brothers, and their mother Margo.  My sister, who gets along famously with me, happens to be friends with the older o'Farrell brother who no longer lives at the Lodge, and yet still her generation continues to party there almost every weekend.  So yes, myself, A, Meumann, Ian and Gin all ended up there, surrounded by mostly my sisters friends and a bunch of people who we didn't know, and I proceeded to get myself very drunk.  'Twas great.  Anyway, I ended up having some great conversations with those of my sisters friends who I knew (Sam, Tristan, Jem, Margo, and Bec's paralytic boyfriend Jon) and somehow managed to get myself in the kitchen drinking shots with a guy who called himself Luke, and I later coined Luke Skywalker.  Luke Skywalker spent about an hour telling me how I shouldn't fuck with him because there were people after him man, he stole $500,000 of cocaine off a guy who held a knife to his throat, and he has millions stored away, millions, and he's a dangerous fucker, only now he's out of all that shit and works at the caz for $25 an hour.  My arse you did, Skywalker. Obviously Jedi's can lie. :P And several times throughout the night, Skywalker told me "but don't worry baby, it's all good sweetie" and tried to kiss me.  Horny fuck.  I don't care if you're remotely goodlooking when I'm pissed as a fart, keep your filthy lying paws off me. *nod*  Another thing that happened, A, being the touchy feely guy he is hugged me and kissed my cheek several times throughout the night, and Sam actually asked me if we were together. *blink* How strange... A and I are definitely not together, whatever doubts in my mind about his feelings or mine or whatever, we're not together and God knows I wouldn't want to be with him. *nods* He's just so... Him! But anyway, off track again...  So, after leaving the Lodge at around 4.30am in my very own drunken stupor, with a not-so drunken A, and not-particularly-drunk-at-all Meumann and Ian, after Gin having gone home because she was so scared of everyone already, I got myself through the front door only to have my mother scream at me about going up to my sister's place and letting herself and her boyfriend inside.  My immediate thought was; 'Oh fuck, he's left them at the Lodge somewhere' so I left my mates at my place and got a lift back up to the Lodge, where I saw a shirtless Wil o'Farrell with a strange scratch on his back, and grabbed his hand and asked him to help me search for them... But then I started to remember that Jon - the idiot - had wanted to drive  himself home, so I'd taken his keys and put them in his back pocket.  So up to Bec's place we go, and yes... That's right... They were still in his back pocket. :P Ridiculous, I know.  The ride home was interesting, to say the least.  My mother flew into a spontaneous fit of rage at me, and by the time we got inside, I was in tears and I ended up walking out and slamming the front door, leaving my mates to deal with my mother.  Bad of me, I know, but keep in mind all of my alcohol had been consumed at that point. :P So anyway, A runs after me and I proceed to embarrass myself with retellings of a neglected childhood and shite.  Anyway, he talked me into coming home, where he and Ian decided it was best to leave and I put Meumann to bed in the spare room.  (Wow, this is turning out to be quite long!)  Yes. Well. Saturday just consisted of a long overdue Maccas run, a shopping trip I really didn't need, feeling terrible for my friend Pheebs who got ripped at a party she went to on Friday and had the guy of her dreams tell her the next morning that they were "just friends", went to see Van Helsing which freaked me out incredibly because of those fucking vampires, and then went to Scotties... I was just sooo tired though, so I ended up coming home really early!  And yet still, not much sleep that night because Hami decided he felt the need to come over and talk to me until 2.30am and explain why he'd been acting like a dick to me all night. Men... fucking men, they're so confusing!   Anyway, after shit all sleep, I went to work all day yesterday, and then to my Dad's for tea with Bec, and got another night with shit all sleep and have been at school all day. This afternoon was another Edge arvo, I went on the radio again for an hour a day which is actually going to be a fortnightly occurrence from here on, Mondays 4-5(GMT+10) http://www.edgeradio.org.au for those of you who'd like a listen/squiz! And right now I've just got this strange... Regretful(?) feeling in me for some reason... Maybe it's because God knows why but I can't get Wil out of my head, or maybe its because Chutes will be going to Kakadu on Sunday and Ian to Japan on Thursday, and I'm really going to be feeling the stress of not having my outlets here for most of the holidays, or... I don't really know.  I just feel this strange regret sinking inside me and I don't know what its about.  Anyway, peace out guys, this has been one long frazzled entry about nothing in particular, so congrats to you if you actually read it!  Lotsa love, Sims xoxo

      *sighs* This is getting ridiculous.  It is approaching 5 Celsius outside, and i'm sitting here at the computer in a midriff top.  *blink* A midriff.  With no heater on.  Do I just not have a brain or something?! Obviously not, stupid question really, but that's all that we can expect from someone with no brain anyway, so it doesn't really matter. :P   Yes, well, anyway... tonight I went to a play at my school. It was called "After Juliet" (yes, you would be right if you saw the link between that and the title) and it was done by a bunch of people in my college sector... Phoebe was great in it, she always is, nothing but praise for the girl. *nods* I always feel bad for Peter though. I just can't help it, he's one of those people who, to put it in the words of the great Dr. Phil "just doesn't get it"! He stoopingly trudged onto the stage and said his lines with his half slobbery lisp and I just wanted to go down there and throttle him to make him wake up to himself.  He thinks he's going to NIDA.  He's not.  I'm no expert, nowhere near, but there will be no NIDA for that boy. *le sigh* It's terrible, he's so sweet, I just... oh God, I don't know what I just. He is sweet, but also very very weird... sweet and weird... weird in a scary way too...  Another thing about another cast member from After Juliet; a guy I will refer to solely as "A" for the purpose of keeping things simple. I just don't get him.  Granted, I mostly don't get any guys in general, but him especially! He's not the best looking guy in the world, no one in their right mind would deny that, but he's just got soooo much... charisma? I guess the word is? He's downright cheeky too. :P Like tonight, he came over to our group, so I hugged him and told him what a great job he did - which he of course already knew but accepted my compliment graciously.  But of course it wasn't just a hug, he held onto me, he held my hands and kissed them, he touched my face, and he is the only guy in the world that can get away with pinching my butt in public. *laughs* I've got no idea how or why but he has this ironic knack of being able to make you seem really special and important, when he'll literally go and do exactly the same thing to another girl a minute later! He's charming and funny, and all the while completely enfuriating... *sighs* I guess A is a topic for another day though, because i'm determined to figure him out. *nods*  Also another topic for another day, the issue/tough sitch i've gotten myself into with a guy we'll call Blondie and another we'll call Blackie (ha! Forgive my lame sense of humour. :P), the gossip that's going around about me and getting me down, and the strange, quirky, upbeat-down Gushie who is on my mind for a number of reasons.  Lotsa love n such, Simbles xoxo

      Today is a crappy Tuesday.  There really is no other way to describe it, the weather is positively shite, my mood is totally down, and even the vibe from the walls is making me feel like the yellow paint is turning gray, so on this crappy Tuesday I have decided to create my own wittle blog.  Yes, that's right, in the midst of a depressing Tuesday I actually found some inspiration to do something.  Weird, eh? Must just be because there is absolutely positively nothing else to do right now.  Or something... *ahem*  Right now, I'm having the most frustrating conversation ever over MSN with my ex-boyfriend... He really needs to grow up.  I'm trying to explain an emoticon to him - yes, that's right, an  emoticon  - and he is arguing for the sake of arguing and basically saying "you're shit wrong, I win". He doesn't even  argue  properly!  And as if he "wins" anything! Good lord... How frikking annoying.   Anyway, moving onwards and upwards to better and less annoying things, I always wonder what it is that people put into these things... I've started a couple before and they've all just fizzled out and faded away because I've got nothing of any importance to say really, nothing that I'm happy letting people I know hear about, and nothing that people I don't know feel the need to read... bleh.... I think I might sign out now, and come back when I've got some more inspiration!  Bunches of love n such, Simbles xo

      Ick... tired... the tiredness... *dies*  Well, my mother is back. :P And to tell you the truth, my last minute clean-the-whole-house-of-all-remnants-of-Thursday-night-party-in-two-hours dash was something that I thought would be succesful! But, as it happens, I failed dismally and she knew within the first half hour of being home. Fuck. Oh well, at least she didn't find out until she'd given me the new coat she bought me in Queensland! (Sucker!)   Oh crap, speaking of the woman, she just came out here and said "What happened in my room?" With the meanest ugliest face you've ever seen in your entire life.  And i'm thinking, 'shit, she saw the wax all over the bathroom...' but no, she reminds me that her lamp is broken, and she's found a glass with a crack in it.  Oh yes, I failed completely dismally... i've got no idea about the glass, but the lamp - it got broken when Al took a flying leap over the bed and smacked her hand through the shade! Crap. I'm so screwed. Byebye nice new coat! *sigh* I would've thought she could at least be nice to me for the first night she got back...  Hum... yes well, anyway, with the return of my mother also comes the crappy return of school. The last thing in the world that I want or need right now... i'm already stressing about it, I just don't need this shit in my life right now! Seriously, if this wasn't my final year, and there weren't only a few months to go... I just wouldn't go back. I hate it.  I loathe it. I despise it with a passion. Dear God, just give me a break and get me out of this hell!!!

      Yep. Weird topic for an entry, trust me, I know... I can't help it though, last night I went to Eden, a new club in town that was completely dead and is formerly known as "Lalaland" the main gay bar of our tiny little city.  And God knows what happened, its not supposed to  be  a gay bar anymore, but as it happens Bec and myself were the only straight women there. *blink* Uh huh... It was the minute I saw a blonde girl going the country mile with another chick right at the bar when the words "Girl! I wanna take you to a gay bar, I wanna take you to a gay bar, I wanna take you to a gay bar gay bar gay bar" got into my head, and now for the life of me it won't get out!   So I'm randomly walking around, humming the tune in my head and it got me thinking. It's not that great a song, but dear God is it catchy! I mean, seriously, it's not often than you can get a room full of people screaming out "I wanna take you to a gay bar", especially when half of the people in the room are homophobic men. :P   Ugh, anyway, clubbing last night, interesting experience. *nods* As I mentioned earlier, started out at Eden and seeing as Dave's buy 2 get 1 free deal seemed to be holding out, I ended up getting incredibly trashed as did my beautiful sister, and then heading out to Surreal, where we somehow managed to fluke getting in on the same ID. :P Anyway, we danced, we drank and we decided that in our very drunken states at about 3.30am we should probably head home! So off we went, getting myself home at around 4... and then calling Mark which was the strangest experience I've ever had.  So weird, he's so innocent, and so Christian, and yet at 4am he's talking incredibly dirty and telling me he'd reconsider his "virgin til marriage" status if I wanted him! *dies* What the?!?!!?! Wow, so strange... and I'm not even going to go into details about the rest of it, it's like... meh... yeh, so strange though.  He confuses me so much, half the time I think he must be doing a Tane, as in telling me the things I want to hear for the sake of not rocking the boat, and then other times he's just so sweet and sincere, I can't imagine why on Earth he'd ever say something to me that wasn't the complete truth.  And then of course he does dumb things like tell me that I'm beautiful.  What kind of person does that? What the hell are you supposed to say to that? Oh gee thanks, I know I am. :P I hardly think that would go down well.  And when I say "no I'm not, you don't need to say things like that" he gets shitty about it!  So what the fuck are you supposed to say?! Grrr...  God dammit I want the fucking boards to go back up.  I have been waiting. *taps foot impatiently* for like days. And it is fucking well time for them to go back up. Yes. Now. Right now.  And I'm still confused about men... Tom, ugh, just  leave me alone mate.  I love you to bits when you aren't following me around like a puppy! Hamish... Well he just confuses me completely.  He tells me he's in love with me and then acts like nothing happened.  John, hrmm... let's just not go there.  Mark. Nuff said.  And Wil, ever-lingering in my thoughts...  Okay, this is totally just procrastination its 12.17am, I have to work in the morning, and my house is a shitheap that I need to clean before my darling (yeah right) mother returns from her trip with her man, and there is absolutely no logical reason for me to be writing this right now other than the fact that I am the best procrastinator in the whole wide world.  Go me.  Ugh, I'm going to post this damn thing and at least do the washing up.  I haven't been able to drink for the past few days because we have no cups, so I think that's a good idea!   Lots of love n such, and do yourself a favor.  Go to a gay bar gay bar gay bar. ;) Sims xoxo
