      Hey, got some feedbacks regarding yesterday's post.. First, my decision about not believing in love has got nothing to do with his death. Second, i'm not gonna turn lesbian when i say im gonna close my doors for all boys. Third, IF there are guys out there who can make me believe there is such a thing called "mutual love" in this world, then by all means i might even try to open my doors back.. Well, not that i Know of any one.. Muahahaha.. Yah, today erm nothing unusual happened.. Saw to his funeral.. Tomorrow, im working 2-6pm so at leats there's activity.. So, guys i'll update You ppl again aitz? ==OUTZ==   *When u're in love, it's a beautiful day.. But when u're not, it always seems a rainy day..*

      Haiz ppl.. Ermm.. As you can see from the heading, its a sad day for me.. Haiz, but wad to do, whoever that lives must die one day.. And one more thing.. It is from today onwards that i am gonna close my heart for any guys.. Well, not that any boys want me rite.. Wad i mean is that I Kinda dun believe in mutual love anymore.. Cos all my life, in my 17 years, it has always been one sided love... unrequited love.. And the heavier side has always been me... Hahakz.. Hey~ Cut dat snicker off ur face... I've always been on the heavy side okayz.. So, gonna end here.. Erm, so anything, just post ur comments yah.. ==OUTZ==

      Its been such a long time i'm feeling like dis.. I've never felt like dis in ages man.. Gosh! Actually, i knew dis guy since March, i think.. We've never met and our realationship was jus based on casual SMSes and long chats over the phone.. Then, he went into a new school.. Something happened.. He went steady wid someone who happened to be one of my good friends.. Haiz, at that point of time, emotions were raging... Upset!Dissappointed!Sad! Everything.. I was feelin fuckin lousy at that time because i tot hey, i knew him first, NOTHING HAPPENED... but they just got to know for a few weeks and they're like talk of town.. It was So damn unfair! But when i tot back, hey I SHOULDN'T BE FEELING LIKE THIS.. Cos, that girl is my fren.. I should feel happy for her..  Then, just yesterday, i heard they broke up.. I was so Happy! I felt mean cos i noe i shouldn't be doing this.. But to noe dat he was single again, i didn't even cared!! But, HE.. Would he ever fall for me?! NO! WHY?! Cos i'm FAT n UGLY RITE???!!!  I just wanted him to noe how i'm feeling right now.. But its so DIFFICULT for me to do so!!! Restricted by a lot of barriers!!I'm so ashamed of myself.. I just dunoe wad to do!!!!!!  Dis is wad i meant by wanting something damn badly although knowing that i WILL and CAN NEVER GET till i die... Just FUCK Life...  So, Where's The Religious me???? I dunoe! So ashamed of myself.. So ashamed to face God...    **Yet Another Beginning of an UNREQUITED LOVE**
