      Today is another "first day" - I put up a few links that I either a) find handy or b) like, because I can either relate or they just plain cracked me up.

      It is finally Friday. Has anyone else been suffering through this seemingly 14-day week? Sheesh. Someone put me out of my misery and take me out with a tranquilizer dart already. Just let me enjoy my weekend first and make sure it has enough drugs to keep me down from next Monday to next Friday.   But, it's been a relatively good day. No downward spirals or wallowing in despair - that's the way we like it, me, myself and I. Me and Zoloft - what a team!

      Do you know who "they" are? You know, "'They' say you aren't supposed to do that" or "'They' say you have to, or you'll get in trouble". I once knew someone who had a big poster hanging in her office. It was the word "THEY" in all caps, using a thick typeface, with the classic 'no' red circle and diagonal line through it. Pure wisdom.   In my endless pursuit for answers to life, I found that I don't like what "they" say is right and what "they" expect of me. How does someone become comfortable with doing what they want to do, and not following the so-called rules? I'm not talking about a reckless disregard for other people's feelings or thoughts here, I'm talking about a little self caring and kindness.   Who do "they" think they are, anyway?

      I'd like to share an article which recently appeared in a special interest publication native to the Midwest. I want to make sure I'm giving all the proper credits, hopefully I'm not missing anything here. The article, called "Cry Me A River"  was written by Jon Gaskell of Cityview. It appeared in the 'Opinion' section, but unfortunately I'm not sure which issue it was. At a minimum, I found it very thought provoking. Here it is.        "Goddamn I'm sick of your bitching and moaning. Yeah, you. Shut up for just one second Can you? Will you? It's all you ever do, you know. You're like Charlie Brown's teacher. No one really hears you, and they definitely don't know what it is you have to say. Wa-wa-wa-wa. Why so, you ask? Because it never stops. Verbal diarrhea. Wipe your potty mouth. It's the same old shit anyway. And the sad thing is that if you'd stop for a second and try to oil that squeaky wheel on your own, you might actually get from here to there. Too easy, you say. Think again?         Bush lied? That's what politicians do. Think Nader is going to keep the Democrats out again? Quit voting for him. Your kid's gone to war, being shot at? That's what he signed up for. Unsatisfied with your leaders? Run for office - or, at the very least, vote.        Worried about the earth? Plan a tree and quite driving SUVs. Don't want your kids to be molested by priests? Stop going to church. Your people are being blamed for killing Jesus? Get over it. It was a long time ago. Besides it was just a movie - not to mention, he forgave you already.        Don't like homosexuals? Don't hang around them. Gay and want to be married? Sorry, the law says nope. Unsatisfied with your leaders - whoops, we've covered this.        Car insurance going up? Ride the bus. Hate paying property taxes? Rent. Not getting your fair share? Get off your ass and get to work. Oh, can't find a job? Lower your standards and look harder.        Your kids' school sucks? Move. TV screwed them up. Turn it off. They can't read. They're fat. They're stupid. You want to know what else they are? Smaller versions of you, you ignorant, obese, illiterate fuck. Take some responsibility and then take the joystick out of their hands. It's not the state's fault, or the school district's or God's. It's yours.        Nothing to do? Change the way you're looking at things. Your friends are no fun? Get some new ones. Have a gambling problem, addicted to meth, like little girls a little too much? Stop it. It's called exercising some self control. A disease, you say? I'll give you a disease. A disease is cancer, eating away at you until there's nothing left but skin and a soft, sad look that is screaming: "let me go!"        Your wife left you? Your husband's sleeping with his secretary? Your boyfriend thinks your ass looks fat? Nobody wants to have sex with you? Move on. There are plenty of fish in the sea. If there were not, people wouldn't say it.        Life isn't fair? Try harder.        Because as far as I can tell, the people who think things are tough all over are the people who aren't tough enough to change them. Remember, coffee is for closers. Actions speak louder than words. It's just that you've become content with speaking your mind and then moving on to what's bothering you next.        Don't.        You have the opportunity to do something meaningful. Start your own revolution. No matter how small it might be, it's better than the converse. It's better than just talking about it. It's better than just being bugged, and being satisfied simply knowing that you are. Life is about not getting what you want and dealing with it. No kidding.        I mean, ask yourself why you care so much. With a little reflection, I'll bet you figure out that you probably don't, or you'll figure out it's worth doing something about. Just shut up about it already. Everyone's sick of it.        And for the love of God, quit suing everyone. You burned yourself with hot coffee because you were trying to drink it and drive and the same time."

      Gas...brake. Eeeeease on the gas again, jack on the brake. Just a little more gas, then we brake again. If you were behind me on that long stretch of road that goes through downtown, you could not have enjoyed this any more than I did.   But, if you're the guy that was behind me after we got off that long stretch of road, I'm pretty much certain you would rather have been the other guy. Thinking we had only one block to stop-go-stop-go through, neither of us anticipated the  jackass  in front of me that decided to, erring on the side of caution (I'm giving the benefit of the doubt here) go ahead and STOP before making a right hand turn on a green light.   A few seconds after the sickening THUD, I looked in my rearview mirror and realized what happened. (Visualize with me: a guy slapping his steering wheel while mouthing profanity, out of which I was able to make "God Damnit!") For the record, I was none too happy either.   Half an hour later, I was getting a lecture from my significant other. Two hours later, I was telling him - just because, well... you know,  HE NEVER ASKED  - "Oh, by the way... I'm okay."

      I read about the most interesting thing. I believe - apologies for the sketchy details - that this is supposed to be some sort of unexplained phenomena or an urban legend or something like that. Apparently, at twenty minutes after the hour, there is supposed to be an eerie silence. It's tied to an historical event - again, apologies here... I'll try to post a link for more "real" information on this subject - that occurred at (yep, you guessed it!) twenty after the hour.   Urban legend or no, people like me - who are unfortunate enough to act as the universal lightening rod for shitty luck* - are the ones who will inexcusably and invariably do something during that "quiet time" that can not go unnoticed.   Believe in that eerie silence at twenty after the hour? You bet I do. Yesterday, during that eerie silence which occurs at twenty after the hour, I farted. Audibly.   Signed,  *ULRFSL

      A very uneventful morning so far... it has been a borderline recipe for whining about the sheer boredom of it all, really. So far, have had my required 20 oz. of coffee and two smokes. The most exciting thing I've encountered today is the little waxy, chocolate covered donettes I bought for breakfast. And even those are lacking, I'm not kidding when I say waxy.   I really try to be a reasonable person, even though keeping a hold on all the silly thoughts that float around in this head of mine seem to get out of control. I have spent so much time lately, letting myself dream about what I really want. Dreaming is a great escape, but coming back to reality bites. Lately I have been feeling trapped, there are so many things I want to do and places I want to go and it's just not proper for someone like me.    Why can't things just be simple?

      Seriously. My son - who is two years and four months old - just brought a store receipt to me. With one exception, he pointed out all the letters in the word 'mart' to me. He did say "N" instead of "M" but that's a pretty common kid mistake.   Arrrrr! I am  all that is woman .   Except that I  clearly  don't know shit about code. I tried my hand at posting a link in the first paragraph. I blew, as the linkless paragraph indicates.   --------------------------------------------------------------  It's Friday night, and here I sit watching Nickelodeon. Oddly enough, I'm happier right at this very moment than I have been in a long time.

      Okay, so maybe that's a little over the top. But I have an idea, and anyone whose pet peeve is stupid driving peers will enjoy it.   In our state, the lottery ticket machines have an electronic message board with (I'm assuming) programmable scrolling messages. Roughly, the size of this message board is 6 inches tall, and maybe 3 feet wide.   So, my thought is, get a heavy duty magnet or suction cups to hold this nifty little invention on the top of my car, and it could become a communication device for at least one frustrated driver. I wish constantly for this invention. If I had "fuck you" money, some of it would be dedicated to fulfilling this dream.   This morning, I wished for one of the message boards YET AGAIN. Speeding to work on the interstate, I was tailed - and I mean the kind where I could barely see their bumper - for a good two miles. Never mind the fact that this jackass had plenty of lanes to choose from - three at one point, and five at another point (all within this two mile stretch, mind you).   So, as I was wishing for my sign again this morning, I decided that one of my programmed messages will be:   I BRAKE, YOU BUY IT.

      Day 2 of vacation: 3 of 5 are in the pool when we discover there is a "CLOSED FOR MAINTENANCE" sign posted. 2 of 5 VERY disappointed. Actually, 'disappointed' is a gross underestimation of the emotion expressed; to illustrate, we'll say there were tears. With sobbing.   I'm going to shut myself in the studio. Where's my little buddy?

      I'm not the first person to wonder, but why does time slow down or speed up in the opposite direction you wish? My four days of vacation starts at 5:00 tonight, and I swear time is draaaaaaaaaaging just to piss me off.   Speaking of a ticking clock: here's a little piece of etiquette for those that need it. If we both know I'm trying to plan my vacation, and we both know that I'd like to set aside some time to spend with you during said vacation, how about you go out on a limb and let me know what  your  plans are? Since I've only asked about 300 times.

      How ironic. No, let's call this one a coincidence. Today's horoscope: "You have a game plan. Now the game itself, and all the rules, have changed."   Don't get me wrong, I don't plan my life around my horoscope, or consult the stars every time I make a trip to the can. But considering I spent the larger part of last week thinking, and coming up with that very game plan, I can honestly say I wasn't surprised. How nice that I'm in tune with the universe. :c)   ----------------------------------------------------   Overheard at dinner last night - issued by a very frustrated two-year-old, first-time spork (those half fork/half spoon inventions) user, as his fork stuck to the foam bowl and flung food all over the table, and issued ever so quietly under his breath - "DAMMIT".   No, I didn't let him see me laugh. But it was with great effort that I got my head turned before I did so.

      Wackiness: 50/100  Rationality: 46/100  Constructiveness: 56/100  Leadership: 68/100   You are an SECL--Sober Emotional Constructive Leader. This makes you a  politician .    (WTF, I say!)    You cut deals, you change minds, you make things happen. You would prefer to be liked than respected, but generally people react to you with both. You are very sensitive to criticism, since your entire business is making people happy.   At times your commitment to the happiness of other people can cut into the happiness of you and your loved ones. This is very demanding on those close to you, who may feel neglected. Slowly, you will learn to set your own agenda--including time to yourself.   You are gregarious, friendly, charming and charismatic. You like animals, sports, and beautiful cars. You wear understated gold jewelry and have secret bad habits, like chewing your fingers and fidgeting.   You are very difficult to dislike.  &nbsp;    So says  this  test... catch me on the road.

      Kalyn* was driving home from work Tuesday night, with her infant in the car, a very stupid man was riding her bumper. So much, in fact, that she thought this guy would try to pass her on the shoulder of the road.   (Let me interject here: Kalyn and I are very much alike in almost every aspect. Neither of us messes around getting from Point A to Point B, so when someone is riding our ass, it's much more than just a little annoying. Top it off with an infant in the car, and that motherly/protective instinct kicks in. You should know, it doesn't matter what anyone looks like, or weighs, or how much of a threat they seem to pose when they aren't angry - motherly instinct cancels out all other details and should make any human on the receiving end   VERY   afraid. Suffice it to say, it can get ugly, quickly.)   As luck would have it, a red light stopped the trip's progress (assault). The gods of luck went one step further, and had this fine gentleman pull up in the lane right next to my sister. Kalyn rolled down her window, stuck her head out and motioned for him to do the same. The guy did as she asked, and leaned over to see/hear her.   She said - very succinctly, I might add; my heart is  still  swelling with pride - "I have a  BABY  in my car, motherfucker." To which this fine gentleman replied, "You have a speeding problem." She retorted, "Um, apparently I don't since it was  YOU  riding  MY  ass. Did you hear me when I said I have a baby in my car,  motherfucker ?"   Moral of the story: Don't mess with this chick. In fact, don't piss me off either. We'll team up and head your way. Trust me, you don't want to go toe to toe with the spitfire duo.  &nbsp;   *Standard disclaimer: names changed to protect the innocent (blah blah blah).

      What I want to know is, why has there been a run on auditions for the B Squad? Did someone run an ad in the paper? Is there a scarlet letter on my person visible to everyone but me?   Don't get me wrong. I'm quite flattered by the attempts.&nbsp;A few intriguing individuals are "in" or have almost made it: Czec*, Irish*, Indian*, Nean*, Ben* and Red*.&nbsp; There might be a couple others I'm forgetting.  &nbsp;  Czec is, as always, Czec. Occasionally, we have joked about the validity of "incurable insanity" as a reason for separating. In the words of Karen*, "It's funny because it's true." &nbsp;   Irish is in-fucking-credible. I think Stevie Nicks knows him too, I am certain that she wrote the song "Magic Man" about him. That is, of course, my own personal opinion.&nbsp; So far, I like what I know of him, but the things I can't figure out, and he doesn't seem to want to lend a hand with, hold me back.  &nbsp;  Indian is one of most captivating men I've met in a long time. I think he senses what I do, and am sure he knows I could find myself knee deep in a crush. I don't think he wants that, at this point in time. I value the friendship greatly, and can overlook the chemistry.  &nbsp;  Nean&nbsp;surprises me often... just when I think I've figured him out, he throws me for a loop. So far seems to be genuinely nice, but I remain curious about the agenda.  &nbsp;  Ben has always been pure chemistry. One of those that, you know, everything else aside, you could romp for hours and still have it in you for more.  &nbsp;  Red is so young. Nice to look at, and certainly in shape for a go of it. I think though, the brains are still&nbsp;located a little closer to the nether region than the "thinking" head.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Stevie*, my boy, will always be one man in my life. That one is special, let me tell you. Unlike any other I've ever encountered.  &nbsp;    *Standard disclaimer: names changed to protect the innocent (blah blah blah).

      One day closer to payday, which is good. Week seems to be dragging again, which gets old.   Concert event to look forward to: next month I get to see Nickelback  urlLink http://www.nickelback.com &nbsp;in concert. I absolutely can not WAIT! Puddle of Mudd is opening for them, which is a great fit. I can't decide whether to wear a cute strappy tank, or something with a bra that I can throw onto the stage. :c) I welcome votes from all (what, 2?) of my readers. [Author's note: if that seems like a shameless ploy for affirmation, it sort of is - I often wonder if anyone reads this blog at all. It's not imperative, I'm writing here anyway and I love it. I just wonder if anyone else enjoys it as well.]   My heart is still overflowing with love today - for Indian and Irish* both. &nbsp;    *Disclaimer: all names changed to protect the innocent (blah blah blah).

      For probably the one thousandth time, I noticed on my way to work that some people can't seem to follow directions. I don't mean the "turn left on Carter St, go two blocks and look for the yellow house on the right" kind of directions. I'm talking about the kind where, you send in your license and registration for the upcoming year, they send the "05" sticker back to put on your license plate.  Clear as a bell and sure as shit,  every  year in my envelope from the DOT, they include directions on where to position the latest sticker on your license plate.   NOWHERE   on the directions I get, does it say to position the next to each other around the edge of the license plate so that other drivers can get an overview of your vehicle registration at a glance.  Put the sticker on TOP of the previous year's, idiots. It's the only year of registration anyone gives a shit about.

      In just two visits, Dr. Davis has brought about some interesting points. I mean the kind where it's like a stopper has been pulled from the cogs, and the wheels in my head started spinning away immediately.  The first one is interesting, lurking right at the surface and not terribly deep; rather, I think I would have preferred NOT to acknowledge the idea, whether or not it is/was true. We were discussing J's declining my request to be adopted. Dr. D asked why that bothered me, and my response was that I didn't know. She challenged me, saying something to the effect of "Oh, come on now." Hellooo... abandonment and rejection? It was the beginning of respect.  The second point was another startling realization. Dr. D asked what age my mother was when she died. As I was answering with a range of numbers (34 to 37, I thought) I realized it was almost the age I am now. Wow, that one struck a chord. It sorta makes a few of the puzzle pieces come together.

      I started this blog as a way to de-pressurize, examine my thoughts and feelings and speak out about them anonymously, and maybe make new friendships based on thoughts or input from people who might read it.  Another good thing about this space, is the capability to vent on an as-needed basis. Today, I need it. I'm not going rationalize why, or what I want to say, I'm just going to say it and feel good about getting what I want off my chest.  Irish*, this one's for you:  I'm sick of your bullshit. No more invitations to sit down and talk. No more invitations to do lunch. Make up your fickle mind, and let me know what you decide. Until then, fuck off.  Yep, I feel better. :c)    *Names changed to protect the innocent (blah, blah, blah - even if you do make my blood boil!).
