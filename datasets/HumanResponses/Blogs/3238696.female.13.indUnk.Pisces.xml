      We officially have only 2 days left until the last day of school. Yeahhhhhh! Today was so funny because I was doing my extra credit project in reading with Paige and Brianna, so we went up to do our report on "Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone," I read that book like a bajillion years ago. Well anyways we went up and I had to go first since I was Harry Potter and I had these pimpin glasses on(no not really they looked stupid). Then I tried to do the british accent and my line was "Hello! My name is Harry, Harry Potter," then I embarrassed myself so bad because I burst out laughing cause my voice sounded so corny. Oh well... I did good otherwise. I had to wear a gay dracula cape though and this gay red top, but I took the shirt off cause Abel and Josh kept laughing at me. To end the school year I'm havin a pool party, but I'm only inviting 3 people cause I feel like it. I saw Shrek 2 yesterday and that was soooooooooo funny. We drank some magic potion and now we're sexy! Donkey and Shrek looked so different after they drank the potion. Shrek's line "Do you still know the muffin man?", brang me back to the first movie of the gingerbread man's famous lines. Well in the yearbook I look like crapolla and today danielle got dissed cause I could do a better bridge then her...and she was makin fun of me cause she said I would probably be tired out after  got on the ground and I wouldn't be able to do it. Well I proved her wrong. William kicked me in the shins where I had bruises all over them already. So I got him back and I stuck jollyrancher on his back especially after the coment he made the comment to cassidy "... her fat ass just can't wait to eat that jollyrancher" well I didn't eat it I licked it and stuck it on his back. Haha. He shouldn't be talking since he has got man boobies on the front and back and they are bigger than his stomach which will devour you if you get near him. What a fat fuck. Well I guess I'll write again tommorow if I can. Time for bed. Goodnight.
