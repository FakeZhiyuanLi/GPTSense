             Yeah..Yeah..Yeah..Today was absolutely a Happy Day for us..We dont celebrate this month as he was so Busy regardin' his work..Hahaha..At night around 10pm we meet under my void deck..First thing he usually do when meetin' me is to Kiss me on my Forehead and hug me tightly..Feel warmness and could smell his scent of perfume his usin'..He really Turn me On..Hahaha..Spend our night sittin',laughin',findin' for stars and pampered one another..How I wish that everyday could be the same as yesterdae..Around midnight he send me home because his workin' the next day..Work hard okay Sayang..I'm sorry that I never see U walkin' away infront of my bedroom..Totally Miss a chance to wave at U and give U a Flyin' Kiss..Next time tell me earlier that U are walkin' infront of the carpark..I will definitely wait for U..After reachin' home he give me a phone call..We talk for awhile and went to bed early..So tirin'..Haha..~Work hard to get Engaged soon with Me!!So Sweeeeet of him..Hehehe..We plan to get Engaged in 3 Years time..Isn't that fast??Not that Desperate but we don't want to Lose each other..Hahaha..No matter what I hope that I won't Lose him and I Really Love him so much..After we had a little quarrel me received message from him..Still remember his Sweetest message to my Hp on (03 October 2003)~(22:27:26)..He send me "Mornin' come & go just like that we dont realise, you and me are meant to be together and forever and not like da mornin' rain that remind us da pain we share"..   To: My Handsome Dear,  Dear, the moment I realize, now, looking through your Beautiful eyes, there will be same surprises waiting to arise.  I miss the way you look at me with such sparkle and so much glee, U hugs me tight, U kisses me wild, and U makes me out of mind,  When we walked together, hand in hand, it seemed to me. I ruled The land, this poem is from me to you because; I realized u loved me true.  True love is something special, and such a treasure to find, we can’t taste It, smell it, priceless money can’t buy. To be truly in love is to be worthy of love.  Through dedication and trust, only the heart shall reveal, but words and Action can’t express the way true love feels. “I LOVE YOU”.  Whenever you express your love quote to me, I feel my life is so beautiful And so sparkling like a star, I enjoy myself being every moment with you.  I’m like a bird with wings which can fly where ever I want with you, to explore Together true love, a true lover builds not a pedestal but a place from which to soar.   Dear, u are there when I ‘m in need help, I love you not only for what you are But for what I am when I am with you,  I don’t know how long exactly I can be free and spent my life with you, In time I’ll keep remember your smile and tenderness of your touch in my mind,                                                                                          Love, Sweetie Shasha
