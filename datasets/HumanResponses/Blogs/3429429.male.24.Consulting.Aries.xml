      Yea, so it's like this. I have a crush on my BOSS. She's kinda sweet, sexy and cool, and i am not the only one who thinks so. Alas, she is attached, though... butttttt, she's in a long distance relationship. SO... hmmm, i am thinking, whether i should be el Bastardo, and try to "spanar" (a malaysian term for relationship breaking) her away from her current boyfriend... Hell, i would have no issues in doing that, since i do not know her boyfriend directly.. But, now i am like thinking whether there would be more to lose and less to gain. Right about now, she is one of the only reasons i am actually staying with my job. It is kinda satisfying working under her as she's very supportive and doesn't give me a hard time when i fail to meet deadlines.. However, emotions aside, she is still my boss and if i really do manage to hook up with her, there will be just so many negative issues.. However, in her eyes, i am still a subordinate, needing guidance and i guess i will have to grow up in her eyes before she can actually view me as an equal, i guess... Our age gap is like only a year though. hmmm.. well, any comments? I know that this site does not attract much attention, but surfers who do visit, i appreciate some feedback.

      Right, A-levels went by so fast and i studied social sciences. To cut it short, in 1999, i graduated from my college with an E in economics, a B in accounting, and a C in math. SHYTE results ain't it? However, as luck would have it, i got accepted into a local college with an overseas twinning programme with a uni in UK. I met up with a new batch of friends in 1st year uni, they were a good bunch, but when all of us went together overseas to study, our true colours really shone. Let me tell you a story of 5 friends, of which including me, 3 were guys, in UK, we stayed apart in our respective university halls of residence. So, over the course of my studies abroad, i found that the girls turned out to be gold diggers and opportunists, 1 guy turned out to be a moocher and to this date, he still owes me money, another guy, i am still on rather good terms with, he is currently "so called" working for his father, lazing around the house and still mooching off his parents. Now comes the interesting bit about me during university abroad. I experienced many firsts overseas.. My first kiss, my first blowjob (no, it wasn't from a prostitute!), my first fuck (no, it wasn't from a prostitute too!), my first visit to a porn shop, my first visit to a gentlemen's club (i subsequently went back twice. :P) ahh my first lap dance, my first visit to a casino. Well to sum it up, i had a fucking BLAST, and my studies suffered. As a result, i failed to achieve the desired credits to graduate University. PANICK set it. I was fucking depressed. My family had set such high hopes on me, and all i did was to disappoint. The worst cut was that they had already purchased tickets for my graduation all the way from Malaysia.. Now we are not a well off family, and i felt like shit.. However, never once did i contemplate suicide. That would be the easy way OUT! So, i worked out a deal with the Uni, i would sit for 2 resits, of which i had to pass one subject, and i would be on my way to get a degree. Now the resits were in early august, so i had some time to spare to concentrate on my studies. To my defence, all my vices were all commited after i had completed my resit papers, and not one cent came from my parents money. I worked in a sweat shop illegally, used my wages for the er... activities mentioned earlier above. I got a tutor to help me for one of the subjects and under her tutelage, i managed to secure an extremely high grade for one of my resit papers, which proved to myself that i am not stupid, i just lack guidance (my original lecturer was a motherfucking useless piece of shit). In addition, i also passed the other subject with flying colours as well. Thank GOD, i passed.. I am usually not a religious man, but i do pray to the LORD occasionally...I do feel guilty as GOD should never be regarded as a 24-7 supermarket for faith. My family did come and visit me, and i brought them around UK, but the more supportive they were, the worse you feel, you know.. During the worst of times, i clung on to my family's picture to spur me on, to be better than i am, for i know that the support base will always be there, when i need them. So, people.... although your parents can be naggy, you know they will always forgive you and be there for you, even in times of desparation.  Right, to conclude, eventually, i returned home to Malaysia, lazed around for a couple of months, began job hunting and landed a job with my 1st interview. And i am still working at the same place ever since.

      Now please allow me to detail my last 2 years of formal education leading towards SPM. Right, Form 4 was initially quite alright, i got nominated to be a prefect in school, a supposedly desired position then.. Blechh... now that i think about it. I chose to pursue a pure science course which involved Biology, Chemistry and Physics..Hey all the smart kids were going to the sciences, the arts were reserved for the not so bright ones.. What stereotyping, right? Anyway, Breezing through a less than eventful year, we are now at Form 5. Now, being a prefect, Now this would be regarded a high honour, but with the discipline of the students being unruly and the weak support of the faculty (them teachers were scared shitless by some of the antics of certain bullies with money), discipline eroded, and gee who was to blame? The prefectorial board.. Okay, now i had to deal with pressures of responsibility, my studies suffered a little bit, i was having relationship problems to top it off. 1997 was really a horrible year for me. Add to that the Asian financial crisis which put a toll financially for my family, it really put me on the edge.. However, i did step up, but only to the best of my ability, and to this day, i felt that i should have done more. I know.. i know... i am not making much sense in the posting.. Only i will understand what i am typing. Please bear with me :) Right, now for the worst incident ever, i was involved in an auto accident, i was the driver, negative repercussions are still evident till this day. And you know what, till this day, i am reminded of the incident daily, not being to get on with my daily life. That incident truly changed my life in many ways, both positive and negative. On the positive side, i am a very careful driver now, for i know how horrible it is to be involved in such a situation, on the negative side, i am reminded daily of my mistake and i am unable to forgive myself over what happened... Like i mentioned, i am rather a sensitive person, sometimes the video runs over and over in my head, i am unable to concentrate and had a bout of mild depression. Although since then, i have been able to move on, but you know.. somethings just can't be forgotten.

      A little bit about me. I have been living in KL all my life now. I went to a government school when i was young and subsequently studied in a private school during my secondary school. After that, i studied A-levels at a local college and did a twinning programme to study overseas in the UK for about 2 years. Currently, after graduating (a story in itself), i am currently working in KL, trying my very best to earn a living and put those years of education to good use.   Studying in the government primary school had its moments, growing up, i was quite a sensitive child, easily provoked and emotional much to my parents and teacher's dismay. It was a bitter-sweet experience those first 6 years though. Before that, i was pre-schooled in Fatimah Kindergarten, along Jalan Ampang. Not much memories of that place but i do remember hating to board the "chicken" bus to go to kindergarten *shrugs*. The chicken bus was the designated bus for my housing area. Funny how you remember the little things.. Well the kindergarten, sadly is not operating anymore and is now a used car lot showroom. I will post a picture of it in the near future.  Fast forward to primary school. I was a pretty good student from primary 1 to 6, getting near perfect scores, excelling in the languages and the sciences, along with history. My achilles heels though were ART and music. I remember my silly art assignments which included paper mache' along with normal water coloured drawings, of which most of my assignments were completed by my mom. She was a great sport helping me finishing up my art projects earning my rather presentable grades. Now the music bit involved playing the recorder (a flute like instrument) and being graded on how well you played. Well now that i think about it, my primary school was never about fun. I never excelled at sports, just in my studies. Teachers liked me, i knew the art of sucking up even at such a young age. Heh...   Now moving on towards secondary school. Now the first 3 years were magical, the next 2 were hell. It's gonna take a bit long to explain, but i'll just start with the first 3 years. Well due to my excellent grades in primary school, i was placed in the best class, with the so-called best students. I really enjoyed my first year in secondary school. I was never bullied, had good mates, both malays and chinese. I excelled in my studies as usual, got along well with teachers and classmates. That was the case for form 2 and form 3 as well. Ahh magical form 3, that was the year when i discovered GIRLS. Yes, i was 15 then, a bit of a slow starter *ahem ahem*. After the PMR examinations (which i subsequently aced by the way, 7As) we were left to our own muses, and interaction between sexes increased. I really enjoyed talking to this one girl, CY, because i felt we had a lot in common. She was the sweetest and cutest lil thing ever. ( so hey, i am biased.. I'm a nerdy 15 year old, remember ? :P) We talked about music and the world, and basically anything. I dunno, it kinda felt like the top of the world when we were talking you know. Alas, due to my lack of balls, i never did make a definitely move, and we drifted apart slowly as the years went by, along with the original chemistry which was there. Years later, when we chatted, she said that initially she did have feelings for me, and i will always kick myself for not reading the signals correctly. I would have wound up with my first girlfriend. Oh well, we are still keeping in touch, but i no longer feel the same way. So, moving on to greener pasteurs, it is. To be continued....

      I have tried several times to get a Blog up and running, but being ever the procrastinator, i have never got up and about to do it. However, today i am particularly free and thus i am now writing my first posting. Over the course of days and i hope months to share my strange story with the world. Cheers.

      Oh well, so a little update, the lady who was like *break-up, dun wanna break-up* decided to give her guy a 2nd chance, which leaves me out of the picture temporarily *shrugs*.. Oh well, either the dude will mess things up in his own way making way for me. Somehow, i thought that i would not have a problem being a bastard and just spanar her away, but somehow it's eating into my already tattered conscience. I dun wanna fuck her heart you know.. You gotta look at her perspective. It's so unfair for her to just leave the dude. Knowing her, her conscience will suffer and in turn, i might get the brunt. In the long term, i dun wanna be the rebound guy, cos more than often, that doesn't really work very well. And i am looking for the long term, not just short. Sometimes, i think i should settle for something less, but then again, the kiasu fuck in me will say, do a personal kaizen.. improve yourself, get harder, stronger, better and faster! Do not give up, do not slip up, if you do, you will never forgive yourself!  So, i guess i need to work on myself. MY goals now is to get fitter, stronger by building up better resistance towards colds via exercise and going to the gym. The next goal would be to learn how to dance. Incidentally one of my favourite dance films include Center Stage. Hahaha.. No i am not gAY.  SO be better than who i am, exceed my potential, i will feel so damn good! I just know it. Here's to the future.!

      You know what, it has been an interesting few days. Work is abit volatile, figures are coming in and out. It's either good or bad. We'll see. My boss broke up with her boyfriend, and she told me about it. Umm... it's so complicated now, or am i making it complicated for myself? I dun wanna be the one who gets her on the rebound. I mean, i do understand even though she broke up with the guy, she would be in a very volatile situation. I will make sure she doesn't do anything too rash and stuff. I mean we are quite close, we do talk rather often, but i do maintain abit of a distance during office hours. It's like we are close, but i just don't know what kind of closeness it is. But whatever it is, i need to step up, to mature into the man i am supposed to be, and fast... then i think i would be in a better position to win her affection. She has blatantly mentioned that office relationships are a no-no. But i am hoping to change that. Hmmm... we'll seee... any suggestions or tips?

      Dear Blog,   today was an alright day for me, i went to work, did what i was supposed to do, went for lunch at a japanese place, pretty cheap and nice (RM10), i had something like Japanese Chicken Curry rice, went back to work, waited for my appointment, left to visit the client, when suddenly out of the blue, a good samaritan rang me up and said that he had found my ID TAG at seri hartamas. Apparently it fell outside the door of this place, and one of the staff picked it up. Phew... i am oh, so relieved!   Am about to leave for a wedding in kuantan, will take some pics and post it up. FUck, i so don't wanna go kuantan yet. I wanna go and get my name tag back!. You can't imagine the fucking hassle i went through, just to get a replacement.  Anyways, laters, and i'll speak to you soon. (Note: i am not crazy, just referring to the BLOG as a third person) :P

      I am oh so confused right now, i like my boss, and i am getting so many mixed signals, i don't even know what to do. Sometimes, i just feel like i should just proceed and work my moves, other times, i feel that it would be so unprofessional for colleagues to date. I need to know how she feels about me, whether she's just using me as a substitute attention for her boyfriend or whether she's just waiting to be swept away. I see her, her eyes, her beauty, her sadness, her joy, her frustration. I want to help her, to help make it better, But i need to know how she rates me in her eyes, whether i am a subordinate or i am a potential boyfriend. I need to know how this pans out. It's driving me crazy...   So tired... Got back from work late, lost my security ID, FUCK! gonna need 4 weeks for a replacement ID. I am so irritated with myself. How could i fucking lose the tag. MAN.. it's been a shitty day!

      Just got a call from a mate of mine, who was sending off a gal he really liked at the airport. A bout of emotion overcame his senses and he needed to chat for abit. The Gal, T, was actually leaving for Manchester for studies. He had been seeing her for a few dates, but nothing conclusive ever worked out. Nevertheless, he bought a really sweet goodbye gift for her, a bracelet, accompanied by a romantic poem. She didn't expect a gift, so she was rather happy. I have met T, and she's a gem of a lady, nice shy and sweet, not my type, but overall very appealing to a lot of men. Now i was wondering, how love, attraction, hope, faith, heart all are part of our daily lives. Where one heart is broken, another somewhere out there finds love. Sure, it all depends, but hey, i sure hope to meet my soul mate one day, and i do believe in love at 1st sight.   It got me thinking, as to whether i should really try to sort out my own relationships. Like the earlier posts, i kinda got a thing for my colleague, but hmm... even pessimist lil' ol me thinks that there might actually be potential for development. But i guess a lot of sacrifice and effort would be involved if i actually went for it. I guess, i'll adopt a wait and see approach. Hey who knows, maybe she might feel the same way, but also has the same conflicting issues.   On a not so healthy note, I am sick. Damn it! A little background on my sinus problem. When i was in my early teens, i actually went for a tour in the states for 3 weeks, we did the east coast and west coast bit, and some parts were freezing due to winter, i sort of developed a cold which eventually became very serious and affected my sinusses. Scientifically speaking, my adenoids have been removed via surgery when i was young, i have a slightly deviated septum, and an antrochoannal polyp in my sinusses. Well, it all sounds scary, but it's not. In layman's terms, it means i have a slightly crooked nose and a small pouch of liquid along my sinusses. And i have been advised to get something done, but i have had enough of nasal surgeries. PTuuii... No way! So, right now, i have a cold and my sinus problem aggravates the whole situation. As a result, i am on a 5 day course of clarithromycin and i am using Beconase, a nasal spray to reduce the inflammation of my sinusses. I still feel like Shit today.. Uggghh, i hope to get better in a few days time. I do notice, i get a cold once every 3 months.. Dammit, i need to eat more ginseng and ester-C.

      After some months of contemplating as to whether to purchase a playstation, i finally went for it. And it cost me RM935, with my machine purchased from a shop in Sungei Wang. Now guys, although my tertiary educational background is in social sciences, i still remain a big fan of pure science (READ: GEEK) i know my chips, diodes, transistors, haha and what nots! Needless to say, i am also very technical when it comes to purchasing electronic items.  SO, without further a due,   PS2 Buying Tips    1. Model no. - SCPH5000X  - 5 series might have instabilities (optical lens issue, ask for the latest firmware) - PS2 latest versions:-  Version 9 - if you have SCPH-50000, 50001, 50002, 50003, 50004, 50006, or  50007 you have a v9 or v10 board.  Version 10 - SCPH-5000x, with date code "3D" to the right and below the  serial number on the back of the console. (GH-026 board)   Difference for SCPH-50000, 50001, 50002, 50003, 50004, 50006, or 50007:-   SCPH50000 - Japanese  SCPH50001 - Region 1 DVD - US, Canada  SCPH50002 - Region 2 DVD - Aus, NZ,   SCPH50003 - Region 3 DVD - UK, Europe  SCPH50006 - The Asian Version (also the one with the poorest Quality Control)  So as long as your version is SCPH5000X, then it is the latest version.  You just need to make sure your mod chip is good.   2. Modchip  - Messiah 3.2 : DVD movie- reset, turn on & hold power button few secs,     I know some shops still mod SCPH5000X version with Messiah 1 and 2. (They just charge you like RM600 bucks) It is better if you can get Messiah 3.2 mod chip on your  SCPH5000X. For me, I got Messiah 3.2. It can both play all  the games (DVD5 and 9), watch DVD (DVD 5 and 9) movies, play CD Audio and  play PS1 games. The only difference is that Messiah 3.2 is more  expensive.    3. DVD Games/movie playback  - always go for direct boot  - test with DVD games single/dual layer (GT Concept:geneva,  MGS2:substance), DVD movie 5/9, MP3, DivX movie,   4. Original PS2 joysticks - Look at the printed lines on the cable, they should have a very fine print. - Feel the analog joystick, it should be loose and stretchy - the colours of the action keys are dim, not shiny and does not fade even after you    slide your fingers roughly through it.   5. Power Supply - Depending on the type of machine you choose, 110V(US) or 240V (UK, Malaysia)   - PAL/NTSC  - different power supply, need power adapter ( stepdown regulator or even stepup)   6. Memory cards  - Black 8M with Magic Gate, manufacturing code behind, in plastic case   7. Free DVD games  - usually comes with 12 free dvd games ( Usually, the freebies at the shop are old games, so you have a better bet buying them by yourself, RM4 for D5 games, RM8 otherwise)  8. PS2s should be placed vertical, and not horizontal as it is easier for the lens to read the optical discs, as such, should the budget permit, buy a vertical support stand.  9. PS2s can play DVDs, but only do it occasionally, as it will ensure longer lasting lens. The reasoning is simple, when you play games, your lens will only read the disc while you progress to the next stage, while playing a dvd, the lens is working 100% for 2 hours. You do the math :)

      This weekend, she went over to visit her dude, who is back for a coupla days, sigh.... Hopefully things work out for the best.. ahem ahem.. for me. I still haven't given up. But, until recently, i have managed to hide my admiration to keep it clear from other colleagues, with the sole purpose of protecting her and me from unecessary rubbish jabs. But apparently, one very observant colleague has noticed a bit of tension, and before he started to hint, i downright challenged him (in a jokey, jovial manner of course) to come out straight. The fellow mentioned that he'd wait till i was in a bar or sumthin. Some dudes in my department are downright wonderful at lying, they have perfected it to an art. I need to perfect mine. So, how am i feeling now? I am calm, collected, without thinking too much into it. If she reconciles, then fine, if she doesn't, i won't be the rebound dude. I'd rather stay as a friend and colleague to build up the interest in me. After all, from a dude's standpoint, it's her interest level which matters more than his. I notice my expenditure.......... brb...

      Man oh man... this month has been shitty, i am feeling the pressure now. I tried my best today and it wasn't good enough, hence i feel that i have let myself down. Worst still, i did such a stupid thing today. It was immature and totally unprofessional. I let myself down, i let her down.. The only reason why i am still doing what i'm doing now.. if i really sit down and think about it is because i want to be with her, be near her. This is such a stupid reason, but i can't help it. My lines aren't construed properly. I need to pick up the pieces and push myself all the time, big time! I love watching smallville because it reminds me of the values i need to complete myself, truthfully, i am so empty. I hate myself for not being able to be the best. I set high goals for myself without even trying, for that i hate my own attitude. I must muster all courage and will to wallow through this down time. I need the support of my friends and just for a brief moment tonight, when i went out for dinner and dessert with my colleagues, it suddenly dawned in me. The people i am with at work are amazing. I know i will miss them loads if i leave. Never will i find such individuals who are supportive, sporting and caring. They kick me in the ass when need be,&nbsp;i know they will be there for me, irregardless. For this i must be stronger, i must reinvent myself. I need to push myself tomorrow.&nbsp;And you know what, i will finally sort out my life. All that is wrong!.... Dammit, i am angst today.. Bygones...&nbsp;

      As thoughts are fleeting in my head, i am thinking of several things. The other day, i supposedly failed a compliance report saying that i didn't follow correct procedures when consulting with the customer. What bollocks! I did everything properly, at least 80%. The rest was through ingenuity. Then due to my previous shit case, i did not have to prove myself again. Fucking compliance crap shit officer, the bird clearly has bird food for meals and is such a fuck. Right enuff&nbsp;of the expletives. Well, today was boreeeeeeng.&nbsp; Ahh.... bollocks. dun really feeel&nbsp;like talking about it! latazzzzzzzzzzzz

      Oh, crap.. I am so angst today. I dunno why. Nothing great has come out of today, man! Bad bad day. Lets start with morning, woke up late, reached office late. Then called to confirm my appointment today at 2pm in ss19. Fucker cancelled. No worries, then. So, right, after that i felt so irritated. I have a tendency to spend when i am feeling down and depressed. I dunno why.. Bitchiness in me i guess. Then went for lunch at jalan alor, fuck man.. lunch sucked, food sucked big time. Felt sleepy. Then actually, i am also quite close to another gal, Tee, who is a lovely pretty lady who is older than me. No romantic intentions there towards her though. She's a lovely person, pretty, smart, amazing, but not a challenge. Anyway, she's older than me like a few years, normally, it wouldn't be an issue, but she's just not my type. However, the bastard in me wants her for short term. But my morals and my heart won't let me go for the kill. She is on the rebound, after breaking off a long term relationship. With us colleagues around, she's slowly mending back her heart. Well, i hope for the best for her. I am still after the gal of my dreams.  Anyway, she's like being superficial at work. Understandably, i guess. I just can't get over the fact that she said i was too young for her. I dunno whether to confront her about it, or to build on the challenge to win her heart.. SIgh................ I dunno... we'll see i guess. Got 2 appts tomorrow, have to break off the Blog now.

      Well, nothing much happened at work today. I was all normal, and she was being herself, and i minimised contact. The key to building interest is also part resistance. The more wimpy i get, wanting to express my feelings, somehow i know the less my chances will be. Okay, so she mentioned that i am too young. So what, herein lies the challenge to change the perception. It's just whether i can step up or not.. I have to kill all my doubts, and gather all my courage, determination and perseverance.. Sometimes i think to myself whether all the hassle is worth it.. Should i just let it go? But i know this girl is one in a million. I just don't think i'll let go so easily. So begins the transformation from meek and mild me, to mature and confident me. Right... now to set reachable goals.  &nbsp; 1. Join the gym and take dance lessons to build confidence. 2. Improve my image.  3. Be daring, unpredictable and confident... &nbsp; &nbsp; Seee.... confidence is the key........ I really need to build it. &nbsp;

      So, it's been like a while since i posted anything. Even the Blogger engine has some tweaks now. Anyway, back to my never ending spanar saga. I picked her up from her place and we went to a club to meet up for a nite out with some colleagues.&nbsp; I was drinking loads, she was drinking and dancing. Well.. i tried to dance, but having two left feet doesn't exactly help things. So midway through buying drinks, she was well pissed and started leaning against me and said one damning sentence which reaffirmed my suspicions , "Maelstrom105, you are too young for me" All i could reply was in a condescending manner, "right.. (along with the look that says.. you've had a bit too much to drink..) But hello... the age difference is like a year, but in terms of maturity of thought and discipline, i do admit, i got some work to do in that area. So, now i am kinda in limbo.. I mean lets take a look from my standpoint first. She still with her boyfriend, but reiterated under sober conditions that she is still gonna break up with him.. just a matter of time.&nbsp;But, i do think we could be good together. I am quite honest and sincere about it. And i can now consider it a challenge to build an interest level for me in her. But at the same time, i am gonna keep my options open, i guess. Whatever it is, she's still senior at the workplace, and i am afterall a junior. More to lose, less to gain... So, i am now thinking. What can and will i do now? Only time will tell... Drop by a comment, if u browse. Many thanks.

      I went out anyway, didn't have too much of a blast. The purpose of the excursion was to ensure that she got home safely. I know i know.. i am being a fool, but i can't help it. I really like her. There's this other chiq who is also coming on to me, but she's just not my type. I am also at a loss on how to tell her i am not interested. Sigh!.... The world is so unfair. I am not bastardious enough to just go after her even though i am not interested.. Ohh shit... Listening to Boyzone : No matter what...  Can relate to the song, it hurts...  like hell..  Might just have to contemplate moving on.

      I finally joined the gym last week, paid RM362, and Rm140 monthly for the next 12 months. Good good. Right, so i was like driving back from Great Eastern Mall where i met with a auto accident. It wasn't anything serious. I mean like.. after the first big bang in 98, this is  nothing to worry about. I drive a proton wira, malaysia's national car, i have my gripes with it, it gets me from point A to B. Fine.. But it's so fucking fragile. One bump and everything goes loose. Proton cost cuts and butt fucks the malaysian public, by producing inferior quality cars. The Government overprices non national makes through a rigid tax structure, making Japanese, Korean and european makes out of reach from the average joe like me. Anyway, damages = bonnet kemek, bumper kemek, chassis kemek a bit, front grill gone.. Total cost i have to spend on repair bills = RM800.  Lemme enlighten u on how this went down. It was at a T-junction. Some asshole, sped thru a red light, forcing the car in front of me to do an emergency brake, forcing me to do an emergency brake as well, but i couldn't brake on time, so i rear ended the kelisa in front of me. Damage on the kelisa was quite minimum, i would say cost of repairs RM400 plus.. The dude who sped the red light stopped, then after some negotiations, left. ( i will decline to elaborate) But the kelisa dude also left cos he was flabbergasted. So, i was gonna lodge a report, which must be within 24 hours. If the kelisa dude doesn't lodge, i won't too, and fix the car by myself.  So, next story, i am now contemplating as to whether to go out for my usual saturday nite out, or not. What i have is 3 concerns.  no. 1 = Cost.. i am like gonna be spending RM800 soon. no. 2 = I will have to use my mom's car, which i am reluctant to do so. no. 3 = I don't feel like drinking today. I love liquor, but not today.  With that being said, if any lovely ladies (colleagues) do ask me to go, i might hessitate for a bit, then probably will go. Another thing is parking. I am thoroughly familliar with my car, the dimensions and all, but not so much with my mom's car, hence the hessitancy. We'll see how it goes la.  So, how you might ask is it going with my conquest? Well, she still views me as too young, i suppose. If i take her view point, that would be true. So, like i said, i need to grow up as fast as possible. Procastinator should be my name! hehehe I truly need to be kicked to do work or at least get started.  Hmm... enuff for today.

      Today at work, i drew a pie chart to try to understand my feelings. They consisted of aspiration, realisation, disappointment, spanner and one more negative feeling i which i forgot. Right, my day was actually interesting per se'. This morning i went to meet a client, where bumbling moi messed up big time. Forgot to take signatures and shit.FUCK! The other thing, i got my senior in trouble by messing up an appointment. I fucked up big time again. Then came the 2nd appointment with another HNWI. That went well, i guess. Maybe i am overreacting. But, i will clean up my mess soon enough. You start it, you end it! Enuff said. I helped Tee buy a Pc over the weekend, and the fucking computer technician twat forgot to install the dvdrom. I was like wat the fuck!! Then, i called up the shop, and Tee without my knowledge went to have it fixed. Fine. Then i am now thinking. I need to sober up big time now! I need to discipline myself big time, I need to SOBER UP! It's like i have been drinking for so long now. Think faster, move faster, Lie better! FUck... I need to learn to Cover my Ass well enough. NUFF said. I will pray later before i sleep for strength, for discipline.  Oh yeah, wot's new about the chick i am into. Everytime i get into deep shit, i feel damn guilty and i know now, that i will have to grow up and grow up FAST. Today, i initially thought i saw a foreseeable path, but it was now shattered. FUCK.. It's all sales at what the fuck level it is. I have come to a conclusion, that i fucking hate consulting. I dunno man....  shit...  I really need to release some stress soon, dudes... Gonna join the gym tomorrow. We'll see how it goes.. Gonna work hard and smart tomorrow. I SWEAR!
