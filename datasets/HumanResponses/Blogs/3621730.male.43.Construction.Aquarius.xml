      Yes, at this late hour I sift around the net for things that interest me about Delaware County. Just do a Google search on "Gil Spencer Delaware County" and you"ll get some interesting results.   F. Gilman Spencer   Polk Career Award Winner  F. Gilman Spencer has done much more than preside as editor over major newspapers around the country — he also inspired and encouraged a generation of journalists and raised tabloid journalism to new heights. In his wake, he left a trail of top journalism honors won by the newspapers he edited, having won his own Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing while editor of The Trentonian in 1974. He went on to become editor of the Philadelphia Daily News, from 1975 to 1984, and editor of the New York Daily News, from 1984 to 1989. He served as editor of The Denver Post, from 1989 to 1993 and received a Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Colorado in 1994. This brief history, however, hardly begins to describe the journalist who helped ignite the careers of many reporters, columnists and editorialists and energized news coverage in the cities his newspapers served. Some comments, excerpted from letters by those who worked with him over the years, shed more light on his accomplishments.  "Spencer is a writer’s editor, also an editor’s editor. Much of his career was spent on tabloids, and he was a genius at jumping on local news stories, covering the local sports teams, reaching out to the reader with grab-ya headlines, provocative editorials and terse chiseled prose. But unlike some tabloid editors, he never tried to pass off rumor as fact, and he liked substance and specialized in making it readable. Here’s an example: an obscure University of Pennsylvania scientist won the Nobel Prize. And the [Philadelphia] Daily News served it up to its readers in sports-crazy Philadelphia under this headline: ‘Phillies Fan Wins Nobel.’"  Gene Roberts, former managing editor of The New York Times, former executive editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer and now professor of journalism at the University of Maryland.  "The Philadelphia Daily News, where I followed him as Editor, exists today because of Gil. He battled the ownership when it imagined a Joint Operating Agreement that would have driven the News out of business. More importantly, he created a formula — blending serious journalism with provocative opinion and pure fun — that kept readers and talented young journalists coming to the newspaper. All these years later, when the Philadelphia Daily News does something right, I attribute it to Gil."  Zachary Stalberg, Editor, Philadelphia Daily News  "Gil was the mythic kind of editor who stands behind his people and also prods them to go into the difficult places that enlighten the readers while inevitably creating headaches for management. Gil never dodged the headaches: he also made sure the staff never noticed when he got them."  Gail Collins, Editorial Page Editor, The New York Times  "In the mid-1980s, Gil led the New York Daily News to something of a golden era. He took over a demoralized paper that had been starved for resources by a distant corporate owner, restored its confidence and built it into the city’s dominant voice. Among the hallmarks were aggressive local coverage, unflinching editorials and an unparalleled stable of columnists.  "A tumultuous and high-energy city room became a Petri dish for talent. The alumni and alumnae include Marilyn Thompson, the Washington Post’s Pulitzer prize-wining projects’ editor; Gail Collins, The New York Times editorial page editor; columnists and commentators Jimmy Breslin and Jack Newfield; and Debbie Krenek, who rose to become editor of the News and now serves as Newsday’s presentation and multi-media editor."  Arthur Brown, Editorial Page Editor, New York Daily News  "I would walk through fire for Gil Spencer. Hell, I would even cover a zoning board hearing for Gil Spencer. Gil is the kind of editor who inspires reporters and editors, who gets more out of a staff by turning them loose to do their best work."  Richard Aregood, Editorial Page Editor, The Star Ledger  "If you were romanced by newspapering, then you were drawn to Gil Spencer, for his cocky self-assuredness, his style, his perfect wit…. Spencer was one of the titans of his era and, absolutely, the best tabloid editor of the last 50 years…. He was an editor of great consequence in two of the nation’s most important cities. The newspapers he ran performed with great distinction. And he did all of that in an enchanting manner. Gil Spencer is the stuff of greatnesss and worthy of the Lifetime Achievement Award.  So what's the "F" stand for?

      Re-posted from The Haverford Blog   Vito Corleone Guest    Idiot Unsafe Drivers Â« on: Jun 2, 2004, 8:39pm Â»       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I didn't know what thread this would fit into, so I decided on the "Hall of Shame"    It concerns me that I see numerous situations of very dangerous driving within the township. People blowing stop signs with blatant disregard (even w/kids present on the street) speeding all over the place (I've seen vehicles as of late on Darby Rd before the Skatium reaching 50 mph in a 35 zone) drivers ignoring one way streets (as my street is w/kids present)     I know that our police dept is quite busy writing up drivers quite frequently but there is a real need for more aggressive enforcement.    At the rate of being flamed (I really don't care though, this is the truth) I see quita lotot of "Housewives" driving around in over sized SUV's and family vans who are on cell phones gabbing away and are completely distracted from what's going on with the road in front of them (some even have 3 or 4 kids in the car and a dog while still gabbing on the phone!) yet they gab away on the cell phone and are not fully aware of what they are doing behind the wheel.    How about this, anyone else care to get in on the horrible drivers in and around Haverford Twp? There are plenty of them, all accidents waiting to happen.     I can relate to the Soccer Moms barreling down the road gabbing on their "cell phones". As an electrician based in Havertown, (Bellemead AveToto be exact)I get so pig biting mad at these women. Furthermore, just try to pull into the WAWA at Darby & Manoa Rds. They cut in front of you, are rude, and best of all they think their hot shit and that they have a bigger vehicle than you attitude. Basically what I'm saying is Women driving SUV's should be BANNED from the road. Give em' a Ford Taurus or something!    In Defence of the ladies, I came across this:   Today, in two or three minutes of your reading time, we will cover the resentment and rage of soccer-mom drivers; the resentment between stay-at-home moms and moms who work outside the home; the resentment of divorced moms; the resentment of small-car drivers against SUV drivers; and we will consider the advice of one woman reader, who told me to get the book, "The Bitch in the House," and get a clue.    This all started last week when I wrote about a driving experience that is more and more common: Meeting up with a soccer mom, or maybe it's a baseball or basketball mom, who's driving that minivan or 2 and a half ton SUV.   I told about having one such mom honk her horn at me at a four-way intersection stop because I hadn't moved fast enough. When the road changed from one to two lanes, she gunned it and screeched past me. A few blocks later I saw the very important destination. She was going shopping at a supermarket.   What's the deal? Is a one-second delay such a big thing? The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says that between 1975 and 1998, the number of women in fatal crashes increased by 60 percent. It's true that the number of women drivers went up, but a 60 percent increase in fatal crashes? And this while the number of men in fatal crashes dropped 11 percent.   Here is Laurie Wick, a Bellevue mom whose soccer-driving days are over now that her daughter is in college. Want some reasons why that soccer mom is honking her horn?   "While I don't condone self-indulgent, immature, angry behavior, I believe these women are stressed to the max. A typical day is non-stop rush-rush-rush until they collapse into bed totally exhausted," Laurie told me. "Why aren't the dads doing more of the schlepping kids to their various after-school and evening classes and sports? Or picking up more of the load of running a household, like constant housecleaning, laundry, shopping, cooking?"   Which brings us to that book, "The Bitch in the House: 26 Women Tell the Truth About Sex, Solitude, Work, Motherhood, and Marriage," (William Morrow & Co., 2002).   Editor Cathi Hanauer put it together after late-night Internet chats with other women who'd tell her things like, "I'm fine all day at work, but as soon as I get home, I'm a horror." I'm sure you guys will be rushing to order that book on Amazon.com., because guys love reading about how women really feel.   A divorced mom e-mailed this: "Next time you write about soccer moms and road rage, write about their kids being orphans ... victims of divorce ... "   Here is Ann Smith of Graham, another former soccer mom, divorced, who has an extended family at home. She remembers what it was like "trying to survive on my meager salary, always one step ahead of the bill collectors."   Aggressive driver? Ann said that's her. Now she's helping raise her grandkids. "With football practice, missed buses, picking up and dropping off friends, and grocery stops, I find myself always in a hurry. So when I get behind some guy in his pick-up truck, going the speed limit, with nowhere to go except to work, I find myself passing him at the first opportunity!" she said. "The most irritating are guys in the morning, driving like they have all day to get there."   You know, I've met Ann, and she's a very nice, seemingly calm woman. I also happen to own an old pick-up, and I do drive the speed limit, so I'm planning to get to know Ann's driving schedule and stay out of her way.   Let's continue with our resentment list.   Here's a Mill Creek woman reader with her explanation about the soccer mom's hectic schedule, and the ensuing road rage:   "I also believe that Society's Working Moms put pressure on the Stay At Home Mom to prove that she's actually 'doing something' during the day and not just sitting around watching soap operas and eating bonbons.   "Thumb your noses at these Working Moms! They're just jealous that they've chosen not to do the same because they want more expensive clothes and a 'better' lifestyle. Don't burden us with your guilt!"   Oh, the resentment, the resentment.   "You really don't get it, do you?" a mom/software developer asked me. It's all about power trips, she said, and by printing comments from SUV owners, "you, my friend, help fuel it by providing these arrogant snobs with an arena in which to show off."   She had a few more things on her mind about SUV women drivers: "Nevermind that these moms are busy, even though most of them are elite members of that perfect 'stay-at-home' group. We who drive modest cars and actually have a job AND kids (so I guess I have two full-time jobs, uh?) are a whole lot busier, but we somehow manage to go about our busy day without mowing down everyone else on the road."   I started thinking that maybe I should start taking the bus everywhere. Then I heard from a bus driver. He told me about merging onto the freeway when a woman in her SUV accelerated so the bus wouldn't get in front of her.   "This woman went totally out of control by swerving from lane to lane, flipping me off, and this from a woman who appeared in her 30s," the driver said.   So, that's today's traffic report, which concludes with this question for you drivers, men and women:   What's wrong with a little peace, love and understanding? On the highways, plenty, I guess.      And it's only Monday!

      So, Still collecting money for an election that has been a few months old? You lost so take down the donation page...     Federal election law requires political committees to use best efforts to report the name, mailing address, occupation, and name of employer of individuals whose contributions exceed $200 in a calendar year. An individual may not contribute more than a total of $2000 per election to the committee. Federal law prohibits contributions to the committee from the general treasury funds of a corporation, labor organizations or national banks (including corporate or other business entity credit cards), from any person contributing another's funds, from a Federal government contractor, or from a foreign national who lacks permanent resident status. Contributions are not deductible for Federal income tax purposes.

      Last week (Sunday 06/14/2004)I bought an AFX SEMI on ebay. I paid via paypal and waited for it. After 2 days I e mailed the seller (supes1) about shipping it. No reply. E mailed 4 more times, no answer. Then I receive an e mail about a plate and feedback, (Or so in my delusional state of mind I think I did)Now realize that it was a  sent  e mail, one that I posted months ago.  So I reply with my yahoo e mail account in a nasty way.  See Below.  First of all, I am, not "Lisa". Second of all, I never received my item "The AFX Semi" that I fucking paid you for 7 days ago. Now, lemme tell you something about me. I have a popular web site that deals with dead beat rip offs.. Want to join the list?   Either respond to this e mail and ship me what I paid for or I'll make your name EBAY Id mud. Piss me off enough, and I'll visit you in person.  P.S.   Where the fuck is MY positive feedback? i paid your sorry ass 16 minutes after the auction ended....  Your a CON artist.  YOU have 24 hours to make good or your feedback will point to my web site with a lengthy slamming of you with the ability of others joining in.  YOU SAID....  Lisa, Could you provide some positive feedback for me? I hope the plate was what you expected.  Happy Holidays :-) Fran Ward ebay id: antiques_and_other_stuff  Ok. now me thinking that I just e mailed the seller who in my mind ripped me off a good nasty letter, I receive this e mail:  TO WHOM THIS MAY CONCERN,   I AM PATROLMAN RICK SCHIAZZA FROM THE CITY OF LEWES POLICE DEPT. LEWES  DE. 19958. I AM WRITING THIS LETTER REGARDING YOUR E-MAIL TO  xxxxxxxxxxxxx@aol.com. APPARENTLY YOU SENT E-MAIL TO THAT ADDRESS THAT  WAS INTIMIDATING IN NATURE. ACCORDING TO xxxxxxxxxxxx NOTHING WAS SOLD TO  YOU. I NEED YOU TO CONTACT THE CITY OF LEWES POLICE DEPT. AT  302-645-6264 OR 302-645-6154. HOPEFULLY THIS SITUATION WAS A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING  AND THIS CAN BE CLEARED UP IMMEDIATELY. I MUST CAUTION YOU THAT  xxxxxxxxxxxx DOES NOT WANT TO BE CONTACTED BY YOU ANYMORE. PLEASE ALSO BE AWARE  THAT ANY FUTURE CONTACTS MADE BY YOU CAN BE AT THIS POINT BE CONSIDERED  HARRASSMENT BY COMMUNICATION. ONCE AGAIN I BELIEVE THAT YOUR THIS  SITUATION WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING AND NEED YOU TO CONTACT ME ASAP. IN ORDER  TO VERIFY THE POLICE TELEPHONE NO YOU CAN GET ONTO THE  www.yellowpages.msn.com AND AUTHENTICATE THE POLICE DEPT TELEPHONE NO. I HAVE TYPED IN  ABOVE.   THANK YOU.    Sent via the KillerWebMail system at lewespd.state.de.us  Now, wondering if I really screwed up or this is also a con I checked out the mail headers and it seemed to come from the Lewes Police Dept. (BTW, I love the ferry.) So, being that I have egg on my face and do not have long distance calling and also seemed to be a little intimaded  myself by the letter I sent this:   Patrolman Schiazza, This was a misunderstanding. I'll explain. I bought an AFX SEMI through ebay over a week ago. Paid in Full through paypal. I repetedly e mailed the seller to ship me the item and NEVER got a reply. Then I receive this email out of the blue about a plate. I belived that xxxxxxxxxxxxx@aol.com was the one who ripped me off. I was wrong. Tell her that I am sorry for the confusion.  Apparently I had either sold her or she bought something off of me on ebay.com and I got her e mail address confused with the con artist. I am not in the business being mean to people, I hope she understands that.   Fran Ward  Well I sent it and Yahoo replied with an "Undeliverable" reply. So now what? Will the jackboots come crashing through my door and arrest me on being stupid? Do I call this guy from work? Ignore him? The person I sent the e mail to by misteak bought a royal copenhagen plate off of me called "The Stag". back in December of 03.   Comments about this are more than welcome..

      I here one is coming on June 27th.    Will an asteroid hit the Earth?  Answer:  A number of recent movies have been about this subject. It is important to remember that they are just movies and often times do not represent good or true science. Sometimes, however, there is a tiny seed of truth behind a movie, although it may be hard to tell what is true and what is fiction. This is the case for the movies about asteroids hitting the Earth.  Let us say right away that at this moment, we know of nothing currently on a collision course with Earth. Last year, it was announced in the news that an asteroid was on a collision course with Earth and would hit in the year 2028. We now know that the calculations were in error and that asteroid will miss the Earth completely. You can read more about this at http://impact.arc.nasa.gov/news/1998/jun/12.html.  Keep in mind that the Earth has been hit before by asteroids and will be again someday. We don't know when, but we do know it is not in the immediate future.   Why are the chances of us being hit small? Our solar system is very big compared to the size of the Earth, which means that the chance that the Earth will be hit by another solar system object such as an asteroid is very small. Once in awhile, it happens. But not very often.  Think about this, most of the asteroids in our solar system are located in the asteroid belt. Yet we have been able to send spacecraft such as Voyager I and II, as well as others, through this belt without any problems. Why? There is more "empty space" in the belt than asteroids!   How often do we expect the Earth to be hit? The asteroids capable of causing a global disaster if they hit the Earth are extremely rare. They probably would need to be about a kilometer or more in diameter. Such bodies impact the Earth only once every 100,000 years on average. Other objects of a similar size, such as comets, impact even less frequently, perhaps once every 500,000 years or so.   If we discover an object that will collide with Earth's, what could be done about it? If astronomers find such an object, there would be plenty of time to track it, measure its orbit precisely, and plan a system for deflecting it from its current orbital path. There would be no great hurry and no great panic. It would be a project for all the world's nations to take part in. Because we will have found it long before it actually intersects the Earth's orbit, it probably would take only a small push (perhaps from chemical rockets we land on the surface of the asteroid) to divert it from a threatening path.   Who is watching the skies? There are agencies, NASA among them, which realize that although the Earth is in no immediate danger, an asteroid impact is something that will pose a problem sometime in the future. It is in the world's best interest not to ignore this, but to be watchful in ....

      The Bush Landslide of 2004 By Charles Cutter May 6, 2004, 20:38   Email this article  Printer friendly page   By connecting the dots, we can see into the future that’s envisioned by George W. Bush’s corporate sponsors. Control the media; control the vote; control the military. Conspiracy theory? Not really; a good portion of it is being done right out in the open. It’s being done with a double-edged arrogance, with the conviction that most people are so disinterested or propagandized they won’t care anyway - call it a "coup d’etat of the willing" - and that those who do care are helpless to prevent it.  Control the media: The FCC is working to consolidate the power and reach of media conglomerates. As this issue unfolds, we witness the eagerness of these conglomerates in striking down voices of dissent. Clear Channel Communications fires Howard Stern (following the FCC’s partisan demonstration of selective enforcement). The Disney Company refuses to distribute Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit 911, a documentary film critical of Bush & Co. Sinclair Broadcasting Group forbids its ABC affiliates to air a Nightline episode honoring America’s fallen soldiers in Iraq. Executives at Sinclair - Bush supporters, of course - refer to the episode as a "so-called tribute…designed to undermine the efforts of the United States in Iraq." Senator John McCain calls Sinclair’s actions "…unpatriotic…a gross disservice to the public, and to…the United States Armed Forces."  It’s not necessary that a media conglomerate hew to a right-wing agenda. For effective control, it’s only necessary that a company’s vested interests be threatened. In the case of Disney, for instance, Moore’s film is small potatoes compared to the risk of losing tax breaks for their other ventures in Jeb Bush’s Florida. This is the problem with large companies - there’s always a branch somewhere that can be threatened. Governor Bush (and Disney) deny this is a factor, but they can’t deny that extortion works best when it’s unspoken. Nor can they deny what Richard Clarke, Valerie Plame, Paul O’Neill and many others know so well - that those expressing criticism of this administration can expect retribution.  Control the vote: Why rely on the Supreme Court to prevent a ballot recount, when right-wing corporations can do it much more efficiently? Walden O’Dell, chairman of the board of Diebold Election Systems - one of the largest suppliers of touch-screen voting machines in the country - is a huge Bush supporter. He claims he is "committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to [George W. Bush] in 2004." Certainly he’s just offering donations and activism, right?  Let’s forget that, in 2002, Senate Democrat Max Cleland went from a 49-44 lead in the polls to a 53-46 loss a week later. Diebold fraud? We’ll never know. "Computer experts say that software at Diebold and other manufacturers is full of security flaws, which would easily allow an insider to rig the election…And here’s the crucial point: even if there are strong reasons to suspect that electronic machines miscounted votes, nothing can be done about it. There is no paper trail; there is nothing to recount." (Paul Krugman, "Democracy at Risk," New York Times, 1/23/04)  Control the military: The second largest military force serving in Iraq (after the United States) consists of corporate soldiers. Many of these mercenaries - provided by Titan, Blackwater, etc. - reportedly make in excess of $100,000 per year (compare that with salaries paid to U.S. soldiers). Bush’s war for "freedom" is - to a large degree - being staffed by soldiers of fortune; hired killers.  We’ve moving well beyond the "military-industrial complex" that President Eisenhower warned about. The future now holds an added threat - not only will the armored tank be the product of private industry, but the soldiers inside it will be working for a private corporation as well (with the companies themselves funded by - and this is the kicker - American taxpayers). In which direction does a corporate soldier point his gun, when conflicted between defending the Constitution and defending a mission statement?  This unfolding future - it’s called a "capitalist theocracy," where the object of worship is money - will not be stopped simply by replacing George W. Bush. It is, however, an essential first step, which forces us to confront two difficult questions.  First, is there any way to persuade a solid majority of the American public of the true damage this administration has wrought on this country, and on the world? Putting some faith in polling results, there is evidence of erosion in support for Mr. Bush’s policies; but this erosion has not translated into support for his opponent, Senator Kerry. At the moment, we’re looking at a dead-even presidential race. So this first question is still undecided.  But the second question is by far the more disturbing: If so inclined, could an activist electorate successfully vote Mr. Bush out of office? In other words - to face our worst fears - has the presidential election of 2004 already been "fixed?" Certainly Mr. Bush’s supporters have both the means and the motive to steal another election. How can we - with less than six months remaining - guarantee a legitimate outcome? Suppose that pre-election polling shows an imminent Kerry victory, but touch-screen results deliver the election to Bush. How do you prove (or disprove) charges of fraud and corruption? As we’ve seen, these issues are difficult enough to resolve under normal circumstances. But without a paper trail, it’s like trying to match a pistol to a crime scene - when the bullet used was made of ice.

      What a shame...    Haverford Taxpayer Alliance at vanguard of protest     LOIS PUGLIONESI , Times Correspondent  06/16/2004      MEDIA COURTHOUSE -- Although a number of local political groups joined the fray, the Haverford Taxpayer Alliance was the catalyst in organizing Tuesday’s rally of about 15 protesters at the county courthouse.   A mix of Republicans, Democrats and independents, the taxpayer alliance claims it’s leading a campaign for honesty, accountability and reform in local government and the judiciary, as well as an end to wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars.     The group was born out of protest to a covert $600,000 payment made to Haverford real-estate consultant Jeffrey Rotwitt last December. Members have also expressed criticism of current plans for developing the Haverford State Hospital site, and the majority commissioners’ controversial reapportionment plan, currently before the Board of Elections.     Launched by a core membership of 10 to 12 community activists, the alliance has grown rapidly, using an extensive email list and the Haverford Blog.    Tom Broido, a founding member, said he believes "people who accept the public trust should behave in the best interest of the public who elected them and not treat it like a feeding trough."    Broido thinks jobs, favors, contracts and even district justice jobs are going "to people who are connected" while "a lot of the connections can usually be traced back to Clouse ..I’ve lived in the township 24 years and I’ve had it. This isn’t going to go on in Haverford anymore."     Before he became a judge, Clouse was a Republican commissioner in the township and led a group of rebels who were often at war with party leaders.     While Broido was dismayed by the allegations leveled at Clouse, he said he is more troubled by the judge’s silence. "In refusing to answer questions ..Clouse is putting himself above the law, beyond reproach and the need for explanations. To me that is unforgivable because of the position he’s in," Broido said.     "Something’s got to be done. The president judge should be held to higher standards, said Jeff Heilmann, a Republican committeeman and taxpayers alliance founder, displaying a sign that read, "We won’t relax until Clouse pays the tax."    Republican committeewoman and alliance member Pat Biswanger pointed to "the waste of tax dollars ..caused largely by a group of people who have taken hold of our government and think there’s one set of rules for them, and one set of rules for the rest of us ..When we see what appears to be a judge ..who doesn’t think he should have to pay the same taxes we all do ..we figured it was time to take action."    ©The Daily Times 2004

      Date: Sun, 13 June 2004 05:00:53 -0700  From: "Coopertowner"  To: frannyward@yahoo.com  Subject: [I live in Delaware County] 6/13/2004 08:00:52 AM          I would like to see other communities start their own blogs. It's fast and cheap. I won't say it's easy because I am not one of the Blog Team and I know they work very hard, but I think they'd agree it's worth it! With so little meaningful press coverage, and with the cost of direct mail so prohibitive and people so unlikely to read it anyway, blogging is a good, cheap, reliable way to spread the word about what's going on in your local government, and to hold accountable those who need to be held accountable.   Don't let them tell you it's wrong to post things anonymously! The people who are out there spending our money wrongly hate this, and that's their first attack, that we are wrong for blogging anonymously. But remember the Boston Tea Party, caused by excessive taxation, and the anonymous pamphleteering of the Revolutionary period. It's part of the great American tradition of free speech and our exercise of our First Amendment rights, and more people should do it, not fewer!   As Justice Stevens wrote in an anonymous political speech case just a few years ago, "under our Constitution, anonymous pamphleteering is not a pernicious, fraudulent practice, but an honorable tradition of advocacy and of dissent. Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority."   Posted by Coopertowner to I live in Delaware County at 6/13/2004 08:00:52 AM    I also agree with Cooper. The government at all levels should be held accountable and answer to their constituents...

      I have acute bronchitis and pneumonia. Last winter I had the same thing and cracked a rib coughing. Still smoking these damn cigarettes though. It amazes me that people like me can be so addicted to something even knowing that the product is killing them. The last time I quit smoking was in 1981, and only for 2 years. But I did it cold turkey, with no support other than Gods. So, when you factor in that a&nbsp; pack and ½ a day for twenty one years at an average of&nbsp; 3.00 a pack at 365 days plus those weekend binges and buying the girl friend’s and &nbsp;wife them adds up to about $12,500.00. And I’m not even including all the Budweiser in all those same years either.   I try to quit, and then within a few hours go nuts. Literally. Nicotine to me is probably like heroine to a junkie. I have tried the patch, gum, and cold turkey and nothing helps. It doesn’t help that the wife smokes either. So, I pose the question to ex smokers. How did you do it? Were you just sick and tired of being sick and tired? Did the doc warn you that you were heading for trouble? At this very moment, I am puffing and hacking away.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really need to&nbsp;contact    urlLink  these people.    &nbsp;  A WAWA coffee in the morning to me just won’t cut it if my Winston’s aren’t included.  All that money. Speaking of money, what ever happened to the billions of dollars the states (including ours) received? Did I, the nicotine junkie see any? Just who received that cash?   Well, it’s time to head out to WAWA. Have a smoke free day.

Aspartame complaints accounts for approximately 70% of ALL complaints to the FDA. It is implicated in everything from blindness to headaches to convulsions. Sold under dozens of brand names such as NutraSweet and Equal, aspartame breaks down within 20 minutes at room temperature into several primary toxic and dangerous ingredients:  1. DKP (diketopiperazine) (When ingested, converts to a near duplicate of  a powerful brain tumor causing agent)  2. Formic Acid (ant venom)  3. Formaldehyde (embalming fluid)  4. Methanol (causes blindness...extremely dangerous substance)  Common Examples:  Diet soft drinks, sugar free gums, sugar free Kool Aid, Crystal Light, children's medications, and thousands of other products claiming to be 'low calorie', 'diet', or 'sugar free'.

       The Mind Altering Abilities of Chemtrails   by Anonymous  http://educate-yourself.org/ct/ctsmindalteringability29jun04.shtmlPosted June 29, 2004Original Posting Sept. 15, 2000   Original title: The Great Dying; The Real Reason Behind ChemtrailsWatching the debates over (and phone taps to my line here) since sending you my email of yesterday, it occurred to me that I should get this last email out to you regarding and expanding upon the reasons for CTs, as well as dealing with issues sure to be discounted by the agents of the ONI (Office of Naval Intelligence, the agency in charge of the Chemtrails Ops.)  Taking each issue in turn might help shed some light upon this problem. The overall scope and agenda behind Chemtrails (Operation Clover Leaf, Operation Red Sky, Operation Rain Dance, the code names for these ops, BTW) intertwines several overall objectives deemed imperative by the real power in DC, which is the NSA [Natioanl Security Adminsitration]. It should be noted that most of the intel groups that are involved in domestic control are, in varying degrees, "in the loop" on this business and are actively working with the ONI and NSA in seeing this program succeed. Listing all the agencies would be moot and pointless. What would anyone do with the knowledge anyway? The reason I say this has to due with STO vs. STS [Service to Others vs. Service to Self spiritual orientation]. Here's what we mean: By conservative estimates, there are over 300,000 people in the USA alone that are chemtrails aware. Of those, only about 125 people have undertaken an active campaign to educate and inform the masses about this "final solution." Do the math. How many of you know what the word apathy means? The agencies are counting upon this apathy and in fact, helped create that state of consciousness to begin with way back in the late 1950 (Fluoridation, Aspartame, street narcotics.) If such a small percentage were actually doing anything about the phenomena, then wouldn't these same agencies be correct in their analysis that "they don't have anything to worry about?" The facts speak for themselves. They will in fact succeed, because they are at the 80% completion point in these CT operations. They will be finished by March of 2001. Main and ancillary operational objectives of Chemtrails as outlined in Operation Red Sky, Phase One: Main objective: Creative cleavages in spatial perceptions. Creating a blockage in the brain of the interaction of various amino acids that relate to higher consciousness and the increase of dopamine in the brain producing a listless, euphoric state of lower, reactive mind. This, though most cannot (won't?) process this perception, is their main objective. It has many layers to it, and the salts found in these CTS are the prime indicators of just why they use such a vector to create this state in the human brain, the physical repository of and connecting point between the real and the unreal. To understand this goal necessitates an understanding of the human soul, the Self (Christ or God within, if you like) and the connection between the two as related to the endocrine system functioning within each human host. Pay close attention to these last words, as "host" indicates that there is a parasitic relationship to be established. Many UFO abductions are part of this op. To begin with, we must understand that our intelligence agencies are operating at a very high level of OCCULT SKILL AND AWARENESS, as taught to them by their progenitors, the Nazis of old who were brought here in 1947 through 1953 via various operations, the most common known being Operation Paper-Clip. In short, any Intel agent of a G20 rating is a practicing black magician entirely "sold out," soul-wise, (via rites, satanic rituals, and esoteric training in Long Island, Florida, and California) and are, speaking plainly, functioning black Adepts with a complete and unquestioned license to kill. These are the top-level agency personnel. Make no mistake. These are the very same men and women who run the Mind Control Ops (CIA), the abduction of children (FBI) on a staggering global level, are involved in and are the contactees between the Ets (USAF, ONI, NSA, etc) and our government, ad nauseam. In short, to understand Chemtrails we must understand the personnel who have the power to do what they want, whenever they want, and we must also understand their needs. They need the following: 1. The overall "frequency" of each of their charges (human beings in each country) to function at a specific rate below the threshold of awareness. The study of brain-wave, Remote Viewing techniques, and other related research holds the key to this. As we know, a physical brain functioning at 12 to 14 cycles per second is agitated and cannot, therefore, become perceptive of any cycle not within the same frequency, especially if that brain is ARTIFICIALLY STABILIZED to that frequency. How can one perceive love, when the brain can only register impatience, anger, etc? (Remember, their goal has to do with our souls in dimensions humanity has never, ever, considered.) It is because of the occult nature of our covert agencies (and the real powers running them) that most cannot even begin to research in the right direction to begin with. 2. The immune system of the host must be depleted. This relates to control, simply put. If the slightest breeze makes you dizzy, what kind of defense can you be expected to put up if you can't lift your arms above your head without getting a headache? The many outnumber the few. This is the main reason for much of the desiccated red blood cells found in chemtrails: biowarfare. This also allows the parasite to latch onto the human host with little resistance from the organism so attached. 3. They need agreement. This last statement is by far the MOST CRUCIAL STAGE of all. It isn't enough to make us slaves, we MUST WANT TO BECOME SLAVES. Food scarcity, low wages, false idealism as propagated via network commercials, all create a state of low-level dependency to a state system, but it is not enough. To win (want to know what winning is to the CIA?) these ruling covert agencies need our permission to do what they will to us (Universal Law, no getting around that one and they've known this since 1847.) The system of this biosphere has one final gate that only each of us can open or close and it is, in fact, free will. Free will. Such a concept. That alone would take another ten pages, but there's no time. Once we understand their needs, their objectives become easily understandable and quite discernable. The real questions never-NEVER-asked in any chemtrails discussions is A) What do they want? B) How must they achieve it? Ancillary objective: create and maintain a lowered immune system, for use by phase three, which is the execution of their binary weapons systems, to be triggered by microwaves. Know what a  urlLink GWEN tower  is? Better find out and soon, as you can see them everywhere from your homes and offices. Ever wonder why we have so very many cell phones practically given away for free right now? Know what a burst transmitter is? Does anyone have even the remotest idea of what a low-watt microwave transmission does to the cerebellum when the human brain is within three feet of such a device? If you lack this knowledge, then it is to your detriment. The information is out there. Get hip. The great side benefit that even the NSA didn't predict (their estimate was a little over 3%) is the 12% reduction in population chemtrails are giving our "masters." That's right - 12%. In the distant future, the 1990s and beyond will become known as "the great dying." In August of 2000, the sky over Los Angeles was actually blood red for two days. (They over-sprayed, due to fucked up orders at Edwards AFB.) The morgues were packed solid for a week and over-flowing. There are still hundreds of thousands reeling from that two-day period. Many hospitals and clinics ran out of antibiotics overnight. Binary weapons need to be triggered and they will use FM, AM, and Microwave GWEN towers to do it. It's all setup, op completed in 1998. Why do this? Wake up! Can't control 6+ billion people - too many. Got to thin them out to keep them in line. I can see the squeemers now as they read this. How and when will they go to Stage Two on this op? Can you say  urlLink fake alien invasion , with millions dying and getting sick overnight? The test for this will be a planned (already complete staged op, in fact, West Nile Virus [WNV]) biowarfare incident on a major US or European or Australia (the latter most likely, as they are already completely disarmed down under.) This will give them the final test data they need to go to Stage Two, which is the alien invasion occasionally hinted at once and a while on the Internet. Now I must be crazy, right? At least, when I die, I will know who and why. That's more than I can say for most. Tough love. It seems the only way to reach you people. Culling of the Biosphere: Many folks will rightly say that "the culling of the elderly, et al" is flat-out nonsense  urlLink because Chemtrails affect the sprayers as well as the civilian population . That assertion is essentially correct, but the following should be noted: 1. A virus can only affect you if you are not immunized from it. Think these folks are up to date with their "private cache" of vaccines? Sure. You don't send out a binary weapon until you are damn certain it won't kill you, the killer. This reaction of "the sprayers breathe it in, too!" is grasping at straws that don't even exist in any reality. Simply put: it is denial. 2. They simply don't care who they kill, even their own pawns and puppets in the military -- "fuck 'em." That's the CIA way. Get used to it. Too hard for you? Don't like the words? They use them a hundred times a day, just ask anyone who has ever been debriefed by these agencies; they have the foulest mouths on the planet. Red Grid/Blue Grid In the end, the how, the who, the when of chemtrails is just so much smoke and mirrors. Just because you've identified the UH1H helicopter, the KC-135 tanker, and the use of Boeing 737s in Chemtrails is really, again in the end, meaningless. We all know who were the shooters in Dallas, but so what? That knowledge doesn't change anything. Find out who is giving the orders and why and then you've got something. To Be Continued if possible NAME WITHHELD BY REQUEST --------- Michael of World-Action, November 2002: My main intention of posting this is to remind us of the abilities of chemtrails to confuse us about what is real and what is not real. According to the above, their aim was to come to a level of completion of chemtrail spraying by MARCH 2000 - this was right at the beginning of the reign of the NWO's new main puppet: George Bush Junior - essentially George Bush Senior and his shadowy oil, power &amp; world domination people. Very soon after March 2001, the world's credulity was started to be stretched to the limit, with strange and insane policies by the Bush Administration. Then came the thumping great lie and world rape and traumatisation of '9-11'..... and Chemtrails had been sprayed intensively over the previous two to three years, circulating to every breathing entity on Earth due to global wind currents.

      Jul 23, 1:32 AM EDT  9/11 Panel Urges Intelligence Overhaul  By TERENCE HUNTAP White House Correspondent   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's leaders failed to grasp the gravity of terrorist threats before the devastating attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, taking actions so feeble they never even slowed the al-Qaida plotters, a national commission said in a blistering report Thursday.   The panel warned "we are not safe" - and called for major intelligence changes. Its work is sure to reverberate across the presidential campaign.  In an exhaustive investigation of the deadliest attack in U.S. history, the commission noted numerous government missteps but did not cast blame on any official and stopped short of saying the hijackings could have been prevented. While the panel did not fault President Bush or former President Clinton, it did say both failed to make anti-terrorism a top priority.   "We do not believe they fully understood just how many people al-Qaida might kill and how soon it might do it," the 10-member, bipartisan panel said in its unanimous findings.   "We also believe that they did not take it as seriously as it should be taken. It was not their top priority," Thomas Kean, the Republican chairman, said at a news conference with members of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States. "We do believe both presidents could have done more in this area."   The final report, available on the commission Web site and at bookstores, largely mirrored the preliminary reports released during the commission's 20 months of investigation.  Coming less than four months before the election, the politically sensitive report could be trouble for Bush, who has made his handling of terrorism the centerpiece of his campaign and has insisted he fully understood the threat.    Family Members React to 9/11 Report    The report comes on the heels of House and Senate reports that documented U.S. intelligence failures and undermined the major claims cited by Bush to justify the war against Iraq. The commission report repeated its earlier preliminary findings that Saddam Hussein did not have a close relationship with al-Qaida and had nothing to do with the attacks.  Still, in the days after the hijackings, some in the Bush administration were seeking to make that link, the commission found.  Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, in a Sept. 17, 2001, memo to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, wrote that if there was "even a 10 percent chance" that Saddam had a role in the attacks, "maximum priority should be placed on eliminating that threat."  Despite Wolfowitz's arguments, Rumsfeld issued a memo to Pentagon commanders on Sept. 19 that addressed only al-Qaida, the Taliban and Afghanistan.      Bush welcomed the panel's recommendations as "very constructive,"    although his administration has reacted coolly toward a key proposal to establish a Cabinet-level national intelligence director. He said that "where government needs to act, we will."   Bush initially opposed the creation of the commission, resisted the release of some documents and fought against letting national security adviser Condoleezza Rice testify publicly under oath. Still Kean thanked Bush for allowing "unprecedented access to documents and cooperation from your administration."  Democrat John Kerry, campaigning for president in Detroit, said disputes within the Bush administration had delayed the commission's work and improvements to the nation's security.   "Nearly three years after terrorists have attacked our shores and murdered our loved ones, this report carries a very simple message for all of America about the security of all Americans - we can do better," Kerry said.   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., expressed doubt that lawmakers would have time to consider sweeping reforms this year. But efforts began in both the House and Senate to build bipartisan coalitions of support for the recommendations. Relatives of Sept. 11 victims said they would lobby, too.   "The families know that this is an election year. We're going to hold these people's feet to the fire," said Debra Burlingame, whose brother Charles was the pilot of the hijacked plane that struck the Pentagon.   The report portrayed the Sept. 11 terrorists as sure-footed and determined while the nation they were preparing to strike was unprepared, sluggish and uncomprehending of the imminent danger.   "Across the government, there were failures of imagination, policy, capabilities and management," the commission concluded in a 567-page indictment that documented a series of missed opportunities by the CIA and FBI to uncover the Sept. 11 plot. Nearly 3,000 people were killed when 19 Arab hijackers flew airliners into New York's Twin Towers, the Pentagon and the Pennsylvania countryside.   Three years later, Americans are safer because of improvements in homeland security and the war against terrorists, the report said.    "But we are not safe."      "Every expert with whom we spoke told us an attack of even greater magnitude is now possible and even probable," Kean said. "We do not have the luxury of time."  The commission's report said that as the Sept. 11 plot advanced, the U.S. government was bogged down in an outdated Cold War mentality, lacking imagination to deal with new threats or recognize the looming danger.   "What we can say with confidence is that none of the measures adopted by the U.S. government from 1998 to 2001 disturbed or even delayed the progress of the al-Qaida plot," the report said.   Commission co-chairman Lee Hamilton, a former Democratic congressman from Indiana, said a key finding was that no one in government was in charge of insuring that intelligence agencies pool resources, avoid duplication and plan jointly to keep America safe. To unify efforts, the commission recommended creating a national counterterrorism center.   It also recommended a Cabinet-level national intelligence director to centralize efforts now spread over 15 agencies in six Cabinet departments, including the CIA.  The report said Congress, like the executive branch, responded slowly to the rise of global terrorism.   But the panel found that the "most important failure" leading to the Sept. 11 attacks "was one of imagination. We do not believe leaders understood the gravity of the threat."   The commission identified nine "specific points of vulnerability" in the Sept. 11 plot that might have led to its disruption had the government been better organized and more watchful. Despite these opportunities, "we cannot know whether any single step or series of steps would have defeated" the hijackers, the report concluded.   Some members have speculated the attacks could have been stopped. "We do not know," Kean said. "We think it's possible. But we have not drawn that absolute conclusion because we don't believe that absolute conclusion is justified by the facts."   The report detailed contacts between Iraq and al-Qaida, noting that Osama bin Laden began exploring a possible alliance in the early 1990s. The report said that an Iraqi delegation traveled to Afghanistan in July 1998 to meet with the ruling Taliban and with bin Laden.   While there were "friendly contacts" between Iraq and al-Qaida and a common hatred of the United States, none of these contacts "ever developed into a collaborative relationship," the report said.   That question has been the subject of intense political debate, as critics accuse Bush of exaggerating the contacts between al-Qaida and Iraq to justify the war.  The panel said it did not find evidence that Iran, Iraq's neighbor, had advance knowledge of bin Laden's plans, or that Saudi Arabia's government had a role in the terror conspiracy, which involved    15 Saudi hijackers.            &nbsp;        &nbsp;     So... what does all this mean?

      I heard the dreaded news this afternoon on my way home from work. RAIN this weekend. How can I enjoy the $700.00 plus membership and bond fees for the Clifton Swim Club when it rains and is cold on weekends? Hot as a griddle today, sweated my kuhunies off. Now, this weekend? 78 and rainy. I think that there is something sinister going on. Really.   &nbsp;  Off to better things... Here's something that makes me conclude that the Federal government and others got away with MURDER.   &nbsp;    9/11 Commission Releases Final Report : The September 11th Commission concludes that a "failure of imagination," not governmental neglect, allowed 19 hijackers to carry out the deadliest terrorist attack in US history.   The panel calls for an intelligence overhaul to confront an al-Qaida organization intent on striking again.   While faulting institutional shortcomings, the bipartisan report "   does not blame President Bush or former president Clinton for mistakes"    contributing to the 2001 terrorist attack.   The report, which is the culmination of a 20-month investigation into the plot that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania, describes the meticulous planning and determination of hijackers who sought to exploit weaknesses in airline and border procedures by taking test flights.      Coincidentally?,    a surveillance video that surfaced Wednesday shows four of the hijackers passing through security gates at Dulles International Airport in Washington shortly before boarding the plane they would crash into the Pentagon.   In the video (left), the hijackers can be seen undergoing additional scrutiny after setting off metal detectors, then being permitted to continue to their gate.   White House officials and congressional leaders were briefed on the panel's findings, and Bush was presented a copy about 9:30am by the commission's chairmen, just before the 11:30am public release on the commission's web site and in bookstores.   The president said he looked forward to reading it. He also said Wednesday his administration was doing everything possible to combat terrorism, a major theme of his re-election campaign:   "Had we had any inkling whatsoever that terrorists were about to attack our country, we would have moved heaven and earth to protect America. I'm confident President Clinton would have done the same thing. Any president would."   One administration official said the 575-page report concludes that Bush and Clinton took the threat of al-Qaida seriously and were "genuinely concerned about the danger posed by al-Qaida," but didn't do enough to stop the terrorist organization headed by Osama bin Laden.   There was a "failure of imagination" to provide either Bush or Clinton with new options -- particularly military approaches -- to deal with al-Qaida, the official said. There also was a failure to adapt to the post-Cold War era, and people just kept trying the same kinds of things that didn't work, the official said.   As expected, the report will propose a national counterterrorism center headed by a new cabinet-level national director of intelligence. The director would have authority over the CIA, FBI, and other agencies, while congressional oversight also would be strengthened.    Out of all of this I get 575 pages of LIES and deception. It took all of 30 hours for the MEDIA to brand this magical group called Al- Quidea or whatever from "Credible" sources to tell the sheeple that 19 "Arabs" caused this. I tell you that it took millions of man hours and millions of dollars to catch the unibomber.   To the 911 commission I say BULLSHIT. And here's another FACT. I am NOT one of those "Conspiracy Nuts" that the media and those in politics are quick to label anyone who questions the government. There is too much proof, and hopefully those who read this post will search the internet and find these FACTS that YOUR government is trying to hide or twist.   Look. I care about my community here in Clifton Heights. And also the whole of Delaware County and the state of Pennsylvania. Go farther and I care about the whole of the United States. Just think of those words for a minute or two. "United States". So, why then if were so united does the federal government seem to pit each against the other? Why are "Lobbyist" allowed? To me they are legalized whores spending YOUR tax dollars and kissing up to these so called senators who only "care" about you when it's election time.   Ok. As always, I have to stop. But think about it. Don't put your religion or party affiliation in front of your fellow man or woman.   Cheers.   P.S. Vote wisely in November.

      THEM'S FIGHTIN' WORDS  By Jay O'Three   WASHINGTON, DC - 7/11/04 Today, Tommy Ridge of the Fatherland Security administration and John ASSCROFT of The Department Formerly Known as Justice proclaimed that we are not even entitled to an election next November 2. Although we predicted this eventuality on April 1 of this year, the two of them have now actually begun exploring the legal means to prohibit Americans from voting The MORONARCHY out of power. They claim this stems from their intense fear of a terrorist attack, even though President MORON insists every day that "Amerkins are safer today than ever before." Well, them's fightin' words. There will be an election, or there will be an insurrection. Either way, The MORONARCHY must end.   Well, I am divided on this site. Part of me laughs at this late hour, the other cringes at the prospect of it being the truth. But I am comforted by the fact that Delaware County is full of devoted conservative people. Translated: If things locally are ok, what the hell, vote for Bush. After all, it's the delconian thing to do you know...   And while were on the subject of conservatives, Gil Spencer is losing it. This guy is so right wing it's pathetic. But then again, look who he works for...  &nbsp; &nbsp; The Chimp has got to go. Sign on McCain and We"ll vote.  Niters.

      In the week before 911, there was a 1200% increase in trading activity of orders to go short on the stocks of American and United Airlines. Going short is betting the value of a stock will go down. 98% of the activity came from one investment firm - Deutsche Banke /AM Brown -The former CEO and Chairman of that firm -----George Tenet    Posted on yahoo message boards...    Well let's talk about 911 for a moment. We were all horrified that day to what was transpiring in front of us. I remember driving on the Blue Route going to an estimate in Radnor. I arrived and my fellow master electrician Anthony Tori&nbsp; told me what was going on. It was about 10:00. We walked into the building and watched the 2nd plane hit the building. A wave of panic hit me. We were under attack.  &nbsp;  I was numb and didn't know what was going on. Were schools in Delaware County next? I left and went to Super Fresh in Manoa where my wife Liz was working. When I arrived, she was out back sitting in the car listening to KYW. Like me, she was worried and fearful for our children at school.&nbsp; I told her that I was going to pick them up as her boss Bob Witt told all the employees they couldn't leave.  &nbsp;  As I arrived at Garrettford elementary school there were other parents already in the lobby. I went in and had to sign a "emergency sick leave note" to get them out. One teacher (I won't mention her name) said that we (the parents) were "Over Reacting".&nbsp; Well, if we were next to be attacked, I wanted my sons with me at home.  &nbsp;  Anyway, as we left the school, my younger son Nicky asked me what was going on. I told him nothing was. The first lie. We went into WAWA and bought some coffee and candy and smokes.&nbsp; went home and watched the TV all morning and afternoon. Liz came home from work later and the rest I won't go into as you all experienced it in your own way.  &nbsp;  So, here are some  facts  concerning 911.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  The night before, on September 10th, President Bush and his staff stayed at the Colony Beach Resort an upscale and relatively pristine tropical island enclave located directly on the Gulf of Mexico, a spindly coral island ... Off Sarasota, Florida." [ urlLink AP, 07/29/01 ] .  &nbsp;  After a private dinner with various Florida politicians (including his brother Jeb) and Republican donors, Bush went to bed around 10:00 p.m. [ urlLink Sarasota Magazine, 11/01 ,  urlLink Washington Post, 1/27/02 ] Surface-to-air missiles were placed on the roof of the resort [ urlLink Sarasota Herald-Tribune, 9/10/02 ], and an Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) plane circled high overhead. [Fighting Back: The War on Terrorism - From Inside the Bush White House, by Bill Sammon, 10/02, p. 25] It's not clear if this type of protection was standard for the president or whether security was increased because of possible threats.&nbsp;  Since when does the President's staff go around placing AA guns of roof? Is that standard procedure?   &nbsp;The next day, at Booker elementary school, President Bush seemed perplexed as he was told about the aircraft hitting the second building's what did the Commander in Chief do with the knowledge that the United States was under attack?     He did nothing.   Bush did not say one word. He did not ask Card any questions. He did not give any orders. He did not know who (or which country) was attacking, whether there would be more attacks, what military plans had been taken, what military actions should be taken - indeed, he knew virtually nothing about what was going on outside the room. He just sat there.&nbsp;  If we were "Under Attack" like we all thought, then why the null responses?       The Pentagon, Norad, and standing down:&nbsp; Now why when our government knew about four aircraft being off course, and after the first impact, did they do nothing? Over an hour with not one fighter being scrambled.&nbsp; I could go on here, but I just get upset about all of this. More questions in a nut shell.  Who shorted the stock the day before? How do buildings "Collapse" like that? Why was the Media so quick to label Al-Queida? Why were the&nbsp;five Israelis in New Jersey let go? Who had the most to gain financially?  Enough rambling... And I welcome all replies.

       I finally figured it out. All you have to do is put the words  urlLink Delaware County  like this in your blog and hope other people with blogs link to yours. It also helps if you list things to do in Delaware County, such as go ice skating at the  urlLink Skatium . Or maybe go to the&nbsp; urlLink Media Courthouse  and watch a trial. Any word that you link to your homepage will work. Even if you think that  urlLink George Bush   urlLink is an Idiot , and will never win against  urlLink John Kerry  in November, its safe to say that&nbsp;with the  urlLink GOP leaders  in  urlLink Springfield , like  urlLink Charlie Sexton , and  urlLink Gil Spencer  (My old buddy) at the  urlLink Daily Times ,  urlLink President Bush  WILL be Re Selected, er, I mean Elected.    &nbsp;  So, what else is new? Oh yeah, I didn't go to the  urlLink Clifton Heights Swim Club  today because of the  urlLink Chemtrails . Ha Ha. Lets see if by next week  urlLink Google  and  urlLink Yahoo  search engines move my link up any when you type in the search  urlLink Delaware County .    &nbsp;  Cheers.    &nbsp;  P.S. Mike, Give me a call tonight or tommorow on the  urlLink land line .

      Well now, it's quite early in the morning and I am awake. Yesterday, while at work at one of the schools installing lights in a new classroom, I spotted the below. (Thanks for the picture Mike)      Now, I ask you. Is Dan Quayle working there? Really. I try my hardest to spell check  everything  I publish, but this coming out of a school is hard to belive! The good thing is that with a utility knife and whiteout, it can and will be fixed the next time I visit. For curiosity sake I did a google search on the word "potatoe" and what comes up fourth?  urlLink You guessed it.   Moving right along, I am reading the  urlLink Daily Times  at this early hour and see that an Ex-Nun has been convicted of molesting a then 10 year old student back in 1970. I attended a catholic grade school and never had any nun make a move on me other than to slam me into a black board or whack me with one of those pointers. (Lucky Me.) Needless to say, I hope the old perv gets what's coming to her. There has been a rash of pedophiles in the area lately. Most members of our web portal (All three of them)know about the old man behind my house who is a convicted child rapist. They also know that I have had words with him a concerning my younger daughter.  What amazes me is that most pedophiles do NOT believe they are doing anything wrong. This asshole behind me will strike again, and until then he supossedly has rights. Yeah, you read it right, RIGHTS! Enough about this guy, he ain't worth the effort.  That's about it, my coffee is ready.  Have a nice day.

      It's been 7 years since my Dad passed away. Funny how it still bothers me. I thought that I was over it but find that I have a heavy heart. My Dad was 74 years old when he died of Pancreatic cancer. I remember him being in terrible pain.   My Dad and I were close as father son relationships go, but in the early years, he was always out drinking. It got so bad that he wound up in the VA hospital in Coatesville and then to Haverford Mental hospital for alcohol treatment. I guess after serving in WW2 where he was a POW in Germany and Korea where he was wounded would make anyone abuse the stuff.  Finally, in 1970, he quit. I remember going out to Liberty Bell race track and then dining at the Mari Nay diner. Boy he gambled a lot! My summers consisted of working for him cutting grass on the main line. He had over 60 lawns, but I remember one on Coopertown Rd. The residence was the Millers. They were about the nicest people to my Dad, and he appreciated them as he would remind me just about every other week.  He was most off all well know in the Irish community as an excellent violinist and accordion player. He loved his music, and the people he played with. Mary & Kevin Mcgillin, Barney Boyce, Pat Collins, and Vince Gallagher come to mind.. I had good memories of my Pop.  Rest easy Dad.

       Seems that this "WAR" will never end.      Haverford Marine injured in Iraq    07/04/2004   By KATHLEEN E. CAREY kcarey@delcotimes.com HAVERFORD -- Two days after three members of the Marine Corps Reserve Unit from Folsom died and two others were injured in Iraq, a Marine from Haverford was seriously injured after his vehicle ran over a land mine.   Cpl. Jason Michael Simms, 26, was serving with Delta Company, Third Platoon, 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion,stationed outside Fallujah on July 1 when he and three others riding in a light armored vehicle drove over the mine.  One Marine from Tennessee died. One suffered minor injuries, and the other two, including Simms, continue to be treated.  "We don’t know the extent of his injuries," his dad, Jim Simms Jr. said.  Jason Simms’ parents do know their son is stabilized after surgery in Iraq. They said he has shrapnel in the left side of his body and has been quarantined to prevent infection to his burns.  On Thursday, the Simms’ were told Jason would call.   "We still haven’t heard from him," Jim Simms said Saturday. "We should have heard from him by now."  The family waits by the phone.  "It’s like all this going on with the Folsom guys and then this the next day," Simms’ mom, Mary Jean, said from her Grand Avenue home, as two Marine Corps flags flew outside.  The Simms said their son will be moved to Germany once he’s stabilized.  "He could be on his way there now or it could be in 24 hours," Mary Jean said. "We don’t know when. From Germany, he’ll come back to the states."  The 1996 Haverford High School graduate joined the Marines that following January.  "He said he was interested in the challenge," his father said. "He mentioned he wanted to serve the country. And, because ‘Once a Marine, always a Marine.’"  Simms’ parents were surprised, but they supported his decision.  After serving in Hawaii, Jason signed up for another tour last September.  "He missed it," Jim said. "He liked the camaraderie."  In February, Simms went with his unit to Iraq to replace the Army’s 101st Airborne Division, rejecting a Jacksonville, Fla., assignment.  "He had a chance to get out of it," his mother said. "(But) he’d rather stick with his unit."  Before he left, Jason encouraged his parents to get passports so they could go to Germany in case he was injured.  And although he is en route there, his parents have been told to stay in Haverford in anticipation of his homecoming.  His mom remembers learning of his Iraq deployment. "Just like everybody, you think he’ll be fine," she said. "You don’t expect him to get hurt."  His dad said, "It’s where he wanted to be."  In a letter to his sister, Lindsay, Jason wrote, "You don’t know how lucky you are to live in America."  When American troops went door-to-door looking for Saddam Hussein, Jason saw a woman with four children and a baby lying on the floor in a house the size of his Haverford bedroom.  Ascertaining that the baby was in bad shape, Jason gave them whatever food and water he had.  Jason last talked to his parents on Father’s Day, wishing his dad the best and aching to be with his 4-year-old son, Jason Jr.  "Obviously, we are hoping to hear from Jason pretty soon," Jim said. "It’s something you always thought about. It was no consolation for me to hear him say, ‘Don’t worry about me.’ That’s like saying ..‘Don’t snow.’"  If he could see the second of his four children, Simms said, "I wouldn’t say anything." All he would do is embrace his Jason, to envelope him, showing him the love and pride a father has for a son.     ©The Daily Times 2004

Needless to say, I've spent over 2 days formatting the HD and re installing XP.  On Saturday we had a parade. Clifton Heights always throws the best parade and fireworks.

      I read the  urlLink haverfordblog  every day and lately it's turning into a soap opera. Grown Men & Women acting like little kids slinging mud and saying shit about  " this one is no good "  and such... Cripes, maybe someonme could write a book about it and make some money! Now I realize that the webmasters of the blog have good intentions about it, but it pains me to see it turn into nothing more than a Storm Drain.  Good debates are worth reading and interacting with.  but what we have here are lawsuits, threats, and just general nastiness. They all  abound on the blog. But, hey! I enjoy reading it. Am I sick or what? I don't even live in Haverford but have worked there for over 20 years.Btw, I was in PEABODY'S on Friday. So, Why don't all the concerned bloggers of the Haverford Blog all get together at say the old Iron Gate or hell, WAWA for the   teetotallers   i.e (teetotal adjective never drinking alcohol or opposed to the drinking of alcohol teetotaller UK, US USUALLY teetotaler noun {C}and just have some fun!  I just posted this reply to two combatants. Re: Curt Weldon's mailer - week of 8/9/2004 « Reply #2 on: Today at 1:16am »  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'll be quite honest with both of you. Both Bush AND Kerry are losers. America is controlled by corporations, lawyers,and our "Friends" abroad. WE are all sheep, who instead of banding TOGETHER, fight and argue over being a Republican or Democrat, Liberal or Conservative,White or Black, Gay or Straight.  I consider myself to be an AMERICAN, one who was revered in the world as being the most generous, outgoing people in the world.  Peace to all you HT'ers.  Ok. Bring it on! No, really guy and gals, lighten up. It's the weekend.  Cheers.

      She asked me tonight to shoot some more pictures. I had the camera,(an A-40 Canon)set at 1600X1200. The shots were not as good a clarity as I would expect. I am learning about this slowly! Well, you be the judge. (I reduced them a bit to 320X240 for my blog in Photoshop.) I think personally that if you knew her, you would agree that her personality does more for her than her good looks...

      Vanessa saw the picture of her sister Erica the other night. She asked me to take some shots of her so I did. She's 21 years old and one of the nicest women you can meet. And She's single too!   Beautiful Smile...     Yours truly hamming it up with "Nessie"   Nice to see that through all the heartache both Vanessa and Erica  and their family have been through concerning their brother Robbie, they still keep on Keepin' on.    God bless all of you!   Cheers Vanessa :-)  BTW. Here is some pictures of their Brother  Robbie Mac Neal.  He was involved in a devastating car wreck in New Jersey on December 14th, 2003. He was in a coma for months and was first in Cooper Medical Center, then transferred to Jefferson , then onto Moss Rehabilitation Center. Many people have been touched by Robbie's resolve, one that's far greater than the "Chimp" that currently resides in the White House.                 Robbie had been in that wheel chair now for 9 months, something to think about. The Accident involved no booze, no drugs, no speeding... Just some rotten black ice doing 50 M.P.H. coming home from a job he and his friend got selling discounted phone services while attending his freshman year at Neumann Collage. My heart has gone out to the kid who used to come up into my garage at 3 AM to inquire what the hell I was doing on my computer at that time of night, (Yes, I was banished to the garage by my wife at the time because of over indulging in the use of the motherboard. And that's another story.} Anyway, I'm working on a tribute section on the Totally Delco website that will be available in a few weeks.   Until we 01 again.

      A guest posts:   Christians are called to emulate Christ. As He lived His life here on earth. That's all we have to go by. The suffering Christ, not the vanquishing one yet to come. We are to follow Him to the cross if necessary, and are commanded to love those who crucify us. "Love your enemies" are His exact words.  Jesus Christ did not "fight back". He did not "kick ass". He did not endeavor to destroy his enemies, or support those that were doing so. Rather, He COMMANDED us as Christians to LOVE them. UNCONDITIONALLY, as He loves us.  Jesus Christ did not bomb women or children for any reason whatsoever. Nor would He ever condone or support such behavior. Jesus Christ abhored the behavior of Pharisees who prayed publicly and exploited their faith while doing evil behind the scenes. Nor would He have anything at all to do with, or support any kind of "War on Terrorism" whatsoever.  Tough words. Tough commandments. Hard to live by. Even harder to die by. But undeniable. IF you're a Christian and believe in what the Bible says about Jesus Christ's life.  Jesus Christ also warned of those who would come after Him, come in His name, claiming to be doing good in His name, but instead doing unspeakable evil. He warned all Christians against these people, telling us that they would come as "Angels of Light". He didn't go into specifics, but if He had, He might have said that they would promise to appoint judges to end abortion, promise to fund "faith-based" ministries and schools, and cast stones at rivals who "wanted to destroy the family by supporting abortion, voting against parental notification rights, give the 'morning-after' pill to our children," etc., etc.  I hope you get my point by now. The AntiChrist will not come saying "I am evil, follow me". On the contrary, he will say "I am good personified, I will make the world a better place and give all that believe in me and support me everything they want that is good. I will protect the weak and innocent and make peace, and destroy all evildoers."  I'm not saying Bush is THE AntiChrist, but he certainly qualifies as an antichrist, because every single thing he says, and most importantly, does, goes DIRECTLY AGAINST EVERYTHING that JESUS CHRIST taught, lived, believed, and DIED FOR.  It is time for the Moral Majority and all who identify themselves as "Fundamentalist Christians" to decide what they really are; followers (emulators) of Christ or members or supporters of a worldly power-seeking political movement. YOU CANNOT BE A MEMBER OR SUPPORTER OF ONE and BELONG TO THE OTHER.  Jesus Christ eschewed (avoided to the greatest extent possible) politics and political power at every turn in His life, and His own people turned on Him as a result, desiring a "strong" leader who would come as a conquerer and throw off the occupation of the Romans. There was a reason for this and He said it over and over again in His life; that the world of the Spirit was more important than the world of Man and that the world of Man would fall away and amount to nothing. Suffering to prove you loved your enemies was far more important than vanquishing them.  But aren't we expected to make the world a better place? Absolutely. And Jesus told us how, by LOVING OUR ENEMIES. How do we do that? Find out what they want, why they want it, give it to them, and then give them more. If they ask for our shirt, to give them our cloak also. If they ask for our life or the lives of our loved ones, so be it. First Century Christians went to their deaths in the arena singing and praising God, rather than fight the Romans. How does this make the world a better place? By letting Christ's love so shine through us that all come to Him, by choice and free will. Not by coercion, and certainly not by force, murder, destruction, and worst of all, revenge. Unconditional Love is the only way to true lasting peace. Those First Century Christians' witness converted first a handful, then an emperor, then an entire empire, and eventually the entire world came to know of Jesus. Would this have happened if they died fighting against overwhelming odds? How many other ethnic or religious groups that died fighting the Romans do we know anything at all about today?  Brothers and Sisters in Christ, I do NOT want you to stand before God at the final reckoning and have to experience the following: God asks you what you were doing when Bush was bombing women and babies (whatever Bush's reason; it doesn't matter) and you tell God "We were fighting to keep a hunk of rock in a courthouse" or "We were fighting to keep doctors from killing unborn babies" or worst of all "We were fighting to keep what we thought was a Man of God in the White House doing your work, Lord."  A Christian can never lose their salvation, but they can lose their soul when they do what they feel is the right thing for all the wrong reasons. Or actually doing the wrong thing for all the right reasons. Jesus told us how to do the right thing for all the right reasons. It isn't easy. In fact, it's the hardest thing in the world to do. LOVE YOUR ENEMIES. But He also said He would help us do it, if we took the first step.  May God grant you the power of discernment and the power to see "Angels of Light" for what they are. Know them by their works, not by what they claim to be. And may you never be blinded by much lesser meaningless works of seeming good, while abominable acts of unspeakable evil occurr immediately behind them.  May God bless you and keep you,  Leslie Bell  P.S. You might say "What about the military? Doesn't somebody have to fight for freedom? What about our Christian young men and women in uniform?"  My answer is going to be very hard, but it is going to be what Jesus taught. As Christians, we aren't to worry about or ever partake in "fighting for freedom" or for anything else; there will always be men and women who will take any opportunity given them to kill for any reason whatsoever. As Christians we aren't to join them, period. God will decide their fate. We are commanded to LOVE OUR ENEMIES. This doesn't ever include bombing, maiming, or killing them for our freedom, their freedom, or anything else. For those that already have done these things, there is complete absolution and forgiveness for all those that ask. Killing is sin. If we have done so, we are called to stop. As individuals and AS A GOD-FEARING NATION.  Then what course of action is there left to take? Crying out the Truth, loud and long. That will be more than enough.

      What is it with this chick? First off, she seems to be a crybaby. Waaaaah! Waaaaah! I just saw her on TV. Unbelievable! She has her own Fragrance... It's called Curious Britney Spears. Well, I'm curious Brit. Just what are you going to think of next? Like those Hilton sisters, especially the one who looks like an Ethiopian. All that money, and Paris has to do porn movies like some low life crack whore from Darby.   Oh.. Before I go. You know there is a Britney lookalike? Yes. lookie here.     And here is "Her" without her makeup on.   It's a guy....  A dude. A sausage. A male. A human being with penile reproductive organs.  Now you see Brit, you have some comptition that even Mr.Marcavage could learn to like.  Off to bed. It's late.

       While reading the Daily Times this morning I came across an article sent in by Michael Marcavage, a man who lives in the borough. He proceeds to attack Kevin Lee, an openly gay man who recently was appointed to borough council.  He cites from the Bible, (Romans, Chapter 1,) that "God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet."  He goes on to explain that the laws of our nation were founded on the Bible, that it is of a moral foundation, one that dates back to the beginning of time itself. Well Mr. Marcavage, I agree with you, but only to a point. Yes I believe that God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. Men and Women are unique, and best physically equipped for intercourse with each other.  Mr.Marcavage goes on to quip about the borough soon requiring children to read amongst other things, Books entitled: "Heather Has Two Mommies" and "Daddy's Roommate". Good Luck, you'll need it but please quit driving around in a bus with posters plastered on it showing aborted fetuses. That's where I draw the line, such as when the governor was in Lansdowne certain people showed up and in front of these same young children, exposed graphic posters of aborted fetuses. If I were present, I would have grabbed the posters, tore them up, then proceed to punch out them all. I probably would have landed up in jail, but it would be well worth it.   That's why I love America.  Again, good luck with taking on the powers that be in Lansdowne.

      Here I sit with Erica, our 17 year old neighbor. Her brother is urlLink  Robbie , the young man who was tragically injured in a car accident in December of last year. Erica would like to become a model. I think that she has the potential to do it. In fact, tomorrow or over the weekend we will be doing a photo shoot (A portfolio?) of her for people to look at. Hopefully, someone who isn't a con artist and is REALLY connected with a reputable modeling agency will see the pictures and contact her thru me.  Hey, free publicity is better than paying $300.00 dollars to those so called Modeling agencys that tell you that scour the papers looking for couples with newborns and contacting them saying that thier kid is soooo cute, now gimme money to put them on a commerical that never happens...      Yes, and two things.. 1.Dont even think it and 2. It's not that I'm not a happy guy, it's just that I have really horrible crooked buck missing teeth and am embarrased. I need an extreme makeover. Vote for me on T.V. to get it done. I'm game.

       The above link was obtained from my referrer log file on the server. Now just where do you see me posting links to escorts from Delaware County? Honestly, Delco Women on the whole wouldn't stoop to that level... Well, I do know one, right Mike?  I wonder how old "Secret" and her pimp daddy are getting by these days? Still selling pizza's in Folcroft?

      I am kind of depressed about our web site www.totallydelco.com. I feel that it needs major help, new ideas from fresh minds. I started it mainly to provide links to businesses and such in and around Delaware County. I also wanted people to join the Web Portal so they could interact with the site. I will continue to work on the community pages and publish them in the next few months.  Any ideas are gladly appreciated.   Thanks.

      Yes... Think about it. I'm tired of this "Fear Factor". Just WHO does control the "government" anyway? In Delaware County, you have Tom Judge, Charlie Sexton, Nick Micozzie, and My favourite: John McNichol.

      Well I just cannot believe this! I went to visit my Mom down in Stonehurst. I couldn't get near her house because of the massive flooding at Marshall Rd and S. 69th. (Church La. To me.) Anyway, She has no power at all. While I was there, I went down the crick and lo and behold, my best friend Pete was there. He lives in Ridley but grew up with us down the park... Here are some pictures of what I'm talking about.                The local news says that Upper Darby had over 4" of rain. And I believe them!

      No, not the Avalon in New Jersey, this Avalon is in Nags head, North Carolina, the best place in the United States to vacation. My first visit there was in the Summer of '88, while Liz and I were going out for about a year. Her family had been going there since the early 70's and she told me what a wonderful place it was. She was right. After getting over the initial nervousness of crossing the Mason Dixon line for the first time, I felt like I was back in time.  The first thing we did was to stop at a 7 Eleven in s. Nags Head, right before you go into the national seashore drive. When I walked in, the clerk (A young girl) greeted me with: How y'all doing today? May I help you ? I was floored! try getting that greeting at a sev in Philly! Well, needless to say, our week there was great. two people in love alone in a sound front home was heaven to me. I didn't want to return.    Avalon's Pier's live web cam   We made several trips down to Nags Head, the last being last year (2003.) For some pictures,  urlLink Click Here . Any way, there are three main piers that I have been on in the Outer Banks. One, Jennette's Pier, started feeling the effects of Hurricane Isabel a few days after we left last year. It was totally destroyed. The second, Nags Head Pier, was also extensivly damaged but the buildings and pier remained standing. The third,  urlLink Avalon Pier , in Kill Devil Hills, was also heavly damaged. In all, these three piers are excellent places to fish from, or just sit on all night.

      Yep. The roof is still leaking, right over Liz's side of the bed. She let me know about it about an hour ago. Leaking like it was taking a leak. (It's Sunday). As I sit here listening to the rumbles of thunder heading towards New Jersey, I had to re boot my machine. The router (A new linksys) also had to be rebooted. This crazy weather we"ve been having in the Tri State area is the result of mother nature being pissed. Notice the non use of the word Chemtrails.  So, here's what I want to accomplish today.  1. Do the electrical work around the house that has been half done now since the ground outside was frozen. 2. Call somebody to check out the roof. (Fat chance on a Sunday) 3. Fix leak in ceiling of work van. 4. Install new hose bib and hose holder out front. 5.Visit mom and see what she needs done, if only to keep her company.
