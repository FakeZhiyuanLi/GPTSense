       July 29, 2004 Sydney, Australia    Peace Activists, David Burgess and Will Saunders argued they acted in self defence when they painted an anti war slogan (NO WAR) on the landmark Sydney Opera House.    This is part of the appeal against their conviction and sentencing to 9 months periodic detention    Justice Michael Adams, of the New South Wales Criminal court of appeal, said if that were the case, all terrorists could use self-defence to justify their actions.       Flashback to the slogan. Photo: Rick Stevens      The otherwise tame looking, tourist magnet, Opera House must have seemed terribly menacing to these Lotus position, flower hugging, greenies on that day as they defended their very lives. The public watched in fascination while the collaborating Gestapo security guards fired live ammunition and rocket propelled grenades against these paint brush wielding heros.     urlLink  Opera House graffiti 'an act of self defence'        29 July, 2004 The World    A spokesman for North Korea has accused the South of kidnapping its citizens after more than 450 defectors arrived by plane in the space of two days.    "This is an organised and planned kidnapping as well as a terror crime," North Korea's spokesman said. Quoted by the North's state news agency, the official from the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said the South Korean government and "other forces" involved would "pay a big price", but gave no details.    "It is the most hostile act ever committed by South Korean authorities to destroy the North Korean political system," the statement said, as monitored by South Korea's Yonhap news agency.    As journalists were kept at a distance, the new arrivals were whisked away to be debriefed by officials from government security agencies, in part to ensure that there were no spies among them.

       North Korea has rejected US suggestions that it follow Libya's lead and give up its nuclear ambitions.   Washington called on Pyongyang to renounce nuclear weapons to end its international isolation and qualify for economic aid. But North Korea called the US proposal a "daydream".   The rebuff came despite the US saying it is to donate 50,000 tons of food aid to North Korea. It said the gesture was unrelated to the nuclear negotiations.    "The US is foolish enough to calculate that such mode imposed upon Libya would be accepted by [North Korea] too," a spokesman was quoted as saying.    State department spokesman Richard Boucher said the donation of food aid, was "to help relieve the suffering of the North Korean people", not to influence the nuclear negotiations.   Hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of North Koreans are thought to have died from famine in recent years.       urlLink N Korea refuses to follow Libya      My Comments     I cannot understand how people like the 'Dear Leader' can just sit idly by whilst his own country men are dying of hunger, is it a type of mental blindness or just indifference.  I suppose I should be thankful that I cannot fathom how a person could do something like this.  North Korea has nothing the world wants, it has no oil, no gold, no minerals, no food for export, no livestock for export, the 'Dear Leader' has pretty much reduced the country to nothing.  There have been reports that the regime in Pyongyang is dealing in drugs and arms technology on the side in return for hard currency. There is also a lot of under the table support from the South, who don't particularly want to take on the responsibility of feeding their cousins in the North.  In the past Pyongyang has resorted to extortion, where they threaten their neighbours with arms and weapons of mass destruction, into donating food aid.  If it was not for the suffering of the common people this Dear Leader would be nothing more than an amusing act in an unpopular circus.  I think it is safe to assume that he firmly believes that the population's collective bellies are filled with the daily propaganda and the the very sight of the 'Great General' is enough to quench their thirst and dispel the pangs of hunger. I woudn't be surprised if the food aid is taken and the citizens told that the 'Great General', has once again defeated the imperialist America, and the food was but a bribe for sparing the life of the US President.  We can only hope and pray that some of this food aid will make it to the people who need it the most.    In this weeks edition of Time, there was an article on the latest navel gazing excerise about the pre war intelligence in Britian, the protesters were there in numbers I assure you, it must be upsetting knowing that another deranged fool much like the 'Dear Leader' has been thrown out, and God forbid they had a hand in it. One of the banners read 'Blair lied, thousands died'.  There were no quaint catch phrases for the long suffering Koreans, I suppose an adequate banner would be,   'Thousands die, nobody cares'.

        By Tim Judah in Tindouf, south-western Algeria       When one country invades another or a war starts we generally get to hear about it. Kuwait, Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo ... Western Sahara?   Over one thousand kilometres from Algiers, deep in the Algerian part of the Sahara near the town of Tindouf, 150,000 Saharawi refugees have had plenty of time to reflect on the iniquity of the world. Their country, Western Sahara, was invaded by Morocco in 1975, has no major oil reserves, a tiny population and no global strategic significance whatsoever. Hence the forgotten conflict.          Important visitor                  Mr Annan shakes hands with Polisario leader     On November 30 1998 Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary General, visited Smara, one of the Tindouf camps. He was there to meet the Saharawi's political leaders in a bid to break the political deadlock which has kept their people virtual prisoners in the desert for the last 23 years. Behind the scenes the UN is urging western powers to apply private pressure on Morocco's King Hassan in a bid to break the deadlock over one of Africa's longest running conflicts.      The Camps                  When Mr Annan visited Smara he was given a hero's reception. Thousands of women, their faces tinted blue from the indigo dye they use to protect their skin from the sun and sand ululated joyfully.                A forgotten people          Children waved placards demanding an end to the Moroccan occupation of their country while hundreds of soldiers from the Western Saharan Polisario Front gave the Secretary General a full military welcome.   Not a blade of grass grows naturally here and ever since 1975 the Saharawi refugees have survived thanks to aid and the little that they have, with great difficulty, managed to cultivate. They live in tents and mud huts but their camps are well run and clean. They have also poured what meagre resources they have into education meaning that this small refugee community in the middle of the desert has one of the best-educated populations in Africa. A high proportion of students are sent to universities either in Algeria or abroad.          The War           In 1975, just before the Spanish left their former colony they agreed to hand it over to Morocco and Mauritania.                        This was in defiance of a UN demand that the then 74,000 strong population give their own view in a referendum.   From then until 1991 Polisario fought a war against both countries. The Mauritanians were driven out by 1979 but the Moroccans proved a far more formidable foe. In 1981 they began building the Sahara's answer to the Great Wall of China. The earthwork ramparts that they built snake for 2,000 kilometres across the desert. Although successful in keeping the guerrillas at bay the war was still expensive and debilitating. In 1991 both sides agreed to implement a UN peace plan to be monitored by UN peacekeepers. They also agreed to hold a referendum on independence or integration into Morocco.         Human rights activists claim that since 1975 hundreds of pro-independence Saharawis have "disappeared" over the years. In their turn the Moroccans claim that Polisario have tortured and imprisoned dissenters.                  The UN and the Peace Plan           Ever since 1991 both sides have raised problems but now diplomatic sources say that the Moroccans are causing ever more delays because their strategy of packing the voters rolls with their own citizens has failed. The Moroccans have claimed that these people are Saharawis who live in Morocco. Without them though observers believe that Morocco would lose the vote and that Polisario would win a resounding victory in favour of independence. In that case Morocco would be obliged to leave the land it has claimed by historical right. If progress is not made within the first month or two of 1999 then Kofi Annan's plan to hold the much delayed referendum in December will collapse.   That is because of the huge amount of preparations that must go in to it, including the repatriation of the refugees. If that happens it will be delayed again. In public Moroccan officials say that they do not want any more delays. On December 2 1998 Abdellatif Filali, the Moroccan Foreign Minister said: "On the eve of the third millennium, I hope that we are equally on the eve of settling this problem once and for all."        Surprisingly Polisario officials are not at all downhearted by their years in exile and the prospect of further delays. As Radhi Bachir, a senior Polisario official explained, they are delighted by the way things are going. During the Cold War Polisario was associated with Cuba and Libya and so the west backed Morocco almost automatically.   Now the tiny guerrilla movement, which today has a mere 8,000 men under arms - compared to 120,000 Moroccans along the wall, has turned the diplomatic tables.                  Hanging on to hope     Morocco is now seen as obstructing peace and keeping the UN locked in a costly peacekeeping operation. As Mr Bachir puts it: "The wind is blowing our way". The Saharawis claim that one of the reasons that most of the world has never heard of them is because they have eschewed terrorism and kidnapping. The UN first called for a referendum on independence in 1965 - and the Saharawis are still waiting.         If Mr Annan Fails          If Mr Annan's mission fails then he has threatened to consider pulling his peacekeepers out of the territory. The last seven years have cost the UN $400m and Mr Annan, and the Americans especially, are loathe to keep on paying with no result in prospect.             Umm Deleila: Queen of the Desert         If the UN pulls out then war will return to this already troubled region.   During his visit to Smara Mr Annan was greeted by Umm Deleila, one of the most famous Saharawi singers. Her songs of exile and lament are broadcast on Polisario radio and it is said that those Saharawis who live in the Moroccan occupied part of the country tune their radios by night to hear her.   She said: "We have given blood, the dearest thing that every human has - so we are sure that we will receive something in return."         urlLink Contributing Articles from BBC News         urlLink Sahara women relish their rights

        North Korea      One of the few remaining countries in the world still under communist rule, North Korea emerged after world war II under    Kim Il-sung, the   Great Leader.    After the Korean War, Kim Il-sung introduced the personal philosophy of Juche, or self-reliance, which became a guiding light for North Korea's development, or as some would put it, lack thereoff.   Kim Jong-il the son of the 'Great Leader', Kim Il-sung took over in 1994 and is still ruling the country.      Last week I watched a documentary on North Korea, conducted by the BBC, I have read about the country before in numerous articles but never actually seen a documentary, which pretty much confirmed the harsh truth about this hermit kingdom. The documentary was far from freely undertaken and was more controlled than most state jails, yet they managed to reveal a lot about this particular basket case. The crew was greeted upon arrival by minders who accompanied the film crew everywhere and took them to the places where they (the state) wanted them to film and see.    First stop was the memorial to the 'Great Leader' Kim Il-sung, apparently people are regularly bussed from all over the country to pay tribute to the previous leader, an actor is employed to give a dramatic and herioc account of the 'Great Leaders' life to the visitors, basically she is given 2 minutes to extract a tear from atleast one of the gathered crowd. Everywhere the film crew were taken there were parties and celebrations, tributes to the 'Dear Leader' Kim Jong-il, or celebrations of their great victory over the enemy in the West. When they went into the country, the narrator mentioned that the roads were empty and that their's was the only car on the road for miles on end. You see petrol is a bit of a luxury in North Korea, the common mode of transportation is animal drawn wagons. They paid a visit to a housewife in some rural village, obviously ochestrated, she spends her afternoons watching state run television, this state run television shows the same clip of military parades, conducted by North Korea's infamous army, under the appreciative eye of the 'Dear Leader' every hour, every afternoon, every day, every week and so it goes on.    They visited schools, where children as young as 7 and 8 are taught the name of the enemy, George W. Bush. Accoring to the official curriculum America started the Korean War 50 years ago, in a bid to take over Asia and colonize North Korea as well, to this day children and citizens alike are taught that South Korea is still under brutal US occupation and they would suffer a similar fate if not for the 'Great Leader' &amp; his son the 'Dear Leader', who incidentally also likes to be known as the 'Great General'. The citizens are taught that those who oppose the Kims are enemies and should be hated and killed without question.  While they were filming somewhere in Pyongyang, there was a power cut, as there usually is in most of the city, we were told that even though the city has to go about in the dark the memorials to the Kims are always lit, they even showed us a picture of North Korea from Space, the whole of the eastern seaboard of Asia, China, neighbouring South Korea and the middle east is awash with bright lights.  However in North Korea, I kid you not, I froze the image and counted 5 points of lights across the entire country. The accompanying minders were at pains to point out through much of the documentary that it really was a wonderful paradise, in defense of the minders, the BBC crew could fly out under international protection when it was all over, whilst the minders would have to face Kim's secret police if they did not tow the line.    Then came the horrors, the stories told by people who had escaped from North Korea, the political gulags, the famine that has killed an estimated 3 million North Koreans in the last 3 years, the prison camps where people are held without charge, beaten and tortured for merely being suspected of threatening the regime. Apparently, they apply a hereditory rule, it works like this, if you are suspected of being a spy or working against the state, no one really cares if you are guilty or not, not only are you punished, but your offspring for the next 3 generations also stand condemned, babies of female political prisoners are usually killed upon birth. Children are made to endure imprisonment along with their parents this is to rid the bloodline of the rebellious seed. They interviewed a officer who worked in one of these prisons, who defected to the South, he admitted quite frankly to beating prisoners on a daily basis for 3 years until the 'novelty' wore off and the priviledge was then given to the junior officers.    I shall not go into detail, the account of torture victims but the one account that seemed rather tame, compared to the rest, was when a prisoner was put into a room filled to the waist with water,   to cut a long and harrowing story    short, he was let out after 48 hours, you figure it out.  Other reports include chemical and biological testing and exprimentation on political prisoners, the above mentioned officer even recalled one of these tests which were conducted on a family, mother, father, daughter and son, just children. The defector said that when he saw the family's last moments, he knew this was wrong, that these were human beings with real emotions, not animals as they were indoctrinated to believe and that he finally had to leave.  I can safely say that my mind is pretty sanitised due to the abundance of blood and gore from Hollywood, but to go into more detail into these harrowing accounts is too sickening.    The documentary concluded by saying that the international community is pretty much turning a blind eye to the evil that is running the show in North Korea. They accused South Korea of preferring to maintain the 'status quo' and propping up Kim Jong-il to ensure that the regime does not collapse and they will then need to deal with the estimated 22 million starving cousins from the North. Yes the first step to failure is trying..  They said America is war weary and more interested in preventing Nuclear proliferation on the Korean Peninsula. In all fairness it is in the national interest of America, Australia and others to have the nuclear issue at the top of the priority list. The humanitarian side of it, I know, is being pursued as best as diplomacy allows. One has to understand, it's not easy dealing rationally with that lunatic in Pyongyang.  George W. Bush branded North Korea in an axis of Evil, blunt, simple and hard.    One can only hope that once the situation in Iraq is over maybe some of the American warships might decide to stop over in South Korea, give the 'Great General' something to squirm about.  If I was not a religious person I would probably give up on life after seeing that documentary, but thankfully I am and so I know there is a special place in hell reserved for perpetrators of this evil.     urlLink Contributing Articles from BBC News

      Excerpts from BBC Article   A Palestinian boy arrested with a bomb strapped to his chest has told the BBC he volunteered to become a suicide bomber to avoid going to school.  It had begun at 6am that morning after he had said a prayer and kissed his mother goodbye, telling her he was going to school as usual.  Instead he met some men from the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades who photographed him for his martyrs poster, fitted him with a bomb belt and despatched him to Israel - the nightmare of many Palestinian mothers.  "If I had told my mother she wouldn't have let me leave the house," he said.  "She would have yelled at me, cried and told me not to do it."  He added: "It's not suicide, it's martyrdom. I would become a martyr and go to my God. It's better than being a singer or a footballer. It's better than anything."     				  				  Hussam was arrested at the checkpoint four months ago

       Somalia's hope of a new era   By Grant Ferrett, BBC correspondent in Mogadishu   Continued lawlessness and the absence of a central government have deterred investment in Somalia. However, the recent opening of a Coca-Cola bottling factory in the capital Mogadishu, is the clearest sign yet of growing business confidence in the country.   Standing on the white sandy beach at the port of El Ma'an, looking out across the Indian Ocean, I could almost have been viewing a scene from 19th Century Africa. Hundreds of porters were wading waist-deep into the sea to bring ashore the cargo from dozens of small boats. On the horizon, anchored in deeper waters, were the large vessels from which the small boats had ferried their contents. El Ma'an handles several thousand tonnes of goods each day without the benefit of a quayside, never mind cranes or modern containers. The impression of having travelled back in time was spoiled only by the fact that the porters were carrying crates of empty Coca-Cola bottles. The new factory was due to open in Mogadishu within 24 hours, and was desperately short of bottles and crates. The ones I was watching being unloaded had come later than expected from neighbouring Kenya because of bad weather. El Ma'an cannot work when the waves are too big. Mogadishu has a modern port. It is a 15-minute drive from the new Coca-Cola factory, whereas the journey to El Ma'an takes more than an hour along an untarred road. The problem is that Somalia's warlords, who have helped to drive the country to destruction, cannot agree who should control the port. The result is that no-one at all uses it. It is the same with Mogadishu's international airport. Any attempt to re-open it could ignite another round of fighting, so travellers are forced to use airstrips many miles from the capital. El Ma'an is able to remain open because it is very well-defended.    Armed security   Standing on the beach surveying the scene with me, the port's head of security told me he was in charge of 1,500 gunmen and dozens of technicals - trucks which have been modified to carry big anti-aircraft guns. When I remarked that it sounded like an army, he proudly responded that it was indeed. He and his senior assistants had all served in the armed forces during the days when Somalia had a government. His men needed to be disciplined, he said, otherwise it would not provide security.   That discipline was not immediately apparent when I drove towards one of the checkpoints on the sandy track to the port.&nbsp; Groups of young men armed with AK-47s seemed to be engaged in an argument.&nbsp; One of them, who appeared no more than about 14-years-old, was sucking a lollipop.&nbsp; Another had his finger poised on the trigger of his gun, which was pointing menacingly forwards at waist height. He looked annoyed.&nbsp; As my personal militia of half-a-dozen gunmen drove through the checkpoint in a truck ahead of me - that is the standard bodyguard for any visiting Westerner in Mogadishu - there was a lot of shouting. I was not sure if the angry-looking gunman was telling my car to stop. As we drove on, he fired a single shot in the air. I prayed that he would not fire any more, and that my bodyguards would not fire back. He did not, and neither did they.  In spite of all the guns and the air of incipient violence surrounding El Ma'an, Somalis do not consider the man who controls the port, Abukar Omar Adam, to be a warlord.&nbsp;He is referred to as a businessman - the most prominent of a growing number who carry out trade and happen to need armed guards to protect their investments. Warlords, I am told, are those who generate income not by providing services, but by extorting money through their militia, for example at roadblocks. In recent months there have been signs that some of the warlords are losing influence. In May, one of them tried to seize control of El Ma'an, provoking more than a week of fighting during which thousands of people were displaced. Alternative employment  The warlord lost. Since then, many of his militia fighters have joined the businessman, and are now helping to protect the port. They are better paid, receiving $2.50 a day, and are given better food as part of the deal. The new Coca-Cola factory imported most of its equipment, including the bottling line, through the port.&nbsp;For the opening ceremony, the company increased the number of armed guards to more than 100.   But the man behind the idea, AbdiRisak Isse, a 37-year-old Somali whose family lives in Sweden, says the real security comes not from the guards with guns, but from the goodwill generated by the company. Its 400 shareholders come from all clans and all parts of Somalia.  It directly employs 130 people and suggests that thousands more will benefit indirectly, offering an alternative form of employment to being a gunman. The whole business community hopes that the arrival of Coca-Cola will in turn encourage more investment, and so help to promote security in Somalia. It is peace and nation-building through private enterprise. But for all their money and power, the businessmen are not yet strong enough to ensure the re-opening of Mogadishu's port.   For now, El Ma'an remains the only option.&nbsp;    urlLink Full Article from BBC News  &nbsp;

      I finally managed to track it down, the al-Jazeera website, although they prefer to call it  Aljazeera.    urlLink Knock yourselves out    I must find a way of getting these links on the side of the site, I just don't have the time to fiddle around with html code. Anyway on the way to finding al-Jazeera, I make it sound like some sort of quest, I happened to stumble upon another site, Jihad Unspun  urlLink Click Here .  Well I was in for a bit of a surprise, the Jihad Unspun was some sort of news website, just heavily biased, including links like 'Zionist occupation authorities'.  Anyway in the interests of wide exposure I decided to read one of the articles, Iraqi Resistance, I got bored after the first page, moved on to American Hegemony.  Basically 9/11 was a CIA, FBI, Pentagon, White House, NSA conspiracy. It even went so far as to claim that 4 of the hijackers trained with the US government, I think the only thing left out was the theory that 'Jews' somehow knew about it and stayed away from the twin towers on 9/11. The article seemed, on the surface, well put together and believable, it made several references to credible news sources like Newsweek, BBC, AP etc, no links, just dates and times which makes these sources hard to verify. I tried unsuccessfully to check out the newsweek reference, no luck. So much for that.   The al-Jazeera website was not quite what I expected, not as biased as I would have thought, not as independent or neutral either, I suppose that is to be expected, you can find non middle east stories, but you need to search for them and know what you are looking for. This does defeat the purpose somewhat and skews the amount of information being published. But none the less&nbsp;I stand corrected,&nbsp;I shall add them to my source of news and other stories. &nbsp;  Watch this space..

       Key excerpts in the UK Butler Report into Weapons of Mass Destruction  Key intelligence used to justify war with Iraq has now been shown to be unreliable, the Butler Report says. Mr Blair said he took "full responsibility" for any mistakes made, saying that they were in "good faith". "No one lied. No one made up the intelligence. No one inserted things into the dossier against the advice of the intelligence services," he told MPs.  The limitations of the intelligence in the September 2002 dossier were not "made sufficiently clear," with important caveats removed  The 45 minutes claim was "unsubstantiated" and it should not have been included without clarification - doing so led to suspicions it was there because of its "eye-catching character"  Intelligence was pushed to its "outer limits" but not beyond - and there was no deliberate distortion by politicians, any blame was "collective"  JIC chairman John Scarlett should still take up post of MI6 chief - but future intelligence chiefs should be "demonstrably beyond influence"  Since the war key claims based on intelligence from agents in Iraq, including claims the Iraqis had recently produced biological agents, had had to be withdrawn because they were "unreliable". There had been an "over-reliance" on dissident Iraqi sources and human intelligence in general.  Mr Blair told MPs he accepted mistakes had been made.  "The evidence of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction was indeed less certain and less well-founded than was stated at the time," Mr Blair said. But he said he had fully expected Iraq's WMD to be discovered by coalition forces. And he added: "I cannot honestly say I believe getting rid of Saddam was a mistake at all. Iraq, the region, the wider world is a better and safer place without Saddam."   urlLink  Full Article from BBC News    My Comments   There have been quite a few inquiries, reviews, commissions, investigations and other official forms of self examination amongst the coalition of the willing since the war. They are important and necessary to a point, that being we need to learn from the mistakes that were made, address the weak areas, strengthen what we can and try not to stuff it up again, ascertain whether any good came out of it and judge the outcome in a balanced fashion. On the flip side, it's all pointless to the critics of the war, as they will not be appeased by any of these tax payer funded exercises, only when we turn back time, invite ol Saddam around to a cup of tea, to which he responds 'Get Bent'. We then throw our hands up, wish the Kurds, the Shiites, the Kuwaiti's best of luck, nobody cares, try the Mukabarat hotline, will the critics be appeased. We don't have the time to be concerned with such trivial matters, we have our big macs, hip hop and for others, classical music, to get back to. Can someone please remind me, was it CNN (no it can't be, they're too biased), it must have been the fair and neutral al-Jazeera, that widely broadcast the numerous inquiries and commissions that Saddam instigated himself after the gassing of the Kurds in Halabja and that pesky Shiite rebellion in the south. My memory is failing me, I must be moving on in the years. We need to sit and nit pick, point fingers, assign blame, dig a nice and proper rut for ourselves, fear the future as we drag the past with us, learning from the past is irrelevant, dragging it along is more important, don't get back on the wagon, that way you cannot fall off, remind ourselves that the first step to failure is merely trying.

      BMW's M5 will become the world's quickest sports saloon when it hits the streets in 2005, capable of blitzing to 100km/h in just  4.7sec  and a theoretical top speed in excess of  330km/h , though it will be voluntarily limited by BMW to 250km/h. The BMW M5 will be launched in Europe in January 2005 and CarPoint sources indicate a mid-2005 Aussie launch carrying a price tag around $220,000.  The M5's 5.0-litre V10 sets a number of new benchmarks for BMW, not the least being the first production V10 from BMW, and capable of revving to  8250rpm . With 378kW (507hp), it's the most powerful production engine BMW offers, and is only the second naturally aspirated volume BMW engine to exceed 100hp per litre after the 321hp, 3.2-litre M3 coupe. BMW claims the rear-wheel drive M5's seven-speed sequential manual gearbox (SMG) can change gears quicker than "even the most proficient driver" in a conventional manual. It can be driven in automatic mode, or actuated manually via either wheel-mounted paddles or a good old- fashioned gear lever.   The techno feast continues with a new Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) system that has been specifically developed for the M5 and offers three modes of control over the M5's power and chassis tuning. The standard mode will not allow any significant wheelspin or chassis drift and is suited to less aggressive driving. The second mode, called MDynamic, will allow the driver to fully exploit the M5's traction and performance with a higher intrusion threshold.   The M5 gets a new drive option called MDrive, which allows customising by the driver of the chassis, gearchange, suspension dampers and dynamic stability control systems via the iDrive system. The M5's high performance sports seats now feature side bolster adjustment to better keep the driver in place during high G manoeuvres. Stopping power hasn't been neglected with a monstrous set of cross-drilled ventilated discs with aluminium sliding twin-piston calipers mounted behind the standard 19-inch alloy wheels. Measuring 374mm across at the front and 370mm at the rear, the M5's discs can stop the M5 from 100km/h in 36m. Huge 255/40ZR19 front and 285/35ZR19 rear tyres have been specifically developed for the M5 to strike a balance between ultimate grip and ride quality.   urlLink Full Article from CarPoint    My Comments   *Why limit the top speed to 250Km/h? Maybe BMW is trying to maintain some inkling of responsibility. *With 378kW (507hp) of power going to the rear wheels, it's time BMW started looking at All Wheel Drive technology, Note the amount of fat rubber wrapped around the rear alloys. *I wonder if the high revving nature (8250rpm) of this V10 Engine will impact on long term reliability. *BMW's legendary history of delivering benchmark performance, on both straight line highways and winding country roads make this one scary piece of machinery. *Anyone behind the wheel of this automobile will have the time of their life scaring the bejeezus out of other motorists.

      Dr Leonard Okello is the Ugandan head of ActionAid's HIV/Aids work and is leading the agency's team at the International Aids Conference. He is also an Aids widower bringing up three daughters following his wife's death. My day starts when most dads are nicely cuddled up in their beds.   As early as 5am I am up to check on my two daughters who are eight and nine years old. My eldest daughter is HIV positive. I am a single parent. Meetings like the 15th International Aids Conference here in Bangkok offer some source of hope.  But we must be true to each other in consolidating the strategies that have worked, be frank with each other, and forge meaningful partnerships as we respond to the vicious epidemic.  I have known HIV when not so many people were free to talk about it as is happening today.   Family tragedies   My dear wife died on 9 May 1999. Two weeks later we buried her two sisters, who both died from Aids. The following week we buried my wife's brother. I have since buried my two brothers, two sisters, two aunts and two uncles. I have a brother whose health continues to deteriorate because he has Aids.   Since the conference opened on Sunday I have walked to almost every stall offering information on treatment so that I have the most current information to benefit my daughter Smiley who is on anti retroviral drugs (ARVS). It's amazing what advances are being made. There is even a serious discussion on vaccines. But the question that remains hanging is when these ARVs will become accessible to all, in line with the conference theme of access to all.    Trying to understand   I have made a personal commitment to understand the disease and do everything possible to improve the quality of life of my daughter and the many others I am in contact with. The first time ARVs came to Uganda, I was paying more than US$1,000 a month. The prices have since come down - thanks to the international pressure on the pharmaceutical companies. However, the price of ARVs to this day remains beyond the reach of many Ugandans, even the middle classes.   The noble initiative by the World Health Organisation to get 3 million people on ARVs by year 2005 will remain a dream unless there is movement in ensuring sustainability, expansion of delivery of treatment, poverty reduction and overcoming the inequalities that we see in our everyday life. The challenge calls for a committed leadership, at all levels, prepared to do business differently and putting people living with HIV and AIDS at the centre of any response.  Above all we will need to put women and women's rights issues in the centre of this fight.    Frustration   My greatest frustration at this conference has been in the leadership front. We seem to know the answers to the problems of the epidemic but are skating around them, not hitting the answer.   I have openly expressed my feelings at all sessions I have been to.  The war we are in calls for action packed political action and not more commitments. The HIV and Aids problem will only be won if world leaders from George W Bush of the US to the president of Tuvalu with 12,000 citizens make political decisions to mobilise citizens and resources to fight the epidemic and deliberately build capacity at all levels in all countries.   These leaders need to put their flags aside in favour of the war against Aids. I look forward to that day.   urlLink Full Article from BBC News

      I remember when the story about the Iraqi prisoner abuse broke, another story broke in Israel. While the prisoner abuse was widely condemned as it should be, those flinging the accusations, foaming at the mouth, burning American flags hysterically, shrugging off their own sins etc. They were deafeningly silent about a pregnant Jewish woman shot in cold blood by Palestinian gunmen, her four daughters who were with her also shot dead, brave honorable men that they were, freedom fighters and martyrs, ready to give their lives against the occupation. She must have been driving around in an Israeli tank, her children manning the machine guns and sporting sniper rifles. The 'emerging' (it was a fully fledged) crisis in Sudan also slipping under the radar. Last night i saw an interview of a Sudanese diplomat in America, refusing to acknowledge the part the government is playing in the crisis in Darfur, Sudan. It's widely accepted that the predominantly Arab government is persecuting the Black Africans in Darfur, you would be hard pressed to find al-Jazeera there.  Yesterday I read about a car bombing in the city of Baquba, Iraq. Apparently the 9 Iraqis killed were attending the funeral of two men who were shot dead a day or two ago. A witness said the bomber drove into the funeral gathering and blew himself up. It was confirmed later that there were no Coalition forces present in the area and it looks like the targets were Iraqi civilians. Not content with killing whoever, but waiting for the funeral to kill more people related to the original victim. On Tuesday 6 July a previously unknown group called 'Salvation Movement' in Iraq, issued a public warning to Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi to leave Iraq on pain of death. "We will do to you what the coalition forces have failed to do.", said the group, who appeared armed and masked. The statement accused the fugitive of "heinous acts which killed innocents" in attacks across Iraq.  "What religion is he clinging to? Islam is a religion of forgiveness," it said, condemning the murder of foreign workers and threats against interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi.  urlLink   Article from BBC News    al-Zarqawi and his band of vermin always appear in videos with hostages kneeling before them brandishing automatic weapons, hooded and can only shoot the tied up victim from the back or cut his throat from behind, brave souls that they are. Isn't it ironic, that their fate could probably be delivered by similarly masked men.  Last week in Time i read an article about the insurgent movement in Iraq, there are more foreigners militants in Iraq now, backed by wealthy Saudis and other sources masquerading as charities, to cut a long story short, when the reporter finally asked them if their Jihad would be over if the Americans left Iraq, to this they replied, we will follow them back to America, so much for the liberation of Iraqis from the imperialist America. Then al-Zarqwi  released videos of suicide bombers amongst his complex network of Jihad. A video showed a bomber on his way to blow up a bridge using a rigged tanker, smiling and hugging all his fellow Jihadists before setting out on his campaign. If women and children had been on that bridge, too bad, infact the more the merrier.  The very nature of a suicide bomber is the higher the number of those killed, whether they are innocent or guilty is irrelevant, the better. The point of the suicide bomber is achieving martyrdom, giving his or her life for Islam in return for a place in heaven, apparently the men will be given around 70 (could be 100) virgins, not sure what treasures the female sex will be bestowed with, maybe it's equal rights or something.  In light of all this one has to stop and think, why do they hate so much, I've been told that they are at the end of their tether, it's the last resort, they have nothing else to fight with. On the point of hate, i still remember watching a documentary a few years ago about Palestinian refugee camps, a small girl of maybe 10, even less, who quite emphatically said, she hates Jews, she would gladly kill Israelis if given the opportunity, innocent or not, anyone suspected of being an Israeli is fair game, a small child ready to strap a bomb to herself, filled with seething hatred. Can you blame the Israelis for erecting that fence? How do you deal with it, human rights, negotiations, apologies, a better future, all become irrelevant in the eyes of a suicide bomber.  In some ways you start to respect someone who is so dedicated to his/her cause, enough to give up the gift of life. However, you have to put it into perspective, children see their parents blowing themselves up for freedom, the struggle, liberation and they are naturally inspired by this, the indoctrination has begun. I mean the message going out there is, if you don't like something or someone, just blow them up and take you with them, not interested in talking or conceding, no respect or consideration. Freedom and liberation cannot be achieved by one or two people blowing themselves up, it can be done by a concerted effort over the years by many, it's a kind of slow wearing down process for the victim, what i don't understand is, say they get this freedom and liberation in years to come, but there is noone left to enjoy it, those who wanted what they fought for the most are dead. Those left behind are few and still filled with hatred, but nothing left to hate, logically they will now have to start wondering if those left broken, battered and scattered by the campaign of their elders, will not strap explosives to themselves, filled with nails and broken glass, tables are now turned, walk into their buses, cafes, bridges and markets, and repay the debts for all the past years in the name of some cause.  I also find this martyrdom process quite selfish, blow yourself up and get to heaven, that's all good and nice for the martyr, but the rest of us down here on planet earth are left to pick up the pieces and deal with the next one. Perceptions are changing all around the world, Arabs around the world are starting to realise that this not a war between Christianity and Islam, it's a war between the civilised world and the uncivilised world. In the last century Afghanistan was one of the focal points of keeping communism at bay, Iraq was also a focal point, but for keeping the Mullahs in Iran at bay. Well we're back there now making another stand against a different enemy, a flawed stand in some ways, but a stand none the less. It's going to be long, it's going to be dirty and a war we cannot lose.

      Paul Kelly The Weekend Australian July 3, 2004  US foreign policy analyst Walter Russell Mead got it best when he told The Washington Post: "You have a feeling that even Bush isn't saying, 'Hey, that was great. Let's do it again."'  If George W. Bush can find an exit strategy with honor, he will seize it. But, would you believe, Bush can't and won't act unilaterally. The reason that has still not penetrated Australia's debate is that the entire Iraq exercise - the transfer of sovereignty, the operation of the US-led multinational force and the timetable for elections and a popular government - has UN authorization. Of course, this endeavors may yet end in more blood, terror and ignominious failure. The strategic arguments against the Iraq war are as valid now (indeed they are more valid) than when it was launched.  But there is a fundamental difference between March 2003 and July 2004. The war did not have UN authorization but the current processes in Iraq do. It is a pity that Australia's debate lacks the moral clarity and intellectual honesty to concede this.   The international community, faced with the consequences of US intervention - a situation that most nations would have preferred never to have happened - passed Security Council resolution 1546 to manage Iraq after Saddam's fall. This is called dealing with the world as it exists. The June 8 resolution, carried 15-0, creates an international agreement on Iraq.  The resolution ended the occupation of Iraq on June 30. It endorsed a sovereign interim Iraqi government. It affirms the right of the Iraqi people to determine their future and for elections before January 31, 2005, to create a transitional government that drafts a permanent constitution leading to a constitutionally elected government by December 31, 2005.  It says the US-led multinational force has the authority to "take all necessary measures" to maintain security. That force operates on the basis of an Iraqi request and it remains only on the basis of Iraqi consent.   Iraq's forces are separate from the multinational force, which assists in their training. The role of the multinational force is to be reviewed within a year and its mandate expires at the end of 2005 anyway.  This represents serious concessions under duress by Bush. The US is acting with the UN and Bush's unilateralism is in hasty retreat.  The Iraqi trauma means that military pre-emption in relation to other states such as Iran or North Korea is a dead letter. There seems one certainty - whether Bush or John Kerry is president, the US will pursue its war on terrorism with more focus and prudence. Realism is breaking into US policy-making, reluctantly, slowly but surely. These outcomes are very good news for Australia.  This doesn't mean that Bush has metamorphosed into Franklin Roosevelt. Bush won't concede defeat in Iraq or the lapse of his doctrine. But the march of history is extracting its own toll. So is the intensity of the intellectual debate under way in the US; witness Francis Fukuyama's frontal assault on Charles Krauthammer as part of his sustained attack on the neo-conservatives' position on Iraq.   Writing in the latest issue of The National Interest, Fukuyama argues that America's war was based on miscalculations and "the fact that our judgment was flawed has created an enormous legitimacy problem for us, one that will hurt our interests for a long time to come". Fukuyama attacks the idea that the US is "custodian of the international system", pointing out that other nations will not accept this.  He calls on the US to be more prudent and realistic in its use of power, returning to the work of diplomacy and coalition-building and becoming more diligent about the task of nation-building.  The UN resolution tries to make the best of a bad situation. It requests member states to "strengthen their efforts to assist the people of Iraq in the reconstruction and development of the Iraqi economy, including by providing international experts and necessary resources through a co-ordinated program of donor assistance".    Full article from the Weekend Australian   My Comments  Many parties around the world are still unwilling to let go of their opposition to the War in Iraq, their original reasoning was supposedly in the best interests of Iraqis, i.e. spare them the pain of war and also the backing of the United Nations. But now that it's over and it's actually July 2004, it is in the best interest of the international community and the Iraqi people that we work together to make it a success, even if it means putting our differences aside. However from what I have read in the media, the pre war opposition camp has changed it's tune from 'no war', now to 'troops out'.  Before I babble on any further, I need to state my position on the issue, I supported the coalition of the willing before the war, I agree that the case for war was shaky at best, the theory of WMD has been shot to pieces by now. At the time though, even the UN were not convinced that there were none in Iraq, so you could hardly blame the Bush Administration for erring on the side of caution. One must understand that if there had been WMD in Iraq and nothing was done about it, the consequences would have been too hard to imagine. None the less I personally could not care less what the reason for going to war was, but that sonofabitch Saddam Hussein needed to pay for what he has done. Like a lot of other despots around the world, he had escaped justice for too long, I like to live in reality and prefer to do something, rather than sit on my hands and pretend nothings going on.  Coming back to the 'troops out' brigade, I am not asking that they change their opposition to the occupation, neither am I propagating that America is some jolly Santa Claus, free of wrong doing and utterly well intentioned. All I have to say is, keep your anti war stance, you don't need to do anything, but don't for one moment call for the immediate withdrawal of the troops, this effectively means Iraq would be worse off than ever before. It would be criminal to throw ones hands up and cry 'too much' and run back home, it would also be a slap in the face of 'best intentions of the Iraqi people'. The UN has effectively given it's blessing for the occupation of Iraq with resolution 1546, and for people to be still calling on the immediate withdrawal of the 'now' multinational force is tantamount to treachery of the very people they were purporting to be fighting for.

      Audi  is releasing it's new A3 model in Australia, the only issue is that the pricing is still undecided. Audi HQ want to increase the price of the new model to one higher than that of the current baseline A3, which is $35K. The BMW 1 Series, which is set to be released in October this year is said to be asking less than $40K for the 118i. This has Audi Australia worried, because no matter how stylish the new A3 is, and it does look better than the 1 series, BMW's brand power and reputation is too much to contend with. With competition fierce in every class of vehicle, Audi cannot afford to give the ever important price advantage to BMW.  However, it gets more interesting, I read an article about the 118i today, link below, the editor was not entirely impressed with the car, lets just say the word count is higher in the 'Dislikes' column than in the 'Likes' column. If this is what the 1 series is going to be like, Audi should not be terribly bothered as time usually determines the popularity of a car.   BMW 1-Series

      Sudan  The situation in the western province of Darfur seems to be improving, atleast on the surface. Yesterday the government in Khartoum pledged to rein in the pro-government Arab militias, who have been accused of ethnic cleansing in Darfur. This militia is largely known by the black African Sudanese as the 'Janjaweed', meaning 'evil men on horse back with guns'. I watched a documentary last night of the situation in the country. The Janjaweed have been accused of mass rape, burning villages, killing the old and very young alike, there are numerous reports from interviews with refugees by the BBC and other media outlets tell of babies and toddlers being thrown into the fires set by the militias. Villages are burnt and those who flee are bombed from the air by government helicopters and attacked by the militia on horseback. It's a sad state of affairs, the documentary last night was almost too much to bear, but we have to see it rather than ignore it.  There is worse, the UN is desperate to supply food aid to the refugees who have had to flee with nothing more than the clothes on their back, there is a looming humanitarian disaster in the region, there are reports from aid workers in the region about surviving mothers having to watch their children die of starvation. The rainy season would have started by now in Darfur, this turns the few country roads in the region into mud and is impassable for the ageing trucks carrying food aid. Contact Worldvision or UNHCR if you would like to make donations or provide help.  As I said earlier the situation is improving, the change in stance by the government in Khartoum is mainly due to pressure from Kofi Annan, secretary general of the UN and Colin Powell, Secretary of State of the United States. They are currently both in Sudan to find some solution for the crisis there. The UN's motives are clearly humanitarian, the Bush administrations are also clearly humanitarian. I have read statements that their motives may be for oil, the tired old knee jerk reaction, it seems like one cannot do Good in the world without someone somewhere with an axe to grind bitching about it. As if the rest of the world, silent and complacent up on the moral high ground, is powering their economies on recycled water.  Hopefully with the international pressure from the UN and Bush Administration the situation in Sudan will improve.

      By PIERS AKERMAN The Daily Telegraph July 1, 2004  DOOMSAYERS and ditherers should concede that the removal and capture of Saddam Hussein is an unmitigated triumph. THE unimaginable is taking place in Iraq with the former dictator Saddam Hussein being brought before a court and charged with war crimes, including the use of weapons of mass destruction against his own people, and the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. This event would not be scheduled if the United Nations Security Council had acted on numerous resolutions it passed over the past 14 years. Indeed, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, Kurds and Kuwaitis would be alive today if the UN had acted at all, not to mention the 60,000 children killed a year as a consequence of Saddam's willful refusal to toe the line drawn by the UN.   Even with the deaths of an estimated 11,000 Iraqi civilians since liberation, more than 40,000 lives which would have otherwise been lost, have been saved. These facts should provide reason enough for celebration, let alone the handover of sovereignty of the nation to the fledgling Iraqi government two days ago, but there are those (notably within the Labor Party) who still believe the coalition should not have liberated Iraq and that Saddam should not be in the dock today, but in one of his palaces. Bearing in mind that those (such as Green candidate Andrew Wilkie and ALP president Carmen Lawrence) who still want to wind the clock back also predicted floods of Iraqi refugees, starvation and malnutrition and the deaths of hundreds of thousands in the war, it's little wonder they now wish to overlook the apparent successes of the intervention.   Those who were opposed to the liberation now sneer that the new government is still reliant upon upwards of 140,000 foreign troops, mainly US, for security. This is absolutely correct, but why should it be a cause for contempt? If Saddam's forces were such when he was in office that the doomsayers believed the war would involve the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives and would inevitably become a Vietnam-like quagmire, isn't it natural that the new government needs some help restoring a sense of civlity after more than three decades of dictatorship, ethnic cleansing, and genocide?   After World War II, occupation forces remained in Germany, Japan and Korea for many years to provide security and support for the new governments. Why should Iraq be any different? In addition, there is the added threat from foreign insurgents determined, for religious reasons, to prevent the installation of a democracy-based government in the Middle East. Among political figures around the world, Opposition Leader Mark Latham is marginalised by his ignorance of the realities of the Iraq theatre. Quisling Spain, which believes it can withdraw from the real world, is hardly a role model for Australia.   Most other European nations, through NATO, have recognised the need to rapidly train an Iraqi defence force to combat insurgents. It is in the global interest for the new Iraq to succeed. The largely Saudi-funded jihadist extremists who have attacked the West in North Africa, the Middle East, Afghanistan and Indonesia, in the past 20 years want to make a stand in Iraq. We cannot afford to lose to them there and see them go on and renew their evil attacks elsewhere around the globe.  This is a most critical time for Iraqis. The cost of their liberation has not been high in comparison with the casualty count in other conflicts. Australians, among others from many nations, are working to deliver real benefits to the people via the rebuilding of the agricultural sector and the provision of clean water to more than 48,000 schoolchildren across northern Iraq. This is not the time for Western nations to cut and run, abandoning the new Iraq government and its people to the extremists working to destroy the new start. After the ravages of Saddam's regime, the Iraqis need time to come to understand and enjoy peace, decency, freedom and their own form of democracy. For them, and those interested in seeing liberty flourish, this is a very moving time. Australians should be proud that their nation has been hands-on in its involvement in Iraq but there is a lot to be done.  Saddam's appearance in court is a small but necessary first step in the right direction.  akermanp@dailytelegraph.com.au

      Saddam Hussein  Death by firing squad, hanged from a crane, life imprisonment with no hope of parole? What should be done about this old despot. Before the war in Iraq, Saddam was an evil dictator, arrogant, power hungry, inhuman and cruel, when they finally flushed him out of his hole he was but a broken man, a dirty rat. I must admit I felt pity for him, but to take pity on this man would dishonor those who suffered under his regime.  Iraqis themselves seem inclined to end his life, atleast the ones that suffered under him, I suppose if Saddam is kept alive, he will remain a beacon for his supporters, a sliver of hope for those who enjoyed the spoils of his dictatorship, and there are supporters for this old man. In many ways ordinary Iraqis may not be able to move on with their lives if Saddam is allowed to live, it would be hard to convince them that as long as he is alive he will not return to torment them once again.  I personally do not support the death penalty as a punishment, but I feel quite strongly that this decision must be left with the people of Iraq, Saddam Hussein must face the people that he ruled over and he must be judged by them. I believe it is an important step in Iraq's history, they must decide for themselves what to do with him, free of outside intervention, much as they must take responsibility for their country and their destiny. The coalition has given them the chance to decide for themselves where they want to go.  They now have the opportunity to confine Saddam and his cronies to the dustbin of history and create a future for their children.

      North Korea is in the process of developing a new missile system for ships or submarines. A companion land-based missile is thought to have been developed already. The systems are based on the now decommissioned Soviet R-27 submarine-launched ballistic missile. The report, published in the authoritative Jane's Defence Weekly, says the land-based system has an estimated range of 2,500km to 4,000km (1,500 miles to 2,500 miles) while the sea-based system is thought to be capable of hitting a target more than 2,500km away.  "These new land and sea-based systems appreciably expand the ballistic missile threat presented by the DPRK [North Korea]," the report said. But the most significant part of the new developments appears to be the sea-based missile, as it could be transported almost anywhere in the world by submarine or ship. Such a system "could finally provide [the North Korean] leadership with something that it has long sought to obtain - the ability to directly threaten the continental US," the report warns.     				  				  N Korea has already proved it has missiles, by publicly testing them
