       It's amazing what you can learn about yourself on the internet.  If you're anything like me, soul-searching is just too painful.  Now, with the wonder of the internet, this pain is completely unnecessary!  Just answer a few easy questions on a few key sites, and the internet will define your place in society for you!  No muss, no fuss.  For example:
 
My sun sign is Aquarius with Libra ascendant.  urlLink www.astro.com  
My Keirsey temperament is iNFp (Healer).  urlLink www.advisorteam.com  
I am a late-wave Gen X'er (Nomad archetype)  urlLink www.fourthturning.com  
I am 45% sexually pure (I will not elaborate)  urlLink www.armory.com/tests/100.html  
and 33% nerd.  urlLink www.armory.com/tests/nerd.html  
I will die on Friday, May 22, 2043.  urlLink www.deathclock.com 
 
Eat your heart out, Jacques Lacan.

       OK, so the Jayhawks fell.  And Duke won.  Sunday was an absolute drag in the realm of sports.  But, on a brighter note, the baseball season is just around the corner.  Despite the efforts of Bud Selig, baseball is still alive.  The Tigers actually used their offseason to improve their team.  I'm not saying they're going to win the division or anything, but they should lose less than 100 games this year -- a marked improvement.

My final four prediction:
Oklahoma State over Connecticut.

Go 'Pokes!

       So somehow I went from just sitting here watching UConn pound Alabama, to creating a blog of very own.  I suppose I have Tiger to blame for that.  Anyway... this being my first official blog, I feel obliged to be clever or insightful or something.  Having failed that, I'm just going to bitch about sports, especially on the east coast.  I'm still wondering why the world needed two hours of pre-game coverage for the UNC-Duke game, quite possibly the most overrated rivalry in all of sports.  That said, is the same sort of hype really necessary or warranted for a PRESEASON meeting between the Red Sox and Yankees?  The Mets' new alternate jerseys (the orange ones) are simply horrendous.  What's next -- double knits and pillbox caps? (Cue Sister Sledge's "We are family" here).

On the other hand, the Jayhawks are still alive (third straight Elite Eight), and I don't want to hear any bitching about how they haven't played anyone in the tournament yet.  KU's still playing, while 200-odd teams are sittin' on their futons watching CBS mutilate yet another year of tournament coverage.  Rock chalk on, boys from Larrytown, rock chalk on.

       With the loads of crap the Hollywood studios seem to be force-feeding us "consumers," I was pleasantly surprised to have seen three very good films in the last week. 
 Film #1:  Big Fish   
I saw this at the local dollar (actually $1.50) theater, and although I'm not a huge fan of Tim Burton, but this one really got me.  Burton tells a wonderful story here about fathers and sons.  The background is quite simple: a young man and his new wife are called from his job in France to see his father, who is terminally ill back home in Alabama.  Sick of his father's "tall tales," he encourages his father to reveal at least a little of his "true self."  His father remains true to his stories, and much of the film is told through the fantastic semi-folkloric tales he has crafted of his youth, played by Ewan McGregor.  Through some minor detective work, the son discovers more truth than fiction in the tales, and finally comes to understand his father as he dies.  I have to admit, the emotion of the death scene was enough to get a tear rolling down my cheek, and thoughts of my own father (who is alive) and his father (who is dead) really affected me. 
 Film #2:  Kill Bill, vol. 2   
Quentin Tarantino really outdoes himself in the conclusion of this two-part film.  Beatrice Kiddo (Uma Thurman) continues her rampaging quest for revenge against her former employer and lover, Bill (David Carradine).  One of the most terrifying scenes I've seen put to film, in which Beatrice is buried alive, is counterpointed with a very amusing flashback of her training at the feet of the American-hating and misogynistic Chinese monk, Pai Mei.  In its entirety, Kill Bill is an extremely fun film to watch.  Kung-fu film clichés are exagerrated into hyperbole, backed up with a great 1970s funk soundtrack. 
 Film #3:  Mulholland Dr.   
I saw this one Monday in my Film Noir class, and was so confused I had to rent it and watch it over again.  David Lynch has created a very difficult film, full of symbolism and contradictory perceptions of reality.  The majority of the film takes place in the dreams of a Hollywood starlet, Diane Selwyn (Naomi Watts).  In this dreamland, where "everything is illusion," we see an idealization of her arrival in LA, and subsequent acting career and relationship with the actress Camille Rhodes (Laura Harring).  Only after she wakes up do we learn the true condition of her life in Hollywood, where she has been repeatedly and publically rejected, not only by the film industry, characterized by the director Adam Kersher (Justin Theroux), but by her lover Camille, and ultimately her parents/grandparents.  She is now portrayed as a broken woman at her wits' end, suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, ultimately self-destructing.  Not a happy film, but a great look at the fallibility of the human spirit. 
See you next time.

       It appears as if I've finally hit my stride in the next stage of my pseudo-intellectual life.  Reading poetry by Jacques Prévert and analyzing it on a structuralist basis.  Hmm.  It was a rather effective analysis, and it did make sense, but am I taking myself too seriously?   Why do I still feel like a fraud?  Perhaps that's the true nature of the intellectual.  If I ever consider myself one [an intellectual], I'll let you know.  That way you (especially you, Tiger) can smack me in my fat head. 

Well, I just watched the Tennessee-LSU women's Final Four game, and I have to say I'm surprised.  I actually enjoyed watching a women's game for once.  While the success of Pat Summitt (TN) and Gino Auriella (CT) has brought exposure to the sport, I think it's really starting to hurt the women's game.  Every freaking year has Tennessee and Connecticut in the Final Four.  Parity has been slow to come.  I'm looking forward to seeing how new KU head coach Bonnie Frederickson does with the lady Jayhawks in the coming years. 

By the way, Mikey-Mike, you were wrong.  I looked it up.  "Née" is pronouced "nay," not "knee."  Also "zee" is indeed a word, meaning either the letter or the letter's shape.  So nyah.  Anyway, it was good seeing you.  Thanks for the many delicious pies.

       Roses AND thorns to Jake for sending me a link to Günther's website, where it is possible to watch the streaming video of this summer's dance hit, "Ding Dong Song."  WTF??!  The very fact that I share my name with this mullet-sporting Swede (who says he "feels European") should be offensive to me, yet somehow I feel a strange swelling of pride that a Günther could create such a song even more inane than Right Said Fred, Chumbawumba and the Spice Girls combined.  Actually they have their charms.

       The results of the April poll are in and the results are: 
Who is your favorite fraggle? (number of votes in parentheses) 
I hate fraggles.  The doozers shall overthrow them in violent revolution: (4) 
Boober.  The buzzkill launderer: (1) 
 
Statistical analysis of these results has revealed that at least five persons have read this blog in the last month.  Or someone voted twice.  I don't know. 
Look for a new poll in the next couple days!

       OK, here's the latest chapter in my love/hate relationship with technology.  As the proud owner of a (relatively) new laptop computer (Dude, I got a Dell), I was overjoyed to learn that through the wonder that is wireless networking, I could access the internet from pretty much anywhere I went.  Hell, even my favorite coffee shop in Ames, Iowa, has wireless 'net. 
Understand my frustration on Thursday, when, after booting up my computer on campus and starting Mozilla (IE can bite me), I was greeted with a bloody red screen saying my access to the ISU network had been blocked by IT, listing several steps I needed to go through in order to restore access.  Nevermind my film was due in three hours.  So, patiently, I went through two separate virus scans, each taking about an hour, telling me I was infected with all manner of viruses, including the flavor-of-the-month, Sasser.  I'm glad I keep paying that subscription to McAfee.  Keep up the good work, boys. 
I'm sick of technology.  I wish I could just expel it from my life, join a commune, read  The Unbearable Lightness of Being  and live the good life.  Why can't I?  Because I love it, like if I keep buying the latest gadgets I'm going to win a prize, or at least make up for every single technological disappointment and alienation I've ever experienced.  I could live happily ever after - no, really, I could.  Oh, that wonderful revolving door of consumerism. 
Actually, I've already read  The Unbearable Lightness of Being .  One month until Europe!
