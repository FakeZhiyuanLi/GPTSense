      Today I set about buying the essential travel necessities that I may need for Africa, I went and had a look at Some first aid kits thought about phoning up about travel insurance and bought a  urlLink Digital Camera .   So you can expect me to start taking loads more pictures and posting them in the album section. Currently I have take a few of my office and nothing too exciting but I am going to a  urlLink caelihi  (please excuse the spelling) tonight so I should have some pictures from that.

      Well I have my visa valid until end January 2005&nbsp; and I have changed my flight details to return on the bank holiday Monday (30th Aug) so no lake district, have to be another time. It is just as well DB is paying for the flights as I keep changing them about all over the place.   I think I may have someone to rent my flat as well so it is all working out nicely.   I think I may make it my ambition to fill my passport with stamps, I have 20 pages left ( however 3 or 4 of them are marked in some way) and it is valid till June 2006. Visas and stamps from Africa should take care of 10 pages, if I make it to Australia, new Zealand that's another 4 (stamps from stop over as well) leaves me 6 pages therfore Japan,Cambodia, Vietnam, Fiji, Singapore and Malaysia, possible but deffinately a chalange.   feel free to leave comments on this page if you want.

      Omens are not good for India I bought a Lonely Planet guide at the weekend and it took me about an Hour just to find the right page for Bangalore, if I can't even find information about Bangalore how am I going to manage to find the place itself, somewhere near the south pacific maybe?

      On thing you may have noticed about me is that there is all ways another plan of action every day I come up with another mission. Sometimes there are re-occurring themes. Climbing, ambulance driving, the environment, and political lobbying&nbsp;seem to be the main themes.   so here is today's plan   come back from traveling at some point, and do a masters probably in some sort of managing environmental policy, I've had a look around and have found a funding agency ( urlLink NERC ) and a potential course  urlLink MA Space Place and politics  at aberystwyth, of course I would have to find some sort of part time job to pass the time but that shouldn't be too difficult.   well that's today's plan call back tomorrow for the next one.

      Went to see the  urlLink Levellers  yesterday, in Oxford town hall, went with my Brother(Mark), Bev (his misses) and his son Karl (5 years old). Strange as it may sound Karl is a big big fan of the levellers and really enjoyed him self, especially to 'Its a beautiful Day'.  I had a great time also and even thought it was an acoustic set they still managed to get enough energy in to quite a subdued crowd, there Irish sounding Folk rock, once again failed to disappoint and I keep to my claim that they are the best Live band I have ever seen.

      Going to be made redundant in November getting a pay off that covers by debt but not much more, just bought a flight To Dar Es Salem in Tanzania.&nbsp; Now I have until November 8th to Do the following.    Find someone to rent my Flat   Get a visa for Tanzania  Find somewhere to store my stuff  find some money  get Travel insurance  decide what I'm taking.   Doesn't seem too bad really, but this is just the first pass and I am sure I have forgotten stuff. Also I have to get a three week trip to India with work in to that space somewhere.  I have lots more to write and I think that the first few entry's in this blog will be fairly hectic but hopfully when I've got you all up to speed I will become a bit more coherent.   Well that's the first post done and dusted, well not quite I was inspired to write blog&nbsp;this by the epic journal of  urlLink Ben Turner  which I recommend.

      Been a bit lax without he update of late but here is an update and if your lucky I may put some pictures on latter. I have decided I have now seen everything Bangalore has to offer, so I am going to  urlLink Mysore  on Friday (The Office is shut RESULT) a little town about 50 miles south of Bangalore which is apparently very photogenic. and then I am going to see the Largest monolithic statue in the world,  urlLink Sravanabelagola  on Saturday. Sunday I finally get to leave Bangalore when I go to  urlLink Mangalore , which I hope is more different in style to Bangalore than it is in name. and then I am away to Delhi for the rest of the time. Shall see what I can see up there.

      I have a lot to write about today it being my first day off   Driver  Got to know my driver pretty well over the past few days, it is quite strange having a driver and I am not quite used to it. I can ask him to take me any where and he does but I feel awkward because he has to get up before me just to be ready to pick me up, and then he stays out with me all day. I end up just telling him I am going back to the hotel just so I can feel a little less restricted and then I sneak out for a look around the city from a ground level perspective. You see you can't wander around backstreets and discover strange little markets from a guided car, but on foot things are different. Today I also got to meet his family and see his house, Very small one roomed ground floor apartment he shares with his wife sister in law and three children for this he pays 1500 Rupees (GBP 20) , a month. It was very nice of him to do that but I think he was trying to hammer home a hint about a tip, but none the less very nice and he does have very well behaved children.   Shops  Just like Thailand the "Gift Emporiums" Employ an incentive scheme to Cab drivers Where by if they Bring a tourist to there shop they Get 5 points when they get 100 points they get 1000 rupees, so if you get a cab or a rickshaw they end up trying to convince you to go to a couple of shops, all of these shops employ the hard sell tactic, I started off along the "Just looking" tack but as the shops where on I discovered the best tactic was to to be harsh on the workmanship whilst being tight as anything.   Tips  Not much to say here but I just wanted to say that it is impossible to know when to give tips and when not to.   Bannergataha national Park  I decided I wanted to see some wildlife so my driver told me about Bannergathar National park which he happily informed me I would see Lions, Tigers, and Elephants, all in the wild. Now I was a little dubious as Lions and tigers do not share the same habitat, but I went along anyway. Turns out that it is nothing more than a Large safari Park, but you did get a lot closer to the animals than you do in the UK. To be honest thePark is a lot bigger but you are not aloud in to the main park for conservation reasons But still it was a bit of a dissapointment, on the "wild" front but still cool on the "oh my god i can feal the bear breathing on me" front. also they had a zoo around which i was guided by a "knowledgeable" guide who knew nothing about the animals kept in the zoo.   Market  Went down to the city Market, lots of meat and vegetables all very cheap but of no use to me as I don't have a kitchen. Also have seen a lot better markets in Slovenia and Thailand. It was worth a trip if only to get away from bangalore high society.   Photos  I am just setting up some new photo albums, the work one will probably only be of interest if you happen to work for DB or TCS but I would recommend the animals and streetlife one.   Luggage  Oh yeah. My luggage finally arrived but not before I got a bit of a scare. The hotel picked up the wrong bag from the airport and happily delivered someone else's bag to my room. When by bag did turn up it was shrink wrapped and looked about half the size, whereby the hotel porter promtly went about hack the wrapping cutting one of the straps in the process.

      Well the end of my first week and still no luggage but I do have a new wardrobe.  I seem to have settled in to the swing of things over here and refer to my Hotel as Home and am off on the daily bangalore commute. Its a bit of a shame I have to do any work but even that is going pretty well now and hopfully it will be viewed as such by DB.  I am off to a national park this weekend, where they apparently have Lions and tigers and elephants, so I should have a great weekend, will report back then.  On the Africa Front things are starting to come together now Cat has said she is coming out for Christmas in cape town, which is really cool. Additionally I have relatives over there who have said we would be very welcome to stay, My Boss has a house in Jo'Burg so we are fine to stay there. And Josie and Mirium (I am never going to be able to spell your name) Know some one in Zanzibar so again accom is well truly done. Need to convince Alex and an to come out as well now.

      First off my bags are still missing and it seems they are still sitting on the runway in London along with  urlLink 7000 other bags . Which is not much use for me however it has enabled me to do a bit of shopping but I don't want to go too crazy in case BA don't settle my claim properly. Also I should have some cover with my works insurance which should be pretty good.  its a shame I have to work out here as I could be having a real ball, the roads are as crazy as you hear about but the weather is not quite the same. Still the work is tiring and I haven't had a chance to see too much what with shopping and work.  I managed to get my self stuck in a lift yesterday which was interesting, the first time I have ever seen a lift overloaded.  The cool thing about being here as a client is that TCS have gone out of there way to welcome me when I got to the building all the receptionists instantly knew who I was and there was a welcome board in the lobby saying "TCS Welcomes Mr Douglas Silverstone Of Deutsche Bank" and they have given me my own private Driver to take me wherever I want to go 24 hours a day so no more getting ripped off by The rickshaw drivers.  Been making the most of the food too already had too many curries but supprisingly my stomach still seems to be holding out. any how when my bags arrive I will post some pictures but until then good night.

      Well I made it all the way to Bangalore unfortunately my baggage did not meaning that I only have one pair of trousers and one t-shirt to keep me going. I Was under the impression that the baggage handlers were on strike for my return flight, however in this situation I don't think it would have made a difference. Incidentally it seemed to be only the business class passengers that have had there bags mislaid, all the commoners where happy as Larry with bags and everything. Now nothing happens in a particularly organised or promt manner in Mumbai so even though I only had a short amount of time before my connection there seemed to be endless administration and you would get walked to a particular point in the airport and then the wee manny would disappear and someone else would come and walk you to a completely different part of the airport, and so it continued until it was to late to check in with baggage so it was just as well BA lost mine so I could go straight on to the Jet airways plane, shakey little turbo Prop. Its kind of a shame because BA business class was really cool especially during take off as you have your back to the pilot and as the front of the plain lifts you sort of just dangle looking down the plane.  Any way had a look around bangalore today seems quite nice and just what I imagined, the rickshaw drivers rip you off at every opportunity but if you argue a bit they normally fall in to line. I Was had by one when I was on the way to the Bull Temple, he stopped at the top of a one way road down which Rickshaws are not aloud and proudly informed me that the Bull temple was "down there on the left" of I dandered to find out I was actually 9km away from the Bull temple.

      Some advixce i recieved from Gary - He went to India last year so i thought i'd put this on here so that i had it to  reference.  Thanks Gary   Elephant ride up to one of the Forts. (Jaipur) Taking a rickshaw ride... anywhere, the life threating experience can be found in any Indian city! Tai Tour (Taking a tour guide is not recommended as a rule for anything in India coz they rip you off but hay it's the Tai and worth it and considering they think ripping someone off is £2.50 what can I say?) Take an auto rickshaw ride (Same experience as a push pedal rickshaw just faster) Go Shopping in Jaipur... well shopping is a 'loose' term here. More like have a group of people following u around begging while you try and not get ripped off by the locals... which brings me to... Barter... they won't respect u otherwise, good tip: Get them to come down in price a bit then decide your not interested in the toy/gift/junk and walk away... they normally half their price and come running after u. Visit one of the Palaces in Jaipur and have lunch/dinner/snack/bottle of wine out on the lawn , especially good in the evening. Try to get to the look out point (one of the old forts in Jaipur) at night and have a beer, the view is amazing and it won't be touristy then, just lots of locals hanging out... be careful getting up their - get a cab and get them to wait - it's a bit of a trek but so worth it. Have Dinner at the Oberoy in Agra (just down the road from the Tai). Perfect way to relax after a hard days site seeing... the full size marble tiger is well cool and the staff are more than willing to take your photo with it! Eat as much of the local food as possible, (does get to you after a while and you need just to go and have chips but there are plenty of places that do european style food). Lots of the Indian food is veggie so should suit... which brings me to... Never ask for a Big Mac... (I know as your veggie you won't) It's not big and it's not clever.... Clubbing (altogether a different experience and like stepping back in time) - 'Steam' in Jaipur should satisfy your needs. It's a riot. Get a open blade razor shave and head massage (make sure they use a new blade for the razor) it's so nice. Finally have fun, it's a bit daunting with everyone trying to get you to buy things or beg off you to begin with but if your strong and ignore it they go away (sounds harsh but in some cities in India it's illegal to GIVE to beggars) Yeah and Have fun, your gonna love it! (Perhaps not the day or two you end up on the bog and can't get any further than two steps away but that doesn't last) Oh and watch out for the camels!

      My trip to India was looking a bit shakey for a while today. it turns out that the guys that I am going out there to teach don't have any access to our systems and my boss gave today as a deadline for there connectivity. and until now it was looking shakey, but now it appears all in place.  haven't organized any cash yet, or packed it seems like there is a lot for me to do but I can't think of much.  really beginning to look forward to India now, I have sorted out a company flat for my weekend in Delhi, and reckon I can do the Taj in one day, Jaipur on another and see the rest of India on the othe Day.  Hopfully the trip will go well and when I come back I should be able to hand over the rest of my stuff with ease and be out of a job by October 1st.

      Had a great weekend, and managed not to lose my digital camera which for me is a good start its really cool and takes pictures and everything, but I did forget my USB Lead so no pictures today, I will put some on tomorrow.  One weekend of summer and I have already had two days of BBQ's almost feel Australian.  also found out that Malawi Only had television introduced in 1999 how weird is that, I mean in the UK we get most of out Input from the outside world from That little flashing box in the corner how strange it seems that A whole culture still exists with out Big Brother. The other thing that is striking about all of the African Countries IM visiting is the average life expectancy is always in the Late 30's. Even in south Africa It is only 45, which sort of implies that I will be seen as a middle aged man there, it just doesn't seem right some how, but at least they don't have to worry about a pension plan.
