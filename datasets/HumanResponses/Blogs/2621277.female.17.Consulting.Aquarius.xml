        THE GREAT TOILET FLOOD OF 2004    Today is a day that all of your grandchildren will ask you about.  "Granny, do you remember the day of the Great Toilet Flood?" they'll ask you, almost too scared to immerse themselves in such terrifying history.   You may be asking yourself, "Why don't   i   know about the Great Toilet Flood of 2004 if I'm supposed to be telling my future grandchildren about it?"  The answer my friends, is blowing in the wind. The answer is blowing in the wind.  I mean, these are the events that passed on the terrible day.  Today, in fact.  So I had been catching up on my "internet surfing time" since i DEFINITELY didn't spend enough time on the computer doing nothing this week.  It was about 5:00 on the evening of Saturday, January 31st.  I still remember what i was wearing.  Pink pajama pants, unfortunately which have turned into high waters, tucked into a black pair of snow boots.  An orange vest for warmth over a blue t-shirt that read "Bridgeway Soccer" on the front and "COURTNEY" on the back.  My hair was pulled into a pony tail, and as my dad said joking around, "was due for an oil change."  Little did I know that that day would change my life.  I traveled downstairs to the basement to start a load of laundry, my sheets i recall.  They were due for a washing after that creep-o mary spent the night. Anyway, As I descended the last half of the stairway, it came to my attention that there was water everywhere.  It had leaked from the bathroom, first taking over the rug in front of the gas fire, then traveling under an oversized filing cabinet, and next making its way to the foot of the stairs.  "DAD!" I screamed, frantically looking for a way to block the steady flow of water, "I need your help with something."  For the next half hour, my father and I fervently worked to sop up the saturated basement. Regardless of our efforts, several lives were lost, millions of dollars of damage was inflicted on the community, and much of the livestock from area farms drowned.   That, my friends, is the Great Toilet Flood of 2004.  The cause of the flood is still unknown, but it seems that the toilet was accidentally left running.  The porcelain toilet bowl continuously filling up with more and more hydrogen and oxygen atoms until surface tension broke, causing waterfalls of cascading toilet water.  This unfortunate cycle would continue until my chance discovery.  I'd like to ask you to keep my basement in your prayers.  There are currently many volunteers rebuilding the community, offering support, and giving monetary donations. I appreciate your support in these trying times.

      a list of my favorite words:  whilst extroidonaire etcetera, etc. and such fangoriously comeuppance  i'll be updating these, as my favoritism for other words in the English language changes constantly!

       urlLink Dictionary.com/extroidonaire   i just found out that i've been spelling "extroidonaire" wrong.  (see above) although, i really like it better the way i've been spelling it.  i mean, when you add the a to make it the "real" spelling, extraordinaire, it goes into that thing that also happens with "extraordinary" where you sometimes want to pronounce the a so it becomes "extra ordinary"  and that's not extraordinary at all.  it's just really, really, extra, normal. therefore, i shall remain "jessica morris, teenage extroidonaire."    consider this equation that mary and i composed at approximately 2 or so in the morning:  Dollar tree is quantity over quality (or quantity divided by quality in mathematic terms) since you can buy EVERYTHING for a dollar but not of high quality, therefore making Dollar Tree undefined since the quality is equal to zero, and it's quite impossible to divde something by nothing.  You see, my blog-reading friends, the Dollar Tree does not truly exist.  It just, is. And being "just, is" is not really a form of existence, is it?  No, it isn't.  We now conclude the reading and hearing of Jessica's precious word.  I'm afraid we must now go our separate ways.  I have to take a shower sometime.

      isn't it amazing how the human body can function on so little sleep? I mean, you sleep for only 8 hours or so (or in my case, last night i got maybe 5 and a half hours of sleep) and you're able to stay awake the rest of the day.  I mean, i think it's cool.    But anyway, Mary spent the night at my house last night.  We had many a serious discussion, with random comical bits strewn about like strawberries in Mexican vanilla ice cream from Amy's ice cream. mmmm. so good!  We discovered that she's a Republican pig and I am (of course, I already knew my political preference) democratic.  I'm definitely a liberal person.  She's pro-life, I'm pro-choice.  It would be a good topic for our debate club team, (yes, it's the debate CLUB TEAM.  i think it needs both.) but it's so cliche.    The details are out for our Chuck E. Cheese birthday party celebration.  If you don't get an invitation....i guess you're not invited.  Sorry, but there's nothing i can do.    Well, my mom is taking me to Winston today to go to lenscrafters and various other locations, and then we're going to hear some irish band....glen road.  cultured stuff; fun fun fun.   Love and other indoor sports, (i read this in a Judy Blume book! hah!) Jesstown

      Today, i was cleaning out some of the hard drive on my computer and i came across the retelling of the events that lead up to the party Mary and I threw at christmas.  Hilarity ensues:  (Imagine this being said in an "absurdly exaggerated southern belle accent")  Jesstown: so my friend mary and i were shopping one day in november whilst scanning over the formal dresses in a store, when i had a light bulb moment. "MARY," i gasped, "why don't we have a formal Christmas party so all of our friends (but most importantly us) can buy pretty dresses to wear!"   "Oh, Jessica! That is the most superb idea i've heard all day!" Mary exclaimed, with almost orgasmic tone in her voice. from that moment until the present date we fervently worked to make this party the party to end all others. The day before Thanksgiving break we gave out invitations reading: "Mary and Jessica's Social Event of the Holiday Season," etc. so we gave out invitations to all of our closest (and select few) friends, and  over the Thanksgiving break, all of our guests begged and pleaded their mothers for permission to attend...and to buy that pretty black satin gown they had been eyeing in their favorite department store but their mothers, who were brimming with common sense, would always say, "OH, darling. That dress IS very pretty, but where will you wear it?" ----------------------- And it goes on from there.  pretty good, eh Steve?  I decided to edit out the part where we tell everyone the party was canceled, then go back and invite them to a completely revamped party.  Oh, and there's the part where Amanda thinks Farah is being mean to her and so she doesn't come....haha.  So today my mom and I went on another of our dysfunctional shopping trips.  Literally every time we go shopping, something "tragic" seems to happen.  Today we were going to go to lenscrafters to get new glasses, when halfway there we discovered they were still sitting on the dining room table. But we still had other errands to run; we took my prom dress to the cleaners, then went to walmart in search of a yoga mat to replace my reebok one, we couldn't find one with a bag and i almost had a panic attack in walmart, so we left and went to Tj Maxx.  luckily for my sanity, there was a gorgeous pink one WITH a bag for cheaper than the reebok one.  After that, it was off to Dillards to return a pair of kick-ass boots (notice i describe all my shoes as being "kick-ass"? i guess it's because they are!) that were too small to get a larger size. Plus, the boots were now on sale, so i got $40 back!  But back to my "panic attack," it was just that there were so many people there, it was crowded, i couldn't find what i wanted, and that particular walmart had an almost institutional feel to it. and i wanted to leave. so i went crazy hurrying up my mom. It doesn't happen ordinarily, but i do generally try to avoid places like walmart.  has anyone else ever had something like this happen?  just wondering. maybe i'll do a case study on panic attacks in walmart and sue them. you know, force them in court to add a few homey touches, some floral curtains here, some chintz overstuffed armchairs, maybe a nice cheerful sage green wall color. i'll see what i can do.    Oh, and STILL no school tomorrow.  THE ROADS ARE ABSOLUTELY FINE! i don't know what the deal is. oh well, who can REALLY complain about a whole week off from school. if only i had known it was coming, i could've planned for it and spent the week a bit more wisely.  So, fat, balding men line up on my left for make outs, and ladies, line up on my right for hi-5s.  (how do you spell high fives? it's one of those things you really should say, not spell.)  Tenderly, I remain jessica morris, teenage debutante.

      has anyone else seen the new Homestarmy desktop background?  i went crazy over it yesterday. oh man, so cool.   ----------------- BREAKING NEWS! DAVIDSON COUNTY SCHOOLS HAVE ONCE AGAIN CALLED OFF SCHOOL. stop THIS IS THE FOURTH DAY IN A ROW. stop ROADS ARE ABSOLUTELY FINE, YET WE'RE NOT IN SCHOOL, WHY? stop LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING ABSOLUTELY NO EASTER BREAK. stop WHO NEEDS TO CELEBRATE JESUS? stop DEFINITELY NOT DAVIDSON COUNTY. stop ---------------- so, there you have it folks, davidson county is officially atheist.  and i always just thought it was gay!  i didn't really mean that.... i just haven't been out of the house on a regular basis, and i think it's starting to get to me.  I did leave today, however.  i had an eye doctor appointment; i was thinkin' it's time for a new pair of glasses.  a new style, you know. and my mom and i rented some movies.  i have to get a yoga mat!  see, mom bought one for me being the wonderfully, exquisitely kind woman she is; unfortunately she chose to buy a dreadfully ugly gray one with "reebok" advertised on it as large as that stupid Haye's Jeweler's billboard currently defacing my backyard.  (it's been there since as long as i can remember, and it's the biggest eye sore! next to my neighbor's house on stilts, that is!).  I told her i couldn't bear to do yoga on that thing. I would feel like i was being endorsed by Reebok to do yoga.  actually, come to think of it, it would be pretty cool to be endorsed by reebok to do yoga.  but i'm not, so that renders the mat pretty not cool.  so, i'm currently stuck with a grutesque symbol of commercialism to do my yoga.  things like that really mess with your state of mind.  well, that's all i've got for now.  tenderly, i remain, jessica morris, teenage extroidonaire.

      sorry about the double posting yesterday. (actually! i've fixed it, so you no longer have to read the same entry 3 times!!!! yay for technology!) I don't know how that happened.  anyway, i wrote a beautiful composition yesterday to post, but the computer conveniently froze and i lost it.  it seems to be happening that way quite frequently. luckily, i saved it so I might let youse guys read some excerpts.  Battle of the Blogs! Who will win? Will it be "Give my regards to broadway, the life and times of Jessica Morris, teenage extroidonaire" or "Sweet dreams are made of THIS," my "friend" Mary's online diary.  I say "friend" only because it has recently come to my attention that mary seems to be taking credit for my "all language is lies" philosophical bit.  I have the journal from English last semester to prove my theory, as well.  Bring it on, Mary.   I have a real issue when I feel like people are infringing upon my theories, postulates, and ideas.  I don't know why, but I have a definite ownership problem.  I'm sure Mary doesn't   really   think she came up with the idea, or that she's attempting to take credit for my mind-boggling postulate, but for some reason it seems to me that I should feel threatened.  Threatened by her secondary intellect? I don't think so, yet I still feel that way. I am trying to pinpoint a reason or a past event to trigger such feelings, not necessarily just at Mary, but at every human being, but it seems there was not a single incident to blame.  It's just how I am, I guess.  I would feel more secure if I got a copywright and patents on everything I do and say.   And the thing is, sometimes I know i'm over reacting or being a bitch, yet it's my personality trait.  To exemplify, I recently remarked in a past blog entry that it was now my life's goal to begin seeing how many petitions I could get people to sign.  The next day upon telling Mary of my idea (and of course I had to tell her! she's one of my only friends who shares my same quirky personality traits!) and requesting her help in my ambition, she immediately began compiling lists of possible petition topics.  and I guess it made me feel threatened, but I didn't say anything.  Perhaps I just realized that it was this personality trait of mine trying to surface, like a diver after allowing nitrogen levels in his blood to decrease slowly before reaching the top, or maybe it was because i'm so damned passive aggressive that I didn't say anything.  Anyway, what I'm trying to convey to my readers/viewers/listeners, is that I was not mad at mary, just angry that the whole world didn't give just ME credit for the idea!  I'm selfish in this respect!  It was the same way when I came up with the idea for the "Book of ____" also another endeavour I asked mary for help on!  So, if anyone in the future ever feels that I am attempting to discredit them, etc. I have created a helpline, or hotline if you will, to cataloge all of these events.  Okay, so I don't have a website or anything set up for comments, as of yet.  I'll get back to you on that!  Again, if anyone in the future ever feels that I am attempting to discredit them, etc. please send an email here:  thajmo@netscape.net     I'll be much obliged.  Oh yeah, my power isn't really out. I'm just stimulating your brain cells.  You see, upon reading the last entry, you should have immediately followed this train of thought.  All aboard!!       Power outtages? That means computers can't be turned on. Which logically allows me to conclude that without power, Jessica would be unable to access el Internet thus yielding it quite impossible to update a silly old blog. There are many more important things than blogs to be updating when there is not power. Also, Jessica would be obsessing over the lost cable.  Do you know what torture it is to be forced to watch The Simpsons on a black and white, 4 inch, antennae powered tv?  I didn't think so.  If you scored 16-20 points on the quiz, you're a genius.  10-15, can I say, summer school remediation?  1-9, I.Q.   You have now completed the JHM.  Please close your test book and keep all papers inside the test book.  Please return any borrowed number 2 pencils to me at this time.  Thank you!  Have a nice evening, youse guys.   Tenderly I remain, Blogger Jasmín.

      No school today due to the 3 inch pileage of snow/sleet mixture.  I'm betting that there won't be school until   at least    Wednesday.  I went sledding with my uncle, cousins, and various people i never fraternize with. I felt a little out of place..but i got over it, i suppose.    So I thought I'd be nice last night and let my cat Arwen sleep inside, meaning, of course, in my room since she's notorious for eating loaves of bread.  I woke up this morning to a nice pile of crap under my desk.  so i kicked her out of my room.  then she apparently got hold of some ham that was sitting on the counter to be made into breakfast.  so she got kicked out of the house.   So today I've cleaned my room, worked on my photo album, "the life and times of jessica morris, teenage extroidonaire."  yep, that's all i've done.  well, i'm gonna go because i just remembered there are candles burning in my room. our power is out.

      So I just got back from the "Culture Club" meeting.  it was an interesting day, although not quite as quirky and spontaneous as one might hope.  It began with me toiling over a hot stove making muffins, honey bran at that, before being told that we were planning on going out for breakfast. but no matter, my muffins still kicked ass. Then we went to Panera for breakfast, drove to Greensboro (named after Nathaniel Greene, colonel in the Continental Army who led the troops against the "lobster backs" at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse.  Although the Continental Army suffered a defeat, the British army took quite a beating and never regained their strength.  The year was 1781.), and found that the art museum we wished to attend would not be open until a few hours later.  so we loitered about until such time.  The theme of the art gallery was poverty, so there were some "interactive" exhibits, although the security guard yelled at me for touching something. And there was no "Please Do Not Touch the Exhibits" sign present.  I felt a little strange after that and wanted to leave. so then we ate lunch at Battleground park, coincidently the site of the previously mentioned battle. fun times.  i guess.  we did a "reenactment" of the battle.  It was quite a moving rendition.  it was Mike, the lonely abandoned hubcap, against The Stick.  I don't remember who won.  Well, my current fan base:  01.  web hits: 02.  that's up by one from last week! some people need to go get an ice cream sandwich.

      So I went with the debate team idea.  I now have a petition and a poster advertising East Davidson's new debate team.  The petition has over 20 signatures.. but now i need to ask permission from the principal if i'm really serious about starting this thing.  And i guess i sort of am.    Today is Mary's birthday!  i think we might hang out later.. maybe go harass anne at her restaurant....we'll see.  We're kind of low on monies, and we need to purchase yoga mats for the new YOGA CLUB! How exciting. East Davidson is on the up and up.  even though we didn't win the quiz bowl...they got beat in the first round.. i didn't even play to give the 4 seniors a chance to play.  Josh came, along with my parents and my grandparents.  I was probably the only person there with my extended family present.  It was nice, but a little conceited looking, since people probably thought i brought them along to be my own personal cheering squad. oh well. it wasn't a big deal.  Tomorrow i get to go to an art gallery with my group of "cultured" friends.  I didn't get to go last week, but the one we're going to tomorrow is closer, and safer i guess, so i'm allowed.    So, my faithful fans, I must bid you adieu for the evening.  Do i even have any faithful fans? I must debate on that subject.

      Well, it's been exactly a week and a day since my last update. Not much going on in JessTown this week.  Quiz bowl is happening, though.  I really don't know why   i'm    on the Quiz Bowl team.  I mean, I do know the main ingredient in Marzipan is almonds, but when it comes to geography, some history, biology, and almost anything else, i'm pretty much lost.  I guess everything I know could be factored into the "Useless Trivia" category.  Like the fact that most of the Munchkin's voices in The Wizard of Oz were overdubbed because most of the actors had horrible accents and voices.  Or that the "tornado" in the same movie was really just a 35 foot nylon stocking.  Oh the wonders of early 20th century technology!   I would write more riveting news of my life, but I have to go create a fake sign-up sheet for a new "Debate Club" Mary and I starting at school.  I mean, talk about a great conversation starter, "Would you like to sign up to create a debate club here at East Davidson? It would really benefit the school, if I could only just have your signature."    I just came up with a new goal in life:  see how many different petitions, charters, etc. I can get people to actually believe are real and sign! Wow, I better get started with that.  It's a great idea for my book, "The Book of _____" as interpreted by Jessica and Mary.   I'll get back to youse guys later and let you know how my list of petitions is going!

      Okay, so no decision making process.  but i did reach a decision.  drum roll, please.....PUBLIC WEBSITE! I only decided that because i really want the fat, balding men demographic to come to my website.  and who wouldn't? those guys are really loyal, and they have great ideas.   Enough of my meaningless rambles.   i'm sick of school and my Mrs. Allen/Mrs. Williamson hybrid teacher Mrs. Bell.  i mean, those teachers are notorious for completely butchering the subject to make it as unbearable as possible.  and chemistry.  i just can't pay attention in there anymore.  maybe it's because it's the last class of the day.  or maybe i'm just tired of chemistry.  who knows.   oh, i had a wonderful idea to use my extra time at school.  I'm creating a book of indespensible advice.  so here it goes: The 11th Commandment:  Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's halibut.  pretty good advice, eh?

      One might think that being stuck inside due to inclement weather would directly relate to the amount of blog postings one posts. And, I suppose it does if we're saying it relates inversely. It was my theory that, the more free time time I had, the more blog postings I would create. Unfortunately my theory did not hold, as, alas! I did not update yesterday. (downcast head) Yes, I apologize for my delay in intellect. Will you ever trust me again?   In order to redeem myself, here was my agenda from the day I let you down, yesterday. Let's see. I think I managed to do nothing for the entire morning and afternoon. I vaguely remember making bread dough and then taking a shower. Around 10 or so I went with my brother and LizBiz the 2nd to a rock and/or roll show. It seems that my other brother's band "The Push-Pull Men" or as I'm told, simply "Push-Pull" these days, were set to perform. That is, my brother and his two friends and their drummer "IBM." They filled their lack of drummer with a laptop. Man, did that guy have rhythm. Quite a fun time.  Today I am simply lounging about in my pajamas, toying with the idea of cleaning up the house for some spending money. It seems my parents have cut me off and no longer give me a regular allowance.   I have just been alerted to the fact that this upcoming week at school is "Spirit Week." Ugh. That means tomorrow is Pajama Day. I usually make it a point not to participate too enthusiastically. I hear Thursday is "Throwback Day (??)" meaning dress up like the 50's, 60's, 70's, or 80's. I might participate. Either that or staple fake $50 bills to my clothes. You know, for 50's day.  I figure this week will be great for getting the evidence I need for my "What's cool in high school" piece.

      A FOOT of snow. A foot. That's 12 inches of frozen precipitation sitting on the landscape of my fiefdom. And here I am. Alone. So alone. No one to play with. No friends that can handle the foot of snow covering their roads to make the trek to my fiefdom and all it has to offer. So I sit, doing the random "internet surfing" or the random "tv watching" and am ultimately disappointed in what technology has to offer. I take the occasional bite of complimentary Godiva truffles I recently acquired. Occasionally a drip of caramel falls onto my chin. I am conflicted. How do I remove this caramel? Do I deftly lick it off? Or can I just leave it, since I'm alone. So alone.  Actually, my dad was here. Though his day was consumed with his mistress, the Shop. Making guitars. Yeah, we all believe that one. And I did "play" outside with my cousin. Gallavanting is more like it.  We threw snowballs at cars driving past on the highway. Now That's What I Call Entertainment 9. (shifty eyes...) Get it? like the "NOW" music CD's that are absolutely terrible. I know what you're thinking, and it's true, i do have quite a way with words.   A senior (or señor if you prefer) in college recently asked me, "So what's cool in high school these days?" My response to this question: "Hmm. Good question." It seems, contrary to what I thought, I am not the epitome of cool in high school. Yeah, I know! I was shocked, too! I seemed to not posses that awareness of what is cool and what isn't that I so desperately needed. At least, that is what high school wants you to think. So, during the next few weeks, I shall examine and cross-examine every high schooler I can get my hands on, and FINALLY! Everyone will know for sure what is cool. It will be a handbook, a pocket guide to life.   Fortuntely for me, I don't need to be "the epitome of cool in high school" to know that I am, truely, one of the coolest people ever. I just want to give everyone else an accurate picture inside the Cool-O-meter of high school, which is why I'm undertaking this long and arduous project. So, if you are a high school student and you posses the knowledge of what's cool, or what isn't, please drop me a lifeline. Or a LifeSaver. Those things are pretty delicious.

      Once again, my educational process has been hindered by a form of precipitation. Snow, that is. Snow, snow, and more snow. Nieve, nieve, y mas nieve, you would say if you spoke Spanish. I hear they're calling for it to snow all through the night until lunchtime tomorrow. That's preposterous! Fortunately for me, I can finally do all of that Eskimo research I've been meaning to do. I mean, I'm quite ignorant on the subject. "Do Eskimoes really kiss like that? How do they build large enough igloos for the community buildings (schools, courthouses, that sort of thing)? Why is most of the American Eskimo population concentrated in Arizona? They're not fit for that kind of weather!" are just a few of the questions that have passed through my mind these last few, wintery days. On my worst days, I even doubt if Eskimoes exist at all. But, like I said, those are on my worst days. On my best days, I wonder if the stereotypical Eskimo is simply a figment of America's desire for a picture-perfect world.  Or perhaps the Eskimoes are simply being exploited for their cultural appeal. Can you imagine how successful a cell phone commercial would be featuring an Eskimo saying, "Can you hear me now? Good." all throughout his escapades in his wintry habitat? Or perhaps ICEcapades through a minty nap, a bat.  You know, the camera would follow him around while he's ice fishing, or perhaps naming a new breed of snow. Or even racing dog sleds. Or perhaps that is already a commercial? I can't remember. And if it's not really one, then maybe it's just subliminal messages being conveyed through commericals for Donald Duck brand orange juice or something.  Woah. I gotta stop. Sometimes even my own outlandish governmental and advertising conspiracies scare me. That, and I've had the theme from the Harry Potter movies stuck in my head. Also, I miss Cary Elwes. What ever happened to that guy?

      Wow. talk about a slow news day. That or a way-behind blogger. Take your pick.   I think you deserve to know what I've been up to, So, the "low-down" or "skinny" of my weekend and week:  Saturday:  More like FUNdue! Great times, great times. JLC concert was great. Of course, there was an overabundance of teenage girls. Teenage girls with their own choreographed moves. (shaking head in disgust.) (further disgust.) Come home, and there is a big, black smudge on my nose from my underage-Xs on my hands. Sunday:  Lunch with the family. Good food ensues. Next on my agenda, tennis with a collegue. Fun times ensue. (i like that word, ensue. (ENSUE copywright JessTown 2004) steal it and i'll SUE you. HAH.) Monday: Nothing of importance. Actually, I can't remember Monday. Tuesday: My first violin lesson in almost a year. It seems as prepared as I am, or not, my teacher always has a way of making me feel ill-prepared, but in a good way I suppose. It's motivating.  Later, I watch the movie Best in Show. Hilarity ensues. Wednesday: Yoga-town. and then I eat really, really good cheesecake. MMMM, purely chocolate. No really, that's what it was called. Oh, and the woman who's substituting for the 2 months or whatever my Chemistry teacher is having her baby (yeah, I know. 2 months is a long time to have a baby.......shifty eyes.....) came to "observe" the class. And I don't like her. Her name is Ms. Weir. That's right. WEIRD minus the D. I just don't know why people set themselves up like that.  Later, I left a menacing note on the board for my friend reading:   "B-ANNE: IF yoU wANT to LIvE, gO to THe END of ThE cHEMiSTRY rOoM ANd aSk FOr BiLlY. HE wILl GIve yOU furTHER inSTRUctIOnS."  Pretty freakin' hilarious if you ask me. "Billy? Billy? BILLY?" she kept asking. Man, sometimes my randomness is just too cool.  This was added to the other threatening letters I put in one "Z's" locker. "DO NOT TOUCH THIS LETTER OR YOU WILL DIE. ANTHRAX. -jar." See, to read the letter he will have had to touch it. thereby infecting him with anthrax. If it were real anthrax. I knew there was something wrong with my plan!! There was one more letter, but it seems my memory isn't what it used to be. Now that I'm getting old(?)  Well, it's seems to come to my attention that there is a new Strong Bad e-mail I seem to have neglected in my past few busy days.  Paper, take me out.

      Well, I'm in a good mood. Fondue AND Jump Little Children all on one night! This much fun should be illegal!  Other than that, not much is going on.  No outlandish philosophies to regale you with, either. My passion for playing the violin has rekindled itself today, however. It's so much fun to play music, any kind of music. There's so much expression you can put in to anything...In fact, I think I'll go practice right now.   So tonight, whilst the rest of you are sitting at home watching TV, maybe scraping the last bits of not-so-melted fondue out of the cold pot, I'll be partying it down at Ziggy's and then in Gboro with my brother-town.  Jealous, aren't you?

      On this new day of a friendship with a certain friend, it seems quite an awakening has taken place. There are no guidelines for this friendship, no "Fourteen Points" we're required to follow to a T, only our dedication to the well-being of the friendship and a certain "3/5's compromise" bind us to our relationship. And wow. I guess it's working.  I find myself facing quite a quandry. It seems that Ben's birthday bash, for the sake of alliteration, is Saturday night. A wonderful event I should feel privileged even to receive an invitation, yet I'm still torn. It seems that my favorite band, Jump Little Children or simply Jump, is having a concert the same night. Fortunately it seems that I shall be able to attend both. So I suppose it's not much of a quandry. Not really much of an interesting entry either. Sorry about that.  Well, until I have more outlandish theories and philosophies,  Jesstown  P.S. there is the theory that President Bush will stage a terrorist attack in the fall to assure his re-election.  I don't think I truely believe that, though.

      Since the entire world seems to be involved, here it is, nationally syndicated in my blog:  MARY AND I AREN'T "FIGHTING" ANYMORE.  At least, as of this afternoon we weren't.  And geeze, people need to learn to not ALWAYS take me seriously.  Sometimes when I'm making fun of something, I don't mean it. I just think it's funny. and, well, what I think is funny other people may not. I know that, but perhaps no one really knows me or understands me, then. But since when has it been impossible for two friends to have a spat without the entire world becoming, or feeling, that they're having to be involved. There is such a thing as neutrality without hostility.  Just look at our noble neighbor to the north, Canada. They've safely avoided conflict since practically the day the country was born.    So, the seams holding together the Iron Curtain have been ripped.  I took the seam-ripper of negotiation to them today.  In some fashion, at least. It was more like an unspoken peace agreement.  And, to anyone feeling torn over the "world war" that took place, just know that it's pretty much over.  I mean, there was maybe some emotional damage inflicted and sarcasm has definitely become my weapon of choice, but that can all be put behind us now. Some of it still depends on the other party involved in the dispute, of course. I like to think of myself as a sort of Woodrow Wilson, proposing a plan of action for our friendship. But if I have the same fate as he did, then they won't get ratified, so wish me luck.  And hopefully, this friendly spat can cease to consume my mind from now on. It was very emotionally straining I must admit.

      In approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes I will truely be 17.  Yep, I can see my "Home Birth Certificate" right now.  Jessica Helen Morris was born to Aaron and Debbie Morris on February 17th at 11:12 p.m. Weight 8 lbs. 2 oz. Length 20 in.  It's not the official birth certificate, but since I was born at home that was the one the midwives filled out.  17 years ago my mom was in labor. Maybe I was partially out, I'm not quite sure how long that part of the delivery takes. Don't really want to know, either.  I received an unexpected and definitely one of the coolest gifts ever today!  A STRONG BAD t-shirt (oh man, so cool) was one of the headlining items.  Quite a pleasant surprise, I must say.  And of course, there were the complimentary calls from family to pass the day away.  Always pleasant.  And the $17 from my grandmother!  All in all, it's been a nice birthday.  Luckily I have the whole year to milk it for all it's worth.  Whatever that means.   Well, all these birthday festivities and excitement have made me tired.  Plus I have a few thank-you notes to write!

      Ah, another birthday party, another amassing of presents. Life is good. I got money, new glasses, a plant, a purse, new artwork for my room!  It's a recruitment poster for the Homestarmy, tediously made by my brother, joshtime.  DO YOU HAS? it asks.  Yes, my friends.  This year I definitely HAS.  So, tomorrow, on the 17th, I'll be 17.  Though, I've never made a huge deal of birthdays.  I mean, sure they're special. but it's not like once i'm 17 I'll instantly be older, wiser, or maybe dumber. Things like that come with gradual change.  Sure, I'll now be able to legally see R rated movies according to US legislation, and that's gotta count for something!  As for the familial birthday celebration, it passed with out a hitch. Other than the fact that my piece of cake had the uncanny resemblance of a breast....  Well, i think I'll take advantage of this two-hour delay and get lots and lots of extra sleep! Don't forget to wish me happy birthday tomorrow!

      Alright, you jerks.  Whilst cleaning out my hard drive AGAIN in an attempt to decide (should my computer need to be completely reformatted leading to the deletion of every megabyte I hold dear.  It's been acting up lately) what I should waste my time saving on random CD's and the occasional, very occasional disk.  Anyway, I came across a display of pure genius.  I didn't even remember writing it. I amaze myself sometimes.  So, here it goes. ---------------- Today is "Put all the monkeys back in the Zoo" day, as well as "Find Jessica a job" day, "Clean Jessica's Room" day, and "Pat a friend on the back" day. Okay, so none of those things are going to be accomplished by me, at least not today... you try coaxing 88 angry monkeys back into their cages in zoos all over the world, and then you won't be so quick to judge... Well anyway, I just thought I would take a few minutes out of my precious time (It is also Save the Featherless Chickens Day and Act Like Superman Day) that I could be saving chickens or helpless citizens of Metropolis to respond to your email and also become Queen of Run-on sentences I think this one is a record for me No punctuation except for one comma and it is therefore National No Punctuation Day and Get on EveryoneÂs Nerves Day and I am going to end this paragraph/sentence right here with this period.  I just wanted to let you know I'm not dead or something, but I have been very busy lately with monkey stuff (they wanted more bananas in their diet so they went on strike, and I happen to be a pro at negotiating treaties with zoo animals).  Let me know if you want to find out more on what happened with the monkeys. it gets pretty gruesome...  I have to go put on my Superwoman pajamas I had when I was like 3 now...Metropolis is calling, but I'll be on vacation from being a superhero tomorrow, but who knows what other emergencies might come up...the giraffes have been threatening us with a boycott of turtlenecks...It could get messy...Yeah, well, I'm going to go now... ------------------- The lucky recipient of this e-mail bosting the archaic display of intelligent rambling, thanks for letting me share. not that I asked your permission...  So, I'll let you know if I find anything else on my hard drive.  With in reason.  (To go on a tangent, I was just spellchecking this wonderful posting, and it wanted to change "Jessica's" to "cheescake." I mean, how do you get cheesecake out of my name?)

      Geeze, i hate high school.  Not the actual school. Just the people and the "drama" they create, and how everyone acts like they're still in Preschool.  It's not Pre-high school you jerks.  Yeah, you know who you are.  Grow up everyone.  (this includes yourself, Jesstown.)  having any friends at all + a complex and higher-order way of thinking = none of your friends understand you and everything gets blown out of proportion.  Insert grinning emoticon here:  _____  No, seriously.  I'm through with friends.  It's what I'm giving up for lent.  Or to pay my rent even.  A three-to-one marny?  I would be so lonely. I have to have friends.  Maybe I just need new ones.    This is what you call "stream of conciousness."    Signing, and singing off.

      Esta es una poema que yo escribí.  (This is a poem that I wrote)  Mantequilla de Cacahuate y Jalea  Que delicioso tu eres, mantequilla de cacahuate y jalea. Como un regalo de los dios, estoy comiendo un pedazo de cielo. ¡Ay! Pero no hay mas.  Yo lloro hasta almuerzo mañana.  And in English for you monolinguistic jerks:  Peanut Butter and Jelly  How delicious you are, peanut butter and jelly. Like a gift from the gods, I'm eating a piece of heaven. But there isn't any more.  I cry until lunch tomorrow. ---------------------- Definitely one of my best works.

      What a fun day! and not because I spent it in the conformist chains of love.  Valentine's Day is definitely an overrated holiday.  As i deftly stated today, the only good thing about it is the day after all of the candy goes on sale! (i really should be enormously overweight by all accounts.)  I've decided that all of my problems in the friendship department orginate from the people i choose as friends' inability to decipher me.  And I'm definitely not helping out the situation at all. I'm as complex as they come--sometimes I don't even understand myself.  Anyway, perhaps my friends don't understand when I'm kidding and when I'm not--when I think I'm being funny by being somewhat derogatory, and when they think i'm being critical because i'm being negative.  I believe that you shouldn't have to explain when you're kidding and when you're not...a person that you're hanging out with should know you well enough (of course, there are exceptions to this) to be judge for themselves.  Take my best friend of practically my entire life:  Annakin Sywalker Leonard.  Anne and I totally understand eachother's humor (as far as I can tell, anyway) and don't usually get into dumb arguments.  At least, none that are Anne's fault.  There was a time in the past when I, okay I don't know what I was thinking, was not as kind to Anne as I should have been.  Hopefully I've redeemed myself though.  I mean, that's what friendships are for.  So, on this, the day of love, please allow me to right my wrongs, America.  Annakin--Sorry for any of the shit I've caused during our marathon friendship.  If there's ever a time when I think I'm too cool for anything that I'm not too cool for, feel free to slap me promptly. We can't ever NOT be friends if only for the sake of all the embarrassing things that would leak out. (Bottoms up!)  Sherry/Mary--Geeze.  I'm not sure what's going on.  Communication problems? Lack of caring? Definitely not the latter. In fact, my mind as of late has been consumed with our little quandry. I can't pinpoint a beginning to this, nor see any feasible ending, however I'm sure one must exist. I think you (and of course I should work on this too...) just need to learn not to really take me seriously. but not all the time.  geeze, if you always thought I was joking I could never talk to you about anything weighty at all. And also, be your own person. I get irate and defensive if I think anyone (and i'm really talking ANYONE) is stealing my way of life. Sure, it may truely be your dream to become a pharmacist, hopefully you didn't just put that down because you adore me (though that might be cool, to be admired that much). I can't stand people that copy me. (anyone remember juli? good person, I just felt like she was always infringing upon my actions and everything=not friends anymore) Hopefully I don't take this to the extreme, but I mean, I need my creative space.   So, I have attempted to right some known wrongs. Seemed to turn into more of a "State of the Friendship" address, however. but really, I'm sorry. for what ever it is. Unless someone blames me for stealing their boyfriend. because I definitely haven't done anything of that sort. I don't think I've ever been on a date.  Fortunately, I don't think that's pathetic at all.  I'm leaps and bounds ahead in maturity than the rest of you jerks. Or most of you. Only 2 more hours until the Valentine's candy is on sale. I have to get ready!   On a side note, I decided a semi-cool band name would be "The Quandries."  I mean, it's sorta cool, right?

      Unfortunately, Sherry did not take heed of my essay "Miss Sherry Mack, Mack, Mack" and things weren't much different today. She still didn't eat lunch with me, but that's okay, really. I understand guys are WAY more important than friends. Always.  I mean, who needs friends when you've got a creepy, ugly guy who "adores" you "forever?" Oh wait. You'll need those friends after the inevitible and eventual falling away of this relationship with the guy you gave up your friends for....  Isn't this the classic situation? I mean, everyone knows it happens, but they never think they'll be the ones who will do it.  The solution:  a HEALTHY balance between the friends....and then the guy.  I think that would solve pretty much all of these problems. But that's just a theoretical solution, i suppose.  I bet it could NEVER work in real life.  On the other hand, something so small as who you sit with at lunch shouldn't even matter. It's a miniscule incident compared with the thousands of other drama-inflicted things that happen everyday! I don't want Sherry to start sitting with me at lunch again just because she feels obliged to because of my powerfully moving essays, because that wouldn't mean she acutually CHOSE to; it's more of a pity-act.  So, when Sherry is good and ready to return to her Friendom which is so tediously being watched over by her good friend Jesstown, I'll be good and ready.  But not before.  Which brings me to another point.  I wish I was the Lord of a fiefdom.  Or the Lord's wife, rather. But I would be the one with the real power since the fiefdom was passed on through generation and generation of my ancestors.  Think of the things you can do with a fiefdom!

      I composed a wonderful work of nonfiction today I think you, the reader, would enjoy.  So here it is:  MISS SHERRY MACK, MACK, MACK..... An eulogy for a departed friend  I have a friend, let's call her Sherry Mack, who for one reason another has vacillated--she's changed. And I don't think I like this new Sherry. When I try to place the blame for this cause of this catharsis Sherry has undergone, I admit I'm hard pressed.  So let's examine the evidence.  As few as two weeks ago, Sherry and I were getting along wonderfully, but then something happened. It seemed as though Sherry was developing sort of a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde complex.  She took on a whole new style (one day she was unfortunately dressed as a taxi cab driver OR and old man...I couldn't decide), soon followed by a completely different demeanor. She seemed more terse and didn't have as much patience with my witty antics.  She began sitting with a new crowd at lunch, taking her whole posse with her.  A direct result of this last development was that the unfortunate Sherry had become unbearingly boy-crazy. (see earlier post) She seemed to desire a matching boyfriend for her "new lifestyle", as a friend of mine remarked.   It seemed Sherry had been sucked into the unfortunate cess pool of the desire for teenage courtship (read "Love or Something Like It," an essay I wrote but have not posted).  It was perhaps this conflagration that was the cause for all of her changes I noticed in the recent past.   There was also one, much more immediate concern of mine.  Something that really annoyed me about Sherry.  (I won't go in much detail) And it had to do with a certain junior scholarship I wanted to apply to, but didn't have a high enough PSAT score to do so, to my personal dismay.  Miss Mack, on the other hand, did have the scores for this and proceeded with the application.  Everything proceeds in a smooth, and unconflicting manner until recently. I think I can suffice it to say that Sherry seems to enjoy holding this over my head.  She has taken to things like complaining to me about the essay she has to go home and write for the application, and even making me hold the application form for her while she was busy doing something else.  So, the last thing didn't really happen, at least not with me doing the holding, but she did give me one of those eye-rolling "I'm sorry...but not really" looks.  Overall, this was not what was REALLY bothering me about Sherry Mack.  I just wanted the old Sherry, the cooler Sherry, the Sherry I actually enjoyed being around.  I don't think I can convince Sherry that her "new life" just isn't cool; I can only hope Sherry realizes her downturn and attempts to reform herself.  Until then, Sherry Mack, rest in peace.   I actually wrote all this in a light hearted, joking manner.  I'm not really going to officially peace out of Sherry Mack's life, I just wanted her to be aware. Well, I have some snow preparation to do.

      i apologize, my loyal fan base, for not keeping you up to date on the emotional roller coaster that is my life.  There hasn't been much to write about. although, today i was thinking about time.  how, everything has already happened, and if it hasn't then you are only really getting to do something for one microsecond before time keeps moving on, or something's going to happen in the future.  Like saying "oh i've been to Disney world."  It's just a memory. something that no longer exists except for in your mind.  does that mean it really exists?   this is one of those deep philosophical things that makes sense to me, but not so much if I try to explain it, kind of like my "all language is lies" bit.   So how's about I regale you with some events that only exist in my mind?  Chuck E Cheese:  I think I can suffice it to say that everyone enjoyed themselves.  While Chuck E. Cheese has lost some of it's retro glory, (it can no longer boast one of those awesome alligator-whacking games, but thankfully it still has skee ball!) it still remains one of those sacred, childhood places that are always fun.  Like sprinklers in the summer time.  The only rift in the evening was that mary and I didn't seem to be "llevarse bien."  which i think means "getting along well" in spanish.  Not that we were fighting or anything, just that we seemed to be on different wavelengths.    Our friendship this past week took a wrong turn in the direction of a cliche, high school girl kind of thing.  One of those types of friendships that consists of "OMG! he actually LOOKED at me today! Be happy for me!"  and I guess this is partially my fault, but at least i took the iniative to end it's descent into the frontier "where jessica has never gone before."  and let's hope that i NEVER become one of those girls.  So, mary, become "boy crazy," for lack of a better cliche (does anyone else think the word "cliche" is becoming cliche?), if you want, but please don't drag me down with you.  I'm not that kind of person.    and now, on a lighter note:  I have become my dad's unofficial secretary of sorts.  I make online purchases for him, go through his receipts, etc. Yesterday I placed an order, and while filling out the billing and shipping information, I thought it would be funny to make his company name "Morris Freakin' Music."  Unfortunately, it wasn't funny to him.  I don't know why, but he just didn't enjoy it. so he made me email the company and try to change it.  here is an excerpt:  (written from his point of view.  I wanted to make it feel less like a young child being forced to apologize for something i didn't feel was wrong.  wait, isn't that what happened anyway?)   I placed an order yesterday, or rather, I had my daughter make the order.  In an act of comedic defiance, she thought it would be funny, and harmless, to make my company name "Morris Freakin' Music."  Unfortunately, that is not my company name (I do not have a company name at all), and if at all possible I wish it to be removed from the shipping and billing addresses so as to not confuse the database at Stew-Mac, etc. All other information in the billing and shipping categories is correct, and I would greatly appreciate it if my "company name" can be changed.  well, i'm outtie.  I have to decide if anyone says that anymore, as well.  Oh, and don't forget, National Skirt Day is Feb. 12th.  Though it may get moved back due to inclement weather.

      today has been interesting i suppose.  i've been really really tired the past few days, due to sleep deprivation.  (this isn't the reason for my lack of sleep, but i once read in a magazine from 1999 or so, that dianne sawyer is so "fresh" even at 5:30 in the morning for her news anchorwoman job because of sleep deprivation.  the theory is that while you sleep the water in your body levels out, and your face gets puffy from it. so less sleep the better, right?  hmm....i don't think so. not when you think of all the money she has to spend on concealor for those under-eye circles the size of silver dollars.  or gray dollars, i suppose.)  Anywhoo, i'm a bit stressed out as well because of the chuck e. cheese party.  I mean, no pressure right? it's not at my house, i'm not having to clean or anything. but i got to thinking today, what happens if we go (we haven't reserved it or anything) and there are no empty tables for such a huge party, or something else happens and it doesn't work out. anyway, i guess it's not a huge deal, but i will feel partly responsible for anything that does go wrong.   Mark your calendars.  February 12th is National Skirt Day.  Yes, a day where every female who wants to protest restrictive legware proudly wears a skirt.

      So i've been finalizing plans for the Chuck E. Cheese birthday party.  I'm really looking forward to it, although the main schematics have yet to be ironed out...such as transportation and monetary values.  Things usually work out on their own, if we just leave 'em be.  What happened during the War of 1812?  I'm not really that sure myself.  I think it was mostly about trade with Britain.  I guess I should study.  I think I should make these postings less about my days, and more about my philosophies.    So here it goes:  If women have ovaries, does anyone have underies?  just a thought, Jesstown

      today i held all of the guest passes for prom ransom for "one millions dollars."  unfortunately, I didn't receive my "one millions dollars bill" and I eventually returned the guest passes since my conscience usually gets the better of me in most of these situations.   my creative ideas have stopped coming for the "Book of ____."  pretty much for everything else as well, except for the Kazoo Choir and various other petitions.  and i don't even know if the kazoo choir was my idea or mary's...our ideas so closely correlate these days.  and i think i'm developing some sort of mild ADHD.  the past two days that i've noticed, i've gotten to a point where EVERYTHING is funny and i just can't stay still.  I don't REALLY think it's adhd or anything, just some sort of energy burst.  Maybe someone is putting sanka in my orange juice.    -jesstown

(sounds of glass breaking as lamp is thrown out the window) Homer:  Night, Marge.  This has to be one of the funniest simpson's episodes ever.

      all i have to say is, the PSAT and I are WAY over.  I mean, we're through.  Over with.  Completely finished.    I was quite disappointed in my scholastic acheivement today.  Yes, I, the Great Jessica Morris, teenage extroidonaire, etc.  was thouroughly disgusted when I learned my PSAT score was barely higher than what I made on the REAL SAT in 7TH GRADE! That's right everyone, Jessica must be losing a lot of brain cells.  I had hoped, nay, I expected to make at least a 1200 (conveniently, this was also the score of which I needed to make at least so I could apply for a junior scholarship to Elon), but, are you ready for this America?  I only made 1160 on it.  A measely 40 points away from the minimum I hoped to achieve.  The only thing I can think of is that I either goofed off that day, or they confused me with "Morgan, Amber" the stupid girl who comes before me in the alphabet.  Let's just say I was disappointed.   My class rank, while still remaining in the top 5, has also moved down.  I thought for sure my high scholastic acheivement of last semester would have bumped me up to 2nd or 3rd.  But then, I guess I can't really complain. I mean, I am 5th out of 191 people. And I did have 3 normal weighted classes.  No honors, and just one AP class.  I mean, I'm not really that upset, so it must not be my fate...  I wish i could say i watched the super bowl....oh wait! no i don't! and I didn't watch it! not even half time, though people say I would've been rewarded had I stuck around for the finale.  My dad said that his friend saw a homemade sign advertising a Super Bowl party but they had misspelled Super Bowl making the sign read "Super Bowel."  I definitely wouldn't have eaten ANY of the food that host served!  Well, i'm absolutely beat from my disheartening day.  I'll keep you, my loyal fans, updated!  You'll get your comeuppance!

      I've come to the horrifying conclusion that I'm just like everyone else. To draw from the popular rock song, "I just want somebody to love..." and I think it pretty much goes on like that for the rest of the song. Is it so terrible to need to be needed? I guess I'm finally a stereotypical teenage girl, desparate for someone to love them. Oh my. Not that I've become desparate, but I think that was what my subconcious was trying to say...I wasn't in tune with that side of myself. Those damned recurring dreams. Last night's dream was pretty much along the same lines except Elijah Wood was in it. And we were running around some really cool old mansion with secret rooms. And Elijah Wood worked at a grocery store.   I'm starting a Kazoo Choir. Or at least, a petition for one. And when someone signs the petition they're going to get a free kazoo!! And who knows! Maybe I'll even hold meetings for this phony club. How about 11:50 in the Picnic area, 2nd lunch? Deal. It is the great prelude to the crotch depth seminar.  It really saddens me that 9 out of 10 people in the world will suffer from crotch depth and they don't even know what it is...Damned possums.  So, this is what I'm looking forward to for April:  My "Teen Mystery Party" which will be held sometime-the details are still sketchy, the Kazoo Choir, the eradication of Crotch Depth, further planning of my life-size game of Clue (It's going to be the coolest thing ever!), the end of cold, cold weather, oh, and my impending trip to Albuquerque! I'm leaving on the 8th, I believe! AWE-SOME!

      Oh, i forgot.  So I was a-walkin' down the hall after school today when I see my baldheaded, creepy English teacher fast approaching from the other end. I frantically try and think up some plan so I can avoid the inevitable "Hello" since I am not particuarly fond of this fellow. Anyway, I decide on the quick throat-clearing cough. This allows the Avoider an excuse for both looking down and being occupied at the moment of recognition.  And apparently he was doing the same thing, for at the time of contact, I coughed, then I looked up as he passed and saw him doing the same fake cough thing too! Oh, it was definitely a fake throat-clearing cough. It was the funniest thing that ever happened concerning creepy Señor Cardgage, as I like to call him.   May I just suggest everyone find an alternate for the fake cough thing. I mean, I didn't know it was used widespreadly used!

      Well, my mom is back from Seattle. My present: new penny whistles!  I have realized that I am a spoiled and selfish person. But allow me to clarify. I'm spoiled because, when it comes to friends, I have grown up surrounded by my two awesome brothers. They have kindly let me hang out with them for all of my concious life, helping to form me into the wonderful person I am, but in doing so have set me up for a lifetime of disappointment. I've matured beyond my years and constantly have to remind myself that I can't always expect my friends to be on quite the same level as me. Not that I'm saying my friends let me down. Or that I'm on some higher, unattainable level. I'm just spoiled. And I'm selfish because I try to keep some things, such as my passion for Jump Little Children, all to my self. Is it that I don't think other people my age can appreciate them as much as I think they should be appreciated? I'm not really sure...Anyway, those are the ONLY ways in which I am spoiled and selfish. The rest of my character traits are pristine!  I wish I had more time to elaborate, but it's time for the homework that has been pushed back until the last possible moment.

      I hate bladders and the subconscious mind. Geeze. I was rudely awaken after a mere 6 hours of sleep this morning. Thanks a lot, guys. And it's impossible for me to go back to sleep unless my room is completely dark, and it didn't help that I couldn't shut up my mind.  Anyway. I went to Greensboro with Mary yesterday, then rendezvoused with my brother after I was officially scared by the hardcore FBLAers. Then, along with the previously mentioned elizagerth, we went to see Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I really liked the movie. Elijah Wood's character (Patrick) is a creep though.   [Patrick and Stan are discussing Patrick's new relationship with Clementine, whose memory they had erased the week before] Patrick: Well, when we were doing her last week, I fell in love with her. Stan: You fell in love with her? She was unconscious. Patrick: Yeah, but she looked so beautiful... I stole her panties as well. Stan: You what? Patrick: Her panties. Well, I mean, they're not... I mean, they were clean and everything.  [courtesy of www.imdb.com] See? What did I tell you.  So then, as we were exiting the theater to either the RIGHT or the LEFT, we came across 50 First Dates which happened to be starting in 5 minutes. And that was how I saw 2 movies in one day, for one price, both about memory loss. Absolutely mind boggling. Later, I was going to catch a ride back to Tville with Mary, whose multimedia presentation had just won first place in the state [I think a "compulations" is in order.], and I did. But I was also coerced into going with them to Waffle House to "celebrate."   And that's pretty much how it went down. Though I have left out my recurring dreams. Well, not recurring exactly. But just the same character seems to appear in each night's subconscious movie. It's partially perplexing because I usually never remember dreams. And there's the never ending struggle to decipher exactly what the dream is trying to say. I give up.

So, it looks like I'll be spending my evening in Gtown. First at an FBLA conference (shortly. I'm just passing through...), then with my brother and elizagerth [compulations, by the way].

      Tragedy struck today at the Blood Drive when one student, a junior at East Davidson, fell UP the stairs resulting in cosmetically tragic accident. She hit her head on a step just above the brow, causing massive blood loss. The student was rushed to the hospital where she was stiched up, then admitted so that her teetering blood sugar level could be monitored. It seems that it was her blood sugar level which caused her to black out at the foot of the stairs.  Anyway, this wasn't me as you might be thinking. And yes, I do occasionally speak about myself in 3rd person but not today, my friends. This is just what I had to deal with this morning while volunteering my services to help with the Blood Drive this morning. By the end of the day, someone told me that she fell from the top of the stairs and then was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. This is wrong in so many ways. Our loving principal actually drove the unfortunate student to the hospital.   Okay, it may not be that interesting to youse guys. So, moving on. Oh wait, that's all I've got.   It may be time soon for another National Skirt Day. I'll keep you updated.

      I got an interesting piece of mail today. Shall I tell you what it says? Why yes, I think I shall. --------------------------- Dear Jessica:  It is with a great deal of pride and pleasure that I inform you of your acceptance to the Governor's School West in the area of Natural Science.  Not only is this an accomplishment for you, it is also an honor for the Davidson County Schools.  I hope you have the very best experience possible during your stay at the Governor's School this summer. We wish you the very best.  Respectfully, Fred L. Mock Superintendent ----------------------------- So, all those tense months of waiting for my acceptance, and bam! I got it today! I'm ecstatic right now, I must admit. I mean, Governor's School opens up all kinds of doors for your scholastic future so I've really got a "shoe-in" as they say.  I have been up since 5:00 this morning. Well, actually 5:08...I hit the snooze button twice. Anyway, the MF family was on the news again this morning, only this time it was on WFMY2. Just like I predicted. Tonight we're playing at a bar on the Wake campus. So, it will be a very long day. But, I'm looking forward to it!  Awight, homework time.

      JTown is such a busy girl! Friday night MB and B-ANNE and I went to visit our infamous and dearly beloved Chemistry teacher and her new baby. fun times...then we ate and saw "50 First Dates" which was hilarious. Though, I think part of the hilarity was just that whenever one of us is laughing, the rest of us start laughing and then the other people are laughing at the one person's laughing...so it just kind of gets out of control. I mean, after the movie we were all peeing and STILL laughing in the bathroom. I'm not sure if I should hang out with them anymore...hah!  Yesterday was the Irish festival at WFU that we played at. For some reason there was no power, or rather when there was power it was flickering on and off, so we had to play accoustically. It was interesting. I heard a rumor that there were about 2,000 people there throughout the day. Then the MF family went out to eat with some friends; I later went home with the friends (my brother's friend from high school and her husband, just in case you were wondering) and we watched Santa Claus 2. Oh, and we also watched "The Evil Dog, the Really Mean Lizards, and the Deadly Butterflies" which was an independent film I co-produced and directed and starred in with the previously mentioned girl about 5 years ago. It was so funny! I think that a sequel is in the works, but I'm not going to give away any of the details...  Well I have to write a travel brochure in Spanish, for Spanish for Spain. ¡Que lastima!

      My 15 minutes of fame....hah. It was a very interesting experience, being on tv. We were actually in the tv studio and it was quite bizarre to watch everything happening. There was one embarrassing part, but I'm sure I've made it out in my mind to be worse than it was. Shall I explain?   It seems, due to the lack of ample performing space, my mom and I accidently hit our instruments together, and at the exact same time the camera was doing a close up of me. So you got to see my reaction and the way i was yelling at my mom through my eyes. I mean, I thought it was funny. But we got to meet Roy Ackland and Cindy Farmer and everyone like that. Fun times.   Well, I guess I should go to school sometime today. I'm looking forward to the Kovalent Killas outing tonight.

      To my delight, it has come to my attention (though I had heard the rumors before, I just wrote them off to not be important) that the MF family, my family, will be on the local morning news advertising for the St. Patrick's Day festival we're playing at this weekend. This is especially good news for me since the television spot will get me out of at least 1st and 2nd periods tomorrow. And I have a test in both. Hah! Such good luck, I suppose. Also tomorrow I'm going to go see Mrs. D who just had her baby! Fun times. I miss that woman...It's been 3 whole days!  Today was another fun day, I might add. There was a motivational assembly this morning through which I incessantly popped one jelly bean in my mouth after another; anyway, the assembly ended with the ENTIRE school standing on the bleachers singing "Lean on Me." How bizarre! I just died laughing, the situation was so hilarious to me, and I couldn't control myself and laughed most of the way through the song. Another highlight, "WHERE'S MY SOLUTION SHEET!!?? I CAN'T FIND IT! SOMEONE STOLE IT!!!" which B-ANNE went beserk screaming at the end of chemistry. MB and I had no idea what a solution sheet was...though I can't imagine many people outside of the Kovalent Killas would find this funny at all. The motto of the Kovalent Killas: "Cus we cooperate whilst we eliminate."  So clever, I must say. I mean, I did coin it and everything...  Okay, so watch Fox 8 to see the MF family and yours truly perform live, then check us out at WFU on Saturday.   [There's my self-promotion for the day! Coming tomorrow: JMo sub Fo's REAL IQ! It will blow your mind!]

      The past few days have been...interesting. Were I to give you a brief recap, it would include the odd romance novel, an unexpected dinner guest, and laughter--the laughter is key.   It seems my name was on some sort of mailing list and sometime ago I was the unfortunate recipient of a free teen romance novel. Complete garbage is what I think of those things. Anyway, fast forward to the present and my friend MB gets hold of it. One day in Advanced Mathematical Explorations, she pulls out the book presumably showing off the fact that she is "mature" enough to read such filth. Hah! (Nobody take this too seriously...) Enter one young gentlemen named M@. Upon seeing the book, entitled "The Fall of Maggie Brown" he began to read outloud, conveniently homing in straight to the "juicy" parts. Hilarity ensued, I must admit. Mainly due to the fact that it's not every day you're reading about sex in a math class. Sometimes you forget I'm still a giggly teenager.   Anyway, the romance novel plays an important part in the next chapter of this story. Upon full realization of the utter filth this book was, MB and I, along with our friend B-ANNE decided to destroy it. So, B-ANNE ripped the book right down the middle and went on some sort of mad spree destroying every page. It was like an old puritan housewife burning hethonistic literature. Many brain waves later, she had the idea of tearing out the remaining pages and putting them on people's windshields like flyers. The end of the day arrived, afternoon announcements were over, and we were set. Complete with gloves to hinder the discovery of our identities, we raced out to the parking lot and set about on our mission to advertise romantic literature. Oh man. Sooo good.  And the unexpected dinner guest arrived in the form of the movie "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?" that I saw last night. It really made me think. I mean, who is coming to dinner?

And I got these cute little bunny ears for the baby! ¡Que precioso! Awight, I've got some 'splainin' to do. And I gotta go place.   More later, I suppose.  [Hmm...I don't know.

      Surprisingly I enjoyed the dance, and I stayed for longer than my mandatory 30 minutes. When my "main squeeze" and I got there, no one was dancing. NO ONE. It was like I had been transported back a few years to middle school. So, when Fkat and D-la (I've chosen to shorten their names to keep their identities secret...) arrived a bit later, the four of us got the party started by dancing crazily in the middle. Most of the credit I guess could go to Dla and FKat, but I was still proud of myself.

You guessed it. the computer froze and I was forced to start from scratch. Actually, I love computers (perhaps love is too strong of a word) and couldn't live without them.   In other news, I am being forced against my will to attend the school dance tonight. Something about "my duty to the legislative body of my school." I mean, I am the treasurer of the junior class. so, that's pretty important. My entire weekend is really pretty busy between that and the mandatory hanging out with my friend MB connected to da M and a few other things I won't bore you with. So, I've got a lot of important lines to stand in. sigh....  I wish there was some way other than writing "sigh..." to get across the actual letting out of air.

      It seems that spring just fast-forwarded straight to summer. I mean, it was such a pleasant day today. The pleasantness was so beckoning that my friend and I, with whom i'm liable to end up labeling "best friends!" I know, quite a step! Anyway, back to the anecdote....we just HAD to get outside. So, we took our frustration to the tennis courts where it ended in a draw- 3 to 3 and the overwhelming conclusion that we are out of shape. Good to know.  I also had a revelation. My new career choice is to go into the textile industry. Either the chemistry development part of it, or perhaps even some sort of a design career. The possiblities are endless! Does this mean JTown is putting research pharmacy on the wayside? On the backburner to simmer? Not quite, my concerned friends. I am just expanding my horizons by exploring new career paths.  Anyway, I have the Civil War to study, and about 8 hours of sleep to obtain. I bid you all a fond farewell.

      Another day, another dollar. Too bad I don't actually work for my livelihood and I don't truely respect that saying. But, whatever blows your dress up.  In other news, my previously mentioned survey is not going quite as planned. So far, all I've unearthed is that "Nothing is cool, and we're all frozen under."  I'm not sure exactly what it means, but it definitely sounds menacing. I for one do not want to be frozen under. Unless it was a giant popsicle that I got to eat myself out of. Mmmm...popsicle. Actually, eating your way out of a popsicle would eventually get pretty gross, too. So, scratch that. ----------------------------- I wrote this today: It seems that in high school it's cool not to take surveys seriously. With the precedent laid down by one Ms. Leonard combined with the wane in personal interest of one Ms. Morris, I have uncovered that basically nothing is cool and we're all frozen under. While it is a very interesting theory, I cannot help but doubt that there have to be some cool things in the world. I wanted this to be more of an individual thing--what makes the individual person happy. I would have imagined something like this:  "So what's cool, eh? Well, alligators, pencil sharpeners, wool coats, flipflops..." Etcetera. Not that I didnt' enjoy the interesting quotes that I got.   So, should I abandon this endeavour? Pull up on some secondary road and throw it out of my car like a stray animal? Or shall I throw caution to the winds and go full steam ahead with the idea?   I admit that I'm conflicted. Perhaps when I embarked on this idea I was simply harboring the motive of analyzing my own inner self in the endless search for coolness. Whatever the reason, I am at a crossroads. Either that or I'm frozen under. -----------------------------------

      Those beautiful shoes will be mine! In 6-10 business days. That's right, I am now the proud, at least in the distant future, owner of a pair of pink, polka dotted lace up sneakers. I get tired of everyone else having the trendy stuff when everything I own is just everyday blah. Though I've recently begun to acquire things of classic taste; kick-ass black leather high heels, a satin gown, black full length arm gloves (what are they really called??), classically shaped sunglasses--that sort of thing. That sort of classic-Hollywood-esque fashion. Some might even say Audrey Hepburnish.  I found this list today, of possible names for my cat that I wrote last fall when we got her: Marcy Lennox Ophilia Pheobe Penelope Audrey Arwen  As you may know, I settled on the last. I have quite an affinity for The Lord of the Rings, not to mention the humanity, though she was an elf, Liv Tyler brought to the role.  Alright, I need to sleep. Oh, I fixed the posting times, so they are all in EST now. Yay for technological blogs.

      My blog updates have been few and far between as of late. My apologies. I don't think anything of importance has been happening, though.   Today I discovered 3 kittens on my porch along with what I can only assume was their bedraggled mother. The same "mother" cat greeted me on the same porch early (very early) on Sunday morning when I was coming home from Mary's house. It is deathly skinny and has these horrible eyes that make you sick with pity and disgust at the same time. Anydangway, I chased that cat off with a broom. Later Sunday, after having rested and showered, I discovered that the ghostly white cat was back! It was sitting on MY cat's porch like it owned the place. So I locked it on there and called my dad. He supposedly "took care of it" but nothing permanent since it was back today. And the three little kittens are so adorable but I haven't touched them or approached them for fear of contracting some horrible disease. But then, all kittens are adorable so I should be careful not to get too attached, because inevitably something will happen and they will leave my life like yesterday's garbage...  Prom is fast approaching, and it seems all of my plans seemed to have unfolded in a favorable light. Elaborate more later? I think I shall. Good night, youse guys.

      I just returned from the Beta club banquet where we celebrated radioactive decay in the form of Beta particle emissions. Just kidding, though that would have been cool...and hazardous to our health. No, the Beta Club is really just all about how smart I am. And other people, too. My little Kovalent Killa B-Anne is all grown up and now the reporter on the Executive board of Beta Club! I'm so proud.   Anydangway, I spent last night, like every Friday or Saturday night here as of late, with my brother and we played video games among other funtime things. And today I got a "makeover" from my mom's friend who is a makeup artist. I must say that I did look much hotter than normal. I think this evening Mary, Breanne, and I are going to go pull a number at a local grocery store, a la I Am the Cheese from freshman English class. Fun times. I'll let you know how it goes...  I have a sock on my head? Get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off...

      Shh! Don't tell anyone, but I'm making use of East Davidson's computers to update this secret blog. It was my objective to be completed by 1600 hours. Or whatever. Anyway, my computer a mi casa is currently in a hopefully temporary state of disrepair. It won't even come on. So, it's been since last Friday I'm told since yours truly has been able to update her very newsworthy blog. What's been going on in my busy, busy life you may be asking yourself? Fortunately for you, I've been able to sneak Jessica's daily planner right out from under her nose and sent it hear through a spy network established in Luxembourg...  Saturday: The Croquet party disaster. I mean, i had fun but it didn't really happen like planned. No one showed up except for that weirdo Farah (did I even invite her? hah!) but she was drowsy from taking benadryl and wasn't much fun. So Mary and I ended up playing croquet by ourselves and then we watched Final Destination 2. "If I come out and he's used the laughing gas and my pants are unzipped, we aren't paying." (that last quote was actually from today.) Later, my brother and I headed to Gtown for some errands; I returned a shirt, he bought running shoes, we went to Best Buy, I bought him another controller for his birthday (though it's really for me...now we can play ROTK cooperatively!!), we went to shady Ace's Basement to hear my other brother's band, Push Pull (Men) perform, then left and played video games until the wee hours of the morning.   Sunday: Finished the randomn homework, cleaned my room, etc. Mourned for the broken computer. Monday: School, and, I can't remember anything, so nothing important must have happened.   For now, I must retreat, for my father has been alerted of my presence. The enemy is on my trail!

      Well, nothing seems to be working out exactly right for Jesstown this evening. Nothing big, just everything I hurridly planned and put together has collapsed like morals in today's society.   And I miss Alison Krauss. When I say I miss these people, like Cary Elwes and Alison Krauss, I really just mean I haven't personally seen or heard anything about them in a while. So, when I missed Cary Elwes I watched The Princess Bride for the millionth time, and now that I miss Alison Krauss I'll probably just go pull out my Alison Krauss "Baby Now That I Found You Collection" CD and listen to my heart's content.   Also, there is the looming problem of prom. Do I brave the elements and go by myself? Force myself onto some other friend's group of friends? Sit at home by myself in my prepurchased dress looking oh-so-gorgeous while everyone else is partying it down with creepy prom dates? I have a week to decide. And it will be a tough decision to make.  Tomorrow is the Croquet Tournament. Am I prepared? Absolutely not. Since none of my plans worked out, I just layed around for 3 hours feeling sorry for myself; I'm over it now, but since I wasted 3 hours tomorrow morning is going to be a very busy one. I have dainty tea cakes to make, cheese cubes to arrange decoratively, and the countless other tasks that accompany such an event.   However, I am content in that I got a brief glimpse of Mrs. Davis this afternoon!!! I have missed that woman!

      Put that freakin' sandwich down!  Man, I'm currently stressing out. My grades are falling (I made a 30 something on a quiz today), I can't remember if I turned in my chemistry assignment or if I misplaced it, and that's about it. But still! Oh, I found my toothbrush. It was in my new lunchbox, my retro "bathing beauties" one that I bought while in Albuturkey. So good. Oh, i forgot. I'm hosting a croquet tournament Saturday and I'm NOT PREPARED in the least. Ugh....  Anyway, i need to go place....

      I misplaced my toothbrush during my recent trek to the blessed state of what is now called "New Mexico" and I have been using what I can only assume is my brother's toothbrush. It's pink. Of course, so was mine...rest in peace. However, I'm sure it's lifespan of 3 months had already come and gone, so perhaps Providence is just intervening before my $5000 mouth takes a dramatic decline. It's those crazy braces, I tell you.

       Okay, so I kind of freaked out there at the end of the week and couldn't bring myself to post in my web journal. The pressure of all you people on the internet reading my inner thoughts got to be too much. So I locked myself in the pantry and revealed my secrets to fruit roll-ups and economy sized cans of Heinz ketchup. That worked for a while until I realized 4 days had passed and I'd gained 45 pounds. But now I'm back. Here I am, internet. Rock me like an e-Hurricane.  Actually, that was copied and pasted from Strong Sad's weblog, with a few minor changes. And actually I didn't spend my Easter weekend in the pantry with economy sized cans of Heinz ketchup, either. As you may know, I embarked on my first trip to New Mexico since I was perhaps at the wee age of 3 or 4; the only thing I remember from my previous trip was going to a grocery store where they had small, children sized grocery carts. I was quite impressed! As a souveneir, I suppose, I am currently sick. Dunno really what's the matter; sore throat, a bit of nasal congestion, achiness, and my right ear is stuffy and I can't hear out of it....It's really a weird sickness, one that I look forward to getting over. It is absolutely no fun to travel when you're in any less than superb physical condition. I should know; I've had earaches and other illnesses on road trips. It's no fun to walk around Yellowstone National Park with throbbing pain in your ear.   Well, I simply must take a shower; I've been informed that we're celebrating my eldest brother's birthday later this evening. Perhaps I'll go bury my woes in economy sized cans of Heinz ketchup.

      Busy, busy, busy! I'm doing my laundry right now so that I can pack in the nearby future....and I hate packing. It's so hard for me to choose what clothes I'll be wearing on a trip since I'm so capricious, and there's also the weather factor, etc.  So, today was unofficially National Skirt Day. I mean, we didn't even plan it, and Mary and I both wore skirts. We must be telepathic or something...and then my juggling relationship between Mary and Anne finally came to a breaking point when Anne kicked Mary and left a footprint on her skirt. It was a rather childish thing to do, and unfortunately I was kind of in the middle of the episode....but it's dealt with now, I believe.   Tomorrow I'll climb into some Boeing 737 and make my way to Albuquerque, New Mexico for an extended weekend. I'm not really sure of the details surrounding the trip, but I'm pretty sure my mom knows what's going down. I'll keep youse guys updated.  Oh, I was right. It WAS 5th position and i had NEVER seen it before in my musical career. Though if I hadn't been so frustrated I could have figured it out....

      Another memorandum:  By order of Jessica the Great, Spring 2004 has been hereby dubbed THE SPRING OF PARTIES! (A catchier title will be thought of in the near future)  Here is a preview to tide you over:  -Mystery Party. Who set fire to the chemistry lab? What happened to the answers to the test in the principal's office? Who copied that floppy? Just a few of the questions that will be answered during this historic day. Complete with role playing! -1st Annual Croquet Tournament and Garden Party which will feature a professional-grade croquet course. -Kovalent Killas picnic/zoological expedition. -Kazoo Choir cook out with optional camp out.  Oh man, this spring is going to be  so awesome! And I just realized that I can display my newly acquired pizza/bread making skills for at least one of the parties! It's hard being this popular...

      I'm a bit discouraged right now....it seems that at my last violin lesson my teacher assigned a piece that would require me to play in like 5th position, and for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about I'm NOT going to explain. So, I'm still personally limited to the 1st and 3rd positions (despite over a decade of playing), with the occasional and highly unneccesary in my opinion 2nd position. Meaning I won't be able to practice "Fantasia" something something by the boy Paganini...  It's been a month since my last violin lesson, and I have one Tuesday and of course I wait until 2 days beforehand to even begin practicing. And it's more discouraging because she keeps giving me these easy songs that I played when I was 7 except they're "reworked" to be a duet or in some new arrangement. I want harder pieces but I also want to be able to play them. Things are supposed to come naturally to me, damn it.  Memorandum:  The Kazoo Choir will have to practice on Wednesday since there is no school Friday, and also because I am leaving Thursday morning extremely early for the fair city of Albuquerque, New Mexico!

      The kazoo choir was GREAT! I mean, sure there could have been more people, but all the people that matter were there, so it was fantastic! Each week it will probably get a little bit bigger, and a little bit bigger until everyone will want to know all about this awesome kazoo choir that was thought up in a collaborative effort between Mary and I! Our shirts were also awesome!!  Today I went shopping with Anne, and we both bought these awesome polka-dot dresses. It's uncanny how similar our fashion tastes are...sometimes it's like a race in a store because if one of us finds something that we both like, either we both get it or it goes to the person who found it first. You really have to be a speed shopper in this friendship. So now, I need somewhere to wear the dress. It could be a "date" dress, but I may just have to settle for some other, less glamourous occasion...  And now I'm going to go sand some furniture with my brother!

Oh man, so cool. And tomorrow is the first meeting of the Kazoo Choir. AND I'M STARTING IT!! Plus, instead of yoga tomorrow, we're going to watch Richard Simmons' Sweatin' to the Oldies!!  I can already tell that tomorrow is going to be a funny day!

      It's always quite fufilling to see the fruits of ones labor. I think a hypothetical anecdote is in order, so let's say that one of your future offspring decides to become a pharmacist, just like his loving parent, and accidently discovers the cure to both AIDS AND cancer thereby exceeding the parental in fame and fortune? Now, some of those parents with a more pessimistic look on life might be jealous of his child's fame, but for the average father or mother figure, it would be pretty satisfying to share in such glory. Let's just say that the fruits of my labor have finally paid off....in the frozen foods section!  May I refer you back to an entry in my now famous blog from March 19, 2004: -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Interesting petition idea: Bring back pudding pops!  I've been informed by a friend that corporate America no longer sees it fit to manufacture the ever popular pudding pops anymore....though I was not sure what kind of "pudding pop" she was referring to. Fortunately, I have decided to throw my support behind this cause and see it through until we get what we want: PUDDING POPS! ----------------------------------------------------------------------  That's right, folks.  PUDDING POPS ARE BACK AND BETTER THAN EVER!    As I was browsing through the ice cream display today at the local BI-LO, I discovered that, oh, happy day! Corporate America and the big executives over at Jell-O have heard the lowly cries of a dedicated consumer! They have created a legacy that shall put a pudding pop into the hands of every obese child in America! Just like during the days of the Depression, the "Chicken in every Pot" slogan will ring from sea to shining sea, with a few alterations:  A PUDDING POP IN EVERY MOUTH.  It will become the slogan of major political parties and such celebrity figures as Dr. Phil and perhaps even Evan Bivens! People will create fad diets that revolve around this ice cream novelty, books will be written, and history will be made!  (Don't forget! You heard it here first! Please donate your 5 bucks to Jessica's "Save the Ice Cream Foundation")

      HAPPY SUMMER INITIATION BLOWOUT EXTRAVAGANZA PICNIC DAY!  In order to properly celebrate the new season of carefree, school-less days, I decided that we ought to do something worthwhile--something to put today, May 27th, on the map. Or calendar, I suppose. It all started like this:  Yesterday there was a movie on tv that I wanted to see, the kind of sappy romantic comedy that makes those of us who are less fortunate in the dating spectrum feel bad about themselves, but just like addictive drugs such as cocaine or heroine or even caffiene, we just can't stop watching. Unfortunately, I had a violin lesson and was going to miss the movie, but I decided to tape it and invite Mary over today to watch it. This morning rolls around, and Anne calls and wants to do something--preferably eat some form of lunch. Okay, I say! I can do this! I can accomodate 2 friends' plans at once! And right away I began planning today's Summer Initiation Blowout Extravaganza Picnic Day otherwise known as SIBEPD. So, Mary and I rendezvoused, went to pick up Anne and some KFC buckets of chicken, or the much more fun to say, BUCKET OF BEANS. Bucket of beans...it just flows off the tounge! Okay, so then we went to Ben's house, and then the Cinco de Mayo lake that I still have no idea where it is.   Almost all the way through our meal, a park ranger comes out of his little air conditioned guard station to inform us that we're not allowed to picnic here, it's an ancient Quaker cemetary. So, that was pretty funny.   I'm not sure why, but I conceeded to go to an Irish jam with my mom tonight...  Happy SIBEPDing!

      Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.  The above quote is from my recently declared, recently viewed, favorite movie Donnie Darko. Though, I can't really bestow that title with all of my teenage heart seeing as how there are so many other movies that also hold the title (The Princess Bride, LOTR, The Fox and the  Hound, etc.). However, this movie has swept over my friends like the bubonic plague. We've been bitten by the rats of independent films and are intrigued by this new world that has opened up for us. I mean, Mary and I had a deep, intellectual, and philosophical discussion this afternoon! Though it was ephemeral, it wetted my appetite. If you haven't seen Donnie Darko, I highly recommend it.   Only 2 days of school left, and they're not even real days. I'm definitely ready for school to end; everyone is starting to wear away on my ever-cool and composed exterior and getting on my nerves. I need summer. Though, I'm a bit apprehensive about this whole governor's school spiel. I mean, meeting new people, making new friends, learning things in a liberal environment...it will definitely be a growing experience.   You know how much I love to watch you work, but I've got exams to study for, my farewell party to plan, my wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped.

      Today, among other things and obligations, was an outdoor festival right on the doorsteps of my brother's apartment, and my brothers performed. Pretty cool. But, alas, now I'm home and shall do nothing for the remainder of the evening.   Graduation for East Davidson's class of 2004 today. I would just like to go on the record and say that it was extremely hot this morning; sweat was forming right under my butt then dripping down my legs. I don't know that I've ever sweat that profusely. Pretty disgusting.  And my terrible, terrible sunburn from yesterday--never again shall I trust SPF 8...  So, I had this elaborate, unfathomably deep revelation to discuss. Let's see if I can get around to it. Okay, so perhaps later when I'm feeling less silly.

      Okay, more Education related things today. But first, the rest of my week.   Sunday I was present at both my brother's graduation party and then I Junior Marshalled at baccalareate. I had to carry the senior flag and avoid a strategically placed trip wire. Churches are weird, man. Anyway, came back, enjoyed the rest of the party. Tried to go to sleep but I had the hiccups.   Monday was my brother's graduation from prestigious Wake Forest. Colin L. Powell was his commencement speaker. That's right, Colonel Powell (which was how his name was said. Pretty funny, in the Homestarmy way). You can only imagine how much fun Josh and I had laughing at that. So, after sitting through at least 3 hours of commencement, we tried to help my brother move out of his apartment, then came home, then went back to Winston to eat dinner with his girlfriend's family. They said I was precious; I heard them as I was leaving. Hah!  Tuesday was not important.   Wednesday was senior awards day and once again my presence as a Junior Marshall was required.   Thursday was not important.  Friday, today, was graduation practice so I didn't have to be at school until 9:00. I got sunburnt due to the fact that in my rush this morning, the only sunscreen I could find was SPF 8. And that doesn't do anything. So, then I went out to eat with Breanne, Mary, and Anna, then bought a cool pair of flipflops and then some sunscreen. And now I'm home. And tired.

      Once again, I've let you, the reader of blog, down. I promised to expound about my escapade with the new generation left over from the counter culture of the 60's and I let my life become too filled with superficial things to take 5 minutes to write in my blog. And my life was, in fact, filled with events out of my control, but inevitably revolving around the continuing theme of "Education."  Okay, so Saturday of the Hippies.  After going shopping for coveted white shoes and corresponding undergarments (the kind that are quite necessary for a white dress) my brother Joshtime whisked me away to Gtown for a night of video games and fun. After months and months of poor luck, I had finally located a copy of "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade Game" for Gamecube using 411. However, upon arriving at his downtown loft apartment, George, the hippie from the space next door at "Elsewhere" was outside and informed us of a laser show and a guitar concert going on.   You see, this place, this hippie non-commune, is a store. But not a store where you buy things; you own everything in the store as long as you're inside of Elsewhere, but nothing can ever be taken out of the store and nothing is bought. Quite a deep interpretation of consumerism. So Elsewhere is full of random things; broken toys, mugs, fabric, vintage clothing, telephone cars, Barbies, ancient typewriters, just shelves and shelves of stuff. For the obsessively compulsive cleaner, this place would be the dream of a lifetime; or perhaps their downfall if they became too overwhelmed.   Anyway, Josh and I proceeded to his apartment, then mutually agreed that we wanted to check out the laser show. You see, the only time previous to last weekend that I had ever ventured inside of Elsewhere was on New Year's Eve after another hilarious escapade that, due to space and other goings on in Chemistry this afternoon, will have to be posted on a slower newsday. So, we enter the annex building of Elsewhere and couches and chairs are set up along the sides; the room is dark except for, of course, the lasers and other lights. There is a slide show projector displaying fuzzy pictures on a rack of clothes; alphabet magnets spell out profound poems; balls from an abandoned ball pit (the kinds at Chuck E. Cheese, etc.) litter the floor (later we found out it was a game. While the strobe light is pulsing, you are supposed to throw the balls into a coffee can. Extremely difficult.).   After arriving, George handed both Josh and I a "deck" and we were told we could "trade and try to get better colors." My "deck" was orange and consisted of 2 orange tinker toy sticks, an orange car, a playplace ball, and this cool duck that was really a cheese grater. Josh had a blue deck. So we stayed for a while and listened to the mellow hippie music, tried not to succumb to the strange smells in the air that seem to go along with such counterculture habitats, and participated in the previously mentioned game. And I ate blue cotton candy. After a while, we left. As does everyone eventually. But, it was heartening to know that, if only for a little while, I was the sole owner of the entire store. It was a pretty fun evening, watching laser shows and playing TMNT.   And now, the end of school. Excuse me.

      I hope my landslide victory in the game of Life this afternoon symbolizes the way my life will end up. Let's see, I'll live in a Victorian home with wraparound porch, servants' quarters, marble fireplaces, and spiral staircases, and I'll make $100,000 every pay day for being an entertainer. Not too shabby. Oh, and I'll be married with only one kid. Actually, I think I'd have to have more than one child. Too oft have I seen the detrimental effects of being the only child.   I've had a headache since yesterday and I'm going to watch The Fox and The Hound tonight. Good times, good times.  Oh, I forgot. I won 3rd place in the chili cookoff. Not too shabby considering how many people were offended with the spiceyness of it.

      'Sup youse guys. Here's that update I promised. So, let's see...I'm now treasurer for the senior class next year, I took the AP Chemistry exam Tuesday and am not allowed to discuss the multiple choice questions ever and the free response could finally be talked about today. It was good to get that off my chest...I had a violin lesson last night and I also bought a lovely short white strapless dress for graduation. I am the assistant to Meredith as Junior marshalls. This means I'm second in the class. Pretty darned amazing, no? Our yearbooks this umm, year, have heat sensitive pages and change from red to yellow. Kinda cool. And, Mary and I played tennis this afternoon. We tied I think? I don't remember and I have a headache because I didn't drink enough water today. Great jorb.   Troy comes out tomorrow and I want to see it, not only because of Orlando Bloom, but because it's such a timeless classic of epic proportions...  Only 8 more days of school. Only a month until I go to governor's school.

      Damn it. I missed Jump's in-store appearance in Winston. It was Tuesday. And what did I do Tuesday? Nothing but beat Joshtime and Elizabeth at fighting games. I can't believe I wasted my time winning when I could have been basking in the glory that is Jump. Oh well.

      Happy Cinco de Mayo everybody! Yep, that's right. Today was Cinco de Mayo, and if you forgot to celebrate, according to the clock on my computer, you have 2 hours and 20 minutes left. Better hurry it up, youse guys.   As for me, I've already done all of my celebrating. I got done early this year. hah! Anydangway, after school, Mary, Ben, the random "BD," and I loaded up the celebratory Volvo, made a pilgrimage to the oh-so-degrading-to-Mexican-food-but-on-some-occasions-acceptable Taco Bell. Where, for 84 cents, I was able to buy 2 soft tacos thanks to my East Davidson discount card. You know, at Taco Bell they put sour cream on the tacos with what looks like a caulk gun. It was slightly disturbing to witness.   Anyway, back to the fiesta....we then journeyed to a faraway lake, or lago I should say since this is a Mexican holiday, in Jamestown maybe. There was a cool playground, an unsupervised carousel, and paddleboats for renting on the weekends. I think someone is going to have to take me back there, on a weekend, so I can paddleboat. Fun times. Then we played Goodminton with the Mighty Dollar set Mary had previously purchased, and, since Mary and I always have restrictions on our out-of-house hangout time, we had to return home. It was a pretty fun time, I'll have to admit. And hopefully I got some good pictures.

      Once again, my apologies. An update into my life:  Thursday: Along with my allies, Mary and my mother, I cornered and trapped the 3 kittens, put them in a cooler (with air, mind you) and called some sort of animal control. Friday: The final yoga meeting was held today so we had food and Twister. Weird times. Then, I went to walmart with Mary to stock up on the random makeup products for PROM 2004. Saturday:  Mary and her mom did my hair in a cool, curly 1940's-esque style, then I returned home and did the rest of my preparation in about 30 minutes. I looked absolutely stunning in my form-fitting, black satin gown with a revealing, but tasteful slit on one side, black high heels, long dangly earrings, long black gloves, a matching clutch, and a surprise corsage from my father. It seemed my entire extended family was present for the seeing off. So Mary and I rushed away to meet our 6:00 dinner reservations, and missed them by about 30 minutes, but utimately everything worked out.    At this point it becomes imperative that I detail a possible hinderance that could have thwarted our arrival to prom. For some unbeknownst reason, my windshield wipers on my ever-so-reliable Honda civic ceased to function properly. The driver's side wiper was moving slower than the right one and thus getting caught under it. I had quite a stressful ride to Mary's house on the rainy day Saturday turned out to be. However, her dad came to my, nay, our rescue by fixing the problem and we no longer would be forced onto the mercy of others. And now, back to the rest of the story....  And then...and then...and then! It was the beginning of prom. And no one wanted to be the first to dance, but then everyone did, and then everyone was dancing, a mixture of clean and dirty dancing, mostly in between. The DJ played mostly music I rarely can bring myself to listen to, but then...it's high school and I'm in the musical minority. I salsa-ed, tangoed, and dare I say, "booty danced," there was even some safe moshpitting going on during "Fight for Your Right [to party]," at least what I consider mosh pitting. I had my pictures made with my parents, since my father is required to attend prom every year, much to his chagrine, and countless other snapshots were taken with friends. And then the evening came to a close and we left for a rousing game of bowling. Mary and I tied with a whopping 56. And, it was over. The monumental prom was over. What to do know? Apparently we've been waiting for this moment our entire concious lives, so now what do we have to look forward to?  Overall, I enjoyed myself. I mean, perhaps I was a bit disappointed that my "dream guy" never appeared (and I mean this in my inside joke connotation, so the rest of you, just pretend you understand.) or that the bridge over which we had to make our entrance sucked so bad, or countless other things. But really, I had a fun time. I was especially glad I got to spend the evening with Mary and not have to feel like I was competing with some guy like I would have if her date had worked out. I think she had a good time with me also. I mean, I hope she did. Anydangway, I'd have to say my favorite part, and the part that made all the horrible music, annoying East Davidson students, and frufru Easter dresses on large girls worth it, was being so absolutely beautiful myself and having fun just being dressed up!   Okay, back to the summary: Sunday: Recovery. Hair of the dog, sweetie, hair of the dog. Hah. Just kidding. I did, basically nothing worthy of notation, though I did some Asex...i mean Apex review for the English exam. Then, I totally screwed myself over and took a 3 hour nap, disabling me from going to sleep until around 1:00 this morning. I never take naps. Way to go, Jesstown. Monday: Today. It was finally time to test what creepy mr. church taught us last semester in AP English. Turns out, it was nothing! The test was totally overwhelming, and I barely even began to discuss what the essay questions were asking. Unfortunately, I had to take a 30 year vow of silence on the test, so I'll tell you about it in 2034. Then, I ate at Mr. Gattis and spent a mighty dollar at the new Mighty Dollar in Tville. Kind of a shady place. After school Mary and I played Goodminton with her new Goodminton set from the Mighty Dollar. And now, I'm here. Sitting in front of my computer, depressed because the internet is slow today and keeps "timing out" while loading the new strong bad email. And I want a duck shirt.  Okay, bye!

      Have I mentioned how hilarious my Governor's School friends are? Not to undermine the hilarity of my friends back home, but these guys are always on! Okay, so my friend NC is here for clarinet, and those instrumental music guys have to practice an hour a day outside of class. However, she doesn't like the practice rooms that they provide, so yesterday I arrived in my room (don't forget that it's never locked) and I hear the lovely sounds of a clarinet drifting from Ann Bradey's vacated closet. Yes, dear friends, NC had locked herself in the extra closet and was practicing clarinet.   Let me just describe these closets to you. They're small, but functional, have sloped ceilings since I have a corner room, have no light inside of them, and shelves that extend from either side. NC had dragged a chair inside, hung up a flashlight from one of the towel hooks, set up her music stand, and even moved my small personal fan so that she could have ample air circulation. And don't  forget that she had literally dead bolted herself inside.   Naturally, I died laughing as soon as I walked in my room and discovered what was happening in the empty closet. And fortunately, it was such a fierce laugh that it immediately became the silent laugh that overtakes your entire body, forcing your shoulders to slope and making it impossible to walk normally or stand straight, allowing me to sneak out unnoticed. So, I'm dragging myself down the hall to Emma's room (I decided she needed in on the fun) and, still laughing, describe to her what is going on in my room. I mean, it was pretty freakin' hilarious.   Alright, so I had already given NC permission to use the extra closet as her personal practice room, but I had no idea how funny it would actually be when it played out.   Yeah, so today I missed a meeting with my science group and teacher. I just totally forgot. Hopefully they'll forgive me.   Tonight's required assembly was on how competitive schools are these days, with all of the testing, and basically the students who succeed in school have just figured out the system. The "No Child Left Behind" bullcrap was practically designed to leave kids behind with all of the extra testing! Because testing is designed to undercover the "winners" thereby undercovering the losers by default. Pretty kuh-razy stuff, I wish I'd taken notes. I think this Shapiro guy was the best speaker we've had in these 3 weeks.  But, anydangway, Gary Busey turned 60 yesterday. If you're questioning the identity of the previously mentioned celebrity, stop reading my blog, ignorant jerkface.

      'ello there! And a Happy Tuesday to you all. Today was a monumetal occasion...THE LAST DEBATE OF GOVERNOR'S SCHOOL! Yep. The Chad's class is drawing to a close and my last role as Elaine's sister has been dead and buried. A sigh of relief shall now escape my lips. My chapped lips because apparently I've misplaced my chapstick.   Tragic, really. I'm excited because there's another dance on Thursday! I was in a crazy dancing mood the other day, much to the dismay of Emma!  Move it along hot tub!

      Happy Sunday! It's been a busy visit filled weekend. Let's see....Mary and Ben came up yesterday, then my Mom took me out to dinner with Jake and Jenny, then Jake and Jenny brought me back here and stayed for the orchestra concert. Today, my mom and dad took me to Jake and Jenny's apartment and we hung out. then I got tons of groceries to tide me through the week.  I had fun with Mary and Ben, most definitely. But, I've noticed that visiting is just that; it's visiting. Trying to get the most out of a person in the shortest amount of time possible. And visiting is not the same as hanging out. However, it can't be the same like old times because it's a new situation. I'm off at a sheltered summer school and they're back enjoying my old life. Were I still in Tville for the summer I wouldn't have these unsatisfied feelings. I do need to clarify that I'm not unsatisfied. That's not the best word I suppose. I even feel like this with my parents. I'd prefer hanging out to visiting any day.   Hopefully I haven't offended anyone (especially Mary), and if you need some clarification feel free to comment or email the author.   I'll be home on Friday for a short break!

      Happy Friday! Unfortunately, since Governor's School (or as Elizabeth called it, "Government School" I think I like that better) isn't real school, we do have classes on Saturday and I'm really getting tired of discussing EVERYTHING.  And, since my door doesn't lock, everyone seems to think it's just acceptable to come in whenever they want. I found NC asleep on Ann Bradey's bed yesterday. And that's not the first time. acutally, I think it's more hilarious than annoying.   Okay, bye!

      I'm sick of role playing. The Chad can die. Does he think I'm shy and that's why I don't participate? Because it's not true. I just don't need the stupid role playing exercises to learn. I have ethics and somewhat have my own opinions, and just because I'm not a typical teenager and don't enjoy arguing about everything does not mean that I'm stupid OR shy. Or not a teenager. So that's basically what I've been bitching about this whole week. The whole story is long and involved, so if you're not on the inside you'll just have to fill in the gray areas.   I'm not used to having such a limited time to do so many things on the computer! I'm tired of typing.

Mary and Ben are going to visit this weekend! I'm excited. Those guys are 2 of the coolest friends ever. I miss them.   Only one more week and then I'll be home for a short break!

      A moment of silence, please, for the departed. My former roommate, Ann Bradey, moved out today whilst I was in 1st period. At least she did it the easy way; there was no awkward goodbye to stumble through. But, seeing all of her stuff gone really made me sad. I really did think she would be back.  Instead of all of the fun events, there is now a required assembly because people have been prank calling 911.

      The dance was pretty interesting. And, against my wishes, I did enjoy myself. It's a bit disturbing, however, when people you see in your highly intellectual classes during the day become hardcore booty dancers at night. A few times some guy tried to come up behind me, but as it is really disgusting to me, I just moved forward during each incident to avoid dancing. Eww. It's crazy how many people actually do enjoy dancing like that. I bet they're all in chorus.   NC says Ann Bradey is coming back today, evoking mixed feelings from myself. I really like Ann Bradey, but I enjoyed having my own room also. But, I'd really rather have her come back. I missed her. And my key doesn't work. It only unlocks the door.   Today is a very full day with a seminar on "The Paradox of Southern Feminism" at 4, and also the Reading circle that I signed up for but don't think I'm really going to attend. Later, there's "Juggling for Non Jugglers" and a faculty poetry reading. At 9:00, Open Mic Night.

      Day excursion to Reynolda house today.  Interesting, I suppose. I kept running into Goose, but successfully avoided him. I hope this doesn't last for the whole summer. I bet he doesn't even remember me anyway.   Last night after watching Frida, they equipped the students with sidewalk chalk so we could give our first impressions. I drew Teen Girl Squad with various correlating quotes that evoked some positive public response. It seems I'm making more and more Homestar connections here at Governor's School, and it makes me happy. Unfortunately, it just rained and all of the chalk washed away.   Right now, Zoolander is on TV and it's making me laugh.   There's a Chorus concert tonight and then a dance; not sure how I feel about that. I might not stay long. I have fun with Mary at dances, so my expectations might be too high. We'll see, though.

      Today Emma and I located the headphone jacks in these computers, so my Homestarrunner withdrawel is pretty much over! So, I went out to eat with the parents and my aunt and uncle, and I just kept remembering things that NC said and I kept cracking up. I think I've made some pretty cool friends. And tonight I'm going to go see Frida; you know, the movie about the crazy unibrow artist? Yeah, so nap time for now.  There's still a definite lack of packages and letters for me, however. I got a letter from my mom, and inside were a few blank index cards (and a card) so I was really confused. Really, I'll give you my address and you jerks need to write me. And send me cool packages that make my friends here jealous. Oh, and   Emma's   friends are coming to visit her tomorrow. Where are you guys? I don't think you care.

      Jessica H. Morris is now living in a single room. That means, an extra bed, that also means an extra closet and an extra desk and chest-of-drawers. However, it also (tragically) means that I have no roommate. Ann Bradey went home. Maybe just for a few days, but maybe for the whole summer. I miss her. I woke up this morning and felt lonely. I'll let you know what develops.   My mom and dad and aunt and uncle are visiting me today on their way to the mountains.   Last night we had a "run to the Borders" where they bused us all over to a shopping center to let us be "crazy go nuts." I bought a really cool rug and one of those paper lamps that was, alas, broken when I opened it. And I also bought some really beautiful stationary. Sorry, Mary, but I don't think they'd let you come to my class. Plus, my new stationary is being taken to class with me. But, if my roommate doesn't return you can sneak in and spend the night. Hah.

      So, let me just tell everyone what happened yesterday evening. In an attempt to give our teenage selves a chance to stay busy, GS arranged swing dance lessons and afterwards a "jam" so we could practice. We get paired up, despite the lack of ablebodied gentlemen, though due to the ratio of girls to guys I was eventually left partnerless, like many other girls. But anyway, I already knew the basics, but we got into turns and everything. Good stuff. Fun stuff. Afterwards, everyone (except for the leftover girls of which there were a lot, so I wasn't feeling too  left out or anything) began dancing and showing off their recently acquired skills. So, a teacher comes up to me and pairs me up with this guy, named "Goose." I'm kinda getting those "ahh, I'm kind of a nerdy weird guy that could be a potential stalker" vibes, but as I'm not dancing with anyone, I accept. And he did know the moves and everything, but I was a little freaked out, not making eye contact or dancing well I have to admit. So he asks me, "Are you looking for someone?"   Fumbling for an answer, all I came up with was some mumbles. Continuing the dance (this probably took place in like 3 minutes) and my "front-loading" (as you might say) bra became unsnapped and I had to rush to the bathroom to fix myself. When I came back, my roommate Ann and friend NC were preparing to leave. And I didn't want to be left alone to the whims of a poultry. So, the jerk side of me emerging, I mumbled something about having to go watch the Real World. Anyone that knows me should know that I would NEVER watch the Real World and even more seldom leave someone, however awkward or whatever as he, alone at a dance. I'm a nice person. But, honestly he didn't seem too upset but I stewed over my mistreatment for the remainder of the evening. But NC (hilarious, by the way, but I still miss you guys!) just kept teasing me about it so now it's kind of funny. And still sad. Today, I've seen him around campus twice, and I have (once again, like a jerk) avoided him. But like I said, he could've been one of those creepy stalker types so it was good I didn't "lead him on" or anything.   I have a request. By Friday I'm supposed to bring something in to my Area 2 class that I think is beautiful. It can be anything; a quote, music, something from nature. And, though it's true, I don't want anyone to suggest that I take myself. You're too flattering, honestly! Anyway, I can't remember anything as of late that has struck me as being extraordinarily beautiful. I'll try to rack my brain. Damn. I forgot I was writing an email to my brother.

      So, thanks for all the heartwarming emails I've received from you jerks. You guys are funny, and make me sad at the same time! I'm reading an email from my mom, and it just makes me somewhat homesick (I'm fine as long as I have something to do) so I'm sitting in the computer lab with people, I'm sure, reading over my shoulder and tears in my eyes. But, whatever. I talked to Mary last night, which was good.   However, I guess that's all for now. I'm not quite the blogger that I once was, perhaps.

      Welcome to the bowels of Governor's School, readers. It's my third day here, and I'm definitely not going to be the same person that I was when I left the sheltering, perhaps even confining grasps of you guys. Not to be sentimental or even morbid, or snobby. It's the truth. And, I don't really know what to say.   I really really really really want email, normal mail, phone calls, or even comments on my illustrious blog. I feel so isolated from everything, even in just three days, and would like to talk anyone. Even if for some reason I haven't talked to you in 3 months, or you're now an alcoholic, or got a sex change. If you like me as a person or whatever, take it upon yourselves to send me something. I might love you forever.   Once I get more adjusted to this life, I will write more about it. Maybe. I don't really know what's worth portraying to my readers, and if I should even consider myself a worthy source. You might be getting a one-sided blog view, and I don't want that to happen. So, expand your horizons and read interesting things, not just blogs, like awesome books. Enlighten yourselves so that you can keep up with me once I'm home. Hah.   Ummm, so back to old me. But I don't even know what that is. Random facts? No idea. Blabbering.

      Today I embark on a 6 week journey; a sojourn into my intellectual future. Governor's School. Just thought I'd make a final posting from my home base before I go off to the world of updating blogs from computer lab computers....  I will be able to receive, and check, email as well as normal postal mail. However, due to privacy reasons, I shall only give the prior and should you be wanting the latter you may proceed to email me, jerkface. So, if you forgot to tell me that you love me, or that I left dirty underwear at your house, or if you just want to tell me how awesome I am and how much you miss me, email this girl:  Jesstown@gmail.com. Who knows? I might even reply. Hah.   Okay, much more packing is yet to be done.

      Congratulations, blogger! This is my 100th post here at "Give my regards to Broadway..." and what an excellent post it's turning out to be! I've been contemplating over how I should spend this posting, since this opportunity only comes by every 100 times or so, and here were some of the ideas I came up with:  1. Some sort of hilarious clip show. You know, read through my previous 99 posts and compile a list of some of my funnier moments; capture the true essence of what it means to be Jesstown. 2. WIDESCREEN VERSION! I could go all out and expand the the right and left of the screen, no more stupid full screen ratios.  3. A widescreen clip show. This seems the perfect combination of classic "Jess" and contemporary "town" for a gal like me. Unfortunately, I have not compiled the stuff that makes this blog so great, nor have I the means to make my blog widescreen. The least I can do is just think about it. And just so you know, it would have been pretty awesome!  Happy 100th!  Your favorite linguist, Jessica

      Finally, I've got a little extra time to breath! It's been a busy week for Jesstown. And I haven't had time to breath. It's been very bad for my health, mind you. So where did I leave off?  Thursday evening after going to Hobby Lobby with Anne then hanging out at her house for a while, I went to Gboro to Jake and Jenny's apartment. Actually, on the way, Jake and I stopped at the restaurant where Jenny works and she made us Boba teas. They're crazy fruit flavored smoothie-like things, and on the bottom are these things called tapioca pearls that are kind of like giant booger-like consistency. But strangely good. Anyway, then we went to Jake's apartment where Patrick was watching Curb Your Enthusiasm with Biscuit (the cat). Later Jenny showed up, and also Andy. 'twas fun hanging out with those guys. Lots of laughing. Anyway, they eventually all left, Jenny went to bed, so it was just Jake and I. We watched X-Men 2, then he got a bit drunk with hilarity ensuing. We stayed up till 6 or so until finally falling asleep. He's a funny drunk, though, I must admit. He kept telling me the same things over and over, and having hilarious revelations. I like that guy!  Friday, after waking up at 11(!!) Elizagerth took me to lunch, then Josh's apartment. I took a shower and she went to the computer lab, then she came back to get me and we went to her apartment where I took a nice, long nap. Then Josh called to tell us we were late, as we were going to a baseball game, so we rushed to his apartment. Yeah, so I went to my first baseball game. It was fun, and they gave us whacking sticks which made it even more fun. We almost got hit with a couple of stray foul balls as well. So dangerous! After the game, we went to see  The Village  which was absolutely fantastic! It was so much better than I even thought it would be, and I was expecting it to be great! That M. Night Shymalan sure can turn out some great stuff! [The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs]  Saturday, Josh's band was supposed to play at a blood drive, but they backed out due to terrible conditions on site. It was hot, there was no where for them to set up, and there was a really loud generator going in the background. So we ate Thai food, which is amazing. I don't think I can eat Chinese food anymore, it's so good. Elizabeth and I went swimming at her apartment (after waiting the obligatory time as to not get cramps of course) and then she took me home. And, since I'm an unstoppable party machine, I left my house again in the direction of Anne's to celebrate her birthday. It was a really fun party, with a cement truck piñata and everything. Then Mary and I were going to spend the night, but Mary's mom told her she needed to put God first, so Mary left. Eventually Ben came over and we watched Dazed and Confused. Good show.  Sunday I played Oregon Trail for a while at Anne's house.  Here lies Strong Bad Loved by all; never wet the bed.  Then my mom told me to come home, so I obeyed. Since then I worked feverishly on my summer project. I finished this morning at 1:30. Yay for me.  Today was the first day of school. And I totally got to leave an hour early. Rock, rock on.

      Unfortunately that Oregon Trail disc was just a demo. I was all excited, I had decided to be a doctor, I bought all of the necessary equipment, 8 oxen, 1000 pounds of food, 1000 bullets, 2 wagon tounges, etc., named all of my wagon-mates (Zeke, Jesstown, and I don't recall the others), forded 2 rivers (at both crossings my wagon tipped, but I managed to recover everything and no one was hurt), then finally I arrived at Ft. Bragg or somewhere, was trading for more stuff, then clicked on continue. That's when it informed me that it was just a demo, but if I purchased the real Oregon Trail I could go all the way to Oregon. Bummer.  So then I started playing a game called "Museum Madness," another demo, but I was quite perterbed after helping the Orville brothers put together their engine so I quit.     I have also been working on my summer project. Having already finished the book, I'm now going back and rereading each chapter then doing one quote as was assigned. I think I'm on chapter 25 or something now. Fortunately I do like the book.     Tennis practice continues this evening, then I shall be going to Greensboro as was previously mentioned.  ¡Paz!

      Tennis tryouts commenced today. Well, they weren't tryouts so much as practice. There were about 13 girls there, I think 5 of them were new/freshmen. One girl asked me what grade I was going to be in.  Sadly, I guess I still don't look my age.  Anyway, Sency isn't coaching anymore which means we'll actually have to play this year. That's a good and bad thing, but I don't think the season will be quite as fun as the previous 2 years. Plus Farah graduated. It's sad without her.  Our new coach is the "tennis pro" at the country club. Whatever that means. I actually took lessons from him last year. I'll definitely miss Sency though.      Woah. There's an Oregon Trail disc laying by the computer. I wonder if it would work on this computer...perhaps I'll try it out later. I love that game! "dun dun dun...." [the noise that plays when there's bad news]  Jebediah contracted the measles. Rest for 2 days?  OR You just ate poisoned berries. Rest for 2 days? OR Abagail broke her leg and died. Rest for 2 days?     Almost too much fun.  BTW, I got my pictures from GSW today. They're awesome! I'll be sharing them within the next few days...so keep posted.     Tomorrow involves more tennis practice, then I'm hopefully driving up to Gtown to spend the night with Jake, then Friday with Elizagerth, then Friday night with Joshtime, then Saturday morning with a combination of all those guys. THEN Anne's birthday party has been scheduled for that evening! Fun times ahead!

      So, all in all, as my dear friend NC said, "I don't want things to go back to normal. I hate change and yet I love it at the same time. There's no such thing as going back to normal--there's only finding a new kind of normal. And maybe that's good....and maybe not."     I think in my case, it should be good.      And yes, I did steal that practically word for word from NC's blog. It just seemed so fitting!

      Well hello from beyond GSW! I've been home for 3 days now, reacquanting myself with everything. It's strange being home. Anyway, sorry I've neglected to post. A summary is in order.     Friday  afternoon was a shitty one. I felt like there was some conspiracy for everyone to go off and leave me, like they didn't want my company or something. Hopefully that wasn't true, but all that aside, I was upset. So after getting my zine, I went to my room. Then I remembered that I needed to RSVP for the Beta club pool party, as Friday was the deadline. So, I called, asked for Shaylen or whomever I was supposed to call, and was informed I had called the wrong number. Well, I tried back a few minutes later, dialing very slowly and very acurrately. The same voice answered, and I told them I'd made a mistake again. So, the person said something fairly rude and hung up. Had I not been in such an emotional state, I wouldn't have taken it as such. But, being in the position I was, that just set it in motion. So, ask me what I did Friday afternoon, and I'd have to say that I stayed in my room all alone and cried. It sounds pretty pathetic, and I'll admit that it was. Though, that was the first time I've cried in a really really long time. Longer than I can recall, really. I mean, sure I sometimes tear up when I have to say goodbye, or maybe the occasional tear jerker movie, but that's the extent. I was weeping. Very strange for me, I must say.     Anyway, all my emotions now spent, I began getting ready for the dance. Emma dropped by my room unexpectedly, and the conspiracy theory was gone. It's amazing how effective the powers of random human contact are. Anyway, I let Emma wear my awesome pink polka dot shoes, and I looked stunning in my prom dress and corresponding accessories. NC was gorgeous in her prom dress, and Megan was equally as good looking in her dress. We were 3 hot mommas, I must say. After taking the obligatory pictures, we arrived at the dance, where, alas, not many people were dancing. After a while things picked up, and I'll have to say that the fancy dance was the best they had all summer. We got a circle going with Stevie, Christine, and the Muskrats, and random people would join in. 'twas nice. Once again, I did not make contact with Pretty Hair Boy, but oh well. My last night there was focused on the friends I already had. After lasting out the evening until the last dance, I was separated from the Muskrats, but joined up with them again at the midnight breakfast. Then we all went back to our rooms and changed, then hung out on the patio for one last night of cards, music, and casual conversation. It was decided that we were all too tired for a sleepover, so I did a little packing and went to bed.      Saturday  morning we all skipped out on normal breakfast so we could pack some more, NC finally moved the remnants of her stuff from the closet, and then we went to our final Area 1. We got certificates and then filled out evaluations of GSW. Then it was time for the final assembly. Emma, Megan, NC and I all sat together, and the chosen students asked their pressing questions, then the dance students performed to a CD of one of the chorus concerts. The beautiful song and the fact that we were actually leaving hit me, and I started crying again. Not weeping this time, though. Then we all had to say goodbye to eachother. I hugged Emma and Megan, then Megan and I ran off to find NC. I found NC outside of the dorm and immediately started bawling anew. I found out that I'm a terrible cryer. I'm uncontrollable and spastic once I start. Eventually my mom showed up in my room. When she noticed my red eyes, she asked if I was okay. And that's the worst question I can be asked when crying. It just sets me off again. Who knew I was capable of such emotion? Anyway, that over, and Josh comes to help us carry out my stuff. I really did have a lot. I think it took 3 total loads with the 3 of us.      Saturday evening  was my welcome home party. A lot of people showed up; my grandparents, aunt and uncle and cousins, Anne, Mary, and Ben, Josh and Jake and Jenny of course, Pat, Everett, Bonny, and any others? I can't remember. Anyway, it was hecka weird being around Mary, Anne and Ben again. I don't know if it was because they were all secretly mad at me (which I found out later) or just because I'd been away for 6 weeks, or a combination. Anyway, I perhaps wasn't the most attentive hostess and they all left really early, all at the same time mumbling things about curfew....Anyway, I was playing croquet with Everett, Pat, Jake, Joseph, and Jennifer so it didn't really bother me too much. So, I enjoyed my party but it was quite a shock to be immersed so quickly into my old life.      Sunday  I simply hung around. Last night, my mom coerced me into going to Walmart with her so I could get my film from GSW developed. After being sheltered for the past month and a half, I have to say that the outside world is frightening. The commercialism of walmart scares me, the type of people that shop at walmart scares me (I'm pretty sure the populations of Mexicans, overweight children, and people sporting mullets have all tripled), fast food restaurants symbolize the ultimate evil in the world to me now, drivers startled me, and the list could go on. Was it just because I've been "enlightened" by my experiences, or have I really been that sheltered? Anyway, it made me miss GSW as if I couldn't miss it enough. I was also missing the accesibility of everything. I mean, all I had to do was walk out the door and bam! There's someone to hang out with. Everything and everyone is just right there. That was awesome.      Today  was my mom's birthday. My dad and I went to a salvage store ('twas a pretty shady place) where I bought my mom a credible book on tape (she seriously loves those things) for pretty cheap.  Corelli's Mandolin.  It's a pretty good read, that one.  Or listen I suppose. Then, I had to go to walmart  again.  Ugh. Twice in 2 days. But, I have all my school supplies now. I made my mom a cake, and the cake part was pretty good, but the frosting was questionable. I made my dad taste it before I put it on the cake, and apparently he's the worst taste tester ever. But I forgive him. Then I spelled out "52" with gummy worms on top. It was cute, but weird tasting. hah. Now I need to get to work on my summer reading. I've been working pretty sparingly on it. And tomorrow I'm getting my hair cut. I'm considering long, sideswept bangs again. But maybe I'll hold off until tennis season is over. Bangs can get in the way during such events.     Anyway, needless to say I have really missed GS. It's been really hard adjusting to being back at home. It's been boring, something that rarely happened at GSW, and trying. Who knew I'd get so attached? And it will be difficult getting back in with my friends. It's really hard to be away for such an extended amount of time and then come back, with completely different experiences, and expect to immediately fall back into the norm. Maybe that's why I was hanging out more with the older crowd at my party. They've all been through this with college, so maybe they could identify better. Anyway, I don't really know. Governor's school was awesome, and I'll never regret going. I can't believe it's over!

      So, i started packing today. I was going to wait until tomorrow and just throw everything in bags and suitcases however haphazardly and deal with it when I got home, but everyone made me paranoid about how much stuff I had to pack.&nbsp; I mean, I didn't think I had that much, but I guess I really do. So I went through my drawers and pulled out everything that I definitely won't need in the course of one more evening and morning. It's so sad. I took down all of my posters and whatnot. But, the beds are still made in preparation for the sleepover tonight. I don't know if we'll stay up all night or not.   The MSCL shirts are in! They have a big picture of Jordan Catalano/Jared Leto on the front!!! I'm so happy!   I've taken so many pictures this week! I feel a bit lavish and like I'm wasting them, but I forgot to take them at the beginning of the summer, so I'm making up for it. I'm not as excited about the fancy dance as I was yesterday. I don't have anyone to do my hair (like Mary!) so I'll just have to do it like normal, but with more poof. Hah! Anydangway, Emma introduced me to a really addictive computer game...so I'm gonna go....

      'sup, youse guys. Today was my last Area 1 with Leslie and Matty. We wrote our Science Manifestos and discussed how things work in conversations. Like whose ideas are ignored, or what sort of people get interrupted, and the difference between males and females in discussions. Like, men talk to establish hierarchy and women talk to establish community. I think it's fairly true. I mean, some people can fill both criteria but of course hardly any rule can encompass everyone.   So the Steve shirts came in today. Steve is the hot art TAC, and TAC for Babcock. Anyway, all of the guys worship him and practice devout Steveism. So the shirts have a picture of him on the front. They're pretty cool. I almost wish I had gotten one. Actually, Jake had a few art classes with Steve at Wake, and sometime before Jake and Jenny started going out, Jenny went on a date with him. It's pretty funny.  And  Steve and Helena (my TAC for Clewell) have been dating this summer! Wow!  Today was also the last Area 3, and it was kind of sad. Even though none of those people meant much to me during the rest of the summer, they were all talking about how awesome GS was and how much they were going to miss it. And it was all true. It's going to be really weird to go home...  Tomorrow is the "Fancy Dance." Kind of like the prom of GS. It's just a semi-formal, so I still haven't decided what I'll wear, formal or semi-formal. I'm excited! And afterwards I'm having a sleepover in my room with NC and Emma and I guess anyone else who wants to come. Unfortunately Megan (one of our other Muskrats) is in Gramley and they won't let her come over to Clewell after curfew. We already made the proper inquiries. So, instead we're just going to leave on Emma and Megan's cell phones and let her know everything that's going on. It will be so sad to have one of our number missing!  Tonight we had the Academic Fair which means I'm finally done with my flowers project. It was interesting and everything, but my group members weren't always the most compatible. Basically, all we did was give out surveys to find out the "underlying psychological appeals of flowers." I wrote this goofy paragraph thing to put on our poster. From memory, it went something like this:   What is it about flowers, the reproductive organs of plants, that is so alluring to us as humans? Flowers, which serve no purpose to us, have long been a token of affection, inspiration to artists, and the center of Clewell patio. These queries led us to our ultimate questions. Are there any main reasons why people are drawn to certain flowers? What is it about them that people particularly like?    Anyway, it was cooler on the poster. And, I believe that's all for today!

      I got a computer today with a terrible keyboard, so I'm having to type very decisively, pounding and practicing good typing technique and whatnot. There's no margin for sloppy typing today, my friends.   We had to do evaluations of our teachers and just the overall science program today. I hate being mean, so I wrote what I really thought, but then added in nice stuff:   &nbsp;  Chad's class was great because all of the topics he chose to debate were very relevant to today's scientific community. Students were always prepared and knew their role through ample research time. However, the debates became absurdly redundant, everyone got stereotyped into a certain kind of role, and I didn't like much past the first week. But, the Chad is a great person, and I really liked him!  &nbsp;  Hah! Well, there are only 2 more days of classes. This is saddening but simultaneously gladdening. My classes, I could do without, but my cool, cool friends? No dice. I mean, when I wanted to talk today, Emma was just right down the hall. All's I have to do is go down there, plop in her comfy butterfly chair, and chat her up about my thoughts. 'tis great. Once we go home on Saturday, how often will I be able to talk to NC, Megan, and Emma? I mean, on the internet, I'm sure. But real life.....I don't know. Perhaps I'm worrying needlessly. But I'm still a bit sad.   And then there's the thought of going back to my old group of friends. It's going to be very strange to hang out with them again. I hope I don't feel any sort of "mental superiority" when I'm back with them. I mean, are the trivial high school types of things that have still been going on with them this summer, going to seem completely trivial and uninteresting to me? Am I going to have to deal with Mary's inner struggles for the rest of the year? Or will I simply and easily fall back into the old ways of things, where Mary's inner struggle is just as troubling to me as her?   And I'm not trying to say that I'll never be able to fit in with my "dumb" friends again just because they didn't go to Governor's School. I'm just worried about what will happen, is all. Plus, I have been out of their world for the past 6 weeks. I've become more involved with the philosophies of science than relationships, mine and other peoples...  Well, there's another long post for you to digest. Oh, tomorrow is the academic fair, so all of the academic areas of GS have made posters to present a summary, or perhaps " summer -y" of what we've done this summer. So I'm doing it with my Flowers group. We uncovered the psychological themes of flowers. Pretty interesting, kind of. We have to finish our poster tonight.   And yes, Emma. I was asking you to a   CHALLENGE!

      Today was&nbsp;a fun day! Maybe I just haven't been aware of how much Governor's School has to offer. I mean, it wasn't hanging-out-with-Josh-on-a-Saturday-night-playing-Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles kind of fun, but compared with last week's blahs it was. The program we used this morning in Charlie's class was wayyy cooler than Berkely Madonna. You could draw your own "agents" that go in the equation, like healthy people and sick people, or red fish or yellow fish. It was cool. I drew So&amp;So, and for the sick person, I made So&amp;So green! Hah. And then in Area 2 we got pizza, and we were also supposed to bring in something funny, so I was going to use the data projector and computer to show Homestar Runner. Unfortunately, perhaps the site was being updated since today  is  Monday, and so it wouldn't load. I was so sad. We've still continued with our "Why is the sky blue?" conversation in Area 1, but I lightened the mood with a hilarious song. Leslie asked, "Well, what about monopoles?" or something, trying to compare them to our present topic, and Emma responded, "I believe in monopoles!" So I came up with: &nbsp;  Do you believe in monopoles? Where'd ya come from, you sexy thing!  &nbsp;  It was funny, I must admit. You see, they (scientists) had long hypothesized that a north pole could possibly exist without a south pole (Emma, correct me if I'm wrong) but they had no proof. So somehow they set up this experiment, and on Valentine's Day in like 1980 or something, they got data that supported their theory. But they've never gotten the experiment to repeat. There's probably someone sitting right now watching the experiment for signs of a monopole! Anyway, I put it to song. You know how it goes....  My Nalgene is no longer missing! You see, Saturday whilst waiting for my mother, I was sitting on a bench outside of my dorm, and when she drove up, I ran to greet her, the good daughter I am. Unfortunately, I left my poor Nalgene bottle sitting on the bench. I realized it in the car, but decided that it would either be there when I returned, in the lost and/or found, or perhaps I had simply left it in Emma's room with her collection of Nalgenes. Anyway, Saturday when I was signing back in from leaving campus, I inquired if there was a purple Nalgene in the lost and found. No dice. I was so sad! My Nalgene was MIA! I had only had it for almost a week! So, as I had nothing to do until 9 that evening, I made 4 posters to plaster on the bench where I left it.   "Have you seen this Nalgene?" they inquired. Or, "Are you my Nalgene? If you match these descriptions, you could be my Nalgene! Purple, 16 oz. narrow mouth, no stickers, full of water at time of disappearance..." And one said "Missing Nalgene: A week old purple Nalgene has been missing from this bench since approximately 3:40 on Saturday, July 17th. The owner, Jessica H. Morris, is very distraught. Please return to Clewell 302, or to the Lost and/or Found in the Governor's School Office."   As you can clearly see, I was going crazy with grief. So, I put the 4 posters on the bench, and waited, and waited. Sunday, our science TAC said that she knew who had it, and she could get it to me by tomorrow. I didn't want to fill myself with false joy...count my chickens before they hatch, that sort of thing. So I didn't dwell upon it. It had rained, and the orange marker I had used to write on my signs had dripped down creating a morbid mood. Last night after curfew (I myself was becoming dehydrated by this time, having no water bottle with which to quench my thirst), I heard a knock on the door. It sounded like the music of angels.&nbsp;I just knew that I was about to get my Nalgene back. We had a connection, you know?   Slowly, I turned the golden door knob to behold my savior! A chorus girl named Susan smiled back at me! "I saw your signs," she said. "I picked up your Nalgene because it was raining and I didn't want it to get lonely." "Thank you so much! You don't know how much I've missed her!" I replied, the smile on my face genuinely conveying my emotions. I was so happy!  So, I don't know if she picked it up really to get it out of the rain (I mean, Nalgenes are indestructible, I wouldn't have been too worried about it) or if maybe she just wanted the cute little mini Nalgene for herself. Whatever. But if I hadn't put up those signs, I might never have gotten it back.&nbsp;I'm so glad that I did!   Well, I hope you enjoyed my dramatic accounts of the Nalgene caper. It was quite traumatic, really. I really have to pee now. The effects of being hydrated, I suppose. Thank you, Nalgene!

      My last real Saturday at Governor's School. Spend it wisely,  Jtown. Yes, yes. Well, I had my usual 2 morning classes, then had  lunch, then made my way to the Fast Food Nation reading circle meeting.  I really didn't want to go, but I'm glad that I did. It was really fun.  There were only 5 people, so I was really comfortable discussing things  and bringing up some of the more moving ideas from the book. It was  great. It even made me think that perhaps I should have come in English  as opposed to Science where we discuss why the sky is blue in such  outrageous proportions that completely go over my head. But I  don't regret the things I have learned and experienced in science, so  don't fret.   For my Area 3 class, I'm supposed to write a letter to my future self,  and Rodney will mail them back to us in a year. It seems pretty  interesting. What kind of stuff will I say to my future being? This is  kuh-razy.  Well, my mom is coming to visit me this afternoon, and perhaps take me to a movie. I promise I won't miss curfew tonight!  &nbsp; Oh, last night we walked to see Supersize Me. It was pretty good. My favorite part was when Morgan, the guy who ate McDonald's for 30 days, said that when he had a kid, every time they drove past a McDonald's he was going to punch his kid in the face so he wouldn't associate McDonald's with a warm, fuzzy feeling that most kids have. Pretty freakin' hilarious. They were also showing Bowling for Columbine, but as I stated in a convo with Emma, two "Shockumentaries" in one day would be overwhelming. Instead, I went back to my room to finish Fast Food Nation, and accidently fell asleep. I slept from about 8 to 10, finally ate dinner, talked to Jake, did some "power yoga" and went back to sleep. It's been really nice at night lately. Not too hot. I actually put my comforter back on the bed last night! Okay, I think I'll go hunt down some of my comrades.

       How are youse guys doing today? I'm in a rather "blah" mood myself, once again. I think I need a change of scenery. Everything is getting so routine here. Allow me to explain:   There's nothing new to talk about. Unfortunately, at meal times we're a very unexciting bunch, rarely saying much at all. It's not because we secretly hate eachother or anything, but simply we haven't done anything new or kuh-razy to talk about in a while. And I'm not offended or anything that we don't have much to say (I'm particularly guilty of this), I just am pointing it out.   I think I've been stereotyped as the spineless girl who just follows Emma around and can't make choices on my own. And maybe that's partially true. I do like to go where Emma goes because she's freakin' awesome. And, due to previous experience I am quite indecisive. But I hope that I'm not coming off as "Oh, everyone else is sooo great so let me copy what they do." That's not what I'm trying to do at all. As evidenced in previous blogs, I can't stand it myself when someone directly copies me. But I wish I had a better way to word that...it seems kind of mysterious with an underlying secrecy...   Area 1 is spent discussing why the sky is blue and it's gone to such depths that I cannot pay attention. 3 days we've spent on this. And by now I just really want to know the answer.   For some reason, and I speak honestly, I cannot formulate thoughts when I'm sitting in class. I don't know if it's because I have acquired some sort of attention problem, or my brain is simply too overwrought to function properly, or I've secretly trained myself to stay quiet. But honestly, even if I wanted to participate in the discussions that take place every single day here, I wouldn't be able to think of anything to say. And perhaps that in itself is simply an excuse.    So, using blogger's new bulleting mode, I've detailed my grievances. And I'm still having fun at GS. I'm watching a lot of movies, but they're intellectual movies. Last night I saw Earth. It was excellent. So intense. It was about when India and Pakistan split up in 1947. It had romance, violence, politics, religion, sex. 'twas great. And not just because of the sex. Tonight Emma and I are going to go see Supersize Me. There is a definite fast food muckraking theme to my summer! Should be a good show.

      Ugh. Frustration station today. I don't really have one reason to blame for my demise, but everything seems to be adding up and piling on itself. Headaches are running rampant. I felt like I got hit with a load of bricks today.   I don't really know how to describe my predicament. It's indescribable, I suppose. I guess I'll just go sit in my room 'til dinner. How sad.   Geeze, what's my problem?

      I'm so excited about my new screen name! Agent Jesstown! This is the official jump off! I already have a jingle. Ready?  "She fights the law, and she also fights the crime but not as much. Agent Jess!"  I'm a double agent, then I guess. But still Agent Jesstown. I was initially thinking along the lines of "AgentJtown" but "AgentJesstown" was more aesthetically pleasing. NC started calling me AgentJtown and I loved the nickname. However, I think you'll all agree with my aesthetics.   I don't know how I manage to run out of money so quickly when I'm here. I guess I blow it all on random things. I currently have $6, and that's gotta get me into the movie "Supersize Me" on Friday. Plus, there are t-shirts being designed like crazy here, and they're all pretty cool. Meaning I want them. I just paid for the main one, with a list of 10 reasons we came to GS for the summah. And then Kaila designed a cool one for science. Plus the Clewell one might possibly be cool. And if I decide I'm in love with MSCL enough and I'm not just being a poser I might even want one of those. Luckily, my parents are visiting this weekend and can give me some monies. I just don't know where all my money is going...Bed, Bath, and Beyond?

      Add this buddy name to your list, jerks: AgentJesstown. That's right, ThajMo has a change of address, and it rocks. This is pricey real estate, yo. Like Boardwalk or something.   Well, that's all for the moment. I'm wearing my awesome pink polka dot shoes today! How exciting. Tonight is the final open mic night. I wish I had learned to play guitar. I'm such a slacker. However, my dad said that he's fixing my violin, and I can't wait to play it again. There were no serious problems with it other than a few cracks and the neck was starting to come up....but whatev. My violin is so awesome, and it's really old. It was built in like 1850 or something and sounds BEAUTIFUL. Josh keeps trying to convince me to sell it to him, but no dice.

      'ello, love! Today is Tuesday. My second-to-last Tuesday of Governor's School. And I was thinking, today, how I want it to be over, but I don't want to end either. I mean, I could totally be fine without the hour-and-fifteen-minute classes spent discussing a pool cue that is a lightyear long and how quickly you would be able to feel when you poke a planet a lightyear away. But then, whenever in my life will I be able to sit through such discussions? I really think I've wasted my time at Governor's school, and it's been my own fault. You get out what you put in, and to be honest I haven't been contributing much. I basically just sit and be a blob. I mean, I'm mostly still paying attention, but I probably would understand more if I took an active role in the class.   But that's not necessarily what I'll do. I don't really mind being a blob. It's more of a warning to future attendents of such academic situations. I think if it were more focused on academic things, like electrochemistry persay, I would be more involved because it's something tangible that I can understand why we're learning it. But that's not what GS is suppposed to be about, and I'm totally content with my experiences here!  We're ordering out. Chinese! MSG!

      I TOTALLY FORGOT TO WRITE ABOUT THE MASQUERADE BALL!   Okay, to set the scene...  Saturday night after the orchestra concert there was a masquerade ball.   THE END  Just kidding! Okay, so I finally got to wear that blue strapless 80's prom dress. And I crimped my hair and teased it a bit, put on dark blue eye shadow and tons of mascara, wore some borrowed jewelry from Megan, and totally rocked the scene. Unfortunately, the dance part sucked. I wasn't in one of my crazy dancing moods. I mean, I still had fun, but the best part was dressing up. Kinda like prom.   Okay, this is really the end.

      New Teen Girl Squad today! I'm watching Emma watch it right now. It looks pretty hilarious by the way she's laughing so much. For some reason her computer didn't work and she had to use mine...  Wow! I didn't realize it had been so long since I updated. I had a pretty nice weekend. No one came to visit me on Saturday, nor did anyone visit my friends, so we all hung out and watched "Como Agua Para Chocolate," which was a funny movie. Especially with my random cussing. Sunday my dad took me out to lunch and then to Target, where I bought 2 shirts with Ralph Wiggum on them. Then, Josh and Elizagerth came and we went to see Spiderman 2. Oh man, so totally awesome. I simply must see it again. Then, I was 50 minutes late for curfew (visiting hours end at 6 on Sundays) and then totally skipped out on the required play to a French movie that turned out to be completely terrible. None will be the wiser.....  Friday at the Borders run I bought another fan (I have 4 now), a mini Nalgene that secures my place as the miniature hippie I've become, and some string lights for my room. Yay. But yeah, 4 fans for one person. I've gotta be the "coolest" girl in Clewell.   Send me mail! Or postcards if you're going anywhere interesting, like, I don't know, Denver.

      'sup jerks. Today has been a normal day. We discovered that in fact Leslie and Richard are dating. It made me happy, though I think I should have been disgusted or something. Anydangway, it's hard to explain.   Last night I watched My So Called Life in the TAC's room. It's been going on for a while now, but last night was the first time I went, and it was pretty cool. I remember Anne's mom used to watch it all the time and tape it and stuff so they always made fun, but I seemed to like it.   Today was college day, actually I believe the whole week is oriented around college. But, I picked up a few things. About college. I mean, I'm sold. And, yeah. Border's tomorrow. Rock, rock on.

      I've been saying "that's crazy!" a lot. And to everything. Even things that aren't crazy. It's pretty crazy. And funny.   Today is Anne's birthday! I sent her a letter because I think she's out of town. But anydangway, the heat up here is, as they say, sweltering. It has been bearable before this week, but I've been forced to remove my comforter and it's practically impossible to sleep in anything more than my underwear.   That's crazy! See, there I go again. Tonight the Natural science kids from East are coming up for a speaker on dark matter. He came for our class this afternoon and was pretty cool. It made me regret that I didn't know more about that field of science so I didn't exactly grasp everything, do he did a very good job of explaining himself. Another guy came with him, and he was kinda cute. Megan and I think there's something going on between him and Leslie, our Area 1 teacher.   But anyway, I believe that's it for today. Except that everyone has been giving me compliments on my homestarrunner messenger bag! I feel cool.

      Today felt weird in my classes, just readjusting to everything. But I got all of my extra stuff in my room, hung up my Two Towers poster with a large picture of Elijah Wood on it, made a cool calendar on my door with post-it notes, and hid a few key foodstuffs in undisclosed locations. The masquerade ball is this Saturday and I'm excited. I think I'll finally get to wear that blue sparkly sequin prom dress! I think I bought it when I was in middle school for Halloween, but that year I opted to go trick-or-treating as a nerd. Pretty funny, I think. I had suspenders and undawears hanging out and everything. But anyway, the dress is a short blue tube dress and the bottom is really poofy. The top part is sequined. Yay!  Okay, that was weird. I just saw a movie about Jamaica and the terrible situation it's in because of some huge loan from the IMF that has put the country in huge debt that it can barely repay. Kuh-razy stuff. It was kind of hard to understand all of it, though, because of the Jamaican accents. But still good. And kuh-razy!  Well, I believe I'll skedaddle. (I just heard some girl talking about her AP grades...so apparently they're in?!! Exciting and insane!)

      Well, my mega tote is packed, my laundry is done, the groceries are sitting by the door, the lists have been checked, and my prom dress and 2 80's prom dresses are hanging by the door (respectively) awaiting the semi-formal and masquerade balls. That's right, folks, I'm headed back to government school this very evening. It turned out to be a nice, though uneventful, visit home. I got to mellow out and just relax. It was nice.   Last night, instead of attending any of the numerous parties my dad and I were invited to, we stayed home and watched Finding Nemo. Good times. Then, this morning, Mary and I went shopping like old times. And I fell in love with my car again. It's so much fun driving a stick shift! I bought a pretty little number (a dress, I just really wanted to say "pretty little number) at a closeout price. And then! Farah came over to my house to hang out with me. It was the first time I'd seen her since graduation.   And when I say mega tote, I really mean Mega. This thing's the size of a body bag, literally. It's kind of embarrassing to carry it around, and I feel guilty about all of the extra things I'm taking back with me. Good thing I've got all that extra space!   Oh, and don't tell NC, but I got her a present for her practice room. It's one of those tap lights so she'll have more light when she wants to practice!  Three more weeks of government school. It seems like a short time, but also a long time. I mean, I've already been gone 3 weeks, and that feels like an eternity looking back. Man, I'm really enjoying my summer!   Alright, don't forget to write me emails and send me care packages! (My address is free for the asking!)

      Happy 4th of July!   So, do you remember yesterday's post in which I said, "That just reminds me more of GSW, NC, and the rest of my exclusive gang?"  Well, I was alluding to NC's hatred of patriotic songs, EXCEPT for "God Bless the USA."   You know the words...."And I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free. And I won't forget the men who died and gave their life to me, and I'll proudly STAND UP! Next to you and defend her still today..."   Well, the first week of GS when I was just falling in love with NC and her humorous ways, she told us a story about some concert or whatnot she went to where a little Asian kid stood up and sang the song with such fervor and emotion that it made her cry, and forever secured the song's place in her heart. So just imagine the "Four Muskrats" (NC, in all seriousness, stated that the "Four Musketeers" was taken, leaving us to be called "The Four Muskrats") traipsing about Salem College singing "God Bless the USA" for NC's pleasure. And she has this lovely little arm motion to accompany the "...And I'll proudly stand up!" part, which is probably why I included the exclamation mark. During that first week, that was our favorite song to sing, along with Hillary Duff's "Let the Rain Fall." What strange impressions we must have made...  I must miss my Governor's School friends, eh? I could detail countless other capers, but I don't want to make anyone jealous of my awesome friends.   I'm going to see my brother and his girlfriend's new apartment this afternoon. It's apparently in this really old house built in like 1850 that has been refashioned into self-sustaining apartments. Sounds awesome. And I'll also get to visit with Jake and Jenny's kitten Biscuit. She likes to bite toes.  We named my mom and dad's bird, also. His name shall henceforth be Millville. Pretty funny name. Bertrude was already taken.

      My first full day home has been utterly boring, compared to Governor's School at least. I mean, at GSW they have a wonderful variety of cool seminars and activities to choose from that are intellectually stimulating and fun, and even if you don't want to participate in any of those, there are always cool people around to hang out with.   I wanted to go shopping today, and Mary was forced to cancel, with understandably legitimate reasons. So I went to the grocery store with my dad instead and got food to take back to Governor's School. Popsicles, tuna fish, Wheat Thins, Frappacinos...that sort of thing. And tomorrow is the 4th of July! It's unfortunate that I'm not very patriotic. Damn it. That just reminds me more of GSW, NC and the rest of my exclusive gang.  A few times I've slipped and called Governor's School home. Like at the grocery store. "Jessica, do you want any apples to take back with you?"   "No thanks, Dad, I still have 2 left at home. Oops...I mean Governor's School."   So I guess I'm saying that I'm looking forward to returning. Not that being home totally sucks, I am just enjoying myself at GS.

      I'll be home tomorrow! You can count on me! I'll be home tomorrow, if only in your dreams!  -To be sung to the tune of "I'll be home for Christmas"  So, I just watched a movie, okay so I didn't just watch it, I've eaten dinner since, but anyway, earlier this afternoon I watched a movie entitled "Baraka." Pretty interesting movie. IMDB had this to say about it:  A movie with no conventional plot; merely a collection of expertly photographed scenes. Subject matter has a highly environmental theme.  Back to the movie expert herself, there was no dialogue, just a wonderful juxtaposition of images ranging from rainforests, poverty striken cities, factories, concentration camps, indeginous peoples of Cambodia, chickens, just crazy stuff that drew parallels and a wonderful soundtrack that conveyed emotions just as well as dialogue. Intense.  So, there's another dance tonight...exciting.
