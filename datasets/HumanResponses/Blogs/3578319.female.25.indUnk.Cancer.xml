      I finally got my period today.  *whew*  Thursday night Nadia went to New York.  She had a threesome with Matty B and Jasmine.  It's weird b/c I slept with Matty B when I went to visit her at Vassar this year.  God, that whole crew is so incestual.  I need to stay away from that.  I shouldn't hook up with anyone else in that crew or else it will just get sticky.  Matty B, Nad, and Jasmine left me a funny voice mail tho telling me how much they all loved me.  Matty B has a great spirit.  I wish he wasn't such a slut tho.  What else do you expect from a guy with an 11 inch penis tho?  He loves to spread the love, baby...  Mike also left me a voice mail last night.  He called me "baby" and told me that he is excited to see me and so excited for me to move to Brooklyn so that "he can have someone cool to hang out with if he is invited".  Still not sure whether or not he has a girlfriend.  But, I hope that I do end up hanging out with him this saturday night.  I'd like to see him.  And, it's good that I have my period because now I can't get myself into too much trouble.  I also called Joe last night who was suprised that I called him because he told me that he feels like he always calls me.  He's a sweetie. He told me that he will be moving back to Philly on september 1st, which is the exact day that I will be moving into the new place in Brooklyn.  I'll miss him, but I can NOT stay in Philly.  It's killing my spirit.  Spoke with Dan as well who is temporarily in Florida.  He will be flying back to Philly on sunday.  He wants to take me to this asian Vegan place called "charlies" or something downtown.  I found this very sweet because he is your typical meat eating guy.  God, I wish he was taller.  I am totally going to be forced into hooking up with him just because I like his personality so much.  I'm really not that attracted to him, althought he does have a nice mouth.  He is also very influential in the music industry for a 26 year old which I find very sexy.  He knows his music.    I just realized that three guys (Joe, Dan, and Mike) call me baby right now.  That probably isn't such a good thing. I don't mean to be a player and don't think that I am. The good news is that I'm not actively sleeping with any of them.  I have not slept with Mike or Dan.  And Joe I have slept with because he was my boyfriend.  I'm really only slutty with guys that I know I won't see again.  That may not be the smartest idea.  HHhhmmmm. At least it keeps my slutness a secret from everyone except for my friends.  I guess in that way I really do use guys.  Only guys that I don't know.  I'm a playa.  Another reason for this is the fact that I did end up sleeping with this one guy who really cared about me alot on college and I didn't like him at all.  I think it broke his heart a little bit.  I don't want to do that again.  It made me feel like SHIT.  Tonight is the Simon and Garfunkel concert with Beck. YAY!  Then I was thinking we could go to the 700 Club.  Maybe I will end up running into Michael(friendster) there.  Or maybe not. I'm just really excited to hang out with Beck.  We haven't gone out with each other in over a year.  I also haven't really been out with her and have ever been single, so this should be interesting.  I'll be flirty and find her a nice boy for the night since she is so shy in that aspect.    Hhhmmmm, better get back to work.  First I have to go tinkie and do another poo.

      GGggggrrr. I live on the Main Line out of convienience.  After college I moved to a few places with my boyfriend through out the US, we broke up this past August, so I came back home.  Anyway, I am back here, against my will and am moving to Brooklyn in the end of August which is basically ASAP.  My point being....fuck people who call themselves "mainliners". They have no class.  On my way to work today this guy in a mercedes stopped traffic, got out of his car and proceeded to yell and scream at this old man who had honked at him for cutting him off.  Why?  Why be so angry and mean?  Then, this young mom on a cell phone who was driving an Audi station wagon that no doubt,  her husband can't afford wouldn't let me merge into traffic.  Ugh.  There were more instances that make me feel as if these people have no class just this morning.  It is very easy to distinguish the Nuevo Riche from the Old Money on the main line. Very easy.  I actually feel annoyed at myself just for complaining about them. Like they are drawing me into their "I'm care about the environment because I drink starbucks coffee" world. But they are obnoxious fucks that were not taught any manners and/or forgot their manners along the way somehow.  Anyway - sorry to be so negative.  I'm excited for this weekend.  My best friend from highschool is making the trip here from Brooklyn tomorrow at some point so that we can go see Simon and Garfunkel together.  It should be pretty chill.  The next night I'm driving her back to Brooklyn and hanging out there with her and some other friends from highschool.  I'm moving in with another one of my best friends from highschool who just graduated from Vassar.  She told me the other day "you will be fully inundated with the Vassar lifestyle when we move."  Since then, I've thought about it and have concluded that I'm fine with this.  Most of her Vassar friends live in Brooklyn and not many of my Trinity friends live there...so I know she was speaking the truth.  I do have to be mindful to keep an eye on my substance abuse because it has gotten out of hand before.  And...with the Vassar crowd, it could be easy to fall back into these bad patterns.  Back to this weekend.  I'm supposed to meet up with Mike this saturday in Brooklyn.  Mike is one sketchy mother fucker.  I've told him that to his face.  Not sketchy in the "jail time" sense, I mean sketchy in the "his best friend told my roommate that he has a girlfriend but when I asked Mike he denied it" sense.  He's pretty fucking awsome tho and we always have a great time together.  I honestly feel like he is the male version of me.  The last time we hung out we talked about existentialism and ego-stroke shit like that until I fell asleep.  I woke up to him jerking off in my bed.  We hadn't hooked up before so I couldn't believe that he would take this liberty so early on in our psuedo-relationship.  I was just like "are you kidding, man?"  He told me that it was my fault because I'm "just too sexy" and blew is load.  Ha ha.  I could NOT believe it.  Then as he was drifting off to sleep I was still wondering who the hell he thought he was when he farted.  HA HA!! That was the icing on the nasty cake.  It was greeaaattt.  So, I haven't seen him since, but I agreed to meet up with him again, because he is fun.  I want to say that we won't hook up, however, it may happen.  Def nothing serious.  That jerking off/fart episode simply grossed me out too much to be compliant with any action below the belt advances.  Joe called me last night from California to tell me that he felt like when he was in philly he took for granted "how nice" I was.  That was a very sweet thing to say and I appreciated it.  I then told him that I had to take a preg test last night after work and it (thank God) came out negative.  He was fine with it.  I'm sure that if I was preg he would want me to have it.  I'm not sure what I would do being a 24 year old who still doesn't really know what she's doing or where she's going.  I don't think I'd make a very good mom right now.  Anyway, no point in even thinking about it now. But, I miss Joe.  The exact day that he moves back to Philly I will be moving to Brooklyn.  I don't think it's meant to be between us, however, there is a mutual respect between us that I haven't had with any other relationship.  He's also hella cuddly and very cute.  It's hard not to fall for someone that makes you feel fragile, beautiful and smart.  He's wonderful.  I wish we were a better fit.  We are just too different to have it last forever.  Well, I better get back to work.  BTW - I made a DR.s appt. for next Tuesday.  I'm going to talk to my DR. about introducing adderall to the equation and see what he says.

      sucks.  living with four other people really sucks.  I slept for like 12 hours last night.  The night before that I had gone out and did some crazy shit, so I needed my sleep.  It was so nice, because I came home, ate a little vegan niceness that I whipped up and then retreated to my wonderfully cozy room with red curtains and pale yellow walls.  I sat on my bed and read for a couple of hours with my dog in my lap.  It really was a great night. Fuck drinking, drugs and hooking up.  I had more fun last night then I have had in a while.  It partially may be because I love the book I'm reading.  It's called "A Walk in the Woods" by Bill Bryson.  Bill and one of his friends hiked the Appalacian Trail and it's basically his memoirs from that experience.  It makes me want to go out there and do it myself. But, I won't because I'm too lazy.  Right now, I'm on 150 mlgrms of Effexor a day in order to curb my depression.  I think I need adderall or ritalin also.  I used to have a perscription for dexadrine, but it made me all cracked out.  I was a scary mess.  My roommate and I in college both had perscriptions.  We would sit at our desks, about two feet from one another, smoke cigarette after cigarette and study for hours on end.  She would obsessively pick her nose and put the boogers on the wall next to her and pluck her eyebrows.  I would make sure that my handwritting was PERFECT.  If I made any sort of mistake...it was time to start again and the page would go in the trash.  And these were just notes... I was cracked out.  I like adderall tho.  It doesn't give me any of those crazy side effects.  And, it really controls my ADD.  I like the person that I am when I'm on it.  Now that I have my depression under control thanks to the Effexor and meditation, I can maybe start working on my ADD.    My neck is feeling slightly better. Today I'm going to work on not diving head first into anything.  That'll be my goal.  Waiting anxiously for my period to arrive....yikes.

      I did a swan dive into my couch last night. I jumped right over my friend Eric.  My neck cracked at least half a dozen times.  I can't turn my head very well today. But, it's okay because I get to go home after this long day at my asshole job and cuddle with my mutt.
