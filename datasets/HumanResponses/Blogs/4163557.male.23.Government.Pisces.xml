      Blogging from work: bit naughty. But everyone else has gone home and I have to stay until half five to make up my month's hours, so here I am. Had a long, dull, irrelevant meeting this afternoon made interesting only by the chairs' use of dodgy quasi-poststructuralist arguments against points they couldn't answer. "Ah, but what you're forgetting is, this is a  process , see, not a  structure . It's  non-linear. " Right.  Anyhoo, that's it for now. Back to BEMLI.

      Little to report today, again. John, Neil and I did the  urlLink pub quiz  and lost by seven points. Spent a lot of time at work reading and posting to  urlLink BEMLI , which was fun to the point that being given work to do became a distraction from what I was doing. Which also included playing  urlLink panda golf .  Other fun things on the internet I have discovered recently include: find out where you lie on a two-dimensonal grid of  urlLink political persuasion ; and if you fall somewhere in the south-west corner, check out  urlLink this website .

      Met Tom tonight. We spent a long time talking in abstract terms about sex. Debating the differences between animalistic sex and, er ... "romantic" sex(?) ... or something ... Anyway, it was illuminating. It swiftly became subsumed in a conversation about determinism, free will and fatalism. Personally, I believe wholly in the former, although fatalism (i.e. predictability on a universal scale) is theoretically possible if one were to know the exact positions and motions of every quark, atom, whatever, in the universe to a degree currently impossible ... then, yes, perhaps it would be predictive. The conversation finished, as was apposite, in a discussion about monkeys' sex lives.  I asked Tom's advice about [my friend's wife]'s blog. He says to tell him ... I'm still not sure what to do ... if it were a diary in question, the issue would be less ambiguous. But as it's something available to anyone with internet access, it's a bit different ... a postmodern dilemma ... I realise I've been overdoing the ellipses ... I shall stop attempting to emulate Celine and go to bed.

      Nothing much happened today either. Played ping pong again at lunch, and am playing for our section at work in a competition next month, less because of my amazing skills than a lack of numbers, but it should be fun anyway. And I definitely improved over the two days of playing.  I forgot to add some links to a couple of funny things from the net yesterday. First up is one that Chris sent me, which is the transcript of a radio show featuring  urlLink Will Self and Richard Littlejohn  arguing about their latest novels from a little while ago. The other is a  urlLink left-wing think tank  who seek pragmatic solutions to policy problems and, from what I read, have some good ideas.

      Played table tennis at work at lunch today. It was good fun and I wasn't the worst - hadn't completely forgotten how to play, despite having not done so for about eight years - and hopefully I'll be able to do it every week.  I got a letter from the AHRB and they didn't offer to fund me for the MA. Although I don't care about that much, I was quite insulted because they rated my applicatrion as a 5: "satisfactory application, but not a priority", which is pretty bad on a scale that only goes from 1 to 7.  So I'm not going to UCL next year. Ah well. I'm more interested in learning HTML at the moment than studying more literary theory anyway.  Yesterday's post was a bit serious. That won't happen very often, I'm sure. Been reading more of the Blog though and it's still not looking too great. I hope everything works out for them. Who knows what will happen over the next few weeks.

      An enjoyable weekend. I went to visit Ben and his wife in Oxford. The baby is due in about six weeks, and Ben asked me to be her godfather (or whatever the non-religous equivalent is), which was very flattering and which I agreed to without hesitation. I've never seen the point of buying things for babies but I'm already planning a trip to Mothercare. It was great to see them, and she and I had a long conversation about literature and punctuation, like the English nerds we both are. And Ben and I stayed up drinking wine and chatting until half six in the mornning; and I've had nine hours sleep within the last sixty-four.  But then I googled her blog, as we had been talking about blogging as well, and it put a different slant on the whole thing. It reminded me how complicated (some) people's lives are, and how it's really impossible to know what's going on in them. Unless, of course, they post it on the internet.  I always think of everyone as being as basically happy and "sorted" as I am (mostly, and despite recent events) and it sometimes comes as a shock to find out they aren't. I don't know why this should shock me, given that two friends have been in tears in my company on separate occasions within the last week. (Does my presence inspire negative emotion? Is this a good thing to happen? Hehehe.)  After getting back from Oxford back from Oxford I went to JLT's for dinner, which was fantastic. (John, I know you read this, so remind me to ask you what you cooked those roast potatoes in. Mmmmmmm.)  And now I'm going to get into bed and hopefully be completely unconscious until the Today programme.

      Last night I went out with several of the DH people, some of whom were new. We ended up in O'Neill's in Soho. Rob was off his face and kept trying to start fights with  urlLink  chavs  . Fortunately we were able to intervene and calm people down.  Sophie was in there, which was the reason we went to O'Neill's in the first place. It was good to see her; she was only in the country for tonight before going on to Europe again.  J was a mess too so I brought him back here and he's peacefully asleep on the sofa as Chris and I sit here playing on our laptops as usual.  Going to Oxford later, to see Ben and [his wife].  An  urlLink article  about how the world has gone digital.

      Hangover today. Went out with Eloise last night. We met in the Porterhouse, which serves a range of interesting beers. Then went on, eventually, to  urlLink Kulu Kulu  for sushi. Although according to reports Kulu Kulu is far better than Yo! Sushi, I didn't think it was  that  much greater, although it's certainly better value for money, food-wise. But Yo! is more fun and has a better atmosphere - and you don't get asked to leave at quarter past ten because they're closing.  Anyway I stayed at her (boyfriend's) flat and we drank wine til about 2 in the morning. Then in the morning the "ten minute" walk to Canary Wharf turned out to take 25 and I was half an hour late for work. Fortunately my boss didn't seem to mind too much and there was very little work to do so I spent most of the day on the internet checking out  urlLink laptops .

      I finished reading Murakami's  Wild Sheep Chase  at half three this morning. (Couldn't sleep: first too hot, then too hungry. Spent the day at work in caffeine-fuelled mild anxiety.) It's okay. Like a cross between Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Flann O'Brien. Certainly not as good as  Norwegian Wood.         There are two people and three TV/computer screens on in this room. That's an unhealthy ratio.  It was drizzling when I left the house this morning, and I was slightly damp by the time I reached the tube station. Thought about looking for somewhere to buy an umbrella but didn't bother in the end as I was already running late. Of course, it was hammering down at the other end and so I turned up at work dripping with rainwater and had to spend ten minutes drying myself with a hand-dryer.  Michael Howard gave a  urlLink speech  about crime in Middlesborough today. Pandering to Fathers 4 Justice to try and win votes seems a bit desperate, but I suppose they need to grab votes from wherever they can.     Looking through my list of interests, music tastes, hobbies, etc., on my profile, I realised there are many that I have little knowledge of/am quite unskilled at. Not that I've ever thought there was anything wrong with being a dilettante.  It's often used pejoratively. I shall attempt to reclaim it as a GOOD THING TO BE.

      Realising four cold sausages was an inadequate meal for a healthy young chap like myself, I went out earlier to the supermarket. Having moved fairly recently, my supermarket shopping experience has changed dramatically. I used to stroll down to suburban Sainsbury's in Tooting and often bumped into acquaintances in there, making me feel like  urlLink Jack Gladney . Now, walking uphill (this somehow makes a difference) to Tesco, I know no-one in there; nor am I familiar with the layout of the goods; I wander aimlessly, shopping whimsically. This is how I imagine  urlLink Raoul Duke  would shop.  Well, I did manage to leave the flat yesterday, although public transport was only required for the return journey from Clapham. John and I went looking for a pub recommended to me by a friend at my ex-workplace called the  urlLink Duke of Edinburgh  which had, as he had promised, a fantastic beer garden.  Is the world essentially analogue or digital? I just asked  urlLink Martin , who thinks it is digital. I'm leaning toward that direction myself. He pointed out that quantum mechanics posits matter as discrete, rather than continuous. This is true (I think: I am neither mad nor a liar), but he deflected my argument about wave/particle duality by musing that electrons are neither: they simply behave like one or the other under certain observational constraints, and our failure to appreciate them in reality just shows the limitations of language. Again, I can't disagree with this, but it doesn't answer the question.  A more interesting question might be:  do we  experience  the world as analogue or digital? This would differ between nations, theologies, ages, maybe even sexes, I guess, if you look at it from an essentialist feminist point of view. In the pre-industrial days (we assume) people saw the world through seasons, harvests, natural life rhythms and cycles: Analogue.  I must install Office XP Pro on my laptop now. To be continued.

      Someone introduced me to a website which offers you  urlLink sweets  in exchange for spam today.  Chris is whingeing because I won't cook him anything. I gave him my blessing to finish my bacon off but he's too busy (lazy) to cook. Here's a glimpse of the kind of guy he is. Just now: Radio: "Iraq has reinstated the death penalty". Chris: "Hooray!" Another character trait: Watching football on Sky, with the TV muted, and Radio Five commentary on instead. Sample of Radio Five commentary from the European Championship: "Well, we can see a lot of roads from here. It looks a bit like the M25. Oh, look, someone's just scored..."  I've got to leave the house today. Maybe even go far enough to require the use of public transport.

      Nine and a bit hours later. Made some pasta from scratch. Watched some terrible television:  Liquid Assets  and  Passport to Paradise  stand out as the worst.  Drinking some Stella Artois with Chris. I thought I might be going out "on the town" with  urlLink Neil  tonight, but it seems not.  So, Nadia won Big Brother. Definitely worth investing a lot in her on  urlLink Celebdaq  this week.  I worked out how to pull my photo from my old University website and put it on here.  I may look a bit of a poser, but I was asked to stand in various positions and the University obviously had a preference for 'moody Gwyn' - so that's what ended up on there. In my day-to-day life I tend to smile more than that.

      I've never managed to keep a diary for longer than a couple of weeks. Every time I get to that point and start reading back over what I've written, it always seems inane and embarassing. No doubt this will too, soon enough. It doesn't help that my flatmate is sitting next to me playing online  urlLink poker  on his (superior) laptop and commenting on how pathetic blogging is.  Read an amusing  urlLink article  defending laziness by quoting various historical intellectuals on the  urlLink Guardian  website.  It's another beautiful day. I know this because I sat outside for a couple of minutes smoking a cigarette earlier. I have started reading another Haruki Murakami novel, having just finished  Underground , the collection of witness testimonies from people involved in the Tokyo sarin gas attack of 1995. The religous group who released the gas, Aum Shinrikyo, actually have a  urlLink website . The translation is slightly off, and the site doesn't appear to have been updated in the last four years, but it is worth a look. I think the group are particularly interesting as an example of how any religion  can  be used to justify violence - Buddhism wasn't something I'd ever thought of in that way before.  I have no idea why anyone might be reading this, but, if you are, why not read some  urlLink news , download some excellent  urlLink music  by my friends' band, and wait for the next high-octane installment of this blog. Which, looking at where this day is heading, will probably be within a few hours.
