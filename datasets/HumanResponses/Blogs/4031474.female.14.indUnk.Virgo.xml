            in the land of  dirt and plaster lies an army of a thousand nowhere kids losing ground and falling faster into a life that no one should have to live         we are the people that you hatewe are the bastards that you created (the fucking bastards that you created) a generation with no place a generation of all your sons and daughters behind the fake family image behind the smile of a thousand moms and dads inside the cage that we've been given i see an image of the future that we don't have

      alright ya life sux and if it wasn't for some people there is no way in hell i would still be alive seriously.&nbsp; My friends mean the world to me and if it wasn't for them i have no idea what i would be like today. Especially my baby thug katie shes the best.&nbsp; She nows more about me than anyone could imagine i tell her everythin. And theres a story behind the baby thug thing. Katies mom doesn't really like me bacause we got into a lot of trouble in school and her mom thinks we act like baby thugs together but whatever. right but i love my&nbsp;baby thug so wutever.&nbsp; And chris is one of my best friends. So in general if it wasn't for my friends either me or my mom would kill me. ya so im glad to have friends like them.
