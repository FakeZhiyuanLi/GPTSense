      Okay, so i lied!  I pretended i am going to the provincial job fair, even if i wasn't really assigned.  Sue me if you like, but i think the house is too crowded for me. And my usual quiet mornings are disrupted by rants of my mother.  So, i am going away for a break.  I'll be with my favorite buddy/lover: Mendel.

      If the office is airconditioned, naturally, it is enclosed. If it is enclosed, one sneeze could generate virus. A virus in an enclosed space easily spreads. The virus spreads at 150 km/hr, 27 x7; The virus that spreads starts a chain. Like ebola, but not as worse. Every week someone gets the virus. Unfortunately, i wasn't spared.

      I woke up at the wrong side of the bed.  I'm a such a loser when it comes to hiding money.   Today, i discovered that my dad deliberately went and scavenged into my personal belongings in search of...money. Well, it didn't take him long to find it. Naturally, my reaction is to get pissed. Why? because it's invasion of privacy.  Really,the purpose of me doing so is that i need to save up to buy myself things, shall we say, personal money to buy personal belongings. But that doesn't mean that i'm very shrewd or selfish when it comes to that.  Hangang sa makakaya ko, ibibigay ko naman e.   My mom tried to defend my father saying " it is in this time that you should start giving back what we had given you. "  I got surprised. And i took it in deep.  Wow. Is that really the purpose why she had us go to good schools? So that, in due time, we pay them back? Because, had i known that all along, i would've chosen to go to a public school or somewhere with lower standards, or better yet, gone away at a younger age and forgot about school.  I thought that the whole reason of parents having their kids go to school and finish college is for us to learn to make it on our own. To be able to survive for ourselves and not depend on them, because everyone gets older and weaker, sooner or later, they wouldn't be there for us anymore.  I'm not selfish with money. I'll give them whats due them. I take care of my sister's necessities. Isn't that enough? Wouldn't it been much better or much pleasing if they knew that i did it out of my own will? Isn't it much better that i bring in the groceries every payday than nothing at all? The problem with my parents is that they tend to squeeze out more from what i could really give.  I really didn't like that - the whole "stealing" of my money; the whole invasion of privacy; the whole " it is in this time that you should start giving back what we had given you." And to make things much worse, pretended nothing happened.   I work hard because i have plans for myself.   Later on today, after leaving the house in such a sour mood, their was a tight commotion inside the bus that i was riding on. Apparently, a passenger had complained about the driver's driving skills. Driver takes it bad and hits the passenger in the face. And i had ringside seats to watch  that  boxing match.     *sigh*    Again, i woke up at the wrong side of the bed. Or maybe because its Tuesday.  BAD Tuesday!! *spank* Bad, bad, tuesday!! *spank**spank*

      I couldn't see anything. A faint light from the outside crept up into my window, and only a silhouette of my sister sleeping beside me.   It was quiet and still. And, although, the place was familiar to me, i slowly began wondering if i ever was in the right place.  Suddenly and slowly, the room began to illuminate. Everything was the same. My sister was sound asleep beside me. In front, about a meter or two away, the closets; hangers haging on the closet handlebars; a full-length mirror to the side; and the fan blowing and buzzing a faint sound. But the place seemed unfamiliar. Something was wrong.  something crept up to my body. Even, with enough blankets to cover me, i felt cold. I shivered and tingles of electricity shot up to my body - up and down. Behind me, i felt another body, embracing me and holding me like a lover would. but the more that he held me close, the more i felt cold and suffocated; I couldn't breathe, nor move, nor see the man who was doing this to me.  And then,   I woke up.   I feel my sister shaking me, seeing if i'm okay.    I could feel my heart thump fast and so loudly, it was hard to catch up.      A sigh of relief - it was only a bad dream.                     But it was the same dream that made me sleep again.

      I don't like guys, whom i do business with, who flirt over the phone. For the past week, I have been assigned to find a suitable GY Meal Provider for the employees of the company i work in. Part of the task is to contact restaurants who are willing to cater, well obviously, during the graveyard shift.   Here is an example of that: Guy: "i'm confirming my appointment with your company..that's 10am right?" Me: "Yes." Guy: "Ok, great. Hey, you sound stressed. Do you want me to massage your back?" Me: " NO. im fine." Guy: "Do you drink vitamins?" do you want me to bring you some tomorrow?" Me: "that's thoughtful, but i already have my own. thanks though." Guy: "Are you busy?" Me: "Yes. why?" Guy: "I want to get to know you more"  Me: "Not today, sorry." Guy: "Do you want me to hang up?"   By this time, i'm really ticked off. Of course i want him to hang up. All that emotional blackmail!! Hmp!   Me: "Well, don't get it wrong, i just have deadlines i have to finish. Maybe some other day?" Guy: "Ok, thanks! goodbye!"   Oh, for the record, he's 45 years old. Yuck!

        Guided By Voices   came up with a book.     Oh, i need to get my hands on this. I haven't had any substantial read for 2 months now.   And oh, if you were kind enough, maybe you could buy or lend me the following:  1. The Vinci Code - Dan Brown 2. Main Lines, Blood Feasts & Bad Taste ( A Lester Bangs Reader)- edited by: John Morthland 3. Pyschotic Reaction & Carburetor Dung - Lester Bangs 4. Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs - Chuck Klosterman 5. Let It Blurt (The Lifes & Times of Lester Bangs) - Jim Derogatis   6. The Sound and the Fury - Barney Hoskyns 7. Not Fade Away: A Backstage Pass to 20 years of Rock N' Roll - Ben Fong-Torres and Cameron Crowe; and lastly, 8. 24 Hour Party People - Tony Wilson  (yes, there was a movie shown about this, but because i was penniless and jobless then, i had to let this movie slide)   As you noticed, most of the books are about rock n' roll. Currently, i have this huge fascination with Lester Bangs and the era of rock n' roll were he thrived and lived. I have printed out most of his commentaries and music revues. The guy's passionate and knows his rock n' roll. But i want more.  Oh, Baby, I know there something more to just sitting around and making love to my desktop PC in my usual corporate garb....*sigh*

         At the peak of the sun's scorching heat, i went to paseo center in search of a place to eat. But found 3 pieces of gold, better than eating burger and fries.  In a CD stand, i found:         The Essential Janis Joplin (Columbia/Legacy): a two cd disc for the price of one; 40 digitally remastered classics from one of the greatest folk/rock artists of all time;      The Essential Frank Sintra, The Columbia Years (Columbia/Legacy): 16 songs of big band Big Blue Eyes Classics for the price of a locally produced and sold CD;      When Summer is Gone, Remembering the 60s:a two disc cds for the price of one; a collection of 60s pop music from 40 artists/bands that made it big;          "Finally," i said "something nice to add on to my collection."   I was relieved. At noon time, for me, it felt likle the day wasn't going to end. These were my lifesavers. I had to buy it. I just had to.  I didn't fret. I rushed to the nearest bank to cash a cheque. Segregated money, in terms of, predictions of expenses til the next payday, gimmick money, family contributions, et al. Made sure there was enough for me to get my gems.  Not 5 minutes past, i was back at paseo center, money in hand, anxious to get a hold of my "my precious, my love."  And like a kid to a christmas gift, wide-eyed and drooling, i handed the cash to the sweet clerk and watched her wrap my prized possession carefully.  Oh, how i cheered as soon as she handed me my present!  I rushed back to the office, ate a bit of lunch (it's an important meal, y'know?!), and head back to the office. I must've imagined my hungered CDROM and Windows Media Player for something new and fresh.  But to my disappointment, the damn CDROM wouldn't play my gems. Baaah!!! I would not let it get to me.  Right now, i could say i am the happiest (but only for this day, i suppose)! But then again, i think i was suppose to buy myself    "Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung,"  a book written by Lester Bangs  , from Fully Booked. That slipped off my mind.   To my next paycheck, i shall vow Lester Bangs shall be mine!      Now,stop dreaming, ang get BACK TO WORK!!! *sigh*

           I'm tired. At 9:00am, I feel tired.  I feel like that character from the chemical brother's video (featuring flaming lips), "The Golden Path." A corporate yuppie daydreaming of sunny, blue skies, green grass and haystocks, and hippie friends.  *sigh*  Shirley Manson could not have said it any better  "The trick is to keep breathing."

         Men are assholes. No, not my boyfriend.  I'm talking about SOME guys here in the  office  who are insensitive. No wonder why you don't end up with any decent girl,     and yet i hear you complain about it.  Or maybe my sensitivity has gone overboard?  No, some guys here at the office are just assholes.     Ego-tripping maniacs....ugh!

         I don't understand myself today.  I feel like crying but i don't have tears. I feel my nose is shrinking but it isn't. I feel like writing something but i don't know what. I feel like i have to do something but don't know where to begin.  And maybe, all this is brough about by PMS.      "Jane, it's hard to tell when there's something wrong.."

        It's already 5:30pm, only half an hour til i log out of the office. And the only actual time i have to relax. Funny, because i don't feel relaxed.  What's a lot funnier is that, today, the whole day, i have been running around, trying to man an event which i have organized. It went well, by the way, and just when i was about to congratulate myself, to pat my own back, i receive a call from a relative telling me my dad had been hospitalized.  How ironic.

         It is through songs my emotions are defined. I do not seclude myself to one genre because, sometimes, one genre cannot completelely relay the mood that i have for the moment or another.  And because i am a sucker for music and i am a frustrated musician, i tend to write down excerpts of lyrics of certain songs or bands that depicts exactly how i am feeling for the moment.    Today, i write an excerpt from  The Cure's BloodFlowers Album (2/15/2000) called "Out of this World:"        When we think back to all this and i'm sure we will - me and you, here and now; Will we forget the way it really is, why it feels like this, and how?  And we always have to go, i realize We always have to say goodbye  Always have to go back to real lives but real lives are the reason why We want to live another life We want to feel another time, feel another time... yeah..another time.....

           Dear Someone,  I left you a gift in the hope that you would use it wisely. That you would realize how it meant to me, so that you would take care of it too. That if you wanted something so much, you could have it, but suffer the consequences later on.  It is not in my power to relieve you of that consequence. It will not be at my expense. I am not your keeper.  Get it? Got it? Good.  xoxo, k

          After all the love I felt these past few days, here comes the pain.  I have swollen gums because my wisdom tooth is growing. It’s hard enough to have a tooth pulled once before. Its twice as hard to feel that a tooth is trying to push through your gums. And has three time the excruciating pain of having a root canal.  I can only hope this would be over soon.

        I had a dream last night. I dreamt that somewhere and sometime in our future, elevators (or lifts, as a lot of people would call it) will not only be moving vertically up and down, but diagonally and sideways.  I remember being on a rooftop of some hotel which, by the way, resembles the old apartment-hotel i had stayed in for 4 long years  (Tropicana) , with Mark De Vera and Kitty Almazan(an officemates i've only known 2 months now). Beside that hotel was an even bigger and taller hotel called "i-TOP."    The hotel i-TOP had weird architecture. It was cone-shaped, and the edge seemed to reach the sky.    Mark De Vera was telling me that we should try and see the view from the tip of the i-TOP building. I told him that it was impossible. He claimed that using the elevator, with him manning the lift of course, we could move sideways and diagonally, until we reach the tip of the cone.Well, after a series of refutes, i gave in. We rode the elevator and amazingly, it did move sideways and diagonally. But it trip was cut short. There had been a centralized unit, like a hub, where all is being controlled. The lift ran shut and still, and moved back to the direction of the hotel. The administrators had commanded the hub to bring the lift back to the rooftop.  We were not reprimanded as soon as we touched the ground, but were asked to leave the premises, never to return.  When  I  (because Mark D.V and Kitty A. weren't in that scene anymore) was at the groundfloor, i sat down on the gutter, thinking what i was going to do next. When, from out of nowhere, big ants came crawling over my body. I tried to brush it off me but there was just too many. I was bitten so many times, i took off all my clothes, and started running like crazy.  ***  I don't know what the "tip of the cone" meant or what it means to see the view from there. I don't understand what i meant to have ants crawl all over me, all the more, to take of my clothes and run like crazy.  Good thing it was only a dream.      PS:    Thanks to Christian  (The Mary Walters, Monopond Records)  for the Go Nuts, Donuts T-shirt and Apron!! I love 'em!!

      Yesterday, in the midst of boredom, i got a phone call.  Me: Hello. person:  kat, may ginagawa ka?  Me:  Sino toh?  person:  si holen to.  Me:  uy! dude, wala naman. bakit?  Holen: wanna go out tonight? Me: no cash, man.  di pa ako binabayaran ng pebo ko  Holen: it's alright,  libre kita.  Me: Why? what's up? Holen: i wanna leave the house. Me: Ok!  I froze. But that was the start of a long night of drinking and gripe sessions about everything that is unfortunate in our lives. I won't divulge context of our discussion or how it ended. But i really just wanted to say:  It feels good to vent. For the longest period of time, i could never really say the things i want, and i felt pretentious being around people.  It's primarily the reason why i left my previous webjournal in livejournal.com, it was too crowded for me, it was so hard to be myself. It seemed that i always had to sugarcoat the things i had to say, for the sake of not pissing anyone of.   Now, i have you, i can be myself - i am free of the cares of people, my great escape.

      After his interview, i saw Rommel walk behind him, a bit puzzled, as if to ask what was my business being there. I pointed to him and voluntarily explained "he's a  'friend' ." Rommel smiled and said jokingly  "dami mo palang friends"  while gripping my hands real tight.  I said my goodbyes, however, Rommel dragged me to the other room. What was the matter? Ah, he asked about my friends work habits and was determining if both were fit to work in the kind of industry we were in. However, Rommel wasn't confident about him. He said that he was to nervous, and stuttered, and had to many fillers  ...ah..uhm...ano  and such, that Rommel felt iffy about hiring him. Later on that day, nonchalant as i was, he figured out from the expression in my face that he wasn't going to be let in.    I was frustrated at first, yes. But, later on, i began to worry for him that he may never find what he has been wanting to do for 3 years now.   He apologized as if to say that he did me serious wrong. " Don't be sorry, " i said smiling. I knew that he was feeling down about not getting in, i also felt his frustration and his disappointment. I worried for him but remained strong for him..for us. I had offered to sit down awhile and buy us something to drink - maybe a couple of beers, maybe more, who knows? The point is, i had to do something  so that he can vent about it instead of bottling it up. He refused the bottles of beer but requested to drink rhum and coke instead. I was ammenable to that.  I suggested that we go to his place instead were he is comfortable in, and we could hang out and relax, and maybe, forget this whole day ever happened.  I didn't turn out that way. He was so distraught about it and began thinking what was the reason why people wouldn't take him seriously. I had to be positive for him. later on that night, we had spend time together in silence, watching the clock tick away. And then, it felt cold. He said " Beb, my failure will be the cause of our breakup. "   What was he talking about? I didn't even say such things.  I held him closer to me and embraced him to tight, i wanted to make him feel that i was always going to be there for him, that i wasn't going to leave him.  It was getting late, and he suggested that i leave and go home. I complied. I knew something was wrong, but i couldn't explain what had been so wrong about that day...  I never knew what or felt or understood what he was going through, until that day. And til now, i haven't heard from him at all.

      Mendel and I, along with his brother, Freud, had planned to go to Punta Fuego, a resort located in far out Batangas, to check the scenery. Apparently, Freud happens to be a propertly consultant for LandCo (owners and developers of Punta Fuego).  And so, last saturday, Mendel & I, along with Freud, and two of my bestest friends, Holen and Jason, decided to take the two hour ride along the winding roads and going in through the lush forest of Batangas.  We were toured in two spots: The Peninsula Punta Fuego and Terazzas de Punta Fuego.  The scene was spectacular. Lush Forest, an infinity of sea water, mountains from a distance, the development of the land was fantastic - It was paradise for a mere 2 hour ride. I could go there every weekend if i wanted to.  Along with the spectacular scenery, came also the ostentatious display of property, some owned by the old rich and some nouveaux riches. Huge lots of land, came with houses made up of 3 floors going down to the sea shore, big houses with lawns even.   At the highest peak of the mountain was a house where it is dubbed as the most expensive amongst all because of its 360 degrees view of the pacific ocean. The land cost about a billion, and the construction of the house cost about the same price. It is owned by one of the popular politicians of the Philippines. An Asian royalty, previously attached with one of the local celebrities, bought a 2 blocks of land, approximately about 160 hectares of land.  Do you know how much per sq.m. costs? P8,000. You do the math.  As i was there to witness the bounty of land that was given to the Philippines (sad that not a lot of us knows about it), i was a bit enraged about the idea that is being sold at high prices. Back then, land was free for all, and nature's beauty was meant to be enjoyed by all. Now, you'd have to pay a sum of money to enjoy mother nature.  On the other hand, i had a tinge of envy for the old rich and nouveaux riches because Punta Fuego, as beautiful as it is, was equivalent to money that i don't have. And even in the next 50 years, i would never ever be able to get that kind of money. It was too far-fetched. And even, it was close to reality, it meant that i had to be friends with people who had membership access to those kinds of places.  To make things worse, we were at the beach. Naturally, you bring your swimwear. We were so close to the water, and even smelled the salty breeze of the ocean sea, but was never allowed to swim in it. We were only there for a sight trip...it was the saddest of all the experiences. We took pictures. But that's all it'll ever be, pictures.  I have to erase Punta Fuego from my mind. Maybe, for my birthday, i'll go to Puerto Gallera. Now, that's more like it - the same 2 hour ride, a boat ride, rent a cottage and stay for a weekend, then i am in paradise.

      this is what the test had to say about me:   Wackiness: 80/100 Rationality: 52/100 Constructiveness: 44/100 Leadership: 24/100    You are a WEDF--Wacky Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you a menace to society, depending on how you channel your energies. You chew your fingers and have an addictive personality. Properly guided, you can be enormously productive--otherwise you run amok, stir up trouble, and generally have a hell of a good time.  To your friends, you are a source of relentless entertainment. You often get into trouble, but you almost always find a way out. You are strangely popular and feed off others' energy. You live hard, seize the day, and although your more sober friends would like to see you settled down, you generally have fewer regrets and better memories than they do. Your tenet is that, at the end of the day, one regrets only what one didn't try. You are right.  You could benefit from outside help in balancing your highs and lows. Or perhaps cutting back on the caffeine.    What i have to say about it:   I've always disliked getting into trouble. Thing is, no matter how i try to be discreet, trouble seems to find me. It's a good thing that i'm a big and tall girl, i can get away with fighting esp. with people who seem to be intimidated by my character.  and oh, i don't chew my fingers, that's nasty.    and since i suck when it comes to html codes, try the test by using this address: http://hokev.brinkster.net/quiz/default.asp?quiz=Better+Personality&page=1

      Yesterday, when i went home, i found my mother and my sister complaining about water. Apparently, Maynilad had mistakenly barred our water supply for negligence to pay. However, my mom was able to speak with a representative from Maynilad office and was given instructions to dismantle a part of the waterpipe to take out the plastic used to prevent water from passing through. When i was informed about this, i quickly asked my mom to direct me to our water meter and to tell me how Maynilad maneuevered the water pipes.   Pretty easy if you ask me. All i really needed was a wrench.   This event had happened 5 hours before i even got home. My mother never really thought of a wrench.    Moving on, and since we don't have a wrench, i had to scout for one. The hardware stores are closed at 8 o'clock in the evening. I had to knock on our neighbors doors to borrow one. Incidentally, two guys (drivers) were hanging around their bosses cars, smoking a cigarette. I timidly approached them and asked " Manong, meron ba kayong  wrench?" (i don't know the tagalog name for wrench)They looked at me and immediately inquired my purpose of borrowing one. After having explained the scenario, Manong Joe and Manong Alvin, offered to fix the water pipes for me until there is water problem no more.  Thank Goodness for charms.  Later that night,  urlLink Mendel  and i agreed to meet at Tiananmen in Makati Avenue to talk about our differences. We were in the verge of breaking up. The night was filled with sobs and tears and tissue paper sprawled all over the wooden table. And all i could ever answer to him was "i don't know."     As plain as the nose on my face, where love is the matter, i'm not a quick thinker.

        when, at times, you felt that failed you, did it ever occur to you that i must've tried so hard to get you what you need? when, at times, you feel that i am so far away though i am right next to you, did it ever occur to you that i must be carrying some weight upon myself? Or even ask why? when, at times, you felt that i have neglected you, did it ever occur to you that i was cooking up something special for both of us? when all the blame seems to point at me, did it ever occur to you there are somethings that i left out so that i wouldn't have to blame you?     Yes, i tried all means, but i failed. but i would rather live with the fact that i tried than none at all. Yes, i am going through major changes in my life, that i don't want you to worry about anymore. Also because i know that i have to solve it on my own. Yes, many times, i have cooked up something for us, but were times that i have to throw out these plans straight to the garbage can. Yes, i left out many things in our relationship because i avoided having arguements with you.       Did it ever occur to you that maybe i do these things because  urlLink i love you ?

         Since Monday, i have been out of bed and to the office very early - too early to catch the sun rise even- because of company events that call for a lot of organization.  And finally, last night, i had to give myself a break - i was dead to the world.   Yesterday was also a test of strength and dedication. Why? Ask  urlLink Lila .  Yes,i had been up for longer that 48 hours, without a blink of an eye, i worked. I can't say i'm particularly proud of it. but i'm glad that it is over.  David Blaine once said in an interview "i don't psyche myself to do the things i do. I just do it as if it is the only way to do it, as if there is no other option, as if it is the only way out."   I agree.

         Lately, i have an urge to listen to anything that is pure instrumental but uses a lot of percussion instruments in it.  Zeki Ispeleta, gave me this two cds:             Best of KODO , [Sony Music Entertainment (Japan), 1992] - 8 tracks all with the use of traditional Japanese drums. "Kodo" has two meanings: 1. "heartbeat," as in, the sound of a mother's heartbeat as felt in the womb; or, 2. can be defined as "children of the drum."        Buddha-Bar 3-B "Joy" [manufactured and produced by Anonymous productions, 2001] - 13 tracks of purely percussion instruments by various artists worldwide.           I'm such a happy popper today. And yeah,  urlLink Nityalila Saulo  lent me a CD called  EGYPT . Well, as it is obvious, the music of origin is in Egypt but contains a lot of cultural egyptian songs. One track in the CD features all percussion instruments. I loved it. I still do. Just too bad i have to return it very soon.

      Yesterday, i have been called by the company, particularly my immediate boss, Tina Vibar (HR Officer), to meet with the dean of student affairs for two different schools in the greater Manila.   Naturally, meetings such as these would mean dressing UP, as compared to my usual  tambay  attire (meaning jeans, shirt and sneakers). And that would mean, nicely combed and gelled hair, my pin-striped black long sleeves, black pants, and pointy shoes and other accessories, just enough to make me look like the big cheese in the contact center industry.  And so went the meeting. The turn out? great. love it.  But that's not even the whole punch line.  As much as i wanted to go home and change clothes, i had to go straight to the office for work to finish up reports and to fix a lot of things because of the succession of events that we organize.   Part of the deal was for me to go and check the current job fair at the glorietta activity center sponsored by Manila Bulletin. However, i had to walk a couple of blocks opposite of paseo de roxas to encash a cheque that was supposedly the budget for another event which transpired today, before i could proceed to glorietta.  As i was walking along paseo de roxas, and just before i reach the bank, the unthinkable happened - My Mentos moment - the heel of my right shoe broke!!!  Whatthefuck?!?!   There amidst all the nonchalant people walking alongside, behind, and towards me, paused to see me lose my poise and stumble all over the paseo walkway!!! And to my disgrace, i couldn't take off the heel as it was nailed to the shoe!!  GGHHHHAAADDD!!!  All the poise and grace i had carried along with me throughout the day had left me on that 60 seconds.  I still had a job to do, and the bank was just right there. Why oh why o why did it have to happen to me? Always to me? Crap.  I had no choice. I put on my broken shoe, and tip-toed to Chinabank, careful not to break the rest of the heel anymore and cash the check. I've had enough insult and injury for that afternoon.  After the encashment, instead of proceeding to the job fair, i went to Landmark were i found my savior - Mr. Quickie. I had the heel fixed in a jiffy.  What is the moral lesson? Nothing.  But it is in instances like these, although, is such a turn-off, still requires a lot of patience and cool and quick thinkin, and i needed to project that as if there was nothing wrong. And i thank Assumption College for teaching me that.  The bottomline is, instances such as meetings and presentations are the toughest moments of my job, it is unforseen circumstances such as these, that make me want to wear slippers, if not, sneakers for the rest of my life.  I love my job. *sigh* It is the unpredictability of events that brings all out all the emotions that i have.

      I hate cab drivers who ask for P20 (or more) premium out of the fare you pay for because they claim that there is heavy volume of traffic. And because of this, i have come up with a number of reasons not to give them that premium:  10. "It isn't traffic. I leave very near. There is no traffic going to my place."  9. "I only have the exact fare to get to my place. Could you break P1000 pesos? Its the next bill i have."  8. Give them the exact amount. If they refuse, write down the name of the taxi and the plate number, include the name of the driver, and make sure that they can see you getting the said details. If they ask, tell them that you are going to report them to your dad (or uncle) who works for the MMDA for maltreatment of passengers.  7. They already have a P25 pesos flagdown. Adding P20 more is called abuse.  6.  "Traffic? Eh sa Tuguegarao, walang traffic dun. Ok lang ba na metro?!?!"   5.  "Kung gusto mo, ako nalang magmaneho manong. para di tayo ma-traffic!?!?!"   4.  "Sige ba, plus 20, pero ikaw magbabayad."   3. "It isn't traffic. It's called traffic lights - it was meant to stall vehicles because of an intersection. Otherwise, automobiles would've rammed each other here and there because there is no control."  2. "This isn't traffic?!?! Traffic is when you are in the stuck in the long stretch of C5 or Epiphanio Delos Santos Avenue (or commonly known as EDSA, where there is no traffic light, and yet the is a long line of cars who are waiting to get free."  1.  "Para naman kasing kayo lang yung kumakayod. Nagta-trabaho rin kami at nagbabanat din ng buto! Hindi lang kayo ang may kailangan dumilihensya noh?!?!?!"

      I'm trying so hard not to lose my head today. In the words of Ms. Ria Cejero and Tina Vibar  " I Don't need this SHIT today" .  This week has been a long one. Though, times were i was happy, for most times, i've been controlling myself to stay calm. Its such an effort to stay sane and not let the bad days get to me.  For two days, though not consecutively, it had poured heavy rains especially in the morning. It shouldn't affect me, that's right. But, sometimes, mother natures leaves me flustered with all the silly tricks it plays on me.   I wait outside for a ride to work, not minding the rain. For hours i waited despite getting my attire wet. And, finally, when i get a ride, the rain fucking stops and out comes the sun. All the buses don't stop at the bus stop, 7 times, i say. SEVEN. FUCKING. TIMES. As if i wasn't there!!!!!   For Two days i had that.  And quite frankly, the the last of the two days had to happen today (and just for this week, by the way).  Again, I don't need this SHIT.   All my appointments had been cancelled. To top it all off, one of the clients shouted at me over the phone because of this failure. Apparently, i don't have anyone to blame, except the rain which leaves me helpless, because i can not throw a punch at it, or shout at it (because it'd make me look stupid along South SuperHighway),  for all the stress and the hassle to get to work.   I was in the brink of tears. Why, oh why? oh, why do i feel i'm so unlucky this past week? ggggggggggggggrrrrrrrrrrr...  i'm clenching my fist and i'm typing so forcefully unto this keyboard as if it is my enemy. But it isn't. *sigh*   AGAIN, I DON'T NEED THIS SHIT!!!!  And this will all subside soon, i hope. It's not a good way to celebrate the weekend.

      The Eels album, "souljacker" (September 24, 2001 (UK) March 2002 (US) Label: Dreamworks), is quite a disappointment because of it's second rate pop-rock tunes. Although, it fell off of what i had really expected,  this song has been the source of my insipiration and energy for today:   You don't have a clue, what it is like to be next to you.  I'm here to tell you, that it is good, that it is true.   Chorus:  Birds singing a song, old painT is peeling, this is that fresh that fresh feeling. Words can't be that strong, my heart is realING, this is that fresh, that fresh feeling.  Try, try to forget, what's in the past, tomorrow is here.  Love, orange sky above, lighting your way there's nothing to fear.  (Chorus)   Some people are good, babe in the hood, so pure and so free.  I make a safe bet, you're gonna get, whatever you need.  (Chorus)  That fresh feeling. This is that fresh feeling.

           The fact of the matter is, obviously, there is something wrong with you - seeing how you ask other people for certainty. Because, if you were right, why would you bother asking them?

      Last night, I had a seen a private performance of  urlLink Nityalila Saulo  at her flat, with Punnu Wasu, whose name i've mistaken literally as "puno" (tree), playing the mandolin.  It was a night werein Punnu and Lila (as i fondly call her) set the foundations for some newer songs which, later on, turns itself to music.  Great music really - a concoction of Hindu influences and Folk and blues, creates a style quite different from the others. The songs she sang contain a sense of emotional, social, spiritual awareness, as well as, life experiences that I would not be able to put melodically and lyrically. They also played some of their older songs, though just the two of them, had my hands-up for such a great performance. Yes, i now proclaim myself a fan of Lila (ps: lila, di ako nagpapalakas sayo), after hearing3 songs recorded from Rock Radio gig, downloadable through  urlLink Soundclick.com , i found myself singing "para, para, para, para, para, para, para" over again.  Her musical influences are heard in the way she strums her guitar,  by the voice that she sings with. Mature and Passionate, sensible and witty, and full of life.  For Lila, i give 4 STARS. (5 being the highest)

      My weekend is composed of a concoction of high's and low's. Right now, my head is in a whirl, and still trying to recall the events:  ++ I have to give myself a pat on the back for a very successful Monodog (A Monopond night) at the Ciboney Restaurant last Saturday night. Thank You to everyone who came by. And for those who missed it, well, there's always next time.   ++ Eveyrboyd won. Ciboney sales increased. Monopond gets paid well. I get paid too.  - A fight with my mother. We have had exhanged bitter words to each other. Quite frankly, i'm scared that i might have to move out of the house again because of such conflicts.  -  I didn't get to enjoy the gig as much as i should because of the above mentioned.  But life goes on.
