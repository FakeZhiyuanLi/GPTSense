      My boyfriend, Brandon, called me on monday to wish me a happy birthday. it was very sweet. i think he may be "the one". I know i love him but i'm very confused if i'm in love with him.

      i fell in gym yesterday. i was going after a ball and slid on my knees and one started bleeding real bad. the funny part is i didn't realize it was bleeding until a prepy looked at my knee and went,"Ewwww",and threw up. i couldn't stop laughing.
