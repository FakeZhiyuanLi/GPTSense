      Well, I sold my online Magic cards today and made around $347  Yay!  And it's all tied up in bills!!!  WOOOT!  Also... umm, busy at work... yay.  I miss Brenna :(  Every time I talk to her on the phone I'm both happy and sad... I love talking to her but I miss her much...  It'll be ok though :)  I'd rather it be like this than not at all.

      Well, I just got back from spending my day at Cory's house this weekend.  I got this new game called Munchkin which is a card game that is a parody of a Dungeons and Dragon type RPG game played out with cards.  The point is to get to level 10 first.  The game is quite funny... I laughed quite loudly when Jason had to fight a level 8 Gazebo, especially when it said "You cannot get help to fight, you must face the Gazebo alone"  If you have ever been a DnD or just an RPG player, this parody of a basic dungeon romp will make your day.  I love it.  Also got some Magic in... Jason and I played our league match vs. Cory and Clay.  Because of a huge Arcbound Crusher of mine and a nice little Loxodon Warhammer (and Clay getting mana screwed) me and Jason ripped through them quite easily... but that's luck of the draw for ya :)  And, I'm still missing Brenna... but I guess that should be taken for granted by now.

      Warning, don't go to this link if you are weak of stomach.   urlLink http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/history/2001/candacenewmaker.htm   These people should, in my opinion, be put to death for this.  I'm sorry... if I wrapped up a anyone, much less a child, and made them vomit on themselves, soil themselves, and then suffocate to death, I'd probably be in prison for life...  I think I read that these people got 16 years... I hope their torment from guilt ruins the rest.

      I've been reading the Lego version of the bible... and find it quite amusing.  It really cuts straight to what is said making it easy to understand... but being literal translation it can be funny.  I suggest reading this one:   urlLink CLICK ME!   For some reason, the end really made me laugh.  Edit:  Another good one...   urlLink CLICK ME TOO!

      Weee... I really like Brenna lots... it's like seeing her here was like cement.  It's like... now she has been here I can't stop thinking about her... the cement has dried and I can't see it leaving me any time soon.  I feel she is something about me now.  Gah, that sounds weird eh?  Oh well... I want her to come back already... I miss her lots.  I hope it's possible.  Anywho, if you read this, find this song and listen to it:  "Mad World" by Gary Jules.  I really like it and suggest everyone to hear it once.  Work is still boring... but at least I get to read... I picked up a new book yesterday... Four Past Midnight by Stephen King... which means I'll either like it lots or hate it... but it's big and will take time to finish if I only read it during down time at work (I don't have a lot of that currently cus it's pretty much summer here and that's when the stuff gets busy).  Lately I've been thinking that I'm weird... I really like entertainment and books and stuff based on occult and religious themese (stuff about magic, monsters, devils, the apocolypse, divine workings, etc.) but my outlook on these things in the real world is totally skeptical.  I get the skeptic society e-mail each week and frequently read James Randi's site  urlLink http://www.randi.org .  I guess the weird magic stuff interests me, but I won't just buy into it without proof.  Anyways... that was a random thought.  Ok, lame joke that makes no sense unless you actually say it instead of reading it:  Bear walks into bar.  Deer sitting at bar says "Bear, may I buy you a drink?"  Bear responds  "I would...........like that".  Deer says "Why the big paws?".

      Well... I'm a little late posting this because I was busy living :p  My last night with Brenna was wonderful.  She made me very happy.  I love her much and from what I know she feels the same way.  I'm hoping she can come and visit again soon.  I probably made an ass out of myself somehow... but she still liked me... that's a sign :p  I really do miss her a lot right now.  Lots of stuff makes me think about her.  I hope she doesn't decide I suck any time soon :p  Anyways, I'm gonna make her come down again ASAP... I can do that cus... um, I'm awesome and stuff.  Edit:  I love how the Google Ads at the top of my blog are now advertising something about Health Care Policy... I didn't know my blog related to such important things.

      I really hate it when people ask me if they woke me up at work.  Yeah... I work 3rd shift... I've been doing it almost 2 years now, you'd think I'd figure out how NOT to sleep at night by now.  I have yet to fall asleep on the job, but I have had the "did I wake you up" asked to me at least 100 times.  Or they come up to me at what I consider my afternoon/evening (4 AM) and act like I look sleepy when I know damn well I don't.  I think I just hate people.  And by people I mean everyone that isn't someone close to me.  *BURRRP*

      Well, I had a long night at work.  Had  alot of packets to do.  I work at a condo complex and I have to stuff all these packets for the people arriving to stay in the condo the next day.  Well, we had 48, so that takes about and hour and a half to complete.  Along with answering phone, checking a lady in, moving that lady when she didn't like her condo, and all my other duties, the night was long.  Then I get home and need to run my virus checking software, which took forever and I couldn't talk to Brenna for a long while :(  I spent that time playing Amplitude on my Playstation 2.  For those of you (and by you I mean the imaginary people who are also not reading this) who haven't played that game, basically dots move by on the screen corresponding to one of three buttons.  You push the button when the dot gets to the target area.  If you time it right you play part of a song (by groups like Blink 182, Slipknot, Quarashi, and some other good and shitty music).  If you complete a track it plays by itself for a bit and you can move from drums to like guitar and play the guitar.  The point is to keep the song going.  Anyways, I played 3 songs, and I would say it took me about an hour each to beat (well, I didn't beat the last one, Slipknot is hard).  Now before you say I suck, I am playing on the hardest difficulty... my fingers are now hurting... this game is crazy in how it makes you move your fingers.  I was very proud of myself for knocking two more songs off.  Anyways, after failing on the Slipknot song many times, my computer is finally done and now I can talk to Brenna (which I am doing currently).  So, I am pretty happy... but I am sleepy.  Gah, I wish I didn't have to sleep, or was rich... either would help free up time.  Anyways, sorry for boring post.  I'm gonna go talk to Brenna for a bit and maybe fall asleep after.

      Well, I'm back from work.  It sucks.  Graveyard shift isn't bad, but if I could I wouldn't work.  I would just be rich, you know... without all the bother of earning it.  Pretty boring night... read some at work.  Reading a book for an RPG game called Demon: The Fallen.  It was about big ugly demon guys that are mean and they try to stop the other "good" guys. There was a part in it about a girl being fed Alpo dog food.  Anyways, I got home this morning and played the demo for Guild Wars.  It's the demo they are running at E3 and while E3 is going on, they let anyone at home play the demo too.  Game isn't that bad, especially for the fact there won't be a monthly fee for the MMORPG.  Try it out.  Now I'm talking to Brenna (the girl that loves me... yeah I still don't get it) so I am happy, I missed her.  She's coming to visit this weekend, which will make me happy (or sad if she ends up hating me, I do suck ya know).  Anyways, wish me luck and all.

      You need to see the movie Donnie Darko.  Yeah, I know it sounds like some silly movie about a goth super hero, but it's not at all.  You need to see this movie, then you need to go to and figure out the website for the movie (www.donniedarko.com) and then maybe you'll understand it.  The acting is good, the story is very intruiging and trying to figure it out is the fun part.  Anyways, I'm sure the people that will be reading this are going to be my friends that I'll probably see and tell them to watch it in person (and some of them have seen it already).  But if for some reason you're not my friend or I didn't tell you, go see da movie.  Also, my mother took the Afflictions personality test... she's syphilis (who knew?)

      Well, I'm in a little pain right now cus I'm sick... bah  Oh well  Also... people piss me off... people driving, annoying guests at work, etc.  Oh well, that's ok, stuff is still good... Brenna still loves me and that makes me happy.  Our new Magic league started up and we got 6 people this time... will I dominate again??? Probably not... I already lost twice to Clay... but I'll do my best.  Anyway, I'm going back to talking to Brenna, because she's awesome and I love her.

I had a lady tell me her comforter has vomit on it... but it doesn't end there, she just HAD to explain that her grand daughter got sick on crab legs... and then she had to explain how it happened and then reiterate that it was crab legs.  Bah  Then this other annoying call RIGHT as I was leaving took forever and I think the guy was trying to get a free night... but he was just being a total cockbite.  Anywho... I'm home now and talking to Brenna, so I am happy.  weeeeee

If you like mummies, Elvis, retirement homes, or JFK conspiracies, you should see this movie.  Now I'm talking to Brenna so I must go... (she's wonderful btw).

      Well, I'm playing Anarchy Online again.  They had a good special to start playing again so I signed me up and I started an account for Brenna too.  I really like playing with her... it makes it worth it.  It's good to have something to do together.  I'm not sure how much she likes the game yet... but she doesn't seem to hate it (yet).  Jason started playing again too so we might be able to play with him as well, so that's another bonus.  Anywho, work is still normally boring... nothing else is going on.
