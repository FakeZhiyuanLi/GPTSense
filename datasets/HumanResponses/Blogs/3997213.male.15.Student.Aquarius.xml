      It was a slow day. Mom treated my aunt to breakfast at Ammenities Cafe so Riley and I came along. For the reference, I had a sasauage and cheese bagel. Riley had a cupcake. Perfect for a toddler in the morning. Yum! It was hot so I came home and went up on the pool deck to read "The Good Earth." That book is so depressing at times so I got my suit on, jumped in the pool, and floated around in a tube...again! Man, I love doing that. It's such a comfortable float. So I pretty much spent the day out back and in my room. It was such a quiet day. Dad was home doing work around the house and Rachel was at cheer camp. Reid was a lazy bum from the sleepover he just had. I was the only energized one in the house for a change. I won't be writing next until Monday. We're leaving for Ocean City, Maryland tomorrow night to visit some cousins and Rachel is spending like two weeks there. We're dropping her off. The house will be so quiet without her and you know what. I think I'm gonna like it.

      Well, I didn't get to write yesterday. I couldn't get on the internet at all. The stupid cable box is so unreliable. So to sum up the day, I got a haircut, went to Barnes and Noble to buy Pendragon, had gymnastics, and lost my Barnes and Noble gift card. (I figure I dropped it walking out of the store)  But today was good. Nana was able to come by and watch Riley so I didn't have to do it. It was a relief for once. We got Burger King around lunch time. Reid HAD to have chicken nuggets from there even though I wanted Wendy's. He always gets his way and now I sound like a brat. I came back and went in the pool. Actually, I floated around the pool in a tube. I didn't feel like going in. It was cold from all the rain so I drifted around and got a good tan.  Before that I made some corrections on my history report (Thank you mom!) and was able to read 3 chapters in "The Good Earth." It took me the same amount of time to read 1 chapter in Jane Eyre. This book will probably be much better. Speaking of books, I stayed up pretty late last night reading Pendragon. It's the only time I can get. In the daytime, I make myself read books for school.  So I had gymnastics tonight at 5 and got out at 7. I came home and watched Big Brother 5. Did I mention how much I love that show and how I want to be on it when I turn 21? Well I do. We went over to Kohls afterwards at 9:00 at night. Mom had a 10 dollar off coupon and had to use it before it got too late and I needed to get a new watch. So, we ran out with Riley and Rachel (Dad, Reid, and his friend John went over to my Uncle John's to see his boat) I picked out a nice new watch. And the best part about it is the blue light. Yes the shiny shiny blue light that glows in the dark is great!

      It's weird waking up to an empty house. I don't really like the feeling either. Mom left for work in the morning and, surprisingly, I didn't hear her go. Rachel came running into my room to tell me to pick up the phone that was ringing. By the time I rolled over and got to the top of the stairs the phone stopped so I trudged my way back to bed only to lay there for a couple of minutes. I didn't hear much of Riley for the first half hour or so. Rachel had her up in mom's bedroom and they were watching TV. I stayed downstairs.  Reid had drums at like 10:30 so mom was coming home to pick him up. Here's where we had our major problem of the day. I'm going to describe it exactly as it happened. I decided to play a video game. No one was around because Rach was upstairs with Riley and Reid was eating breakfast. It seemed a perfect time to play the gamecube and I saw nothing wrong with it. So, I'm sitting there minding my own business, having fun when Reid goes over to the front door and opens it. "Reid why do you need the front door open?" "Mom will be home soon so I'm just gonna leave it open so I'll be ready to walk out." I said okay and continued with what I was doing. I didn't really care. The door open didn't bother me too much. But it DID bother Rachel. She came down at that EXACT moment and this was where things got ugly. You have to understand. Rachel and Reid are like the cat and dog in the house. They don't get along whatsoever. WHATSOVER! So, naturally, she had an objection to Reid opening the door.  "Someone could just walk right into the house Reid! Mom wants the door closed!" Reid fired back, "Rachel! It's only 10 minutes mom will be open soon." I sat minding my own business, twidling my thumbs, which was my one big error. There was something I should have done but didn't. It may sound silly, it may sound adultish, but I should have sent them to their rooms. It works every time yet why didn't I think of this them?? To sum it up, the door opened and closed about 6 or 7 times. Reid opened it. Rachel closed it. Reid opened it. Rachel closed it. On and on and on it went and meanwhile I'm going back and forth between sides trying to get one of them to give in. Of course that's impossible though. They don't give in. It came down to Reid losing his temper and pining Rachel against the wall. He yelled in her face and went all "animal" like on her. Man, I can so see this kid getting into trouble. He loses his temper and it's not pretty. Rachel started crying and came over to me telling me to do something. Riley sat and took it all in. I sat and played my game. WRONG MOVE! Ironically, mom called at that moment and they both yelled what happend over the phone. That's when I knew it was GAME OVER for me. Sure enough, I got it from mom. Yes. I bow my head in shame but I think I learned my lesson. When in doubt, send them to their room.&nbsp;  So, that was the "meat" of the day. We ran to the credit union and went over to Nana's. Mom and Dad were going to this Titanic Exabition thingy so we stayed at Nana's. We was my favorite dinner, spaghetti and meatballs. I reserved my copy of Pendragon #5 at Barnes and Noble so I'm gonna go get it tomorrow. I watched Big Brother at 9 even though I had to miss the first 20 minutes of it on the way home from nana's. I got gymnastics tomorrow too.  Well, I'm done now for the night. I'll be writing again tomorrow. I'm starting to like this blog. It's funny because I'm slowly growing accustomed to it. I didn't think I would continue it at first.  But now, I think it's safe to say that you will be seeing a lot more blog from me from now on. Life can&nbsp;only gets more interesting from here.

      Good day today.&nbsp;I slept in nicely and got a quiet house as mom took Reid to drums. Riley went too. Rachel was here but she wasn't bothering me. It's nice every once and a while to be able to enjoy some quiet time even if it was only about 45 minutes and, mind you, I spent that time doing homework. I spend a lot of my time now doing homework. Maybe I'm obessing a bit too much over it because I can't remember the last time I was able to play a video game without having a guilty conscience. Seriously, it's a pain in the butt. Do you know how much I would love to just read a book of MY choice. Pendragon #5 comes out soon and it's only my favoritest book series in the world. I think I need to reward myself and get it. But that doesn't mean I can forget about "The Good Earth" and "One&nbsp;Day in the Life of Ivan Denishovich." They have to get read too. Ah I'm rambling now. I finished my history report day. It is such a relief to have it out of the way. I used a secret method while writing it though. I called it "pacing myself." I would write a sentence or too, go onto the pendragon website, talk a bit there, go back, write a sentence or two and I continued this process until it got done. It wasn't distracting. It helped me stay focused on my assignment strangley... Rachel had a friend come over today along with the twins. For some odd reason, she found it necasarry to show them my bedroom. 0_0 I kinda shrugged her off in front of her friends and played the part of tough and&nbsp;superior older brother. It's funny watching her friends look around my room. It's even funnier to see them nervous around me. Ahahah it's fun being the oldest. I love the power...

      I had hotdog day today. We went over at around 10:15 a.m. and I stress the A.M. I didn't need the sleep anyway though. I get enough of it. I'm not complaining.  So anyway hotdog day was, in&nbsp;a word, hotdogfull :) or hotdogish or whatever you want to call it. The point is I'm a bit sick of the dogs. Yeah, you know&nbsp;you've had enough&nbsp;when the smell of hotdogs stick to your nostrils like... like well I don't have the energy right now to tell you what it's like but it's not pleasent. Give me a break here. It's 12:30 at night (er in the morning) You see my thoughts don't run too well after a certain hour so please excuse me if there are any grammer and spelling "don'ts". ( Alright. I saw Anchorman tonight. Chris, Greg, and I went. Pretty funny movie actually. I laughed my hotdog off (ouch that don't sound right! I wonder where I got that idea from though?! Cough Cough) Excuse me. I laughed my tail off. The movie was really funny!  Oh yeah and how can I forget? I FINISHED JANE EYRE!! About time too Mr. Ryguy... (Darnit I'm talking to myself now...) Wohoo that's enough for me tonight. I think I'm a little over tired. Man do I ever need some sleep. Did I say that I need to get more sleep? Honestly...

      It's Saturday. But the weekends don't matter to me anymore anyway. It's summer. Every day is a weekend. So anyway, mom was out at yard sales like always. She picked up a bunch of Rugrats stuff for Riley. She loved that. Rachel had cheer camp and dad was out working on the lawn. I didn't do much really.&nbsp;I went in the pool for like 15 minutes but it was so cold for some reason. We went to Target after that. Riley spilled her bag of m&m's ALL over the floor at the register. (It's not the first time) I had to get down on my hands and knees in the middle of the store and pick up her m's. Real funny.  Dad lit a fire in our fire pit out back but I wasn't there long. I was working on a CD for Rachel. She wanted to buy the Usher Cd but I told her to save her money (correction: mom's money) and I made it for her. She was pretty happy and I was pretty happy that I was able to do the whole thing in a couple hours. (New record for me) Then she wouldn't stop playing "Confessions". Oh how I have grown sick of that song...and Usher. Big Brother came on at 9:00; watched that. I might have to work Hotdog day tomorrow for the adult softball league if it doesn't rain. I don't care either way. I'll also be done reading Jane Eyre tomorrow for school. I have about 3 chapters left. That's pretty exciting. I guess...

      I had every intention to work on my history project today. It's due next week and I'm just about done plus what better day to work on it than a rainy one.&nbsp;Today was perfect. We weren't going anywhere, the house was pretty quiet, and it was raining.&nbsp;Sounds great but wait, this is reality.&nbsp;In reality, things don't always work out the way they were meant to be. You guessed it. I did squat on my report. Yes procrastinator was written all over my face today but I obviously never looked in the mirror considering I went the whole day seemingly oblivous to my homework. Oh well. I'll get it done. So, as I was saying, it rained all day if you didn't the count the hour or so in between. I&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;to mom talking on the phone. I always said she's a loud talker on the phone but it&nbsp;just seems so much louder in the morning. Reid slept in later than normal and Rachel and her friend were in the play room. Mom made some awesome french toast. The morning dragged on. I lounged around in pajama pants until mom announced the possibility of us going out to lunch with Aunt Debbie.&nbsp; This was the hectic part of the day. See, you have to understand that Reid is very picky with his chicken. He orders chicken at basically every restaurant and I assume that after ordering the meal at least 25-50 times, you start to get very "weird" about the chicken you eat. He likes Friendlies. We were just at Friendlies and weren't about to go again today. Uh here is where we had our problem. Reid was grumpy and tired. He wanted Friendlies and nothing else. Personally, I didn't care where the heck we ate but, eventually (against what Reid wanted)&nbsp;the choices were narrowed down to Stewarts Root Beer and Wendys. To make a long story short, we went to Stewarts but with a lot of hassle getting out the door. Riley was fussy and needed a nap so she made everything complicated and stressful with her crying. That was the last thing mom needed. We picked up Aunt Debbie and went out in the pouring rain. Very pouring rain! Stewarts was good. I had the best California Chesseburger EVER. Riley slept in her seat.  We came home and jumped in the pool in the rain. Wow that is fun. Reid had soccer camp and I was staying here with Rachel. Her friend had gone home. Mom and Dad went to watch Reid. The 2 hours or so we were here was very boring. I watched TV. Period. TV gets very boring after a while especially when it's near 8:30 at night, you're home alone, and have yet to eat dinner. We had pizza from East Ridge at 9:15 and it was anything but peaceful. It was a typical family dinner where everyone is rammy from being indoors all day. You can imagine.

      I woke up to watch Riley. My grandmother couldn't make it to watch her so that left me. Reid had drum lessons and Rachel had field hockey camp. Mom was at work. we watched Dora the Explorer and her Pirate Adventure. Oh how I love that movie! Reid came home, Rachel went to stay with our cousin Caila and mom came home to take us to Sam's. We had to get hot dog buns for Hotdog day on Sunday. It's for the township's adult softball team and I usually help with my mom. But wait a second. JUST going to Sam's sounds way too easy. No way. Mom needed to stop and get a replacement glass for our lampost. Dad knocked it out mowing the lawn. Typical. Anyway, to make it short, we ended up going to THREE different glass places (never knew there were so many) and not one place could fix it. Of course. Everyting always has to be complicated. Sam's wasn't bad. The sample ladies were there, never fail.  We came home from Sam's, I had to get to gymnastics. Reid had to get to soccer camp and Rachel was having a friend sleep over. I went in the pool for about an hour then got ready to go to the gym. Once again, that sounds way too easy. Riley had to go and color on the carpet. Oh boy! Mom was mad. I think it's still there too. We tried vinegar and it kind of got most of it off. Still visible though.  Gymnastics was tiring. Worked my butt off on the pommel horse, rings, and vault and I'm suffering now. I think I pulled my shoulder on the rings doing inlocates. Ouch.  Dad picked me up and I came home to watch Big Brother at 8:00. I love that show! Lori was evicted. Drew won HoH.  Now I'm watching Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen with my sister and her friend. Lindsey Lohan is way better than Hilary Duff!

      First time with one of these things. Don't know if I'm gonna continue it. I only wanted to do it to put up some pictures but I'm having some difficulty with that. I don't know. It's 11:50 at night. No time to do any of this now...  I might decide to continue this tomorrow.

      I slept like a rock last night. Maybe it was because I went to bed kinda early for a change but I woke up at around 10:30 without even trying. That's unusual for me. I'm normally up around 9:00 or so. So yeah it felt good. We went to Friendlies with my nana for lunch. She's home from the hospital and it's good to see her back. I had a cheeseburger and then chocolate ice cream with gummy bears. Man, I couldn't feel my stomach after that. I think I gained some weight, which is a good thing. I could use a few pounds here and there. I was on the computer for awhile when we got home then I went outside to the pool and trampoline. It wasn't a particulary exciting day but like I said, it's summer. The days will get more interesting when school starts. I'll probably also have a lot to talk about when we come back from Seaside next week. We're leaving this coming Monday and coming back Thursday. It's not as long as originally planned but we're planning on going to Hershey park in the fall. That will be fun. Oh hershey chocolate. My stomach is groaning at the thought. That's what 5 big scoops of chocolate ice cream right before you get on the computer will do to you.

      It was Thursday so I watched Riley while mom went to work. I'm not going to bore anyone by going on about it. I feel like I say this often. I don't mind watching her. It's not a hard job at all if you can even consider it a job. It's more like something normal. So there was nothing special today. My throat is kinda sore now and so are my ears. Yeah, my ears hurt and I don't know why. Actually, I do know why. I went in the pool earlier and never got the water out of my ears. 0_0 I made Rachel and her friend a CD today. It took a chunk out of my time but it was worth it. They were pretty excited and I enjoy seeing they're faces of surprise. (I make the real deal you know?) Plus it gives me something to do that is fun.  No injuries at gymnastics tonight. Only some red marks on my stomach from the strap belt which pinced me. My leg is bruised and hurting a lot. Hopefully, I'll be over it at the end of this week because we're going to Seaside on Monday of next week. That will be a good week but we were supposed to go with my grandparents. Now it looks like they can't make it. It won't be the same without them. The olymics are also on that week. I'll have to remember to watch them in the moTEL. You know, that word is funny when you say it like that. It sounds like Mo tell.

      So I didn't write anything yesterday. There was nothing to say because I stayed around the house all day and ate candy. (It wasn't as much as the day before though) Anyway, today was different. I woke up craving a chocolate donut knowing we had a box of them in the kitchen. I ate one for breakfast, turned around an hour or so later, and they're gone. Things go fast around here. The motto: If you don't get it while you can, you'll never get it. In other words, you snooze you looze. Now how true is that? Reid had a friend over again like every other day. They go and climb trees. Isn't that exciting? Mom took us to Toys'R Us because she had to pick up a few things for Westampton Day and I bought a new playstation game. We went to the dollar store after that for a few more things and I got some stuff there. Dollar stores are funny. I had gymnastics at 5:00 but before that I jumped in the pool. It was cold thanks to all this darn rain so I wasn't in long. I went on the computer for a bit and that was when time flew by. I looked at the clock and had to be out the door in 5 minutes for gymnastics. I hate it when that happens. It turns out, I would have saved myself a lot of pain if I didn't go. I'm not saying that I DON'T want to go anymore. Otherwise, I wouldn't have these bruises on my arms right now. I did a handstand on those parrell bars and fell forwards over onto my legs and arms. It hurt. It was embarressing. It left a nasty pain. My arms are all red but they don't hurt too much. I'm proud of myself. I'll have you know I only cried for an hour. ;)

      I didn't do anything special today and I can honestly say that. It was a perfect example of a lazy summer day. Reid had a friend over and Rachel biked around and went to cheer camp. Mom took Riley to the playground (that's her new thing) and I stayed home. It was a nice day so I was outside for a while. When I wasn't, I kept eating candy, which I had a huge craving for ALL day. I was constantly back and forth to the cabinet grabing hand fulls of Swedish Fish and Sour Patch Kids. Then I ate some blueberrys. At least that was healthy. I had gymnastics tonight at 7:00 and yeah it was the usual. Hopefully, tomorrow will be more interesting because I'm tired of writing about nothing. We're going to Seaside hopefully next week which will be fun and I've got to finish my summer books. I read a bit of the Good Earth today. One word for the book. Blah

      I remember the title of a book I read once. It was called Absolutely Normal Chaos by Sharron Creech. Though the book itself doesn't have much relevance to our life, I think the title does. Normal chaos. That's the way it was around here today when Rachel came back. It was like all of a sudden the house grew louder and tension mounted. Rachel and Reid started it but like I said, it's normal. They had arguments over the Sims and for some reason it seemed to affect the whole house. I noticed it today on the way home from visiting Nana in the hospital. Rachel and Reid fight in the fan and it makes everyone else edgy. Know what I mean? It was like a dark cloud that once it affected one area, it spread and hit everyone else...except me that is. I sat back and kept my cool, staying out of stuff as best as possible. When we got home, I headed out the backdoor and got away from it all until Reid followed me. I think the fresh air did wonders for everyone because the tension went down from there. That is until it was time for dinner. I don't need to go into detail here though. It was a normal dinner. It was the absolutely normal chaos dinner that we all have grown to know and live with.

      I didn't do anything too special today. Mom took Riley and I with her to the hospital so we didn't have to stay around the house and we got to visit my nana again. I have to admit it was better than staying home. We were there for a while while Reid was at a friend's house, we left then were back again tonight. So overall not a very eventful day. But I feel like typing tonight so I'll describe in more detail our visit to Maryland since we're not all going to pick Rachel up tomorrow. Just Dad is going. It actually was pretty interesting and it's a shame I didn't feel like talking about it the night we were back. We left on Saturday around 6:30. Rachel had cheer camp that whole day so that's why we left that late. Actually, it would have been later if Rachel had gone to her teacher's wedding that was originally scheduled. I got a visit from Ed earlier that day whom I hadn't seen since school got out. I knew he would find me eventually. We took a walk around the block with Katy. It was a fun time. We all piled into the van about an hour or so later (after getting Wendy's for lunch that is) and hit the road. But that sounds way too cut and dry for our family. Nope there had to be some excitement thrown in there and, yeah you guessed it, it dealt with Rachel and Reid. Not that it's surprising but Reid found it neccasary to tease Rachel with a bucket of worms that was sitting behind her. Dad was taking them for fishing. Of course, she freaked and flew out of the back of the van screaming. I sat there laughing. But c'mon! You have to laugh about it. Besides, she would have found out some time. Eventually, we got out of the driveway, which was by no means easy. Rachel and Reid started their bickering before we could get out of the neighborhood. They fought over who had more leg room. (Personally I think Rachel did but I didn't say anything.) Good thing too because I hate getting in the middle of their "battles." I simply loaded on the headphones, got out a book, and pretended nothing was wrong. Two and a half hours later, we were there. Unbeknownst to me, I was missing Big Brother. We settled in at the house and arranged where we would be sleeping. Riley warmed up quickly. She was running around without a diaper. Reid was amused by a dart board and Rachel went off with Holly. I was in the middle of it all like always. The next day we planned on going to the beach. Rachel and Holly were going to a birthday party and dad and my uncle were going golfing. We had an open day and beach seemed perfect. But then, like a sign for the day ahead, it started to rain. We hoped it would just pass over but it never did. One could say that it stayed over because the rain never ceased. It stayed over us all day and ruined all plans for the beach. Naturally, when it rains one may go to the movies so that is what we considered. To make a long and complicated story short, we never went to a movie. Instead we went to Walmart. Yeah that's right. We went to Walmart. It was the wackiest Walmart I've ever been to. I've never seen so many people jam packed into one store like that and it was definately weird. Originally, we went to go get some "dinnas" for Riley (we forgot em at home) and we were gonna pick up a few things. We ended up buying a coloring book for Riley, a boogeyboard for Reid, some pool goggles for me, pop tarts, and cheerleading shoes for Rachel. Meanwhile outside the sky is turning dark. We didn't know that. If we did I bet we would have been outta there a lot faster cause the storm was wicked. So here we are. We got all we need to buy and we're going to the check out line. Mom says we can go hit the outlet stores now and then go back to the house. We're walking to the register when we hear thunder. I'm talking about thunder thunder cause this was loud! One lady screamed which was pretty funny. Mom held her ears with Riley. I chuckled to myself. Now the only thing left was to get to the van with the groceries and make it back to the house. The only problem with that is mom is scared of the lightning yet she is the only one who can drive the van. I waited with Riley and Reid in the little foyer area of Walmart while mom went to bring the van up. Me, being level headed and calm, assured her that it would be fine and I told her I would do it if I could drive. (I would too. I don't mind the lightning.) Obviously, we got back to the house in one piece and we never went to the outlets. I didn't mind. That rain was pretty intense. There's no way we would have made it to the rest of the stores. Score one for me for suggesting to skip it. Later that night, we rented Along Came Polly on On Demand and we had S'mores on a s'more maker. Holly filed my nails and made em all nice and shiny. It was a new experience, I must say. Bedtime came. We left the next morning and left Rachel there. The ride home was easy. I slept the last half hour or so and Riley and Reid slept practically the whole time. It was quiet. There were no Rachel and Reid fights. Dad's going to pick her up tomorrow and he'll stay a night there. I'm expecting the house to become a little louder by the end of the week now. Rachel will be back and everything will go back to normal. Well, everything will be normal enough for us anyway. For anyone else, it would be crazy.

      Just call me Riley's babysitter. Call me the house keeper. Call me a big brother because I'm getting really accustomed to watching Riley. I even found it in me to clean the house and do the dishes today. See, mom had to take Reid to drums at 10:15 and I ended up watching Riley until 1:30. Mom went over to the hospital to see my nana after Reid's lesson. I cleaned the rooms, made the beds, did the dishes, made Riley lunch, and I tell you I was thinking, only THINKING, about vaccuming and sweeping the floor. (Don't worrry. I don't think I would go that far) But, overall, it paid off. Mom came home to a clean house and a not-so-clean-wet-diaper Riley. (I knew I was forgetting something!) When I got my break, I went up to my computer and played a computer game. Oh yeah. Did I mention that while I was being perfect son and cleaning Reid sat on his butt and played on the downstairs computer. I don't think he even moved until the 15 minutes before mom arrived and that was because he knew he had to clean up the clothes in his room. I had gymnastics at 5:00. My hands were bleeding after I ripped em open on the bar. So I got to relax the last 5 minutes of practice. It felt good. We went straight over to Virtua hospital after that to visit my nana. Here I am with dried up blood and chalk on my hand (Predominately the right hand) walking through a hospital. Not that I really cared, but it was uncomfortable. Anyway, we gave her a visit. Big Brother came on at 8:00 and I missed the first 45 minutes of it. That's okay though. I got all the details at the website. So that about wraps up my day. Who knows what I'll end up doing tomorrow but I can tell you that watching Riley for a while is definately up there on the possibilities list.

      It was such a nice day outside today. Too bad I was only out there for about an hour. I think I wasted it (on the computer) because now all it's doing is raining. I just want some hot days. The only reason I was in today was because well I decided to reinstall my Sims games so I loaded my laptop with the Sims and some expansions. It's been forever since I played that game and I'm surprised I'm back into it. Only problem is that it's so addicting that you end up wasting your day away in front of the computer screen. Sad isn't it? So, I had gymnastics tonight too. There's not too much to say about it. I managed to jump in the pool earlier and it was really warm. It was like 84 degrees. Nice. Reid brought home a drum set from my uncle. This is going to be a pain. I can hear it coming now and I have the feeling it will be loud. As long as I keep my bedroom door shut I should be fine. Rachel is still in Maryland and we're going to pick her up at the end of the week. I've given some thought to me describing the trip in more detail. I didn't really do it justice when I came back. You can tell from the vauge entry a couple days ago. There actually was a lot more to the trip than just rain so I'll describe it on the weekend after we pick up Rachel. That way, I can include the end as well. (Cause we still have to go back one more time you know!) I'm surprised at how non eventful these days are when Rach isn't here. Normally, we would be running her around but now the house seems so much more.....quiet. I know I've repeated this over and over but it's unusual. I've come to the conclusion that this time must be known as "still." Let's just see how long this lasts.

      Wow! My legs are killing me today. It must be something from gymnastics last night and now it hurts to walk down the stairs. Luckly, it wasn't a busy day. I had to watch Riley while mom went to work from 9:00 to 1:00. My nana is pretty sick so I might be watching Riley a little more often now. Not that I mind watching her though. She's may be a handful (getting into chocolate and throwing the remote across the room) but it's not too bad. At least mom comes home with Burger King. That's a good reward. I had a whopper junior today. It was free from the Spiderman scratch off game. Normally I eat a whopper and a medium fry but I ate Chinese food left over from yesterday so I was kinda full. Reid and Riley fell asleep today so I got to play a video game for a while. It was nice being able to play a game without Reid whining to watch Cartoon Network. That's the only thing he watches. I'm serious. I don't know why we're paying for these other channels when the only thing on is Nickolodean and Cartoon Network. Urgh! Sometimes it makes me mad cause he expects me to do the same. Sorry but I like some variety in my shows.

      Got back from Maryland today around 2:30 in the afternoon. To be honest, I don't feel like describing the trip. There's not really any point. It rained the whole time we were there so we didn't get to go to the beach. That's about it. We stayed around the house. I'm really tired now. I had gymnastics tonight at 7 and my hands are killing me. I ripped the side of my thumb on the high bar. I came home from the ride today and went straight to my computer here. I think I was on around 3 hours and before I knew it we ordered Chinese food (I had that chicken stuff) then I headed off to gymnastics. So what I'm trying to say is the day went fast. Good thing too. I can't wait to sleep in my own bed. The house will be quiet. Rachel is in Maryland and Reid is down the street at a friends. I love the quietness!
