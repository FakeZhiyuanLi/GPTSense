        This is my indept version of My Song - since i know a lot of u out there want to know what i was thinking when i wrote my poems and stories - so i'm starting with the first one i posted. NOTE: When this poem was written, it was supposed to be an exageration of today's world. Wat this world might become (keep that in mind)            My Song       Blinded by Imaginary Light   - The prase Imaginary Light - used alot in my poem - means something lyk this: If light is fake (and light allows you to see everything) then what is real (since this "fake light" is blinding you, and showing you the world wrongly - it is making it seem lyk the world is wonderful - but really, their is deceit and lies and trachory...This "fake light" is showing a "fake world". I hope that kinda helps you understand my description of "imaginary light" Remember..."If light if fake, than what if real?"    Forged from A child’s laughter And a burning tongue of Hate,     -  The imaginary light involves innocence "a child's laughter" (I used somthing lyk innocence because the "fake light" wants you to think it is real) and something evil - here the phrase "a burning tongue of hate" could mean an acual tongue saying horrible stuff - or could be thought of more as fire, lyk a tongue of flame, something that consumes everything in it's path - as Hate so offten does...     Who is to blame For this misinterpretation Of right And wrong?     -  Basically, this means that the world turned into a place where being bad looks good, or it is ok to get your vengance, and even on more or less extreme levels. And it is asking "Who started this? Why is that allowed?"...      This is my song     - This is where the peom gets it's name. I repeat it again and again meaning somethign lyk: This is wat i live by, this is what is out there, this is my dream, my hope, my attempt, my worse nightmare....ect....etc (however u spell it lol)      Surrounded by A substance of Shadows     - Shadows are basically nothing. They are the result of light being blocked out. Basically, the imaginary light hides the real world from us. When it is blocked out, the result is a shadow - something dark and scary, that shows the "true world" dark and scary (as told in the poem). Also the "substance" part is that shadows are nothing, so they can't be made of someting...in this poem they   are   made of something...    Made of Something A nonentity A hidden identity Mistrust of thought Teasing And tricking    - ...In this poem, the shadows are made of secrets and lies and trickery, all that stuff that lead to major problems between friends, enemies, countries, familis....Its sad isn't it?     And mistaking Weak from Strong, This is my Song    - did you ever realize that bad peeps are always picking on those more helpless, less strong, and more innocent? Just wanted to point it out.      Forced to trust A wisdom’s enigma, Destiny’s drama, An hypocrite’s dogma, The delightfulness of trauma.    - The phrase "forced to trust..."- stuff that don't make since but nobody will speak up agaisnt. "Wisdom's enigma" - wisdom brings great suffering, along with great power, "ignorance is bliss", wat that line is saying is mainly, we strive for wisdom, but understanding in it's own is confusing. "Destiny's Drama" - Destiny ("detiny {Just picture me doing lil quotes with my fingers lol}) "controls" our future. Things are happy, sometimes so wonderful. But then things are sad, dramatic, sometimes really sad. "A hypocrite's dogma" - people go against their religion - so how devote are they? They say they believe something than go agaisnt it - which basically makes them either a liar or a hypocrite. "The delightfulness of trauma" - meaning something lyk "we force ourselves to see beyond the bad, which is a good thing - but ignoring it all together doesn't help it become any better.     A lie told and retold Till it was almost the truth,     - This relates the poem in the sence that people trust this "fake light" which brightens the truth into making the world seem better than this. The truth  lies  (that is basically the whole point of the poem). But this line also points out that is a lie spreads lyk "a burning tongue of hate(or flame)" it almost becomes the truth.     From Shadow’s Solidity Comes a world of fake Radiance,    -    This takes the phrases from above, and kind of changes it - (I am thinking about rewording this part) it means: Just lyk a shadow is solid, the "fake light" is real. (it means that it isn't, because shadows aren't solid so the world's "fake light" isn't true)...    Nothing is left Of Moral’s honorable fight   , Moral is loosing, people thinks it's cool to be bad and that it is wrong to be good. That is basically wat that line means lol.     Truth’s flawless face Is now a scarred blight, Worsened by resisting That Imaginary Light,      -     basically, truth is "deformed" - people tell lies and trick and cheat lyk wild fire. (Now back to the "fake light" topic) And if truth tries not to resist the "fake light" (because the fake light makes it look lyk that truth is sill intact), truth becomes more "deformed"...basically...     And all along From Right to Wrong This is my song     - Mainly - no matter wat the world thinks, "This is my song"        What has our world become? Love is weak Hate is strong Who can resist? Who can hold out for long? Is this a song?    - This is the one time in the poem where the character feels worried that she won't be able to keep to her song. SHe is afraid that she will not be able to keep her head screwed on straight.        And whether We will ever realize the truth Or live lies Or I will even belong    - I'm going to change this part a bit - but - for now here is what it means: The person is saying that no matter what the world says or thinks of her....       This is my song    -... she will stick to her song (i'm acually thinking of turning this into a song lol)      Hope this helped a lil!!!       -Sharpie

       Here is a peom i wrote - It is called awake - and it is relating the feeling of finally realising what was really happening and knowing you can make it better - to the moment where you open your eyes and they burn cause of how bright the light is.   -Sharpie    Awake    Looking into the light After hours of darkness A lifetime of darkness A lifetime to mourn A lifetime to yearn For something better My eyes burn    Sends a silent shiver up my spine In a quick burst of heat and flame And fluorescent frost I am finally awake From dreadful dreams That haunt That scare That blare emotions That rise too high To cope with, or To deal with    Salty tears From aching years Are all released I am finally awake I can finally escape From a daunting shape And a vivid shadow That looks upon me And sneers Despite my resisting and aching tears    Realizing the truth Reliving my life Reconstructing my fears Recalling my strife Is not a way to live Right after I awake And understand You have turned on the light    The light reaching into my soul Banishing the dark Igniting the coal Left by the evil that once dwelled there The banished evil The sightless bile The endless turmoil The depraved The fake It is finally all gone I am finally awake    copyright 2004 Stephanie ********

        Ok sheepz and peepz (inside joke - don't ask), if you haven't checked out this site you should! I was in a play called Banned Together and  urlLink  here   is it's website - or you could go straight to the Banned Together site  urlLink  here  . It was a super cool play!!! But I can't post the script because it belongs to 24 teens, not only me, and well, I don't think I really should, at least until it is completely copy-righted and everything, and well...you get my point. Also, if you look hard enough, you can find pics of me. I'm blonde and tall and wear white shoes with blue stripes on them. I'm on the front page. And I have a shot by myself, in a few pics I'm wearing a Snow Bunny shirt. Good Luck!!! If you ever hear about a musical called Banned Together - know where it came from - 24 teens who wrote it and performed it in 3 and 1/2 weeks!!!     -Sharpie

        This Story is called "The Mirror" and honestly - It's a little depressing. But it is a good story and I enjoyed writing it. It is a suspence though... and I got in trouble for turing it in for a school project...(don't ask)...but here it is for your reading pleasure. Also know, that I'm working on an alternate ending to this story - so keep checking back...     -Sharpie          The Mirror      Chapter 1 - Sefina Blood I awoke. Or at least I thought I did, I mean, I could still be asleep. I had this really funny feeling all through my body, and supposedly, you don’t feel anything while your sleeping, but, of course, I could be imagining that tingly sensation in my dream, or I could really be awake feeling that sensation. I already felt drowsy again. All this thinking is confusing me. Or maybe I was confused to begin with, just confusing myself more at the moment, confusing myself with all these different facts that I don’t even remember. Actually, I don’t even remember knowing anything, I don’t remember having any memories at all. Like I’m just making up all these facts and thoughts to fit my needs. But its almost as if I remember something though. It’s almost like trying to recall a dream, the dream, some awareness that it was, but not exactly knowing what was, if you know what I mean. I remember a numbness, and darkness, and a feeling told me it was horrible. Absolutely unimaginably terrible with a pinch of deceit and hate, or let me change that, and fist-full of deceit, and a heart full of hate, lots of hate. But I couldn’t quite place what it was. I couldn’t quite place anything; it was all dark and blurry, lots of shadows and vague images. Vague images I wasn’t sure I wanted to remember. I looked around; I just realized that I was still actually part of time, sitting on a bed, in a room that I couldn’t identify. A very plain room it was, with very little objects in it, but I did seem to be able to recall one word: Mirror. I was staring at a mirror, staring back at a face, which like that dream, seemed distant and full of indescribable feelings. Looking at that face, I saw hurt, fear, and doubtfulness, that face showed something it didn’t want to accept. That face was familiar to me in a way, as though I stared at it before, many, many times. And that’s when it hit me, that was my face, my hurt, torn, face full of fear and doubtfulness. But why could that be? I kept on looking at that mirror, unable to take my eyes off me. I concentrated very hard, searching through my soul for a reason, but I couldn’t find any, not any at all. This was very confusing, yet I couldn’t stop staring at myself. My expressionless mouth, my pale cheeks, my troubled eyes, a blue shade, and my hair. I thought really hard but no words would describe the matted hair flowing from my head. But then there were the rich red spots all over my face, pulled through my hair, rubbed onto my hands, the spots that looked as if they were once liquid but had dried up, but finally the word came, even though it had no meaning to me: blood. Blood. Blood. Blood. I though hard about that word, but I couldn’t think of a definition. It seemed to send an eerie tingle down my spine, but I couldn’t think of what the rich-red dried liquid on my face had to do with it. I wrapped my arms around my stomach in frustration and looked down, but realized that was a mistake. There was a lot of that “blood” soaking through my clothes that was still wet, still in liquid form. The thought of it made me feel something that was erringly familiar, from that “dream” which I wasn’t quite sure was a dream, and finally, a few words came. Sick. Scared. Stupid. Three words that began with a letter, um, “S”. S, S, S, that’s it! It also started my name: Sefina. My name is Sefina. But those three words: sick, scared, and stupid still had little meaning to me. Sick. Sick. What can it possibly mean? I looked around the room for any clues, hoping that the answer would just come to me. The room was bare, except for the bed I was sitting on, the mirror, and two types of utensils, laying on some kind of table. Sick. I still didn’t understand, but my mind seemed to be sidetracked easily, considering that I completely forgot about that word, Sick, and stared at the utensils. One was hand size, and looked as if a barrel and a long tunnel were attached to it. It let out a small stream of smoke from the tunnel. The other was sharp, and it looked new, as if someone had just obtained it from somewhere. It was made from the shiniest material I ever remember seeing, yet there was something dull about it, something so dull, it brought that word sick back to my mind. It was covered with that rich red liquid, which I classified as blood. The blood must be the sickening feeling I get. Sick. Sickening. That makes sense. Sick means that turning of the stomach when one looks at something unpleasant, like blood. Scared. This word is also unknown to me. It is definitely a feeling of some sort, one which I probably experienced, but don’t quite understand its definition. So I started thinking about all the feelings I have ever felt, or remember. I have felt an anger at myself not being able to recall the “dreams”, but that’s not scared. I have felt uneasiness at the blood, but I already identified that as sick. I have felt confused over all these memories I never seem to remember, but that is not scared. Scared must be that petrifying feeling I somehow recall from my “dream”, if I still have the right to classify my memories as that. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. This word came a lot easier to me than the others, considering I have already sorted my feelings out. Stupid is how the puzzling feelings I am having, but something else. There is something else that causes me to feel "stupid". But this Stupid is different. This stupid is something from that so-called dream, that so-called dream which causes me to feel all these different feelings all at once, overwhelming me, making me feel a weight tugging inside of my body, some type of pressure and misery. Stupid was the deceit I felt, not knowing I was being deceived till the blood poured out of my body. All of a sudden, I don't really believe I want to remember this dream. I stood up. It isn’t as easy as it sounds I tell you. I had to will my legs to move, my knees to bend, my body to work. I pushed with my hands against the hard, cold bed, straightened my stiff, tired knees, lifted my head and back, nice and straight. And I expected to feel something, but no feelings came. Except, what I was trying to feel wasn’t a feeling. I somehow knew that something was supposed to be happening that wasn’t happening. So then I started feeling scared again. Why wasn’t my body working? Why didn’t I feel this unknown “feeling”? Questions flooded to me just like the feelings flooded to me before. Questions that eventually started to scare me all the more. “What’s wrong with me?” I tried saying aloud, trying to use my throat, my vocal cords, my tongue. It felt weird and awkward, hearing these sounds erupt from my mouth. Hearing my thoughts come alive by the power of language. Except, it wasn’t as grand as all of that. The words came out like this: “Whas wong wihme?” But, nonetheless, I was speaking again, exercising my voice. My voice. My voice. It sounded somewhat lower than I intended it to. I was expecting something else, something sweeter than sugar, smoother than silk, and richer than gold. Something more graceful than graceful, more beautiful than beautiful, more musical than musical. It was disappointing to me, just like my looks were. But why does it matter, there’s no one here to listen to me. I’m alone…all by myself…no one…….or maybe… Other people actually exist. While I’m thinking all of this, I know I knew this except I didn’t actually know that I knew what I knew. Complicated? All these thoughts are coming to me easier, I don’t hesitate on words or phrases as much because I am becoming familiar with this central understanding. This central understanding that can only be further described with one word: the truth.   Chapter 2 - Cassy Darkness and Emptiness I ran. I don’t know why, but I did. I was completely tense, yes, but why was I running? It would just be bring more attention to myself at this late hour. I hid my hands in my pockets, hoping nobody would notice them, I don‘t need any more attention. “Nobody needs to know,” I kept whispering to myself, wind and bugs alike, zooming past my face, past my horrid face. People stared at me, but I didn’t care. They stared at my dark hair, flowing in the wind. They stared at my bright face, flushed from which I had just witnessed, or committed. They stared at my long legs, running so fast, so fast, they had to really pay attention to keep their eyes on me. But they can only see what they can see, and they couldn’t see what was inside of my soul, which was good, really good. I kind of went blank after awhile, I stopped my endless drone of “Nobody needs to know.” I was somewhat reassured at the moment. I kept one thought inside of me, the thought of running. The process of running. The actual state of running. The being of running. The ability of running. The nature of running. The sin of which I was running from. The guilt from which I was running from. The thoughts from which I was running from. Running. Running. Running. One leg placed a foot from the other, than repeated by the other foot at a rapid pace. So fast, so quick, like lightning. Like the wind, like a gun shot, fired, or a knife, lashed out into someone’s heart, someone’s heart, boom-BOOM…boom-boom…….boom…dwindling off into a nothingness, still as stone, never to move again, petrified. I ran out of breath. I didn’t realize how long I have been running. I needed rest, and I needed shelter. The icy rain and hail started beating on my back, hard as tiny stones, being thrown continuously. And just my luck, a cavern, off by a river, nobody lived there, so nobody would know. Nobody needs to know. The darkness didn’t scare me. It wasn’t as dark as my heart, my head, my soul. What scared me was the emptiness. Because unlike the dark, and it’s relation with my heart, my head, and my soul, emptiness had nothing to do with my heart, my head, and my soul. My heart was beating, unlike someone else’s at this very moment. Beating more quickly than a cheetah running, a tornado whirling, blood dripping. My head, full of thousands of thoughts I didn’t quite understand, or want to understand, full of questions that needed answering. My soul, full of evil things I didn’t recognize, even by the dim light that was once present in there. But nonetheless, the emptiness of the cave was shelter. I walked into it with my hands out, making sure I don’t run into anything more awful than myself, if there was a such thing, but I was more likely to run into the side of the cavern. I was surprised, so surprised, I was scared, when I stepped on something sharp. Something so sharp, that it went right through the sole of my shoe, and my inner soul, hopefully piercing some of the evil things in there. But to my dismay, it pierced the only goodness left in me. Because, there on the floor of the forsaken cavern, was a shattered mirror. A shattered mirror too sharp to put back together, the pieces too small to matter, but there, in its opposite universe, I saw a murderer.   Chapter 3 - Sefina Memories I sat back down, memories started coming piece by piece back to me. I remember my first day of school, how I became everyone’s friend so quickly and how I had so much fun. And I remember when I got my first kitten, how soft it’s fur was and how rough it’s tongue was. I remembered my braces, painful, yes, but resulting in beauty, a beautiful smile. I remember resting my feet in the Atlantic Ocean, and how warm the water was. I remember the beauty of my Nana’s roses, but how painful holding one can be. I remember the talent show, and how I took home 1st prize. I remember my parents arguing endless nights and their divorce. I remember how I felt about my mother remarrying. I remember my best friend, and how much we just loved to talk. I remember the computer room, and the Internet, and instant messaging. I remember how relieved I was to lay my head down at night. I remember all the movies I would watch over and over again. I remember all my books, fiction of course. I remember moving from our old house to our new one, and how I had to start all over, and succeeded. I remember the taste of chocolate, milky and rich. I remember how I found gold, only to find it’s glitter was for fool’s. I remember seeing snow for my first time, and loving how it would melt on my tongue. I remember the tornado, and how it sucked away all that was good. I remember my bedroom, and the wide window I couldn’t live without. I remember the way my crush would look at me. I remember the soft couch I would sit and read on all day long. I remember when a snake bit me, and terrified I would die, only to find out it wasn‘t poisonous. I remember when my kitten died, and how sad I felt. I remember when I played piano in my first recital, and how magical it was. I remember the scent of fresh bread, and how wonderful I would feel when I took a bite. I remember the TV, and how I would spend a few hours a day staring at it. I remember Walt Disney World, and riding Splash Mountain, terrifying, yet exciting. I remember rehearsing again and again for my main role in the school play, and I remember singing and singing, promising myself I would try out for American Idol, and I remember running the mile for the fitness tests, and I remember my pink dress, and I remember my favorite dark eyeliner, and I remember my own bedside lamp, and I remember my own murder.   Chapter 4 - Cassy A Co-de-sac I started sobbing. A murderer? I am a murderer? A filthy, murdering piece of dust, if I am worthy enough to call myself that. I feel worthless. I fell miserable. I feel terrified. I feel regret. I feel pain. I feel… I laid down and cried myself to sleep. Images started jumping at me. Hazy images, images of scary things, invisible at first, then all of a sudden, jumping out from a nothingness. Then the nothingness they came from surrounded me, and I was scared. I screamed to try and fill the silence, when I heard a girl laugh. I was confused. She had a beautiful laugh, her voice ringed bells. It was sweeter than sugar, smoother than silk, and richer than gold, fool’s gold. It was more graceful than graceful, more beautiful than beautiful, more musical than musical. I needed to find that voice, but I was lost. I looked around, but all I saw was empty space. And I sat down in frustration. But the beautiful voice came closer. “What bothers you so?” the beautiful voice asked. It was almost as if the voice was coming from an invisible being. And as if the voice knew I was categorizing it as that, it sat down beside me, and asked me again “What bothers you so?” I couldn’t answer. I could almost see her smile and she waited. She was very patient. And finally I could answer, when my sobbing subsided for a little. “I am a hypocrite. I am a fake person, a fake daughter, and a fake sister.” I could almost see the voice look into my eyes and say, “No you’re not.” “Yes I am,” I responded, starting to cry again. I bit my tongue, till it bled, and then faced where the invisible being would have been if she were alive, and said, “I murdered you.” I stood up, I knew I wasn’t dreaming any longer, I couldn’t live with this pain. I couldn’t live with anything, anyone, any thought, any punishment, there was nothing left for me. Death is a co-de-sac, and I was running around the circle, back where I came from. I sprinted out into the hail, out into the rain, out into the cold. I was blinded by the brightness of street lights, but I knew where I was going. I was numb from the hate I had, the love I had, and the pain I would’ve felt, if I wasn’t numb. Nothing is going to stop me. I ran into the room. And stopped. There lay the body of my dead sister. I was so angry, so mad, so confused, so terrified, almost petrified. “I HATE YOU!!!” I screamed into the stiff atmosphere of the room. I felt so relieved, then I felt regret. I was a little more hesitant about my feelings, but why shouldn’t I be experiencing them? She always pretended she was the best, the most wonderful, the smartest, the cleanest, the prettiest… “I’ll tell you what, Sefina.” I spat on her. “You’re so stuck up and goody-goody! You deserved to die!” And at that I ran over to the knife at the table. And struck it into my heart. . Chapter 5 - Sefina Understanding “Noooo!” I screamed. “What have you done, Cassy?” I was back in the room, and my sister was on the floor, dead. I could no longer see her body, but I could see her spirit, which at this moment, took the form of her body, like mine. I lifted Cassy up onto her feet and hugged her, tears starting to well up into my eyes. “What have you done, Cassy?” I asked again. She struggled in my arms and started screaming “LET-GO-OF-ME!!!” But I wouldn’t. I was sobbing by now. This was all my fault. “Cassie. Please, hold still.” She did, I could tell she did it reluctantly though. “Cassie,” I took a deep breath, I couldn’t talk, my throat was dry. “Why?” She started talking through gritted teeth. “It was never fair! When it was our first day of school, I sat in the corner, lonely, watching you become everyone’s friend so quickly. And when you got a kitten, I got a fish. Your braces made her beautiful, mine made me ugly. We both stuck our feet in the Atlantic Ocean, and you said the water was warm. I thought it was cold. We both wrapped our hands around Nana’s roses. You got pricked, but I was pricked worse. We both tried out for the talent show. I didn’t make it pass auditions. Our parents argued endless nights, and they only stayed together so long because they loved you, not me. I was always so upset to lay my head down at night, knowing I would have to spend another day with you. When we moved to a new house, I failed in starting over, and had to watch you succeed. You always ate all the chocolate before I got one piece. I found real gold, but threw it out because you said mine was fake. A week before we saw snow, you were sick with a cold, and you passed the cold to me. You were all better during our vacation, but I wasn’t allowed outside. In our bedroom, your bed was right by the large window, not mine. Our parents loved how you enjoyed reading, they were always disappointed with me. I was the one who told you you would die when you were bitten by the snake; it was April Fool’s Day. I wasn’t sad when your cat died because you weren’t sad when my fish died. I played nicely at our first recital, but nobody cared. I was the only one who knew how to make bread from scratch, and I never so much as hear a “thank-you” from you. I rode Splash Mountain with you because no one else would, and I puked all the way down. I was a stage hand in the school play, and my voice was never as sweet as yours, and I failed the fitness tests, and I owned an ugly dress, and I had to borrow your makeup, and I didn’t cherish my bedside lamp like you did, and I murdered you, and I don‘t regret it, and…….” She was crying. I was crying, and I knew she wasn’t serious about the last part, not any more. “Cassy, please sit down I want to tell you a story.” I was calm, a little calmer than I should’ve been, but she listened.    Chapter 6 The Mirror “Once upon a time, there were two beautiful girls, who easily misunderstood each other. They both envied each other and were always happy for the other, but they were both too selfish and full of pride to realize it.” Sefina held her hand out to touch her sister’s cheek, and smiled. Cassy smiled back, but her smile was bitter. Cassy soon realized that the touch was sharing Sefina’s feelings and experiences with her. Cassy was still, almost like she was watching a movie, a movie showing all the events of their lives through Sefina’s eyes. She saw that Sefina cared so much about her and Cassy realized Sefina never hated her. Her heart almost started to rejoice, but then it felt raw, and bitter again. Finally, the story reached it’s ending scene. Sefina narrated it. “Sefina was alone one day, in their old house, in a bare room, the one that Cassy told her to meet her in. Sefina admired her sister so and didn’t understand when the knife was pushed into her stomach. Sefina felt no physical pain, but the emotional pain was what caused her to die. Sefina did not feel the gunshot that should’ve ended her misery, for she had already left the world that you and I used to know. She blanked out what happened, and forgot everything. Even her own name. All she remembered was something wasn’t right. Her dream was the past, and she soon realized she was dead for she was missing a feeling, a feeling that wasn’t a feeling, and that was pain. She knew she should have felt something, some sort of pain, but she didn’t. And Cassy, you need to finish the story.” So Cassy held out her hand, and touched Sefina’s cheek softly, and smiled a humble smile, and continued, narrating the story that appeared before Sefina’s eyes. “Cassy knew she shouldn’t have done what she had done, and deeply regretted it, but wouldn’t let herself know that. She ran away from the truth, and, Sefina, you set her in the right direction, with your musical voice, but Cassy couldn’t redeem herself.” Cassy started crying silently. “There were only two doors left, and Cassy chose the easy one, the wrong one: death. That rode was a co-de-sac” The two sisters embraced and smiled. They were both sobbing. Both of their hearts was broken, physically and emotionally. But the were dead, and nothing could change that. “Sefina,” Cassy managed to say, “I am so sorry.” Cassy couldn’t look at her sister. She didn’t expect forgiveness. Sefina lifted a mirror, the mirror, so that she and Cassy could both see into it. The next phrase that left Sefina’s lips would cause Cassy’s destruction or lead to her redemption. Sefina nodded and whispered, “I love you.”

         "My Song" is about today's world mainly - how it is  "good"  to be " bad"  in a way. There is so much pressure put on us by our peers and " friends " that it is sometimes too hard to say  no . This poem is kinda questioning what is going on in the world and the person talking in the poem hopes that she will be able to keep her head on her shoulders. Here is a quote I like, but I'm not sure who said it:  "If God wanted me to get high, he would've given me wings."  Also I think Carol Weston said this one:  "I don't drink because I want to know when I'm having a good time."        -Sharpie

        This is the first poem of mine I will be posting. This is it's new and improved version - so if you've already heard this poem, i suggest you read it again because I changed it.      -Sharpie         My Song          Blinded by Imaginary Light, Forged from A child’s laughter And a burning tongue of Hate, Who is to blame For this misinterpretation Of right And wrong? This is my song  Surrounded by A substance of Shadows, Made of Something A nonentity A hidden identity Mistrust of thought Teasing And tricking And mistaking Weak from Strong, This is my Song  Forced to trust A wisdom’s enigma, Destiny’s drama, An hypocrite’s dogma, The delightfulness of trauma. A lie told and retold Till it was almost the truth, From Shadow’s Solidity Comes a world of fake Radiance, Nothing is left Of Moral’s honorable fight, Truth’s flawless face Is now a scarred blight, Worsened by resisting That Imaginary Light, And all along From Right to Wrong This is my song  What has our world become? Love is weak Hate is strong Who can resist? Who can hold out for long? Is this a song?  And whether I will ever realize the truth Or live lies Or even belong This is my song    Copyright in 2004 by Stephanie *********
