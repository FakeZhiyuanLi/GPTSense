      Whether you have come here intentionally (which would be quite surprising), or completely by mistake and have decided to read on, I have to warn you that once in a while, my cheerful amigo there mich, will produce an unlimited amount of uncomprehensible psychobabble which sounds something like this::                                  "The `vacuum` command (or the vacuumdb shell script) will garbage collect your db.                  If you run it together with the analyzer option, it will calculate statistics for use by the                  optimizer... As an example, I just gained a factor 30 of increased query speed on a table                  in one of my databases"   This is due to a condition which has surfaced in the last couple of years, closely associated with Turret's syndrome and manic depressive confinement. It is not dangerous at first, but is utterly USELESS to most people who have enough neurons to make that whole 'hand-eye coordination' thing work.  I suggest that when you see this gagababble, simply run to the next paragraph, basically, to what I have to say. (unless of course mich has a moment of lucidity and writes anything about jugs, sex, beer, dumps, blogs, ghettos and hoes.  You've been warned  Tada

      If you are a postgresql user/admin and you've never used `vacuum analyze` - then you are in for a treat. The `vacuum` command (or the vacuumdb shell script) will garbage collect your db. If you run it together with the analyzer option, it will calculate statistics for use by the optimizer...  As an example, I just gained a factor 30 of increased query speed on a table in one of my databases...   All hail postgres..

      Yo, speaking of the music industry.. they are having some trouble.. EMI France just laid off a couple singers - Ophelie Winter, etc. I say this is doing the music industry some good! at least we don't have to listen to shit like Ophelie anymore.. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST! Deal with it you BASTARDS! But seriously, do they think they're going to convince us to give them any MORE money? I mean why pay for the music that is already free.. hmmm.. I don't get that logic at all.   For once we're showing those greedy bastards at the top that they, too, can experience the well known sensation of SHIT HITTING THE FAN, which all of us normal earthlings deal with daily. I say "long live the internet" .. and beer

I love food.. mmm fooood.   I think i'm going home, I'm sick of work for today.. that's it, I've had enough.

      Oh.. increasing the price for online music - that's going to help the improve sales..  According to  urlLink Macworld  five of the top labels are pushing for the increase - and a song from iTunes could increase from 99 cents to a whopping $2.49 - making it (alot) more expensive to download the songs, than to purchase the album.

      The blog is online and ready for abuse.. so here goes..  Well, today was another one of those days, where I wished I could stay home and sleep.. They seem to follow each other closer and closer every day.  Convinced 'da boss' that we need to do major upgrades in our test lab.. The home-built table on which we test fairly expensive network equipment, needs to be changed - one of those roller-tables is what we need.. Also need a couple of TFT monitors, so we can move the monitors around without breaking our backs !!

      Exactemundo ! That's right ! We are almost homefree, just another couple of hours to go. This time the weekend brings us another small surprise: Monday is a bank holiday ! Yes, sir-eee-bob! A cool three days of not going to work. So, what are my plans for these work-free days ? Nothing much ! I think I'll try and cook some traditional Danish food, as it has been a long time since I got some of that - and our kitchen closets could need some cleaning up as well.. Exciting, isn't it ? Furthermore, I'm on the lookout for a wet-stone for sharpening my global knives, anyone know where I can get those around Paris ?  That's it for me, have a good one.

      So, Portugal won over Monaco in some lame soccer match last night - big fucking deal ! People go on the street and yell of joy, they disturb a normal peaceful neighborhood with their noise and spectacle. Police, apparently, let them be - because, you know, their team won a stupid match. They get to drive their cars up and down Champs-Elysees hanging out the window, while honking their horns.. on any other day, you would get a ticket for that - but again the cops let it slide...  So here's my question..  Next time Tiger Woods bring home the PGA trophy, would it be acceptable for me to drive down Champs-Elysees, while honking my horn and screaming like a madman out of the window ? Can I walk around small streets in normally quiet neighborhoods yelling and screaming ? Can I light up flares in the middle of street, and sing songs about Tiger ?  I hate soccer, it's a lame-ass sport - and big part of the audience are a bunch of uneducated morons ! Let's ban this sports once and for all, along with religion and tofu-food !

      Good  urlLink news  ! Apparently  urlLink Microsoft  has decided to integrate the MS 'Called ID' system, into the efforts of the  urlLink SPF project  (Sender Policy Framework). This a major win for the project, that has already been recognized by big players like Google, AOL and Earthlink. Perhaps we can finally start to fight the ever increasing spam problem..

      Recently (well actually something like 3 weeks ago) I decided to purchase a Secure Digital 512MB expansion kit for my iPaq. So I browsed around on the net, to figure out where I could get a good deal.  urlLink FNAC  and  urlLink DARTY  were both well over 200 EUR for the card, and being a cheapo as I am - I found that a bit steep. I found sweet offer through  urlLink Kelkoo  with  urlLink Nomatica ; basically I could get it for something like 160 EUR. Well.. wonderful, good, great, etc etc... Though, I've been waiting 3 weeks for those fuckwits to ship it to me !! I've sent a couple of emails, querying them - only one of them got a reply, and it was useless..  I called them a couple of times, each time they promise me that it is being shipped pronto.. Damn it! It's not rocket-science do put an item in a box, and ship it - I mean, am I being too demanding ?  I'll give them until Monday, if not the card is on my table by then - I'll start a holy war with them..   ps. Yes! I did choose the more expensive shipping facility, not " urlLink El Poste " where only 40% of your packages are being delivered.

      Here's what you need:  2 Tablespoons of olive oil 4 Chicken filets 3 Thinly sliced, skinned, seeded tomatoes 2 cloves of crushed garlic 1 Tablespoon on of Balsamic vinegar oil 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar Half an onion (Thinly sliced) A couple of fresh shredded basil leaves  Heat the oil in a large frying pan, and cook the filets until cooked through, and browned on the sides. Place the filets on some absorbent paper, and cover. On the same pan, add the garlic and cook until soft; then add the sliced tomatoes, onion, vinegar and brown sugar. Cook, while stirring until the sugar has completely melted. Then, leave simmering for about 5 minutes or until the tomato-sauce thickens. Serve the chicken with the sauce on top, spread a bit of basil over the sauce.  Can be served with rice, pasta or potatoes. Bon appetit !

      One sunny day in 2005 an old man approached the White House from across Pennsylvania Avenue, where he'd been sitting on a park bench. He spoke to the U. S. Marine standing guard and said, "I would like to go in and meet with President Bush."  The Marine looked at the man and said, "Sir, Mr. Bush is no longer president and no longer resides here."  The old man said, "Okay" and walked away.  The following day, the same man approached the White House and said to the same Marine, "I would like to go in and meet with President Bush." The Marine again told the man, "Sir, as I said yesterday, Mr. Bush is no longer president and no longer resides here." The man thanked him and, again, just walked away.  The third day, the same man approached the White House and spoke to the very same U. S. Marine, saying "I would like to go in and meet with  President Bush."  The Marine, understandably agitated at this point, looked at the man and said, "Sir, this is the third day in a row you have been here asking to speak to Mr. Bush. I've told you already that Mr. Bush is no longer the president and no longer resides here. Don't you understand?"  The old man looked at the Marine and said, "Oh, I understand. I just love hearing it."  The Marine snapped to attention, saluted, and said, "See you tomorrow."

      After a nice (short) vacation, and a shitload of cold brewskies - I'm back at the what-have-ya, work.. As Dim clearly states, why the hell do time pass by soooooo fast when you are not at work ?   So I'm sitting here typing like a jackass on my keyboard, waiting for Friday to emerge.. Physically I know it's only Tuesday, but mentally I'm way off into the weekend - needless to say the weather is awesome, which makes it so much harder to sit at a desk - obviously it'll change for monsoon or snow-storm by the time we hit Friday afternoon.. Crap..   Oh, by the way, I signed up for my one-month free trial period with  urlLink DVDchezvous,  so it'll be interesting to see how it works out - I'll keep you updated..

      Got this from a buddy, and it shows you the hell IT can be..  **** Costello Wants to buy a Computer from Abbott  ****   ABBOTT: Super Duper computer store. Can I help you?   COSTELLO: Thanks. I'm setting up an office in my den, and I'm thinking about buying a computer.   ABBOTT: Mac?   COSTELLO: No, the name's Lou.   ABBOTT: Your computer?   COSTELLO: I don't own a computer. I want to buy one.   ABBOTT: Mac?   COSTELLO: I told you, my name's Lou.   ABBOTT: What about Windows?   COSTELLO: Why? Will it get stuffy in here?   ABBOTT: Do you want a computer with Windows?   COSTELLO: I don't know. What will I see when I look in the windows?   ABBOTT: Wallpaper.   COSTELLO: Never mind the windows. I need a computer and software.   ABBOTT: Software for Windows?   COSTELLO: No. On the computer! I need something I can use to write proposals, track expenses and run my business. What have you got?   ABBOTT: Office.   COSTELLO: Yeah, for my office. Can you recommend anything?   ABBOTT: I just did.   COSTELLO: You just did what?   ABBOTT: Recommend something.   COSTELLO: You recommended something?   ABBOTT: Yes.   COSTELLO: For my office?   ABBOTT: Yes.   COSTELLO: OK, what did you recommend for my office?   ABBOTT: Office.   COSTELLO: Yes, for my office!   ABBOTT: I recommend Office with Windows.   COSTELLO: I already have an office and it has windows! OK, lets just say, I'm sitting at my computer and I want to type a proposal. What do I need?   ABBOTT: Word.   COSTELLO: What word?   ABBOTT: Word in Office.   COSTELLO: The only word in office is office.   ABBOTT: The Word in Office for Windows.   COSTELLO: Which word in office for windows?   ABBOTT: The Word you get when you click the blue "W."   COSTELLO: I'm going to click you're blue "W" if you don't start with some straight answers. OK, forget that. Can I watch movies on the Internet?   ABBOTT: Yes, you want Real One.   COSTELLO: Maybe a real one, maybe a cartoon. What I watch is none of your business. Just tell me what I need!   ABBOTT: Real One.   COSTELLO: If its a long movie I also want to see reel 2,3 & 4. Can I watch them?   ABBOTT: Of course.   COSTELLO: Great, with what?   ABBOTT: Real One.   COSTELLO; OK, I'm at my computer and I want to watch a movie. What do I do?   ABBOTT: You click the blue "1."   COSTELLO: I click the blue one what?   ABBOTT: The blue "1."   COSTELLO: Is that different from the blue "W"?   ABBOTT: The blue "1" is Real One and the blue "W" is Word.   COSTELLO: What word?   ABBOTT: The Word in Office for Windows.   COSTELLO: But there's three words in "office for windows"!   ABBOTT: No, just one. but it's the most popular Word in the world.   COSTELLO: It is?   ABBOTT: Yes, but to be fair, there aren't many other Words left. It pretty much wiped out all the other Words out there.   COSTELLO: And that word is real one?   ABBOTT: Real One has nothing to do with Word. Real One isn't even part of Office.   COSTELLO: Stop! Don't start that again. What about financial bookkeeping, you have anything I can track my money with?   ABBOTT: Money.   COSTELLO: That's right. What do you have?   ABBOTT: Money.   COSTELLO: I need money to track my money?   ABBOTT: It comes bundled with your computer.   COSTELLO: What's bundled to my computer?   ABBOTT: Money.   COSTELLO: Money comes with my computer?   ABBOTT: Yes. No extra charge.   COSTELLO: I get a bundle of money with my computer? How much?   ABBOTT: One copy.   COSTELLO: Isn't it illegal to copy money?   ABBOTT: Microsoft gave us a license to copy Money.   COSTELLO: They can give you a license to copy money?   ABBOTT: Why not? THEY OWN IT!   COSTELLO: How do I turn my computer off??   ABBOTT: Click on "START"..

      As per Camel's request, here is the way I make a Flaming Dr. Pepper. This is another one of those fun little drinking that tend to hurt quite a bit the morning after...  Now there are quite a few ways to make this, and I've added a recipe for a similar drink at the end of the blog as well.  For this conconction, you will need: Amaretto White or Dark Rum (I prefer dark) Beer.  There is a couple steps in this, so be attentive.. - Fill a pint glass just over half way with some cheap-ass lager (aka beer, normal beer). Leave aside - Fill half a shot glass with Ameretto, and float the rum to fill the glass. (to float an alcohol, use the back of a spool or anything that will slow the speed of the alcohol pour, hence making it easier for it to float on a heavier alcohol)  - With a lighter, take your time and light the rum in the shot glass by holding the flame to the side of the shot glass, and turning it slowly, therefore heating the top layer or alcohol. After around 20 seconds, the rum should light. - Once the rum is lit, tell the dude getting canned to hold the half full pint glass, and drop the flaming shot into it. He has to shoot both the beer and the shot glass in the pint glass. Voila! Flaming Dr.Pepper!   Another drink, same principle, less burning. It's called an Irish Car Bomb.  instead of beer, use guinness instead of amaretto, use baileys and irish whisky (like Jameson's) You don't have to light it, just drop the shot in the guinness and chug.  voila! Cheers!  "The hard part about being a bartender is figuring out who is drunk and who is just stupid." - Richard Braunstein

      Ah well here we are again, it's that wonderful day, Friday, the day when almost anything can go wrong, and I wouldn't give a crap, simply because I know, I KNOW, that in a handful of hours, I'll be homefree. The only real problem with today is that I also know, yes I KNOW, that the weekend will go by way to fucking quickly (as usual), and it'll be Monday before I know it. Damn!  Why is that? Why is it that work days usually take ages, and the fun times like the weekend go by way to damn quickly? I mean what was that supreme being thinking when he put that algorithm in our stupid human heads: 'Hey I know, lets make these beings' brains function so that when everything is ok, it doesn't last long, but when things are fucking SHIT, we'll double the amount of time they percieve!' Way to go on that one G, yippee! But I'm still pretty content it's Friday, I mean it's not like it's been a hell of a week (we lazy French people had Thursday off, something to do with Jesus flying in the sky), and this last week has been the first time the weather was decent enough, so I can't complain. Plus, I haven't had to deal with mich's constant complaining, bitching, whining, so it's been pretty quiet. But as I said, it went by fast, and GUESS WHAT! Mich is back on Monday, so we're in for a hell of a next week, I'm telling ya.  Yesterday was good, was invited to a nice little BBQ in Paris, yes, Intra muros.. Some say it's not too legal, but we did it anyways- damn good merguez too - compliments to the Embassador, Roger Hobby. after a couple pint glasses of Pastis (heavily dosed), and listening to Ryan bitching about me not being sexual enough for him lately, we went home, and chilled. Overall a very good little afternoon. Well that's all I have to say for now, have a good Friday and weekend, and goddamnit ENJOY IT, cuz you know it'll be monday soon... DAMN!

      Ahhh, the summer has finally decided to be present in France this year - I was starting to worry we'd be wearing heavy leather jackets all of 2004, damn it. The summer is good, it's the time when you can enjoy the sun, the heat, and show off the fat you accumulated when you were stuffing yourself this past winter - yay! I'll see YOU by the pool- walking aruond in your Hawaiian swimwear, looking like a toasted aspirin, with your 30 pound beer gut hangin' out - ROCK ON! But no matter what, it's the summer, fuck it, let's have a drink and chill.  What better beverage (apart from Jack of course) to accompany this festive heat wave but a cold Mojito, made the RIGHT way.   Before you start, here are the magical ingredients..  - White Rum (get some Bacardi white rum, or Havana Club should do the trick) - fresh mint leaves (not mint syrup or anything but real chlorophyll-filled leaves) - some nice little limes (not lime juice, or sour mix- real LIMES, thank you.) - granulated brown suger (sugar cane sugar is the best way to go, although it works with normal sugar, although it's not as good) - if you really want to make it properly, have some angostura handy.. - some ice, yeah, frozen water works.  OK  In a NICE glass, preferably something with a large base (whiskey glass, lowball, etc) put about 2 teaspoons of brown sugar. Next squeeze in 2-3 wedges of lime, and add about 6 nice mint leaves. Mash the three ingredients using something like a pestle (What is a pestle? go to www.dictionary.com, and search for pestle) Once all of this has become a gooey pulp, you're ready for the next step - adding the crushed ice. - here's a method for crushing ice which work and isn't too much of a hassle. Take a couple ice cubes, place them in one of your cupped hands, and swing the pestle at them. This should give you some uneven crushed ice, which is perfect for the mojito. I don't like real crushed ice, because as i've said before it tends to melt too quickly.  Fill the glass up to the top with crushed ice. Add a couple drops of Angostura. Pour the white rum over the crushed ice up to the top of the glass.  Before serving, make sure the person mixes the beverage up, otherwise all the good stuff stays at the bottom, and the person gets a hard kick of really cold RUM (which is ok too)  Serve with a little straw, and you're golden! Go sit by the pool, chill in the sun, and sip away!  BTW, there are quite a few other drinks you can make with the ingredients i gave ya, including a ti punch, caipirinha. They are all based on the same principle: sugar and limes. For the Ti punch, don't add any mint, and for the caipirinha, you have to have some Cachaca handy... More drinks to come. CHEERS!

      Yes, Mich, myself, and our two lady friends had a wonderful fondue session last night, although as always, we had a hard time doing things in a civilized way.  Everything started out much like any adult thing, a little aperitif with olives and saucisson, nice little semi-educated chitchat, etc etc. We had a couple civilized drinks, and everything was fine and dandy - Until the Jack started hitting the few tired neurons we have left.   The Fondue was a big success - it was the first time we tried making one at home, and the result was very very nice.. I think the Jack, plus the 3/4 of a bottle of white wine and the Kirsch in the Fondue.   We played some Taboo in Frenglish (props to us though, the chicks were constantly cheating, and plus they're sour losers) and the next thing we knew, it was 3am and we were all starting to feel very very very "Tired", so mich and Karima got a cab home.  Drinks consumed: 2 bottles of Jack Daniels Old No.7 (That's a bottle each for me and mich) Half a bottle of Zubrovska vodka (The chicks) 1 bottle of white wine.  Mich, you have to come over soon, we've got to nail that Kahlua in some nice White Russians dude.

      Ok, so the future King of Denmark is getting married today.. Big deal. Denmark and Copenhagen especially has turned in to a huge media frenzy, and everyone thinks it is soooo great ! I wonder if all the Danish tax payers would be as happy about the whole shebang if they saw the total cost of the wedding - let alone the cost of the monarchy all together.. Sure, they do some PR for the nation, but is it really worth it ?   Anywho, I'll be "celebrating" the wedding with some nice Jack D. and fondue at my buddy Dim's palace, and let's see for how long the Danish royal family will be on our minds as soon as the Jack starts to flow..   Thank god it's Friday, and GUD BEVARE DANMARK - and God save the queen etc etc etc...

Well, I, for one, welcome our new superior saucer flying overlords ! Stop in, have a taco..

      Here's a shot that usually put people on the floor or facing a bucket pretty fast. Most of the people I've served this to have been either stupid teenagers that thought they could drink, or full out boozers such as mich. If you really want to put someone over the top, try this shot... Here goes.  The Ingredients:  Tequila. Triple Sec or Cointreau. Kahlua.  In a coffee mug (or something that resembles it, like a teacup, or one of those gay little tea or milk pots) pour 1.5 centiliters of each ingredient. Place the mug in  a microwave oven for about 15 seconds (just so the liquid is hot- not boiling, unless you hate the fucker your serving). Once out of the microwave, pour the nectar into a shot glass. Now since a normal shot glass is around 3.8 centiliters (although bars say it's 4 centiliter shots, they're actually cheating you out of .2cl of booze- an outright scandal), you'll have about half a shot too much left in the mug once you've filled the shot glass. Pour the rest of the liquid around the shot, or make a small line with it on the bar leading up to the glass. Give the sorry bastard a straw, and light the bit you poured on the bar around the shotglass. This shit will ignite like Napalm, so be careful. The bit on the bar should lead up the shot glass and light that as well. Once lit, tell the bastard to shoot it through the straw. Tada! you have a Cucaracha.  Note: if the poor individual drinking has had a few before the cucaracha, have a bucket handy.. trust me.   Cheers!!

      Alright, you guessed another one of my passions is good food. I like preparing food, unfortunately I don't get around doing it as much as I'd like to - probably because I'm a lazy bastard.. Oh well..  Anyways, my wife recently purchased a nice little book with a few simply dishes in, that I will try and experiment with.. I'll post the recipes and conclusions on this blog.  Pork Chops Valenciana: A couple of not too thick pork chops 175g Orange marmalade 2 Tablespoons chili sauce 1 Tablespoon cider vinegar 1 Teaspoon fresh grated ginger 1 Teaspoon ground cumin 2 Green Onions  Heat some oil on large pan, and fry the pork chops until brown on each side and well cooked inside. Meanwhile, add orange marmalade, chili sauce, vinegar, ginger and cumin into a sauce pan/pot and cook while stirring until the sauce thickens a little bit. Add the thinly sliced green onions to the sauce, and serve the pork chops covered with the sauce.  Can be served with any boiled/steamed vegetable, fx. Potatoes or asparagus.  The whole thing shouldn't take more than 20 minutes.  I prepared the dish last night, and the sweet'n'sour sauce really went very well with the pork chops - it is definitely not the last time I make this.. ;)

      So yesterday I received a new offer from my  urlLink bank  - through the Premier service I can sign up for  urlLink DVDchezvous  service for &euro; 28 / month. It works pretty much like the  urlLink NetFlix  service in the US. It's a great concept, but I still think that the price is a bit steep. Here's how it works: 1. You go and choose a film from their website, or place a call to their call center. 2. They send the movie(s) to an address of your choice. (Meaning you can still get your movie(s) while being on vacation) 3. After watching the movie(s) you put them in the envelope (pre-stamped) and post it.  You can keep the movie(s) for as long as you desire, but you can only "rent" two movies at a time.  The Premier service offers me a 1-month trial period, so I might try it out.. With a bit of luck the price will go down in the near future.

      How come whenever you are in a shop/service-center (or something like it) and you are standing in line or getting served - and if the telephone will ring they will ALWAYS answer it and make you stand and wait like a jackass. How come clients sitting on their fat behinds making a telephone call, will be priorities over the clients that have actually gone through the trouble to show up ? I don't think it makes any sense, and I believe that whenever you (the consumer) will experience this, it should NOT be frowned upon when you smack the idiot up over it..   Just my 2 cents..

      I recieved this email from my friend Paul R. I find it so true and so in synch with what i feel that I have left it untouched - so here you go.  PS: Lewis, don't think I'm plagiarizing, this is for the good of everyone.  Hello, my name is Lewis and I suffer from the guilt of not forwarding 50 billion fucking chain letters sent to me by people who actually believe that if you send them on, a poor 6-year-old girl in Arkansas with a breast on her forehead will be able to raise enough money to have it removed before her redneck parents sell her to a traveling freak show.  Do you honestly believe that Bill Gates is going to give you, and everyone to whom you send "his" email, $1000?  How stupid are we?  "Ooooh, looky here! If I scroll down this page and make a wish, I'll get laid by a model I just happen to run into the next day!"  What a bunch of bullshit.  Maybe the evil chain letter leprechauns will come into my house and sodomize me in my sleep for not continuing a chain letter that was started by Peter in 5 AD and brought to this country by midget pilgrims on the Mayflower.  Fuck 'em.  If you're going to forward something, at least send me something mildly amusing. I've seen all the "send this to 10 of your closest friends,and this poor, wretched excuse for a human being will  somehow receive a nickel from some omniscient being" letters about 90 times.  I don't fucking care.  Show a little intelligence and think about what you're actually contributing to by sending out these forwards. Chances are, it's our own unpopularity.  The point being? If you get some chain letter that's threatening to leave you shagless or luckless for the rest of your life, delete it. If it's funny, send it on.  Don't piss people off by making them feel guilty about a leper in Botswana with no teeth who has been tied to the ass of a dead elephant for 27 years and whose only salvation is the 5 cents per letter he'll receive if you forward this email.  Now forward this to everyone you know.  Otherwise, tomorrow morning your underwear will turn carnivorous and will  consume your genitals  Have a nice day.  P.S. Send me a 100 bucks ASAP.  Lewis

      I really get pissed off when i go into a bar and see the bartender making a White Russian - 95 percent of the time, the bastard behind the bar does not know what the hell he's doing, and being a former bartender, that just makes me want to jump over the bar and beat the shit out of him/her with a cocktail shaker. So I've decided to post a series of blogs concerning this issue, entitled "How I make a..." I figure you should trust me, if not in anything relatively important in life, at least in my ability to make/drink a beverage. So here goes.  A White Russian has three ingredients (well, 4 if you include the ice)  Vodka.  Kahlua.  Milk/ Cream.   Contrary to what the bastard bartender (mentioned above) believes, a white russian is a built drink, not a shaken one. DO NOT SHAKE a White Russian damn it! It's fucking blasphemy. Thank you.  This is how i do it.   Take a lowball glass - this is what you would refer to as a whisky glass i believe - a short fat glass. Add a couple of nice big ice cubes in there - not crushed ice.. crushed ice melts too quickly and renatured the taste of the ingredients. Over the ice, pour about 3 to 4 centiliters of white, unflavored vodka (like absolut or smirnoff - not something like absolut curant or zubrovska). Over the vodka, pour about the same quantity of Kahlua. You still with me?  OK   Now float the milk/cream over the now mixed vodka and kahlua. You should get a layer of brown (kahlua/vodka) and a layer of white (da milk/cream). Throw a couple coffee seeds on top of the milk/cream, and Voila! there's your White Russian.   Now I tend to like my drinks steep - I just think they taste better that way (and they do). But if you're a sissy, a loser, you can lower the amount of booze per drink.  Also do me a favor, the next time you go to a bar, ask for a white russian. If the bastard doesn't know how to make it, wack him across the head, and show him how to do it.. Cheers!!

      So I finally did it ! I purchased a GPS navigation system for my car. I had been on the look-out for a quite a while now - but I always thought that it was a bit pricy.. (It still is, but less.. ) Since we are going on a little vacation next week, I figured that I might as well get it now.. It also didn't help that Henrik has just been visiting me, and he works for Pioneer and loves to tease me with all the cool features of a navigation system. So saturday morning (or noon) when I woke up, I went to  urlLink Darty  in Ternes to purchase my  urlLink TomTom  Wireless GPS system. Unfortunantly they were sold out! But that didn't stop me, I drove out to Darty in Montparnasse where they had 4 left! The pack contains: 1 HP IPaq PocketPC, 1 GPS receiver (Bluetooth) and 1 car installation kit. We took it out for a test drive sunday afternoon, and it worked perfectly ! Now I just need to get someone to intall all the cables nicely in the car, or else it'll end up looking like my office with cables everywhere - so I am going up to Peugeot in La Defense where I bought my car tomorrow !

Comments are now also part of the Blogger features, so I have removed the old comments - and added the comment functionality. This, however, means that the old comments are gone.. Yeah, that's right - deal with it !

      Once again, the whole polemic over downloading music, and the music industry trying to brainwash us into thinking it's not morally right... What i don't find morally right is that when i buy a CD, such an infinitely small amount of my hard earned cash is actually going to the artist. The rest of my dosh is going to some bastard sitting in an office bigger than my apartment at EMI or Universal. Well I say it was about time something rocked the boat. This is putting the majors at risk (-20% sales in france since January), and it's created a time when the whole chabang has to be rethought.. They are trying to tell us it is wrong to download, yet they haven't yet figured out that as a whole, p2p users (in the millions) are a lot stronger then them, and that users will always find an alternate source to download from, which has happened in the past (napster - gnutella - kazaa - kazaa lite - edonkey - emule, etc, etc).   This is good for everyone, the internet is causing a revolution in this industry that was much needed. Wouldn't it be good to be able to download directly from the artist, and either donate/buy their tracks? Wouldn't the artists also prefer not being tied down by the majors? And what about all those artists that don't have a contract with EMI, Universal, etc? Won't they now, thanks to the internet, be able to have their music played out there?  Let's wait and see, shit has already hit the fan, and they can't arrest every mp3 downloader. They've got to learn to live with it one way or the other, so things are going to change.

         A nice response to the  urlLink SNEP  anti p2p campaign. Perhaps if the artists were actually making good music, and not just cover tracks of cover tracks, and "best of.." releases - then consumers would probably buy more albums !

      I took the  urlLink Cisco  ICND course a couple of years ago (I also attended the CIT course) - but it is just recently I thought it could be "fun" to actually take the certifications - first the  urlLink CCNA , and in time the  urlLink CCNP . I have contacted a few Cisco learning partners here in France, to find out whether or not I can take the exam in English (it is hard enough without me worrying about the language barrier) - while I'm waiting feedback, I have begun preparing for the test, and I found an online service that can give me a CCNA test ( urlLink find it here ) for free. The test is harder than I thought, and I'll probably have to read up on a lot of stuff -and it is not helping that the margin for error is very thin - you need 9 correct answers out of 10 !! Wish me luck..

      Ah, I couldn't resist the need to make an Ode to my good old friend the Serbian Ice Tea and his creator the one and only Marko Jovanovic. If you haven't had the chance to try this baby out, print out the following cocktail recipe, and stumble on over to your local bar (which i'm assuming is decent enough to have the ingredients needed) ASAP, because this is a legend.  The Details: - concocted for the first time sometime in mid to end 1997 at the Chesterfield Café (now The House of Live) by Doktor Marko - As I remember it was a Friday or Saturday night, or maybe a Wednesday... or, well.. - I got to knowing the recipe well because i later worked with Marko in 1999 at The Long Hop.  Here it is:  In a Pint Glass filled with ice:  1centiliter (cl.) : Malibu 1cl. : Southern Comfort 1cl. : Peach schnapps 1cl. : Kahlua 1cl. Triple Sec or Cointreau 4 wedges of lime squeezed. dash of Grenadine.  - fill to about 3/4 of the glass with Cranberry Juice. - shake furiously. -top the concoction with some 7up/sprite and enjoy.  Now i have a second recipe... the one i make, which is killer - this is meant for monsters who can take the alcohol, cuz there is a lot of it. It is the same as above,  except you add: 2cl. of dark rum, 2cl. of vodka, and another cl. of Triple sec, which brings the alcohol content to 20cl. of alcohol....   More recipes to come - if you have any questions, post your comments and i'll get back to ya. CHEERS!

      "Oh... The euro will be so smart - cause you can go around to all countries in Europe without having to worry about currency exchanges etc etc.." Bullshit !! When I travel around Europe, I usually go to either the UK or Denmark - none of them have signed up for the euro (good for them) - and whether they have or nor it wouldn't matter, as I always pay with my visa card. So let's look at the flip-side on having the Euro...  On the day "they" introduced the euro, all prices sky-rocketed.. And I mean _all_ prices.. The consumers (you and me) were having trouble doing the exchanges in their head when they did their groceries, so by the time they realized the increase - it was too late... And now.. Well now we're just stuck with it !  An example: Back in the good old French Francs days, I would be able to go to my local brasserie and have a couple of pints of Heineken for about 45,- FF (max). Now, it'll cost me 12,50 EUR - let's see.. (12.50 x 6.56)  = 82,- FF - that's an increase on almost 82% - I mean, what the hell ?   I miss the French Francs...    And what the fuck is up with the garbage trucks in rush hour traffic ? One would think, that they have the whole god damn day to collect garbage, why mess with people between 8h00 and 9h00 when they are already late for work... I mean... what's up with that ? &lt;/rant&gt;

      Another on of those days.. *sigh* (Is it Friday yet ?)  Put our new spam-filter/antivirus mail gateway online today.. Seems to work pretty well - Up on until today we used  urlLink Trend Interscan VirusWall for Linux . I have been pretty happy with the VirusWall, but a have wanted to change it for a long time, because: 1. It runs on Linux 2. It costs money  We did not have any spam filtering until now, and frankly, it was about damn time.. Spammers were hitting our mailboxes by the thousands every single day..   Anywho.. I found a nice  urlLink HP  server for the purpose, spent yesterday afternoon installing  urlLink FreeBSD  and doing the basic configuration... Followed by amavisd-new, clamav and p5-Mail-SpamAssassin from the  urlLink ports collection . Did some testing this morning, and finally put it into production at noon.. After running for 20 minutes, it had already caught 29 spam messages !  My friend Henrik is visiting from Denmark, and tonight we are all going out for a nice dinner at  urlLink Anatole  - a small restaurant close to where a live. They make traditional French food, and they make very well ;)

      I recently discovered a little util named  urlLink kblticker . It is a tray-icon application for  urlLink KDE . Basically what it does, is it contacts  urlLink BlogLines  every  x  minutes, and checks to see whether or not I have any unread posts on the blogs I am subscribed to.  This is all good and nice, however I would have liked a feature that would have enabled me to override the  x  minutes interval-check, and verify the status of my subscriptions immediately. I wrote the author, who told me it was a great idea, and he, himself, would like such a feature as well - but unfortunately he was leaving for vacation - but he promised me to add on return... Since the program is open-source, I had access to the complete source code, and after a few changed source files, I could recompile the program with "Poll Now" functionality. Yay ! Even trying to imagine such an operation on a Microsoft application (or other closed-source project) already gives me a headache..   Before:    After:

      Well well, it seems like just 10 minutes ago when i last left this office.. and here i am again! WTF. I mean you leave on Friday saying "I am SO going to take advantage of these two days off", and no matter WHAT you do, it just seems like the weekend is compressed into just a couple minutes, and there you are, your dumb ass sitting in your stupid blue chair, looking at a dirty screen full of crap.. yay!  But what'd ya want to do, that's the way it is. The weekend was good although short as usual. For once my sorry self was invited to a birthday party, which was pretty sweet (yeah i got myself a couple of drinks with mich there) We went and shot some pool for a couple of hours (although we probably shot more heinekens then balls really) and then headed off to Hogans, where we sat, bullshitted, and ate Rota's very own bar-made sandwiches... yum. I got sick of mich after about 60 minutes of listening to his constant moaning and bickering, so we f**ked off to the VD, had a shot with Marko there, and went home to pass out.  Saturday, did nothing (another birthday that evening); Sunday, walked around paris and bought some stuff, went home, had sushi and passed out.  SO here we go for another week of bloggin' excitement!! Go Enterasys! And what about this Sasser virus... i want to see some of these people's computers reboot when they're in the middle of a HUGE document they haven't saved.. heheheheh  Tada!

      Trying to test a Matrix E1 switch today.. That was lots of fun ! We weren't able to figure out how to get console access.. Spent some time trying to search on google for some answers.. But apparently everyone that owns such a switch have not experienced any problems..  We tried connecting a normal rollover console cable, a straight-through cable and a crossover cable - all without success. Figured that it might be hyperterminal that was choking, tried with another terminal program - still without success. Unfortunately the com port on my Unix box is dead, so I am forced to use the windows box - that kinda limits our debugging options..  Finally gave up, and sent it through the system - I can see only two options: 1. Both console ports have been nuked 2. We (Dim & I) are too stupid to get it working.  Since we experienced the same behavior on both switches, I am tempted to believe in the second option... I don't know what it says about us.. Except I hope I'll never have to work with such a piece of crap again.

      Big Burger Challenges Gustatory Gladiators  POSTED: 12:42 pm EDT June 30, 2004 UPDATED: 1:01 pm EDT June 30, 2004 CLEARFIELD, Pa. -- Denny's Beer Barrel Pub has a challenge -- the six-pound Burger Challenge.  The Clearfield, Pa., eatery this week invited big eaters from around the country to take on its biggest burger.  Here's the recipe: six pounds of beef, one large onion, two whole tomatoes, ½ head of lettuce, one and ¼ pounds of cheese, top and bottom buns, and a cup each of mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, relish and banana peppers -- all topped off with some pickles.  The folks at Denny's Beer Barrel Pub says no one has been able to eat the six-pound burger in the required three hours.  Competitive eater Eric "Badlands" Booker has tried it three times. On his last attempt, he stayed at the restaurant for seven ½ hours and ate the whole thing.  Copyright 2004 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      I hate this, this is plain stupid.  This morning i wake up feeling like shit as usual, because i have to get my sorry ass out of bed and to work by nine am. So I take the shower, throw some clothes on, and head out, still half asleep, thinking how horrible this day is going to be. Oh yeah, by the way, I was woken up not by my already annoying alarm clock, but by guess what? a JACKHAMMER rattling away outside my window. GOD DAMN IT!  So anyways, I'm walking to the subway feeling like shit, when i remember that Starbucks is opening today at Odeon, I remember because it was posted on the store yesterday. So I look over and sure enough, the place is lit up, all ready to go. And what better than a nice Mocca Frappuccino to start up the day! So i walk over there and step in, 10 euros at hand, when some Dorky bastard comes up to me and tells me they ... ARE NOT OPEN YET! It's 8:15am, and they open at... 8-fucking-30!!!! So I bitched at him, well I mumbled something obscene at the guy, cuz i was still asleep, and walked away PO.   Here's what i don't get. They open a Starbucks in a prime location right in the middle of the Latin quarter, and the fuckers open at 8:30, when about half the fuckers craving coffee at that time have already taken the subway to get their sad asses to work.. Wouldn't it be a little more logical to open at like 7:30, so they could attract the full monty? I mean jesus! what the hell! Maybe Starbucks, that good old US corporation, has had to deal with our Socialist way of having unions, who knows. In any case I am pissed off. Fucking pissed off. Maybe I'll go over there and bitch.

      I've heard a lot of rumors out there on gmail and it's manner of setting up advertising according to email content, and a lot of people have been bitching about privacy etc. Granted it's a bit less privacy than we're used to on other mail services... or is it? I mean at least Google is honest about how it's planning to sell advertising, but no one can say that Hotmail, or Yahoo, or any other web-based mail hasn't been doing the same for years. I mean do you really think that your hotmail account is for your eyes only? Don't you think there are a couple techies having the time of their lives looking at your private life! Come ON! God knows I'd be looking at inboxes all the damn time - if I could. So I think this whole polemic on gmail and how it's so "bad" for us is full of shit. If you're stupid enough to put your CC information in a banal email, then you deserve to get riped off. I figure email is about getting a message from A to B as efficiently as possible, and gmail does this better than any other web based email I've found. I've had a gmail account now for a week or so, and i find the interface user friendly, efficient, and I actually haven't noticed the advertising yet, so screw it. To me, A) I can send an email in a couple of seconds; B) I've got shitloads of space to store those emails; C) it's free, and; D) the interface rocks.  And to all those not happy about gmail, here's some advice - DON'T get a gmail account!!! It's that fucking easy! and stop bitching, you're fucking annoying me.

      I think that we should have a designated nap time, like in Kindergarden. Do you guys remember those? I mean work should be like kindergarden, you come in, spend a few hours and play with toys, learn a new letter and number, eat, take the NAP and go home. I just remember how damn good it was, to be laying down in that big classroom, with all the blinds down so it was nice and dark, and laying there on your damn rubber mat, you would just dose off for an hour.. that was nice.  I think it would be pretty damn sweet if you could have an hour nap after lunch. I mean you're full of Flamkeuche or Cote de Boeuf, had a bit of wine, some coffee.. your body needs a bit of time to absorb those calories - I mean it's healthy damn it! For our own HEALTH, we should demand a nap time at work. The way it is right now, we're forcing our already fucked up bodies to digest fast (a cigarette doesn't help, you need da sleep), and we still have to pretend we're actually doing something useful. I mean no one is efficient after lunch, I for one am drousy and wouldn't mind curling up in the space under my desk. I mean technically I could do it and not get caught, no one would notice... apart from the occasional snoring...  Plus they just added a new tint on our office windows, so if you turn off the lights and close the blinds a bit, it would be just perfect for you know what ...  fuck.. here we go, back to work.

      Went to the Metallica concert at Parc de Princes last night.. kinda spontaneous, as we drove out the venue without tickets.. The concert had just begun, and we were told that we could not buy any tickets.. Then this small hustler came along, and asked if we wanted to purchase a couple of tickets..  Moments later, we are having great seats in the stadium ! Class..   Metallica, as always, ROCKED ! I haven't seen them since back in the mid-nineties at Gentofte, Denmark. I stopped buying their albums after "The Black Album" - luckily for me, they played a lot of old stuff (eg. Seek & Destroy, Master of Puppets, Battery) - The best track, was clearly "Enter Sandman" the whole stadium just went at it - crazy fucks dancing pogo like there was no tomorrow..

      I was looking at our site statistics.. (not much to look at really) and found the top search queries for our blog:  * Google	zubrovska vodka * Google	ghettoclock * Google	treat turret syndrome * Google	jours ouvres jours ouvrables week days * Google	dvdchezvous * Google	nomatica comments * Google	chicken cacciotore  Personally, I like "treat turret syndrome" and "ghettoclock" - I hope they found what they were looking for..

      Sorry there old Ghettoblog, i've been neglecting you as of lately. I promise i will post some goo on you more often from now on.  WHASSUP everyone! well it's the SAME OLD SHIT! sleep, work, eat, sleep, etc, etc, but we can't complain, we could be growing turnips for .20cents a day in a remote village of Zaire.. Things are a lot more supportable when put into perspective.  Anyways, just wanted to say, I found a pretty good Tech forum, it's really more of a little community, and you can get some useful help off it. If you don't know it, go check it out at  urlLink www.tek-tips.com , get yourself a login and password, and start posting.    urlLink     Taking a couple days off next week for "Fete de la Musique" - usually quite a bit of fun in Paris, seeing people high on X and Coke dancing to some crossbreed techno/deathmetal reggae can only be fun. Planning on having a couple drinks, and walking around the city, providing it doesn't pour down.  I'll be back on here some more, don't get lonely blog, we haven't forgotten ya (fucking fad these blogs).

      They salesreps at our office are using these headsets with their telephones, and recently we ran out.. We purchase batches of them every now and then.. Those industry standard don't come cheap though.. They are about &euro;100 a pop ! Yeah, a ridiculous price for something pretty basic..  The last couple of months, we have changed a lot of them around the office (I don't know what the hell those salesreps are doing with them). Last week, we ran out of new headsets.. We requested upper-management to purchase some new.. Bad call.. When our CEO saw the price on those headsets, he made an unpredictable move. 6 months ago (or so) we tested out Skype for inter-office calls, and for that purpose we bought a shitload of cheapo pc-headsets (those for a couple a euros a piece) -  Yeah.. That's right.. I trip to  urlLink Castorama  later, and Dim and I are sitting and removing mini-jacks from the pc-headsets, combining the them with the connectors from the other headsets.. Electrical-tape, choc blocks (thanks Lasse) and a lot of patience.. A real MacGyver solution..   Result: A working headset for our phones, ugly as hell - for less than 2 euros a pop.  Pictures to follow....

      Well, what do you know. My SD-512MB flash card from  urlLink Nomatica  arrived yesterday.. Well, actually "La Poste" tried to deliver it last Saturday, naturally the office was closed, so they failed in their attempt. We called them Monday; they told us that since they couldn't deliver it on Saturday - the package would be shipped back to the expediter. [Enter rage] After calming down (with beer and food - the only thing that works) - I decided to have Dim calling them again (I was not calm enough) - this time, we actually stumbled upon a savvy postal employee (apparently they *do* exist) - and he opened a "reclamation" with the sorting center etc etc.. That got things moving, so all is good now. Actually they even called me this morning, to confirm that I did indeed receive the package. Bravo Mr. Postal Employee..

      Ahh the summer is coming, and that means vacation for the lucky few of us who : a:) still have some dosh in order to do something other than sit in the apartment and b:)have the days off.. So it is with great joy that i am going (ceterus paribas) to the south of France in August for 2 weeks, and bringing my chick there.   Well check this out, when she went and asked for her vacation time, they told her they would count the Saturday she was taking off (yes, that saturday, the WEEKEND day) as a vacation day...... So lets get this straight:  - She works Monday through Friday, 7 hours a day, for a grand total of 35 legal working hours. - On her paychecks, she gets 2.5 something days off a month, for a grand total of 30 days off per year - the legal 5 weeks vacation in France. - and no, she doesn't work and hasn't worked any Saturday.. and has not had any absences for not being at work on saturdays.  So this is beautiful! I just imagine myself in this situation, where i work all year, monday through friday, and when it comes to taking vacation, they count my saturdays in my vacation days! Isn't the weekend supposed to be free time where you don't work? WTF! When asked about this little rule they have (which in the end helps them out, because you can take less work days off, hence work more for SHIT pay), these people said that it was an internal rule that the director (that bitch) implemented, so they couldn't do shit about it. Well guess what..  I've been investigating the French Law.  And you know what, what they are doing is LEGAL. You see, French companies can actually calculate your vacation time two ways: 1) by the days you actually worked (jours ouvrés) 2) by the days you COULD HAVE WORKED (jours ouvrables). the latter means that even if you don't work on saturday, they can count the saturday in your vacation time...  NOW THIS IS FUCKED UP. The only day they can't take off you is Sunday..... I mean i know this is a lot of fuzz over one day, but imagine how PO you would be if you have to take your saturday as a day in your vacation, when usually it's your weekend anyways and you don't work. And I mean you could try to just take the week days, but you are FORCED take your saturday as well, you have no fucking CHOICE.   I am really starting to hate this fucking place..  But then I looked at my paycheck and saw there was a slight difference. I get 2.08 days off a month for a total of 25 days off a year. Those days are Monday through Friday (5 days) She gets 2.5 days off a month for a total of 30 days off a year. My assumption is that from the beginning, they gave her vacation time on her saturdays, which would make the extra day vacation she gets a month (25/5=5 days of work/vacation; her 30/5=vacation based on 6 working days, hence Mon - Sat.)  I still don't understand why they do this, whatever, fuck it, it's Friday and I don't care, I'm on my weekend in a couple of hours.  That's my bitching for today. I'll have more later - the fumes are still hot.

      Yeah yeah yeah... We are not writing here as much as we want to. If only we could come up with a way where we can blog and do real work at the same time.. oh well, perhaps someday..   Anywho, my ass is outta here.. going a couple of weeks to Denmark to chill out and see family and friends. (and maybe have a beer or two)  "If this blog is rockin' - don't come knockin'" - I'll leave it to Dim..   So, seee ya - adios - ciao..  or as Cartman might put it :   Screw you guys, I'm going hooooome !

      First day Dim is not here, and our backup solution is not working as expected.. well .. perhaps as expected.. it did not back up anything last night. We are using  urlLink ARCserve  on  urlLink MS  - and to no surprise, it blows. Every other day we are obliged to kill some its processes as it fails to shut them down properly. Today was no exception, and on top of that the tape would not eject.. Useless crap.  Managed to drop by  urlLink castorama  in my lunch break, to pick up some wood pillars I need for support in my closet (as the shelf is heavily overloaded, and about to fall down) - wood is good..  Going out to  urlLink Ikea  tonight to look for a small furniture for our kitchen, so I imagine that I'll enjoy myself putting together something tonight - I totally suck at it though. It's kinda like a jigsaw puzzle - but for adults..  On a side note, I'm happy to report that  urlLink GDF  dropped by today and opened for the gas to our apartment, so we are actually able to cook some real food tonight !!

      Well.. It has been way too long since I've bitched about one thing or another, but truth is, I haven't had much to bitch about... Imagine that.. It's a sad state of affairs ! I've been off to Denmark on vacation, and we have moved to our new apartment as well.. I guess I've simply been to occupied to complain.  Anyway, now I'm back at work (damn it), and already now various things are starting to make my piss boil - that coinciding with Dimitri leaving for vacation tonight is not exactly helping out the situation. I know.. yes.. I  know  shit will hit the fan as soon as his dumb ass has left the building.. Printing problems, vira shit, and general PC hardware problems. I've got to be honest with you guys, I'm not one bit too happy about him requiring vacation...  Moving.. god I hate moving. Actually I like it once all boxes/furniture have been moved - but moving heavier-than-titanic furniture (fridge) three floor down is a no-go.. that, all while it is 35 degrees Celsius outside in the burning sun just kills me. It's all done now though.. and I love the place! We just miss a few furniture for the kitchen and then we are all set to go.  Alright, I'd better get back to work.. gotta write that code.. doesn't make much of a difference..
