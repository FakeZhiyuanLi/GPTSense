      today i wasnt feeling very happy becos of some reasons i don wished to be named... then .. we went to the senoko power station... i don noe y.. i just felt tat it's a waste of time... the speaker dont even noe wat is his next sentence or hu will be starting the whole tour... i just felt tat they are quite disorganised... Or maybe it's becos of my mood today... when i reach school... tw and sy were waiting for me at the lobby and after tat we went to the kfc ... firstly i was feeling very moody and don intented to laugh but when tw asked y am i so moody and is it becos im having pms or sumthing... then he starting tokingt left me a bit guilty. but i really wanna go. go where. go cell group. i felt that it was time that i shld go. to participate in their activities.
