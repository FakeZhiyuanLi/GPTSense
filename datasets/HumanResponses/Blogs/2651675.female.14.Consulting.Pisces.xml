      oh walls of pink and orange leave me to write, to live, to love. and blinds let the light shine in just enough to see my pen dance in the reflections of you, your beautiful light could make anyone dance and sing. i love your silly antics of nothing and your thoughts of everything your like light, your neccesary to me you are a need, you are my life, you are a rant, you are a love, you make my pen dance in your beautiful light never leave me. oh light you are me.

      writings in the dark, no glare, no light, so much life.  the only light is the alarm clock, and the street light that creeps through the blinds with such a brilliance it is like an unending light that is dark and has so much feeling. the green light of the alarm clock glares off my pen to make reflections on you, you piece of paper i can write to you and noone can care. i can see the outline of the hulk on my sheets and thats it. this soft music helps me to write to you, i can barley stay awake anymore to see the faces of this life drown into certain places of myth and leave us. please leave this place now and make room for the good ones leave us in peace, in health, in love.

      the lightening flases into my room through the blinds with such a flash it glares into my eyes like a little kid going through a light house. could it be that these are the random flashbacks of longing for certain people? this life is great who could leave it i love this world i love this life.

      his poetic soul withers away  like he he is gone  he is lost lost forever in this endless world the world that rejects him the world that hates him the supposidly understanding world we turned on him he is so small he carrys this tremendous hate on this shoulders always and forever until he cuts it loose cuts his life away from the pain and ends his damned life. he has a new life now a better one he isnt tormented  he is loved yet,he was always loved he just couldnt tell.

      as i listen to the torments of his life  as i hear his goodbyes as the sun fades into the clouds as i see him running from the pain he hides it under his pillow his pillow is a place for his secrets  he lays apon them everynight and keeps the pain close to his heart  his love is male and so is he he feels the rejection of family and piers and crys he crys rivers onto the tears that any of us cry he is sadden by the thought of he he is him and thats all he needs to see           i dont think i like that poem does oit even make since?

      a stack of blank cd's to burn your memories on a mirror on the wall to look at yourself and remember a printer on a desk to write the letter a bottle of water in the fridge to qunch your thirst a box of kleenex to dry the tears a tablet of tylenol to cure the pain a sip a gin to give you a little buzz a blanket to warm your cold feet a loved one to sit beside you a picture for them to rember you by a heart for the pain to churn a bed for the rest of your life.

      As the world revolves around me like one of those fall leaves cought in a wind cyclone taking off at a moments notice.I realize i am not alone in this world. There are many things around me that i never notice.Maybe its just the slight bit of cough syrup i just took or my mind has opened up to new and wonderful thoughts and feelings. All these things just make you think how small you are. I mean can we belive there is no other life around us? can we! do we have the oudasity to say that we are the only living things in this universe?You know we are like the tip of a needle in this whole entire universe just the tip.WERE NOTHING!. were one planet, in one solar system out of 100's, in one gallexy out of millions,all in one universe. We are so small. How can we even start to judge a thing like this, is it even possible? is it?  it might jUSt mystify me, but god, doesnt it just seem outrageously real?maybe a little to real.

      sorry to a dear friend   andrew im sorry i cussed you out and all that jazz. im really sorry i hurt you. im really sorry i even told!im really sorry!  i guess i just was worried that your depressed its not something im saying to sagitate you i swear. id probubly make up worst things.  i DONT want this friendship to end! its not like they can just die there always there. like when you blow out a stick that on fire, there is still a lttle bit of flame and if you care for it and nurture the little flame it gets bigger and brighter and is the same as it was before!and thats how our friendship should be  we had good times. maybe i did get annoying and maybe i was mean but really thats me. i do that. thats lena and i have lost friends doing that but not a close friend like you. unlike the other time i want to be friends again  i really dont want it to end?

       so sorry i didnt write yesterday didnt feel the need i guess   so Friday: school is fun we went to lemays class for some science demo type thing. it looked like poo. then i talked to andrew on the computer he still wont talk to me, and it's really dumb. i think he is just acting really imature, he should just give it up. but im not sure why is he mad at me now, i told people 2 months ago! i think that it might be something else, and that its not that i told people.In fact he thought it was quite funny(or it looked like he was laughing) when i told him i talked to mr. williams about it!i guess he didnt think it was that funny.seriously i think its something else, but im really not sure. after the long conversation of him dissing me in every way,face, or form and me just trying to apologize(not replying back w/diss's because thats below me)he still would not accept my apology well i think he acepted it but he wont be my frined, does that even make since?things still havent returned to normal   i sure wish they would though....  after that EILEEN!! came over we had a great time(except for when she ran into the sliding glass door and spilt ginger ale everywhere)hey eileen? when was the last time you let your slaves loose? hehehe thats great, but still not as great as the barbie dolls one!  so after we ordered a veggie lovers pizza, we(well eileen) tryed to call andrew but he didnt answer, he probubly thought it was me because it was coming from my house. well anyways we had a fun game of truth, or truth over instant messenger. it was really fun except for the fact that he was being abnoxious and rude to me. we told him i wasnt in the room for the first part of the conversation, but i was, and we knew that he knew, because he kept being like we should go see headwig(or whatever it is) w/ o lena and things like that. i dont think that eileen though it hurt me that much but it kind of did.then there was the whole HOT thing and he was like your hot! NOT YOU LENA! and its like dude! DO? i need you to give me this info? see i have these devices called mirrors!(you should get one there great!)  after that thing calmed down for the most part, i guess i actually felt like we were friends again till he made another wise crack! but then he started to fish for complements saying he was fat and ugly and thats when eileen left for a minute, and i talked to him. he didnt know it was me though, but he was like thanks so much that was like the best compliment ever! AND I WAS LIKE WHAT!?!?all i said was you should like yourself for who you are not what othere people think.(well it was better then that but you get the just of it) and i no he just said that to make eileen feel good, but he was like "wow thats a compliment if i ever heard one!"or something like that but then eileen wouldnt say that it was me but it was.  oh well i just want to be friends again, i mean its not like i like him. plus you could tell if i still liked him by my way of reacting to him and eileen. if i still liked him i wouldnt probubly  never speak to eileen again! but im still talking to her!  I miss sara i havent seen her in like along time! i feel like doing something w/ juliann and jecca tonight i need to call them later!  eileen kept telling me my personality last night, and was like your so differnt and stuff. because i dont like to read and i dont really enjoy ALOT of musicals, i like stuff like lion king and hairspray and fun stuff but i dont like all that depressing shit!i dont member what else but it was like some weird words(not angst though even though i am or wait cant you be angst?) like extrovert and shiz like that i dont know. im gonna blog in like a while but im gonna again today so yeah buh bye!

       so today im just happy people are like why is you so happy you should be mad and angry but surprisingly enough im happy out the mo'! i have no clue why!well i kinda do i guess im happy that me and andrew arnt friends anymore. i feel really relived i dont have to worry about that pain in the ass anymore who cares if he might be depressed i dont have to worry about it anymore! i guess im a little stunned that they(eileen and andrew) are going out but no big deal. i kinda feel like calling andrew and being like why are we doing this to each other its a tad childish do ya think? because we have both told our most biggest secret  fuck all those homophobes out there yall are so muthafuckin ass fucks! and thats no joke! ok so back to my wonderfully happy day! i got a 45 on a LoTF quiz and i didnt read it and when i did it was a 25 so im a little happy about that. oh but then in jackson urg i got a fucking 40 because i though he said to round so i rounded before i multiplyed silly me so oh well. then math i got a 79 yay!i thought i was gonna fail! then clapsadle i passed notes w/eileen the whole period like i usually do the we flew some kick ass airmuffers(planes) and yeah then my locker jammed because some mutherfuckin people closed it then choir wheere we SANG!!! it was fantabulous! well so anyways i keep waiting for eileens blog i no she is gonna write like 10 pages i just know it i have this inner feeling! oh and yeah my aol sucks

      i guess im ok?   Guess what i found out last night(eileen im not mad so dont feel bad ok) i found out eileen was gonna ask andrew out.i was like WHAT?!?!!.wow that was a shocker i also found out that andrew,my used to be bestfriend,hates me he says he has lost my respect and trust. oh well its his loss, i guess? after my huge long disscusion w/ eileen online last night i think she might think im depressed or something,IM NOT! but eileen i really love talking to you its fun i havent really talked to anyone in a long time.it felt good. ok back to the whole andrew and eileen bit. of course he is gonna say yes eileen! duh.. why would you even think he isnt. thats serious crazy talk. hey but eileen we need to do something friday unless your gonna do something w/ andrew if he says yes(which he will)!  ok so im somewhat mad. im more upset about him hating me than him going out w/eileen.i dont understand ok i told 2 people and sara told 2 people why is he mad at me and not at sara? i guess he has always not liked me and now that he has a reason he is taking it way way to far.(ahh the band-aid)*ouch* hehehe it took off the last of my tan! ahhh its so funny!OK! back to my ranting.  but seriously i guess im not as mad as i am scared i dont know why im scared though i guess its a mix of him saying yes and them being a couple.*bad thoughts*AHHHH! im real scared now. i might be a little mad at first but then ill get over it.  holy shiz! ok so im walking from my orthodontist to mcdonalds because that is where my grandpa waits to pick me up well as im walking like hobo man walks by me and is like "hey gorgeuos" i didnt know if i was supposed to be flatterd or scared.  i have that damn brittany spears song "toxic" in my head its a good song though i think i might have to get the CD.

Ok so sometimes im not the funnest person to be around but shit yall what the fuck?im so pissed and ive called like 3 other people and there either baby sitting or not home.it sucks! science is on but its awaymessage is glowing so I cant talk. I need to though.  Maybe Morgan doesn't like me? Maybe I wasn't good at acting yesterday? Maybe because I kept being all like I usually am? U I hate wondering I feel like I have lost all my friends at least when I was w/the preps I felt like I fit in and was loved and did stuff every night maybe yall are just a curse. I know all this sounds angst but I am angst and I hate it. If I could choose one person to be like in school it would be, you know what I have no clue but well ok. What im about to say will be really queer but, I miss being popular I don't have as many people saying hey to me or wanting to walk down the hall w/me. I think they are scared of me. And that scares me. Maybe its something that yall like . People being scared to talk to you is not what I like.    I go up to one of my old friends and then start talking,as the rest of the group approaches I am slowly pushed back and out of the group.I USED TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ALL. I don't like it now and sometimes IM embaresed because I hang out w/yall like at lunch. When yall sing,  i long to be at the other table where the only time we sing is,well we never sing. But we just would laugh at random things. I don't know?   BLAH I really hate this because now if all yall read this yall are gonna be mad at me. Well who cares isn't everyone already. Or do I always just think that they are? Ive been told that I do, but whenever someone looks at me funny I guess I just all of a sudden assume they are. I feel that my life is just to complicated.   oh I just remeberd something that im still mad at my mom about well ok so this winter I went to Chattanooga  I (screw spell cherck beyond this point) told everyone it was just to spend christmas but it wasnt. it really was to go see my dads grave which i hadent seen in 8 years. well so we went to see it and in all the pictures i have sunglasses on not because it was bright but to hide my tears. its pretty sad but oh well but after we get home my mom goes "well at least we have another family picture w/all of us" how mean. and when eileens dad said that stuff i was about to cry again because that statment sounded like what your dad was saying uh.IT HURT!  is a blog supposed to be anything like a diary?  I HATE HOW ANGSTY I AM  eileen i need to just get w/you and talk one day because i dont know i just do

       Yeah i dont know if i like this dark backround on my blog it makes my page look really depressing oh well. so it saturday and im bored i rode my bike(well my brothers) to chases but then(after me and katie went to a porn site then ran to her house to hide from chase) he got mad at me then i left. so now im just at home waiting for either caycee or jeccanboo to call me back to do something today. i really wanna go to the mall but ehh not as much as i wanna just hang around the house and moop around you know sometimes mopping can be pretty soothing oh well i really gtg so till next time buh bye

       Sorry I had to post I thought my AOL was gonna die but back to the subject  like i hang out w/the writers and good english people who enjoy reading books and im really not like that but i feel like i fit in. its crazy but maybe you just need some variety in groups like w/the preps there fun and i do enjoy being w/them its just i feel like i have to be pretty or prove my self to them and i dont like that. maybe being pretty once in a while is fun and okay, but to do it everyday is hard and makes you a stereo type. well uhh who cares right. eileen is always like being a cutter or thinking of killing yourself is angst but if every teenager thinks of it because everyone does or most. does that make us all complete angst? uhh i have so many questions but writing feels good. exept my grammer sucks and there is little or no capitalizations oh well  holy shiz! mrs.bordelon is like chillen bring your things for the project, and what the hell are we supposed to bring urga

Eileen im so sorry about being all URGish today its just that well ive been really short tempered and i dont know why. HOLY SHIT!! ok so im waiting for my mom to pick me up from your house and the real reason i left was i was super tired i could barly stand and i needed to be alone because i was just getting annoyed of everyone as a whole. but anyways you dad comes up to me and is like so its the aneversary of your dads death! and im liike yeah *fake smile* it was crazy. did you say something to make him say that? well im not mad at you eileen trust me.  hey eileen your the only one who reads this right? tell me in your blog if so because i think im just gonna writre to you.  i always feel so angsty! i dont know if thats bad hell i dont really know what angst is but if its anything like degrassi which i know it is then i am total angst. i always feel like im hanging around w/the wrong group of people

      “We then I”  As we walk down the halls laughing and telling jokes of the night before We don’t worry of our friendship being broken in half Were just like normal friends, laughing about normal things I never thought of the doom heading straight for me  We tell secrets not to be told We talk about people whom we like and dislike We share our thoughts and feelings We is the key word  We always did stuff on Friday night Even Saturdays we would spend together I lost all my friends  He was the only one I liked being with I don’t think the story was the same with him  I guess he found me annoying I guess I called him to much I guess i was to angst I is the keyword I broke up the friendship  I wish it had turned out different I wish we had grown apart Yet wishes don’t always come true The break up was harsh  The break up was because I lied I told I wasn’t becoming   Now I am just here thinking about the friend I used to have  Thinking of why I had to tell the secrets Thinking of why I had to lie so much Thinking of why I had to be so unbecoming of a young lady  Just thinking and hoping he’ll come around  And be friends just once more.     just a clue poem....its bad.....i guess....sara's liked it.......its for andrew........oh well.....

       i ahve so much to blog it isnt even funny i really cant rember what happend the past week. it was kind of like i was in a daze all through school. i only rember wanting to be mad at someone but i couldnt find someone to be mad at. i tried to be mad at eileen but she had done nothing...not a thing.....wrong......so i felt bad. i couldnt find anyone to blame my sorrow on. but last night at around 4:40 i called andrew tried to get him to be my friend but failed miserably again. He said,"he didnt like me as a friend anymore"and the same old stuff he says everytime,"he lies,what you told people,and etc.". i guess ive gotten over it. though it still haunts me that 2 people so close could be torn apart. i feel like he has no remorse. it used to hurt but i guess ive grown to it. ive just got a bit upset over the subject recently because at winterfest he said we were sort of friends again...and now he says he must have been insane to have said that. i think the whole dilema is just us acting like children instaed of civilized people.o after the failed attempt i watched the tube and fell fast asleep, only to awake at 3:30 roll around in my bed and go back to sleep.i feel realy pitiful right now just ranting on and on about my life. today eileen told me i was rich.......it hurt.......IM NOT!....thats probubly the thing that bugs me the most just because we keep our house nice people automaticly assume we are rich. yet, the thing that bugged me the most about the conversation was the"im not rich either."statement. wow i was about to pop her in the kisser when she blurted that one out.like hell she isnt rich her moms side might not have alot but her dads side sure has a pretty penny or two. it doesnt matter if you are only there half of the time you still have it in your life. please dont get mad at me for saying this but golly girl your loaded!(sorry if that offended you) but you will probubly never even read this......noone reads this.......uhhh.......not even sara or morgan. i think morgan doesnt like me i think she has heard bad things. i really like morgan i think sjhe is really really sweet and nice.well i dont feel like blogging anymore........

      Hey, last night i ahd a good convorsation, with an old friend it was nice to talk about that subject that we talked about. I mean sometimes its just really really hard to get over it, and it was nice that i could talk about it.  Im still not sure what my punishment is. Its along the lines of 1hour of studying everynight.....and practicing golf everyday really wimpy punish me.  Man-o-man, yall y'know what? Im seriously tired of yall calling me dumb as a joke.....I mean I do make bad grades, but you dont have to rub it in. I  know that its is just joke,but come on guys it hurts!  EILEEN READ YOUR MAIL!  So in better news,well there is no better news.I really feel like writing a buch of things,but I dont know what to say.Do yall every get those urges just to write up a storm? I do,a lot its just a Lena thing i guess.  I got home yesterday and cryed my eyes out. Then I called my mom and told her about the grade.I also told her that Mrs.Stallins was an insane child of satan,and that she wouldnt raise my grade 1.1pts to make it a C. Mrs.Stallins can go fuck herself, because we all know she has a penis! "I think that was quite possibly the worst comeback EVER!"  damn damn damn  Im going golfing with caycee today! We all need to start practiceing our bowling skills if we are gonna make the team. I think girls have to bowl a 115 or a 100 and guys have to bowl 130-150 not sure the guys might be higher.Acctually i know the boys is higher just not sure what it is.   Damn, y'know im really tired of this whole "not talking to each other and hating each other and making fun of each other" _____ship that me and andrew have, its so fucking dumb.I wish the whole situation would just die and be dead and we would leave eac other alone!I'm not mad just a little frustarated with the whole ordeal.  Mrs.Clapsadle called people terds!  woooooooooooo  my hands hurt!

      so today monday i am sick. i slept till like 11:40 then i got online and who should i see EILEEN! yay we both arnt at school together poor sara moore she is probubly all alone in mrs stallins class w/o us.so i like this new template i think it is mighty fine. i thought ergolyes was really good i missed brad i havent seen him since charlottes web well i have seen him like at the mall but i never said hay. his hair looks nice highlighted he should be a model!   the tears from my eyes poor like rain from the sky the intensity is over now. its time to walk back walk back from the tradgedy that has frosaken this place the walls falls, the lights brake, the ground rumbles my little perfect world is torn apart in a matter of minutes the sky is full of dust,so is my heart i await the day when things will be normal again but i know in my heart they will never be. for i have lost you in all this rubble,you are now not love you are now pain.

Your flaws: Loudness, jealous tendency, need for attention..

        You belong in the land of darkness, otherwise known as one of the worlds in which I dwell. All here is beauty inspired by tragedy and great sorrow. Write or go through other creative outlets to express the anguish you may be feeling, and never let anyone tell you that you are just being 'weepy' or full of 'teenage angst'(if you're a teenager.If not, then they really should be punished for calling you one. They probably are trying to insult your maturity...fools.)and always remain yourself, dark and amazing. Never change.    urlLink   Where do you belong?(ANIME IMAGES)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

        You are Bugs Bunny  You are fun, friendly, and popular. You are a real crowd pleaser. You have probably been out on the town your share of times, yet you come home with the values that your mother taught you. Marriage and children are important to you, but only after you have fun. Don't let the people you please influence you to stray.     urlLink   Which Cartoon Character are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
