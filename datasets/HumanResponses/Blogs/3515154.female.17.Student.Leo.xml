      Wow...today was an eventful day...Not really. I barely talked to David :( Deeann isnt moving in with Ian until her birthday, but they did stay together last night, and she sounded like she was so happy...they are gonna be so happy living together! I talked to Dustin and Micheal some more today...Jessica's home!! Thank gosh!! I was about to go crazy! Its kinda storming right now...I really don't like stormy weather, ever since the wreck thunder frightens me. Where is David...I miss him. I'm head over heals over that boy, I love him so much...ah...he has won my heart. I think that Dustin and his band are really gonna go far, Dustin has a great voice and can really play the guitar...all they need is a Drummer...lol!   Music I'm listening to now: I'm moving on By: Rascal Flatts  Thats a really great song. Tomorow I am going up to the school to work ojn some of my make up work...Especially biology. And to get my review sheets...Whitesboro is really bad about getting your work to you when you ask for it. I mean Mrs. Cheney told me that she would get reviews from all my classes and give them to David but did she? NO...he only got one and I already had that one!! They did the same thing to me right after the wreck.   My mood right now: Longing...I miss David...but I'm also in a good mood...that just generally is me tho...lol  Back to my day...hopefully David will come over before work tomorow, and on break tomorow...Erik is home today! I don't know where hes been but its definately been different without him on the net all the time, Cuz I talk to him about alot of stuff. Ive been wondering where Tim is?! TIM WHERE ARE YOU!?! I really wanna get out...go to the pool...go somewhere...I cant stand being at home all day every day and I cant see how anyone can do that!! AH I might get to be in a band! Victor Smith(excuse me if I spelled anything wrong in that) is going to give me violin lessons, as yall know I already play, but he's givin me lessons so I can get better. And his band is looking for a singer, so of course my mom told him that I sing and he wants to hear me sing!! How awesome is that? This is like a once in a lifetime chance, well not really cuz I'm sure if i wanted to I could be in Dustin and Micheal's band!! I wish David would call me back!! Grrr... Dont you hate it when guys do that...GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!! Guys confuse me at times...lol.   "I'm full of fly shit"--Dustin Mozingo  Thats one of the famous quotes of this day...not really its just a really funny story behind it.  Its back to the doctor for me on thursday...which I really cant wait cuz once mama sees that my results are negative i can go out and have fun!! That is until I have the surgery...wow this has been a long post...If any thing eventful happens tonight, I'll come write another one for today...Love yall!!

      I am bored and I'm gonna tell ya about my day yesterday... Well...my day started off with me talking to Deeann on the phone for a while...She was moving all her stuff that she had packed the night before out in the yard so when Ian came they could just load it up and go. Then, I was on the net for a while and David got on and read the email that i wrote him...it was a very long one. So then later yesterday afternoon David came over! He suprised me...lol I was actually in my room trying to call him when he drove up!! We had alot of fun and he soaked me with my squirt bottle so to get him back i spray painted his hair orange and black and gold! hahaha! We went outside and played football and did some other stuff;)I can't wait until next school year, so that we can go out again, Because I Really  LOVE  David. So then, David left and Dustin and Micheal called me...lol which really shocked me cuz I didnt think they were ever gonna call me! I talked to them for a while and I talked to David for a little bit on the phone and then I talked to Dustin and Micheal some more and then...Deeann came over!! I got to see her and I also got to see Ian and Ross...Its been a while since I saw Ross seeing as he lives in Celina! So after they left I got back on the phone with Dustin and Micheal and Dustin ate a fly...lol those boys are crazy!! Then I called David and we talked for about an hour or so, which was the longest we've talked in a long time, and then I got sleeepy and went to bed. During the course of yesterday I really upset Zach, which, I'm sorry about that, but I dont want to take back anything that I said to him. Oh and WAY TO GO CALVIN!! He got a 1 at state! And Jessica you need to get ur BOOTAY home...I gots stuff to tell ya CHIKA!!! Oh and DeeAnn..I miss ya already....YOU BETTER CALL ME ASAP!!!

      This is Crazy....Ive been so bored...no one has been home...GRRRR ppl...Today was one of those days where you just want to sleep all day. I didn't get to talk to David today...*sniff*Sniff* He leaves for Arkansas tomorow!! That means I have to wait a week before I get to talk to him again! Everyone is going away on Vacation and its crazy...No one here to talk to! Finally tomorow I am going to the Doctor and he better say that I'm better or else!! I'm serious!so... MY DAY Well someone called at 3am and woke me up 3 times...which I got mad cuz I was sleepin. DARN YOU! and then Of course I got woken up at 7:30 when Debbie brought Maggie over. I went back to sleep and got woken up again when Dee called me at 9 ish and then the DANG street sweeper came at like 11:00 and woke me up again! So I'm kinda cranky cuz I didnt get much sleep! ARG! So then I talked to DeeAnn and we talked for a little bit...Nothing eventful really...the Cat has been coming around me more lately..I think shes jealous of Maggie...cuz When the baby is over here She doesnt get any attention from Heidi so...Man I'm in love and I dont have the person that I love around me...of course you know the object of my affection is David Alan Hunter...and I will never ever ever lose my love for him...holy poop I love him alot. Well this evening it stormed and ever since the wreck I've been afraid of thunder so I was off to myself in my room while it was storming...Man I really have a boring life...I want to go see Harry Potter on Friday, but I have NO one to go with...which sucks. Hopefully David and I are still going to go see the day after tomorow cuz i really want to see it!!Anyways it finally quit storming, and I finally got to get back on here. But thats about all I'm gonna write about today because it royally sucked!! Sleepy time...

But today...Today is a different story...lol  My Day   Well...It started off this morning with us just staying here while Mama and Johnny took Mamaw to the Doctor. Then we went to the pool...Wow the pool...Well it all started out well...then all the guys were fighting over me! Ive never been faught over before!! Ok so I'm hangin out with Cody, Justin, Spud and Toby. Jamie, Krista, and Raymond are there and they are around with us also. Well...Cody and I got to talking and He would protect me when anyone would mess with me which I thought was really cool so i Hung around with him more. Toby Got jealous and kept trying to take me away...and then Cody would save me! Spud would get in there and try to get me too...lol it was fun and all...Cody was all over me...hehe I think someone likes me...Only problem is that he is with Jennifer...and I dont want to ruin Mine and Jenn's friendship because of a guy...Thats just not cool. Cody and I got in trouble for PDA at the pool...he got my number from me and even invited me to the bowling alley tonight!!I dont want any of this stuff to put mine and David's relationship into a bad place...cuz i really love David and I cant help what other guys do...hehe!So anyways...I get home and I talked to Tim for a while on the phone, and I met Keiths GF Tasha...shes really cool...we have alot in common. I'm hoping Cody will call me sometime he is a really cool guy and would be a great friend I think. Well...I am going to make this short tonight...My sunburn is KILLING me!!!
