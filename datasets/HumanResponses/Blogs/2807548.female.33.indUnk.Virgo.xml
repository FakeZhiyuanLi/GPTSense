        Part Three    So, there I am, deeper in the Abyss than ever before, fearful that perhaps this time I will not make it out. Above me I can just see a thin line slightly lighter darkness that heralds the way out to the real world. I hear echoes of voices calling to me but they are distorted by the darkness and I cannot understand all of their meaning. They seem to be encouraging me but I cannot be sure, as many other things I thought have turned out false of late.   What brought me here? What tipped me over the edge, to fall and fall, like Gandalf and the balrog, or Alice and the White Rabbit? Many who know me would put the blame firmly on my job, and I have let them think that. My job put me under enormous strain. I could work all day like a slave with a whip to her back, and at the end of it, there would be no difference in the amount of work left to do. The proof is this is that I was replaced by three people, as the first replacement screamed that there was too much work for her to do. I had been saying that for the best part of two years but I had been consistently ignored. A woman had been employed to be my assistant but her training started with me showing her how to switch on her PC. Trying to teach her how to use first the PC and then the computerised accounting system took so much time out of my working day that I soon fell even further behind. She had never done any accounting before, and refused to audio type. Well, there was no point in my handwriting letters for her to type, as I could type them myself faster than I could write them legibly. She was a slow learner, who would repeatedly ask the same questions over and over again. At least she was a pleasant companion with a jolly sense of humour.   But while my job did give me spells of depression and I was often tremendously stressed, it did not push me over the edge of the crevasse. I was playing a dangerous balancing game, true, but I managed to keep my footing. There were times of depression but they were usually sparked by a particularly stressful day and were outnumbered by the times I felt good and happy.  Perhaps it was boyfriend trouble then? Ah, no, sorry to disappoint. I had been in a relationship which had proved to be fundamentally unsatisfying but I had ended it many months before and acquired a new boyfriend. We had some teething troubles, the new man and I, but even so I was happier than I had been in years. It made up for the awfulness of work, as he brightened my whole life. It was not the kind of relationship I was used to but I have never felt so loved and so wanted. He still makes me feel the same now.

        Part Two    Many are those who ape Winston Churchill and call their depression the black dog that haunts their life. Mine is an abyss, which calls to me with offers of sweet, warm oblivion in its darkest depths. How many times have I fallen? I no longer count them, but my fingertips should be raw and bloody forever because of the effort to pull myself back up to the world. This last time though, I fell deeper than ever before, down to a place where darkness and blackness have no meaning, because there has never been light there.   Many depressed people kill themselves, and people say they don’t understand the urge to suicide. It isn’t an  urge , it is a  need , created by the illness, a symptom of the illness. It is a voice that whispers sweet blandishments all the day long, and oh! how it soothes, how it  tempts !  I know, though, that this voice is not me, that I do not want to die. It is a primordial battle between light and dark, and I have fought this battle since I was thirteen. That’s twenty years I’ve lived with this voice, waiting for my weakest moments to hint that the oblivion of death is the solution to the life that injures my soul. For this first ten years I fought alone, without aid but now I take the weapons offered to me – the drugs which weaken the power of that insidious voice in my head. It does not make the battle any easier, or any quicker, but it does increase my chances of success.   But what, you ask, of friends to stand by your side while you fight for your life? Very few will take up such a stance, the merest handful in fact. Of the rest, once called friend, some choose not to see in the hope that when the battle is done, you will accept their excuses. Others take up the standard for the enemy and add to the burden you bear, all the while justifying their betrayal. There will be no excuses accepted this time, no pardons will offered.   But those who kicked me when I was down, and ground my face into the dirt failed to realise one vital fact – I always get back up. In twenty years I have not succumbed, and I will not succumb now.

        Part One    It's been two years since my breakdown, and many things are becoming clearer in my mind. My ideas on what is and is not important have changed, and I am still getting used to all those changes. I have another, ongoing blog, where my day to day trials are chronicled, but this is more of a record of where I  have  been, rather than where I am now.   There are those who would hide their heads in the sand even if their arses were on fire. Those who are proud of their inability to notice what is going on around them, no matter what cost this may have on others. I am sickened by all this pretense, all these feeble excuses and lies. I've been down this road before, and then I just swallowed back my bile and did my best to forget. I've been warned not to burn my bridges, but many of these bridges have already been chopped away from beneath my feet. There is nothing of value I can lose by doing this, and maybe I will even gain something.  There will be talk of betrayal and poltroons, of love and protection, and much reference to terror and death. Let those who glibly recite their rehearsed excuses in my direction beware, for I have much to say and very few scruples left.

        Part Four    I’ve been told to not say anything I might regret. I think I’m beyond that mostly. I’ve been living in fear of my own shadow for so long now that a little extra fear won’t add much to my load. This is my safety valve, I think, where I can spew out my anger and hurt in relative safety.  I’ve been thinking about lies, both the ones we tell others, and the ones we tell ourselves. I try not to lie to myself about anything major, just the little ones such as “there is nothing to be afraid of”. I mean, if you can’t be honest with yourself, is there any point?   I have little respect for those who lie and then, when they get caught out, continue to deny the lie beyond the point of believability. Sometimes it amuses me, sometimes not. Smeagol, for example, has the expression he always uses when he’s being less than honest. Midget Fink seems to be incapable of lying believably. I don’t think that I’m a particularly good liar, but at least I put some effort into it. Try to vary my ‘lying face’ a bit, that kind of thing. I only really care when a lie does me damage, and the liar won’t admit to the lie.  It’s all part of the nature of friendship. I expect people to lie to me on occasion. It is, after all, human nature to be dishonest. If I think someone can’t be trusted then I don’t tell them anything I won’t mind being spread around. Usually though, if I think someone is that untrustworthy I will spend as little time with them as possible. I see little value in the friendship of the ‘no secret is safe’ kind of person. Some things aren’t secret, but discretion should be used anyway. For example, if a flatmate has a medical problem of an embarrassing, personal nature, should one turn it into an anecdote for the amusement of others? Should one relate this anecdote to a crowd of people in one’s local role-playing shop? In graphic detail, saying the cause of the problem is the flatmate’s lack of hygiene, with even more graphic detail? I have always found it distasteful, using another person’s life as currency to ingratiate oneself with others. This particular episode, with Fat Fink as the raconteur, made me feel as sick as other incidents have, but I said nothing. Jay convinced me that she should be pitied, that she had to behave like this to be the centre of attention because of her insecurity.   On another occasion she told me a lovely little tale of how she and her boyfriend had searched the flatmate’s room, looking for blackmail material. They didn’t just go into his room and look around. They went through his drawers, poked around under his bed, looked through his sketch books. When they found things they thought were incriminating, it was too good a joke to be kept to themselves. I know of least three people they told, as the height of hilarity. I think it is terribly sad that a person feels they have to keep their sexual preferences secret. I think it is disgusting when another person broadcasts those preferences to all and sundry as the best joke ever. Especially when that gossip persists in describing herself as the subject’s best friend.   Jay felt sorry for her because she kept telling him “pity me” stories, so we had to invite her & her boyfriend round. They were so miserable, apparently. This was a prime case of soft heart ruling head. He didn’t like either of them, and I didn’t trust the woman and knew nothing of her man. Jay thought she was stupid and ignorant, and that her man was arrogant. That was, of course, before it was made clear that in order to be friends with another couple one had to be friends with these two. Suddenly Jay could tolerate their company when previously it had always been a horrendous trial. That is a lie to oneself and to others, I believe.   I know he regretted inviting her to join our Sunday night game, with her constant talk of her character’s breasts and her flaunting her own cleavage as a example of how her character was going to make friends and influence people. She would take up so much game time describing her aerobics outfit, the sweat droplets between her tits, and how all the men in the vicinity would not be able to take their eyes off her fleshy mounds. She wanted lycra in the seventeenth century, for crying out loud. I know role-players are supposed to be playing out the kind of things they’d like to do if they had the money/figure/guts, but this was ridiculously awful. Jay wanted to her to leave the group but couldn’t work out how to arrange it without causing nastiness all round. We had a huge sigh of relief when she stopped playing.

        Part Six    I spend too much time alone. There are days when, if it weren't for my dearest phoning me, I would not have spoken to anyone. What worries me is this: how well I have adapted and how difficult I now find it to spend any length of time with other people.   I used to spend my days surrounded by people, and time by myself was precious. Now I find weekends stressful because for two days there are other people here most of the time. I used to get very lonely, but I don't seem to notice that as much there days. Perhaps because of the time I spend online?   I have always been very frightened of living alone, but now I long for my perfect solitude. It is the longing which frightens me. There have been many changes over the past two years and I think this may be one of the most profound.   It contributes as well to the change wrought by the therapy I have had. I really see no reason why I should spend time with people whose company I don't enjoy or look forward to. I used to put up with all kinds of bollocks because I didn't want to be alone or lonely. If someone's company leaves me cold, or actually makes me feel sick, why should I spend time with them? Even if I have known them a long time. Some friendships are nothing more than a habit, a bad one. I have been trying so hard to learn new ways of thinking and behaving in order to facilitate my recovery. I was told at the outset that people - friends - may not like these new ways, and they would leave my life as a result. Well, I didn't have many friends to lose by that point, as so many just didn't want know someone with a mental illness. I wasn't told that these changes might mean that I wouldn't want or even like some of the people in my life any more. The only regret I've experienced so far is that I have  wasted  so much time on these people, both the ones who left me, and the ones I'm leaving.

        Part Five    It isn't that I'm anti-social.  I just don't like you.  After all, what have you done lately to justify my liking you?

        Part 8    It's the end of an era, I suppose. Jay and I have lived together for eight years or so. About that, anyway. Our friendship survived our break-up even. This last few months it seemed as though our friendship was finished. It probably is now. I don't expect that I will ever see much of Jay again.  So much damage has been done to our relationship by other people. I don't really trust him any more. They said that they didn't tell him to lie to me, but when they make him promise to not tell me things, how else is he to account for his time? For eight years of our relationship, Jay only told me two lies, then about two and half years ago, he was lying to me on a regular basis. Did he think I wouldn't notice?   Anyway, it's all over now. I just have to think about getting through the next wee while as I adjust to living alone. It does frighten me but I am used to fear. Going outside frightens me. There are many nights when I sleep with the light on because I fear the dark. I even sleep with the radio on to mask all noises. I still wake up screaming but at least with the light on I know where I am immediately. On Saturday night my nocturnal screaming woke up Helen; Jay has learned to sleep through it. Fortunately I don't have the nightmares every night any more. I'm having them just now because of my anxiety about moving.   I've been giving advice to a couple of teenagers who having their first serious bouts of depression. They thought they were the only ones to have this maelstrom of emotion, and that there was no way through to the other side. I've now been called an inspiration, showing them ways to cope and survive, but we are all still works in progress - they just haven't caught up with me yet.

      Today the stair cat caught a fledging bird. I think it was probably a robin, because there was an adult robin flying around the garden in a very loud panic. It was the adult's distress that alerted me to the fact that something unusual was going on. The cat was just looking at the baby. She picked up in her mouth, moved a few feet across the garden, and dropped it again, waiting for it  do  something. I took the baby away from her. I didn't know where to put it so it would be safe for a few moments. There wasn't any blood, and I wasn't sure how badly injured it was. I thought it might die from fright when I picked it up, but it actually seemed to calm down a little. Less panting, relaxed a little, but still alive. I didn't want to leave it to suffer, but equally I didn't want to kill it if it wasn't too badly injured and might survive.  The feeling of relief from the baby when I rescued it from the cat was palpable. The adult had quietened down, and stayed close, watching what I was doing. The adult's distress was so strong I could almost see it as a physical thing. I hate to see anything suffer.   I stretched up as far as I could to lay the baby on the roof of the coalhouses, then I ran up to get Jakob and Helen. He looked at the bird and said there was blood, a broken leg and a broken wing. Now I think about it he didn't actually say the baby was dead. The adult robin was gone, as was the cat. I hope it did die while I was upstairs, with its parent close by, and not with the cat leaning over it. I don't think the cat knew how to give the killing strike; I don't think she knew what to do with the baby at all. I grew with five hunting cats, and I know how they play with caught birds. The stair cat wasn't doing any of the games.   I do hope it was dead then. I would have killed the little thing rather than let it linger on in pain.     I wonder if anyone would do the same for me?

        Part Seven    So, a week to go, and I will be living alone for the first time in my life. Frankly, though, there have been many times this year when I might as well have been living alone for all the interaction I had with Jay. In fact, if it weren't for more washing up than I'd need just for me, I would have said that yes, I do live by myself. The actual moving process frightens me but I am looking forward to the end result.   It will help me get better faster, I think. I will be able to arrange everything just as I want, without always having to compromise. Compromise with Jay usually means we do just as he wants, with perhaps a little sweetener for me so I don't feel completely hard done by. David will only be here for a few days after I move, as he has his last exam a week on Friday and will be returning to Belfast shortly thereafter. At least this year he gets some time to himself before starting work. He deserves a week of total slacking.  I've been thinking about the ideas of 'like' and 'dislike'. I'm generally neutral about most people until it's established that I do enjoy their company. There are some people I don't like, which means that I don't particularly enjoy their company but they haven't done anything to piss me off seriously. Dislike only happens when someone has deliberately acted in a way which causes me emotional disturbance. This needn't even be something which is directed at me. Hurting, angering or upsetting someone I like will do the trick. It gets a bit more complicated and simpler when it comes to actions directed at me. Hurting me or upsetting makes me angry. The amount of anger is directly related to the amount of hurt. Until that hurt is healed, I will stay angry about the person and incident which wounded me. As the hurt lessens, so does my ire.   However, even a healing wound can be ripped open again, and then the full fury flows out again, like a pyroclastic surge.
