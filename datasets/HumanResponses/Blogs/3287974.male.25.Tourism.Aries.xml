      I missed 2 days of posting.. I'm not lazy..  My PC was really lagging last few days, after installing Norton Internet Security. If you guys think that a good program.. Don't you ever think about to install it.!! It makes your PC lag like hell. So I uninstall it, then all the problem start. I can't log in my MSN Messenger, my connection slows down and my PC still lag, then last night at 12am I started to reformat my hard disk and reinstall win xp. For past 2 days, there so much things going on. My gym mates missed me, coz for past few days I prefer to come in morning, so we didnt meet, the reason, I having class in da afternoon and there something to do in the evening. Last thursday, I went to watch movie with Karen L, "Day After Tomorrow" or in translation "Lusa".. I was a good movie. Arghh!! My mum called again asking me about working.. I hate that!! It ticked me!! She keep asking me about it.. It's not like I didnt look for jobs, I'm waiting for call, damn this people, when they gonna start calling me..  SO MUM PLEASE STOP NAGGING ME!! DONT MAKE ME NOT PICK UP UR CALL!! I think she's a bit stress out coz my brother getting marry next week, and he's gonna start studying, he's been out of job for 3 months now, and she didnt nag him, I just finished my study for less than a month.. and she nags me like I'm jobless for 2 years.. Hey, when my brother just finish his, he was jobless for 3 months, working for almost a year, then quit,when back johor, jobless more than 6 months, but she didnt nag.. but why to me!! I'm going back BP today, i'm not sure how's my feeling.. I dont have a joy feeling of going back at all. Maybe if I got a job, and having a life here, I think I'm not gonna going back home at all. My feeling toward my mum was like love and hate relationship, I'm not close with her, actually to most of my family, so i think i better of alone..

      Wow.. I think this is gonna be the luckiest week in my life. Having to win 2 separate contest in just two days.  Yesterday I received a sms tells me that I won 2 tickets to catch the world premier of "Day After Tomorrow" and then today, I receives a Pos Ekspress that contains 2 passes of the Starlight Cinema that gonna be held next month, worth RM60. I feel so lucky!! Then, when I chat with Karen C afterwards, she also won 6 passes for the same occasion. Now it's gonna be 10 of us going!! Imagine that!! We gonna have a blast that night.. Just hoping that we gonna go on the same day... This thing sure bring me a big smile today, coz ever since wakes-up, I wasnt feeling so cheerful (lacks of endorphine). Having to win these two tickets, sure brighten up my day, I didnt even go to gym today!! Hahahaha...  Of had a quick chat with Hung Seah.. my exschoolmate from BP. We talk about working, since I'm jobless and well he's too.. and our exschoolmate getting marry this Saturday!! Hahaha one by one getting married, what about me?? Not even a girlfriend yet!! Argh!! Dont wanna think about it!! If the fate says I will, I will if didn't I cant blame it!! Let me tell you a secret... Nah!! Don't want la..  Ohh.. Someone missed me in the gym... tsk! tsk! Chings called me at around 9pm. Of course we talk rubbish for 40 mins. Hahaha sure hell of fun..!! It's been awhile I didn't talked crap stuffs!!  Okay guys.. I'm out now..  P/s : Hung Seah..

      Uargh!! I feel so tired... even I just woke up. Haha I didn't go to gym yesterday.. Hanging out with Lulu and then with Ken later at night. We watch movie last night. First in morning Lulu and me watched 'Secret Window'. Kindda good movie. Johnny Depp really good on bringing this kind of character. Then we meet up with Denise.. and she was alone. Something wrong with her and the boyfriend. We had late lunch later afterwards. Later, after that, I feel like eating ice-cream, so we were planning to go to lecka-lecka (italian gelato - it's a heaven!) but somehow Lulu saw this vacancy notice at this Japanese restaurant. End up he applied for job there. Hmm.. I wanted a job so bad these days. I can't apply there coz it's a non halal restaurant. For past few days, Lulu has been talking about jobs, currently he's working at this western restaurant that gonna open soon, but he doesn't like some people there, even the owner is really kind to him. He got another job offer in One Utama, but the payment is RM 300 less. So he couldn't choose between the two. I just tell him to pick where he has the strongest feeling towards to. Later last night, Ken asked me to go out. So I agreed. So I draged along Lulu, we went watch 'Van Helsing'. It's kindda good, but too much animation that's looks like a cartoon. But I enjoyed it. Esp drooling over Kate. WOW!! Then that night, out of nowhere, we end up in Sri Hartamas for yum cha. Just for a quickie.. Headed back to my place. I didn't know how on earth I get close with Ken, we were in same college but hardly talk untill before we went for industrial training. A big group of us went to clubbing. Then we start talking. Coz most of us were drunk except me and him, there something else happened to one of our friend. Only me and him were there. So it kindda make us close because of that experience. Hmm.. I was wondering bout it's so easy for me to get close with someone, but I have to set a limit between that. I don't want same thing happend again like last time between me and J (not Justin). So last night before sleeping I was thinking bout this. Then I started to think that something could be prevented if I were mature enough last time. I kindda miss that moments. It maybe sound so gayish.. but it just a mutual feeling between buddies. Now, it's all over.. I still look at the bright sight. I become much better as a friend and overall as person. I just hoping for all the good thing will happen to him. GOOD LUCK ON EVERYTHING U DO, MAN!! Oh.. Yesterday I won 2 tickets to watch 'Day After Tomorrow' premier in KLCC this thursday. This would be the first ever I won something for a contest. I dont know whom shall I bring. I need to collect the ticket today.. But I have a class today.. After class I had to go to gym.. It feel so bad everytime I skipped...

      I got back from gym around 9.30pm. I was trying to wait for Parry for her to finish her working so we can go back together. But Lulu called me. He needs the house key, he been staying with me for few days already. He can't stay in his house coz it's not ready yet. But nevermind bout it. Today at the gym, I meet Chings.. I knew her from KDU, she's now unemployed just like me. She's a mass comm grads. Waiting to further her study, she join gym since a week ago. No wonder she missed called me today. I knew that she must be in the gym. I had few workout with her. Until I meet Kak Nita (whom I meet her last 2 weeks). Wah!! She so cool for a mother of 16 years old and 3 years old daughter. She can dance.. Better than me. Kak Nita, Sha aka Bobby, Chings and me went to Hi-Lo class, but Chings quit half way. Coz this class is all about dancing. So guess who the spotlight... Kak Nita la... Hehehe Oh before the class, I bumped to Sha, and she was asking who is Chings. Then she made a remarks bout the girls i been mixed around in da gym. Yeah I kindda notice that, I mix alot with the female  friend in da gym than the guys. Maybe when you workout the testeron level is high. but somehow, all the females there are nice, and they seems to talk to me, even we just meet. Sha said that I'm a playboy... I wish.. It just me.. I kindda easy to mix with the female counterpart. But nevermind.. I think some of the guys knows that, they keep looking at me, like envying me.. hahaha.. perasan.. After the class, as usual the drink bar was filled-up with the thirsty hippo.. hahah thirsty gym junkies.. the there was this guy sitting alone, so i joined him. His name is Kenny. Then we talk.. actually I'm the one who broke the ice ( I notice I become more friendly since joining gym, talk to stranger - endophine effects), than we chat. Wow! This is the first male guy that I know from gym, since back from penang..Then later, his friend join us. Her name is Janice. Another female.. They were asking me, since that I told them I come there almost everyday, what I'm doing rite now.. So I told them I was a Chef student looking for job. That's makes them really excited. Yeah! Most of the people get excited when I told them I'm a soon-to-be-a chef. How great is it? How easy for you to make new friend if you open up. Then later on, after I showered, I sat at this empty table, class finishing.. those thristy junkie all rushing to get drinks. But none of them wanting to ask me to sit down joining me.. Like I did to Kenny.. Hmm.. I think those people arent as open as me.. Or maybe I'm too brave or over confidence to make friends.. I dont know.. Or maybe I have this image of dont messed up with me kindda thing.. coz of my eyebrow piercing.. maybe.. who knows... This morning, Sabrina told me that everyone in Penang asking about me.. She ask me to join her back in Penang.. It's a good idea.. but I'm going back to Johor this weekend. Moreover, I dont have money... Hmm.. It seems that those people appreciate me as a friend more that some KDU friends.. I chatted with Justin last night.. telling him about how I felt in penang.. how they had treated me.. But I dont mind if he decide that I'm not his friend, coz I dont think he is.. I started to reject most of them because from what had happened in Penang.. I started feeling why I did this think, and worry it too much.. Just let it go.. I dont want to hate anyone.. Hating people just makes you tired to think about it. I didnt hate them.. I just ignore them. Just now I chatted with Ai Vee. She's a HR staff in Golden Sands. A nice girl. To tell the truth, I had a crush on her, but I didnt go. Coz it would make so difficult to deal with everything that might happened. Like I'm coming back to KL and she's a chinese and I'm Malay.. So I just decided to let the feeling go. Now we just friend. It seems much better. Easy to talk to her, and easy to kutuk her without the hard feeling.. Ok la.. I think that's it.. Need to go to sleep.. wakes up early, and do my daily regimen of becoming slavery of those dumb bell and stationary bicycle. Good Nite..

      Hi! This is my first blogging. I don't why I have to do this blogging, maybe I wanted to express what's going on in my mind to everyone who might wanted to know. So this is it.. Let's start..   Hmm.. Monday.. again.. Sometimes I like Monday, coz it the first day of the week.. I can start all the stuffs that I postponed last week.. Which I have a lot to do..  I need to get a job.. My mom start calling and asking me about it. She thought that I didn’t even looking for a job. I did! It just that I've been picky. Now, not anymore.. I've been standing still for too long.. I'm getting restless without anything to do, besides going to the gym. Last Friday I went to Starbuck for barista.. I hope I got it.   Today my day start a bit blur.. Having to wake up early coz I have to meet Sabrina in the gym, I got to know her when I was in Penang.. Her hometown is in Taman Megah in PJ. She called me last Friday. So we had one class together, Body Pump. That was her first time. I was surprised. And tomorrow we meet up again. Meeting her makes me missed penang so much!! I missed Shida, Kimmy, Fuzah and some of the trainees there and all the gym junkies there. Shakira, Elaine, Wenisa, Judy, Mrs. Lim, Shima, Ohm, Datin Noor, Francis, "Double Sided Guy" and list could go on... Although having to know these people for 2 months, but I feel good hanging out with them. Maybe I was desperately lonely, I was being ousted by my-so-called friends there. That was another story..   Last Saturday, I meet up with Karen.. She still like the last time we meet up, didn’t change much but look prettier. It's nice to see her.. Kind of missed her... When I arrived, she was reading the Four Agreements book, I have the same book, I bought it last year, when I'm facing a big problem with my used-to-be my closest buddy in KDU. But now, ever since that, I seldom read it. I don’t know why. I’ve been busy lately with my study and gym thing. I’m becoming a gym junkie.. It makes me feel good. Inside and outside. Gym totally change my life. Meeting up new friends, sweat out.. learning yoga.. and much much more.   I think that’s it for now.. Maybe later, tonight. Gonna eat something..

       Well 3rd day passed... still a juice guy   Any improvement over my feeling towards the staffs... Nope... Getting worst.. I hate most of them, is it me or what??!! NO!! Even few of us who are the part-timers think the same… Even one of the permanent junior staff telling me his feeling and he want to change place as soon as possible…  It’s not just me… Maybe it just my 3rd day. Give a little bit more time to bend in. One think I noticed that these people are claptrap, they thought they are so so so good, but they aren’t. The sous chef even had to teach them how to handle knife. Their logical senses are nonexistent. Hahaha…  They still give the cold treatment towards the trainees… They feel browbeaten towards us… Coz we might taking over their jobs… Even more towards me coz I have a diploma and much better sense of logical thoughts than them. They feel intimidated by me, coz I’m better then them. A lot better…!!   I think Hilton staffs are the most stuck-up ever… I to tested them, by smiling at them if I ever passed them, any responded, nope… Oh wait, only few people… Kitchen staffs? A few, only the juniors. The seniors, ohh they thought they are so good. Even I had on incident with this pak cik who are better be gone that staying there… When I was walking to other kitchen, we walk at the same lane, and he just keep walking, we almost bumped each other, I wasn’t looking coz I was lost and looking for a way… Ohh!! And by the way, they thought I had mastered the hotel layouts and the place to get stuffs. I even got scolded by the asshole stupid bigheaded chef of not knowing that the deep fried tofus are prepared in cold kitchen. How should I know… In Penang, deep fried tofus are from main kitchen. And is it a wrong things to ask if I didn’t know?? Pig..!! Don't assumed that I know everything works here!!!  I smsed my dad after working. About my feeling... Rite now, I really need to go to US so much… I hope I got my visas approved… I already set my mind about it, no question asked.  If I didn’t get it, I think I need to change place… Much better place… I prefer Shangri La KL. I worked there last year, and the staffs there are much friendlier…  I didn’t go to gym again, I feel so fat now… Anger and stressed. Tomorrow need to work two shifts coz had to do outside function.

      2nd day... I became a juice man for breakfast buffet. Well I need to learn something, including becoming the lowest rank staff here. The staffs here are a bit uptight here, not like Penang staffs in Golden Sands, they are more friendly... Here the buffet isn't as great as in Golden Sands, but they need twice as worker as in GS. Talking about efficiency... It's nothing compare with GS. The staffs also nothing compare in GS. I'm not being bias coz of the people here, but I feel they need to cool down not so being uptight... Let loose a thing... Start treat people who are new like me better... Understand that I didn't know the kitchen very well and please don't be such a scumbag!! I didn't go to gym today, although Chings asked me... I didn't bring my stuff to work coz I didn't have my locker yet!! I feel stressed...

      Hilton PJ is coolest hotel i ever work!! They have this staffs' lounge that complete with 55 inches projection tv, 2 billiards tables, a messager chair, 3 Dell PCs, with a laser printer and very cosy setty. WOW!! I was so surprised!! The food is good, no complaint... Though I don't really ngam with the staffs, but it was my first day. But I feel so good, to be back in the kitchen.  Oh.. I think I might give someone feel unsecure bout their job, coz I accidently show-off, it all because of tuna salad. He doesn't know what they handling, and I spurred out the name of the fish. But I don't care less bout it. Coz I'm started thinking that, this gonna be my temp job until going to US. Hope so...  I had to do OT, till 8pm. Coz one of the staff was MC. Tomorrow gonna start at 7am. And Parry, Karen L, Ricky and me when yum cha after my workout... Yummy cakes (yes its cakes...). They the only friends that I have from the college, including some other guys, less then 5 people...  Ok.. hav to rest... Need my beauty sleep...

      It's my last post for today... If I ever post this thing everyday... lol. Ok.. I got part time job in Hilton, at least I'm working, I didn't care about how much I get, it just gonna be for my experience sake and to fill up my day with something good. But I'm not sure if I could spend or at least going to the gym, I'm gonna be a miserable freek then.. But the Hilton is near to Axis, it should be no problem. Tomorrow gonna meet my parents at Bukit Jalil.. I have to travel that far... But nevermind... I wish I have a car.. easy for me to travel and to go 'enjoying' myself with friends... Eric called me again, asking about how to write a resume... Hmm... See.. If they need help, sure call me... I called Lulu aka Terrence, he's not happy with his work rite now, hmm.. he got pay a lot compare with me, but he's not happy, coz the owner of the restaurant only asking him to prepare the drinks... It's not fair!! He's a good chef, only he's a bit slow, but he's good. He asked me for advice... Coz he got another offer in One Utama, in Road House steak restaurant, but the payment not as good, but he will learn a lot preparing food. I just tell him, to look for the best possible thing that might happened, if he decided to switch job. But if he want to learn more, without thinking how much he got, he should go to the steak house. At least he will be treated well... Even more, the restaurant that he currently working the supervisor is our ex-class mates that I annoyed sooo sooo much... If I were him, I switch my job long ago... Oh.. Gym today was good... Meet with the same gang... GYM JUNKIES.. And I got to know nice leng luis... BJ, and two manicure girls (forgot their names). BJ is a nice girl... Quite attractive.. Hmm.. wondering something here... ;) I'm chatting with one of the gym junkie rite now, Rebecca... I'm thinking about the US job, it will be my good experience, but have to leave this people, hmm.. quite sad... I'm gonna missed them, as what happened to the Penang gang... Good Night!!

      Yup, another interview tomorrow, and still, I'm awake... This time in Hilton PJ. Hmm... anything to say... nothing.. Today? Hmm.. Nothing special except I'm a bit hyper this morning in the gym. Acting like crazy person with Parry. I'm gonna miss her if I ever gonna leave to US. Ohh.. Eric called me twice... Asking me about this AIPT program. Hmm... This guy, after we finished training, he didn't even say hi to me, now, looking for me... He used to be my friend during my study in KDU. Now, I don't think so... It all happened because between me and Josh. Sorry to say, these people are chauvinistic. During the study, I'm not proud and I should not mentioned this, but it seems to be unfair... I HELPED THEM A LOT FOR ALL THE PROJECTS AND RECOGNITION!!! After all habis, they not even say thanks... Stupid chauvinistic pigs...!!! My parents allowed me to go to US. Now the problem is the US embassy will ever let me go. Coz all the stupid Islamic extremist. Ok that's it.. Will write about the interview tomorrow...

      Ever since I setting up my website, I think I'm in love with designing again... I've been reading the stuff that I've been ignoring for years, trying to remember the coding, as well as catching up the technology and everything. That's what I'm doing when I'm bored. Even yesterday, I even look up for book about CSS in MPH, luckily the books are too damn expensive. If not, then I'll buy it. How the passion came back? Well it's actually from blogging. Then, I was looking for idea to design this site. I look up the codes, then trying to redesign the site. Then, I bought a domain, thinking of setting up my site, I learnt how to code again. Then all the sudden, I felt in love again... Well, I'll keep this as a hobby only. Now, I have three passion in live, 1st cooking, 2nd fitness and 3rd website. Ohh, I want to this cooking book that cost about RM 400++.. Damn!!  Cooking books are so so overpriced in M'sia!!  I'm gonna get it in Amazon.com instead.  Ohh, finally I managed to stroll my bike to back my house, at 6 am this morning, after I been left the bike in-front of 7 Eleven for 3 days,  n sadly nobody want to steal it... I was hopping so, coz later I can get a new bike... How bad am I? I got an email about the US thingy... And some of us is going, someone that I don't like... Shit!! But then I just disregard bout it.. never mind about that! I have to talk to my dad bout this US thingy since I need to pay about RM 5000 for it. ... But I'm not sure when should I leave... If I'm leaving, I have to cancel my gym membership and my webbit. Damn!! But I can't wait to go...  Oh!!  This Friday I'm going for another interview in PJ Hilton . It's much nearer to my house and Fitness First.. Just opposite.. I called Shangri-La's but they still haven't confirm me the jobs... Oh well, now I'm prefer more to Hilton. U know, each hotel that I wanted to work, always nearby Fitness First. Shangri-La is nearby the SPK outlet, Hilton nearby Axis. Hmm... Last Monday, I meet up with someone familiar from Penang, she was the FF instructor in Penang. She was so surprised to see me here, in KL I went for her RPM class which I missed it so much. We had a long chat, I had overwhelming feeling... But she not gonna teach in Axis, but if I got any chances definitely going to SPK to visit her. Oh by the way, if any of you guys wanna join  Fitness First in Axis, the joining fees in ONLY RM 1 , you save RM 98 when I paid when joining. The total would be RM 396 instead of RM 494. Only until end of this month... Only in Axis other outlet, I'm not sure.

      I'm in stress right now... After so long never been in stress. Today early morning I went to gym. I was feeling good, coz today I'm having a gym challange with my partner, Chings. I was really motivated to take part, coz the winning team will get IBM notebook, X40. But she didn't turn up... I thought she's coming coz last night she sms me, letting me know bout it... At the end, she didn't. But I was ok.. Later on, my mum called... As usual, she asking me about what am I doing, I told her that I'm at the gym, then she start asking me if I got any job yet, I told her, not yet, since I didn't get any comfirmation from all the interview that I went for... then she said things that annoyed me. She telling me that, I've been jalan-jalan in KL, spending money. I just keep quiet.. coz I was in public place... But the truth that, I didn't even go KL for weeks now, the last time I had been out, with friends for the sake of entertaiment was 2 days ago, after weeks I didn't watch movies, last movie I catch was free. I hardly go out, even doing dieting, eating only twice a day. Mostly sandwiches. She asked me to go back Johor, which was stupid... What I'm gonna do there?? I'm still looking for job, it's not like I just playing around here... Then later on, my bike rosak, half way from my house... under the scorching sun and tired body, I had to push my bike. But then I get fed-up, I left it in-front of 7 Eleven. Damn!! Why must it all happened now, if I repaired the bike will coz me money, and if I asked my parent for it, surely my great mother will says something that so annoyingly shit to make me upset again... No wonder my elder brother prefer to work in KL to stay away from her, and soon, it will be me... I'm just wait for the moment to go aboard and most probably will never come back!!! I'm too tired with her... Never stop nagging... Called me ungreatfull son, but I had enough!!! Right now, what I'm thinking is how on earth I'm gonna repair my bike....

      I have a digital camera, or at least  had . I send it to repair in April, till today I haven't heard any news from it. I bought the Kyocera SL300R solely because of the looks. It's does has nice look and great feature, but it's spoilt after 2 months of using it. I missed it very much... If only I can trade-in, I will go for Nikon or Kodak, for better quality and features. I went to the shop in Batu Pahat, to check if the camera was ok, but then the guy said that he hasn't heard any news... If something came up, he will call me. :(  If only I have a digital camera right now, I will post everyday photo for my daily photoblog... It's looks cool... Coz it catching up really fast now.. Check out the community at http://www.photoblogs.org. And mysite is almost up.. Iskh!

      I went out morning to catch Shrek 2 with Chings. I seldom see her these days. I meet her yesterday at the gym. So we made a plan to watch Shrek 2 together and she bring along a friend. I can't remember his name.?? Hmm.. I'm bad at remembering names. I really enjoyed the movie!! It's so damn funny.. I started thinking about what behind the story in the Shrek. It all about how we look like..  Since I joining gym, seeing these people working hard pumping iron and running on treadmill making me thinking that, everyone have the same mind to get better body, because that some of us thinking that we being judge by the way we look like. Everyone want to be 'body beautiful' - six packs abs, round glutes, bulging pecks and strong arms - including me. Does it make me more confidence.. Yes!! Nowadays, when I'm back in Johor, meeting my aunts and uncles, for sure they gave me compliments and few comments. I can say I'm proud with myself.. On how I look. But then again, I really can't satisfied some people saying that I look too thin. They wanting me to put more weight!! Hahaha.. When I was overweight, they make fun of me, now they say something else..  Whatever!!   But since becoming gym-junkie for about 4 months, I started to enjoy doing what used to be my daily regiments of self-abused, not because of wanting to get those 'body beautiful', just because to have fun with the friends that have same interest with me and meeting up with new friend. I can say that I getting know more people in gym, then during my study in college or training in hotel. Coz these people feel good about themselves and what they are doing, that's why they so open and friendly, but sometimes they are quite shy, I'll have to make the first move ( till today, I hardly know any male friend form the gym!! )!! But not all are friendly and willing to chat with you coz some are supercilious kind of people.  And you might facing something funny that can make you laugh!! Like yesterday, doing the yoga class, I missed interpreted what the instructor says, so I end-up doing something else, a position that really funny, instead doing on your side, I did a bridge, the funny things that, when she told us to stand,  I was like huh?? Standing from bridge position?? Wow! This is advance!!  And by that moments, she was standing next to me, and she asked me, how do I ended-up like that!! And everyone start looking at me!! She was laughing and the rest follows... Then I joint them... Even until finished the class she keep smiling at me.. Hahaha.. I think she will remember me for this. It wasn't the first time happened. First thing was when I were in Penang, I felt on the floor from doing back arching position, my hand slipped from supporting my upperbody, then the thumb sound was so loud, then the instructor start laughing ending up everyone laughing. From that moment, she knows me..   Sometimes good things happened after the bad experiences..     Oh, by the way, I had my first cramp on my leg today during the RPM class.. Couldn't finish the whole class.. I keep telling people who never done RPM, to try for it, and if they don't have the persistent to finish the class, pretending that you have a leg cramp. Hahaha, now who got it!! But I did 2 classes before that!! So I was okay with it.   P/s: I would like to thank to Karen Chan and Hung Seah for keeping reading on my blog and gives me some encouragements.  Thanks guys!!

      The only comic that I read everyday is Calvin and Hobbes. It's not just a comic strip, it's a vocabulary-enriching-comic-strip. On several days, I stucked with the words that Calvin says. Imagine such a small boys using those big words in everyday conversation, he should be genius boy. I think Calvin and Hobbes should make into big screen such as Garfield. I'll definitely gonna watch it!! I wish that my childhood was like Calvin, having a imaginary friend who always there for you and always listen all the crappy things that comes from my mouth. My childhood wasn't that good, the friend that I hangout during those days are nowhere. And I barely remember the happies moment in my childhood. The things that I still remember was being beaten up by my parents, being scolded and other bad stuffs that happened. That's is why I'm very emotional person. I just don't want to be hurt and getting hurt. That's when something that so hurting occurred to me, I feel like killing myself. It's true. I seems didn't care about my action would affected the people around me. I wasn't as social able when I grew up, because of the lack of self-confidence, being overweight and getting teased by my relatives make it worst. Only for past few years, I tried to change from unnoticed to be noticed by people around. But now, I'm trying to gain what was lost during the down time.

      Am I still depress about the past? Coz my choices of songs that I played frequently were all sappy songs about trying to forget something or someone... I didn't noticed it until I checked just now. The most played were "My Immortal" by Evanescene and "Here Without You" by 3 Doors Down. I started to listen that two songs last year, during all the shit happen. And till today I keep listen to it. If you were asking if I had any other choices of songs? Damn a lot!! In my collection, I have 2690, and if I played it non-stop it should take 7 days 15 hours 37 mins and 15 secs. It shows that some part of me still grieving.. but each day bring me strength to face up and stand tall.. And a moment ago, I have completed my new extensive playlist containing top 40 songs that I have and using Party Shuffle in iTunes, I created 1 day long playlist non-repeated songs.. Wooo!! ciao!!

      Last night someone asked me to help him. To me I like to help people in need. But about this guy, well I have to think twice about it. Why? Coz the way he treated me last time and even now. My other friends that know him, say that he kindda friend with a cause.. If he needs help then he will be nice to you.. Yeah at first my thought wasn't like that.. Then last few months, I noticed that it's true.. Well, he need a place to stay, which I have a room for rent.. Am I obligated to help him? I dont noe.. but what Karen C said to me, makes me think about it. What Karen C told me was right. Maybe I'm gonna let him stay in my house.. But it's gonna be different.. I'm not gonna treat him like before, maybe like a stranger..

      It's been almost 4 months I quit smoking. Feeling much better. I can breath easily during intense workout. But today, I missed smoking, moreover I saw these people smoking at mamak after workout and I feel a bit stressed out. GET REAL MAN!! That's what I'm thinking.. How I wish I can smoke again.. But guess what, I can't.. My lungs can't take it anymore. I will get heavy breathing, coz my lungs now working in full condition, thanks to daily regiment of intense cardio. Tomorrow night going out with Preeta and Cherelyn to Sri Hartamas. Cherelyn invited me to go, it's her cousin's pub, so it should be free.. :)

      My interviewed yesterday was ok. I'm sure (90%) that I got the job. Now I'm worried bout the US thingy. I got to know only 2 students will be selected to go. I have no idea about my chances. For 2 nights I meet-up with Preeta. We talk about how we missed Penang and how's life nowdays after Penang. My life perception changed a lot after Penang. The experiences was good, overall. I've changed after Penang. Ohh.. How I missed Penang so much!! To me, Penang experiences give me a new breath on my life. I was really down after so much that happened before Penang. Everything is new to me, nowdays. I'm more comfortable with myself being alone. I have no problem eating alone, go out alone even watching movie alone. But the thought of missing someone still stuck in my head. I missed those people who cheered-up my life before. Those people who I love to be with. But where are they now? These days I don't know where and who they are. Karen C busy with her work. I meet-up with her after my first interview last Friday. She's look a bit stressed out. Tomorrow is a new day for a new week. I'm looking forward to give a productive week for myself in sense of my personal feeling, achivement and improvement in my quality of life.

      I had unexpected call from Eddy (his the guy that I know from Hilton) asking me to go out today. But I told him that I'm having exam later today. He will be working in mandarin Oriental this Monday. He told me that Chef Hans in Hilton was upset with us, but I don't care. Then later, Ken Lim and me went out for lunch. It was fine. Free meal at Nando's, One Utama.     I did my exam terribly, hoping that I pass.  And then, Julie start to call me. I saw here before but I just ignored her, but then later she called me. So she start asking me what I've been doing and so forth. I hadn't talk to her since I'm still in Penang, and even after gotten back, we meet at college but we didn't talk, because I still pissed at her because she lied to me, which I take it very personally. I'm still pissed. So I didn't talk much to her, and she knows it.    David called at 6pm, when I was taking my nap. We haven't see or contact for awhile.  And not long ago, Mazli smsed me, asking how am I doing... It just amaizing that I was in someone mind... I feel blessed...

      Meeting up with Aliyah was a pleasure. Supposed we gonna watch I, Robot at TGV in KLCC, but the show postponed to 9pm (what a ripped off). We didn't watch coz it's gonna be late by the time the movie finish. But we had a good talk to catch all the new stories... Yeah, can call it gossip. It's been awhile... Although she changed a bit (in appearances), other than that she still the same Aliyah that I used to know...   I left my medical check-up letter and my bank letter from Shang in her handbag... Man!!      I had late-night meet-up with Chings, Susan and Su Lin at SS2 Murni. And what a surprise that I sat next to Lu Pei, Lya and Kristie without even noticed until I heard Lya voice. Hahaha... I was sitting there for about 10 mins. Glad to meet up with them...   Our session this time, still the loudest!!! Of course we talk nonsense but still funny... It's a careless conversation, no hard feelings and guilty free... Initially we wanted to go clubbing, but it's kindda too late. Nevermind, most probably tomorrow night.     SHIT, I have exam tomorrow, haven't read a thing...

      I'm not the selected one to give the speech on graduation's day. So as I promised, this is my speech...     When I decided to take this course – the Diploma in Professional Chef Training, there were many raised eyebrows because it is non-conforming for someone who was a science student. Taking a course that is not a norm and dealing with something like “cooking”, is not well perceived by people who regard doctors, lawyers and architects having better careers.    As for me, I perceive it differently. I used to be a computer science student who had to deal with binary codes, zeros and ones. These two numbers are the possibilities that we will never know. It all depends on how you arrange and execute it, which will bring the difference and results that you wanted. It may take some time to program it, but at the end, we may achieve the result according to our objectives. It’s almost the same with our journey in this life. There are a lot of possibilities and opportunities that we will never know. All we have to do is to explore them. Take the risks with all the guts and if we ever stumble some uncertainties, bear in mind that someone will be there if you need any help. This is how I feel for the past few years. All the impossible thoughts that I had faded away gradually. I have gained new knowledge and a new spirit that has brought me here where I am standing. To me impossible means nothing. Impossible is just a negative thought that holds back our dreams.    During my years in local university, all I knew was about going to the classes, doing all the projects and getting good grades. This just wasn’t me. I became tired and lost my affection towards it. I had lost, not only the direction but in my battle without not even knowing what is it all about. Then, I had to make drastic changes. Changing the path of my life – to do something that I am really fond of - so I decided to pursue my study to become a chef. Studying in KDU, I had achieved something that is not only academic achievement but personal rewarding experiences. It’s like a part of my dream has come true. I could see myself changing. I have gained confidence that I had lost during my studies in the local university. I learned to motivate myself here in KDU.     Motivation is the key of changing yourself to be better that you used to be. I motivated myself to be a competitor, competing with myself. It’s the only way for me to prove that in all I have done, I have tried my best. I motivate to see the changes in myself. I motivate to get good grades. After I had done with the motivation, I have to develop it as a habit. Because there’s a phrase saying that ‘Motivation is what you get started, habit is what keeps you going’. A’s is not something that I can get easily, but it’s something that I earned with the hard work I have put in. Getting good grades is not all of it. I still enjoy the everyday life here and have fun doing it with all my beloved friends. I live to the max everyday, because I know if I ever hold it back, tomorrow would not be the same as today. I will not get the same opportunity again.    After this graduation, we are going to be disconnected from the familiar surrounding – we will be venturing to another milieu that makes us feel that we are aliens. It will give us the greatest challenge. It will be totally different from the college life that we used to. We have to re-adjust to fit in. We have to apply what we have learned in KDU – be resourceful, be independent and create opportunities for ourselves. Believe me, it is a cruel, cruel world out there. Just be ready for the challenges. But it should give us a new spirit to believe in yourself and to be strong. Because someone who is strong mentally and emotionally, has a different attitude towards life and the people around him. Someone who is strong thinks positively even at the bleakest hours! Someone who is strong will not blame or complain, but will find a solution to problems instead of moan and groan.    Don’t get intimidated with future colleagues because if we show any weakness, they will take advantage over us. Show them that you have the capabilities of doing the same things and even much better; you just need time to be polished. Don’t despair if what you plan did not work out well, because failure does not mean to stop trying, it is just a reminder that we are human. We have limited capabilities and it is alright to fail, but it does not mean we should stop trying; in fact, it should awaken us to be more patient and to be more resilient. This is a process of learning. Many times we think that we know so much just because we have a paper or a position to justify how much we know. But in actual fact, the learning process never stops. Even at the lowest point, we’ll never stop learning.    Today, we have managed to set our foot to be in this ceremony, but the journey has just begun - the journey of pursing our dreams which we have conceived in our mind. Show the world what we are made of, because nobody in this world can hold us from reaching our dreams.     KDU has provided us with the platform, and I know that all of us can make the difference to realise our dreams.    Before I end this speech, I would like to say my gratitude towards the people who have guided me, helped me and be present around me; to the lecturers, thank you for your constant guide and support and let me be a part of the KDU family. To my friends, thanks for every sweet moment that we had shared together and last but most importantly to my beloved parents and family, without their unconditional support and love, I don’t think I would even be standing here. Thank you.  By the way... This is my 50th post...

      I got back yesterday. Everything was ok in Johor. Just that my parents a bit freak out since my dad got attacked by buglar early this month. They become extra carefull, even thinking about installing motion detector alarm. Other than that, seems ok...   I had lunch at Cafe 87 (it owned by School of Hotel n Tourism, runs by chef students), it's been a year since I was the chairman. I missed it so much. Not the cafe but memories. When I still close with them. I missed the chaotic and runing around. Dealling with those picky customers. Hahaha... It was a great time!!    These few days, gonna be my last days before I start my new job next week. Can't hardly wait. I hope it's gonna be different from my previous job. Ohh, by the way, I didn't go for job interview in Le Meridien. Coz I just to stay in on place at the moment, and Chef Billy keep asking me, it sound that he really needs staffs.    Alright then, later... I'm enjoying my moment with my fav ice-cream Baskin Robbins... Yum...

      Definitely the noisiest table ever!! &nbsp;I had yum cha session with Chings, Susan, Su Lin and Ariel. Susan and Su Lin are Chingss’ friends that I went out last night. So basically we talk about what happened on that night to Ariel. It was hilarious!!! All of us are the noisiest ever!! We couldn’t stop laughing. Man!! It’s been a while for not having laughing so much until my jaws hurt!   These 2 friends are hilarious combine with Chings, they can shake the whole room with their laughter. Tak kering gusi… Damn funny…   Before that, Parry, Chings and me were in One Utama. Casual meeting up… Again… From what I can see, Chings and Parry getting close. It’s good, since from what I know, Parry seldom hang-out with female friends so this is kindda good. Only left me a bit awkward situation when these girls talking and shopping for make-ups.. &nbsp;Later, Susan joined us for dinner. It was funny too since this Susan is very out&nbsp; going, she went and ask this guy phone no for Chings… Hahaha…   This was the funniest and zaniest night since I got back from Penang… I had so much laugh for one night!!!   By the way... I'm off for few days... I'm going back Johor before starting new job.

        There are many discussions between me and friends about job. I can't do much about it since I facing the same problem, but I'm happy with my job, I'm waiting for my new job. Her problem lies on money and time. She gets less money that what she worked out. Her working hours from 6am to 10pm. She didn't even have time to spend for herself. Her pays barely touch RM1000. She wanted to teach classes not to do trainer.   My problem is money. I’m totally broke. I took the risk to resign without being paid. Now I'm facing the consequences. I can't get money from my parents. Now I’m living with brother make it worst. I can't use the kitchen, at least before they moved in; I still can keep my bread, tuna or milk in the fridge. Now, I can't. Coz every time I wanted to use the kitchen, I have to knock the door, coz his wife has to 'hide' inside the room coz I think she's naked!! No, coz she didn't wear tudung when she's cooking. Now, I have to pay electrical bill, but I hardly spend my time in the house, only for me to sleep. Most of the time I spend myself in gym or out. I have to pay RM30. I didn't use the fridge. Hardly use the washing machine. What the fuck!! I know this thing might happened coz even thought we are siblings but I don't have the feeling of being brother to him.   Last night I went out with Chings and her friends. We went to Thai Club, we get free entrance coz one of her friend know the one of the owner of the club. It will be the last time I've been there. Its sucks!! The DJ sucks!! If I have a gun, I definitely shot him!!

      I went for the interview... I start my new job this 2nd August. My speech went ok. I'm not sure if I get selected.     I'm one of the award recipient for this convo. That's the reason that I get selected to give the speech. I won IMI Award, with Karen and Ricky. Parry won the Book Award and Derek won the JA Henckel Award. IMI Award based on overall academic and co-curriculum achievements. Parry was so surprise about this. Me too...    Parry, Rick and me went to 'disturb' Karen during her lesson, for her Birthday Announcement. We all sing the Birthday song to 'Miss Karen'. It was good moments for her... I had fun doing that... It's been a while for not doing something crazy like that. Hahaha    Parry, Rick and me had late supper together instead going clubbing. I'm not sure how many time we can do this... Since Rick going away... Rick sure kena kutuk from Parry... Funny... Getting sleepy now... I'm sure I forget to write something here... Nevermind, later...     Chiow...

      I somewhat happy today... woke-up early, feel like going to gym, but then I’m going later at evening. No need to work so hard... I did RPM today!!! I haven't done in almost a month. People notice me that I lose weight, even Mr Thomas said I lose weight a lot. But until today, I don't know how to respond the comments. Should I said thanks... or 'yes I lose a bit'. But most of the times I said thanks even I’m not sure it’s a compliment or concerning remarks.  I meet up with Kai in college today. But the meeting somewhat quick one since I have to rush to gym. Practically what we talked about was all about working. During Parry and me on our way back, she ask my opinion about her work. Well I think she should considering another option. We have to make the opportunities available for us; we can't just wait for it to come. That's why I quit Hilton and move to Shangri-La. I make my own opportunities. It's in my speech.

      My speech went well today. Just need to be shorten and correcting all the mistakes.  I will not post my speech in this blog, only after the graduation. But if I'm not selected, I will post it as soon as possible. But I'll pray that I get selected. Hehehe...  I had dinner with Karen Lim. Our discussion basically about her work and my situation that I'm having. Before Shangri-La called me, I have the thought of wanted to work in KDU. Now, when she told me that the guy in purchasing had left, there was a vacancy for the post. Now I were thinking about that post. I feel like working in KDU. Either as Lab Assistant or Purchasing. Either one of it is good. Fixed time, nearer from my house. The pay, same with the hotel. But I weren't sure bout it. I guess that I need to check it out from Mrs Tan bout this. Hmmm... But I already confirm with Shangri-La. Why I must change my mind so quick? Why can I just stay firm with my decision that I've made? Am I being too greedy or choosy?

       There's nothing major happened today in my life, beside the Shangri-la job is confirm. And I forgot to go to Hilton. Darn! Anything else... Nope...   I think I need to start writing names of person that I meet and know everyday as new friends. If only I have my digital camera back, I can snap their photo!! Let me see.. Today I get to know Kelvin and yesterday was Patricia. Here are some describtion about them and&nbsp;the new friends that I meet previous days...   Kelvin  is the guy who always standing in front during Hi-Lo class. His 30 years old. And he thought I was 30 years old too.. Am I look that old??   Patricia  is about 35+. She used to be in John Hancock Fitness First member. She like to join Hi-Lo too. I guess she's not marry or divorcee. I had a conversation with her yesterday about life, working and everything... Our conversation lasted about 2 hours...   Carl  is Parry's ex-schoolmates. Same age, I guess. Short but muscular. I think he is a nice fellow.   Brian  is Carl's friend. Didn't know much about him. Very quiet.  I think that's all...   My dad going to see me tomorrow, he's gonna give me this convo letter that I should reply by this Friday.  I can't believe it's been 2 years...  WOW!! Most importantly, I  change  during these 2 years. I had a very tough situation happened. I had lost a very good friend. Then eventually a group of friends.   I get close with the most wonderful friends,  Karen Lim, Parry(my extremely outgoing and motivated friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;my sweetheart  *wink ), Chings (craziest happy go lucky girl), Lulu (out-of-this-world outrageous), Hung Seah (very supportive and understanding) , Preeta (lost at times, outgoing) Ken Lim (hmm.. hard to describe him, a little&nbsp;bit naive), Tan Yu Kai (my statemate friend, one of the most closest friend in KDU, but now I'm not sure, we haven't spoken, must has been busy),  Sheau Wen  (my ex-housemates,  thanks for my birthday cake, really surprised me!! ), Josh Chua (used to be the closest buddy in KDU, we are not&nbsp;friend anymore), Julie (I didn't know why we stop talking to each other), Eric (same as Julie, but he did called me few times, only for business purposes) and Esther and Justin (I have been ignored by them when I was in Penang, are they still my friend?Hmm...).&nbsp;   I understand that my ex-schoolmates are  too busy  to call me, but managed to have a meeting-up behind my back. Azizan still owe me money and my handphone. Return back my phone or pay!! GOD DAMN IT!!!  &nbsp;   Karen Chan is one of the most special person in my life.  She's been like my sister that I never had.&nbsp;She's a very complex person. Her wits in life surprises me!!      I did excellent in my study .&nbsp;I managed to get 80 points for final average marks (about 3.80 CGPA). I only got 3 Bs. The rest are A's. Been top in the class for 5 semester straight!! Been selected as one of the valedictorians (for my school)&nbsp;for convo's day.  I lost 25+kgs. From 40 inches waist to 30 inches. 10 inches lost.  Gained few pound of muscle!! hehehe!! I had experienced the worst feeling in the world. Being depressed for 3 months. Being stupid for 3 months. I had the happiest moments. Being with my friends that I still have.      Stayed in Penang for 4 months, get to know wonderful people there, that I will never forget!!! Missed ya!! &nbsp;Joined Fitness First, and eventually get to know more friends..&nbsp;I get addicted to smoking, and eventually I gave-up the bad habit...    Seriously, the past 2 years really being the most challenging and the most memorable. The ups and downs of my life happened during the short 2 years.   I still haven't got a girlfriend yet!! URGH!!

      I know some of my friends are gay because they really open about it. Yesterday, Parry and me meet-up with her friends that actually gay. I have the sense he is gay after the boyfriend comes and sit with us. I meet up with him today, in the gym. He is a nice guy. Then on the way back just now, I told Parry that I meet with him and I told her, on how he had approached me. It was nothing to me, but if to someone else, he or she might feel uncomfortable. Then&nbsp;she told me that, these gay people are like that. Then somehow, I realised that they are more friendlier than a lesbian or straight people. I notice&nbsp;it happend anywhere, in the gym or in the hotel. That's the reason people who are not homophobia like to hang-out with them, they are much more open.&nbsp;Especially if you make dirty jokes to them. They can be really open.  &nbsp;  I'm not agaisnt the these people as long as they did not do anything to me, and vice versa. Then Parry told me that, some people are actually homophobic because they could not accept these people, she even got a friend who actually will beat-up the gay if he saying 'hello' to him. It's crazy, beat a person who saying hello..? I have&nbsp;few friends that are homophobic. They&nbsp;just didn't realised that maybe his or her&nbsp;close friend are gay&nbsp;until&nbsp;he or she tells&nbsp;about it.&nbsp;You will never know.  &nbsp;  Today, when I was in the gym, Kak Anita told me something that I should be bother about. It's about one of our friend, saying that she's jealous when I hang around with this other girl that this friend knows I had a crush on this other girl. Hmm.. I thought I was been clear saying that I just her friend, not more than that. Nevermind.   Today my trip to Shangri-La didn't give me anything good because the Chef who in-charge of calling me, are nowhere to be found including my application form (but I was told that it has been approved by the Exec Chef, only I had to do a second interview with the HR). And the Junior Sous Chef didn't know that the Chef taking me as a new commis. I got the sense that they are not so in good term. So I just go back. I'm going again this Thursday, but before that, I will call the Chef, to make sure.

      Sometimes it's hard to move on. We tend to return back and be at the same place even if we thought we&nbsp;had move on. I had a slight feeling of missing someone. I thought I&nbsp;forgot about it. But still I'm still standing still, it just did not much hurt as it used to.&nbsp;And my best friend Aliyah, smsed me. She went out with her ex today, that she still loves him. The only reason they broke up because he doesn't want to convert his belief.     urlLink     Parry &amp; Ricky&nbsp; urlLink        Parry, Chings and me had a blast together hang-out. Apparently, we went out to watch movie,  urlLink Spidey 2 , but&nbsp;all the tickets booked out. Later show is on 9pm. So we just had dinner together.&nbsp;But later,&nbsp;the girls, go for make-up shopping. Parry&nbsp;bought some lip glosses and a lipstick (Chings only tried out 20+ lip glosses from different brands,&nbsp;Stilla to Origins, Bodyshop to in2it,&nbsp;Maybeline to&nbsp;Loreal and I-can't-remember-brand-she-used on her lips), Chings meanwhile&nbsp;as usual bought a serial killer book. Me, I bought a chocolate bar (which I&nbsp;forgot to took it from Parry)&nbsp;and two sundaes. Yum yum... Before, we went to Dome Cafe for a free cheese cake and iced teas, compliments from my ex-housemate, Mizi. Hehehe... THANKS, Mate.&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  I had to finish my speech and typed it. I need to submit it to Ms Anne tomorrow and I'm going to  urlLink Shangri La  at 3pm. On Tuesday, I'm going to see HR in Hilton to ask if I can claim my salary for half month working there. If cannot, I have to  ikat perut, makan roti loo..  By the way, none of my family members know about my situation now. I'll let them know later...

      Today is my off day. I was thinking after waking up that, I might resign in Hilton starting this Monday if I ever get paid accordingly, since I would be busy with the speech thingy, if I ever got selected.   If I were to resign, at least I can go to Shangri La to confirm with Chef Billy about my job. I'm a bit worried about it, since he did not reply my sms 3 days ago. I wanted to call him for a meeting-up but I'm not sure about my schedule next week, so I need to wait till this Monday.   As for next week, I would be busy with my speech thingy. Coaching would be on Wednesday, Friday would be with the KDU Gradutation Committees. I'm hoping that I would get selected, it's an honour for me. But I wasn't sure about my speech if it's good enough to be chosen. I'm not good with writing speech. But at least I tried.   I called Karen C this morning, since haven't spoken with her for weeks. Her parents coming over. One thing I seems can't remember is her birthday. I wasn't sure when is her b'day. Maybe this month or november. I'm confuse with my other Karen friend. Karen L is on 23 July same with Alifa. Parry would be sometimes in September. The bad things is that, I didn't keep all the dates somewhere that I can refer to, except in my brain.   I have this ritual of going out with Parry once in a while and tomorrow we going for a movie. Maybe Ricky will tag along, or perhaps Chings. Last night, I went out with Chings and Lulu. I haven't meet-up with Lulu for weeks. He was on shopping spree. He smsed me to meet up. At least some of my KDU friends still remember me.   For the past few days in this week, at least few people called or smsed me.  Friends that called me  >Azam (my UPM buddy)  >Shakirah (Penang Fitness First gym friend)  >David (my ex-housemate)  >ET (KDU friend - we had dinner)  >Farah (KDU classmate)   Friends that smsed me  >Aliyah (UPM best friend)  >Chings (KDU and Fitness First&nbsp;friend)  >Parry (KDU buddy)  >Lulu (KDU classmate) Friends that I hangout with  >Chings  >Lulu  >ET  >Preeta  &nbsp;  Friend that I had a quick meet-up  > Karen L   It's been a busy week juggling with work and social activities, but I didn't go to gym for days. That's all...

        I didn't go to work today. I'm not feeling well. And I need a mc.     Which I'm gonna get it tomorrow.      As for my speech. I went well although it's not finish yet. I had a meeting with Ms Kitty, the H&amp;T dean to present my unfinished speech. She said it's not bad. What a relieve, but I need to finish it by Sunday. So that I can email to Ms Anne later. I'm a bit nervous with my speech since that I had few unpleasant moment with a exfriend of mine. Undoubtly, it will be awkward for me if I got selected. Coz my speech basically on my experiences in KDU.    Ohh! By the way, I will quiting my job in Hilton for Shangri-La next month. They offered me a better possition than in Hilton. I get paid better there. The only thing that worry me, is that how the people treating me and my reaction over it.    Oklah... Enuf bout it...

      Today everything that I done, all wrong. Everything I did, I got bad critisms. Which not helping. My sous chef is on leave. Leaving this guy in charged. I've been doing most of the stuffs for buffet today. Partnering with this guy which I totally disregard. And I've been doing his jobs from taking stuff from chiller to cleaning up the buffet. He disspear after his lunch. Which I had to clean up everything. I been running around, back and forth. This guy whom incharge, keep giving me new order before I even had to to my current job half-way. Which I had to done it very quick. I'm not sure until where should I do for each task. But usually, for anyone else, they just simply put the sauces on the pick-up table and someone in the kitchen wrap it up. But mine is totally different. I assumed that someone might help me, but not. He blame me. Now I know that, I had to finish everything by my own. I can't depend on from these people. And even I helped them, I never get thanks, but instead got the blame. How long should I stay on? I'm not sure. But what Karen C told me, I have to be strong. Be strong with myself not to give-up easily. Although I'm not happy with it, but I have to. To keep my mom happy coz I'm working even right now, they are not respect me and I have to put my ego to the ground level. And everything that happened to me each day, I keep myself thinking that I know one day I will be better that everyone in this Hilton kitchen. And when I do, I will come back to this kitchen and shows that who I am.

       I've been working like hell since got this low-self-respect level job. Working as kitchen helper even I got a diploma in professional Chef... I don't mind getting a low position, but working everyday as a Runner everyday as to refill the buffer from breakfast and lunch... really pissed me off. I really didn't enjoyed it. From 7am till 3pm have to walk as back and forth... really aching my legs. If u guys thought that I'm week.. you are wrong... I happened to be most motivated person among all my friends, I never say quit, I will never ever quit. But then again, this is with an exception. My colleagues are dead ass hole. Only few people that I hang around with. Urgh.. Now to think about it.. I wish I was working in KDU. I thinking that, my experiences during my industrial training are much better that working here. I learnt a lot during my training than working as kitchen helper. Oh by the way, if you like to eat in Hilton, better think twice, since I'm working here, there's not even once, hygiene manager to check the kitchen condition, or I think they don't have one. Not like Shangri-La while they did a spotcheck everyweek. And here, we use one chopping board and there's no colour coded knifes and chopping board. In the chiller, only clean one in a while and it wasn't as sistematic as in Golden Sands. Talking about 5 stars hotel...??     My whole body is aching coz too tired. I getting less time to go to gym. I hate that!! I getting less rest.. I'm having a minor migraine back since this morning. I need to start my speech to be submited tomorrow for review by mss anne.     Parry and me always talking about getting more money, yeah we need money to survive in this material worlds, but then again I was thinking that right now, all i need is experience to get establish in this cullinary world. But she need more money to indulge with new clothing and any  many self-indulgement. With I need to, but have to hold everything back... have to be patience. Right now, it's now the right time for me to spend, I have to save coz for my US working thingy.

Give me a comment, please.. At first I didn't even know, what the hell is valedictorian is? So I thought it must be something la.. to represent something.. then I got to know it is the best student thingy... hehe stupid haa??  Ok ok enoug bout this. Something happened during the last day of the orientation of the new staffs in Hilton. There's 3 among us, steal candy bar from the mini bar in the exec suite during the house tour.

      I know, it's been a while since my last post. I'm too tired to type since I'm working. I confirm my job in Hilton, now is underprobation for 3 months. My Hiltonian members esp the Paya Serais' staffs are still a jackass. But last Saturday, I did OC (outside catering) in Menara Telekom, I worked about 18 hours. From 7am till 1am. Ohh, I did a lot of OT since I joined. Coz the senior are too fucking lazy. Nevermind as long as I got paid, it's ok. I got to know some of the other outlet staffs. Some are friendly and some are snob. Biasalah... But had an argument with this bitch in Cold Kitchen, coz I had to refill the buffet, and I help them (the cold kitchen items) to get refilled, and this girl keep rising her voice to me said that she's busy... And it happened few times, I could take it, but until she keep doing it until I get annoyed and I scold her back. I told her to quit her job and find other job if she didn't like it. And I told her not to rise her voice to me, I already help her, so that she didn't have to walk all the way to the restaurant and take the item to get refilled. I was pissed... And the other cold kitchen knows about it. Don't think that I'm a new staff they can do that to me. I'm not uptight, but they the one who uptight. I got BJ's phone number today.. I'm very happy!! I think that I'm gonna get sick tomorrow... I might a flu... Shit!!! Ohh...!! My dad got robbed again!! This is the second time he got robbed. My brother said it's quite bad, he been beaten by the helmet. That's all...

      Last two nights, I hanged out with Azam in KL for whole night. I didn't paid a single sen for it. Paid by his friend. My other yum cha girlfriends called me. But I have to give my priority to him, since he's been my good friend for almost 10 years. And the last time I saw him was 7 months ago, he helped me to send my stuffs to Penang. He spend a night with me.  Morning, my elder brother, nephew (Adam) and my parents visited me. My first sis-in-law didn't came coz my niece is in the hospital. I hope she's getting better. OOO... My parents gonna get a new bike for me...  I went to gym after so long being ignoring bout gym. I went with Suleen. Later then, went to One Utama with her and Chings, Susan and some of their friends. And this there's a guy named R, which I feel that he didn't like me. Coz later, we had yum cha, he said something to Susan about me, but I didn't hear, but Susan asked him to shut-up. This guy is rude... Extremly fucking rude. He kept looking at me... What's wrong with you man?? I didn't do anything wrong to you... Before we left, he asked Chings what's my name. HELLO YOU MORON, we'd been introduced before in Burger King!!! STUPID ASSHOLE DUSHBAG DWEEB MORON!!! Of course being a gentleman, I said my name and shook hand with him... And Chings told me, he's been like that to all her guy friends before. What a LOOSER!!!  Tomorrow will be my first day in Shangri-La.. Hope for the best... Good night...
