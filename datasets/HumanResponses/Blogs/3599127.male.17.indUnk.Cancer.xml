      So yea, I just made this blog to ease the misery known as boredom. Dunno yet if its gonna help me any, but the past 10 minutes or so just flew by so we're on a good start.  Anywho since this is my first blog I guess I need to thoroughly introduce myself. I dont exactly understand what these are for, but they're cool anyways.  My names Joe...Joe Krietemeyer if you want details. I live in Evansville, Indiana, have lived here in the same house since BIRTH. Im not complaining though.   Im 16, but I'm gonna turn 17 on July 17th, 1987.   Currently, well not right now because its summer, but in the fall I'll be headed back to good ol' Harrison High School where dreams are crushed on a daily basis. Not really, but it really does suck there. I'll be a junior, hurrah. 2 years and I'm out. I'm really glad. Not looking forward to like a total of 4 hours in homeroom the first week back because my teacher is a fucking whore, but I'll deal..or she will. We'll see.  I live with my parents, not gonna list my address, Jeff and Debbie. We got 3 cats, 2 dogs and I have 2 highly annoying turtles. Cats are Isabelle(Izzy), she's like 10 or 11 and really, really fat. As they say on MTV, you think you know but you have NO idea. This bitch is plump. The other one is Sammy, hes a dude. 2 y/o, all black, nosy. The other is Patches, gay name, hes a lil over 1 I think, schizophrenic but lovey. Dogs are Heidi, I dunno how old but getti up their..the other is Klaus..hes maybe 8? Hes her baby though, literally. She only had 1 puppy. Hes startin to look old too but hes still hyper. Turtles have no names, nor will they ever if they continue to piss me off. I usually just call them shut the hell up and stop it. They make a lot of noise splashin water everywhere. They just sit there and swim back and forth like all day making this BLOOP BLOOP BLOOP! noise. Gets old. They would probably eat an enitre human if I put one in the tank, but then they'd be fat. I try to keep their food low, but sometimes I gotta throw a few sprinkles of delicious turtle pellets in there to shut them up. I THINK theyre both males, I wouldnt put money on it though. Im not the Croc Hunter, damnit. They do some kind of territorial thing with their feet, looks like there...I dunno what the hell it looks like, but they do it. The other night I thought they got into a fight cuz they were like latched onto eachother, but I think they might have just got their nails caught together. Anyways, they were thrashing around and making a scene. I wouldnt want to have to slap a bitch, now, would I?   Lets see what else. Eh, I dont really like picking a FAVORITE thing of a group of em like movies, music, tv, song, etc. I did put a few dicky lists on my personal profile or whatever, I dunno if they even show up..but yea, theyre a few. I have too many. Chappele's Show is def. the best thing on TV right now, I will say that.  Speaking of which, supposedly theyre going to make an entire movie with Dave Chapelle about Rick James, with him PLAYING Rick James like in the Charlie Murphy THS sketch. I will def. see that shit, whoo.  Yea, I gues my #1 interest would probably be wrestling. I watch it on TV every Monday night, read rumours and stories on the internet,....roleplay... :-| other stuff. Anyways, yea, I know wrestling is fake..everyone does. But most people unlike me THINK they know wrestling is stupid, fake, nothing real about it. Those people would be wrong. Yea, wrestling is fake, they know how to punch and kick without it hurting, they know how to fall. But dont you think it would start hurting falling on your backs like 20 times a night, every week, all year? Yea, its called wear and tear. Injuries can and do happen, and the wrestlers dont all get along behind the scenes. Its like any other work place. They play politics, a lot of shit. Wrestling on screen is almost 100% always just fake, for TV stuff..but real wrasslin fans watch it for the storylines, feuds, good matches and shit just like people watch the fuckin OC for the drama or the soap operas for the storylines. Same thing, different way of doing it. Its hard to get people to understand it, and I hate talking about it with people who are clueless about it. And no, wrestling is not entirely choreographed. Do you REALLY think you could hop in a ring and remember 20 minutes of stuff you were supposed to do? Most people have it in their head that Hulk Hogan is wrestling. Stupid legdrops, body slams, ripping the shirt, fans cheering. Well, in the 80's WWF, it was, but not anymore. Real wrestlers get in the ring and put on a match, they tell a story through it, they dont know everything to do but they do plan out some of the bigger "spots", or moments, in the match. The stuff in between is usually spur of the moment, they know what theyre doing. Argh, I hate talking about it.  Anyways, right now I really dunno what else to type. This blog is really fucking long though. Ill post some time else to talk about my day or some shit.
