      No Peace in America Penalty's set maximum Die in unappealing debt Of Happiness not met  So Lets resort to stealing Cause our money is out Compare it to them killing Hapiness conquers doubt  We are no longer afraid to smile But it is still unlawful Watch as the government frowns Their purblind hearts are dull Watch as we retaliate Combined in one scream  is all the hate.   Basically thats about how the government totally screws us over. We are afraid to live. It just describes how hard it is for us to be happy.

      They look for your Flaws Depicting your every move We will tear down these walls To ask them what'd they prove Because we aren't in the same room We wouldn't get to We are shunned to the door Understand their life's worth more They are supposed to guide, mold us rather It's them that lied And pushed us farther Because one to many threats Brings us down Resulting in gregarious debts And immutable Frowns

      Slap yourself across the face Run, almost to first base. Get in your car and wreck it, Halfway to second. Slit your wrist and fall to the floor, Crawl to third If you're feeling alone, You've made it to home.  I wrote that poem a while back. back when some of my friends wanted to kill themselves or were depressed.

       So, you need a recap on my life. Well. Here it goes. Mainly I sit at home, Which is definatly not good. I have way too much time on my hands. Everytime I go out its like a major fashion statement. Good or Bad..i dunno. Probley bad. Yesterday, i think it was, I went to Walmart with durb and my mom to get Colored Pencils to put through my hair..ya know..like asians do with chopsticks? something like that. it looks real neat. ha. who would have thought. Today I went to Durbs band practice. they  WOW  me. if wow is a verb. They just rock hard. totally original.;-) cant wait till their next show. They did excellant at the Pirate Fest. D u r b went mad with his guitar. hes fun to watch. on or off stage.;-) lets see. So is anyone else taking Clothing and Textiles this year? I'm hoping im gonna get to make stuff. i like rippin up clothes and then putting them back together. wow im gay. okay about my guitar. I'm basically giving up on that. I just want to play drums. I'll probley end up selling my guitar. so if you want to buy it..maybe you can completly talk me into it. i like playing music.But i think i make a better groupie...well not groupie..but fan..Oh, so I'm a vegetarian. I am just so against animal cruelty. I should join PETA. haha...My dad thinks I am turning Liberal on him. But I am not. I Believe you should be able to carry guns. I dont think you should HAVE to wear your seatbelt. Abortions arent right. ANd I belive in the Death Penalty. so there you go. NOT LIBERAL. I hate government. The slaugher house that kills the chicken for KFC beats them.(the chickens). they throw them up against walls and stomp on them. its not right. oh geez. im so sure you wanted to hear about all that. anyways i should really go. i  love  durb. I mean that.-KC
