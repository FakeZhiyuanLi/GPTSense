      Dear Ebay, I received the following when I tried to bid today:  "You have been suspended from eBay because our records indicate your account was involved in activities that violate our policies. If you feel you have been suspended in error or want to appeal this decision by providing additional information, please contact us."  I have absolutly no idea what kind of horrorendous thing that I may have do to warrent this type of rather offensive and accusatory type of treatment.  It seems, from your verbage, that I've commited something so incrediable that apparently only a thread suspends me from certain death or, as a last resort, lifetime banishment from your establishment.  Let me say, that your terrible words have certainly made me reconsider my entire opinion of Ebay, moving me from naive and wholehearted supporter of Ebay, to a place of downright fearful disbelief that I may have your company all wrong and you're not the kind of people I may have once thought you were.    Anyway, I've not used my Juno dialup in a while now and have forgotten to check my email there (you know how it is, everybody slaps one email account in your face after another until they're everywhere and yet STILL you're running from a spam avalanche.  I don't know anyone who can reasonably maintain an email account for more than a six month to one year period before its so overwhelmed by spam that, like the oakies in the Grapes of Wrath, you're forced to move on whether you like it or not, and start a new email account that you can use until it, too, is spammed to death. and you're forced on to another email.)  Anyway, I've not been checking my Juno email lately.  Apparently my credit card expired and you sent me an email about it but I didn't get it.  Then I notice that you dunned me almost to spam-like purportions to get your $7.00 on that Juno email.  Then, apparently because I didn't get the email I didn't realize the credit card I was using for Ebay had expired.  Sorry.  I'd love to have had you deduct it from my credit card as you normally would, it just never occured to me to consider my card with you might be out of date, since the handful I have are always expiring or sending me bills, or pleading for me to spend more, or pleading for me to send them more money, or pleading with me to do this bullshit and that bullshit and it never ends with them.    But, back to you.  Frankly, to be treated in this manner by you over $7 is downright shocking.  Have you and your programmers absolutely no sense of purportion or simple common sense?  $7, to most businesspeople would be treated with a kind gentility that would encourage people to continue being their customers. As most people would assume that $7 is certainly not enough to actually be what the problem might be.  At that low level, most sane people would agree that there might be something else going on with that customer and forgive or address it kindly at the appropriate time in a genteel way.  Who would purposley destroy themselves over $7?   No one.  Sane people would not act insane and send out reams of spam over it, nor treat their customer with such disrespect upon their next visit to their establishment.  Instead they might just forget it, or more likely, casually mention it while the custoemr was shopping.    Unlike you, which barred me from the store with threats that I could never shop there again until I did something about it.  And even then, used such words as to seem to insinuate that I was just a whisper away from being a criminal of Enron purportions.  Ken Lay may be able to steal with such shamelessness and commit theft on such a massive scale that it ranks him among the most notorious thieves that ever lived that I suspect you might actually consider barring him.  Who would want such a monster in their midst?  Probably only O.J. They're certainly in the same class of human destruction.  They certainly should both be banished to their own little island for the duration of their lives.  But we're talking about me, shameless $7 marauder that I seem to be in your eyes.    So, lets talk about this $7.  What do you want from me now.  You've barred me from trying to pay you.  I even tried to pay through my Pay Pal account (which they were quite willing to do) but you hushed Pay Pal too and told them you had no outstanding bills for me. That makes no sense.  Are you even interested in me as a customer anymore?  And, god, what is all this "serious violation" stuff that warrents me being kick from your eden?     But, what you have cost me in time this afternoon trying to figure out your stuff, in spite of your barred doors and haughty attitude, means that at this point you really own ME.  Where I work I bill no less than $50 an hour.  I've spent a good two hours AT LEAST trying to determine what you've done to my account and how to correct it using your system.  But, to no avail.  So, I figure at this point you owe ME at least $100 (less your $7, I know you certainly won't let anybody in your sandbox who won't ante up first....gee, isn't it only the Mafia that demands every penny OR ELSE?... what were you planning next?....break a few of my fingers?....put "the hurt" on my poor granny?)  So, again, what do you want from me.  I know how stupid computer programmers can be where business sense is concerned, so I can certainly see you've got some firing to do among the people who plan and design this part of your system, so I'm willing to give you a second chance.  At this point, I owe you $7.  You've spammed me mercilessly (as I discovered opening my Juno email account for the first time in a while today).  You've insulted me.  You've wasted a lot of my time and should really be paying me the net of $93 that you really owe me now.  So, tell me.  Help me.  Gimmie a sign that you're not just a big computer monster that has already gotten so out of hand that no human spirit is left in you and that you're just a massive program that could run on endlessly without any humans at all now.  Tell me you're still, at the core, of flesh and blood like the rest of us.    If you're not.  Well, then maybe your slogan "Do you know the way to Ebay" could really just be the devil in disguise luring us all down the highway to hell.  I'll be checking my Juno email for a while, just to see what you will do.  Yours Truly, Holden Spark

      I do not find any truth or value in any religion or in any form of religion, or in any religious-like belief structures.   Religion is the most destructive force on the planet today.  It has been the most destructive force for thousands of years.  During this time the giant religions of the world have honed their manipulative and deceitful ways achieving the rather startling result of calling lies the truth and doing it with such bald-faced abandon that I doubt religious people of today even realize that what they're doing is living in a fantasy world and forcing all those around them to endure their insanity.  Anyone who practices a religion is insane.  Its an acquired insanity, most often forced upon them as defenseless children and one which they mindlessly and without knowledge of what they do, force the same insanity upon their own children.  Teaching a child lies is a terrible form of child abuse.  The reality is all religions and every church on every corner are horrific palaces of child abuse, herding all the little defenseless children into Sunday schools and feeding them lies when the little children have no defenses against such things.    Religion is much too dangerous for children to be exposed to.  It is something that only adults, like tobacco, alcohol and other adult activities, should be allowed to pursue.  Our children need protection from religion until they are 18, have become legal adults and are able to decide for themselves if they wish to join a religion.  Religion is the most addictive drug ever created by mankind.  It creates insanity with prolonged use and causes parents to force their children to become addicted to this drug while they are still little children and unable to know that they are becoming addicted to a drug and it is their unwitting fate to become slaves of this drug all their lives.   This insanity is epidemic in our society. We MUST begin and complete a campaign to get laws passed which protect our children from this vicious cycle.  I fully support an adult's right to control their body, and joining a religion is an individual choice an adult can make for themselves if they wish.  In fact, this is is what the first amendment ACTUALLY protects:  the freedom that an adult should be allowed to decide for himself or herself whether the drug of religion is right for them.  I see no reason to deny an adult the right to join a religion if he or she chooses.  Like any drug, adults decide all the time what drugs are right for them.  But, for children, it's a different matter.  If the public schools started teaching bald-faced lies, presenting them as truth, communities would explode in uproar and immediately mobilize to get that child abuse stopped and only facts being taught in school once again.    But then these same people take their little children to church and embark on a progressive, repeated and systematic plan to cause their children to go insane by presenting them with lies and calling those lies truth.  Nothing is being done to protect our children from this relentless child abuse.  And so the cycle continues.  Most religions offer the most obscene and unbelievable lure imaginable.  The promise of life after death.  I can see how this lie would be hard for an adult to resist.  I cannot imagine how a child could resist it, nor be able to give it up when he grew up.  He became addicted to it as a child and will have to live his life in the slavery of addiction, which is what religion really is.  The time has come for us to take up the very difficult task of trying to get laws passed which protect our children from the child abuse and addiction of religion.  It may be a long road, but to ultimately, finally, liberate one generation from this addiction, would have the affect of awakening our fellows out of their very long sleep and might finally break this cycle of addiction from repeating itself from one generation to the next.  We must begin to encourage the American Psychiatric Association to study the damage done to children caused by the child abuse they suffer as children forced to accept the addiction of religion without defenses.  Further, the APA should then define and name this acquired insanity that religion crushes upon our defenseless children, listings the causes, symptoms, and methods of treatment.  The Aquired Insanity brought on by by religion is an illness so widespread in our society that it's not even, yet, seen as an illness.  But, it is, in fact, a destructive force of such magnatude that it has the power to deceive its victims into believing they are well when they are, in fact, seriously mentally ill.  Our society is in the grip of this destructive mental illness.  We must begin to start treating it as such.  A destruction it is reeking on all of us, every day.  That this affliction remains untreated and undiagnosed, yet is a pandemic all around us, causes my heart to weep for all the adults who have been suffering from it all their lives and not ever being told how ill they are or being offered treatment, and also for all the little children who are being emotionally raped every single Sunday for the first eighteen years of their lives.  This insanity is going on still.  Its frightening to behold.  Let's work to make laws to protect our children from religion, just as we protect them from tobacco and alcohol and drugs.  Lets work to get the illness of religious addiction defined, and then work to find treatments for the terrible insanity it afflicts upon its victims.  Beyond that, lets make laws that specifically require that only truth be taught to children, nothing else.  Such that anyone who knowingly, purposely and with intent to deceive teaches a child lies, lies of such vastly destructive power such as the profound lies that religions teach, will have committed a crime.  Denying a child the truth is denying the child mental health.  The theft of a child's mental health meets the definition of crime because it meets the natural test for a crime, theft.  People who lie to children willingly and knowingly are, in fact, and in terms of natural law, criminals.  Knowing they were taught as children to behave in this criminal manner towards their own children presents an enormous challenge to the mental health professionals in this country.  I hope we begin to protect our children from religious criminals and start to offer help to individuals suffering from religious addiction and to provide treatment to the many millions of insane individuals in this country who are suffering from acquired insanity due to relentless abuse forced upon them by religion during their childhood.

      There is nothing wrong with taking drugs.    We are born into this world with only one thing, our bodies.   When we die, we take only one thing, our bodies.   In between, my only birthright is to be the supreme and final ruler over what is permitted to happen to, on, or in my body.   This birthright is, in fact, freedom itself.     The free individual permits what may happen to their body by granting or withholding their consent.    A natural government has but one duty, to protect the birthright of its individuals.     The reverse of freedom is to cause others to lose their freedom.   The entire history of civilization can be summed up as the conflict between the determination of the individual to keep control of his birthright and the determination of a majority, or state, to claim that the birthright of the individual belongs not to the individual, but to the state.    A government has only one natural reason to exercise a power of majority.  That is to notice when one individual has imposed their will upon another individual without the consent of the imposed upon individual and to rectify the imposition.  Any other reason used to take control of the individual's birthright away from the individual is a perversion of the power of majority.  This means that there is only one crime that it is possible to commit.  Theft.   Theft occurs when an individual takes something owned by another individual without the consent of the owner.  This includes taking another person's property, health, or life.  Anything, which cannot be considered theft, as defined here is, in fact, not a real crime at all.  Any laws, which cannot be considered theft as defined here, are not natural laws.    Laws that are enforced, but are not natural, are really crimes themselves   These laws are the resulting perversions of a majority using its power to grasp control of the individual's birthright away from the individual.    It is thus up to the individual to protest unnatural laws that grasp at his birthright.   As long as a majority continues to grasp for control of the individual's birthright, the struggle for freedom must continue.  All laws that prohibit anyone from choosing any drug to take into their body are unnatural laws and oppose the very essence of freedom.  What I choose for my body is my business.  A crime can only be committed if I force my will upon another without their consent.     Taking drugs is a personal choice.  One can only commit a crime if his actions impose his will upon another without the other's consent.   Our government is imposing drug laws that have no basis in the protection of freedom.  These laws are not natural laws, and are therefore themselves crimes being perpetrated against the American people by its government.  When a government fails in its only duty, the duty to rectify the imposition of an individual's will upon another without the other's consent, then only the individual is left to try and make the government discontinue its criminal behavior.     Our government is in violation of its only duty by perpetrating unnatural laws upon drug users.    However, over time, our government has also been slowly coming to the realization that the individual's birthright must be protected.   This can be seen in the history of the evolution of human rights in this country.  Freedom to African-Americans.  Suffrage for women.   In the last 50 years, we have begun to see a small beginning of acknowledgement by our government of a human's birthright.  This birthright, the right of the individual to control their own body, was acknowledged when Row vs. Wade returned women's natural power over their bodies to them.    The recent court decision overturning sodomy laws is another small step towards the return of the individual's birthright.     The right to control our bodies is our only birthright.  It is, in fact, freedom itself.  This is the fundamental reason for a democracy to exist, so that the people may protect this most basic of all human rights.  Nothing else is as important as when the people exercise their democratic right to retain control of their bodies.    Beware all who lay claim to any part of your birthright.  Without your birthright, you have nothing.  Without your birthright freedom has died.  It will only be reborn when the people reclaim their birthright.

      It's July 4th, 2004 and this is the first day and the first post of my first blog, Elder Duck Down.    What I hope to accomplish here is to breath life into my thoughts on the nature of two human topics: freedom, and sanity.  I hope my ideas will cause those whose eyes are closed to open them.  I plan to cast new light upon and into the future so that those who follow us may see their future in a brighter and more truthful light than many do now.  And I hope that the brighter light will also shine upon the past as well so that those who have opened their eyes can see the past for the first time, as it really was.  Now I need to credit Barbara Taylor Bradford for giving me the inspiration for the title of the blog.  Though I'd never been drawn to her genre before, I had some time to pass and happened across a first edition of her book "Act of Will" that I'd bought at a second hand store as one of fifty collectible books I'd picked up and hoped to make a little extra money selling on-line at ChooseBooks.com.  The book didn't sell after three months (only two books did, though I actually made a profit cause the 50 books only cost $50 but the two books I sold, I sold for $50 each, netting me a profit of $50) being one of the tiny cashe of 48 books that I'd only bought for their potential First Edition value without consideration as to if I'd read them or not, simply planning to sell them all.  But, after three months I had other things to do and took my list of remaining 48 books down from ChooseBooks.com.  So, one quiet smoky evening at home I felt like reading something light and picked up her book.  The story, though predictable, was an easy read and kept my attention.  By the end of the book, though I didn't feel much enlightened, I did feel relaxed, like I'd just had a nice little vacation from reality, which was all I wanted from those moments of reading anyway.  In the book Barbara mentions how one blanket stuffed with elder duck down can keep a person warmer than a pile of regular blankets would, but only the rich can afford such high quality.  I thought and thought and thought about elder duck down.  And I thought about freedom and sanity and where we get our ideas about those things.  And I thought about comfort, and how expensive it is.  And I thought of all the people in the world who can't afford that kind of dependable comfort, so they make up things to comfort themselves, and let themselves believe they are truly comfortable in their beliefs.  Many have never even imagined elder duck down, and many have heard of it but never experienced it so don't believe.  So they teach their children to believe what they believe.  And their children call these beliefs comforting.    Still, there is something better should they try and find it.  But feathers are light and its quite a feat for a person to collect enough to experience it and shatter their old beliefs.  But for the very very very few who let their beliefs be shattered in the light of truth, they find themselves saddened that their elders had not understood reality and saddled with the need to try and explain the true nature of comfort in a world where most's comfort is make-believe.  But old men and old women are uncomfortable to learn their beliefs were untrue.  So they choose not to learn.  And so they end their lives as drugged as when they began.  Lost in the drug of belief, eyes tightly closed to reality.  Here I hope to shine a light.  Though here is the only place it can be seen, when the elders duck down, here these words will be.  And it will brighten the way for those who have been freed from belief.  Another step towards sanity.
