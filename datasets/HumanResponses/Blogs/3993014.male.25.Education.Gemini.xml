      Ahhh...yes.  The little ones are struggling through their first Biology test of the year and the room is (temporarily) quiet.  The school year has gotten off to a surprisingly smooth start.  This morning in teacher's meeting, we were wondering when the other shoe is going to drop.   Chris over at  urlLink Moonradio  has posted production stills and festival info for the short film "Sinners and You", which I had the pleasure of writing and...gaffing, I guess is the word.  More info should show up online in the near future.  I saw the rough cut and it looks really good, even at this early stage.

      I received this from a friend and decided to post it here instead of forwarding more junk email!  :)  Enjoy!     1. You accidentally enter your password on the microwave.  2. You haven't played solitaire with real cards in years.  3. You have a list of 15 phone numbers to reach your family of 3.  4. You e-mail the person who works at the desk next to you.  5. Your reason for not staying in touch with friends and family is that they don't have e-mail addresses.  6. You go home after a long day at work you still answer the phone in a business manner.  7. You make phone calls from home, you accidentally dial "9" to get an outside line.  8. You've sat at the same desk for four years and worked for three different companies.  10. You learn about your redundancy on the 11 o'clocknews.  11. Your boss doesn't have the ability to do your job.  12. You pull up in your own driveway and use your cell phone to see if anyone is home.  13. Every commercial on television has a website at the bottom of the screen.  14. Leaving the house without your cell phone, which you didn't have the first 20 or 30 (or 60) years of your life, is now a cause for panic and you turn around to go and get it.  15. You get up in the morning and go online before getting your coffee.  16. You start tilting your head sideways to smile. :)  17. You're reading this and nodding and laughing.  18. Even worse, you know exactly to whom you are going to forward this message.  19. You are too busy to notice there was no #9 on this list.  20. You actually scrolled back up to check that there wasn't a #9 on this list.

      OK, as anyone who knows me already is aware, I am a news and politics junkie.  So, I come home this afternoon and turn on the TV to the news and notice that apparently  urlLink  the governor of New Jersey is going to resign.  No huge deal to me...I don't live in NJ and the governor of Connecticut resigned a few months ago due to a financial scandal.  "More of the same," I thought.  But then during press conference I caught, this  urlLink huge bombshell  was dropped.   I sat there watching what that governor was saying and I though, "Wow, it sounds like he is going to come out of the closet or something."  Apparently, he is not resigning due to his sexuality.  He is resigning because his former partner is suing for sexual harrassment.  I have to admit that the guy has guts to step up in public and admit this and step down knowing that had he stayed his ability to govern would be compromised.  But the whole thing is still just so...I don't know... strange .  Gotta love election year politics...

      The mad rush has begun and my simple summer life of watching Adult Swim until 3:00 am and sleeping until past noon has ended.  We teachers reported back last Friday and the munchkins join us on Wednesday.  Busy semester ahead as I will be teaching Biology, Physics and Chemistry in block format.  I have to say that in spite of the impending busyness I am ready to go back.  Granted, come August 12th, I will be wishing for the summer again, but for now, I guess I'd better enjoy it while it lasts...

      Yep...this is just what I need.  Another reason to spend time on the Intarweb...like I need an excuse!  :)  Let's see...just finished up what was my first experience with good ole' fashioned independent film last week. I had the privilege of writing a script for my friends Chris and Stephen to fashion into one of those fancy movin' pictures. Lots of fun and quite gratifying to see something you wrote come alive in front of a camera.    We started in-service at the old school today. I am in the position of being mentally ready for school, in spite of having quite a bit of stuff left to do.  Truly a fun and exciting life I lead...
