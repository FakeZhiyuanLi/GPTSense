        Took Place On Saturday, June 5, 2004    In the stead of the 8th Grade Dance, me and Ben went to see  Harry Potter And The Prisoner of Azkaban  the second day it was open.  He had bought the tickets the day before (or at least his mom did), and we had to sit in the theatre for half an hour before the movie actually started to get a seat.  I smuggled Swedish fish into the theatre and ate the whole bag by myself, because Ben had had dinner at Ryan's before the movie.  After the movie, Ben's dad took us to the mall, which was closed.  So we ended up going home.  Ben's dad took me home, with Ben saying, at every house, "It's this one!"  After I got home and had my ceremonial "How My Time Went" chat with my mom, I send Ben an e-mail and thanked him for the movie.  This was his reply: "Your welcome.  Oh, and guess what: you haven't driven me crazy. :)"

        Took Place On Friday, June 4, 2004    The busride to Hershey was excruciatingly boring.  My snacks sucked, we were watching  Shrek , which I'd seen a billion times, I was sitting with a guy I'd never met even slightly, and my gameboy game gave me a headache.  A while into it I got sour powder caught in my throat and coughed up a storm.  A three-hour bus ride under such conditions is like some form of American Chinese water torture.  When we got off the bus, Anderson (my homeroom/science teacher) gave my class our tickets and our group met up together.  It was me, Danielle, Ben, Candace, Greg, Casey, Leann, Eva, Travis, and John Sharetts (who I'll just call Sharetts from here on out).  Ben's dad, who was chaperone, gave us a time to meet at, even though for a while we walked with him.  Until we got through the gates into Hershey Park, because everyone dispersed into the park.  When we got into the gates, I saw a stuffed animal shop.  I told Ben, "After we go on a few rides, you haveta take me back here so I can go in there!"  He didn't say anything.  Danielle wasn't feeling well (she'd just broken up with her boyfriend that morning and her stomach was ill), so she sat down on a bench as soon as we got in.  Leann and Eva and Travis disappeared, because Leann's family was going to be at the park.  Sharetts went with Kristin and Sarah, other people in my clique-thing at school.  Greg and Casey disappeared, and Ben's dad eventually wandered off.  Me, Candace, and Ben want together.  First thing we did was go on this rollercoaster called  Trailblazer .  Getting off it, I felt  extremely  stupid, because I had been nervous about it and it ended up being a kiddie rollercoaster.  After that, the juvenile I am, I talked Candace and Ben into going on the Tilt-A-Whirl with me.  Ben was subtly laughing, presumably at himself, I was giggling like a toddler, and Candace was laughing at  me .  After the Tilt-A-Whirl, we were walking, and I stopped to look at the ducks and the huge fish in the water.  Ben threatened to throw me over after about a minute or two, so I started walking again.  We met up with Ben's dad a little while later.  Ben got iced tea and put lots of syrup in it (pure sugar, you know).  After Ben bummed a few potato things off his dad, we left to find the zoo.  Ben promptly got us lost, walked us all the way to the wrong side of the park, and then proceeded to lead us in the correct direction the long way.  While we were lost, I stated the obvious.  And Ben said: "I'll use my psychic navigating skills to get us there!"  I asked, "What psychic navigating skills?"  Ben replied, grinning, "I know, that's why I always get lost."  At the zoo, they gave us blacklight stamps to show that we'd been admitted (although it was invisible without the blacklight), and we went in.  The first place we went was a reptile house.  There were all sorts of snakes and lizards and turtles in there, and at the end was a lonely-looking gator.  I sat down next to the glass close to his head and said hullo and asked him how he was doing.  I got no reply, of course, other than Candace telling me I was an idiot and Ben telling me I should hurry up.  After the reptile house, we went into yet another house.  This one was the Desert House or somesuch, where they two desert birds living together.  Then, attached, was the Nocturnal Mammal room, which was pitch black.  We went in, and looked at an opossum.  It was sleeping in a hole, all balled up comfy-like.  I went to the next window, one housing a skunk, and there was nothing there.  "It died." I said, jokingly.  Candace replied, "Yeah.  Every animal that isn't here  died ."  Then I turned to the other wall, and it was a vampire bat.  The three of us looked for the bat, instinctively on the ceiling, but he wasn't there.  I looked down at the water bowl, and there he was, licking away at the dark liquid.  But I could tell it wasn't water.. It was too dark and it looked  red .  "Oh my God, it's got cow's blood!" I whisper-yelled.  "No it doesn't," Ben tried to tell me.  But I know he was wrong.  Because vampire bats drink animal blood, and they definitely  do not  drink water.  There were lots of other cute nocturnal aminals (yes,  aminals ) there, but, again, I was hurried along by my dear too-grown-up friends.  After we left the House of Nox (dubbed so by  moi ), there were no more houses.  We saw bison in the distance, and a turkey, and lots of things we didn't actually see but looked like they were there anyhow.  Ben, being, well,  Ben , followed the signs (although when he'd done that to  get  to the zoo, he'd become hopelessly lost for the fact that the two signs pointed back at each other), and led us toward the wolf exhibit (because he knows my obsession with wolves, strange as that is).  We passed a fenced-in place with deer, a buck and a doe (wow, I'm using my vocabulary here),  as well as the turkey, who stared evilly at me and gobbled threateningly.  We saw many other animals as well, only that my memory sucks like a vacuum and I can't remember what they were.  We had to go over a bridge-like thing (it went over the water, therefor was a bridge), and since I had a quarter from buying a lemonade earlier, I got some feed and fed the duckies and a rabbit that happened to have made friends with the duckies.  Then we moved on 'cause Candace and Ben were becoming exasperated again with my jovial duck-feeding.  Once we reached the wolf, it was a big disappointment that he--a magnificently black wolf--wasn't in the mood for a chat, because he was lying down behind a rock, presumably sleeping, and all I could see was a bit of his back.  After we visited him, we found ourselves a niche where we watched the ducks again.  Candace looked at a swan and called it a goose, and Ben scolded (ok,  yelled at ) her for not knowing the difference.  My comment was, "It's a bird that swims."  After that, we walked again.  We walked over toward the bison.  There were two at what I can only assume were watering/feeding troughs, and one that was laying down.  I wanted to talk to the bison, but I didn't know how the hell a bison would speak.  So I  moo ed at it.  Yes, I  moo ed at the damn bison, OK?  After being called a moron, an idiot, and a dumbass several times, we moved on to the mountain lion.  There were stairs leading up to a fence that with the  MOUNTAIN LION  sign, and I was walking up it, and then I thought aloud: "You know, this doesn't seem like a bright idea."  My friends (those chickens!) didn't follow me up, so it was much easier to get down.  Ben notified me that there was another place where you could see them from (without getting you eyes clawed out), and I followed him and Candace there.  The mountain lions, there were two of them, were both sleeping.  So we went over to visit the prairie dogs.  The prairie dogs both had different reactions to us: one of them (probably the female) froze up and stopped moving, while the other one  started  moving and worked on building (kinda ironic, isn't it?) his hole.  I walked over to where the frozen one would have probably been staring, and I said hullo to it.  I sat down with my eyes level with the prairie dog's and just stared for a while.  The prairie dog didn't move.  Then I clucked at it.  "I wish I had a rock."  Ben said, watching the prairie dog working on his hole.  "Don't throw a rock at it!! That's mean!" I scolded him.  "I was just gonna help it.." Ben defended.  "By knocking it in the head with a rock?!"  Yeah, I won that argument.  After that, we walked on to the porcupines.  Me and Ben had a "can not"-"can too" argument over whether porcupines really shoot out their quills (which they don't).  Neither of us won, because I knew we were both hardheaded enough to argue for the rest of the trip and I called it off before that could happen.  Next, we saw the bear exhibit.  'Cept no bears.  There was a building labeled SOMETHING  BEAR EXPERIENCE .  We all went in, and there was a stupidly-placed wall near the back wall.  Ben went around the wall and found a platform, which was in front of a large mirror.  Candace and I followed, and what do we see but  bears  (that's a real kicker, huh?) sleeping right next to the window.  The one closest the window is chewing on and playing with a little rock; the one lying next to him is lying on his back, sprawled out, with his mouth hung  wide  open; the third one, who was lying farther away from the others, was just peacefully snoozing away.  Then we left the bears to their slumber (after, that is, gawking at them for a while) and headed toward the exit.  We passed by the deerfolk again and said hullo, then passed by the evil turkey.  I  bagawk ed at the turkey as we left the zoo.  After the zoo, we walked around again.  (Jee, recurring theme, that walking around stuff.)  I believe that was when we found the video game arcade.  We went in, looking for Ben's dad (at least, I think we did).  I played 3 quarters worth of pinball, boring Ben and Candace to death.  We went outside afterward so Ben could call his dad on his cell.  Ben's dad eventually came, and we went back into the arcade.  Ben played against me in Hydro Thunder twice, brutalized me, played once by himself.  Then I took him over to play a motorcycle racing game.  Ben and I were almost neck-and-neck near the beginning of the race, and I found the use for that handy  ATTACK  button on the left handle.  Then our game timed out and I got first place.  After that, Ben played this kid at Tekken 4.  Then he played me.  Whooped me big-big.  Then he played Tekken 4 against his dad repeatedly (I stopped counting after one or two matches).  Candace went over to talk to Travis, Vicki, and the other people they were with.  I played Skeeball.  Then sometime after that, we were aimlessly walking, and I stopped again to observe the ducks, this time from a really high-up bridge.  Once again, Ben threatened to throw me over, with a "Why don't you jump in!".  So I started yet walking again.  I believe around then was when we found Natty, Kaylor, Viral, and Tyler Brown.  Ben halloo'd Natty, but they all walked right through him.  Once we were positive we'd found the pit of all that was Nobody-Is-Here, we sat down and just kinda people-watched.  We pointed out the groups of people wearing the same shirts (the purple, the blue, the orange, the red-like..) and watched for people we knew.  Needless to say, we didn't find anyone.  When we walked again, and Ben was walking extremely fast because "his aspirin was wearing off". (He'd hurt his leg playing football the other day, and he took aspirin to relieve the pain.)  I told him to slow down, and when he didn't I started basically whining. (I had told him earlier that week that it was guaranteed that he would be  extremely  sick of me by the end of the week.)  He said, "I thought you said  I  would get sick of  you , not the other way around!"  After a while of me yelling at him to slow down, I guess Ben let his selective hearing kick in, and he stopped listening to me altogether.  He told me and Candace that he can hear perfectly well when he's selectively hearing when someone is talking  about  him, so I turned to Candace and said, "You know, I'm gonna jump on him if he doesn't   slow down !"  Ben turned around and gave me a funny look.  But he waited.  Ben took me back to the stuffed animal store, but he wouldn't go in with me.  Neither would Candace.  Then I realized they were all Beanie Babies, which I'm not particularly fond of, and I decided to save my money.  After a while, Candace spotted Chelsea and Samantha.  She left with them, because my chickenshitness was boring her, I guess, and she wanted to actually  do  something.  How odd is that?  After she left, we made our way to  Wildcat , the country's fastest wooden rollercoaster.  Oh, joy.  Before this day, I'd never been on a roller coaster, and now I was going on a recordholder.  That's a step up, ain't it, folks?  Well, my stomach was squirming like it was full of spiders the whole way up, and I thought I'd die of a heart attack when we were getting on.  After it started, though, I had no time to freak out.  I was too busy chanting "Oh shit!".  Ben laughed at me the entire time.  After  Wildcat , Ben and I were going down toward the next roller coaster he wanted to torment me with, called  Lightning Racer .  He called his dad, who was mysteriously in the plaza-like place that we had to get through to get to the coaster.  We stopped to talk to him about his icky funnel cake (he said it, not me), and I got Ben to go on a Music-Go-Round kind of ride.  He had to sit on the left because he was the heaviest, and I sat on the right, but as soon as the ride picked up speed, we were both on the left side, crammed together by gravity.  Damned gravity.  After the Music-Go-Round, Ben, his dad, and I went to  Lightning Racer .  The line wasn't too bad, and we got to the top fairly quick.  Ben and I went on Lightning, and Ben's dad went on Thunder.  Once the "race" had begun (even though it was technically set for Thunder to lose), I began chanting again, except this time it was "I hate you, I hate you, God I hate you so much right now!".  After the ride ended, Ben and I couldn't figure out how to unlatch the bar so we could get out.  It's a "push-down-pull-up" thing, and we didn't know until someone told us.  When we got off and were walking down, he said, "Yeah, and we're supposed to be the  smart  ones."  When we got off  Lightning Racer , Ben's dad realized he'd lost his cell phone.  While he searched for it, me and Ben went wandering off again.  We met up with Kristin and Sharetts and John Donahoe near the water rides, and we chatted for a while.  (Well,  they  chatted, I just stood there.  I was hungry.)  Then we left them so that I could get the Chinese noodles that I realized when we got to the Wok & Roll that I wasn't hungry for.  The roller coasters had made me lose my appetite.  So we walked around.  We found Natty by himself, so we sat down and talked to him for a minute or so.  He offered me a French fry.  (Yes, I ate  one  French fry.  Those Boardwalk Fries aren't that good anyway.)  Then he left to catch up to his group.  After that, we walked again.  At some point between that and the final meeting to leave, Ben's dad bought me French fries and a Coke, and we sat on a bench for a while.  Candace and Chelsea found us then.  I remember that Ben's dad gave me a stuffed shark with a surfboard and a bulging stomach (I tell everyone that it's the hand of the surfer he ate), whom I lovingly have named "Jawge the Frog".  After waiting for Travis and Leann to come so we could leave, our group was the last to get to the bus (other than the teachers that had stayed behind to wait for Travis and Leann).  We didn't know which bus was ours.  We knew they were Shrock buses, and Ben and I knew that one was the same bus from Pittsburgh, but we couldn't find them.  Eventually, we  did , obviously, locate our bus and get on, after Ben and I fussed a little over who went into the bus first.  I convinced Michael (the guy I was sitting next to) to trade seats with Ben, who got stuck sitting with Jeff (a dumbass I know).  I asked Jeff to trade me seats first, but he didn't want to sit next to Michael, so I figured I'd just bring Michael to him.  On the bus, Ben shared his Swedish fish with me (he knows I love them), and I eventually finished the entire bag.  My appetite had come back, I guess.  Jawge and I took a little nap on the way home, and when we got home Mom and Dad got to meet Ben's dad a little.  I talked all the way home about my misadventures at Hershey Park.

       There's pain inside I cannot live with it It feels like no one really understands  "Pain Inside" by Adema   I feel like I'm falling in a downward spiral.  It's horrible.  Talking about it doesn't even help anymore.  I want to cry until my tears are gone and scream until I've lost my voice and concuss myself and scratch myself until I feel more physical pain than emotional and mental.  Ryan told me to sleep, but the voices keep telling me not to.  And I'm afraid of what'll happen if I don't listen to them.  It's not that I don't wanna do what Ryan says--if he told me to jump off a bridge, I probably would, if not only for the fact that I've been on a suicide run lately..  The voices don't want me to sleep.  They're punishing me.  I don't really know why.. but I don't want them to yell at me anymore, and I don't want them to make me hurt myself.  I don't really mean to worry Ryan.. I don't really want to worry  anyone .. I just want to die.  Two "signs of depression" I read somewhere the other day: unexplainable feelings of guilt, loss of interest in things you once loved.  I wouldn't be fucking surprised.  I'd say I've lost interest in things.  I haven't been able to write anything of note lately, not even  poetry , everything on televison's been boring me, I haven't even felt like talking anymore..  I feel lonely, and empty.. Like I'm on the inside of the glass while everyone else is on the outside..   "You can see but don't touch.  Stupid child."   But at the same time, I can tell I'm pushing everyone away.. I don't understand what's going on with me..  I feel like a walking corpse, and I know it's not the music.  ...Please help me...  There's pain inside I cannot live with it It feels like no one really understands  "Pain Inside" by Adema

       I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress  Hand full of anger, held in my chest  And everything left's a waste of time,  I hate my rhymes, but hate everyone else's more   "Nobody's Listening" by Linkin Park      That about sums it all up, huh? Well, for once in this weblog, I'm going to address other people's issues before my own, because I'm worried about other people right now, I guess. I don't give a damn about you, Scaccia.    First of all, there's Ryan. He's really worrying me.. I think he's going through some serious stuff, but he won't tell me much.. If he happens to be reading this, I'm  so  sorry that I'm always talking so morbidly.. I think I know now how worrysome it must be, and I'll try harder not to be that way..    I wish I could feel sure that he's alright, and that if he isn't I would know so..    Then there's Candace. She's not eating, and she's beating herself up inside about it when she does. I'm extremely worried.. she could get seriously ill from not eating..    And then Ben... What worries me about him is all this about him not having many friends and the way it's more than likely affecting him. Social isolation--willful or otherwise--is unhealthy for the heart. God, I sound like a sucker, but I'm serious.. I wish things were better for him.    Why, you may wonder, am I not addressing my own issues like I'd usually do? I think it's because I don't really know what my own issues  are  anymore.  If I ever  did  know.  That pit of everlasting darkness has no explanation, I guess.  And I'll continue to fall until someone can reach me...     I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress   Hand full of anger, held in my chest   And everything left's a waste of time,   I hate my rhymes, but hate everyone else's more    "Nobody's Listening" by Linkin Park

       And I'm not sure where I belong. Nowhere's home and I'm all wrong  "Sympathy" by Goo Goo Dolls    I feel lonely.  Even when I'm with my friends.  It really sucks.  I feel like I don't belong anywhere.  Like I'm on the wrong side of the universe or something.  But maybe that's exaggerating a little...  Maybe I'm just on the wrong side of the parallel.  I'm out of mints.. That sucks.   And I'm not sure where I belong. Nowhere's home and I'm all wrong  "Sympathy" by Goo Goo Dolls

						   First of all, I would like to define the following terms:  Evolution : a process of continuous change from a lower, simpler, or worse to a higher, more complex, or better state.  Creation : the act of creating; especially, the act of bringing the world into ordered existence.    The Theory of Evolution Vs. The Theory of Creation   I would like to state, before I continue, that I in no way support either evolutionism or creationism. I am impartial--well, no, fact is that I just  don't care --to both views, and I am only representing the facts which I know.    Evolution Vs. Creation    When it comes to the creation of man, there are two basic standpoints: the  evolutionists  and the  creationists  (I don't know if these are the correct terms, but bear with me).  The evolutionists believe that humans are evolved from primates, and that the human race will continue to evolve and adapt to the world (as we humans make it less liveable and more dangerous to ourselves).  The creationists believe that God created humans as humans, as he created Adam and Eve. Creationists believe that there is nothing before and nothing after being the way we are, and that we may adapt but never evolve.    S o, now we come to the Gan branch of this argument.   The Theory of Evolution of Gan Vs. The Theory of Creation of Gan    Yes, I took the term  Gan , as I use it, from Stephen King's  The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah . The Gan, in King's said novel, is used to indicate the creative overforce. So, by "the theory of evolution of Gan", I mean the theory of creativity evolving over time.    Evolution Vs. Creation of Gan    Now, take the evolutionists and the creationists, and apply those standpoints to the said creative overforce: to writers, artists, musicians, and others who rely on Gan for inspiration and aid.   Evolution : It is said that talents have to be learned, practiced, and honed to really be time-worthy. So the Theory of Evolution of Gan would be that if you do not practice practice practice, your spark and interest will go to waste and you will not be talented in whatever creative field you wish to pursue. (This theory does not, however, include improving upon the talent, because improvement is a normal progression which entails that one has the talent already.)   Creation : I'm sure once in your life, whether talking to a friend or relative, or listening to strangers' conversations, you have heard someone say "I can't help it, I was born this way." I am also sure that you, yourself have said this once or twice to explain your own actions. Can this be said of talents, as well? That some (if not most or even all) of us are born apt to a certain skill or talent at which, as soon as we have experimented with it, we have an uncanny amount of skill? (This, you may say, could be what is called "beginner's luck.")    A Neverending Argument    The tug-o'-war between evolutionists and creationists will go on forever, as long as humans cannot develop technology sophisticated enough to determine the true origins of  homo sapiens . The debate is still hot and rekindles easily when poked, and has been one of society's Great Debates since Charles Darwin published his controversial study   urlLink The Origin of Species   in 1859.

						   First off, I don't much care for either John Kerry or George W. Bush.  They're politicians, and I hate politicians.   Pro's   Bush :  + Bush does have an advantage over Kerry in that he has more experience in the world of politics, having been governor of Texas and the son of a former president. + BUSHISMS, of course!  The best part of George W. Bush's presidency is his speech.    Kerry :   Sorry, folks, I couldn't think of any pro's for Kerry.     Con's    Bush :  Bush isn't the most intelligent person in the world, and his motives for going to war are in question, or at least that was the impression I got from my buddy Devin (Wolf That Cried Man on Blogger). Bush probably  shouldn't  be voted president in the following election, but he started a goddamn war, and he ought to finish it before he gets out of office.    Kerry :  From what I hear (that's all ya have to go on in politics, s'far's I can tell), Kerry is a questionable character. I've heard about medicare issues raised against him, as well as other problems that have raised eyebrows. Also, Kerry, being from the political party he's from (Democrats), would more than likely pull back arms and apologize, then reduce armed forces like Bill Clinton did a few years back. That, undoubtedly (in my mind, anyhow), could allow for another 9/11, and that's not a happy thought for  anyone , nor is it a risk worth taking.   Alright, alright, I admit it! I don't favour John Kerry, alright? I'm sorry, but I want Bush and his Bushisms to finish the war and pull our troops out of Iraq.

						   Coming into my late teenage years (God, I feel old), I have come to realize how hard-headed I am becoming.  My views are actually becoming clearer in matters of opinion with politics, social sciences, the human race, etc.  With hard-headedness, of course, comes a responsibility: ... Well, I'm not sure what it is, exactly, but I know there's  something .  At any rate, this is where I'm going to put my hard-headedness on display for all the 'net to see! (Yeah, right, that's a bunch of BS--nobody reads this crap anyway.)  So, dare you wander into the deep, murky depths of my thoughts, and witness the shear madness that is my decision-making process?  Hell, even  I 've never witnessed  that , but still..  Well, you get the message.  - Your Insane Wannabe Normal Buddy

       Cutting his skin, a poet speaks with blood  ("Shinjitsu to Gensou to", L'Arc-En-Ciel)  I am a self-proclaimed poet.  The word poet, on the FictionPress.Com dictionary, is defined as  a writer of poems (the term is usually reserved for writers of good poetry) . I, as the author of my poetry (as well as any other type of piece that I do), have no right to judge my writing as good, but I use the term  poet  loosely. I have been writing poetry for two to four years (I've lost track of the times, I suppose), and although I follow no clear "form" in my poetry, I suppose I can say that I have had experience in the writing of it.

      ("Vampire Romance Part I", by Blut Engel)  This story was written a year or so ago, about a young British vampire and her new American friend who moved to London in 1983.   urlLink Vampyre Cat  is a light-hearted collection of tales about Katie and Jake and their nighttime adventures with the vampyres of the London area.  No, I know absolutely nothing about London or England, especially in 1983, but it wasn't meant to be taken so seriously.  It was just a few little stories to entertain the bored.

       It's the moon that leads the dance  ("Valse de la Lune", Ilaria Graziano; from the  Wolf's Rain  anime series)  Alright, my procrastinating on  urlLink Legend of The Blue Howler  is finally over, and it is now posted on FictionPress.Com.  I wrote LoTBH in 2002; it's the first long story I wrote, accumulating ten pages on Microsoft Word.  It's about a teen named Bastion Gunner of Gloresbrook, Pennsylvania, who becomes an extraordinarily unique werewolf.  Read it if you're interested.  My writing has improved greatly since 2002, as is evident in the maturity of my narrative in  Legend of The Blue Howler  versus my narrative in  The Journal of Brian Ezhno .  It's amazing how obvious improvement can be, after even only two years.   By the prickling of my thumbs Something wicked this way comes.

      ("The Gang's All Here", Dropkick Murphys)  Today I have posted the second major story I ever wrote.   urlLink Human Heart , the story of Allie Barton, is now on FictionPress.Com in 5-chapter increments.  I wrote it at the beginning of last year.  The idea came to me while I was watching a History channel special on gangs/the mafia before/during/after the Great Depression.  It was just an aimless idea based on S.E. Hinton's  The Outsiders , which I had read (and watched) before the History channel show.   Human Heart  is based in 1975 in the fictional town of Tolein, South Dakota.  I would appreciate if you read and reviewed or commented on it, either on FictionPress or on this Blog.

      ("No Time to Cry", Cradle of Filth)  I suppose, since I posted Black Rainbow Fantasy here, I ought to post my other opera as well.  Being that there are only two of them posted online, I now will introduce my second.   urlLink The Journal of Brian Ezhno  is the journal of someone near my heart.  It ranges from the first of August in 2001 to Halloween of that same year, chronicaling the worst stage of that which ailed him.  Read and you will understand.

      ("Subhuman", The Pillows)  If you're curious as to why the address of this blog is Bicker Rose, read through  urlLink Black Rainbow Fantasy .  It's mentioned in Part VII: Roses & Ogres, which is to date the last chapter in the series, but I'm afraid if you skip to VII you may get lost.  I don't know if that's true, but whatever.  And if you're  not  curious, go ahead and read through it anyway.  I could use some feedback.   By the prickling of my thumbs Something wicked this way comes. Is this girl a friend or foe?

      ("White Ash", The Pillows)  Go figure.  I posted, exited, and, lo and behold!, I forgot my screen name and couldn't sign in again.  I had to go back and look at the music I had been listening to at the time to remember what the hell I'd called myself.  Pretty damn stupid of me.  Everyone has their moments, even you.  Nobody's perfect.  Especially, God forbid, a writer such as I, whose respect rests solely on the written word.   By the prickling of my thumbs Something wicked this way comes.

      If anyone who happens upon this blog is as lyrically-oriented as I, you will know that this line comes from a song by The Pillows, called "Our Love and Peace".  I will probably name my posts after songs/song lines until I run out or can't think of one.  I know you all probably don't care, but that's okeydokey with me--not my damn problem.  I am a writer.  I write fiction.  Genre-bending, not-so-teenie-bopper fiction.  I write whatever the hell I want, including poetry, songs, horror/thrillers, and an epic fantasy tale that needs a few "Monster" Edits.  I have created my own language, my own worlds, and my own best friends.  I have a God-given knack for the art of "wordslinging", and by all the Gods it's fun as hell to use it on unsuspecting people.  I doubt any of the things I post in here will be real, because my "real life" is very boring.  Real life, in general, is very boring.  I don't intend to write anything about my life, especially my most personal things, but that's to be expected, I think.  It's the Internet, for God's sake.  Can you tell how old I am?  Oh, well, I don't really care whether you can or not.  It doesn't matter.  The world moves on and age will make no difference.  We all die in due time anyhow.  No mortal nor immortal, man nor woman, deity nor human, can strike dead the Gan of one with nothing else to live for.  But who would want to live forever?

      ("One to the Right", Lucky Boys Confusion)  I recently wrote a story called  urlLink What To Do With A Gun .  Yes, I know the title is kind of ripe, but it was a working title.  The idea for it was originally just a short one- or two-pager, but as you can see it evolved into an 18-page monster.  But from what I hear it's very good.  It's about Jake, whose life has basically fallen apart, who is locked in a small glass room with a handgun.  He has a choice to make, and recalls all of the events that have lead up to this point in order to make this decision.   By the prickling of my thumbs Something wicked this way comes.

      ("Come, Little Children" by Sarah Jessica Parker from the film    Hocus Pocus , 1993)  I wrote a new poem the other night, amazingly enough, called " urlLink The Piper ."  I wrote it late at night, and it came out in the tradition of  The Pied Piper of Hamlin .  Creeps me out a little.
