      Actually this story i can't share wif all of you..... but I think its time for me to throw them out from my memories... On 28th June 2004.... a guy name Muhammad Ariff..... came into my life...... that bring a brand new of ME!!! We frend for almost a month.... Actually we noe each other since last year hari raya.... he is one of my beloving uncle frend... We love each other very much.... Neither he or me will feel very lonely if we did not message or call each other.... our world felt like NOTHING!!  On 23th July 2004, we decided to wear the same shirt that is White.... but I did not tell him that i will be wearing white..... cause i tell him that i wanna wear black..... hahahz!! At night, we talk on the phone..... just can't wait for our first meet at East Coast Beach.... Because we are celebrating my uncle and my sis b'dae party.....  On 24th July 2004, the dae that we waited had arrived.... Early in the morning around 9am he message me by saying the word i will not forget 'Selamat Pagi Simah. Awak dah bangun Sayang.' its mean gd morning simah haf u awake darling..... that is the word that untill now still playing in my mind... At 1.15 pm..... my uncle..... arrived at my house..... because wanna take all the food for the pit.... I thought my uncle come wif his frend..... but i was wrong..... he came to my house too..... My uncle said "Sepasang putih nampak." that means i wear same white same as him.....but u all will noe wat i do....  At East Coast Beach..... this is where the memoriable story started..... We haf just arrived n we quickly set up the function..... My uncle asked ariff to take some water..... n he bring me along...... as we are walking suddenly he hold my hand..... such a romantice guy....... We share ice-cream together..... we drink in one cup..... we eat at one plate..... can't u see that is so romantice.....  There is also one memoriable place that we both write our name so that people noe who is the owner of that TREE!! At night we seat at that tree and he huge me so tightly n said the sweet word... " U always haf me and I always haf u".....  But now there's no more of me n ariff.... we haf just broke off like that..... now he haf a new gerl.... i now nothing to him...... for him i'm a bunch of SHIT!!! I REALLY HATE HIM!!! ARIFF
