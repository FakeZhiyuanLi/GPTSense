      I was one of those little girls who used to practice writing my first name paired with the last name of the cute boy who sat at the back of the class. I remember especially at the height of my crush on a guy, I would write it over and over in my notebook. Or if I liked more than one guy I would write my name with each of the their last names to see which one I preferred. But those days of pre-fem(inist) bliss are long gone and laughable given my passionately defiant views about relationship gender dynamics in this culture.  I am opposed to the patriarchal naming system that honors male heritage and identity and invalidates the female's. I am repulsed by the symbolic statment that the female perpetually belongs to the male- first her father then her husband.  I think the decision to take on your husband's name, hyphenate, or keep your own is an important and personal one. I don't judge anyone who has taken on her husband's name- the fem movement, afterall, advocates a woman's right to choose, whatever her choice.  But for me, I have nooooo plans WhatSoEver of dropping my last name. None. Zilch. Zip.  First of all, my family is the most essential aspect of my identity and my name ties me to them. My family is a very small, tight crew and I don't want us to ever be divided even in name. Further than that, I want to pass my family name on to my children and have them pass it on to their children. My family is a strong, courageous female group whose legacy I want to see carried on in name and story.  It's also important to me because of the particular dynamics of the relationship that I'm in. My partner and I are from two completely different cultures, and where I have a stronger connection to my cultural roots, he comes from a much bigger family. One side of his family alone is 10 times the size of my family. So, as much as I hate to admit it, there is somewhat of an issue of cultural threat.  I come from a small Jamaican family (my mother, father, and older sister immigrated, my younger sister and I were born here). My culture is a fundamental feature of my identity, second only to my family and it's very important to me that the future generations of my family maintain a connection to their Caribbean heritage. Growing up, my culture richly colored my environment: Jamaican neighborhoods, Jamaican churches, Jamaican family friends, Jamaican food, Jamaican music, Jamaican cultural values, and best of all frequent visits to our family in Jamaica. I LOVE Jamaica, the land and the legacy. My heart takes a leap just talking about it.  I have American friends, however, who don't know what their family's country of origin was (I'm speaking of those whose ancestors were  voluntary  immigrants). They're fine with it, and that's good for them, but for me the thought of my children's children being detached from the our culture is unbearable. Our culture is just too precious to me.  My boyfriend's family is Italian American, and incidentally so is my boyfriend. They are several generations removed from the original immigrants in their family, but their Italian heritage is largely present.  I think it's beautiful that my children will enjoy two rich cultural heritages. My boyfriend and I are already planning ways to give our children a strong sense of identity to both cultures, including trips to Jamaica and Italy- and I don't mean the tourist spots. Well maybe in Italy, but I've never even been to the tourist area of Jamaica and I'm not even curious about it. I know that it's not the Jamaica I know. I think of it as Jamaica on stage performing for a foreign audience, but the parts of Jamaica I go to are the true heart and soul of the island, it's the raw and beautiful existence behind the curtain.  I hope we can make similar connections in Italy as well. I've always adored the culture.  While I am optimistic about bringing the cultures together, for our children, I worry about how easily their Jamaican identity can be overwhelmed by their Italian one. Although I don't have an indentifiably Jamaican name (bcuz no such name exists- well, maybe Marley), my boyfriend has an unmistakably Italian one. Between an Italian last name, and a large Italian family, I might as well ship my kids off to Italy and call it a day. I want my family to have as much prominence in their lives, their daily lives, as their Italian family, and having them claim my family name is an important way to maintain that balance.  So I've made the case for keeping my last name, but there are some problems with that as well. First, we're going to have to take a lot of slack for that, from society as well as our more tradiational loved ones. As if being an interracial couple isn't trouble enough (with regard to others, not us), do I really want to pick up another battle?  Second, and perhaps most importantly, that little girl who used to doodle her notebook pages away?...She's still in there..... And I can't help it, there's something I find truly and utterly romantic and loving about sharing a last name with your partner. It's just..why can't it be mine??? In our case, I know the answers to that. First, he also has strong emotional and cultural connections to his family name. Also as an artist, name recognition is important to his trade. His name is beautiful, too, from the first, middle to last, it's perfect and I could never ask him to alter it. But as tempting as it feels from time to time, I can't alter mine either, for reasons that are equally compelling.  Oh, darn the feminist movement for waking us up to our rights and choices.

      The other day I was at the doctor's- well technically the nurse practioner's- for a routine medical visit otherwise known as the bane of womankind. As she was doing her job, she was spoke to me about about various things health, tips, other stuff. Then in the middle of her sentence she stopped, looked me in the face and said "Are you even listening to me?"  I was so caught off guard by the question that I'm not even sure what the answer was that I managed to fumble out. I felt that brief streak of alarm that one feels when one is called out, but more alarming as the question it spurred "It it possible that all this time, people could tell what I was thinking when they were talking?"  I already know that I am notoriously bad at deceit, and recently I went in for an acting audition that I worked really hard at and didn't even make it past the first round. I am a naturally honest person and it is the virtue I place the highest value on in myself and those close to me. So, I am uncomfortable with lying, and even I weren't I'd be screwed because my baby face is like a mircoscope into my soul. It just lays my feelings bare for the world, without my permission or awareness. I hate that. But I do like my face though.  But anyway, despite the fact that I am unable to actively lie - like saying something is false when it's true- I did think I could at least pull of the social niceties, the "deceit," that is necessary for our daily interactions. Smiling at people when you're in a sucky mood. Behaving as if you're happy to see someone when you really just couldn't find a place to hide from them quickly enough. Looking interested in a longwinded individual's third story in a row when you're really using the time to devise an escape plan.  Being able to conceal one's true feelings in these cases is not only not wrong, but is a fundamental social skill. So now I am wondering whether that nurse is unusually keen, or whether I've got to brush on my acting skills--for the stage life.

      In the middle of a sleepless night, my thoughts are with my family:  Family is such a beautiful thing.  When my family gathers together We three are as one soul Our hearts beat as one heart They are my life I am their life Our lives are one  When my family gathers together Our family spirit is palpable It feels like a precious gemstone Heavy and Beautiful Rough and Radiant Rare and Invaluable  Mommy, your eyes are like diamonds That reflect and radiate A Spirit of Light A Warm and Enduring heart A Reflective and Resourceful mind A Wise and Purposeful soul  Sister, your eyes are like honey-colored rubies They are Sweet and Lovely Genuine and Endearing Ambitious and Hopeful Inquisitive and Witty  My family, it hasn’t been easy on us, has it? But we’re pulling through together My family, life has presented us a long dark maze But we’re working it out together My family, sometimes it feels unbearable, doesn’t it? But it’s not when we’re together

      It’s happened again. They’ve othered another innocent “brotha”. Another television show whose script I wrote myself into, whose storylines I read my life into and whose character’s worlds I’ve thrown myself into has casted me and others like me out. We've been casted out of their world, and out of their norm. We just got “othered”.  It started, oddly enough, when I was a naive pre-teen fan of the Golden Girls (get over it, you know I wasn’t the only one). For years I watched that show, got to know and enjoy the characters, sang along with the theme song, rooted for Dorothy, thought Sophia would be a cool grandmother. Then one day they had the “Black” episode. Dorothy’s son brought home significant other who happened to be Black and Black became the subject of the entire episode. They threw the issue of age into the mix (the woman was significantly older), but that, in my either cynical or shrewd opinion, was just to give the golden girls a reason to dislike the differences between the partners that didn’t make them look racist. The audience is asked to believe that the golden girls aren’t racist, they just thought this couple was too…. “different”. However race is an ongoing theme in the episode that is openly named and addressed by the black woman's family and would have been the elephant in the room on the golden girls' side were it not for Rose. Rose, because of her character's perceived innocence and naivete, was the golden girl who the producers used to talk about race and when she did, the question she asked of the black woman's family was telling: "What color is your dandruff?" I was going to repeat Rose’s question here for emphasis on the absurdity of it, but I don’t want to get too worked up right now. I’m only on the first show. The first show where Black people were portrayed and responded to as being essentially different from the main characters who happened to be white.  Besides being utterly unentertained, I remember as a little girl feeling this indescribable combination of sadness, anger, pain, vulnerability, and even shame. It was the first time on present day TV that I had seen "blackness" causing so much commotion and being a point of such strong focus and reaction. I remember feeling like there was a hot spotlight on my racial features and it was singeing my skin. I remember realizing that if I were ever to walk on as a character on that show, I wouldn’t be their friendly child neighbor Ann Marie. I’d be the black girl, from that black family that just moved in across the street. They would not be asking me about school, hobbies, and boys, but about the color dandruff that my people have. I wouldn’t be the boring plain Jane character that I actually am in real life, I would be a “black character”, because being black is such a different phenomenon of an experience, that when a black person enters a mainstream show, their blackness must be pointed out, magnified, and put on for show. It seems to be the primary aspect of their identity that is responded to, and supersedes any other part of their identity that could actually tell you something about them.  Then as I got older and hipper I moved on to the more hip territory of 90210. Somehow I don’t think you’re thinking of me as hipper, but I don’t care I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED that show. I had a crush on each of the guys in the show at some point in time, except for Steve, and I loved and hated all of the girls at some point in time. But just as I was trying to decide between Dylan and Brandon, and started thinking Brenda was cooler than Kelly, it happened again. An Other episode. For 90210s first Black episode they showed a rivalry between two schools, which because of the racial makeup of the each school (one predominantly white, the other black) , and the fact that the show had narrow minded producers and writers, the rivalry turned into one between races. In the end the episode tried to relay a message about racial harmony so I let it slide.  But then I started noticing that every time a black character came on the scene in 90210, their race became the focal point of the story. And of course the main characters become the defenders and rescuers of the black people. Brandon has a fling with a Black girl in Texas, she becomes the target of racism, and Brandon defends her. Donna has a Black boyfriend who her family hates- why? Because he’s a jerk? Because he beats her? Because he’s a playboy? No, no, noooooo, First of all none of that is true of this character, and second, personality isn’t a factor when dealing with black characters on 90210. His personality is not important or even developed on the show. The most important information that we and Donna’s family have about him is that he is black. Of course Donna, being the race crusader that she is, defends him and saves the day. There were other episodes, but the same storyline- black character guests on the show, black character pointed out and responded to based on their race.  Bringing us on into the present, I recently fell in love with and have become addicted what I think is one of the best shows of all time (then again, 10 years ago I would have said that about 90210) , a show I cannot afford to watch on TV, so I rent on DVD. It’s the incomparable Sex and the City, an intelligent and sophisticated dramady about four 30- somethings exploring love, life, and identity in NYC. The characters are each so unique, yet there are traits in each of them that one can find relatable. I’ve identified with each of the characters at various points. After more than a few late nights watching episode after episode, I felt like I knew them so well that I could just walk up to them in the coffee shop and join in the conversation seamlessly.  But just when I thought it was safe to watch mainstream TV in the millennium, it happened. This morning before I went to work I watched the sixth season episode where Miranda starts flirting with a new neighbor. This neighbor happens to be black, and is the first time in the history of a show, which is based in one of the most racially diverse cities in the world, that a black character is seriously introduced.  When I saw him my radar went up, and as much as I wanted to suppress it and just enjoy the episode, the questions begged to be asked “Are we there yet? Are we finally at that point where every man is a man, or do we still feel the need to subcategorize, scandalize, and otherize men (or women) who are not white? Will this character be treated as a man…..or a Black man?”  My first hunch towards the answer came when Miranda and her new male friend, Robert, are watching a show about an interracial relationship that mirrored theirs (black male, white female). In listening to the tv characters’ dialogue, Robert realizes that the couple is British, to which Robert- an upperclass doctor who works for the Knicks- replies “Gotta luv a brutha with an accent…”  In case you didn’t notice he was black, folks.  I rewound and replayed the line, holding on to hope that my burning ears were wrong and that a show that is otherwise ahead of its time was above this. But it was a no-go. The brotha was othered.  Other viewers may have missed that subtlely, and lest the writers risk that chance they made certain to unreserverdly other him for the rest of the show. Throughout the remainder of the show he was referred to as “a handsome black man”, “black boyfriend”, “black doctor”.  This is sooo 40 years ago that I don’t even know what to say that shouldn’t already be blatantly obvious. Color of skin vs. content of character? It’s all been said before. I am proud of being black, and I am proud of black people, in all the many colors and cultures from whence they come, and my criticism s not about erasing blackness-whatever that means. What I do want to erase is the racism that makes a physical feature as useless as race so prime that we use it to judge, categorize, and divide ourselves from others. I want to erase the racism the normalizes one racial group in mainstream TV, but otherizes all other people such that race is the primary trait that is used to describe and understand the non-white character. It is divisive, stigmatizing, misleading, useless, and unnecessary.
