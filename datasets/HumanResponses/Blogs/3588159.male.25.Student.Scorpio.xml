       This mythic classic makes the list for reason # 1, namely that it should be a bestseller. Wangerin is a real  storyteller , and not in the dubious* sense of the word (as misused on the backs of cheap fantasy novels). His narrative is compelling without being contrived. His dialogue is beautifully crafted. The characters hold you captive for 200+ pages and it’s hard to fight your way out. Simple enough for children, profound enough for adults, this book ranks with the likes of  Watership Down  and  Animal Farm  and compares favorably to the hallowed  Chronicles of Narnia . As you’ve probably guessed,  Dun Cow  is a book about animals. And no, the title is not terribly compelling. (A factor in the book’s relative anonymity?) But read it. I laughed, I cried, I bought it, I read it semi-annually, I give it away to my friends… and you will too.   This word was used in association with   urlLink  The Vocabulary Reclamation Project.     *Dubious. An elegant way to say something is of questionable character. A claim that's ambiguous, evasive, or flat-out dishonest. Synonyms are: doubtful, fishy, shady, suspect, suspicious.

       It doesn’t sound like a blockbuster (and it doesn’t read like a screen play), but what a breath of fresh air. Originally published in French, this book is a psychological masterpiece, and classic enough to survive translation. It brought to mind the flavor of Dostoevsky’s  Brothers Karamozov , or the lucid, disarming self-awareness of Montaigne…but published originally in 1937. In the words of  The New York Times Book Review , “It is a strange and sad, yet a beautiful and compelling story.” Bittersweet indeed. A modern masterpiece. (And I’m not Catholic.) If you do consider reading this book, which you should, keep in mind that it’s one of those   urlLink  Books Not Everyone Is Smart Enough To Read   , both for its inadequate recognition and somewhat challenging dialogue. (There are some passages you’ll need to read twice.) So prepare accordingly.       - Originally posted on   urlLink  BitterSweetLife   .

       A book is placed on this exclusive list  only  by meeting one or both of the following criteria:  1. The book is not widely read, but, due to its overall quality, should be.  2. The books makes higher demands on the reader than usual, via concepts or language, with proportionate re  wards.      You will probably note that books make this list only after I become  personally  acquainted with them. That's right, this is one of those exclusive clubs when a big title isn't enough to get you in. But if you have a book in mind that absolutely, positively  has  to be on this list... urlLink send me a note ...and I'll add your prodigy to my  Reading List.  Fair enough?          Good reading is like looking for something you have lost and finding it, but in the search finding something else that also had been lost. - Ravi Zacharias,  Recapture the Wonder        The Current List

        I just finished reading Nehemiah, a truly mythic book (in the Bible) with great evocations. And it's also historically accurate. (Can you beat that?) I came up with this "rag" (as in a rough shred) poem thinking about N's faith-driven persistence. Maybe it's more of a song lyric, really.     The strength of the builders is failing, There are no stories told at all. Hearts misplaced in piles of rubble, I wonder who will build the wall.  The men are praying to their weapons, There is no singing anymore. Hope is locked inside the temple, Faith scorched like the city doors.  The square is filled with propaganda, Flyers and letters by the ton. Every morning a new mantra, But we’ll have truth when work is done.   © 2004 Ariel Vanderhorst

      It's late when I get back to my apartment and I fumble with my keys before I manage to open my door.     "There's going to be a storm," is the first thing I hear.    The voice, somehow both hard and wavering, comes from the darkness of my living area. I know the speaker immediately, though I can not see him. Caudil. He's been smoking, and the heavy smell of herbs is everywhere.   I hit the switch on the wall and hear the whoosh of gas and steam flowing through the pipes behind my walls. A moment later, the lights kick on, and I see Caudil sitting in my father's leather chair.     "That's my favorite chair, Caudil."    I set my bag down, and step into the kitchen to get a drink.      "Did you hear what I said about the storm?"   "Did you hear what I said about the chair? It's going to take me a week to get the smell of whatever it is you're smoking out of the house, let alone the leather"   I hear him get up and walk into the kitchen. He's holding the pipe up like a teacher might hold a model of the heart, ready to explain.    "It's valerian root, Reg. It'll be gone tomorrow," he says as he rounds the corner.    There's a touch of irritation in his voice, and for the first time I see his eyes. They are red-rimmed and heavy and he looks much older than I have ever seen him.       "Tell me about the storm," I say.      Caudil opens his mouth to speak severa l times before actually beginning. I wonder when he has last slept. When he does speak, his voice quavers, and though it is quite deep and the lines in his face and the heaviness of his eyes suggest otherwise, he seems less like a man telling a tale and more a child recounting some terror in the night.       crossposted to my  urlLink personal blog  story idea from the  urlLink alt.fiction.orginal  August Challenge

         This one's just for fun because it's late.    I drink milk and honey in my coffee; it’s my taste of the promised land. Keeps my bleary eyes open to see–- maybe there are still springs in the sand.  So the cream and gold amid the black keep my eyes open to behold a pillar of flame, iridescent cloud at my back and a watered garden from a mountain peak...before I get too old.  Still there are answers my imbibed alacrity can’t find–- Does my pathway end at this scenic mountain wall? Or does it crest the proffered overlook and fall? Will I ever enter Canaan…before I lose my body, soul and mind?    © 2004 Ariel Vanderhorst

        v. 5.0...the last, we all hope.         Alex and Sarah had heard the rumors. His relatives were always making allusions, as vague as they were dark, about his parents and The House. However, the insinuations always stopped short of naming the supposed wickedness. And, Just jealous old people, Alex would shrug. The estate snapshots were what stopped him short, captivated him. When he looked at the pictures, he couldn’t help himself. This is the place they say is tainted? Haunted by grandeur, maybe. And then the deeds of property had been unearthed.  Alex and Sarah had never expected their lives to be perfect. So it was a surprise when the day arrived, and they found themselves waking up in a house built solely for delight. A fire-tipped sunrise flew in the window, and the nagging questions about propriety and their rights of inheritance faded like night mists. It was morning, the first morning, and they were finally there, in a mansion that seemed too Edenic to exist.  There, in the house, (Alex was fond of saying) was everything they could possibly need to be happy. Sarah had been wooed quickly by his eagerness. Now they had taken full ownership, and with expectations soaring, one felt so young! Subsequent days and weeks could only serve to reveal all the ingenious amenities so admired when Alex’s  parents possessed the place.  The residence had been designed for Alex’s parents, and built on a grand scale, with details and flourishes so unique, and yet so fitting and well-conceived, that one could simply enjoy—savor—the place without comprehending the genius beneath each beam and buttress. It was a mysterious work of art. It was a DaVinci or a Michelangelo, the flawless concept hidden by the mesmerizing edifice. It had been like a palace.  There were nooks built into wood-paneled walls overlooking scenic gardens, while a half-turn brought you to blazing hearth and open rafters. There were rooms with windows set so as to catch every ray of the sun, all day, from its rising to its setting.  In places you could be just a step from a crowded sitting room and yet feel utterly private and alone. Another room would feel bustling and festive with a party of just two or three. There were vistas and alcoves to suit every mood and temperament.  Strangely, no one knew the builder’s name, or he would surely have been called back, his work praised, his pockets filled, his mind uncorked and reverently tasted like a wine of rarest vintage. Apparently, his name had died with Alex’s parents. If only someone knew him.  For Alex and Sarah, this desire grew especially pronounced. Alex made inquiries. Then he took out a notice in the paper. The tone of his investigation moved from expectant to baffled to perturbed. In contrast, Sarah fretted after their house’s builder wistfully, longing for his reappearance; she found her mind forming mute petitions. But all to no avail. And their need for the man had become urgent. All was not right with the house. Almost imperceptibly, the imposing creation was growing somewhat the worse for wear.  The house was rambling to begin with, and, as Sarah’s favorite proviso ran, In a place so big it would be virtually impossible to keep everything in perfect order after so many years. It was a good explanation, and they needed one, because, as it turned out, everything was not in perfect order. Somehow, the house was not the model of perfection it had been when first formed.  Their homeowner’s nightmare had begun unremarkably. Gradually, they had become aware of nagging incongruities: the sunshine did not fit the angles of their windows anymore, and Alex struggled to rest comfortably in a bed and chairs that were just inches too small. He did not recall his parents being unusually short. Had the wood shrunk? Had the walls sunk?  Other, darker misfortunes followed. A warped floorboard threw Sarah on her face. Alex stumbled and fell down a flight of stairs when a banister came loose from the wall. Moreover, time passed strangely in the house, sometimes slowly, sometimes with great rapidity. But the moments that crawled were filled with tedium or darkness, and the happy, day-lit moments were fleeting. Mornings and afternoons fled like butterflies but nights stretched on interminably. There was never enough daylight.  Alex’s unrest, now shared by Sarah, was stoked by a growing irritability and flashes of anger that marred his outlook. He would grow frustrated over a loose doorknob or stair, and then bring himself to a flaming rage because he had become frustrated in the first place.  “Who has broken our house?” he would shout, swearing. “And, damn him, where is the builder? I’d like to kill the builder!” Sarah could never fathom why Alex came around to hating someone he had never met.  “The plans must be flawed,” she would reply, reassuring. “There’s no way we could have known.” Inwardly, though, she began to wonder, Why can’t things just be like they were before?  About this time, Alex and Sarah, each took it as a personal burden to examine the house, thoroughly, from top to bottom. Strangely, it was as if the search was one they could not share, could not pursue together. Silent and separate, they immersed themselves in the twisting rooms of the mansion, looking for the tangible source of the disintegration around them.  Sarah’s search led her gradually upwards, scouring each floor of the mansion as she made her way toward the house’s roof. There were some rooms that she did not enter, so ominous and heavy was the air in them. To her horror, she encountered odors of decay; wood crumbled under her feet and once a stair gave way and she narrowly missed plummeting through the floor. “How could this place have fallen so far?” she asked aloud. Then she sat down on the top step and began to cry. “How have we fallen so far? We were so happy at first. We would laugh all day. What has happened to us?” Sarah could not stop weeping. Just then a single ray of sunlight pierced an invisible crack, shining on the wall. Sarah sighed. She stood and climbed slowly upward.   Alex wandered downward. Threading a snarl of passages, he entered a sprawling basement; a bare light bulb hid more than it revealed, and all he could see was the oblong stone that marked his parents grave. He traced the damp inscription…remembered their faces, keen with intelligence, and the bitter accusations laid at their feet over the estate. Meditatively, he kneeled at their grave.  “Bought with blood,” the relatives had said. “We all know how that house was paid off. And things changed after that.” But it was so perfect, thought Alex. He stood over the grave, his thoughts conflicted. If his parents were guilty of evil…what had they done? He brushed grime from the gravestone. Read his parents’ names. And then he saw the second tomb. Shadowed by the wall was a long, low mound. What? His eyes narrowed. Then he began to dig.  Sarah stood on a rooftop. Sun made her eyes smart, wind threw her hair wildly, and she saw, across the valley, what must be, had to be, an illusion—but was not. Another house, lofty, graceful…and so strangely familiar. And standing by the gateway, who was that? Was he waving? Walking closer? She threw her hands up and screamed giddily: “HELLO! HELLOO!” Then she flew down the stairs.             Sarah could not remember the last time she had felt so lighthearted. Holding her skirt in one hand, clinging to banisters, dancing past decaying floorboards, she felt herself smiling. Alex has to know!  Alex had reached the bottom of a very shallow grave. Beneath a sheen of dust lay a few scraps of tattered cloth…rusted metal shards…and nothing else. He leaned back on his haunches, grimacing. There should be more…but the ground was damp, rats lived in the basement…and how much more proof did he need? True then, those surviving echoes: “After the falling out, the builder disappeared…” He kicked at the loose soil and stood. Bitterness flooded his mouth and head. Those, my parents. This, my inheritance! Their blood, their house, now mine. Well…  Alex shrugged. I have always been one to keep what is mine. He laughed, a tinny sound in the cellar vault. And look at this place! The man got what he deserved. He turned, took a swift step. Then another; the door clattered behind him. The light bulb flickered, then bathed the grave in black.  A short time later, Sarah found Alex in the kitchen, a fire lit. The smoke, not escaping through the chimney, was eddying in the room, and it was uncomfortably hot.  “Alex,” said Sarah. “I climbed to the roof! I went outside, and stood on the parapet, and I could see another house across the valley—beautiful; the sun turned it gold. Like this house, and yet…not. I knew we had neighbors, but I’d never seen the place before.” Alex turned, frowning, but said nothing.  “And there’s more. Alex, I know the problem with our house!”  “No,” said Alex softly.  “Alex, the house’s plans are not flawed. Oh, no!” Sarah laughed, but Alex’s face darkened.  “Nothing wrong with the blueprints, Alex. Our problem is more serious than that. Our problem is that—”  “NO!” said Alex suddenly and too loud. Sarah paused, her face clouding.  “Enough, Sarah. If you see the place as flawed, that is your own fault.” Sarah sunk onto a chair, her head drooping, and Alex turned back to the fire. But Sarah’s body straightened.  “Alex,” she said. “We live in the wrong house.”   “No, No, NO!” cried Alex. “This place is my inheritance and it’s our house. OURS.” He had been sharpening a kitchen knife, evidently succeeding too well, for one of his palms was bleeding. “We’ll never leave.”  “Alex, you don’t understand. I saw a man, I think he may be the—”  “Listen—be quiet! I need silence. I need to think. I don’t need your theories, Sarah! Who are you to judge?”  There was a short silence, punctuated by Sarah’s beating heart. Then: “No,” she said steadily. “We need to move across the valley. This is the wrong house.”  Smoke was filling the room. Sarah bent over the fireplace, tinkering with the chimney valve, and as she did so, Alex grasped the newly-whetted carving knife. “My parents did no wrong,” he muttered. Blade ready, he crouched on the balls of his feet. Sarah tinkered. Soot rained down. Then the room sighed audibly, as smoke began to drift upward, and simultaneously two things happened.  Alex took a step forward, swift and silent.  And the doorbell rang.    © 2004 Ariel Vanderhorst

      To all you prophets out there: If all you have is your nice stories-–dreams, artistic impressions, whatever, share those. You won’t be condemned for sharing your personal reflections.  But if anyone has actually heard from God, remember that His word has the harvest potency of ripe grain, able to multiply for a hundred-fold yield, unlike the flimsy straw of your rhetoric that is likely to be blown away in the first breeze of logic and a few days of sleep, or burned instantaneously by the heat of intelligent opposition.  Keep in mind that His word has the explosive ability of a roaring fire, able to purify and refine the toughest hearts and minds and consume any heresy or selfish lie.  Keep in mind that His word has the startling demolition capacity of a heavy sledge, able to split the earth or a soul and shatter rock or pride, so that water or brokenness can flow out, resulting in refreshment and healing.  Again, if it’s all you’ve got, people like a cute story now and then. But if you’ve heard from God, then you really have something. So you might want to go with that.   (Based on Jeremiah 23:28-29)

       urlLink      A favorite, especially in adjective form.       I have this lingering fear that fascinating and clever words are disappearing from our vocabularies. Many of our speech patterns could be best summarized as  like, um, whatever  and our society seems to dumb everything down to the lowest common denominator. This process is exemplified by rap music, where every third word would appear like **** on this blog, and the main theme of every album is as follows:   I’m the man Because I talk trash And pull triggers And get girls pregnant I’m the man   The problem with simplistic, repetitive language is that it can only express one type of idea—you know, the simplistic, repetitive kind. Which is cool…if you’re operating a jack hammer or jogging…for the rest of the foreseeable future.    But more complex—and more valuable—ideas deserve more complex language. In fact, they require it. Example: It’s not possible to express the concept of “beauty” (even allowing for different interpretations) using only the words found in the lyrics of a 50 Cent album.        For us to live and die properly, things have to be named properly. Let us reclaim our words. - John Berger     So. Really engaging dialogue and writing must not be allowed to go the way of the dinosaur. And while others are doing their part (  urlLink WORLD  ,   urlLink Credenda Agenda  ,  The Wall Street Journal , great authors…), this ought to be a grassroots effort as well. And to this end I am launching the  Vocabulary Reclamation Project (VRP) , a movement intent on getting the power of words back into the mouths of the people.  As founder and sole member of the VRP (so far), I will be searching for ways to subversively insert  piquant  and  mesmeric  words into my posts. (Ok, so that sentence was a bit of an overkill.) But if you occasionally see a truly scintillating (or somewhat obscure) word on my blogs, marked by an asterisk, you can breath a sigh of relief, and, if necessary, check the definition. The  VRP  is on the job.  (Care to  urlLink join the inner circle ?)

       I just finished reading  Nehemiah , a truly mythic book in the Bible. It's also historically accurate. (Can you beat that?) I came up with this "rag" (as in  a rough shred ) poem thinking about Nehemiah’s faith-driven persistence.  Nehemiah’s quest to rebuild Jerusalem’s walls and return the hearts of his people to their God was a brilliant success…and a heartrending failure. He poured himself into Jerusalem and her people for over a decade. Then, after mere years of absence, he returned to discover worship abandoned, festivals forgotten, lawbreaking embraced. Again, he called Jerusalem to repentance. Summoned Israel back to freedom and joy, their rich identity as “the chosen.” But how long would it last? That question could not have been kept back from entering his mind. Nonetheless, Nehemiah rebuilt. He didn't question his reward because he knew God was keeping track, not his people. So Nehemiah didn’t lean back on the crutch of a doubtful future, a stubborn race, and bow out. He built, and that was enough. He saw glory through rock dust. If that’s not bittersweet, what is?     The Poem    The strength of the builders is failing, There are no stories told at all. Hearts misplaced in piles of rubble, I wonder who will build the wall.  The men are praying to their weapons, There is no singing anymore. Hope is locked inside the temple, Faith scorched like the city doors.  The square is filled with propaganda, Flyers and letters by the ton, Every morning a new mantra. But we’ll have truth when work is done.   ©2004 Ariel Vanderhorst

        ...Here's How I Would Explain My Blog       You will have noticed this is an old-school blog, still bound by outmoded conventions like spelling, punctuation, capitalization, etc. This is, of course, a rather intolerant, absolutist way of looking at things. It implies that there are rules, and that those who don’t abide by them are somehow in error. Or even  wrong . Perhaps you wonder how I can be so sure of myself, so convinced that my way is the best. Or maybe you just hate me for my grammatical, syntactical arrogance. In such cases, I do have one thing to say:  It sure feels good being right.

       urlLink      Keeping the future in view, I guess.     Today I saw a caterpillar drop out of a tree onto an asphalt driveway. It was the sad little plop of his body hitting the pavement that got my attention.  Ouch.  Dreaming about butterflies again, little fellow?      He just lay there, stunned. Didn't move at all. After about a minute I felt compelled to help the poor guy. As soon as I touched him, he started writhing, kicking his miniscule legs in defiance of the rescue attempt. I tossed him onto the lawn against his will.  Good grief.  Where did the little jerk pick up his approach to an offer of help? Us humans?

       Certain things cause me to feel a combination of pity and revulsion. Sometimes an ugly building or overgrown yard, sometimes a pathetic book I would never want to read. O think,  oh ...that's sad. There's a unexplainable sensation that such things shouldn't exist. They're awkward.       But the remarkable thing is that such "aethetics" of life even bother me, considering the societal fragmentation and crying needs all around. Why should "mere" matters of appearance even register?       May I suggest that it's a testimony to the fact that that Christ gave us not just a moral compass but an  aesthetic sensibility  as well... a sensibility that's meant to lead somewhere. He means us to enjoy creation, and know the good and beautiful when we see it. And (same as in the realm of truth and ethics) therefore the inverse is also true.

       urlLink      The fateful evening .    Last Wednesday (August 4), Lindsay and I celebrated our third wedding anniversary. What I’ve heard is that the first three years are the hardest, so apparently we dodged the bullet, and now have a chance at the ripe old married age of “four.” On the auspicious evening we went to an Italian place we’d been eyeing for the past year—it was great. We exchanged gifts—mine went over well. (So did Lindsay’s, but that goes almost without saying; it doesn't take much to make me happy.)       Among our gifts were several poems. I wrote two short ones for Lindsay, and, true romantic that she is, she wept over the “sweet” one. The second poem was intended to be merely humorous, and she laughed, so I think the evening could be considered a success. Lindsay wrote some verse too, a deep, thoughtful poem for me, and, callous lout* that I am, I was still moved. I’d post the poems here for you, but Lindsay now owns the copyrights on mine, so I’d have to acquire permission; and her poem is too profound for casual browsing. All in all, a triumphant Third Anniversary evening.     I also wanted to briefly mention a book I finished last week:  The Diary of a Country Priest , by George Bernanos. It doesn’t sound like a blockbuster (and it doesn’t read like a screen play), but what a breath of fresh air. Originally published in French, this book is a psychological masterpiece, and classic enough to survive translation. It brought to mind the flavor of Dostoevsky’s  Brothers Karamozov , or the lucid, disarming self-awareness of Montaigne…but published originally in 1937. In the words of  The New York Times Book Review , “It is a strange and sad, yet a beautiful and compelling story.”  Bittersweet  indeed. A modern masterpiece. (And I’m not Catholic.) If you do consider reading this book, which you should, keep in mind that it’s one of those  urlLink Books Not Everyone Is Smart Enough To Read , both for its inadequate recognition and somewhat challenging dialogue. (There are some passages you’ll need to read twice.) So prepare accordingly.       *This word was used in association with the  urlLink  Vocabulary Reclamation Project .       Lout . I'm unsure of the word's etymology, but it seems to have an olde English flavor to it: "A lout's what ye are, Aelfric, and there's no mistakin' it." Synonyms include "thug," "hoodlum" and "oaf."

       urlLink      © 2004 Arielinds Photo      A bittersweet poem based on a couple stories we should all know.      I drink milk and honey in my coffee; it’s my taste of the promised land. Keeps my bleary eyes open to see–- maybe there are  still  springs in the sand.  So the cream and gold amid the black keep my eyes open to behold a pillar of flame, iridescent cloud at my back and a watered garden from a mountain peak...before I get too old.  Still there are answers my imbibed alacrity can’t find–- Does my pathway end at this scenic mountain wall? Or does it crest the proffered overlook and fall? Will I ever enter Canaan…before I lose my body, soul and mind?

       urlLink      A favorite, especially in adjective form.       I have this lingering fear that fascinating and clever words are disappearing from our vocabularies. Many of our speech patterns could be best summarized as  like, um, whatever  and our society seems to dumb everything down to the lowest common denominator. This process is exemplified by rap music, where every third word would appear like **** on this blog, and the main theme of every album is as follows:   I’m the man Because I talk trash And pull triggers And get girls pregnant I’m the man   The problem with simplistic, repetitive language is that it can only express one type of idea—you know, the simplistic, repetitive kind. Which is cool…if you’re operating a jack hammer or jogging…for the rest of the foreseeable future.    But more complex—and more valuable—ideas deserve more complex language. In fact, they require it. Example: It’s not possible to express the concept of “beauty” (even allowing for different interpretations) using only the words found in the lyrics of a 50 Cent album.       For us to live and die properly, things have to be named properly. Let us reclaim our words. - John Berger     So. Really engaging dialogue and writing must not be allowed to go the way of the dinosaur. And while others are doing their part (  urlLink WORLD  ,   urlLink Credenda Agenda  ,  The Wall Street Journal , great authors…), this ought to be a grassroots effort as well. And to this end I am launching the  Vocabulary Reclamation Project (VRP) , a movement intent on getting the power of words back into the mouths of the people.  If you occasionally see a truly scintillating (or somewhat obscure) word on the blog, marked by an asterisk, you can breath a sigh of relief, and, if necessary, check the definition. The  VRP  is on the job.  (Care to join the inner circle?)

          Lately I’ve been enjoying the sweet luxury of hoops on a regular basis. Once, sometimes twice a week, Lindsay turns me loose and I cruise down to the local metro university, UMKC. Adrenalin flowing, spirits ridiculously high, I play pickup basketball until my hoops-lovin’ heart can’t take any more.  Aah . Basketball is one of God’s better creations.  But far be it from me to head into the fieldhouse and forget the blog. In the course of my recent hoops trips, I’ve come across a strange (to me) phenomenon, one worth mentioning: someone who dislikes me for no apparent reason.  I don’t want to come off as an egotist. So let me say that there various people who have disliked me for  discernable  reasons. Nothing worth commenting on there. But someone who doesn’t even know you, and still gives you the cold shoulder? Surely, this bears looking into.  Let’s call him “John.” He’s about my size and height, and roughly twenty years my senior, judging by his hairline. Our games our similar, but not identical. If John gets a pick, and you might as well count ‘em. He’s deadly. Outside the arc or in, no difference. (Wish I could say the same.) His offense is an unconventional set shot (mine is textbook, a source of some pride), but that seems besides the point(s). John’s a crafty, sinewy, middle-aged marksman.  And he hates me.  It’s not as if I’m hard to work with on the court. I’m quick to distribute the ball, I call my own fouls, and I don’t talk any more trash than the situation warrants. Aside from those admirable traits, all I do is hit 90% of my jumpers ( inside  the arc, *sigh*). What’s not to like?  When it comes down to it, John hates me because I have a pull-up J, grab more than my share of rebounds, and I’m not jaded. (“Hate” is a little extreme, but allow me the effect, will you? Thanks.) That’s my theory, anyway, until I come up with a better one. There’s an indisputably cynical quality to John’s persona… (Once burned in love, now, never,  never  to be burned again…at least not in basketball?  Sure .)  How else to explain the lowered shoulders, cold demeanor and shouting:  Block out! Cut! That man’s mine, mine, mine!  What’s fueling this choleric competitor? You’re a complex man, John, but I have your little game figured out. I guess. (Once, long ago, somebody broke your heart…or something.)  To draw a wider parallel, it’s weird how people can end up disliking you for the very things you would hope to be admired for. Or is that just life? Either way, until I get this figured out, I’ll keep a wary eye on John’s elbows.    Anyone else have thoughts on this phenomenon?

       urlLink      The area of the rugged and barren Plaza zone known as "the horse fountain."      Beat this.  Saturday morning I was headed to the gym for my weekly hoops dose. When I paused momentarily at a stop sign, I saw something amusing. A small column of chubby, salon-tanned girls were power walking their way toward the Plaza, Kansas City’s (only) historic, ritzy shopping district. The last adventurer in this plucky band had a Camelbak hydration system strapped to her back, presumably to keep her cool and wet in the arid wilds of the Plaza.  Uh, Ashley…like, wait. Help me…crawl to the nearest GAP.      Is that symptomatic of our culture or what?

A non-touristy music venue oozing atmosphere, dedicated to traditional jazz. And I'm not even a jazz-lover.      (We recently returned from a 5-day vacation in New Orleans. Welcome to the photolog...
