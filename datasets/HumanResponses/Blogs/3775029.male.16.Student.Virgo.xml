      30/06/04 - Felt woozy today.. so took an mc and skipped school. Got lots of homework though.. Maths, Physics, Chem and English. 4 subjects. Wow.. I'm gonna have a great time doing them.. :S  Heard from my classmates today was hell. Ha.. glad I didn't go to school today =D Said maths lesson was rough. The whole class got a major lecturing for being in the 'holiday mood'. Totally no mood to study after holidays man.. But can tell everbody is trying very hard. O levels is not something that can be played around with. I'm downright scared of it. 3 more months to the preliminary exams. Gotta really catch up if I want to pass it.   Alright, I'm gonna rest up awhile.. good day to those reading this. Peace.. ;)  "Unleash the power within..."

      29/06/04 - Sucky day at school. So no use talking about it.. Hurried home after school for some sleep.. Really tired today.. slept through the last 3 periods of the day lol..  I saw this girl at Coral Sec's bustop while on the bus home.. Man! was she pretty~! Her ponytail was so long, it reached her ass. And that pretty face of hers.. I was like 'WOW' lol! Maybe I'll see her one day.. then I'll ask her number haha. Nah, juz kidding. Wouldn't dare to anyway. Then there was this guy and girl I saw at a coffeeshop near my place. The guy was like shouting at her. Saying something like, "Why don't you want to come to my house?" Bloody sicko.. Hope the girl's alright..   Got new books to get.. lost my science TYS! I knew I shouldn't have left them at school. Someone must have stolen them during the holidays. (Well, that gives me a good excuse to escape my teacher's wrath!) hahaha! Gonna buy them later.. Lots of homework too.. Boring!   Breaking - Gonna practice on my flares and footwork after my work. Gonna seriously try out airflares too. Hope I can get them soon..

      28/06/2004 - 1st day of school. Have you ever had the feeling of time warping itself?              It flies so fast when you're not noticing. You close an eye and when you               reopen it, the holidays are gone! Darn, I was just starting to have fun!  Anyway, I slept at 2+ and woke at 6. Strangely, I didn't feel tired at all during classes. Speaking of classes, today was a real mess. Teachers were going through things so fast, I couldn't understand a thing. Lol, I hope I'm not gonna lag behind.. Escaped from the discipline mistress also this morning.. I was sporting long hair (now cut) and I practically walked past her without even catching her attention. Hehe.. I'm gonna try that again some day..  When I got home, I decided to do a countdown to my O levels as well as after them. TOTAL FREEDOM!!! WOOOO!! okok, lets not get carried away. got exactly 10 weeks to my prelims. After that, everyone's gonna go full speed ahead. I've never been a studying person but this time round, I don't really have a choice.. things are starting to change in me..   Worries - August, there will be a Bboy showcase at Causeway Point down at Woodlands.            I wonder Inertia would do? Training really hard on my flares and headspins now.           And sometimes just play around with airflares.. I hope we put on a good show..           There's FloorSkillz too.. man..
