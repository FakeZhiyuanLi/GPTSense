      Ugh it is 3am and I am working on my website... I mean, what else do I do at 3am? The One Boards are beginning to bore me more than ever, so I just went and posted a bit on the Cinescape Harry Potter boards. I like that place so much more! It was so much more entertaining... I can't get this one stupid thing to work on the internet! You have to pay for freaking everything cool. You can't do anything fun for free. Oh well... Tomorrow I am going to the barn! Yay! I will probably ride Waldo the psyco horse again, but it is kind of fun now that I know how to keep him from killing me! I don't know why I keep thinking about Matt. It is so stupid because he is a freaking senior now and I won't even see him anymore after he leaves for college (if he is even going to college... LOL). I am going to go now to work on the gay website that won't let me do cool things.

      I have started up my LiveJournal! Thanks a bunch to mika for it! It is waaay to early in the morning for me to be doing this! I really should go to bed, but that is ok because it looks like I am back to my nocturnal schedule! I went on vacation with my family... We first went to Corpus Christi, and after about 3 days we went and stayed in South Padre. I got sooo sunburnt when we went to Schlitterbahn! I feel like I am as tan as an Indian or something! And then, we went horsebackriding on the beach. It was really fun, but my horse wouldn't stop! He would go faster and faster everytime that the guide tried to catch up with him! I was pulling so hard with the reins that I couldn't feel my finger, and now I still can't feel it!! Ahh! Well, I will be back tomorrow! (Well, actually today, but oh well...)

      It might just be an obsession; maybe it iwll pass, but I am so into this guy and I have no idea why. Well, actually I have a pretty good idea why, but I'll get to that later. I didn't even know who he was or anything, and I had never seen him before save one time. I was in PreCal, doing my work, and I looked up. There was this guy (who I had never even heard talk) staring at me. I figured that I was probably making a weird face or something while I was trying my hardest not to fail this quiz, but I caught him doing it about 3 more times within the next two weeks. I thought that he was pretty cute, but I wasn't going to talk to him. I had never heard him talk in class and I was only 3 seats behind him. If he wasn't a nerd or a freak he would have tried to join in on the conversation when I was talking to Kaitlin or something (she sits right behind him). Anyways, one day at lunch I was talking to Carolyn, and she was like, "Do you know Hunter?" But I had no idea at all who it was, so I told her no. Then she described him to me, and I remembered, so I was like "Yeah, I've seen him staring at me a few times." And I started wondering why she had brought this up, and how she knew him... Then she told me "He thinks your hot" and I was thinking all sorts of crazy shit... I don't even know. I just kind of sat there for a second, stunned. She explained that he had just moved from Egypt that past summer, and that he didn't really know that many people. That was why he was so shy. Well, in PreCal, it ended up being me that was staring at him for the majority of the class period. I never introduced myself or anything b/c it would just be weird. I mean, what are you going to say to someone that you don't even know? I guess I could have been like "Whoa, I did soo bad on that one quiz... blah blah!" and started a conversation, but I hate rejection. So, I didn't. Well, one day all of a sudden I was at church and Jessica our youth director was like "Hey there is this new kid, Hunter. You should go talk to him." And so I went and I talked a bit, but he was really quiet, but I don't blame him. It was a good thing, though, because otherwise I would have thought that he was annoying or something. So I started talking to him, and then we talked at school, too. It turns out that he is also in Ellen's English class. Now I don't know how it started, but one day a week or two ago he asked for my number, and I gave him my cell. Now we talk every night even though he has a girl friend. He really likes her a lot, but he thinks that she is going to break up with him soon for a bunch of stupid reasons. Part of me wants him to break up with her, but then again, I like our relationship now. There is absolutely no pressure. We can say whatever we want to eachother and stuff. Well, on Sunday was my birthday, but his birthday was 6 days earlier, so on Saturday he had a kind of get together at his house. I started to walk there when it began raining. Then I called him and got one of his friends to pick me up even though I was soaking wet. I bought Hunter the Donnie Darko DVD because me and Ellen are always talking about it at church and he is like "What are y'all talking about?" So yeah... And he watched it with his friends and he said that it was really cool. So then, he was like "I am getting you something for your bday," but I told him not to worry about it. Then, this Wednesday night, it was movie night at youth group. I went with Ellen to Kroger earlier so that we could buy a bunch of food. When I got there, Ellen was like "I have a secret that I know, but I can't tell you." And I thought that it was something bad like that she had to work all this weekend again. But, when we got to church, it turned out that Hunter had flowers for me for my birthday! Then, for the movie we watched Goundhog's Day which was good because part of it was a love movie. Then, Matt drives me home every Wednesday night, and Hunter sees this. I think that it is good for both of them because it makes them both jealous. Well, Matt was like "Kirsten let's go! Kirsten let's go!" But I was putting away my sodas that I had bought. Then Matt walked off somewhere -- to go to the bathroom or something; I dunno. So, I went outside with Hunter, but as soon as I was outside, Matt was there again. I started walking to his car, but I turned around just to see him saying something to Hunter. Then Hunter said something back, but I don't know what. When we got in the car I asked Matt what he had said to Hunter, but he wouldn't tell me. And we sat there for about a minute arguing about it. From where we were sitting, Hunter couldn't see us because there was a pole in the way, but we were just sitting in the parking spot so long that Hunter looked over to see what was going on. Just then, Matt started to back out. Everytime that he backs out, he puts his arm around the back of my chair so that he can turn around and look out the back. Just when Hunter looked over, he did this. I was like "Ah shit.." because last week me and Hunter had a whole big discussion about Matt...  Well, there is so much more to say, but I really have to study for retarded Chemistry. Yay! Halloween tomorrow. I need to get Jessie to go trick-or-treating with me! Too old? I am not too old to go trick-or-treating! ;)

      So much has happened since I have written. I will write later this afternoon. Not that anyone reads this or anything, but I just like writing... Last night and the night before were both great. *sigh* Hunter and Ellen... It seems that things are starting to calm down and make more sense. Well, I will be back later.

      Wow... I haven't written in a long time, but I will write a bit. There has been so much going on that I don't even know where to start. Well, first I went to the mall that Friday with Hunter. We went to see Matrix 3, but since we aren't 17 we bought tickets to Scary Movie 3. Then we went and walked around. We talked a lot, and he wanted to take me to dinner at the Rainforest Cafe, but I told him no. For one, it would be way too expensive, and also, I hate when people spent money on me (especially when they have a girlfriend). So we went to the food court. I ate a hamburger and he ate nothing. We talked a ton. He talked about life in Egypt, and I talked about everything. Then we went to the movies. We went to see Texas Chainsaw Massacre instead, but got kicked out after about 5 minutes. So, we went to FYE instead. We played table hockey, and I got beat miserably. Then we wandered FYE's music section or whatever it is called. We talked about a lot of music and listened to some. Then we went to Jillians. Hunter wanted to go dancing, and so did I but I was still uneasy about this whole having a girlfriend thing. But we went anyways, and the Groove Shack was closed for some wedding. So we stood there for about ten minutes talking. I could tell that he wanted to kiss me, but I wasn't going to let him. We went outside and sat out there, and I wore his sweatshirt because it was cold outside. Then we went back inside and sat on those massage chairs. We talked until about 10:30 pm when my dad came and picked us up. When I got home, my jacket smelled like him, and I never wanted to take it off.   Well, it turns out that Hunter ended up being sick on Monday and Tuesday, so his girlfriend was obviously really pissed off. On Wednesday morning before 1st period, she dumped him. He could tell that it had been coming for a while now, but he was still really sad. He said on the phone that he thought that he loved her.   Well, on Thursday he came over to my house. We were going to do precal, and then watch Identity. We did some precal, but then didn't end up watching Identity because he was all over me. Squeezing my leg and putting his face right up in mine. Then, he asked me, "Do you want to?" And I responded by saying, "Yes, but it just doesn't feel right." He felt really bad about it, and called later to apologize profusely. I told him not to worry about it. On Friday, after school I told him to meet me at my locker. I was determined to make the first move and kiss him on Friday, but instead I just handed him the note that I had promised. Before I left, I gave him a hug which I could tell that he totally did not expect and walked off.  I had to leave for the weekend which sucked, but in a sense, the timing couldn't be better. On Friday on the way up, I textmessaged him. He went to see Scary Movie 3 all by himself, and then just went home. He said that he was really depressed, and I felt awful that I couldn't be there for him. On Saturday in the afternoon I called him because I had freetime at the church retreat that I was mentoring at. Mike (Hunter's best friend) was over at his house, but was in the shower. One of the first things that Hunter said (acutally I think this was in a text message...) was that he and Amanda were getting back together because they were both miserable. Oh, this was Friday night! I remember. Well, I was like ummm ok. And he asked if it was a bad thing. I said that we both knew what I wanted to say, but I wasn't going to say it. I also said that I didn't understand why he thought he loved a girl who doesn't have time for him, doesn't talk to him on the phone, doesn't pay that much attention to him, and has mean friends. I told him that he was taking the easy way out. He kept asking me what I thought about it, and I wasn't going to admit it to him, but I was completely heartbroken.   We talked again on Saturday when Mike was over at his house, and we text messaged all during the dance and through the night. I told him that Amanda had him whipped, and each time that I talked to him it seemed less and less like they were going to get back together on Monday. Then I called him at midnight again, and we talked. He wanted to know when I was coming back, and he wanted me to come over to his house. He said that he needed help with precal, but as soon as I went over there he was like "I don't feel like studying." We went upstairs to his living room, and I noticed that he had new furniture. I sat down on his couch and began to eat my gummy bears while watching the football game. He got closer and closer to me until finally, I don't know how it happened, but we just kissed. My mouth was full of gummy bears which was probably a good thing because my breath would have been nasty. And it wasn't just a little kiss, it was a full out French kiss, and I have never even been kissed before (besides truth or dare, but that doesn't really count)! It came so naturally though... I asked him if he wanted a gummy bear, and he ate it. Then I asked him if he wanted another one. He took it from me, and held it in his lips. Then he told me to take it from him, so I did. Well, one thing lead to another, and we were making out all over the couch. Then he led me into his room, and we were making out all over the bed. He was on top of me, and it felt so nice to just lay there with him kissing me. Then he made me put on this skirt that I promised that I would put on. He had his hands all over my butt and told me that I had a nice ass. I didn't want to wear the skirt, so I refused to kiss him until I could put on my pants again. So instead he kissed all up and down my neck. It was like nothing I have ever felt before. Then after I put back on my pants, we went back onto his bed and I was on top of him. I kept falling asleep though because of lack of sleep from the weekend. I was so tired. Then he rolled me off the bed and onto the floor. He wrapped his legs around me, and said that he wanted to stay here forever. I told him that forever was a long time. Then he said that he loved me and that he had been feeling this way for a long time. I told him that I thought that I loved him, but I wasn't sure. And that I didn't want to tell him that I loved him until I was sure. I just don't know though... Because he said that he thought that he loved Amanda. He tells me how beautiful I am, and how great I am at kissing even though that was the first time that I had ever frenched someone.  But then, tonight, he really confused me. He told me that he cared about me, but then he also said that he liked being single and didn't want a relationship just yet... I don't understand boys. So, since he has been saying so much how girls are so confusing, I textmessaged him saying how confusing guys are.   That is pretty much all for today. I don't know. This is kind of eating my life. It is taking over. I can't think about anyone but Hunter, and I haven't done my homework in about a week. Ellen is right; I am smitten...  Oh, and I am going to try to write in here more frequently. ;)

      I am soo sick that I came home from school today after 3rd period. So much fun stuff happened on Wednesday night! But I really need to do homework, so I have to go! Me and Ellen are halfway better. We are talking again and things seem to be ok, but we have yet to mention Hunter really. Also, Hunter called me and we had this really in depth convo that I could write a shitload about... Yeah, soooo much HW though! Ahh!

      Yay I am so happy that my site is up again! I could dance and sing and run in circles, but I am tired. Hunter called (like every night). There is so much that I want to say about it, but I don't even know where to start. We actually got through most of the preCal, though now I am not sure whether he wants to go out with me. Damn boys sending mixed signals. Meanwhile, the soap opera continues with Amanda... Ok, I just needed to write a bit, but there is so much more to say. I have to go! :P

      I do'nt understand why I didn't see it before... It was so obvious. I think that I have just found all the proof I need to confirm why Ellen acts so belligerent around guys. I was reading her LJ, and I responded to it. I would tell you all that I wrote, but it is soooo long that it probably would fill up as much as 3 or 4 journal entries (and I write entries that are long enough as it is). I made rebuttles on everything that she said. Grr I don't even want to go through it again.  Anyways, on to the Aha! Experience... Ellen is acts like she doesn't care that much about guys when she is around them. She gets so easily pissed about Hunter and Matt all the time or whenever some guy says something about her. She just gets mad and pissy, but then tries to give the impression that she doesn't care. The thing is that I am not the prettiest girl around, so I never had guys chasing me. There have been a few, but I just really haven't felt anything like this before. It is an odd feeling, and I don't even know how to respond. Anyways... I was reading more of Ellen's LJ before I bitched back. She was talking about this guy, Jason, and how she is totally "infatuated" with him despite the fact that he is 8 years older than she is. On the other hand, she is totally "infatuated" with Cory despite the fact that she has never talked to him other than online, he is bi, and he lives in Virginia. Then, I was reading her LJ she wrote all this stuff about when they went to the Haunted House, he held her hand, and she really liked that feeling and wanted to save it forever or something. Then there is the thing that I mentioned about the Armageddeon movie with the animal cracker scene. Also, she was so excited when she thought that Cory really liked her. When I told her that it was all a big joke, she got all pissy again, and wouldn't talk to me. Truthfully, I should have stayed mad at her, but I couldn't because I felt mad. I thought that it was my fault, but upon rethinking it numerous times, I have come the the conclusion that she was overreacting. That is what this whole Hunter situation is... Jealousy and overreacting. She gets mad, wallows in her own sorrow, posts it in her LJ and makes it seem like her life is just *so* awful, and then gets people to respond about it. I told her that "I am not going to pull a damn Lisa." She thinks that it is the end of the world, but it isn't. My God, can she just step back and look at how stupid this whole thing is?

      As if I haven't written enough today... I don't know what the hell to do with my life. Have you ever had those days that you are like "WTF is life? Why do people save up all this money until they are old and wrinkley so that the can relax and 'enjoy' it then?" There is some quote that goes something like "Choose a profession that you love, and you'll never work a day in your life." That is what I feel that I have to do. That is why I have decided that by the age of 35 I am going to have a barn of my own. First, I want to help out at some other barn, so that I can gain experience and learn how to train. Also, that way I may be able to board a horse at that barn for cheap or free if I help out by teaching lessons and training. However, I will need to have some sort of "real job" with which I can earn and save money. Grrr... The thing is that it should probably at night because my horse thing would go on during the day. Maybe I could work the night shift at a fast food restaraunt. :P Oh, please no!

      I just got off the phone with him, and it read: Call Ended 1:28:32! Holy crap! He always calls and we talk a bit about preCal, but today he also talked about Amanda. He thinks that she is jealous of me, and she damn well should be. He spends more time on the phone with me than he does with her. He told me that she was saying things like, "I know that something is going on with you two," but he was like "No, really there is nothing" because we haven't done anything. Then Hunter said something like "I don't want her to ruin our friendship." Also last night he was like "What is wrong with having a really good girl friend?" when he was talking a bit about Amanda... That is what I mean by confused signals. Then he says all this stuff about "Yeah, I should take you out to a party sometime." Then we were discussing Hillary Duff because one day he was like "She is hott," so I ripped her pic out of a magazine for him. I told her that she was from Texas, so he said that all the pretty girls were from Texas and told me that I was pretty!! So we kept talking about random things, but then going back to preCal and "studying" a bit. We actually got a few problems done for practice, but he is kind of slow. Oh, and then he asked me who I liked... I wanted to say that the guy I liked had a girlfriend so that it doesn't even matter. Ahh Amanda just IMed me right now. We are talking about scrapbooking club. But back to the thing about who I liked. I talked about Eric and how I liked him last year, but how we didn't have anything in common anymore. Then we just started to talk about everything. He talked about his time when he lived in Egypt... We talked about everything. Talked about baseball pants, and how I can't play baseball because I can't hit the ball. Then Hunter was like "I'll teach you." We talked about so much, and I am so confused. Does he just like me as a friend? Or more? He tells me that I am pretty, he tells me that he should take me out some time to a party, he tells me that he really wants to go to Germany, he calls me every night, we talk for hours at a time, he gets me flowers for his birthday, but... At the same time he still has a girl friend. This makes my brain hurt.

      Wow even though it is midnight, guess who just called from his vacation in Lubbock? Hunter. :) Ok, I admit, I am obsessed, but I am just crazy in love. We talked about a bunch of random stuff. He went to a frat party, and he told me about how he was drinking and dancing with other girls.

      Ok, even though I just posted, I have some more to say. I think that I know why Ellen is acting the way that she is acting. She is really lustful. She really wants a guy. The problem is that guys around here first looks at looks, then consider your personality. Because Ellen is Asian, many guys won't even consider going out with her. And... as a result of that, she has not even tried to be appealing to guys (except for the other day when she wore nice pants, nice shoes, and a pretty shirt). You can tell that she really wants a guy just because of the way that she talks. She sees Emily (who isn't that pretty) talking about how she went to homecoming and how she made out with this guy and that guy, and Ellen feels jealous. Before, when we were watching Armagaddon, and there is this one scene where Brad Pitt and Liv Tyler are just having a picnic. They are being super sweet and everything, and Ellen was like "Too bad that is never going to happen to me." She is maturing liek all of us, but the thing is that there aren't any guys interested in us. Now, when I am finally getting involved with guys, Ellen is getting jealous of it. She says I spend more time with Hunter than I do with her. The thing is that I am attracted to him, and I really can't do anything about it. What I hate is how she acts like her life is such a hell-hole. She complains about the future and everything when she has a hell of a better life than me. She has a job that she enjoys and makes plenty of money with, her parents are going to buy her a car and pay for the insurance, she is dilligent and studious, and she gets good grades. So, basically, she sees me getting the guys and is pissed off b/c of jealousy. She is also so mean about Matt and Kevin.

      Ok, now that I have talked about Hunter, I have to talk about Ellen. She is soo pissy about him. She doesn't know it, but I read her Live Journal, and I cannot believe the kind of stuff that she puts in there about me. First of all, she is always so mean about people. Not really mean to their face or anything, but just mean when talking about them or mean behind their back. I think that it is definitely jealousy. In her LJ she said a bunch of stuff about how I shared things with Hunter that we "secrets" between us. It is such bullshit. Can't I tell a guy about "Badger, Badger"? And the other day we were talking about how I gave Hunter Donnie Darko, and all his friends watched it and liked it. Then, she was all talking about how it just isn't cool anymore because it was fun when not that many people new about it. So then I was like, "So you can tell Denise and lots of other people, but I can't tell guys about it. So, that's it. That is only 5 more people." She is just being so stupid. In her LJ she called me an airhead, and said that when I talked to her, all I did was brag about stuff (mostly Hunter). For one, I am not bragging, and the only thing that would make her perceive it as bragging was if she was jealous. Second of all, what if I want to talk about Hunter? What if that is what is on my mind? Shouldn't she be happy for me or something? If she was having a problem with this shouldn't she have confronted me instead of saying all this stuff about me? Then, she complains about how I got pissed at her and wouldn't talk to her for the rest of the day when she said that she isn't going to Germany. We had been planning this all along! She was half the reason that I signed up to go! If she hadn't signed up, I wouldn't have signed up! The only fun person going is going to be Emily; Matt isn't even going, and Hunter is going to Egypt at about the same time as Germany. He really wants to come.

      Ah I decided to start using this LJ because I don't like my other blog. It has so many memories of when I adored Hunter. Reading it is kind of sickening... Yuck.  I am going to start writing in here because it is good to save these memories... They are funny to look back on; the feelings right after something happened are the coolest to look back on, no matter how stupid they were.  Anyways, right now I can't type it all up because I have to put up my Valentine's Day layout for my site!

      Well, let's see about updates since I last wrote.  Had a long time thing going with Hunter... Lasted until the first weekend in December. I invited him to the TASHA show to watch me, and he did. That show was the official closing of the barn, so I was really depressed and sort of removed myself from him and all other people. He took it as I didn't like him anymore Then a week and a half later when I was coing back around he started acting all, "Let's just be friends." I was devastated. We had arguemnets fro about another week and I cried alot, only to find out that he liked Jordan instead. I was pissed off, didn't talk to him for a few days; then he called me, we went to the mall and saw the movie Paycheck, I felt better. By then he had been going out with Jordan for about 2 days. We went back to school. Jordan dumped him after having gone out for about 6 days. I liked him still, but wasn't going to take him back after what he did. Started to like him again, be more open again, stopped liking him again, came to his house on Friday before Senior High Gather (go here for pictures), and he tried to make out wiht me. I was going to ask him to Sadie as a friend, but he was too horny. Spent the weekend with Ellen, Brian, Michelle, Shannon at church retreat. Fell for Brian. *insert Senior High dance story here*   Yeah that is basically it... I have 3 major stories to tell still, though!

      I don't remember all of it, but this is what I do remember:  I went to the movies with Brian, but I don't remember waht movie I saw. It was just him and me, and I remember sititn gin the theater just playing footsie. Then my parents had to come and pick me up, but somehow I had my old Harry Potter cellphone wiht me. I think that we were at the church or something because I had to talk through a building that looked something like the Sunday school building but actually it was a cell phone store or something. This guy tried to fix my cellphone, but I said not to worry about it. Then I looked outside and saw Brian getting into my paren'ts car so I wnt out there and joined him. I don't know what happened next, but I found my real cellphone in my purse (the camera bag one), and text-message Brian. I had a few really weird messages come back from people. Jessie's cousin Ross sent me a text message that just showed an opened up and burning cigarette lighter on the screen then asked for a confirmation that I had seen the message. There was one other like that, but I don't remember who it was from. But, there weren't any text messages from Brian. Then I don't really remember what happened in between, but I think that in a previous dream somehow my really expensive camera got stolen. We got the location of where it was, and we were driving. It was really weird because my legs were hanging through the bottom of the car. The person that was driving was someone that I knew, but it was like mika or someone (a person younger than me that I don't really know that well... maybe I knew them from onine or something). As we were driving I saw a few different poilice cars along tghe way, and I realized what we were doing was illegal. It was late at night when we were driving, and this girl had two people in her car that weren't family. The polica cars never stopped us, thankfully. Well, we started following thei one go-cart, and I don't nkow if we were following it because we were following it or if it just happened to be going in that same direction, but we ended up following it for about half a mile. We turned off the main road onto someone's property and drove by this really shitty house. Then we drove through this door-ish square oepening in a huge, really tall chain-link fence. Then, just a littlebit ahead of us, we saw an open garage with a car and a bunch of teenagers all sitting around. I got out of the car (though I don't remember getting out of the car or how I did), and went over to them. There was a girl sitting on the floor with a backpack, and a bunch of guys sitting around a table or a car or someting they were sitting around... I am pretty sure it was a table with some stuff sitting on top of it. Well I went up tot he backpack and I was yelling at them about my camera, but the girl didn't object when I started to opent eh backpack. The weird thing was that this backpack was the same type of backpack tha tmine was, bnad it was the same colors. I started going through it, talking about my camera, and the other people who were there were like "Why do you care aabout $6?" They obviously didn't knonw which one I was talking about. "Six dollars? More like $300!" Wile I was digging through the bag, I was like "Ya know, these are teh kind of cases that make me want to be a detective." And I pulled out my camera, and the lens caps. "Where are the lenses?" I asked. And a guy who was sitting at the other table tossed them to me, but they were uncovered. And I sort of yelled at him, too, saying that they'd have to pay for them if they were scratched. I don't know how long we were there for before I actually got my camera (it was probably top about 3 minutes), but there was one guy there who was looking me up and down saying how if I'd screw him, he'd give me the camera. Well anyway, all of a sudden someoone shouted "Run!" and I thought it was the cops, so I just ran. I was wearing pink flip-flops, so it was difficult to run through the muddy grass, and the high grass. I tried to run without my shoes, but it hurt my feet. When I was running, I heard a car door slam, and my dad began calling "Kirsten! Rachel!" As I got over this one set of bush things, there was a lake of sorts... Some people were running to the right of it, some were running to the left. I was too far behind because of my flip-flops, and I just lept into the lake and submerged myself. The water wasn't cool, in fact, it was pretty warm. But I had my camera bag with me (this one jean purse that I take all over the place), and it had my cellphone in there and I think my camera. I tried to submerge that, too, but I was really worried about it ruining everything in there. I was also worried that my hair and the bag were floating up towards to top. My dad came all the way up to the lake, and I could see his feet. I don't know if he saw my hair or not... He was saying things like "Why have you left us, Kirsten, for these other people?" And I kind of saw images of the guys who were in the garage flash mefore my eyes. That is all that I remember...

      I just updated the spring break events thing because I found the paper in my backpack... Well, anyways. I have to go finish my homework right now -- eek.   I totally fucked up my computer doing God knows what. I haven't seen Brian in over a week except for at Sun night church for about 15 seconds. I have talked to him on the phone, but not that much because I was busy.   I went to Pin OAk downtown on Saturday which was really sad because I went through a "that could be me" phase or whatever. Saw a bunch of people that I know that brought back sad feelings from December. And, of course, whenever we are around Saddlebred people, Dorothy comes up again. Steve is in the hospital because he isn't taking care of himself, drinking, living from social security check to check, etc...   But anyways... Time for homework.

      I just remembered that I had a dream...   I was going into World History class, and I didn't know anything about the test that day, and I was thinking about faking sick but somehow I just decided not to.   Oh and then I was in someone's backyard and they had a pool, and they asked me to get some sort of noteboook or binder out of the bottom of the pool. I had my contacts in and I tried to go down and get it and I had to squint to see what was goingon. I know there ismore but I don't remmeber.

      I was a beautiful white lion and I was in some sort of amusement park thing that was the inside of this things' body. You went around in circles and at one point you had to get out and walk for a bit b/c there were mushrooms and fertilized in stead of teh veins of the amnimal to go on. but it made you do all sorts of weird thigns when you were on it. You would flip over and I don' t even kno how to descrinbe it. All this time there were words floating around the "canal" that I was in. I think that I had turned into a human by now.   Then I was babysitting but I was in my own house, and I kept yelling at the younger kid b/c it kept doing stupid things and the older one kept getting into its Christmas presents even thought they were addressed to me and Rachel from omom and dad. And there was some HP present that I think was some sort of chocolate or somtheing and it looked like a bell that was extended legthwise. And inside there was some sort of tatoo. And then there was a pile of Reeses cups. The little ones. And I stacked them waaay up high. Well, I think the older one wanted this blue jello with little marchmellows in it. I brought it out and went to put it back into the fridge, but then he lunged for it, grabbed it, and it went everywhere. I started yelilng at him and I was ticked off and I made him clean it up. Then there was some pmna in our family room sitting in one of our chairs who was watching me, and as teh ounger child owas writhing on the floor screaming over somethign stupid and I wwa strying to comfort him, the man got up and was making comments about how this was the oudest study house or studyhall that he had even been in and he left from our kitchen door.   Grnadma Jo was here. I think that this was at teh beginning of the dream. Somehow she was here to stay and we werere in our backyard on the little slab of pavement that we call a patio and there was a set o frisers back there. I thin kthat my mom was talking to her b/c she was going to be staying here in Houston -- I don't remember whether it was going to be at our house or if i tiwas going to be at a hotel or somethign -- but mom wasd tlking to her about joining the chior at church and GJ was going to be the 2nd best singer or somethign. And I think that I cut my hair, but I don't remember if it was me or someone else... I am prety sure that it was me.

      Yeah, I only have one more thing for homework... How odd. Well, I am trying to come up wiht an idea for a new laout for my site, but no ideas are coming. I think that I am going to make a St. Patty's Day Layout first. Well, yeah. I just thought that I should come here and write about Saturday night or something, but I am too lazy. Just read Ellen's entry here: http://www.livejournal.com/~reefsun/36376.html.   THat is basically it. Today was nothing really. School was so-so. I got charged with truency (skippping class) and received a 4 hour Saturday detention. But... I was in the nurse, so we got it all cleared up and now I am good to go. :)   My grandpa is pretty sick... He need to get a pacemaker for his heart. I think that he already got that, but need surgery tomorrow. I can tell that it is really stressing out my mom who is already pretty bitchy already. I feel bad for ehr and I am worried that something like this could push her over the edge or something. Now is a time that I really wished that I believed in God because I could turn to him for comfort... My grandpa has really strong faith, so atleast he knows that Jesus is watching over him. I just don't know what I believe anymore...   I have this freaking huge lump on my head. It isn't like a pimple, but it is sooo freaking annoying! My mom said it was prob an inverted pimple or something.   Oh, and on Sunday I was outside all day in my bathing suit and I got soooo sun burnt! It hurts! It is much better today because I have been putting aloe on it all the time. But then I went out bicycling again today. Hopefully my shoulders aren't too burnt. :P   Yay! Tuesday after Spring Break me, Ellen, and Brian are going to see Story of the Year at this place downtown called Numbers. Ellen's mom is driving. She doesn't know it, but we have been all the way down there (refer to Ellen's Sat nite anecdote LOL).   Sometimes I don't think that Brian likes me that much, but I also think that I am overreacting. Because I have that feeling when he is not around or when I am not talking to him, but then wehn I talk to him or when I am around him he is really sweet. It is just my mind playing tricks on me, right? I think that I just need to work on trusting him that is all...   Ellen is soooo much better about Brian too. She likes to invite him places and stuff now which is cool.   Aww it will be a month that me and Brian have been going out on Friday. I think that I should do somethign because I know that he won't remember, but I don't know what to do. Besides, on Friday I am going shopping I think! Yay for shopping!   Hmm I am going to go now and try to figure out what to do for our one month anniversary. :)

      Friday and Saturday night were really awesome. :)   Friday I went to the carnival at Katy HS. I went with Dani, Cassie, Jessie, Landon, Rockelle, Mellissa, Eric, Erin, Natalia... I think that it everyone. There was this awesome spinning ride that we rode 3 times, then there was a ferris wheel that we rode 2 times. The second time me, Cassie, and Dani were stopped at the top and we flashed everyone. Also there is this upsidedown ride and there were bumper cars. It was awesome. Then afterwards we went to Sonic. We hung out there and met some guys from Taylor. One said that he kenw Brian :) Another said that he pulled a knife on Jared Hankins and spent 3 months in prison. Eeek.   Then Brian met me there, and we went to Westheimer. Raced a bit. Then we went to to Ellen's for about 20 minutes. THen he dropped me off at my house. Yeah, it was fun. :)

      Okay... My dream that I just remembered.   I am at Ellen's house abbysitting some kids. I think that there are 3 of them. But Ellen's house doesn't look like Ellen's house, it looks exactly like my grandparent's house (my mom's parents), but it has a second floor... Maybe it is kinda like teh Schindhettee's house I dunno. So I am babysitting there and all of a sudden I realized that I forgot to pick up Katie to come and babysit with me. SO I try to call my mom but the phone is soooo freaking weird. It is like a pump like some pampered chef tool, and you have to pump to dial it. There are two other kids in the other room adjacent adn the door keeps swining open and they keep hearing me. So I am calling my mom and I tell her that I need her to pick up Katie and bring her here. I started babysitting at 5:30pm, but now it was 6 something and she still hadn't called wondering what was going on. The first time that I called my mom it was all fuzzy. I don't remember if it was the first or second time that I called her but I started almost crying on the phone and the door kept swining onoepna dn I didn't want the kids to see that I was almost crying so I sort of tried to slam it.   Then I remember another time looking at some sort of party music machine where you put in 5 cds or 5 tapes adn you put the little pamphlets from them on top of it and then it plays. I couldn't figure out how to make it work until I realized that you needed to have the CDs in there, but tehn I remmebered that all the CDs are in Ellen's car. There was a Blink182 CD in there that I really wanted to listen to but I coudn't and I waskind of sad.   Then there is some other part where we are travelling somewhere and I think that I am looking at a magazine and I call my mom again. I have no idea what I was takling to her about but I called her and it had somethignt o do with makeup but then about 10 seconds later I was like 'oh nm.'   Then there is this last part of my dream where I somehow met up with some people who were with their horsesThey were pretty highsrtrung and had a lot of leg motion in the front. They were walking down the raod in front of teh neighborhood where I live and somehow I ended up right next to some of these people with their horses. We cross teh roaxd and turned into my subdivision with them. Then we stood at teh end of the first road in that subdivision while someone was checking somethign out ebfore we went down to the right wher ethese horses were going. I was holding one and some other people were holding others.   Oh I think that before I was in teh car with Cassie driving somewhere back home maybe and we wenated to do someting, but we decided that we were going to go boarting on teh bayou in little boats which is why the person who was holindg the other horse was talking about how this horse was going to learn how to swim.   Anyways, so we are all standing around there at teh end of the road at the entrance to my subdivision and then someone comes back to tell us that we can't keep the ohrses there. When we turn around, and go out of my subdiviosn (all of this horse stuff is happeneing when eveining is falling outside) and cross mason road and we get to the other side, we see that the field at BEck Jr (the huge fenced in area is filled with horses and trailers and stuff. Before when we had looked at it from across the road, it just looked like there were a few horses over there like one or two. Then when we got to the other side, we started getting worried about taking the hroses there because we saw a cop car and thought that maybe it would be considered trespassing. While we were standing over there I figured out that all of these horses are probably here for the horse show. The othe rpeeople said that we could just sneak in but I told them that I didn't think that we could because they always ask which barn you are riding for and/or what classes you are entered in. So, then one of teh other people came up to our group and said that tyhey think that they have just tricked their way into getting in because they had just told the vet something about one of tehir horse's legs.   I don't remember anything after that... Very odd... :)

      I just remembered part of a dream that I had last night.   We were in some kind of room... It was a bunch of church people... And Hunter was having seizures or his face was turning red or he was really sick or (EDIT LATER: I actually think now that he was turning a dark dark purple)... I don' tknow. But I am sitting there watching until I or someone starts screaming to go and just hug him or hold him or something. (EDIT LATER: I think that I screamed it because I was thinking about how human touch is said to help dying and/or hospitalized people.) So tons of people from our church group (I remember seeing Andy) run at him and give him a hug. And then for some reason we have to start going to a different room, and I take his hand and start walking with him, but I am worried that Brian will see. And then he is okay, but I don't realize it until we have been walking for a while. A bit later he asks me somethign about why I have been so nice to him or something. But I only reply something along the lines of 'Well your life was at stake.'   Now there is another part to this dream that I remebered earlier today, and I don't remember now, but I just remembered this other part of my dream:   I think we are watching a movie or watching something, and I am sitting in someone's lap either Kevin or Brian I can't remember. That is so random. That is all that I know. Hmm weird. (EDIT LATER: I think that I was sitting in someone's lap watching a movie at the church when this ^ happened.)   Well back to my world history paper.

      She wrote me this stupid note that just pisses the heck outta me... I don't know what I am going to do or say about this. All that I can say about this is that she needs to take things with a grain of salt. She is being like my sister; she takes everything sooo personally. Also, if things don't go her way, she pouts about it. AND she is being like Hunter. When people don't want to come over to her house she gets mad. Okay, maybe the second was an unfair comparison, but the first certainly wasn't.    so... Cassie was pissed this morning. For some reason she decided to bring it out on me and bitched me out completely.    From Cassie's side of the story, she was late, and Ellen was like, "Do you have five minutes?" Cassie said that she was having a bad day and told Ellen that she didn't have time. Then Ellen was like, "Fine then I won't show it to you," and Cassie started going on about how Ellen can't take 'no' for an answer...    And you know what she said? Almost word for word about what you said to me earlier. About how I can't take a 'no,' and I get all pissed off.    Hmm maybe there is some truth in that... Especially since it is coming from both of us now. Have you ever considered that, Ellen? Wait. NO! If there wasn't some truth in it, they why would you take so much offense at it. If you didn't believe half of it yourself, you'd be able to brush it away because you'd know that it wasn't true.    So... thanks. You know, Cassie is to both of us a friend, and I thought that she meant more to you than being just a medium through which you can feed bullshit.    Just see my comment above. If you didn't believe it, you wouldn't take such offense at that. Aside from the fact that I am not telling her bullshit about you (hmm I told her why you were mad at me on Sunday; because I came out and said that you can't take 'no' for an answer which is true BTW), what does that have to do with being her friend? Are you implying that I am using her to talk to you or something? Because you know for a fact that I am not scared to just throw whatever is bothering me in your face like I did on the way home from church that one day. Why would I need Cassie as a medium? I talk to her because I am ticked off with your actions, and you are always pissy about something whether it be that I talked to Brian or I talked to Hunter or I didn't walk home from school with you or whatever the tragedy of the moment is... Please name one piece of 'bullshit' that I have told Cassie. Wow. Look at that; you can't. Why? Because I tell her the truth instead of bending it so that it makes me look good the way that you do in your LJ.    Cause its wrecking me and her's friendship.    Yeah, I'm wrecking your friendship. That makes so much sense. Your friendship includes you and Cassie... and I am where? Yes, I am there, but it is your relationship not mine. What I am telling her is what happened. I may not be right, but I tell what I perceive. The only thing keeping me from telling her the complete truth is you because you won't even tell me what the hell is going on. I ask you, and you don't want to talk about it. What do you do instead? You cry, you turn to cigarettes, you write mean and distorted things in your LJ...    Ha... I really feel like I am friendless.    Now this is the kind of shit that just pisses me off. Helloo? Friend. Right here. Though I may not seem very open right now, it is because someone needs to slap you in the face and take you out of the stupid box you've been living in all of tenth grade. What about me? What about Cassie? What about Andy? Speaking of feeding someone bullshit, what have you been telling that poor kid on walks home? If it is anything like what you write in your LJ then your lying to him and to yourself. Dont you see that you are doing it to yourself? We are right here. We have been right here all along, but you keep pushing us away. Everytime that somethign doesn't go the way you had planned it to go, you act all ticked off, make yourself unapproachable, and refuse to talk about it. Now who is not being a friend? You should have been happy for me when I started going out with Brian. Instead you started choking up on the phone and telling me how you can't breathe. Like you said next...    Everyone has motives, right?    What is your motive behind all this? What are you hoping to achieve by playing these games? Freaking out over things, overreacting, pushing others away, refusing to talk about it. What do you expect us to do? Wait. We ask you and you don't tell us. Why? Hell knows why because you won't even look at us. You just sit there with a scowl on your face, unapprochable until you decide to talk about it. Then, like at LP concert, you try to use the excuse that *I* am being unapproachable when I am hugging Brian or holding hands. I am the same fucking person as before. I may have changed or been influenced by him a bit, but I am the same Kirsten. When you talk to me, I am going to pay attention to you; I am not going to ignore you. What are you avoiding? How am I unapproachable? You don't feel comfortable talking to us when we are together? I don't know I am just guessing? Do you feel like you're intruding on something? I don't care! How many times have I told you that I am not going to pull a fucking Lisa on you. I don't know if that is what it is, but you won't freaking tell me, so how the fuck am I supposed to know what is going on?   Returning to motives... What are you implying that I am trying to do? I am not plotting to turn Cassie against you or anything if that is what you are thinking. That is stupid. Why the hell would I want to take away one of your friends? This is the only conclusion that I can come to... ???    I don't know. Maybe I am being a complete arse and everyone but me can see it. But I can't see it so how do you expect me to fix it?    But you can see it; you've acknowledge it before. You know that you freak out over little things that aren't a big deal and you know that you make yourslef unapproachable and you know that you avoid approaching me and Brian and you know that you are hard on Cassie when she can't do things. And you are hard on me when I can't do things either. Like when I was sick and you came over to my house, or when Cassie was sick and she couldn't come (though I do admit that until I saw her on Sunday I didn't really believe her) and when I was sick and couldn't see X2 and you just got all pissy on me (  Then she wrote a bunch of other stuff about how she is just going to go and listen to Hoobastank until some Godly insight comes to her. Then she commetns on how fucked up this week has been...   Ok... Please enlighten me. What is so soul-crushing that everything else is just trivial? If it just SoCo, that is ridiculous. You needed to be realistic and not get your hopes up so high for SoCo because 6 hours away is a loong time. Aside from that, I don't know what else there is so be so fucked up. If you start telling me about school is stressful and stuff like that you might as well be a broken record, so nice try if you are going to excuse your attitude and feelings with that. Ugh I really want to read this to you, but I would have to reread the whole thign because some of it is directly to you, and then the rest of it is to some invisible person. Whatever, maybe I'll just read it to you anyways.

      This excerpt from her LJ was locked, but she doesn't know that I can get into there... I have some comments to make on this because it totally pisses me off how she distorts things.    Today was such an unbelievable roller coaster. I went from feeling like my world had crashed down, to now feeling that I may just have a purpose in life. Or something to work toward, anyway. Well, at church, everything pretty much sucked. Kirsten told me she wan't staying for 11:00 service, she wanted to be with Brian later.    I can just hear Ellen's tone of voice as she says this. She is pissed off and takes it the wrong way. I had told him the night before that I was going to 6 pm service. Wow. Big deal. He's my BF. Learn to share.    And then Kris Ohm tells me that she can't take me to Something Corporate because it's the same weekend her sister is coming down. I'm not angry at her or blame her one bit, though, let's just make that clear. But.. you know, this is Something Corporate, so I can't help it that in the car when I'm driving Kirsten home between Sunday School and church that I'm like silently crying, and tears are just streaming down.     Ok, I know that she loves SC, but I would think that instead of sitting there and crying about it, she'd be trying to find other ways to get there...    "Is this because I'm not going to 11:00?" And then goes on about how I'm too touchy and she's scared I'm going to get angry at everything, blah blah blah.    Acutally it was more like "I know that this isn't the best time to bring this up or anything [this is where she got her next couple lines from... stealing my words], but you have been sooo touchy lately. And everything that I do I have to think about it, and I worried that it will upset you." Oh, and also, during Sunday School when I said that I wasn't going to 11 am service and Ellen made some sort of huff, I told her that I never say 'no' to her, so I don't know why she is pissed off about these things, and she didn't take that very well either. And I love it how she fails to mention that the reason that she was driving me home was because she made me ask a bunch of the sponsors to go on the camping trip, so my dad got pissed off and left the church after looking for me for 10 minutes.    I'm not a freaking time bomb, I am capable of my emotions, and I think I do a damn good job of handling situations.     Hmm I beg to differ. You let things build up inside you and distort them in your mind, making them something they are not. This is evident in your post here and others before it. Although you may not exploded, you are holding it inside just ticking away until one day you do explode... Hmm capable of your emotions? How come you have to relieve stress by smoking when there wasn't even a stressful situation.    But yeah, not the best time to bring up all this.    Thanks for stealing my words.    So I tell her to get out of the car.    Umm no. You just sat there. You didn't say anything to me. ??? WTF is this?    I drove back to church, and just sat in the parking pot, listening to Konstantine, just trying to calm down.    If you knew that what I said wasn't true, then why did it affect you this way? You know that what I tell you has some basis, and you just have a hard time accepting the truth.    Then I went into the church and sat at the back for a while. I saw Hunter sitting by himself, so I went over to join him, and all he does is bitch and complain about Kirsten. I finally just told him that if he wants to say all this stuff, he should just say it to her himself, because I can't and won't do anything about it.    I am so freaking annoyed by that kid... Words can't begin to describe. I haven't talk to him in over 2 weeks. Maybe 3. Why the hell does he still want to talk to me? He fucked things up, now I think he is annoying. End of story.    Yeah, so I hate how Ellen distorts things into something that they are not. Someone needs to smack her back to reality.

      Eek I am excited! I was talking to Brian tonight via text-messages, and he said that he knows some people at Claire's who can probably get my belly button pierced. I don't know if he is serious, but I hope that he is! That would be awesome. Ellen wanted to do it when we turned 18, but I really can't wait. I have been thinking about it sooo much. I really wanted a tatoo, too, but I can't get that for sure. That would be sooo much harder to get and soo much more permanent. Plus, belly button rings are so much fun. ;)   Sometimes Brian confuses teh heck outta me LOL. I can never tell what he is thinking which is weird because I am pretty good at reading guys. He is not the most romantic guy ever -- ok not at all -- but he is super cute. Sometimes I doubt that he likes me, but then he text-messaegs me or calls me at the most random times with nothing to talk about just because he wanted to say hi. He'll tell me about his day or somethign at work and ask what I'm up to... Yeah he is freaking adorable. We have been going out for only a little over 2 weeks. It seems like it has been forever, but at the same time, it has not been that long at all. I don't get to see him very often because he goes to Taylor and I go to Cinco and all, but I talk to him every day. He is such a kid, and so outgoing, and so carefree, and just goes with the flow of things. He will never look at you when you do something stupid and say "that was really dumb" he'll just play along and act all stupid with you. Haha I will probably look back on this like I look back on my Hunter stuff -- disgusted that I could be so infatuated with one guy. But somehow this is a little bit different because I am actually going out with him instead of the stupid friends with benefits mistake that I made before.   I have been talking to Dani about her belly button ring because this is what started this whole thing. I am scared as shit because I think that it is going to hurt, but she says that it is just like a pinch and then it is over. She says that the worst part is being scared beforehand. I know that my parents won't find out about it because they never see me without a shirt or anything. Until the summer atleast... But, even then, they don't see me in a bathing suit that much. The only problem would be if we went on vacation, but I will cross that bridge when I come to it. :)   Shit shit so much homework, but mostly studying: HW notebook for chemistry class, study for chemistry class   Hmm I love this LJ thing because I talk waayy too much and no one else wants to hear about it LOL   Oooh and one more thing! I got some kick-ass new shoes from Old Navy. One pair of sort of plain white flip flops and this other pair of shoes that are wood with straps across the top of my toes with a buckle. Very adorable! Yay!

      Ok well it is nearly 11pm and I haven't started my homework, so yeah... I feel really weird tonight, but I don't know why. I got a regular babysitting job from this woman who is getting her teaching certificate or her degree or something. They have two crazy kids; two little girls. One is about 5 and the other is about 3, I think. Lisa and Jessica. They had an 18 year old brother so they are pretty rowdy a lot of the time. Basically, we just watch movies, color, run around the house, and act all crazy. The people pay $9/hour so it is completely kick-ass. I babysit for them Mondays and Wednesdays, so no more youth group for me. :( Oh well. The only people who are worth seeing at youth group are Ellen (I see her every freaking day anyways), Cassie (I see her every day at school and at church), Brian (I don't get to see him very much except on weekend because we always get him grounded or he is working), Matt, Emily, Kevin, ... I think that is about it.   The reason that I was giddy last entry was because Brian had just asked me out that afternoon -- very adorable boy.     urlLink       ^ There is a picture of us at Senior High Gathering (me and Brian are the ones on the farthest right). SHG was kickass! Me and Ellen were in the same hotel room, and we went to the zoo too. I took pictures of every freaking animal in that whole zoo. And then there was a dance like there always is, but the music was so freaking gay. Me and Brian slow-danced which completely pissed off Ellen because she used to really like him and she still liked him then. So, she went off to pout with Michelle (annoying tag-along girl from our church who is friends with Cassie) and Karen (a girl that we knew from the year before). So, after the slow dance because everyone was leaving, we went into the other room where there was Pirates of the Caribbean playing on a huge screen. I was sitting next to Brian and Ellen was acting all pissy. Then Brian put his arm around me, and Ellen just got up and walked away with a huff. I went to follow her, but then I saw that she was going to the bathroom so I just let her be. Then when she came back she went to sit with Michelle. Later that night when we went back to the hotel room, the keys didn't work so me and Ellen and Brian were all outside the hotel room on the floor. Ellen was curled up in a blanket because she said that she felt sick, but I coudl tell that she was just plain pissed off. Brian was trying to talk to her and be friendly because she hadn't acted like this before, but she would barely talk to him. After we got in the hotel room, me and Ellen were talking in Spanish to one another because there was a sponsor in the room (Mrs. Goldsmith, Andrew/Frodo's mom) and we didn't want her to know what we were talking about. I don't remember much of the convo, but I kept telling her that "Tu tuviste su 'chance-o' pero no lo sacaste." She kept saying that she never had a chance, but struggling in Spanish to explain it was making us laugh a bit. That made things better, and she was pretty much over it by the next morning, though she did say stuff about how she would have bad memories associated with PotC for a while and how I had ruined her night. Atleast she was a lot more lighthearted about it...   That was Sunday, and that night we all came over to my house for a movie night. I hadn't sene Hunter since the Friday before when I had tried to ask him to Sadie, and all he did was try to make out with me. I liked Brian, but I still kind of liked Hunter despite what he did to me. Looking back, that was the stupidest thing to do -- ever. To take him back for even the little time taht I did.   LOL Brian just text-messaged me. He's not grounded anymore after we went out on Friday until 1am, and he lied to his parents about where he was and didn't answer their phone calls. My parents didn't even know that I was gone. :)   Anyways, back to movie night. Hunter came over to my house earlier, and seeing as my parents and my sister were gone, he started making out with me and I didn't really hold back. I don't remember why I didn't hold back now -- I just didn't. :/ I wish taht I could remember what was going through my head, but going on... Ellen and Brian came over, and we went out to Walgreens to drop off pictures from that weekend retreat. Then we just randomly went down Westheimer. We didn't know where we ewre going, but we just drove. Then Hunter was goign to show us where he used to live and stuff, but he forgot. So, while on Westheimer we found someone to race with. It was this black guy with a really awesome car. Brian has a kind of older Acura with a shitty engine so we got smoked each time that we were racing between stop lights. But we had less traffic in our lane so sometimes we beat him (like 1 time LOL). So we come back and we start watching American Pie, the first one, and it is all good. I am flirting a bit with Brian but mainly because he is flirting with me. Then Brian takes Ellen back to her house to go and get her stuff to spend the night. WHile they are gone, Hunter and I are making out again in the guest room and I don't resist at all. When Brian comes back I am sooo flirting with him, having pillow fights, etc. And Hunter is just sitting in a chair to the side of the room kind of ticked off. Yeah, he totally had a reason too, but I didn't see what I was doing at the time. I am a complete blond. So, it comes time for Hunter to go home, and when he walks downstairs I follow him. I was talking to him and he was pissed because he was all like "You can't just make out wiht someone and then go flirting with someone else." And then I saw what I was doing was so stupid. I apologized, but he was really mad and somehow I felt really bad about it. I said that I would stop flirting with Brian, but Hunter said that I couldn't. Ellen later told me that she and Brian were in the kitchen and thought that me and Hunter were kissing because it was so quiet over there. Then I went into the kitchen and Brian sat down on my lap, and I didn't resist at all. Then we watched the rest of the movie. When it was done, I went into my room and called Hunter while Brian and Ellen were talking in teh game room. I was trying to talk to Hunter to make up for what I did, but he was being stupid or I don't remember. Meanwhile Ellen said that Brian was asking who I was on the phone with and why it was taking so long. Then Ellen was laughing about something, and woke up my dad which really pissed him off because he had to get up in teh morning at about 5am to go on a business trip or something like that. So, she ended up not spending the night, having Brian take her home, and I going to sleep just then.   So that is what happened on Senior High gathering weekend. Next time I will probably talk/ type about when I picked up my pictures from SHG lol.   That was before he asked me out, but yeah... The saga will continue soon. I really need to talk about this because it helps me sort out my thoughts, but since Ellen prob gets sick of hearing about it (and since half of it is about her), I thought that it would be better if I could just put it in here. I don't know whether or not she checks this, but it doesn't matter either way. I try to tell things how it is, and I don't let my mind warp them into something that they are not. This is how I perceive things.

      i was in myroom and i was really mad so i locked my door and to spite me, my dd came around and unloacked it and came in my room. Then Grandma Jo wqas lying in my bed hiding under the covers and my dad was sitting on the bed next to her. This made me really mad and I asked them to get out (I was yelling). Then I started throwinga a tan trum. I tunred over the night table, and was throwing clothes everywhere. I tink that the tiem was like 3:30 or something.   Then we had to go on this plane. Oh first we were walking around this big area of country collecting clues or soemthing, but we were also collecting easter eggs. At one pont I had to climb up an umbrella that was closed and get a clue that was just like a viddeo game. The clue said something about Cho Chang commiting suicide on this one tree right behid this umbrella. Then I saw an easter egg in the entrance to this one covered corral that wasn't too far away, so I ran to get it. I picked it up and put it in my bucket and inside teh corral was teh NSync guy Lance Bass and his assistant or something. (Last night on the TV I just learned that Lance Bass tried to go into Space by couldn't get enough money) I wasnted to say that I was sorry about what happened with hisspace thing, but held back and I didn't.   Then I returned to the tree thing and my dad and my grandma were there . There mgiht have been other people there, too, but I don't remember. We had to go on a plane ride. Dunno why.   They were arranging the big shots of some company for a picture or soemthign like that, and I kept seeing this arrangement in my head. Well teh plane triend a few times to take off but didn't work. ...   We went back home to our "famr thing" - I do'nt remember it being our whole house a farm ,but ti is now. And I went tino my room to change or something. My room was a bit cleaner, but when I looked at my clock I could have sworn that it was 2:45 or somethign like that... But I rmember thinking in my dream that all that horror was only 45 mnites. THen I looked out the w indow and

      I was taking are of these kids from church. They were teh current 8th graders who are going to be entering into Freshman year. Well some of them... But then later, when iI was in side the house, they turned into Hunter from next door and some other kids. At one point, while we were inside the hosue, Hunter was washing his hands and he opened up the front of the sink and just went and sat in there! He was gettin gall wet. Then I yelled at him and i was pretty harsh and I felt bad... Later when he was going over there or maybe it was right before this incident, I thought that he was going for this one chocolate bar that was sitting on top of the counter, so I yelled at him. Then a bit later we all went outside. Theere was ome other fat lady who was taking care of the kids during the day but I just had to care for them at night. Well, when we went outside, there were lots of people buzzing around, so I went through the large gate taht we had to go through and I wakled a bit until I came to a bench and sat down. THis is when I saw some of the 8th graders like this one really tall Olivia, and a few others that I don't remember. Well I was sitting there for a bit, and when they came, they had to go around the crows to the outside of this one little fence that was perced on the side of this (we were at the top on some sort of plateau) hill. And I watched teh 8th grade girls do it and I was really worried about them. Meanwhile while I was sitting on the bench, I just realized that Brian was next to me and Ellen was sitting on the dirt floor in front of me. I realized that he was there while I was talking with Ellen, so I started leaning up against him and she started to roll her eyes. Even though I was distracted, I was able to continue teh conversation with Ellen. THen for some reason we all had to move. We went inside thsi room because we were going to watch a movie with a bunhc of other people. While we were going, Brian was a book and I was carrying him. ??? But, when we got to the room, a bucn h of people were there and pastor mike was there an he gave me a really weird look.   Oh, earlier ~ I was inside some sort of windowed area and Brian and his family was walking on the other side.

      On Saturday we had a nice Father's Day dinner at Saltgrass and went to Petsmart afterwards with my family which was... err... random.  And on Sunday the Restoration Project played for 6pm service and then a concert afterwards.  It wasn't that great of music because it was slow, so I got Cassie and Ellen to pick me up.  We went and watched Peter Pan instead which Cassie had somehow never seen.  Monday was a bum day, I guess.  I don't remember and there is nothing written on my calendar.  Tuesday morning I went to IHOP with Cassie and Lindsay which was loads of fun!  Target shopping afterwards!  At noon my mom and I left to go to Guadalajara Mex restaraunt to meet up with the Bayou Park Stables lunch group.  It was so nice to see everyone again.  Olive is still trying to sell Merlin; Joan Cantrell has cancer and is undergoing chemo but seems strong still; Sherry Wallace still has Smokey, Brown, and Spirit; Laurie Levins stopped riding with ...  gosh what is his name -- really nice black guy who is tall and skinny but doesn't take very good care of his horses ... anyways she is now riding with teh people who have Tony Rome (I think); Kate is trying to go to college again and still has her quarter horse and arabian; and Tina is still operating over at Freeman Ranch, though, with the rainy weather for the past few months she hasn't been able to do much.  Debbie couldn't make it because her car got messed up in the rainy weather that we had on the drive over, but she is still avoiding the horse world I believe after the death of Mona  (Radiant Lady Oman).  It was nice to be able to see everyone again.  Band pratice in the evening was stressful with Jennifer because she is such a diva-bitch.  All I could keep thinking to myself was "Thank God she won't be there on Sunday night."  On Wednesday I met up with Alison and we rented ROTK and got garlic bread (which was the last time ever because I found out last night that Village Seafood and Pizza closed...  not making enough money, I guess). 'Twas quite fun!  Brian got his wisdom teeth pulled on Wednesday but still insisted that we go to Cafe Adobe on Thursday where he couldn't eat anything and then I lost my contact lense in the backseat of the car.  We saw Ivon (sp?) who looks like Draco Malfoy and is freaking hott while driving down Westheimer -- random!  Warped Tour got rained out on Friday, so we made t-shirts for Sylvio.  On Sunday I slept in way late because I had been up until 4 am the last two nights working on my website.  Then on Sunday night we went and we sang at church.  Afterwards we went and got totally wasted.  Me, Cassie, Andrew, Andrew, Brian, Emily, and Ellen.  We got home at 12:45am, and her mom was soo pissed off.  Ellen puked everywhere so the house is a mess, but we cleaned it all up while her mom was at work.  I don't think that I want to do that again for a while.  Yeah, I think that my mom knows that we were drinking becasue according to Ellen her mom said that my mom brought it up.  Oh well time to lay low for a while.  Warped Tour was just okay.  I only like Yellowcard and Story of the Year.  All the rest I didn't know or didn't really care to see.  Damn it...  I'm so obsessed with Brian its sickening.

      Wow, I haven't posted in 10 days yet a shitload of stuff has happened.  Errm I guess it was on Thursday I went over to the Schindhettes to babysit (Andrew P. calls it the Shitty's becuase he couldn't hear what we were saying lol), and at like 11pm or sometime late I text messaged Brian saying how bored I was, and he called me back.  He was freaking high which pissed me off, but we talked for a bit and then when I got home I called him again and talked.  And the next night we did teh same thing...  Its so stupid because I like him so much now, but I refuse to date him because he smokes.  Maybe he'll get over it now that Karl moved away.  *wishful thinking*  Eek I have to go to lunch, so I will post the rest later!

      I am in such a good mood today.  I got up early and went to the barn with my mom.  She is being a bitch as usual, and I don't know what is going on with her.  Is she starving for attention?  Is she going to commit suicide?  Are she and dad going to get a divorce?  She makes me so mad...  If they do it will be all her fault because she is such a bitch.  He brought her flowers yesterday or the day before the evening after their big fight.  Anyways, this afternoon I bought 2 new pairs of jeans while Father's Day shopping. :)  This is so completely awesome because I can never find long jeans that fit me!  *girl stuff*  And - wow - really good news is that I am not pregnant which is probably why I am in such a good mood.  I don't remember blogging about it, but I was completely wasted, messing around with some guy that I don't know...  I don't remember much, but then I skipped a period which really scared me.  So all is good!  Eek that was stressful.  Oh!  And I changed out my belly button ring today!  I wasn't supposed to for like another couple months (just like I wasn't supposed to go swimming lol), but it worked out!  I was scared because I thought that I would get out one of the rings and not be able to get another one in, but I got it in alright. :)  I changed it to the only other one I have - the dragonfly one.  I can't wait to go buy more!  That was another thing that worried me.  If I was pregnant, not only would my mom want to kill me over that, but then also she'd find out about the belly button ring.  Double whammy and ultimate grounding for the rest of my teenage life.  She'd turn into Cassie's Nazi parents...  I talked to Brian yesterday for the first time since I was back from Germany, and he was high...  I don't know what the hell is wrong with me, but I still really like that kid.  I love talking to him and being around him, but I hate that he smokes.  We talked while I was babysitting for a bit, and then I called him back later again, and we talked for an hour and a half until like 1 am.  I wish I could smack him and tell him to stop.  It pisses me off sooo much.  Grr ~ stupid boys.  So stressful!

      Yesterday I came home from Germany (as you can see I have begun to type up what I did from day to day), and everything seemed fine.  However, in the evening when I was on the computer, my parents started yelling in their bedroom below me.  My mom was having one of her stupid you've-ruined-my-life breakdowns with my dad.  So, since I was going out with Cassie and Ellen anyways, I just decided to stay the night.  I had received gift certificates from Target so we went there, and I ended up buying $30 worth of Harry Potter stuff: trading cards with a tin, more trading cards, a little figurine set, and a HP&PoA tshirt!  That is what I do when I am stressed -- I buy things.  And then I bought Icees for Cassie and Ellen.  We went to Best Buy, too, so that Ellen could get CDs.  I tried to call my mom to figure out the date for teh Evanesence concert, but she wasn't at home and wouldn't turn on her cell.  We were really tired by then...  So we just came back to Ellen's house, and I spent the night at Ellen's because I didn't want to go home to my arguing parents.

      So last night we got on the plane, and it was sooo crazy!  Well, it was not really a night.  We all got on the plane after going through sooo many different security checkpoint things.  Cassie, Emily, and Michelle ended up having to sit away from Ellen and I because we forgot to sign up for both plane flights; we only signed up for the plane ride back from Germany.  The flight was overnight.  We left on Sunday around 2 pm and arrived in Germany this morning at 9am, and the flight was about 8 hours or so.  I tried to sleep some of the time, but it was really hard.  I sat next to the aisle, then there was Ellen, and then there was this Julie girl with our church from UT (I never figured out exactly what was going on with her the whole trip -- she just kind of seemed there for the ride or something) on the other aisle.  Everyone was just walking around during the flight, but I stayed seated for a lot of the time.  Ellen and I colored some of the coloring book pages that I brought for the ride with the new markers and crayons that I bought on Sunday morning with Cassie.  Then a bit later, Cassie came to the front and colored Beauty & the Beast pages with me too! :)

Good at a broad range of things. Enjoy debating issues, and may be into "one-up-manship". They get very excited about new ideas and projects, but may neglect the more routine aspects of life. Generally outspoken and assertive. They enjoy people and are stimulating company. Excellent ability to understand concepts and apply logic to find solutions.   ENTPs are idea people. Their perceptive abilities cause them to see possibilities everywhere. They get excited and enthusiastic about their ideas, and are able to spread their enthusiasm to others. In this way, they get the support that they need to fulfill their visions. A well-developed ENTP is extremely visionary, inventive, and enterprising.   ( from Type Logic ) "Clever" is the word that perhaps describes ENTPs best. ENTPs are usually verbally as well as cerebrally quick, and generally love to argue--both for its own sake, and to show off their often-impressive skills. They tend to have a perverse sense of humor as well, and enjoy playing devil's advocate. They sometimes confuse, even inadvertently hurt, those who don't understand or accept the concept of argument as a sport.   ENTPs are as innovative and ingenious at problem-solving as they are at verbal gymnastics; on occasion, however, they manage to outsmart themselves. This can take the form of getting found out at "sharp practice"--ENTPs have been known to cut corners without regard to the rules if it's expedient -- or simply in the collapse of an over-ambitious juggling act. Both at work and at home, ENTPs are very fond of "toys"--physical or intellectual, the more sophisticated the better. They tend to tire of these quickly, however, and move on to new ones.   ENTPs are basically optimists, but in spite of this (perhaps because of it?), they tend to become extremely petulant about small setbacks and inconveniences. (Major setbacks they tend to regard as challenges, and tackle with determin- ation.) ENTPs have little patience with those they consider wrongheaded or unintelligent, and show little restraint in demonstrating this. However, they do tend to be extremely genial, if not charming, when not being harassed by life in general.   In terms of their relationships with others, ENTPs are capable of bonding very closely and, initially, suddenly, with their loved ones. Some appear to be deceptively offhand with their nearest and dearest; others are so demonstrative that they succeed in shocking co-workers who've only seen their professional side. ENTPs are also good at acquiring friends who are as clever and entertaining as they are. Aside from those two areas, ENTPs tend to be oblivious of the rest of humanity, except as an audience -- good, bad, or potential.

      Aww I am really excited b/c Natasha just sent me this email:  they jumbled the movie too much. they tried to fit all the main pts into  *squash  Yay!  That makes me so happy!  So, I responded!  Even though I need sleep this is so much more fun!  Anyways, PoA was freaking awesome!  The acting is 100% better, all the characters have grown up, and Cuaron did a great job as the new director!  Let's just saw that Rupert Grint is...  wow -- so cute!  & the Weasley twins, Fred & George, I'm married to them.  Ellen is married to Hoobastank, Cassie is married to Trapt, & I am married to the Phelps twins.  Talk about adorable.  I don't know what is wrong with me, but I am *so* attracted to guys with red hair (that would explain my Brian problem).  And Tom Felton, who I didn't think was that cute before, has matured tremendously!  He is made to be like a bit of a pussy in this movie which ticked me off, but also he is really mean!  I can't believe that Tom hasn't read the HP books!  I thought that was kind of stupid.  He said that he didn't want to because he thought it was going to influence his acting, and he wanted to play the Draco in the script, not the written one...  Umm hello?  This is based on a book!  Cuaron did a freaking awesome job!  All of the scenery is great, Hedwig looked better & hung around more, and the Whomping Willow was really funny.  Though the plot got a bit butchered, I am very very very pleased overall!!

      Wow -- not last night, but the night before (Saturday, I think it was) was so crazy!  Ellen's parents were going to a wedding, so we figured that we would have the house to ourselves.&nbsp; Ellen had a bunch of Bailey's, Smirnoff, & whatever so we were just going to have a mini-party.&nbsp; We went to Best Buy and bought Ellen's TV that she has been wanting forever even though her parents said no.&nbsp; Brian was supposed to come and hang out with us, but I didn't call him earlier enough evidentally, so ...&nbsp; he was with Carl.&nbsp; Grrr...&nbsp; Yeah, I know what they were doing which pisses me off so much.&nbsp; But Brian came over with Carl for a bit before he had to go golfing with his dad which was nice of him.&nbsp; Kind of.&nbsp; Cassie and Ellen said that Carl and Brian were being mean which I can kind of see, but I am a bit biased if I do say so myself.&nbsp; Carl really scares me though -- I tried to talk to him a bit, but he just scares me!  After they left we went to Maggie Moos, but I just slept in the back seat of the car most of the time.&nbsp; I was really tired after eating 3 pieces of pizza -- I know it sounds weird, but I was.&nbsp; Also, I was a bit ticked at Brian for having smoked and just wanted to think about it to myself, but I have to get over it...&nbsp; He'll grow out of it eventually. *wishful thinking*  So, we're in Ellen's room watching  Identity , and her parents come home.&nbsp; They were so pissed off that she bought the TV that they kicked me and Cassie out of the house.&nbsp; They are making Ellen return the TV, they threatened to take away her car, and they made her quit her job.&nbsp; Eeek she just called me, and they just returned it.&nbsp; They haven't given her the money for it.&nbsp; Stupid bitch.&nbsp; Its not really her dad just her mom.&nbsp; And even Bryce's mom was like "Why is Ellen's mom being such a bitch?"&nbsp; haha  So me and Cassie went back to Cassie's house and talked to her parents and get her stuff to spend the night at my house.&nbsp; We went to my house, watched the end of Moulin Rouge which is so sad and so romantic. *sigh*&nbsp; Then Cassie had Hercules so we watched that and drank Red Bull...&nbsp; Talk about major hyperness -- so we had a punching match and tried to beat the crap out of eachother.&nbsp; Then we read Cosmo and painted our nails while watching Underworld.&nbsp; I don't know if it was before or after that, but we went outside and just walked around my neighborhood.&nbsp; I talked about Brian and she talked about Michael & Jeremy.&nbsp; Boys.&nbsp; In the cliche words of wise Cassie, "You can't live with them.&nbsp; You can't live without them." ;)  Cassie left early in the morning because she is a bum, but yeah. :)&nbsp; That is about it.&nbsp; Fun, eh?

      Wow -- I am so completely giddy... I might have just made a huge mistake, but I'm so incredibly head over heels that I don't care.  I think that I am in love with Brian.  We went to see Anchorman tonight, and we watched the whole movie which I enjoyed a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Making out at the movies is fun, but I think that it is more fun to actually watch.&nbsp; I mean, you paid for it, right?&nbsp; I was just leaning my head on his shoulder, and he held my hand.&nbsp; Talk about content. :)  Then we went to Sonic, and I thought that I saw the guy that I turned down for homecoming.&nbsp; When we went back to my house, he went to kiss me goodbye...&nbsp; and it didn't stop...&nbsp; I was nervous that my dad was going to look out the window (Brian's windows are tinted but I was still scared) , so we went over to the Beck parking lot for a bit.&nbsp; I just laid in his arms in the back of his car for like 30 minutes, and he is going to be in so much trouble because he was so completely late to come back home.  And OMG he said that he loved me.&nbsp; I don't know how seriously to take it because after I talked to Cassie she didn't seem so thrilled.&nbsp; I think that he was serious, but I don't know.&nbsp; All that I know is that tonight was...&nbsp; magical...&nbsp; There is no other word.  OMG I am so in love with this boy.&nbsp; Help me!&nbsp; Help me!
