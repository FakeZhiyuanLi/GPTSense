       I've been very busy lately. Between my girl life (people think I'm a stalker >.>), bicycle mechanics, and other things, I haven't had the slightest bit of time to even watch TV.   YaBBHost has been out for about.. Two days now. I haven't exactly been advertising, but this is ridiculous! The message board industry is already filled with several quality message board providers. I need to find a way to promote my business, as well as offer good quality service. The person I hired to manage all the support requests hasn't even showed up for work! (Well, hasn't even made an account on the support forum) so he's fired as far as I'm concerned. I'm going to try and expand my "horizon" and offer more services, such as portals, shoutboxes, and other things.   My good friend The Ar'tak and I have been brainstorming about a new service, a banner exchange. I'm almost positive that this will be a success. We have good quality hosting and people will jump at the chance to promote their site for free. Hopefully it will be a decent way for The Ar'tak and I to promote our other sites as well.  Well, I have a lot of work ahead of me. I'm also working on building one awesome bike out of three crappy bikes. That's a totally different subject though.  peace out.

       Today was rainy. Zach came over right after I snapped one of the shifter cables for my bike. My bike was at about a fourth of it's full power. Oh well. He and I rode up to a new coffee shop and had lunch. They had some good food for cheap.   Then, we did a lot more bike riding. Went down to my grandma's house and back. Back at my house I tuned my bike. Then the girl I've been stalking (teehee) was walking around. Zach wanted to get a good look of her, and he did. We just blew past her about every five minutes. Then Zach's chain came off (he doesn't know how to ride a bike ;-)) like right in front of her. That was kinda.. Awkward.   Then on the ride back I almost fell about five feet away from her. (He and I were going at insane speeds, even though I only had 7 of 21 gears.) That would have been not only bloody painful, but embarassing.  When I got home I concentrated all my work on an afternoon nap. :P After that I worked on YaBBHost and finally got it finished. You can check it out at  urlLink http://yabbhost.tk  (Link may not work yet, try  urlLink http://dhost.info/yabbhost )  I also got an internet accelerator from my Internet Service Provider. The internet now loads about three times faster. I'm happy, it's not bad for $1.50  I can't wait to get my bike back to Walmart to have them fix it. Then I'll give Zach a lesson in speed that he won't forget. :-D

       Today I spent mostly either (A) programming YaBBHost or (B) riding my new bike. I'll start with the programming first.  YaBBHost is looking very promising. For anyone who doesn't know, YaBB is one of the best message board software around. I am working on rewriting a lot of their code. They made lots of errors, in the sense their layout isn't too great. I am currently in the process of fixing that though. So, I woke up at 1pm today and the first thing I did was started coding. I'm about fifty percent done so far.   Every once in awhile I'd take a break and go for two hour bike rides with Josh. His new house is really nice, but he found out today the landlord wouldn't be fixing anything, so they couldn't move in there. Now he's really upset because they just got finished unpacking, and they're looking for a new house. They found one, but he doesn't really want to move in because there'd be people living on the floor above them.   My bike is really significant. It stands out among all the others. In fact I've never seen a bike like it around Streator. It's a really powerful bike too. It's definately made for racing. It handles extremely awesome. I can turn a corner and go as long as I want and the bike still holds strong, with a good tight feel. It also looks incredible. The flames are just spactacular. It's really as if the bike is really on fire.   Gmail is so awesome. If you haven't heard, it's "A Google Approach to Email" as said on their site. Check it out  urlLink here!  Find a friend that has it and get an invite off them. It's the only way you can sign up so far. It's so fast, and they give you  one gigabyte  of storage space. You'll never have to delete an email again! Their interface is also very userfriendly, and the ads are at a mimimum! I also like their Archiving function and their search function. You can easily search through email.  FireB0rn. FireB0rn. FireB0rn. Where do I begin? It's now fully into it's 1st Anniversary celebration with 1st Anniversary templates and 1st Anniversary images. I'm currently focusing on one  major  template. It's gonna be loaded. It's actually, extremely basic. It's the first ever color scheme and layout ever used by the original FireB0rn, FireB0rn.Com. I'm dubbing it FireB0rn: First Anniversary. I think it will be a big hit for the basic template fans.  Well, I'm off to get some sleep. Zach's coming over tomarrow and he and I are going to be riding bikes all day. We're going to go to a lot of places. My grandma's house, Ali's house, lots of places.
