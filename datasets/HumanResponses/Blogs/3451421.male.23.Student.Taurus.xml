      Week1-3  1.	What did you experience uploading your sites to unix?  2.	What are some of the global impacts of being able to create a homepage on the Internet?  3.	Where is the technological city state and why is it refereed to as the 21st century fortress city?  Singapore is the new technological city state. It is refered to this because it is considered an intelligent island. It is completely enclosed and very strict. Everybody watches everything they do, under one domain. 4.	What is right or wrong about machines influence on our lives? Machines have been influencing our lives since the first caveman took a stick and hit a stone with it. Our ability to build and use technology is part of our nature. However, what happens when this technology begins to influence us. We shuold not be influenced by these machines because who will be in power, us or the machines. We should use machines for influence, such as television ads, but should not let the machine itself inluence our life. 5.	E-mail your web address of the page you worked on today to three other people in the class (see group for e-mail addresses). When you have received three other student's websites write a few paragraphs on what the person is telling us with their website.  The first blogger I went to was Meghan Breedlove’s. It is apparent at the beginning that it is most likely a female’s site, due to the color, pink. She enjoys shopping running, and going out. It is also apparent that she likes most kinds of music, as well as watching movies. The next blogger I went to was Argenis Rodriguez. He enjoys many activities that are active and sporty. He seems to enjoy sci-fi movies as well as comedy movies, but he deffinetely didn’t like robocop 3. I liked the color he used on his blogger. I like the color scheme and the circles.  6.	In the View my complete profile area of your blogger fill in some of your interests. Refresh your page and link to someone with your similar interests, which are linked from your profile.  I clicked on my link for the book “The Dark Tower”. Another blogger that came was a girl named Elizabeth. She is feom an english speaking country not in  the U.S., but says she would be democratic if she was an american. She seems very liberal. If I had to guess I would say she is from canada or england, due to some of the literature she choose as her favorite books as well as her liberal stance. 7.	Read the article about the Baghdad blogger and write a couple of paragraphs on how Salam Pax saw his blog and how others, especially in the Western Media saw his blog. What would you see as the similairty or differences between a blog and an 'embedded reporter' with a United States organisation such as CNN news and which would you believe would be giving a true report of fact or which would be giving a reportage that was politcally or motivated by the writer's worldview? You may want to compare what Salam Pax says with what this reporter who was an "embedded reporter" with NBC has to say. Salam Pax saw his blog as a threat. He talks so much and so strongly about bieng fearful of  “Mr. Site killer”. But what this threat comes from is why it was so important. The fact that Pax was speaking his mind in a country where this is not a good thing. People saw this blog as a representation of how all people felt in Baghdad. This is misrepresenting because he is only one man and therfore one point of view.  	This is similar to an embeded reporter in that it is an account. It is a point of view, expressed through facts and forms one man holds true. A major difference is that an embeded reporter will give a point of view, but using the facts and forms consistant with the target audience, not neccesarily his own.

      Week 1-1  Week 1-1: Name as many members of your class as you can remember.  	Meagan, Sammy, Justin, Katherine, Noel, Colin, Ann Marie,   Week 1-2: Write a paragraph on what you see as communicating on the Internet.  	Communicating on the internet can take many forms. The one people are most familiar with is E-mail. Most everybody has an e-mail addres nowadays and people use them often. Also, people use chat rooms or instant messangers to commuicate in real time over the internet. This has been beneficial not only to the public sector but the private as well. People also communicte over the interenet by message boards and weblogs. These can provide anything from feedback on a website to discussion and debate. I feel that these three or four instances cover the msjority of communication on the internet.

       what is your 'blogger' address? 	http://com465milin.blogspot.com/   Write a couple of sentences on each of these new tensions that technology brings to society.  Centralization vs. Fragmentation= I feel that new technology causes centralization. People of different backgrounds are coming together to work and improve things. A holistic perspective vs. Specialized knowledge=  New technology  creates a holistic perspective by making new knowledge available to all. People then receive a more holistic perspective on things. Too much information vs. Too little information= Technology makes so much informtion available that there is too much information to sift through to try to find what you want. Leadership vs. Fellowship= technology causes fellowship among people because people feel a sense of community in new technologies with the others that use it Worker isoliation/alientation vs. Community connections= Technology is isolating the worker of today. With all the new mobile technology, people don’t have a sense of an office community as in the past. Sharing vs. Withholding access to information= Information "filters" vs. Disintermediation (Removing the middleman. The term is a popular buzzword used to describe many Internet -based businesses that use the World Wide Web to sell products directly to customers rather than going through traditional retail channels. By eliminating the middlemen, companies can sell their products cheaper and faster. Source: http://www.webopedia.com) = removing the middle man can be good for the consumer in terms of cost, but what about all the jobs these middlemen have. Are they no longer employed because of the act of disintermediation. Public intervention vs. Private decisionmaking= technology has created an atmostphere of public intervention. The public can now band together using technology to get stuff done. Which cities are America's Most Wired Cities?  San francisco is the most wired city at 61%  Which cities are the world's Most Wired Cities?  Singapore?  What are the next three largest users of the Internet after English speaking people.       Chinese, japanese, spanish  What Arab country uses the Internet the most?         United Arab Emerites  'Future City' What does the author say will be the affect the future city will have on the individual? What do you think the affect the future city will have on the individual?   The author says that the individual will have many constraints.  He also says that people will need to be more like a program in a computer, doing there specific part. They drive home the point that freedoms will be limited. I feel like after the inception of this future city, the concept of individual will be lost. They seem to overlook the basic human desire of free will. If they tried this I feel that they would have problems.

      Journal June15  1)	Electronic communities face many challenges today. First, it is hard to create a sense of community on-line. The technology used must be simple but not mundane. People must want to work here. It is also tough because it is hard to know who you are exaclty talking to in some situations. The lack of emotion and voice tone can also lead to many mistakes or problems. 2)	Discussion cahnged from normal talk to a kind of “can’t believe it” sort of thing. People were discussion just the facts, what had happened and were. Only the beginning of terrorist mention. Next, the rumors begin, you begin to see a lot of “ I heard” or “I bet”. This is showing the rumor factor in full gear. Also, people begin passing judgement before any real info is available. 3)	Moderated chat rooms are bieng watched over, either by a person or program. Inmediated means that anyhting goes and that there are no people or programs monitering the chat room. 4)	Emotions are a symbolic part of communication because we base what we say on the reactions we project to receive. Unfortunetely, this is no t always the case and people say things expecting one emotion and get another. 5)	Through the use of emoticons and things of that nature, computers reintroduce oral charcteristics through the things lie  happy, sad, :-O mad, etc.

      Journal, June 14  2) :-( frown, :-) smile, :'( crying, {{{{{}}}} hugs,    big freakin grin,   evil grin,   big grin,   small grin. Gimee a ^5 because I got a c[[]] ( Give me a high five because I have a pint of beer. 3) Hypertestual thinkng is unnatural becaseu we make sense of our world through symbols. The symbols used in hypertext are different to understand. 4) Project Xanadu is important because it is taking hypertext and making it more useful. It is rearangeing programs, such as word proccesesors in a way that is easier and more like the way we wright. 5) a. he did this to give his page a diferent feel each time it is loaded, so that the reader will see different pictures and stay interested.      b. The color of the sky was like a color tv tuned to a blank channlel, so I guess black.      c.The levitating tv’s line the streets anf then turn on all at once, lightnig up the fronts of lawns and houses.      d. The screen moves away to expose a picture. Each time you click the tv shades over and the mouse will reveal a new picture.       e.  This story is about Borris and Natasha and a trip on a hot air ballon. There is also mention of some kind disjointedness between their ears and bodies because of the hieght they reach. 7) on website. 8) Hypertextual fiction is facing many issues. First, link problems could casue huge holes on the story. Also, there is a problem with navagability. If a person cannot gain access to certain parts of the story, there is a big problem. 9) Identities are constructed on-line, to help describe who we are, or who we want to be. On-line identities usally posses some ideal held on to by the creator. These ideals are exported and reflected in their on-line personna.

      Journal june 10  1.	The question that with communication on the internet th e individuals identity is not clear can be answered by refering to MUD’s and MOO’s mostly. Of course in your IRC’s you are not going to always know who you are talking to but possible to get a sense of that person based on what IRC they are in and what they are saying. This is harder on a MUD or MOO. The communication on these sites is based on a fantasy world created by the players themselves. That means that the peole stop bieng themselves and begin a character. This charater is called an “avatar”. This avatar is a person’s character which has many of the qualities that we understand such as gender, age, and race. The problem is that in this fantasy world, that is what it is , fantasy. There is no way to tell who the individual is, were they are from , or their personality. MOO’s are a great place for individuals to become lost because they can manipulate the envirnment around the MOO. This manipulation allows them to create a place or object within the MOO, that can be manipulatee by the other players. Again, this is a fantay world so that it is impossible to tell what or who the person is or what they like. 2.	An IRC is an internet relay chat. It consists of many sperate networks of IRC servers. Once you are connected to an IRC server, you can join channels to direct what it is you want to discuss. Conversations can be public or private and that depends on who you want to see the document, one person or lots of people. 3.	MUD’s stand for multiple user dialogs. These MUD’s are used for people that want to play almost a sort of role playing. People create characters and then are able to create envirnments through the site. A major difference is that people can work on these sites without shutting them down (unlike IRC”S) to create thes envirnments. 4.	The first new paradigm shift that is discussed is the shift from print to computerization. This brings up a durability issue on the time a document will last in cyberspace. An interesting side note is that Stephen King has recently published an on-line book. 5.	The purpose of examining on-line communication is to sese if there is a new way of communication emerging, and how this will effect us. An example of this would be the relatively new idea of “netiquette” that emerged in the late 80’s. 6.	A reader is an importatn prt of the chatroom because they decide what is going on. An author may write something, and intend it to be interpreted in a certain way. This interpretation is importatn because it will decide aht you have said.

      Journal 1.	proper words will help because if you use common words, related to your site, that people use commonly. These words and the combonation of words make a match that is unique to your site. Getting more of the words in your page will make it a higher position in the display of websites matching the key word. 2.	on e-zine 3.	on e-zine 4.	Writing for the web should be adjusted to help it’s effectiveness on the web. Web writing should be clear and concise, as well as short and sweet. Font and color also play a big part in web writing. A clear font and contrast of colors helps web writing be viewed and understood better. 5.	Fair use responds to the use of copywritten material for the use of education. This falls under the media. The media is allowed to use and say copywritten things in certain circumstances. This alows us to be able to report on cooperations with copywritten names, otherwise, when the news did a report about something and said a copywriten name, they won’t get sued under copywritten laws. 6.	Each slash represents a different part of a website. Each one is a different website in and of itself, but it is related to the home page, that mneans that the homepage is braod and these slashes act as way to define the site on narrower terms. 7.	The main problem with the acedemic writng on the internet is that most popele don’t use the inverted pyramid. This means that the conclusions have to come first. People don’t want to sift through all sorts of stufff to find the conclusions, they want them first because they most likely know all the other stuff on the page, the conlcusion is the bases of the paper and should be first.

      1.	The difference between jpeg and gif is a matter of what you are trying to do. If you are using a photo or picture with a lot of color fields as well as some blending of colors, jpeg will be the best bet. If you are going to save simpler things gif is better.  2.	Is gif legal or not? This is a tough question because thetre are many factors involved.  No one will be prosecuted for using gif but it’s partners like tiff are going to be much more srutinized. 3.	on my zine, www.albany.edu/~pm0115/zine.htm 4.	a) I feel like I have addreseed most of the points here, especailly numbers 1 and 14, you told us those exclusively. b) I havbe many priority accesability errors. The main function of these is to tell me things to make my website better. For example, I need a table summary.  Another thing is that my links aren’t exactly clear in were they are taking someone. Also, my table is apparently not formatted well. c) This is a good thing, it helped me understand what’s goin on woth my page.

      1.	Web sites may be optimized by taking things away that are unneccesary. These unneccesary items can jumnle up a page, causing it to load slowly and/or causing to much confusion about the different parts of the website. 2.	a)This image communicatews through color, model, and eyecontact. It stimulates many senses at once. b) The text puts a context to the image. Without this context, the picture could mean a number of things to a number of people. This text helps push it in a direction. c) Together they both put a visual sense to work. Both the image and text in tandom create a feeling that the artist was trying to convey. 3. the duality addresses the hyper textual formate that is readabl;e by computers, now, there are som many specail fonts and what not that peopleare not binegf able to red it,causing a lot of confusion. 4. The semantic web will revolutionize the world wide web. IT will help web pages be read by compueters and set up for humans. Today, web pages are made for humans to read, not computers, so the semantic web will help eveyone in the long run. 5. This ezine is about artists and poems. Obviosuly it is a little dark but that is okay, whatever floats your boat.

      11.	I would like my ezine to have a table at the beginning, with dark colors and links to all the other parts. 12.	The purpose oof the e-zine will to be to discuss King’s works and how they affected us. 13.	I would like all Stephen King fans to read this zine, as well as fans of literature in general. 14.	I would like to cover most, if not all aspects of his writing, fiction, non-fictionand his writng done under psuedoname. 15.	I hope to encourage people to read more King if they haven’t already. 16.	I would publish about once a month in order to keep changing the artiucles. Also, I would publish a specail article if King came out with a new book.

      Journal 2-3  1.	There are many terms and conditions of the statement free. You must agree not to change, mopdify or recreate the code found toproduce these items. You are also prohibited from selling, renting or distrubting these things. Thses rules are put in the terms of agreement and most people just go right over them, causing problems later. 2.	These images are available for all to use as long as credit is given to Lisa Konrad, and that the animation is a link back to this site. 3.	The clipart in this website is completely free, with no copyright restrictions. The auther gives permission to use and change her work for your use. 4.	This site is like the first. Permissoin for use is granted but one cannot sell, change or modify the images without the expressed permission of the author. Also, they would like a link back to the page. 5.	The images on this site probably are not free. I could not find a terms of use, but the pictures all have a © which makes them property of someone else, and therefor others are not allowed to use it without permission. 6.	 "If it doesn't have a copyright notice, it's not copyrighted." This myth is about the berne copywrite invention. Most things that aren’t given credit are copywriten. "If I don't charge for it, it's not a violation." This is wrong because it could still damge the “sellability” of the object in question. "If it's posted to Usenet it's in the public domain." Nothing is in the public domain unless the author says it is. My posting was just fair use!" This is reserved for journalists and educators. It gets fishy when you start jepordizing others profitability. "If you don't defend your copyright you lose it." -- "Somebody has that name copyrighted!" This refers to the fact that names and small titles can’t be copywriten, however one must be carful of trademarks. "If I make up my own stories, but base them on another work, my new work belongs to me."  Derivative works are still considered copywrite infringement. "They can't get me, defendants in court have powerful rights!" This is covered in civil court, not criminal so there is no innocent untill proven guilty. "Oh, so copyright violation isn't a crime or anything?" It isn’t uintil you make money from it, then it could be a felony."It doesn't hurt anybody -- in fact it's free advertising." It is up to the owner of the copywriten work to decide weather or not this is free advertisng or if he wants to advertise at all. "They e-mailed me a copy, so I can post it." To have a copy of something is not the same as having copywrite. You can still only use this if the author says so. 7.	The main principles of the copyleft movement is to make derivative work s of other things alright to do. They believe that programs can be constatnly improved, and these improvements used by all to use the better program.  8.	Lynx is an operating system that is open source. This means that it is free and created by many authors, so that there is less problems. Also, it is very reliable due to all the people working to improve it. 9.	My e-zine will be on Stephen King’s works of literature. 10.	King’s court will be the name of my e-zine

      Journal 2-1  1.	I feel that making websites is a pain in the kester. There are som many things that can go wrong and I think that neuage did a great job going around to help everyone. This art, like any other, requires practice and expertise, niether of which I posses. However learning these tools, though aggrevating as all heaven, is a good skill to know. I feel that learninig these basic skills will open new doors for me as well as to help persuade me to like and use computers a little more. 2.	my website picture is http://www.albany.edu/~pm0115/pat's%20pic.bmp .

However, older regimes are still using it. http://www.communitytechnology.org/aspden/aspden_talk.html This site talks about how the internet is affecting social polotics. Some key issues are who is on, impact on existing structures and new ways of expression.  2.	This is a poem reffering to the ruins of some building that is a parralell to the soul.
