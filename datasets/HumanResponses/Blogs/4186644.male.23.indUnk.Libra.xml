      So its Tuesday morning and Im here at work doing absolutely nothing but thinking of what  my official first entry should be for my blog.  What just so happens to spring into my mind? The approaching winter swell, thats what.  Recolections of days past and moments permanently burned into my minds eye.  Teh kind of memories that enable thought and the five senses to work together for one hell of a day dream. including glassy water, the light mist and raindrops of a hawaiian winter and barreling, rideable surf. You see reader, I have an obsession. An obsession with surfing these warm hawaiian waters and the drug called Stoke. The more stoke you taste, the more clarity and simplicity you add to your life. Hmmm, simplicity by adding more? You bet you sweet ass. I know its not very Tao of JKD to say so, but sorry Mr. Bruce Lee, this is one application where your rules do not apply, well at least in this sense.  But I digress, lets get back on topic.  Looking out side I see variable rain. Slow, purposfull fatty drops. Sheer, speeding, thin drops. You name it. Thats Hawaii rain for you. If you dont like it, just wait 10 minutes. One thing always remains constant though, well at least to me. Its always warmer than it looks. All my life Ive lived here, 23 years (nobody likes you when your 23 BTW, [/life] ), And every time I can remember playing in this falling liquid I recall it bieng warm and inviting.  Refreshing and pleasent mind you, its not like God's Urine kind of warm! Now rewind to one of my greatest days out in the water............./squigly dream sequence lines.blurr and fade..............LOL  ....  It was a rainy september morning, about 530AHT (am hawaiian time) . The previous days poundings still rippled fresh in my mind. So did the drunken sotries of heavy water that lulled me to sleep that night. Then that haunting wave. The one that hugged me tight and wouldnt send me skipping out of her love tube till she was satisfied. My moment of zen. The drug that calls many young men from their comfortable beds on a rainy saturday morning, Stoke. Gotta get my stoke on. I hop out of bed already dressed for the ocassion. (Who doesnt sleep in their board shorts? Its the perfect PJ's. ) And procedd to the bathroom. Ritual morning piss, brushing of teeth and sweeping out the sand from last nights shower before mom gets up and whoops my ass. Too easy. Back to the room, and it is time to sit and think, real, real hard. Transportation was an issue back then so planning the perfect bus route to expedite our journey is a must. Obviously were headed to the north shore, bur its how we get there that would determine the supplies we would have available to us that day, out at the bay (Waimea), where the nearest lunch wagon or bathroom is football fields away from you up hill in white sand. You will want to travel light by nature as a surfer but this beach will change your mind after a few sessions.  The deciding moment and sometimes the most  exciting part is calling up the surf report. Now me and the boys usually call the Billabong Surf Hotline (808.922.2664) to get the scoops on the  days forecast but that doesnt usually come out for today until 7ish, and on this day that just wouldnt do. Gotta call national to get the bouy readings. ..............And boy was i glad I did.  I put out the APB and slowly, all around central OAHU, at 545AHT people like me were emerging from their houses with a bourd under their arm and huge permanent smiles that cut through the rain and made the know nots uneasy. Its the drug, I swear by it. And for the bus stop we made.  Z:\My memoirs\speed through the boring bus ride sequence.doc ...... The bus ride was only interesting as we rounded the bend towards the bay. It climbs up the side of this mountain ledge and gives the prospect stoke junkie a perfect glimpse of the formation, sections, bottom conditions, scramble distance, true size and clarity of the water were about to  slaughter.  A little tease if you will. And the bus, at 630AHT is going to erupt. People falling back in their seats after the glimpse passes displaying a face of euphoria, some looked like they were recovering from the best feeling of lives. It is the face of STOKE! I cant describe what really goes through your mind during a moment like this (well actually I can, but will save this for a later entry) , but who feels it, knows it.  There is nothing like that feeling, anywhere. Period. Next stop. Waimea Bay, Oahu, Hawaii. 635AHt 1999.  We hop off the bus. Its so much warmer as we exit the air conditioned bus. The roads are steaming from a previous rain let. There was more rain on the way, but who cares when your in the water anyway? And besides, the rain keeps the water GLASSY. We walk off the asphalt, slippers squeaking and head for the first sight of sand to the left of the bay, where the famous rock that we spend all of the flat (no surf) summer jumping off and bombing. The side of the bay that gets sick and celestially holow. And as we take our slippers off and trod up the little sandy hill restricting our view of the shore break we break the crest and see ..........Heaven. Liquid Eden.  Now its about a good 100 yards streight down to the waters edge, but we were going left, way left. Easily double the distance. None of us ran our football practices with that much earnst and energy. But that day, 200 yards seemed like 10 feet. We were there in a flash. We wanted to be the first in the water that day ( and we were ) but you have to study your conditions.  It would be most unwise to enter the water with out learning her rythem for that day, or her moods, or her tantrums. Yes, she plays with an agenda. Stoke began running through our viens as we watched a killer set roll in. Flawless, un ridden double overhead tubes, sucking twice high and foldinig over a winter perfected sand bar making barrels two cars wide in 2 feet of water. This, reader, is your daily moment of clarity. Sitting down in the morning air, light drizzle, staring at your playground to be.  I take off my shirt adn as usual am the first one in. I start to paddle. Blood and stoke in a unique harmony with adrenalin and determination. I duck the first wave of a set and come out her back, surface and continue scratching water. I make it out in to the line up and I decide to sit on my board and look back to gain my bearings. Im sitting pretty and the set ends. But here she comes again with a rougue peak comming my way.  The rain picks up a little. Dotting the glass all around me. Funny feeling bieng in a cool ocean with warm water sprinkling all over you.  I turn around and start stroking into position. I look at the boys and they are on their feet, towells held over each others head and their shouting but the approaching wall behind me is sucking hard and that IS ALL I CAN HEAR. I feel hertouch the back of my foot and it has begun. The dance. She and I.  I paddle. She accepts me with a scooping motion, sucking me to the top of her face and sending me streaking, streight down, skipping on her smooth body. I crank my board left and heave roosts of water as i cut through the water and line up for the intimate moment. The barrel. I speed left, trimming hard. Maintaining a line there is pretty easy once you learn her timing. I pass everyone on the beach like a blur, 50 yards away they are a cheering blur. The time has come. The water in front of me stretches. I see the sand beneath me in just inches of water, the wall was dark blue and thick. I glance up and see her lip pitch out, 10 feet to my right it closes around me with a huge undescribable echo. I whiz through her and look up at the rising sun throgh her light blue lip, and squiggly freinds jumping up and down, ripping their own shirts off. Then in a flash, shes gone. Leaving me to dip out of a ghost, only to resurface out of her back and paddle back for position and join the boys in the line up. This wave would be eaten or fed to us all day long.  I would never forget it. Im addicted.   So reader, as I sit here at work, looking out the window at the falling, warm rain. This is what I think of. Welcome to my Blog.
