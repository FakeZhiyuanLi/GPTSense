      Yippie the day is almost over ~ i am so glad i only have 1hr and half left of work. even though i have not done much, i guess i better do something tomorrow or i will be behind in my work. i guess i have the summer time blues i rather be out and about doing fun summer stuff instead of being stuck inside having to work. I miss being a kid ~ sleeping late and doing hardly anyting all day long, it was fun being a kid. and when we were kids we could not wait to grow up. if i could only do it again i would sleep more and have a lot more fun being a kid and not wanting to grow up so darn fast. well i am just wasting time till break i do need to get something done before break so hope everyone out there is having a good day ~

						   I am happy that it is FRIDAY ~ BUT I still have to work tomorrow so that kinda stinks but hopefully I get caught up on my work but I really doubt it, I am thinking that since I am not really going to get caught up I should just stay home and not come into work but then I think about the over time so that makes me want to come in tomorrow, also my sister is going to be here tonight so I kinda want to stay home tomorrow incase she wants to do something. I guess I will decide before I leave tonight.

						   I am so happy it is Friday ~ i am so ready for this three day weekend!!!!! i get to sleep in and get some rest. last night i cooked dinner for my friends and it went really well except when it came to make the gravy it was not to bad but it was nothing like what my mom makes. i need to practice more on the gravy. but everything came out pretty good. next time i think i will make an easier meal for everyone. when i get off of work today i am going to go and pick up my 5 yr old cousin to stay the night with us tonight. thats going to be lots of fun. i don't know what all we are going to do but i did think about taking her out to eat and just going out and messing around and maybe that will wear her out so when we get home she will go to bed pretty easy. well its time to get to work and get this day over with.

						   I am so sleepy i just wanted to stay home and sleep somemore. and i can't go home and take a nap like i usually do i have company coming over cause its my turn to make dinner. me and my two friends brandie and melissa came up with a plan to take turns cooking and everyone come to that persons house for dinner. melissa made something tuesday i can't remember what she called it but it was really good. and tonight is my turn i am making everyone chicken fried steak and all the good stuff to go with it. i need to clean up a little before they come over. i guess i should have done that yesterday but i went to church then went over to my aunts house and helped her shave her dog, that was the biggest mess i had dog hair all over me YUK. and i did not get home to late. i really hope i get in bed before 10 tonight but i doubt that will happen but i am really wanting to. i need to get some sleep before friday because my 5 yr old cousin is staying the night with me so i need my energy for her. she will keep me going. lets all hope that this day goes by really really fast.
