      the exercise was about shadowing some international executive (foreigner) dealing with some kind of international business and observe his/her activities for 4 hours and coax that person for lunch or a cup of coffee.  we were six of us who started from the college--yayati,siddharth,prianka,sonali,bhavana and me and got a lift from the HDFC ATM near the campus in an army truck.the enthusiasm was on its peak and we were determined to do something really great today. "managed" to get into an army truck which is usually very difficult..got lift uptil RTO and then walked for around 5 or 6 minutes and separated in groups of 3 each;my group consisting of yayati,bhavana and me. earlier we had a plan to go to some five star hotel like blue diamond or le meridien. on the way we got a lift and coincidently that guy was yayati's relative.he suggested us to go to Koregaon park where he said the probablity of finding a foreigner is more. he dropped us at koregaon park in front of the German Bakery.  there started the real quest of finding some foreigner and that too some international business executive. there were many foreigners who were sitting inside the bakery and we decided to talk to one of the guy who seemed to be a bit decent(unlike others who were looking more like hippis)..though it was sounding a bit awkward to talk to some guy like this but i managed to explain him the situation.he quickly called up one of his friends who was dealing with international business(marbles)..we talked to him but unfortunately couldnt pursue her to get what we wanted. then that guy suggested us to some place near the Osho ashram, where we were unfortunate again.found one american guy on the way and i just stopped him on the way and explained the situation.he was dealing with some interantional business but was busy with some work so refused to help us.we went inside the osho ashram, but didnt find any body there too. then we went to the Godrej millenium building where we went to companies like TCS,Reliance,Japan Life insurance,S1 but was in vain. then we moved to Zensar and Eureka Forbes which was just nearby. we decided to move to Satyam after that and after getting refusals from everywhere decided to eat vada pao in some shop.  after coming from there and attending Kamath sir's lecture we came to know the loophole in our approach.the one thing which i learnt from his lecture was to get help from anybody always make that person in front of u feel important.  this experience was indeed something which will always remain as  one of the most memorable moments of my life.  hope to do another business exercise in future soon and this time with SUCCESS.

      we had a holiday yesterday so planned to go for TROY....my friend Atul and i went to the Mc Donalds to have a burger and then to Crossword to have a glance on the books...then we returned home and washed our clothes and at 11 o clock we re in the E square for the movie... we enjoyed the movie and in a good mood we re walking on the street at 2 am thinking about our next day in the college...we reached our flat and knocked the door,knocked it again and again and again ....and hell!!!!!!!!!  nobody was opening the dooor..we kept on banging on the door but to our dismay it was useless..we threw stones through the window but our dumb room mates were snoring...then we decided to go to some gurudwara which was 2 km from my flat near the college..we went there too but nobody opened the door...then we went to a temple 1.5 km from there and slept for around 30 minutes under the open sky...finally we decided to go to the flat again at 5 am in themorning and after knocking for around 15 minutes or so, one of our great roommates opened the door and eventually we slept..  that was a horrible experience......

      yesterday was the last day of my orientation program and believe it was like ending of a punishment in a jail....we had to go to college 7 days a week starting from 7.30 in the morning to 8 or 8.30 in the evening ..then so many presentation, assignments, reports, tests and many other things....we didnt get time to sleep, eat and even go to the toilet(i m not  joking!!)...  it was so rigrous and grilling for me perhaps because i m not used to of waking up at 6.30 am in the morning and working so much the whole day.but i ve to get accustomed to such environment coz things are even more difficult in the corporate world, where i ll be working 2 years from now...(though i dont  know about tomorrow!!)  it was a great feeling for all of us when the student council members announced the end of the orientation program and declared 3rd july as our sports day ...we literally shouted,whistled and clapped for this announcement....enjoyed alot on 3rd july and now again we ve to pull up our socks for our regular classes from tomorrow.  i wish   i ll do much better in my regular classes as i feel i m kinda accustomed to the tough environment we r gonna face in future...  cheeers
