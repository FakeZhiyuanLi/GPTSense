       9/11    I've been watching various television stations covering the 9/11 tragedy of last year, and I have to say that alot of the images shown, especially the twin towers on fire, still manages to bring out a tear or two from me. The thought of the innocent people trapped in the towers, and just being caught by surprise by the attack, always chokes me up. Its a horrible dipiction of what man can do, but also of what he can create, like the unity shown across America, during the horrific event. Like alot of people, I'll always remember.

       My So-Called Cyber-Life    What and interesting [interesting] night life I have online. However, let me say that I have nothing against online dating or relating. I'll admit, with no regret, that I've had my shares of momentary crushes and experienced heartbreak from people I have met online. There were even times I completely ignored the internet/online chatting altogether, hoping to forget the grief some "person" brought on me. Its crazy, but so true. However, inspite of this, I still love online chatting, simply because there are alot of interesting people out there to talk to. I mean, I'm a total insomniac sometimes, so I usually crawl out of bed and hit the chatrooms for a midnight chat. I find it all fascinating to tell you the truth. People are fascinating to me, even those who think they are boring. There are times I can't believe what comes out of these people's mouths, but hey, I'm all for freedom of speech, so more power to you. However, I may not agree with what they have to say and I tend to retaliate with my own opinion, but again, I can, so I will. I do think people on the internet tend to be more outspoken. But why is that? Why not be outspoken offline too??   Anyway, whatever the reason, I have met many interesting people online. Some from across the US, while others from around the world. Some I can say I even consider my best friends! (B & J!) The last few nights have also been incredible to me. There is this one person who caught my eye in one of the chatrooms many weeks ago, and yes, let me tell you, he has had my attention since! I've been thinking about him alot lately, and its crazy because we're "friends", good friends..."close" friends. I've shared alot of myself with him, mainly because I find myself attracted to him. Okay,  highly  attracted to him, possibly more than he knows too!! - I know, I know, but I kind of like the feeling...(*sigh* if only my life offline was this exciting!)

       On the eve of 9/11    Its just one day away, actually, a couple of hours from now...Who would have thought that this day last year the world seemed almost perfect. Its also fascinating to me that the one thing the terrorists thought to do, to cause fear and panic, instead brought people and families, our whole country, closer. The human spirit, man. Bombs and guns may be powerful, but they can never beat the human spirit, and in large numbers and standing united, we're unstoppable.

       Dear [Dirty] Diary,    Have you ever wanted to tell someone something so important, but were to afraid to confess it to them? Some times I feel like that is  MY WHOLE LIFE.  I consider myself pretty outspoken, yet when it comes to personal matters, mostly relating to me, I'm like a turtle hiding in it's shell....However, I'm changing all that. This is basically the place where I'll vent and just say what is on my mind, and trust me, I always have something to say. I normally write my thoughts down on paper, but I decided to be nice to the environment...yeah right. I do want to thank the millions of trees who died because people like me wanted several sheets of paper write on. *sigh* How awful is that?!...Anyway, this is my first official entry...and definately not the last. This is the beginning of my lil'dirty diary...After much consideration, I decided to write about the things currently happening in my life. All the good, all the bad, and well, absolutely  ALL  the naughty things that I would  NEVER  tell anyone, but want to share with someone, will be found here, written by me, AJ, for your viewing pleasure. =)

       Finding Mr. Right    For a while I was searching mad crazy for my so-called Mr. Right, and you know the type; the charasmatic, gorgeous man with a smile of champions and the person everyone wants. He makes your heart pound and he makes you weak in the knees. You think about him endlessly, and you dream of eternity with him. Mr. Right. Oh yes, everyone wants you.     I searched for my Mr. Right near and far, that was until someone told me to stop. He said that I wasn't going to find him if I pursued him with an obsession, which evidently, I was doing. I wanted Mr. Right with all the Mr. Right qualities, and dammit, I wanted him NOW! I realized quickly that I was obsessing over what I wanted in a significant other, rather than doing what most everyone out there does, adjust and accept what they get from a person, and hopefuly mold them into becoming what they want. Its the bitter truth, and I've seen it happen many times with mixed results. God knows my mother is still trying with my own father! Anyway, I decided not to search for Mr. Right anymore. I gave him up to the sucker who is still obsessing in finding him. (Two words for him: Wake Up!) Soon after I felt constant relief. I dated several guys with the thought of a possible relationship with one of them, however, that never came to be. Dating was nice, and not obsessing in finding Mr. Right, was even better.   So I met this much, much older man, an average joe (he is to me) from Nevada. He is well established, an educated man, and quite frankly, an honest and wonderful person in my eyes (again, he is to me!) We've had conversations that have gone on for hours at a time, and I like to think that we share many common interests. This guy totally blew me away and I absolutely love him for being who he is. He arrived in my life by total surprise, and I can honestly say now, Mr. Right exists! Shortly after I confessed my love for him and told him how perfect he was, he told me that he has never been a Mr. Right for anyone. I was shocked and baffled with the thought that he didn't see what I saw in him; a truely handsome and wonderful human being. I responded by assuring him that he was exactly what I wanted - he was MR. RIGHT, MY MR. RIGHT! I'm sure he may have his imperfections, but thats okay! Just don't show them to me (yet!) I want to bake in the afterglow of how he makes me feel - happy!

       Jinx!    Am I crazy?? I'm seriously asking for something bad to happen with my constant ranting of how "almost"  PERFECT  my relationship is with "Mr. Right!" (Yes, I said "almost"  PERFECT!  Its "almost"  PERFECT  because we've never had an argument before, so obviously its "almost"  PERFECT  - Ha! Try figuring that one out!) Anyway, now I'm wondering what our first big argument will be about. It'll probably be about something stupid, thats for sure. Either way, I'm so ready to balance this relationship and make it just  PERFECT.  *Laughing* Uuugh!! I can almost hear someone saying "I'll give you guys 6 months!" Oh my god!! That is just sooo wrong! :P

       The LOVE Vibe    Yes, sir, man, dude - I am! I am in  LOVE  with Mr. Right. He is absolutely the greatest man and human being I have ever met, and sooo much more too! I make him laugh all the time, and he makes me laugh too. So we both laugh constantly, and its SICK, I know, but  OH MY GOD,  the feeling is soooo nice. If you ask me, thats how it should be too. I mean, have you seen people supposedly in love, but they seem bored and just can't seem to synchronize with   The LOVE Vibe?  Its basically my term for the uncanny attraction that happens when people meet and instantly hit it off, or click with eachother. Its bizarre, but  The LOVE Vibe  can be very decieving too, so watch out. I have been fooled and so can you!  However, (and I say this knowing single people everywhere will hate me!) I did feel  The LOVE Vibe  with Mr. Right because we instantly clicked with eachother on so many levels when we met. So make a mental note my friends, trust the  The LOVE Vibe.  Feel  The LOVE Vibe.  It will make you feel all giddy and super-hyper-happy that you'll end up losng yourself (and a few pounds) in it. And don't forget, love is happiness. It's joy. It's bliss and it's a little piece of heaven that you share with the one you love.

       The Storm    Its amazing what a thunder storm and a few hours alone without power can do to a person. So it began with the local news reporting bad weather passing over the area where I live. We've been in a drought for a few months now, so any friendly shower is welcome. However, this shower was a thunderstorm and not very friendly if you ask me. Anyway, the lights flicker, and minutes later the whole neighborhood suffered a blackout. So there is no power, but at least the phones work. I mean, in case of an emergency, like the roof of your house caved in, or I've fallen into the river outside the front door and can't swim, dial 9-1-1. Nope, the phone lines were dead, so its basically fend-for-yourself-and-pray-this-so-called-needed-shower-doesn't-do-any-damage-to-my-property-because-I-have-no-house-insurance. *whew!*   The windows rattled with the thunder and I sank deeper into my bed and fluffy comforter. The tv is dead. My computer too. So basically during this time, I thought about my life and everything that has happened so far. However, if one thing I hate is having too much time on my hands, especially to think. Why? Well its really quite simple. I tend to over-examine everything, and in this case, my entire life, beginning with things that upset/bother/irritate me. This is bad because I remember every wretched, twisted, horrible, and disgusting thing that has ever happened, or has been said to me. Okay, this time it was something that a so-called friend told me months ago. For reasons  I DO NOT WANT TO SHARE,  this guy told my I was "clingy" - Yes, apparently I was too attatched and overbearing for him. I was in shock at the time, and really hurt by his statement, not to mention FURIOUS too, and permanently SCARRED because I'm still remembering his words and can't get passed it!    But anyway, I thought about my "clingy-ness" and wondered if I was doing it to Mr. Right. (You remember him? He's  My Mr. Right! ) Immediately I answered yes and put a check mark in the box. I realized I was being a little mushy too, which surprised me because I'm not the mushy type, but I'm doing it lately, especially around him. Okay, so have these two things down, but not figured out. I mean, how mushy and clingy can a person be without being overbearing? It was then that I remembered that saying  "Too much of a good thing is bad for you"  - however, I never quite got that. So after the storm, I decided Mr. Right should know what was on my mind. I asked him if I was being clingy and mushy, and I honestly expected a "Yes you are. Please cut it out, will you?" but instead I got "You're not clingy...and you're not overbearing at all." which was comforting to know, but it was the "I love you" part that followed that put my worries to rest. I realized my so-called friend had it all wrong. Its not called clingy-ness or being too mushy, its called affection, and people who love eachother tend to use it alot.

       Format Your Life    I've had a personal computer for about 3 years now, although I've been using the internet and living online for much longer than that. Anyway, like alot of things in the world, my pc has evolved, and I like to think I had a hand in its evolution. However, with that evolution its taken on an entire new state of existence, which at this very moment I passionately regret. A couple of months ago I updated (aka played God) with my pc and nervously introduced a new operating system. The installation was quick and painless, however, I soon learned I installed it in the wrong place, or rather, wrong drive. Panic. I did, but only for a few hours before I realized it wasn't so bad and I could work around it. What I didn't realize was that the soon-to-be pissed off monster I had created wouldn't like it one bit.    Flash forward a few months, and I'm running low of resources, space, everything apparently. My pc is very unhappy, and again, I feel responsible. So anyway, enter "formatting", the solution to all my problems, yet another painful procedure my pc must undergo. By formatting my hard drive I plan to restore and bring back the happy computer that once loved me. This formatting solution also made me wonder. Wouldn't it be something if we had a button that once pressed, could restore ourselves back to a more youthful stage in our life? Sure, we play god with machines, but what if there was someone who could do that to us?    *edited*  Umm, well, apparently there is. According to some people the certain "someone" I mentioned is "God." However, a few other people told me he is also known as a "Cosmetic Surgeon." - Go figure.

       The Age Thing    I think I've mentioned it before, but Mr. Right is much older than I am. The age gap between us isn't just a few years either, its actually a little more than that. (eerr..alot.) I really don't mind the age difference, but it does concern me sometimes, simply because some people won't (and will never) understand our realationship as it is and continues to evolve. Why? I honestly don't know, but I do think society has the wrong misconception on love sometimes. I also think that popular saying  'love has no boundries'  is a double standard S.O.B.! It does sound nice, but sometimes it is used wrongly. (i.e. 30 y/o with underage lolita, or teacher falling for an under age student. Love has no boundries, my ass! That is just wrong and people who use these powerful words for evil should just rot with their dirty gutter minds!) Anyway, I asked Mr. Right in the beginning of our online affair, if my age mattered to him. I asked because in the week prior to commiting to eachother, he mentioned to me that he would never date anyone younger. However, his reply was sincere and honest, and he told me he was willing to try if I was too, and of course I was. I was ready to take the next step with him and I had seen passed the age thing long before it came up, so I didn't mind the age difference because I loved him for who he was and not for how older (or younger) he may have been.   Anyway, some people claim that age is an important factor in a relationship. They say when you have someone who is around your age or a little older, say, 2-3 years older, you have a better understanding of eachother's likes and dislikes, not to mention, have the same common interests with eachother. In other words, you're like two peas in a pod, and you mash well like mash potatoes. However, I totally disagree because Mr. Right and I totally understand eachother. I believe we're on the same level, with the peas and mash potatoes too. I also believe that when you're really in love, looks and age shouldn't even matter.

       Oh Happy Day!    My pc had that operation (I reformated/reinstalled XP/personal data) over the weekend, and I must say that it was a total success! My pc survived and is expected to make a speedy recovery! *YAY* In a way, I think we've reconciled and made peace with eachother because it hasn't once crashed, given me errors, or simply stop responding! Ooooh, knock on wood! I think I may have totally jinxed myself...damn.

       HB2Me&2U!    My birthday was this past weekend and I must confess how extremely wonderful it was. (Minus the SCARY thoughts I had sometimes!) I don't think I've ever had such a wonderful birthday/gathering/dinner party before in all my 24 years of existing, but I did this past weekend. It was great and I was overwhelmed with the effort my family put into it too. Since they told me they were throwing something together, I was surprised and honestly felt like they didn't have to. But they did, and I loved every moment of my lil'BBQ part-ay. I love them so much and I have to say that I was surprised (stunned/shocked/ horrified!! ) that we actually sat down and talked like (gulp...dare I say it?!)  "adults."  Being the youngest in the bunch, it felt bizarre to me because, well, the gathering was a celebration and I was suppose to be happy (and I was!!), yet as I looked at everyone, quite quizzically at times, I was reminded with the bitter truth of it all; You are getting old, and that is just  SCARY  to me! Anyways, I am greatful and I love my family for making me feel so special on that day. I won't forget my lil'BBQ part-ay and the many laughs we had together. I'm hoping for a repeat next year too! ;)   Mr. Right surprised me as well with a beautiful gift! Oh my goodness gracious!! I was moved (and don't get confused now!) with the thought of the thought he put into finding such a beautiful watch for me. It is a gift I will put to good use and treasure forever, even when it becomes worn out. He also sent me a B-Day card and this is what he wrote:    As you see this gift, think of all the times we've had together and the moments yet to come. I love you!    He is the best, and if you're reading this, Mr. Right, I want you to know how special you are to me. You entered my life when I was about to give up on love. I felt hopeless and I thought I would be alone forever. I never, NEVER imagined someone so wonderful, so beautiful, and so caring existed until I met you. So on this day, YOUR special day, I want to thank you for being my best friend and now my soul mate too. I love you! and   Happy Birthday!

       Happy Halloweenie!    On the eve of Halloween, the scariest time of the year, I've come to face the hauntings of yesteryear, and of those before that. Yeah, it sounds a little ridiculous, but since I entered my 20's, I began asking myself, quite frequently too,  "what scares you?  - Its a tough question to answer, but I asked because alot of the little things that scared me as a child, I out grew. I mean, horror movies and axe murders, still scare me, although some are just laughable now, but getting older and trying to begin an adult life is just a tad bit more frightening than anything else I've ever had to face. That is scary, and so is the thought sometimes.   When I turned 21, my life was complicated, and alot of the time I felt stuck just being me. I was afraid of alot of things too, mainly life and being alone. Everyone that I knew was moving on with their lives, sometimes it seemed like at 100 mph, with no signs of slowing down. Then there was me, standing alone and watching as my friends evolved. I was jealous at times, of them, of their lives, but the fear of taking those steps to catch up remained with me. I don't know why I was so afraid, but I was.   Turning 24 was an eye opener. Alot of the things I questioned and feared became unimportant. I learned alot about myself in the last four years, and I'm still learning. Its amazing to me how much I have changed. I mean, on this day, last year, on this supposed scariest day, I was afraid of my life as a whole. But now, for the first time in my life I can honestly say that I don't find myself afraid of life, but completely engrossed in it. I love who I am, and the only scariest thing I can think of that could ruin that is not liking what I have become.

       November    Wow. Its been a while since I last wrote in my blog. What can I say? I've been busy. Mr. Right is still making me very happy and I love him more everyday. I doubt things will ever change. (Well damn, I think I just jinxed two perfect months with Mr. Right!) Hmmm. Doubtful. I will say this; I now know he is my dream guy, literally! *wink* (I love you, D!)    Ooooh! My very best friend Jen just had her baby! Yes, after nine months of having a bun in the oven, she delivered a beautiful, handsome baby boy on Novermeber 11, 2002! Welcome to the world  Gideon Emmanuel ! (what a name!! I love it!!) Both mommy and baby (daddy too) are doing fine, and I really want to congradulate them on such a wonderful accomplishment. I mean, they're PARENTS now! Wow! It truely is amazing.   Life is peachy. Life is wonderful. Life is soooo good. Live it, Love it, and cherish every moment.

       Happy Thanxgivin'    Oooh, I can hardly wait for tomorrow! I love Thanksgiving, but I hate the "Oh god, I ate far to much" feeling after, and the "You're going on a diet or DIE" thoughts as well. I mean, on Thanksgiving you just have to eat a little bit of everything or face being outcasted by your mean aunt for not trying her secret recipe dish. The day after I'm regreting the extra gravey on the mashed potatoes I added, as well as all the "second" serving(s) I had. *eeeek!* I shudder with the thought. It is really sad how I can eat and feel guilty at the same time. Now if I could only sleep and do laundry at the same time too, all would be well. Happy Thanksgiving!   [edited] Umm, yeah, apparently you can sleep and do laundry - its called sleepwalking! DUH!

       Have yourself, a Merry lil' Ghettoland X-Mas!    The holidays are comin', the holidays are comin'! Actually, they are here and so are the massive crowds and endless lines at the shopping mall. You know, my family has a rule when it comes to Christmas shopping: Do your shopping before December rolls around, or face the wrath of hundreds of psychotic shoppers! I love Christmas time. I love going all out on the holiday decor too. ("Oh boy, do I!" he says, enthusiastically) It is really sad, but I like having plastic Santa's through out my lawn, and lights on just about any thing. It is like Disneyland a la tacky ghetto style, or maybe I should just call it Ghettoland? Oh yes, lets have a Ghettoland Christmas! Com'on now! (uumm...errr) My whole neighborhood goes all out too. So far the lady down the street is giving my Ghettoland a run for its money. I will give her props for embracing the Christmas spirit. I mean, she really got possessed by it! (-HA! An original joke by me, thank you, thank you!) Anyway, I love Christmas time. It doesn't snow here, but it does get cold, so I like that too. It really is the most wonderful time of the year. (Including the psychotic shoppers-who-will-do-anything-for-a-parking-place-and the long lines...Merry Christmas!)

       Twas the night before Christmas...    Actually, its not, but whatever. I can't believe its almost here. Christmas that is. The whole month of December went by so fast and I'm kind of sad to see it go. Its been a blast though. I've enjoyed it very much with the exception of tthe heavy traffic, mad shoppers, and the endless waiting for a parking lot at the mall. Other than that, its been nice. I finished my shopping, then again, I didn't have to buy much. I got my mom a charm for her charm bracelet. She got it last year, but has yet to make it all charmy. Its dull, but lets see how my lil' heart will make it sparkle. *hehehe* I bought my sister, the middle child, a staionary set. I put it in a basket with a few other staionary nick-nacks like those small scented candles, colored pens, sticky post-its, etc..I know she will use all these things in her busy mom life. I got my older sister a pair of silver earrings and a bracelet. She loves stuff like that, so I know she'll be happy. Here's hoping I get something nice! -- I'll keep you posted!    My Right. Wow. Its been like 3 months now since we found eachother, and let me just say that its been the most wonderful 3 months of my entire life. He really is the man of my dreams and I will love him forever. What I like about us is that we are, without a doubt, in sync with eachother. We share a connection of somekind, one that I don't think we built, because I KNOW its always been there. Since we met I was drawn to him; his personality and mine just clicked, and we laughed and talked like we knew eachother forever. Its funny, but we know eachother so well that we think alike, and OHMYGOD, a good example: when I bought him his Christmas gift, he was thinking of getting me the same thing...AND HE DID! We both ended up giving eachother silver bracelets without knowing! It completely blew us away. He opened his gift first, and I watched, unaware that he was laughing at the coincidence to our gifts. When I opened the gift he gave me, I was in utter shock, but then started laughing too. It was an uncanny moment, and now a beautiful memory for me. I love you, D!   MERRY CHRISTMAS!

       January    I've been ignoring this place for quite some time, and I've done it purposely, mind you. Why? Well, several reasons really. I've been busy trying to figure out where my life is going, and since I don't know, it is hard to write with a million thoughts going through your head. I honestly don't know what I should be doing, or where I should be going in my life. I feel somewhat lost and like I haven't found my place on this world, and it really bothers me sometimes. I'm 24 years old and you'd think maybe I would have gotten a clue by now, but I haven't. I get depressed about it too. I think alot about where I'll be in five years and whether or not I'll be happy, successful, or with someone. I'm actually thinking about that as I write this now. Its bad, but in all honesty, deep down I know I will only do my best.   When the new year arrived I promised myself I would live this year to the fullest. A new year, a new me. That is what I told myself. I made several resoultions too. Feel good. Look great. Be healthy. I know it is easier said than done, but I hope for the best, and again, I know I will only do my best. Come what may, I do strongly feel that this new year will be a landmark in my little life, and I am looking forward to seeing that transpire. Like always, I'll keep in touch.

       Valentine's Day    I had the most wonderful Valentine's Day -- EVER! In the past, I've never had a reason to celebrate Valentine's Day, mainly because I didn't have a Valentine to share it with. I used to be a little bitter about it too, and I totally admit it. Yes. That is correct. But so would anyone! After years of being alone, I can say that I grew to become anti-Valentine. The day would come and go, and I'd stay at home, in bed, looking like shit, and watch Pretty in Pink a few hundred times. I mean, it's a day of love and I was missing out because I was alone. I think everyone would agree (single people, I don't care what you say, you know I speak the truth!) that being alone of Valentine's Day is like the saddest day of the year. It is depressing and unfair. I too want to be in love. I too want to hold hands, walk on the beach, have a nice dinner, kiss, hug, snuggle up, have strawberries and whipped creme and eat it off of bodies. I too want to hear the words 'I love you', 'Happy Valentine's Day baby!', and even, 'Will you marry me?' (in some cases, it happens, or so I'm told). Its hard to believe, but in all my 24 years of existing, I've never had a Valentine's Day worth remembering... until now.   This Valentine's Day was everything I heard it could be. Okay, so there wasn't any walks on the beach, nice dinners, or even strawberries, naked bodies and whipped creme. But there was love. Lots of love. And really, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?

       February    WOW. It has been almost a month since my last entry. Several things have gone down since I last wrote in here. First up, I am still very commited to Mr. Right. My love for him continues to grow everyday since we confessed our feelings for eachother (some five months ago, mind you! And for your information, this relationship has been the best and longest one I have ever had!). He always manages to impress me, and I love that about him. In the last few months he has showered me with wonderful words of love and given me thoughtful gifts. It is really amazing, and I have learned so much about him along with myself in the process.   Now, I'm not saying our relationship has been perfect because it hasn't. This brings me to the second thing I want to talk about. Mr. Right and I have argued a few times and have had a few misunderstandings in our time together. And, I want to say and admit here, now, that I can be the jealous boyfriend type at that snap of the fingers. I can. Really. I have never been the jealous type in the past, mainly because I never cared much for the people I dated. But not, it is like, different. Now I am in love, and I'll be damned if someone tries to come between me and my happiness. Damned, I say, damned! Anyway, Mr. Right has managed to piss me off a few times. By a few, I mean, no more than 4 times, which is good in my book. The reasons for this have been trust related. Yeah, I have trust issues. I do because I have been burned in the past. I tend not to trust people until I feel they are worthy of being trusted. I don't have many friends, mainly because I feel like I can't trust them, so when your boyfriend lies and goes behind your back and does something you specifically told him not to, it is like, a shot to the heart, and I take personal offense to it. That is exactly what happened this past Sunday.    I won't go into a lot of detail, but I was so severely wounded by his actions that I just wanted to end our relationship altogether. Yeah, I could have too. In our time together, I have become a little impulsive, like acting without thinking it through, and at times, I find myself completely overwhelmed that I would just find the easy way out rather than think things through. HOWEVER, this past Sunday, I wiped away my tears, inhaled and just reviewed all the crap that went down. And then, after a few hours of thinking, I decided to talk to Mr. Right. So we talked for hours and we reached a pivotal point in our relationship. I was honest and simply told him all that had to be said.   We are still very much in love today. I love him. 'Nuff said.

       Inner Thoughts    I'm starting a new section in my Blog called   Inner Thoughts  . It's basically me talking about random shit that I got going on in my head. They're thoughts that plague me until I forget or simply snap out of. I can be an obsessive fool when it comes to analyzing my thoughts and dreams. I mean, they obviously have meaning, or at least they do at times. Why else would I be thinking so heavily about these things if they didn't matter? Anyway, these are thoughts that linger in my head and that I must confess to my Dirty Diary.    --Christina Aguilera: Every time I look in the mirror, I'm reminded that "I am beautiful no matter what they say/words can't bring me down". It is really sad that I must sing this song at least once a day in order to function. Damn the radio.   --Special K with freeze dried strawberries: Okay, who likes potpourri in their cereal? Exactly.    --Carnal thoughts: Yeah, and I don't mean your run-of-the-mill clear the desk sex either. I mean, hardcore, up the wall, angry bitch sex. I want it bad. I want it good. And above all else, I want it many, many times. I'm officially a pervert now, I know. Too bad these are just thoughts and not actions.   --The Gap: I want to live there. Hell, I want to work there too. At the risk of sounding like a commercial whore, I honestly love the clothing and would dance like a stupid fool in their commercials too. Damn. Now I want a gift certificate. Maybe if I think real hard my boyfriend will send me one. *wink*    --Reality TV: There are so many things wrong with TV nowadays. Hell, even mentioning TV is bad. Reality TV is like eating candy and rotting out your teeth. For real! It's bad for you, but you just have to have it. Regardless, I love reality TV, and I must say that without it, TV is just unreal and fake...   --Smiling: I've been smiling a lot, and I've noticed myself doing it for no reason too. I think it means that I am happy. So, I might as well confess, I am!   END.

       Ducktape??    Like what the fuck? Why is it that every time I turn on the TV there is some refrence to ducktape and how it will save people incase of a biological/nuclear attack? Again, like what the fuck, man? What the hell is wrong with people? Ducktape will not save you! Like, hello! Incase of a biological attack, you'd probably breathe the shit faster than you can cut the damn grey tape to seal the windows and doors. But again, as if that will even help.  It is ridiculous, really. Don't even get me started on a nuclear attack! Remember those old black & white safety films from yesteryear? You know, the ones that had those school kids hidding under their desks after hearing the emergency sirens? Those films were created to instruct people on what to do incase of a nuclear attack. But seriously now, do you think that hidding underneath a desk and ducktaping the windows and doors of your home (not to mention every single nick and cranny that allows air to flow into your home) is going to save you? I doubt it, man. Plus, if a nuclear bomb goes off, you'll probably be wearing that desk and ducktape on your face. True shit, yo. True shit! Go rent the movie "The Sum of All Fears" and you'll know what I'm talking about.

       March Madness    Make that insanity. For real, man. Okay, first up, I want to start by saying that on March 14, 2003, Mr. Right and I will have reached six months in our relationship. That is half a year just so you know. Yeah, I know. Wow! Secondly, it is getting harder. Long distance relationships, like we have, can be a little lonely sometimes, and I am feeling that now more so than ever. At the risk of sounding like an obsessed, love struck fool, I yearn for Mr. Right. Those  carnal thoughts  I mentioned before (read Inner Thoughts) have become overly intense. So much so that I wake up in the middle of the night, aroused and wanting him  so  badly. I officially know what it is to want/crave/hunger/need someone so badly. I've tried explaining to him how it feels, but I've failed miserably and don't think he quite understands where I am coming from. It sounds silly, but really, it's not. I feel fustrated and just want to hop on a plane and go to him now to end my longing for him. Having him close to me, to my heart and body, is all I really want. It hurts me  knowing well  that it is not that easy too. It's hard and it sucks big time. I know he gets upset when I ask for pictures of himself. I know I ask continuosly for them too, and ask, and ask, and ask. I wish he understood that its not that I   want   them; I   need   them. They keep me close to him when he is not around. And looking at him, and I mean, really looking closely at him, I don't need to close my eyes to imagine him close to me --  like right now.

       Evanescence - "My Immortal"    i'm so tired of being here  suppressed by all of my childish fears  and if you have to leave  i wish that you would just leave  because your presence still lingers here  and it won't leave me alone     these wounds won't seem to heal  this pain is just too real  there's just too much that time cannot erase    when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears  when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears  and i've held your hand through all of these years  but you still have all of me    you used to captivate me  by your resonating light  but now i'm bound by the life you left behind  your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams  your voice it chased away all the sanity in me    these wounds won't seem to heal  this pain is just too real  there's just too much that time cannot erase    when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears  when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears  and i've held your hand through all of these years  but you still have all of me    i've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone  and though you're still with me  i've been alone all along    It's funny how a song can explain everything I feel. When I played it for the first time, I was literally moved to tears. It touched me in a way that it made me understand what happened to you and I. I cried endlessly afterward. I know things will be different now. I know.

       Too Close to Home    Words cannot explain the sorrow I feel for the families of the POW's caught in Iraq. I was shocked by the images I saw on TV, but far more disturbed when I found out that one of the POW's was from my hometown. I got chills when I saw the images of his badly beaten face on TV, and later his family's reaction on the local news. I can't believe this is happening! It's crazy!   Since the news broke out, people have been coming together to show their support. It's really touching and extremely welcomed during a time like this. The entire city is talking about this and their keeping hope alive for his release. I truely hope that all the POW's are treated well. The images I've seen of their treatment are less than satisfactory, but they are saying that now more than ever must Iraq treat them humanely, and more importantly, keep them alive. It's unbelieveable what is happening over there. The world continues watching, as do I.

       The War    I'm glued to the TV for what seems like hours, just watching the news coverage on the war with Iraq. I know I shouldn't be watching so religiously, but its like, happening (on all the TV channels mind you), and not only that, this war is going on in my lifetime! It's surreal, really. All this is happening a world a way, and here I am, watching it on TV and writing about it now. Some of the images they've shown are breathtaking, but others are like utterly frightening. I find myself sometimes changing the channels, almost as if it were a movie and not happening. But that is usually when reality sets in. It's happening. We are at war, and I hope and pray that what comes out of it is good for the future of America and Iraq.

       Spring    I love Spring, but daylight savings sucks! I'm like a total mess right now because of it. I haven't been sleeping well at all and I blame (well, partially blame) the Spring foward-time-crap for it. I can't sleep and when I do fall asleep, I have to get up. It's ridiculous! I feel like I'm reverting into that insomniac/slash/night owl that I was a few months ago. I hate it! I was doing so well, what happened?    Well, several things come to mind. Actually, I think I've pinned pointed the exact cause of my insomnia:   Mr. Right  .  Let's see. Oh yeah, Mr. Right and I broke-up. I won't go into a lot of detail, (mainly because the topic still troubles me) but at the time, the break-up wasn't mutual. I didn't want to break-up with him. I strongly believed in what we had and the connection we shared for one another. What we had was special and he made me feel wonderful. He awoke feelings in me that I never thought I had. How could I not hang on to all that?   It's hard not to think of him. I sometimes get a knot in my stomach when I think of him and what was us.   Anyway, in the end we did break-up, and since then I've been in recovery mode. The last few weeks have been extremely tough on me. Lately, I've been struggling to find some sort of reason to hate him, but I can't because there is nothing there. I figured if I found something that could make me hate him, it would make my recovery easier. Wrong. Its typical ex-boyfriend behavior, or so I'm told.    I feel abit trapped at the moment. I know I should try to move on, but I feel stuck, and for that reason it triggers my claustrophobia, which is a total pain. I can't sit for more than twenty minutes without feeling mildly ill. I hate it. I have to get up and walk around to calm myself. Drama queen anyone? Hardly. I've always been this way. It is one of the many issues I have with myself. I am getting better though because I don't think I'll always be this way.    I love Spring. I'm going to go take a walk right now. It's a beautiful day and I want to take advantage of it.

       Easter: The Movie    Well, what can I say? Easter is upon us. My family usually throws a big party to celebrate Easter. They're always fun too, and completely unpredictable. By unpredictable I mean anything can happen on this special day. With kids running around and people everywhere, I'm sure I'll catch some really embaressing moments on film and on the cam-corder. Am I crazy-insane for hoping someone falls, or someone gets hit in the nuts by some out of control child?? Or, I know, a family fight breaks out and fists are flying all over the place! Oh, I want that! I want that so very much!! Kodak moments, y'all! Those are always fun to remember, but more fun to watch on video! I'm serious too! I can't wait to see what develops...   I've been listening (non-stop) to Lisa Marie Presley's CD "To Whom It May Concern" -- I absolutely love it! The girl knows pain and she can sing it so well too. I think she's really beautiful and I love her current look. I also think she looks better now than she did a few years ago. She must have found a stylist or something. Anyway, she rocks and I dig her.  I've been listening to all kinds of music lately and not just LMP. I have Tina Turner, Cher, and some new Madonna playing continueously on my cd player. It's comfort music for my soul, or so I'd like to believe. I also find myself getting inspired to write. Not music though, more like the screenplay I've been meaning to start writing. I've never done anything of the sort, but I've done plenty of research on writing a script and I know I am more than capable of doing one. Anyway, music wasn't my only inspiration....   A few days ago, I met a charming lad from South Carolina in an online chatroom. He seemed nice, so we talked for a few hours that night. (Actually, he was extremely nice, so we talked all night and to the break of dawn! --  He was interesting, what can I say?!) Anyway, he's creative and he got me thinking of writing a movie script with a Gay theme. I had already thought of doing that; however, I hadn't exactly thought it through thoroughly. He gave me some interesting ideas that I just had to write down, and from what I have now, I think I can create something worth telling. I really want to write it and I know I can do it if I put my all into it. I recently told a good friend of mine that I wanted to write a screenplay and he replied by telling me that I was destined to write something that people were going to notice. I was momentarily stunned by his comment. He has read some of my crazy stories and thought they are really good. Since then, I haven't been able to get his words out of my head, but I know who I'm thanking when I win an OSCAR for my screenplay. (Is it wrong of me to look that far ahead in the future? I could just be setting myself up for a lot of disappointment...Hmmm...)

       I know you can hear me    Hey you,   It's 3 am I find myself thinking about you. As I write this and speak of you, chills run through my body as I remember our time together. I was reminded today of how special you were to me by the little things I saw. Soon after, I found myself fantasing and having short and pointless conversations with you on my way from running some erands. (I know, I know -- Its crazy and I know its not healthy, but I can't help it.) I know I should really try to move on, but how can I when a part of me still hangs on to the memory of you and us. I feel like such a fool sometimes to tell you the truth. I should have done more, talked more, maybe even found some common ground and worked things out with you.   Its so hard now, but is it too late?   I feel really sad knowing that I not only lost you as a lover and companion, but as a great friend as well. Through out the beginning of our relationship, I told you that I could never hate you even if we didn't work out. It's something I remember a lot now that we don't talk anymore. I don't know if those words mean anything to you now, but if you're reading this, I'm keeping my word and promise. I don't hate you and I don't want it to stay like this. I know you're angry, and I feel your pain -- its overwhelming at times and on some days, but it doesn't have to be this way between us. If you want to talk, I'm here; I'll always be here for you. My number is still the same. Contrary to how I said I was going to change it, I didn't. I'm glad I didn't. Intuition and hope, like always, kept me from doing it. What can I say? If I'm not home, leave me a message. If you see me online, buzz me and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Don't be a stranger, you, because you're not to me.  Take Care.

       "You don't know what you got 'till its gone."    Like the song goes, 'you don't know what you got 'till its gone'. You really don't have any idea of how important things are to you until they are gone from your life. Because of the break-up, Mr. Right and I didn't talk at all to eachother. We played the silent game and brought much more distance between us; far more than the thousands of miles that had already existed. I guess it's a natural human response to do this after a break-up, but as we found out Sunday night, April 27, 2003, we should have talked sooner.    I felt months of excess weight suddenly lift my shoulders as we talked, and I'll admit, it surprised me to a point that I couldn't quite speak. I don't think I've ever felt that before in my life! To further explain what I felt, it was an overwhelming, nice and warm, cathartic experience. (Yeah, I broke it down after thinking heavily about it. Plus, I've always wanted to use the word 'cathartic' but have never been able to use it for the reason that it's never happened to me before! For that, I do say, thank you to Mr. Right, who has yet again managed to bring a new experience into my life.) Anyway, after months of carring so much weight and mixed, unsure emotions, it was a moment of emotional release. It was relief like the kind you get after a great night's sleep. (Which I had later that night as well -- it was wonderful!) We talked, we caught up, and we're friends again. We should have done this a long, long time ago. God knows it would have spared us both a lot of pain. But still, no regrets. I'm glad how things worked out in the end, which isn't the end exactly, but more like a new beginning. I'm happy and I hope he is too. (Raise Glass) Here's to good, make that, great friends!

       My Mama    With Mother's Day approaching, I want to talk about my mama. Okay, let me start by saying that my mama is the best in the world! My mama is the #1 woman in my life and that is final! At the risk of sounding like a straight up mama's boy (which I'm not because my mama has other concerns beside me), my relationship with her has become an important part of my life.  As a crazy, confused adolescent teen, growing up wasn't easy, especially when you're trying to keep things like your life, problems, and emotions a secret and hidden from the world. But instead of being overbearing like some parents are and always being in your face to a point of combustion, my mama gave me room to breathe, and let me tell you, it is possibly the best gift she has giving me since giving me life and shooting me out of her vagina. The space she gave me allowed me to find myself and grow to become the intelligent, somwhat lazy, friendly, creative and outspoken person that I am today. And for that, mama, I say thank you. You mean the world to me and I love you.

       Inner Thoughts    Okay, lately, I've been thinking about some stuff, so I decided another installment of  Inner Thoughts   was in order. It's basically me just ranting on some random stuff that I'm thinking about 24/7. Anyway, here goes...   -Summer. It's so hot here and I know come Summer time it will get hotter! With that, the song by Nelly is constantly playing in the back of mind with the thought of the heat, and or the meer mention of it.  "Its gettin' hot in heere, so take off all your clothes..."  is what the song says, and let me tell you, it's not a bad idea. I have been working out lately, but to expose flesh, to me, is have to expose my hairy-ness, which brings me to my next thought.   -Hair. Yes, I am part a dying breed. I am one of the last few hairy men left in the world, but don't get me wrong. I love my hairy-ness. Men who have three chest hairs think it is a great accomplishment to have them, so just think what men with a full chest-of-hair think. I love my hairy chest and I embrace the fact that I have it, and I mean that literally. I love to run my fingers through my hairy chest-carpet, hell, I love when someone else does it too! However, we hairy men live in a society where hair (hairy chest, in my case) is thought of being gross and simply unnecessary. So, that said, I'm thinking about shaving. (I'm so sorry hairy men of the world united! Please don't hate meee!) I don't know if I can though.   -Madonna. She like released her new CD a few weeks ago, but has like dropped from the face of the earth. Is this the end of the material mom? Madonna, where ever you are, I still adore you! Brown hair or not, you rock!   -Tea. Okay, so I've taken up tea drinking. By that I mean that I now drink herbal teas during the day, and it scares me because people tell me it's a sign of getting old. Do I want to get old? HELL NO! But I'll drink tea anyway. (I like green tea with a mix of berry extracts. It's the best! Yumm.)   -Exercise. Yeah, I have been doing that a lot nowadays and I wonder if it is because I'm trying to keep busy. Since the break-up, I've had a lot of time on my hands, so exercise has been keeping me extremely busy. However, I'm being cautious in not letting it get out of control. I tend to obsess over things and getting super buff is not something I want to do. I do want rock-hard abs. I wonder how they feel...   -The carnel sex craving/dreams have stopped, but now I'm in a kiss-lip-frenzy! I want a good set of lips to lock on to, and I want them soft and wet too! I find myself staring at guy's lips sometimes and wondering (dreaming) what they feel and taste like. It's crazy, I know, but dammit, so much fun.   -Being single. Two words: It sucks! I know, harsh, but it's true. Oh well...I guess it's just me and my penis for now.

       Teeth Friendly    I had an interesting weekend! However, there are some things you should know first. Okay, let me start by saying that after years of going to my family's dentist, the same dentist I've been seeing since like I was a pre-teen, I decided to get a new one. (A new dentist that is.) My last few vists with my old dentist were less than satisfactory and I simply couldn't take it anymore. So, my aunt, who had work done on her teeth a few months ago, recommended her dentist, Dr. Allure. Yes, Dr. A-L-L-U-R-E. At first, I was like, he sounds like 007's dentist or something, and I laughed and entertained myself with his name. It was funny! Really! Dr. Allure. Say it! Okay, I'm crazy...   Anyway, so I call and make an appointment and the receptionist is like "Well, Dr. Allure requires that all new patients be evaluated." In other words, to get my teeth looked at, Dr. Allure has to approve. I was like, WHAT THE FUCK?! I couldn't help but think if that was even legal. I mean, can he do that? And if so, why? Is he afraid of crocked teeth? Tartar? Hell, buck teeth? Not that I have any of those problems, but he's a dentist! He shouldn't fear teeth! Geez! So I agree and my evaluation is on Saturday at 11am, but I was convinced that I was going to ask him about his little rule when I met him.   Saturday comes around and I'm nervous. I get nervous when going to see any doctor, it being a dentist or not. I just don't like them! Doctors scare me, really. I just try to avoid them as much as possible. Anyway, I'm at the dentist office and after doing all the paper work for the receptionist, I get called in. I'm sooo nervous, hungry, and just plain worried he is going to say 'NO' to me about my teeths or something of the sort. The dentist's assistant is a young girl and a typical dentist assistant in every single way. Let's call her Elle. She's little, not blonde, but very clueless. She is bubbly and the happy-go-lucky type with a huge, extra white smile, and a killer body. (I just know she had one because she had everything else!) Elle gets me prepared as I sit on the chair and wait for the doctor to arrive. She asks me what kind of music I like, and I respond by saying "Huh?" as in, why-are-you-asking-me-that-question? And then I think maybe she is just making conversation, which could be the case. However, I have a thing about making conversation with women, mainly don't. One thing usually leads to another, and by the time I realize what is *really* going on, she asks for my number and I have to tell her that I love men and have no use for her vagina. That didn't happen.  Elle explained that they have a large selection of CD's and that I can choose what kind of music I want to hear during the dental session. I was literally in awe. I mean, wow, no crappy dentist-office-I-heard-this-on-an-elevator-once, music?? She took out a list of the collection of music they had, and again I was in awe. And, I couldn't make up my mind! There were so many good choices! From freaking Aerosmith to Madonna! (Neither of which I would want to hear! Too intense and too pop-slut-ish!) I chose Train's Drops of Jupitor. I just love that CD. So, anyway, I tell Elle that Train will do and that they have quite a selection. She replies by telling me that the doctor is a 'big music buff' and that he likes all types of music. Very cool! I must meet this Dr. Allure immediately! Shortly after, my natural nervous nature faded as I waited anxiously for the doctor to arrive.   A few minutes later, I met Dr. Allure, the dentist with the funny name and strange rules. However, I am not laughing as he enters the room. I'm more mesmorized by his entire existence. Dr. Allure, 007's dentist, is like a total, absolute, fine piece of real estate-I'm-gonna-get-me-some-man/hottie/holy mother of Cher/gorgeous man! Tall, dark, young, handsome and with the hands of a surgeon. And I know this because he touched me! Well, my face, or rather, jaw. (I had a little stubble too, but he didn't seem to mind!) He massaged my jaw and told me that my jaw line was in excellent condition. If it had been any other doctor I would have totally said "WHATEVER, get on with it," but it was Dr. Allure, and I wanted more nice compliments and facial massages. Anyway, by this time I'm hooked as a fish on a fishing rod. No need to reel me in. I'm already there! He goes on by telling me that my teeth are in great condition and that I have no cavities! (YAY!) However, he deep cleans my teeths with his little dentist gadgets and sings along with Train. Yes, he sings. He tells me he loves Train and that their new album is great. He has it, but has yet to add it to "the collection." I'm not responding, but slightly moving my eyebrows and trying to hold still. I'm also trying not to be obvious with the suprise in my pants. Yes, I had wood, aka an erection. And, thank God for relaxed/loose jeans! I would have hated to be wearing my tight 501's and be all noticable! Then again, he was so close to my leg, I could have sworn I felt HIS erection too. Oh doctor!   Anyway, after the session came to an end, he asked me if I had any questions. "Of course," I said, "I have several." I asked him if I needed braces, (only after my ex-dentist said I should consider getting them; to him, I now say, fuck you!) but Dr. Allure said, "No, but you definately need to get your wisdom tooth pulled out, or you will probably need braces, because the wisdom tooth will push your teeth forward." I cringed. It was devistating news, but I completely undstand. (I'm having that done...soon.) I asked him if flossing after each meal was good, and he said, "Yes, but only if you're careful and don't obsess about doing it." WHAT? I laughed slightly and took a little offense to it. I mean, okay, so I obsess over things--whatever! Teeth should look pretty. You only have one set of them, so you should keep them looking good. Dr. Allure goes on by telling me that a lot of people obsess over their teeths and think they are doing good to them when they aren't. Hmm. That is understandable, I suppose.    Anyway, I ask Dr. Allure if I've been 'approved' to see him again, and he laughs and slightly shakes his head. He touches my arm (first he touches, then strokes it, and then gently taps it. It was a 10 second heavenly getaway!) and then leans into me to tell me that "the evaluation" is to get "a better understanding" of what he "will be dealing with." He tells me that he's "a dentist and not a God," and that he "can only do so much to help people," which is so true. (Now, why didn't I think of that?) He then extended out his hand and helped me out of the chair. The dude get's a thousand points for that friendly gesture. It was so nice of him! I usually have to crawl out of the dentist chair. Then he extends out his hand again to shake mine, smiles, and tells me to have a great day and that he looks forward to our next vist. I'm like mesmorized by his charm and walking on clouds in that moment. If I had been a whore, I would have done numerous things to his body, mouth, and, well, you get the picture, in that single moment! However, I'm not a whore, therefore, I will simply fantasize about him and I in several possitions, instead. I swear to God there was sexual energy in that room! I know he was hard. I just know!   I have a new dentist now. Dr. Allure, with the alluring eyes, great personality, awesome smile, and the world's greatest hands. He's a great singer, smart music buff, and friendly flirt, who's also teeth friendly if you ask me. Now, I must retire. It's late and I need to go floss.

       The Ignore Game    How long will you go on playing this little childish game of ignore? Have you grown tired yet? You will. Ask yourself, am I blind? How long will it take for you to see how stupid this is? What brought this on? How did it come to this? Why are you doing this?    Am I mad? Not really. I am disappointed on the way you're handling this. Drama, anyone? Yes, but no thank you. I honestly thought we were making progress. Was I wrong to assume that? Probably. Once, I asked what I did to deserve such an incredible man. Now I ask what I've done to be part of his ignore game. Tell me. What did I do? You have a voice, so speak.   In a way, I kind of understand why you're doing this, but I'm sure you have your own reasons. I can't say that it doesn't hurt. It does. All the time. Karma, anyone? Yes, thank you. I know one day you'll see and look back at all this. I know you will.   The ignore game. Keep playing. It's your game, not mine.   From someone who confessed their soul to you once, you're a fool, but I'm probably a bigger one to admit it.

       Papa's Day    Today is Father's Day, so without further ado, I want to take this time to thank m'daddy for ejaculating into my mother's vagina and giving me life. Daddy, without your white-ish semen and man juice, I wouldn't be here today. Thank you. Thank you for your participation and having a hand in my creation. From the bottom of my little, sarcastic, but greatful heart, Happy Father's Day!   Now, I must go. My mom is throwing a big dinner party for my pops and I don't want to be late. And, If I wish to take credit for the potato salad I did not do, I should get there before all my other family arrives. *hehehe* Happy Father's Day!

       The Ignore Game - part 2    I know you read my previous entry. I know you did, so don't deny it. Did I hit a nerve? Strike a cord? Upset you? Anger you? Did it hurt? You can't stay away, can you? Then why? Why continue your little game of ignore?   You can easily end it with a hello, or some sort of sign. But, it starts with you ending the game and not me. It hurts when you leave at the sign of my presence. It hurts even more when you know it's because of you. I hang in there and simply try to make sense of it all, but why do this when you don't have to?   I try hard to look pass it; to look beyond the mess that is now. But, it is difficult when the game continues. I know I hurt you. I'm really sorry I did. You should know that I've never been one for games. However, sometimes I know you participate anyway. You're caught in them whether you like it or not. The games people play. Sick entertainment to some, heartache for others. Intentionally, or out of spite, it hurts either way. The ignore game. When will it end?   After all this, I know you have something to say. Speak and tell me;  TELL ME  and not those who will stray. You know I'm here. You know I want it to end. You know the game can't go on forever. It's pointless. Let it end.   As you already know writing is my release, although, at times, it hurts just as much as the thought.

       End Game   So, I'm glad we talked. Actually, I'm delighted we did. The conversation we had this evening was the missing link to the problem that was between us. I know you said it was your problem and that you were responisible for creating it, but I can't help but feel responsible for causing you some grief too. And instead of apologizing to you, like I keep doing, I'm going to promise that I will help you in any way that I can. Like any true friend would, you can count on me. I have your back. Need a partner for a bank heist? I'm your guy. Partners in crime! Friends to the end! Seriously though, I want you to know that I'm here for you. You can talk to me whenever you want. I'll be there for you; always.  Regardless of what you think you've done to hurt me in the past, you continue meaning a lot to me. Believe it or not, you continue being an important part in my little life. Yes, its true. You are important to me. What's that? Why, you ask? Well, you tell me.   You know, its not easy to do what we did, but we did it. It usually takes people years to make peace with a former ex-whatever. But we did it, because deep down inside of me, and maybe you too, we know we continue being connected, even after all these months that have passed. Through thick or thin, true friends, as they say, are forever.

       Finding Our Way Back   I've been ignoring my diary for a week now, mainly because I have nothing to say other than I'M THE MOST HAPPIEST PERSON IN THE WORLD, and I know nobody wants to hear that said over and over and, well, you get the idea. It just sounds crazy if you aren't me or my man, Mr. Right aka Mr. Forever. Yes,  Mr. Forever ! He is now Mr. Forever and for always too. Plus, you really can't elaborate any more than that. It is pretty clear. Crystal, even. I'm HAPPY and I'm in LOVE with the right man. Mr. Right turned out to be Mr. Forever, and there really isn't more to the story than that...(but I'll elaborate anyway =)  After the End Game I thought, "Okay, a new beginning." We started talking again and it was great. I knew we would be friends and that basically was all that was improtant to me; friendship. However, as YOU know that didn't exactly happen. I mean, it did for a few days, but it quickly became more than that. I was fighting the love I continued to have for you for weeks and months after we broke up, and for a while I really thought it was over...but it wasn't. It never ended because I could not and would not let you go. I loved you far to much to do so, and as I found out, you felt the same way about me. So, where did that leave us in the end?--Reconnecting on that level that we both know so well.   I followed my heart, I really did, and I let it guide me back to the safest, most amazing place I have ever been in; with you. Once I got there [again] I knew this time around I wasn't going to let you go. I know you're also holding on to me. I can feel it when we talk. I can hear it in your voice that you want forever, as I do too with you.  I know you still think about the bad times, as I do sometimes too, but that is sooooooo (notice the extra o's) over with and we can't do anything more but to live in the here & now and forever. We've talked about the future since we reconnected again and I have to say that it looks so crystal clear. Who needs a fortune teller when you know you have THE ONE! I know I'll be with you, but I want you to know that YOU will be with ME as well. And together we'll continue our wonderful love affair and live it and never let it end.  I love you, Mr. Forever. I've always loved you and only you. I love you for being who you are and I love you for being in my life. YOU, my love, are my forever.

       Trust   How do you trust someone? I've been asking myself that question since our discussion last night and my harsh demands that asked for you stay out of the chatrooms. How do you even begin to trust someone, and when you do find trust, how do you know?  This morning I was surprised by my mom and the wonderful breakfast she cooked. Actually, she made it for herself, I just woke up to the aroma of the eggs and toast coming from the kitchen. However, we did have breakfast together and I asked her, how do you trust someone? She was somewhat quiet for a moment as she spread a lite amount of butter on a piece of toast. She looked at me and then responded with, "For me, trust is something that is earned. You can say you trust someone verbally, but it isn't trust unless you feel they are worthy of being trusted. When you feel they are worthy, you'll know they can be trusted."  As I thought about this and how Mike Brady-ish she sounded, I thought back to our discussion again and realized I was wrong. I was ignoring what really matters; that being my love and how I trust you.  Last night, I told you my motivation to keep you away from the chatrooms was jealous-related and that I didn't want you going into the rooms anymore because of it. I was wrong to ask that of you, and I was wrong because I ignored the trust I do have for you. You repeatedly told me you wouldn't do anything that would hurt us or our relationship, and I continued to ignore that and kept demanding that you stay out of the chatrooms. It was very wrong of me to do that and I am very sorry for it. This morning, I realized the trust I have for you should have never been questioned because of my foolish, jealous thoughts that plagued me at that moment.   I'm sorry.  I don't want you to wonder if I trust you when you go into chatrooms, or anywhere for that matter, when I'm not around. I want you to know that I do trust you. I trust you with my life and heart, and I know you would never put our relationship in jeapordy. I trust you enough to make decisions for the both of us and do what is best for our relationship. I trust you because I love you and I know you only want the best for us. I want you to know that I promise I will never question your trust again, no matter how much my foolish jealousy plagues me.  I love you with all my heart and I trust you completely.

       The Cake Incident   I've been so busy! Anyway, I have a story that happened a few months ago. So here it is...  Okay, so my mom decided to throw my grandmother (my mother's mom) a birthday party. My Grams, God bless her heart, turned 79 and was very excited about her birthday bash. So anyway, my mom decided to have a cake made for the birthday celebration. My Grams loves fruit, so my mom ordered a pina colada-type cake; however, to my surprise, and keep in mind that I am never, ever surprised when it comes to my family. My mom had the cake resemble a bible. Yes, a bible. At first, I was very skeptical. I mean, a bible cake? Who in the world wants a bible cake? And, who in their right mind wants to chow down on a pina colada bible cake? Isn't that like, a sin? I mean, sure, the calories are a bitch, but you're eating a bible. A bible! Anyway, I laughed, hard; however, not in the presence of my mother or anyone related to me, God knows I would have gotten a smack down for making fun.  So, my Grams birthday party comes around and my mom has the catering service deliver the cake to her house. She would later take the cake to my Grams house, where the party would be held. The catering service arrives and my mom is just thrilled. I mean, again, a bible cake! A friggin' bible cake! So, the delivery guy shows my mom the cake and she is freaking out because on the way to her house, the friggin' bible cake melted. My mom is horrified, and so is the delivery guy who doesn't know what to do. My mom dials up the catering service and demands to speak to the manager. Minutes later, she is happy again. The catering service agreed to bake her another cake and it should be ready in two hours; however, this time around, my mother wanted to go pick it up herself.  An hour later my mom is at the cake shop, waiting. She got there early just in case something went wrong again. Nothing did, however, the lady there starts an interesting conversation with her and explains how the day had been nothing but cake disasters! And I'm talking about catering/American's funniest home videos/disasters! She goes on and tells my mom that one of the bakers accidently mispelled a name, therefore had to redo an entire birthday cake, and one had accidently put too much sugar in one and didn't know about it until they delivered it and the people complained. However, admist the cake chaos, was another cake incident that just made my mother squirm and thank God for her bible cake. The lady at the bakery showed her proof of their cake disasters, but this was no bible cake. It was an erected penis cake for a female bachelorette party. Yes, thats right. A penis cake! And much like the first bible cake, the penis cake had melted too, making it a penis cake with an erectile disfuntion.  From bible cakes to an erectile disfuntion penis pastry, that's my family, and God damn it, I love them.

       Out and About   I'm gay. Yes, I am a homosexual, and up until recently, I was in the closet. The closet: the one safe haven that protected me from the harsh, straight, outside world that I feared so much for so many years. The closet years were very painful, but during this time, I have to say that I really got to know myself as a person. And that was one of the best things ever to happen to me.  I was around 18 when I really started questioning my sexuality and having desires to be with the same sex. While other 18 year old males were thinking about having sex and getting laid, I was trying to make sense of my life and asking myself why I wasn't doing the "normal" thing. I did have a girlfriend at the time, but it was more of a friendship than a realationship. Trish, my somewhat-girlfriend at the time, was the typical girl, slash, high school sweetheart with big dreams. She was nice and often talked about marriage, kids, the future, etc., with me. I, however, never saw that happening...not with her anyway. After high school, she moved with her family to California and would later move to Nebraska, where she would go to college. Our so-called relationship continued for months after that, but it slowly began to fall apart. Even though time and distance played a role in the destruction of our relationship, it was a minor problem compared to what she demanded from me. Trish wanted what every other straight girl wants: the all-American dream. It was something I knew I could never give to her or to any girl. One spring afternoon she called me long distance from Nebraska and gave me an ultimatum. She asked me to either move with her to Nebraska, or to not bother her anymore. Like a coward, I didn't respond and what we had was soon over.  I was 19 when I faced facts and admitted to myself that I was gay. Shortly after that, I lived in the closet for six, very long stuffy years. I do blame the closet years for my now apparent claustrophobia, but whatever. Being gay will do that to some. And, at the risk of sounding like your typical homosexual, during the closet years I grew very afraid of the world and depression was my once best friend. It was awful, but I survived. I look back now and know that I was mostly afraid of was opening the closet door, taking a step out and showing the world the whole package; me. In a way, coming out, for me, was the last step to becoming a whole person. I feel complete now, comfortable even, in my own skin, and it is a wonderful thing. But, coming out was always easier said than done. I know that for a fact. Even though I look back now and know that I've always been gay, admitting it to myself and coming out were HUGE obstacles to deal with, especially for a clueless teenager.   However, things change when you grow up. As much as I hate to admit it, I'm a grown up...well, sort of. I'm still growing, as a country bumpkin, as a man, and as a person. I think people become bold and fearless with time. I mean, for me, what seem so hard yesterday, like coming out for example, was far more easier to do now as a 24 year old adult. (Props to all my homies who've come out as teens! You got balls, boys...) Anyway, someone (you know who you are!) told me that I'd know when it was time to initiate the coming out process, and he was right. I knew it was time to step up and start living my life, but I'd only be able to do that if I left my safe haven.  So, on August 1, 2003, I opened, or rather, kicked opened, the closet door, jumped out of the closet and came out to my mom, the most important woman in my life. Surprisingly enough, my mom took it well, or at least I think so anyway. She was upset and confused though, and we cried, but we talked about it and moved on. I told her that being gay is not who I am, and it really isn't. I'm a person with the same feelings as the next, and I bleed and I cry just like everyone else. Being gay is simply my sexual preference and it is not the center of my life. My life is about living, learning and being an individual, and not about rainbows, men, and techno-music, and that I consider myself "normal".  (And you can stop laughing now! I am normal, contrarary to what you know about me, I am, dammit!)  My mom replied with how much she loved me. I know she is still a little uncomfortable about me being gay, but when I heard those words come out of her mouth, I knew things would be OK.   I love being the person I am, and I love being out. But don't get me wrong! I still fear the world...some of it anyway. However, something has changed inside of me, and for some reason now, I feel motivated to confront that fear that once held me back, head on. The rest of my life is still waiting for me and I'm going to meet it. So, hello, life! Howyadoin'?!

       Reach Out And Touch Someone, Anyone   Relationships are hard, but long distance relationships are so much harder. Honestly. They are. I would never, ever recommend them unless you feel connected to the person and trust them completely. If you love the person and they love you back, that too will help you because long distance relationships are tough to maintain if both parties are not on the same boat. They can be a total bitch some times too, especially when you feel lonely and want to be in the company of your significant other, but can't because he (or she) is hundreds of miles away. (Probably missing you too!) Anyway, I'm in a long distance relationship with Mr. Forever (the man formally known as Mr. Right) and we have made it a priority to talk everyday. How, you ask? Well, we use a phone, but we've also let modern technology help us with our relationship, and let me tell you, it works. Technology, and all forms of it, has done wonders to help our relationship blossom and connect us on that level of physical touch. Words, as they say, are powerful, and when meant and spoken with sincerity, they will touch you in every way, even over the phone.  Technology is wonderful when you put it to good use. Take computers for example. Computers are amazing little machines. If you have a computer, internet connection, and instant messenger (like Yahoo!, MSN, or AIM), you are set to connect with the world at the comfort of your own home. Both Mr. Right and I use these means for communication on a daily basis. We chat online everyday and stay connected that way. It's great. However, there are times when we both feel lonely and truely yearn to see eachother, so we get connected, Jetson's style. By that, I mean, we both own a web-camera (aka web-cam) and can see eachother via Yahoo Messenger. The web-cam, in my opinion, has revolutionized not only the way people chat online, but how they interact with eachother as well. It's great, but watch out for the nudey people out there! As an experienced chat-user, I've seen people on their web-cams -- literally. Naked men, naked woman, ugly couples, beautiful people, chickens, snakes, tattoos, body piercings, libraries, crappy apartments, beautiful houses, etc., etc..Voyeurism anyone? Yes, but if you don't like it, the web-cam has a turn off feature, which is great. (Only if life was that easy!)   The web-cam has helped my relationship with Mr. Forever a lot. That, combined with our phone conversations and online chats, the actual distance between us isn't so bad. I do miss him though, like now.

       Hey Baby, I'm Going to Vegas!   Yeah, so Mr. Forever and I are meeting for the very first time this coming Friday. I'm extremely excited to see him, mainly because we've been dating for an year now (minus the months/weeks/days?? we were apart) and I know its time to get down to the nitty-gritty. I'm flying to Las Vegas to meet him and I'm kind of excited/nervous/anxious -- mixed bag of emotions, really, because I don't know what's going to happen! I mean, I'm hoping it will go well, but just in case it doesn't (thank-you-very-much-online-dating-show-on-Bravo-with-the-horror-first-dates) I'm prepared to tough it out and just roll with the punches -- err, or something. Anyway, I love him. He knows that. He loves me too, so it'll be okay...I hope. I'm very excited. Wait, I already said that. Okay, I'm bursting with happiness right now! Yeah, much better. Seriously though, I just want to be with my man. I want to tell him how much I really love him, maybe show him how much I really do, too...Oh, I'm bad. Yeah, totally evil. Las Vegas. Holy crap! Wow. I can't wait!  Vegas! Woo-Hoo! Here I come!

       Story of a boy, who met Mr. Right, who turned into Mr. Forever   Introduction: I've had a few incredible months since my last entry. I met Mr. Forever for the first time back in October. And, I spent one week getting to know him up close and personal, and it coincided with my 25th birthday. But, before I go any further, I want to confess something first. I do it only because I am head over heels in love with an incredible and charming man, who I have nicknamed Mr. Forever (formally Mr. Right). My confession is as follows: I will forever hold dearly in my heart and cherish the memories of the days leading up to my 25th birthday and the week that followed. It was an important part of my life that I had the privilege of sharing with the man I absolutely admire and love. I can honestly say that meeting Mr. Forever sealed the deal, and by that I mean, being with him felt so natural and right, and being without him, hurts in every way.   Now, because these moments I'm about to talk about have a lot of detail, I have decided to break them down into short scenes. And, at the risk of sounding like a geek-movie-buff-with-no-life-and-plenty-of-time, I will admit that I view some parts of my life like a movie, with an introduction and ending. I sometimes even go as far as creating a list of music for the soundtrack of my life's movie, which is absolutely crazy, but I write in a BLOG, so whatever. Anyway, this is where it begins:  Scene 1 - The Airport Meeting Mr. Forever for the first time in Las Vegas was the most intense and frightening thing I have ever done so far in my little country boy life. When the plane was landing on the runway, I was literally shaking with anticipation and had first-day-of-school-jitters too. It was a mix bag of emotions, really. But over all I was excited to see the man that I confessed my love to so many months ago.  After waiting at baggage claim for a few million minutes, I decided to call him on his cell phone. I already had my bag in hand and was just waiting for him to pick me up, but he was nowhere to be found. He wasn't answering his cell, so naturally I got really scared. I mean, the Las Vegas airport is massive in size, and watching people go on with their lives while I stand there, waiting, well, lets just say it is very nerve wrecking. Anyway, after hanging up my cell phone, I turn to look back and low and behold there he is, Mr. Forever, walking toward me with a serious look on his face. I was in actual awe-land. Totally. I mean, he's a lot taller than what I had thought and far more handsome in person. Deep down inside of me I went "wow" and hugged him when we met. It was so casual too. I had played out this scene millions of times in my head, and I have to say that is was far more subtle that what I had originally planned. But don't get me wrong. Subtle is good. It was actually kind of perfect, considering later on in the evening we would eventually play out my original plan. Anyway, he has the most beautiful blue eyes that just made me want to hug him again and never let go. It was then that I knew why I loved him so much. (And no, not because of his eyes -- just him.) His existence alone is to be admired.  Scene 2 - The Drive Home The drive to Mr. Forever's house was very pleasent. We talked casually and I stared out the window, trying to be very cool and suave over my nervous, stuttering and muttering nature. I was actually mesmorized by the mountains at a distance. Coming from a small town in Texas, seeing those mountains made me realize that there was a whole other world outside of Texas. It was incredible. So anyway, I loved the mountains and I loved the scenery, but so did Mr. Forever. He, however, wasn't looking out the window and instead was looking at me. He was checking me out from head to toe (no doubt!) and wearing sunglasses to conceal his obvious staring. I was somewhat uncomfortable by it, but that changed when I did it right back to him and made him blush. "Ha. Two can play this game!" I thought to myself with a noticable snicker. He told me I was very handsome, and in my own little way, blushed and muttered "oh chucks" to myself. The ice of nervousness was breaking and I knew it was only a matter of time now before I (we?) felt comfortable with eachother.  Scene 3 - Mi Casa Es Tu Casa I thought he lived in a house, but not so when we pulled up into the garage of a fairly nice apartment. I could tell a man lived there because I saw power tools in the garage. After grabbing my oversized bag from the trunk, Mr. Forever welcomed me into his sanctuary. It was nicely furnished and tidey. He has two cats, one I was somewhat scared of, and another, an actual black cat that I thought was beautiful. Unfortunately, the black cat was shy and didn't come out to say hi until later in the evening. Anyway, after taking my bag upstairs, I return to the living room and take a seat on the couch. Mr. Right sat down beside me. He brought with him two glasses of water and a little snack; chips and salsa, my favorite, to snack on.  We talked for a few minutes about my trip and the airplane ride, as well as other topics that quickly turned into things about me and him, and, well, the conversation went on for a while. He was also moving closer to me on the couch, which didn't scare me, but made me a tad bit nervous. He had a look in his blue eyes that revealed so much, so I knew something was happening. Hugging and being close to him was inevitable, and to resist I just couldn't. He gently touched my arm and hand, and I loved every second of what was happening. The closeness, the affection, it would soon become so much more.  Scene 4 - The Kiss I closed my eyes and tilted my head slightly. I then felt his breath and soft lips touch mine. It was amazing and one for the record books. We kissed on the brown, comfortable couch like two teenagers in a cheesey 80's teen movie. However, it was my cheesey 80's teen movie, so I didn't care. When his hand touched mine and his lips caressed my lips, I felt so close to heaven. It was bliss. I could feel his breath and taste his lips; I love being in love, and I love him for being there with me. His kisses were so heartfelt. I returned them as best as I could. Like I said, the kissing went on for a few hours, or rather, until we got hungry. (My stomach growled -- I was so embaressed!) We continued to kiss and I continued to record everything and create precious memories of my time with him. (To share with the world on my BLOG! eek!)  Scene 5 - Dinner For Two, AKA The Whole Enchillada So a week before I left for Vegas, we decided to cook something in the kitchen and have a nice dinner for two. After making out on the couch, we headed off into the kitchen for some serious cooking. However, before this, I accidently spilled my glass of water on the carpet, making a big mess in the living room. Oops! Words can not describe the horror after I did this! But wait, after I spilled my glass, I spilled his too! The living room carpet was soaked! I'm such a clutz. These things always happen to me, mind you. Its crazy! Anyway, after cleaning it up, we started cooking. Mexican is what we had decided on, so we cooked chicken enchilladas. (They were easy to do and quite tasty too!) I made him some home made mexican rice, just like my mama makes, and he enjoyed it. He set the table, lit some candles, put on some music, and we had the nicest, romantic dinner--EVER. It ended with dessert, strawberry cake with icing, but in a way, kind of kick-started the night. I tinkered with some strawberries on the cake and fed them to him. (And yeah, women everywhere you can totally hate me now!) Anyway, what followed after dinner would surely change my life forever.  Scene 6 - Slumber In His Bed, Lights Out In Vegas Well, I knew from the get-go we would be sharing a bed. I was kind of excited about sharing it too. But, after some serious making out, it got pretty intense. It was so intense that we simply couldn't resist anymore. We made love and it was absolutely one of the greatest experiences in my life. I don't know what more to say about it. We kissed, we touched, we held eachother--it was passionate and sexy, hot and very, very romantic. Making love with him was worth the wait. (We waited a year!) Jessica Simpson eat your heart out!  Scene 7 - The Morning After Any regrets? None whatsoever! Waking up in his arms was a dream come true, for both of us mind you! We made love again and really connected on the level lovers do. It was hot...    Scene 8 - Fast Forward Some, Stop, Rewind, Play; Party Time! So it's Sunday, October 12th, 2003. It's my 25th birthday and I'm with the man I love. We start the day by doing some sight seeing, and where else to go than to visit the historic Hover Dam. We visit the Hover Dam and take the "Dam Tour" -- apparently the employees there have made the "Dam Tour" the butt of many jokes, some of which I found very enjoyable, too. Anyway, after a long day of sight seeing and taking in Nevada's rocky beauty, he head back to his casa and get dressed for dinner. Because its such a special night, (it's my birthday, hello!) we decide to get somewhat dressed up, aka, wear evening clothes for dinner. We didn't have to, but we did. (I wanted to see him in a suit!) We left his flat around 7:45 and arrived at a small, elegant resturant called the Tillerman a short while late. It was beautiful! The building's architecture incorported actual growing trees into the resturant's dinning floor, creating an earthy-elegant-atmosphere. Anyway, I ordered a chicken breast, (the world's best in my book!) and he had the New York steak. Dinner was stunningly beautiful and tasty, and we ate and talked, like two lovers in love. It was classic and a dream come true for me. (Inifinty points for Mr. Forever too! He had reservations and kept the conversation going through out dinner!) I felt so loved and knew he was getting lucky tonight! *hehehe*  Scene 9 - In Your Arms, I Bathe The night didn't end with dinner. After dinner we decided to check out the light show at one of the casinos. The light show was beautiful and very partiotic. After that, we headed to the Paris hotel and took a ride up to the viewing deck at the Effiel tower. We got a bit dizzy on the way there, but when we reached the top and stepped out on the deck, we knew it had been totally worth it. We got an amazing view of Las Vegas at night. It was beautiful and breath taking. I loved it. After that, we went home. Mr. Forever prepared a nice, warm bath for us and, oh my God, it was absolutely amazing! The night ended when we made love and he embraced me in his arms. I was in the safest place on earth and with the one I love. How perfect is that!  Scene 10 - Leaving Las Vegas After spending every minute and hour of the day with Mr. Forever, it was time for me to go home. I started to feel the pressure with leaving. I mean, I didn't know when we were going to see eachother again and that scared me. I didn't want to go, but I had too, so the last day with him was sad. He, however, had a plan up his sleeve. On our last day together, he gave me a set of house keys. I was stunned and baffled, but he explained how he wanted me to move in with him. Again, I was stunned and baffled, and cried like a grown man baby! I accepted, of course! I mean, how could I not? I love him so much and him asking me sealed the deal in our relationship. We're taking another step and we're doing it together.   EPILOGUE: So a week from today I'm officially a former native of Texas. I'm moving to Las Vegas to be with the man that I love. I'm starting a new chapter in my little country boy life and I'm really excited too! I really hate to rub it in, but I'm happy. I bleed happiness. It oozes out of me now. I can't wait to be with Mr. Forever again. Everything is perfect, and like they say here in my-former-native-land, Texas, life is good.  THE END

       Happy New Year!   I have to say that I was kind of scared spending the New Year here in Las Vegas. The terrorist plots and frequent use of the words "possible target" and "high alert" when the city was mentioned scared the crap out of me. Good thing nothing happened. Everything went down fine. A lot of people got drunk, wasted, arrested, saw fireworks, spent a lot of money, and then went home to their over priced hotel rooms to sleep and then wake up with a bitch of a hangover. Lets do it again next year!   I spent the evening with Mr. Forever and watched the festivities on the local tv station. The strip was jam-packed with people and it looked extremely crowded to me. I bet it was fun. I should have gone. Damn you terrorist people for scaring me! I don't think I would have lasted though. I mean, it was  very, very   cold . And the screaming crowd and drunk people would have pissed me off. I'm glad I stayed home. I spent the evening with my man and fell asleep on his lap as we watched tv. He did wake me up in time for the countdown, and we kissed like all lovers do when they ring in the New Year together.  Anyway, got to go. I'm thinking of cooking tonight. Meatloaf anyone? I'm really in the mood for it. We'll see.

       New Year's Resolutions   1) Get healthy and eat well 2) Exercise 3) Get washboard abs 4) Read and write more 5) Use brain more (or at least half of it)  Okay, so I know it is useless to try, but I will give it another try again this year. What am I talking about, you ask? Well, I'm talking about New Year's resolutions, and if you're like me and millions of other people, you will probably toss the resolutions out the window after a week of trying to stick to them. No one evers sticks to their New Year's resolutions. God knows I never have. I do wonder why though. I mean, is it such an impossible task to accomplish? Why are a couple of resolutions so difficult to maintain? Well, I don't know the answer to that, but I have learned several things about making them. For one, I never make more than five resolutions. This is because past experiences reveal that the more resolutions you have the harder they are to remember and accomplish them all. Its true. Five is my limit. Make more than five and you are headed for disappointment, my dear. Just wait until next year rolls around and you are like, "why do I keep making resolutions when I know I will never accomplish them? So don't make so many. Thats my advice.   Okay, so mine are a bit tame. Yeah, I know. They aren't that extreme, but again they are this way for a reason. Most of them focus on looking good and getting healthy, which I am, but I can do better. Then again, who doesn't want wshboard abs?? Anyway, over the holidays, I gained a little weight....   Okay, I lied. I gained a lot of weight! However, I'm on a diet now, or rather, "making a change" as Mr. Forever put it. I'm getting healthy and took on the Slim-Fast diet. Dumb? Noway. One shake for breakfast, another for lunch, and a sensible dinner. Nothing but that! Sounds simple, huh? Its not. Its a struggle, and I'm hungry!! I'm hanging in there though, and so far its been good. (fingers crossed!) Anyway, I really hope I can stick to my resolutions. I am NOT weak. I am NOT weak! Really, I'm not. *sigh*

       Happy Valentine's Day!  Or rather, belated Happy Valentine's Day. *hehehe*  Either way, this year's V-Day was different for me. For the first time ever, I spent V-Day with someone, or should I say,  my sweetheat . Yes, my sweetheart! I know, I know -- I'm bragging, but whatever. I can so I will. And I will because usually, in the past, I've spent Valentine's Day alone, watching some old romantic movie, and depressed about my so-called love life. This year, however, it's totally different. I mean, Mr. Forever surprised me with a few gifts, including flowers and candy. Cuteness! But I'll go into that later. First, I want to talk about what I gave him.  The day started at night really, on Valentine's eve. After having a really close and enjoyable moment with my man, we decided to go out to dinner. We went to a nice little mexican joint and had a great dinner there. I had a strawberry margarita, so I was in heaven. Anyway, later, we went cologne shopping. I really wanted to get him a scent, and by that I mean, something to represent his aroma. Silly, I know, but I have one in the form of Calvin Klein's "Truth". Anyway, after looking around I decided on Dior's "High Energy". I've never liked Dior, too strong for me, but High Energy is a bit less harsh on the nose, and tolerable. I sprayed it on Mr. Forever and he loved it. I was happy and so was he. He now has a scent. (And I love it!)  After getting home we decided to turn in. While in bed, he somewhat mentioned to me he had gotten me something, and I was like,  really?  -- BIG mistake, bubby pal! It instantly made me wonder what he had gotten me. I mean, you can't just tell someone you got them something and leave it at that. Oh hell no! No, no, no, no, nooo! No sir! Not with me you can't! And since it was already Valentine's Day, I was like, you can give it to me now. Yes, now! Now, now, now, now!  And he did.  I got some cute boxers (yeah, cute holiday ones!), a bouquet of roses, and some chocolate candy (yummm!) in a heart shaped box mind you. Cuteness all around! And, call me weird, but for the first time ever, I felt normal. I mean, this is what normal people do, right? They get sweets from their sweetearts and get told how much they are loved on the most romantic day of the year. Wow! I've never felt so wonderful. Being in love is truely amazing, and this V-day was one to remember always. Happy Valentine's Day, y'all! Hope you had a good one!

      Okay, so I know it's been a while, but I've been busy. And before I go all guttermind and stuff, let me just say that I changed the look to the blog, added some stuff, etc., because I revamped my website and wanted it to match.  A n y w a y, I must confess, I've been naughty/BAD, BAD, BAD! One of the greatest perks about having a significant other and being in a mature/intimate relationship is that you get to have sex.  WHAT?! SEX? Whatchoo' talkin' 'bout, Willis?!   Umm, yes, sex. Currently Mr. Forever and I have been active lil'bunnies, and it's been amazing. The thing he does with his... and then with the... followed by... ummm, okay. Just kidding! Actually, it has been good and amazing. I mean, when the moment comes and we are holding eachother, there is nothing in the world that I can compare it to. It's bliss and it's me and him, together, sharing the moment. Sex is great! However, don't go out and do it just because I think it is amazing. Oh no! No, no, no, no! Make sure you're ready. It's a lot more amazing when there is love between you and your partner. Trust me. It's more than sex. It's love.

      It's been 6 months since I move to Vegas to be with Mr. Forever. And I got to say that in our time together it's been near perfect. It really has. I really enjoy his company and cherish the times we spend together. I know, I know. I'm sounding like a love-struck-fool again. But I am, so YOU must deal with it. Plus, it's my diary and I will talk about ME ME ME if I choose to! Anyway, I know its been a while since I've post anything, and I've really been meaning too, but I've been somewhat busy. That, and I've had a bad case of writer's block. But I'm writing something now, so thats good. I'm watching 'Mommie Dearest' and simlutaneously writing this. Why do I love this movie? Anyway, 6 months in Vegas and I'm not a junkie/trampy/prostitute hoe! Yay me! Here's to 6 more months!  (update: Someone asked me how the sex was, and if it had decreased since I started living with Mr. Forever. Well, let me start off by saying NO. No, it has not decreased. We do whoopie way to much, really. (Whoa, did I say 'whoopie'? I'm 25 damn years old! I meant, sex! SEX! It's called SEX now!) It's kind of scary. I mean, I don't want to sound (or make us sound) like [a] sex-crazed freak(s), but sex is good everytime, especially twice a day.)

      I made some updates on my website, finally! I know, I know. Anyway, I added a SHOUTBOX to the start page, which is cool and easy to use. I hope it looks good. I might end up taking it off if it sucks! I'm also doing a music review entry, but I don't know when I'll get done with that. I might just drop the music page altogether and post the reviews here. I've been listening to a lot of music lately, and it ranges from old-school Sinatra, to heavy metal Strata! Anyway, enjoy!
