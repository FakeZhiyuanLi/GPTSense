      Ok I looked around the site and having gathered a slightly better idea of what I am suppose to do, have come back for round two. By the way, the creepy guy with the Blog about how he is Jesus, You need therapy. Actually I suppose in a way blogging is a type of therapy for you guys (hey im one of your guys now!) but I find it a bit hard to write everything and anything wrong in my life on the internet... not the most trust worthy thing in the world. Actually I don't trust the internet at all - its insane! You know what I have figured out? Eventually people's ideas of dating and friendship will revolve so much around the internet that no one will ever go out... pretty sad eh? There wont be pub gatherings or anything, instead there will be 'net pubs' where people meet up and log on at a certain time to chat. Eventually people will be getting married over the net! With webcams replacing the actual being-at-the-church part of the wedding, afterall that is really just a minor part of it anyway... The problems come along when the priest's, who obvioulsy isn't up with the times (and still on dial-up), connection fails and the webcam vows cut off half way through... leaving both the bride and groom stuck at the alter (or the desk chair). Not that people haven't found happiness on the internet. A friend's sister met her boyfriend on the internet, and although I would still never do anything like that, they are both still very happy I think (their internets gone so I cant talk to them anymore [haha])  Well I think I might go to bed now... I really am quite tired and I think I have amused you enough with my wonderful sense of humour... I'm a typical Bob hope..  For the second time (and hopefully not the last) this is Oh-So-Cate logging off!

      Well, well, well. Here I am, once more following yet another trend that has shooted off in recent months. Of course this sheep-like-following of crazy fads isn't something I do all the time. In fact the last time it happened was when I was in 6th Grade, and that was with Pokemon Cards (what are pokemon you say? Don't worry you are probably best not remembering) but then again before that was the hopscotch faze, the marbles, the yoyos oh and lets not forget those wonderful novels, Goosebumps. *sigh* Now once again I have been drawn into a crazy faze, but not because "all the cool kids at school are doing it" but because I just don't know anything about Blogs, and I don't like being left out of the loop. I know curiosity kills the cat but finding out the answer brings it back, right? Or at least something along those lines. So if what I have been rambling on about is not what I am suppose to be rambling on about then please someone point it out and tell me what I am suppose to be rambling about... because I have zilch of an idea. Ok thats sorted. I guess I should start of this momentus (wrong spelling? Meh) occasion by talking about myself. Ok! My name is Cate. I am a typical 16 year old. Pessemistic, confused and altogether pretty funny and weird in the eyes of others. I live in Sydney, Australia and that's about all that I have to tell at the moment... Wow don't I live an exciting life...
