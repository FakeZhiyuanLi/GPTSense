      I guess its been about 10 days since I've updated.  But it doesn't really matter cuz not a whole lot has been going on I guess.  It's Friday, again.  And again, I'm stuck at home doing nothing.  I'm so pissed today and I don't know why.  Zak's been acting really weird.  All of a sudden he talks to me and has been giving me high fives... ever since I told him I listened to 10 minutes of this Slipknot special thing on the radio.  but i just found out now that corey taylor, the singer for stone sour, was in slipknot.  and jim root was the guitarist for slipknot and stone sour too.  but i gotta get offline soon...  i've been on forever and i have to record the simpsons.  its gonna be the episode about bart writing to his teacher calling himself woodrow (named after woodrow wilson the president)

      Today my team had a science field trip to devils lake.  thursday is the other teams trip there.  we went to devils lake.  the hike was really tough up the steep rocks.  it took forever and was really exhausting.  at least the guys butts were there to motivate me and cassie.  james is really sexy;)  haha on the bus adam (he's really dumb) poured water on randys pants and on his white shirt.  so he got nip rock and it looked like he wet his pants.  randy laughs really weird.  he laughs with his mouth open wide and makes a funny noise.  zak was ok too.  hes usually really annoying though.  but he does know a lot about music, so its fun talking to him.  james knows about music too, but hes just better to talk to.  Glass Jaw by Systematic is a good song that I'm listening to right now.  My sister had a 30 second clip of it on the computer and i finally found out what it was cuz it was just titled a number.  Saturday night i did go to brittanys dance recital.  they played sweet child o mine but sheryl crow sang it.  they also had some really shitty songs like backstreet boys and other crap.  it was 3 hours long..  but chris k. made it all worth it.  me and cassie were staring at him for the longest time, but he actually saw us looking so we couldnt look anymore..  and alex and matt were in the row behind us headbanging.  it was hilarious though.  cassie spent the night and then sunday we went to church becuz thomas (tom) is usually there.  he wasn't though.  then me and lisa (my sister...) went shopping.  we didn't even get to do what we went there for which was returning shoes for my concert outfit.  but i did get about 6 shirts and one pair of kakis (however you spell it).  they're not the ones that go tight to your legs, so i like them.  we got lisa another cell phone from cingular.  so she has one from at&t and cingular.  she was going on the family plan so she could share it with her boyfriend since she calls him the most.  once we got the 2 cute little flip phones, it was time to leave so i get back in time for religion (thank god it was my last night)  we were crossing the bridge to get back into sauk and then the phone didn't get service anymore.  so lisa is gonna take the phones back.  but she was gonna let me use one for the week since she decided trevor didn't need his for a little bit.  lol.  then i dont remember what i did on monday really... but it was a boring day.  it stormed a lot at night though.  i was interviewing my grandma on the great depression and my dad and i were gonna leave but then we stayed 2 extra minutes and we got outside just when it was pouring down rain.  the lightning was really bad too.  but we got out alive.  then i had to wait an extra hour to take my shower.  it was alright though.  today was the field trip, really boring.  james found some marijuana leaves. and tomorrow i dont have class again because i have 4 band concerts all day long and we all get to go out to eat for lunch.  thats gonna be the only fun part really.  and missing class.  but thats about it MJ

      I went to bed at 2 last night and i woke up at noon.  :(  In 3 hours I have to go to my cousins graduation party and then we eat at 5, and it ends at 7.  I dont wanna go at all.  It's gonna suck.  But I hope i get back before 7 so i can go to brittany's dance recital.  The party is going to be so boring.  I should just stay home, but I have to go.  I have to take a shower, but I can't until my clothes are done washing and put into the dryer so i can change into something when i get out. Then tomorrow I have to go to church at 10:30 in the morning, then for my english homework i have to interview my grandma about the depression.  & at 6:30 i have to go to religion..which is really really boring.  but it's the last one.  there's also a high school band concert at 7 too.  i wanna go to that to see the major hot drummers..and a tuba player.. but at least i'll see the tuba player at church.  This weekend just sucks.  our washer sucks.  it keeps stopping so i have to keep restarting it.  i guess i dont really have anything else to say..  MJ

      When did life get so boring?  It's a Friday night and I'm home yet again.  Nothing much has happened lately.  Except I did my normal Friday night cleaning.  It's freaky.  Every Friday night I just happen to be in the mood to clean my room.  It's a surprise how much crap a person can use during a week.  I'm gonna have a band concert next week Wednesday and Thursday night.  During the day Wednesday I have to perform 4 concerts for grades younger than me.  The part when I don't have to play is going to be fun, and the part when we get to go out to eat.  I really like my concert outfit.  It's one of those white poofy skirts and a black tank topish shirt.  Lisa just went shopping to buy me some black shoes tonight.  She picked up 3 pairs for me to choose from.  But I won't get to see them until tomorrow night.  I hope she found some good ones.  But in the mean time, I'm doing nothing.

      Im bored again!!  Now I'm listening to Little Know It All by Iggy Pop..  its a good song.  There's hardly ever gonna be a time when Im not bored.  brittany (a friend) is in a dance recital tonight and im not going to it.  i couldn't find anyone to go with.  so im gonna go tomorrow night at 7 instead.  she's gonna dance to livin on a prayer by bon jovi.  i forgot which other 2 songs she's dancing to.  probly cuz bon jovi is the best one.  i went to 2 of his concerts already.  he's awesome live.  he actually sounds like he does on the cd.  he just gets the crowd going.  at the first concert of his i saw the goo goo dolls.  they were alright.  i never really listened to their cd so i didn't know many of the songs.  the lead singer was an ass.  he kept complaining about being on tour and how much he just wanted to go home.  then at the 2nd concert i saw sheryl crow.  she was actually nice.  but i dont really like her music.  i also saw carolines spine in concert.  they were at the taste of madison.  so they're concert was free.  i only knew 2 songs by them, but i wanted to go to a concert, so i went with my 2 sisters.  it was kinda funny because a guy who was 22 tried hitting on lisa.  if i went to the taste of madison one day earlier i could have seen v-shaped mind.  2 guys from my school saw them.  i like them a whole lot better than carolines spine.  nick, the guy i like who went to v-shaped mind thinks carolines spine is "an aquired taste".  i had him burn me the v-shaped mind cd cuz the only song i heard was "monsters"  which is a pretty good song.  but they have some other good tracks too.

      Well this is my first time actually making a blog, so I'm new to this.  My teachers are so dumb sometimes.  Each teacher for the main subjects gave us a bunch of homework all due tomorrow.  It's like they're all trying to plot against us.  Right now I'm listening to a song called California Songs by Local H.  It's a pretty good song, so check it out.  Lately I've been wanting to go to a concert.  So I asked Cassie, one of my friends if they could go to Projekt Revolution Aug. 27.  Her mom actually said yes.  So we were planning on seeing KoRn (one of my favorite bands) Linkin Park, Snoop Dogg, and The Used.  The only problem was getting a ride there.  I asked my oldest sister Jenny who's 23 to take me.  It turns out that she's going on a trip with her ex-boyfriend the next day, so she doesn't wanna go.  Then I asked my other sister Lisa who's 18 to take me.  She just told me she doesn't like KoRn.  She won't go either.  I know my parents won't take me because it's about a 2 1/2 hour drive.  I guess I'll just have wait until they come out with another cd and come closer to me.  But for now I have to finish my homework.  I couldn't figure out how to get back to this draft, so i couldn't publish it yesterday, the 13, so its actually from yesterday, not today (the 14)

      Hey anyone who's reading my blog, which might be noone.  I haven't updated in awhile.. again.  I always forget to or i have nothing to update.  But Monday I had a marching band party that started at 3-6:30 when we had to go to marching band.  Me and Cassie had my mom drop us off at the party.  We had some food and then played volley ball with some really hot seniors.  I just watched though.. even if i was playing, i wouldn't have helped much.  they put in some music and at first we listened to limp bizkit.  some of the songs were ok, but otherwise i dont really like limp.  then Tom, the senior that i guess you could say i like, but i dont know if i do or not, (who still has his girlfriend named alex who is a grade older than him) put in bob marley.  jammin is my favorite song on that cd.  we listened to practically the whole cd, and then we listened to tool, i think it was the lateralus cd, or whichever one has the person on the front with their legs behind their head.... haha head.  because tom said he wished he could do that and then he wouldn't be as lonely anymore.  this was when he was playing euquer with all senior guys, only 4 total.  on toms team was chris, another hottie, then on the other team was a guy named derrick with t.j. who is decent..  then tom said something about how chris was masturbating with his leg, so then of course, with toms personality, he showed us.  haha.  then chris put in the black eyed peas and we listened to 'lets get retarded' and tom was making fun of chris and the song.  after their game was done, t.j. got up and then tom asked if any of us wanted to start another game.. nobody really moved.  it was me, stacy (blllllahh), cassie, and some other freshmen there too.  so after about 30 seconds, chris said that they actually wouldn't have time for another game since we'd have to leave to go to band soon.  some other girl sat down just to sit, she's a little odd i guess you could say, and tom told her that they wouldn't have time for another game actually.  i think he said that so he wouldn't have to sit by her.... i dont know.  possibly.  Tom was asking people if they needed a ride over to the high school and i was standing there so i got a ride in his ford taurus:D:D:D   Which just happens to be the same kind of car that my dad has because i picked it out for him to buy:D  hehehe.  he had mudvayne blaring in the car.  it was great.  it was the l.d. 50 cd.  he looked so good singing the 1, 2, 3, part in internal primates forever.  i gotta go now though, its "just shoot me" time.

      Well it's about 4:50 right now.  I'm waiting for the 5 o'clock friday song to come on the radio.  I didn't go to bed until 3 this morning, and then i woke up at 10.  i watched the price is right until 11.  somebody could've won a mustang, but they didn't.  I went out to eat with my mom and sister in madison for chinese.  the food was alright, but the drive made me sick.  i'm taking a survey on music for a radio station that is copying my favorite station.  it pissed me off so much.  so i'm saying the opposite of what i like so they play crap and people won't listen to them anymore and then they're be gone.  I got to talk to Cassie in texas today too.  it made my day.  i haven't talked to her since sunday morning.  last night at kayser, they had a premiere night for the new dodges that they got in.  they had a door prize.  my dads name was called and we didn't even know it because a little kid was announcing them.  there was four things left, a weather radio, a cd player/radio, a headphones cd player, and then something else too.  my dad wanted the weather thing and i wanted the cd player even though we already have like 6 of them.  we got the cd player.  he likes it becuz they're digital sound.  there were two girls at the chinese place that kept looking at me weird.  and then bon jovi "livin on a prayer" came on the radio & me and lisa started singing.  it was lots of fun.  WAHOO!! the song's on:D pass it to me baby, pass it to me slow.... blah blah..... the song's about doing drugs.  haha.  it's on every friday at 5, i think i already said that...:S   MJ

      Well the last day I could post was Saturdsay the 12.  It was the only real day I had access to a computer.  On Sunday after church where I saw Tom and Luke play the guitar, I went to Lisa's house.  I stayed there until 7:00 this morning.  Jenny came and picked me up since she was going back into town to work anyways.  I don't remember much of what I actually did at Lisa's.  But I went to work with her two times and met a lot of people there.  Lisa got paid to go get food and take cars from one car dealership, to adealership on the other side of town.  I got to go with her too.  We also watched a couple of movies at her house.  We went shopping two times, the first time Jenny came with, the second she didn't.  We ate breakfast at IHOP-International House of Pancakes, or as Lisa and I said, International House of PANTIES!!  Monday's my first day of Marching Band, Cassie's still in Texas, so I won't have any friends that I know of there with me.  So that's gonna suck.   MJ

      well tuesday was my last day and a half day.  we had yearbook signing and graduation ceremonys.  the ceremony part was soooo boring.  after school brittany was having her party.  well.... it was boring at first until me cassie and ally left to go to tyler and joes house.  then for awhile i forgot about brittany's house and the other people.  we played twister at tylers house.  it was funny.  then the rest of brittanys people came over because they were done watching their movie & being boring.  once they all came it started to get boring.  before they came, tyler made us play truth or dare.  we made him lick the tile floor and write his name on it.  that was funny.  we all left joes and went on the trampoline... i don't remember much else, but it wasn't all that great.  the mosquitoes were a bitch though.  at about 9 10 some of us went to toilet paper and silly string luke's house.  at about 12 the next day britts mom took the 3 of us home becuz everybody else left at 10 the night before.  but today, saturday, my dad and i took lisa back home.  i'm gonna spend a couple of days at her house after tomorrow.  today i mowed the lawn and was gonna go outside to tan.  but by the time i got out there, the sun wasn't shining much anymore.  so i went to take a shower.  its been a really boring summer so far.  i hope i can get a hold of my references soon for my job so i can start working.  then in a week i start marching band.. so there i can see tom and chris.  but tom got a new girlfriend i think.  and she's in his grade.  he did have a senior girlfriend, but she graduated & "long distance relationships don't last" thats all for now i guess mj

      Well today was Monday and my school went to a waterpark.  It was about 80 degrees at 10 a.m. so I'm not sure on the temp. the rest of the day.  There was this one guy that Cassie me and Britt kept running into.  It was kinda funny.  So after the 7th time seeing him, and him probably think we're stalking him, I decided that if we saw him 2 more times, we would ask him and his friends to go down a 5 person ride.  We saw him 3 more times and actually did ask.  They actually said yes.. He had 2 friends so we were a total of 6, but Brittany left us for some other people.  So then there was 5.  It was kinda fun.  Then we had to go because our buses were waiting for us.  It wasn't that sunny out even, so I got a little tan on my face and shoulders, not even a burn.  But tomorrow's graduation for 8th grade and I'm gong to wear a white poofy skirt.  I like it.  It's a half day and then Brittany's having an end of school party so Cassie, me, and some other people are going to spend the night.  Joe, next door is also having a party.  He's inviting Marcus, who's going out with Cassie, so that'll be interesting.  I have to remember to bring some cd's to Britts house otherwise jumping on the trampoline won't be as fun.  I have to take a shower though, because I have chlorine in my hair still.  MJ

      Well its Saturday.  I slept in until noon again.  Then I went online until 12:45 and my Dad came home from work and asked me if I wanted to go to a graduation party.  I only went because there was going to be food.  So I got in the shower and started getting ready.  Then Cassie called.  I finished painting my toenails and once my parents were ready I got off the phone and we left.  When we first got there, we couldn't find a parking spot, so we had to back up in a driveway.  In the driveway, there was 2 hot brothers with their shirts off.  They were so sexy;)  Then we were at the party for about 1 1/2 hours and we left at 3:30.  Once I got home I went back online.  I blasted the radio because my parents left again to go to church and a 20 year thing of being a priest party.  They're still there now.  But I cleaned my room too.  It wasn't that messy to begin with though.  I'm also scanning my computer for viruses because I get so many from WinMx I think.  I'm not even half way through the scan and I already have 38.  Jeez.. but I already got rid of two.  It's going to take awhile too.  It sucks.  So now I'm going to clean off the viruses and get some food. MJ

      Wow, I haven't posted in awhile again.  I guess sometimes I think of it, but then when I can I just forget to post.  I can't even view it though, I think it might be something wrong with my computer... not sure though.  But last weekend, me and Lisa (sister) went out to eat 3 times and spent a total of 75 bucks.  We had soo much fun.  We laughed a lot.  I even spit out my shake I got because I was laughing so much.  But then Monday I had no school.  Tuesday through Thursday was just boring.  But today, Friday, was kinda fun.  Well, yesterday we got our yearbooks since Tuesday is our last day of school.  Monday the school is going to a waterpark and it's supposed to be 81 degrees outside.  Anyways, today some people were signing yearbooks and I went up to Nick (remember thats who I like) and I signed his yearbook... But I'm not a person who's that outgoing to tell him I like him in there.  And since Becky told me I should, I had her write it in there by hers so she told him whatever she did and then said P.S. MJ thinks your hot.  Then I guess in art class, which is the class Cassie, Becky, and Nick have together, Nick said I was cute and we like the same music.  I'm not exactly sure if he was just saying that to be nice though.. and what he meant by the music part.  But we do like the same music.  But it made me very happy to find out that he thought I was cute.  I'm not sure if he likes me though.  I hope so.  In most of my classes we watched movies and then the last 10-20 minutes of class we signed yearbooks.  In social studies we got to sign the whole hour because Mr. T decided that we worked so hard throughout the year.  I can't wait until Monday and the waterpark.  Last year it was really fun, but cold.  Since its gonna be warm it should be a really nice day.  Then Tuesday my grade is having 2 hours for yearbook signing.  But I already had everybody who I wanted sign my yearbook.  Me and Cassie filled 2 pages of eachothers books already.  It's really funny though.  I guess thats about it.. MJ

        Well, I haven't posted since July 5.&nbsp; So it's been awhile, but a fun while it's been.&nbsp; Yesterday, Saturday July 24, was awesome.&nbsp; Probably the best day of my life so far.&nbsp; I was at JJO Band Camp.&nbsp; The radio station 94.1 JJO had 8 national bands and 5 local bands to come and play on willow island.&nbsp; I saw Dropbox, Skillet, Flaw, Earshot, Dope, Drowning Pool, Damageplan, and Saliva.&nbsp; At first, I had only heard one song from Dropbox, Wishbone.&nbsp; Its a pretty good song.&nbsp; After seeing them live, I found out that they have some other good songs too.&nbsp; So I've been thinking about buying their cd.&nbsp; Next up was Skillet.&nbsp; The singer guy was kind of hot.&nbsp; But his wife was one of the guitar players...&nbsp; The drummer was also a girl.&nbsp; She wore a Bon&nbsp;Jovi t-shirt, which was my first 2 concerts, so that was kinda cool.&nbsp; They're best song was "Savior."&nbsp; They have a couple of other good songs like "My Obsession" and "Forsaken."&nbsp; They are more of a Christian Rock band though.&nbsp; I had only heard one song from Flaw too, and that was "Recognize" which is a slower song.&nbsp; So I thought that Flaw would be a real boring band.&nbsp; But I was wrong.&nbsp; Most of their songs were a lot heavier I thought.&nbsp; So then the Moshpits started forming more than they had been for Dropbox.&nbsp; Earshot was the next band I saw.&nbsp; The only good songs they had were "Wait" and "Get Away" that they played, and those were the last two.&nbsp; So Earshot wasn't as good as I thought they might have been.&nbsp; A lot of people didn't leave their spots to go see the local bands because Dope was on next.&nbsp; The crowd went absolutely crazy for them.&nbsp; I was getting slammed into people all over.&nbsp; I could barely breathe.&nbsp; But this one guy about 15 or 16 maybe, helped me and Cassie get out.&nbsp; It was kind of awkward...&nbsp;&nbsp;Cassie got out almost right away, but I was in the crowd for about 2 minutes longer because she could body surf out,&nbsp;and once she was out, the crowd got worse&nbsp;and the person who lifted her out, couldn't move to lift me out either.&nbsp; But once they were done, Drowning Pool went on stage.&nbsp; They were frickin' awesome.&nbsp; They had a great starter, "Sinner."&nbsp;&nbsp;They played all of the good songs that they had too.&nbsp; Then Damageplan went on.&nbsp; I didn't go watch them that much because&nbsp;I didn't&nbsp;like&nbsp;many of their songs.&nbsp; They had a couple of good ones&nbsp;like "Pride," "Breathing&nbsp;New Life" and "Fuck You" I think it's&nbsp;called.&nbsp; They&nbsp;also played "Walk"&nbsp;from Pantera becuz they have two members from Pantera in their band.&nbsp; The last&nbsp;band that went on was Saliva.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were my favorite&nbsp;live.&nbsp; Then Drowning Pool.&nbsp; They started with "Raise Up" and came back with&nbsp;"Always" as their&nbsp;encore.&nbsp; Saliva was just so awesome.&nbsp; I'd pay 27 bucks to see them&nbsp;by themselves.&nbsp; I lost my voice probably during Drowning Pool and even more during Saliva.&nbsp; It was so hard to talk and hear other people.&nbsp; There was a bunch more stuff that happened, but it would take forever to type it all.

      Well, its been about 5 or 6 days or something like that since I last posted.  It's Monday night so I have marching band tonight at 6:30-8:45.  Yesterday we had a parade so I was marching in that.  I couldn't keep the right foot going.  So when I was concentrating on the feet, I forgot the song.  So it kinda sucked and I probably looked like a dipshit.  But my favorite radio station is having something they call a band camp.  I really wanna go to that.  It's going to have 13 bands, 2 stages, 26 bucks, which is 2 bucks a band.  They're going to have Drowning Pool, Damageplan, Skillet, Flaw, DropBox, Dope, and some other bands there.  They have times when you can call in, and if you're the 9th caller, you get t-shirts and hats and other cool crap and 2 tickets to Band Camp.  So far I've called and been caller 5 and then it's also been busy.  So lots of people wanna go..  Jenny is thinking about taking me, but she's not positive.  She'll take me for sure if I win tickets, but not sure about buying them.  If I got to go, it would be really awesome.  On Friday at the fireworks I went to, they had some music in the background.  And after the guy said the finale was going to be next, Bodies by Drowning Pool (who are going to be at Band Camp) came on and right when they started shouting FLOOOOOOOOR in the song, the finale started.  I kept telling Jenny it was a sign.  So I think I might have a chance at going, hopefully.  MJ

       Man. I'm soo tired right now. Blah blah blah. I joined   urlLink  www.hi5.com    and recently I've been filling in the journals on there. But lately I can't even post because of some error or what not. So I'm just going to copy what I wrote there and paste it in here....   well hey.  it's sunday night, 11:00 p.m. on the dot. i tried making an entry this morning at 1 or something, but each time i tried posting, it would redirect me to the login page and i lost my entry.  but i figured that would happen so i got it copied and i'll paste it at the end of this entry if this gets posted.  maybe you can only have 1 post a day or something?  so today i listened to rockline and i went to church right after hearing "Survival of the Sickest" (saliva), which put that song in my head.  Basically the whole time i wasn't paying attention, which i never do much anyways, i was just singing that song in my head cuz i know every word..  then i came home and nobody was here.  i knew my dad was gonna be helping my sister move, but i didn't know my mom was gonna be mowing my g-pa's lawn.  there were 3 messages 1: lisa (middle sister who i look most like) she wanted to know if anybody was gonna be home to see if she should come home from madison.  2: jenny-wanted to know about something or other 3: this one lady that my mom doesn't like anymore.   so i called lisa and jenny back, then i went online for a little bit.  then i played sims for about 30 minutes and then lisa came home.  we called jenny and went to the gas station and the carwash.  I was gonna help my dad and jenny move, but they both get cranky after awhile and it was really warm out too.  so i decided to bail.  me and lisa watched "Don Juan De Marco" that we borrowed from jenny.  this was the first time i actually saw the whole thing.  its a pretty good movie.  Then we both took naps.  i ended up sleeping longer just becuz i didn't wanna move and she got a phone call.  Lacuna Coil just came on the radio with "Swamped."  lisa's starting to like them.  it really pisses me off after i type a big journal thing and i accidentally close out the window.. grr.  hasn't happened to me yet tonight, and i hope it doesn't.  there's this new show on abc called "The Days."  I've been watching it lately.  Call me weird, but the guy on there is kinda cute.  The song of today is gonna be whatever song that comes on the radio that i like best.. maybe..  after this i'm probably gonna play the sims while music vids download.  Well, it's still commercial on the radio so I've decided to just put the lyrics for the first few tracks on the new Drowning Pool cd on there.  But I left Step Up out of there..  still a good song though.  Oh, commercial break over, but it's Seether & Amy Lee-Broken.  They completely overplay this song and ruined it.  It was ruined once amy lee started singing in it though.  Even though that was supposed to be the original but they never got around recording it until the PUNISHER album came along.  The one with just seether is the best version.  so i guess i'm gonna play the sims now after i check my group things to see any new messages anybody left if they left any. "Think"And just before you fade out to I will hold a place for you Do you remember when we used to Do you remember when you used to Do you remember life Well, as you're led out to the slaughter You ought to Think about your life you wouldn't give it up Before you're led off to the slaughter You ought to And just as soon as you will find That all of this became your life Do you remember when we used to Do you remember when you used to Do you remember life Before you're led off to the slaughter You ought to And just as soon as all of this so All of this so pure Do you ever stop Fucking think"Numb"Numb To the man looking back at me Said why don't you go away We've all heard your misery You've been bleeding it for days end And it's plain when I look into your eyes I see All you want is everybody's sympathy So why don't you take all of this and go away So why do you always look to me this way When it seems like tomorrow might not come And it seems like the sorrow has left you numb And to the world I see Said we've sat and watched you shine Pack up all your guilt and please Leave it all behind And it's plain when I look into your eyes I see This could be the way you want your life to be Numb Now your gonna bleed So why don't you just tell me"This Life"And when it's cold out I will wait for her And I will roam out To the edges of the earth And when it feels just like the rain Has soaked through my bones None of this will matter None of this will save you from yourself This life It's bringing on the death of me Swear that I can barely see That I'm the one to blame This life I swear to God it's killin' me Seems some times I can't believe That I'm the one to blame And when it's cold out In the sleet and snow I will hold out 'Till the answers all unfold And when it feels just like the rain You will see through it all None of this will matter 'Cause none of this will save you from yourself None of this will matter None of this will save your from yourself"Nothingness"And this blood on my hands Now it won't go away I've been out on this road for days And the fear on the wall Watch it slowly cascade As the door holds the wolves at bay The emptiness is building from The nothingness that we've all become The emptiness is building from The nothingness that we've all become And this road that I've chose Seems it's taken its' toll Leading far far away from the soul And the fear on the wall Watch it slowly cascade As the door holds the wolves at bay The emptiness is building from The nothingness that we've all become The emptiness is building from The nothingness that we've all become This thing I've become seems its' taken control Of my mind and my body my will and my soul Driving further and further away from my self Until there's none of me left I've become something else The emptiness is building from The nothingness that we've all become
