       Warning: Please do not be alarmed by the following warcry.     EAARRRRGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH~~~~!!!!!! WWWWAAAAHHRRRRRRRRRGHHHHHH~~!!     &nbsp;  there... better..   as you can probably tell by now, i do not start with such titles and lines at the start of a normal blog. i will most probably talk about heavier stuff as its the night and i am in a totally horrible mood. if you do not like vulgar saysings.. im sorry i will probably let loose alot within this single blog. if you do not like heavier topics too, i advise u to skip it&nbsp;or look away.. that saying i do not care if you like wat you read, its you choice to be a responsible reader yourself (e.g dun go to porn sites if you dislike porn, sorry this is the best and easiest example i can think of now.)   yes i am pissed off.&nbsp;  ROYALLY   pissed off. diss me now and i swear i will most probably break your nose at least.&nbsp;Or hunt you down and&nbsp;torture you.&nbsp;this is seriously not the time to mess with me, espcially im swearing at cursing at EVERY single thing right now.. from the day's happenings to my computer...   DIE YOU GOD DAMNED S.O.B TROJANS... I WILL SEARCH YOU OUT AND ERASE YOU LIKE THE INSIGNIFICANT DATA YOU ARE.. DATA AS COURRPTED TO THE CORE LIKE YOU DESERVES TO BE BURNED BY SOME CYBER FORMATTING WAVE AND ROT IN DIGITAL HELL.. IF I COULD ENTER MY COMPUTER I WOULD GO IN THERE RIGHT NOW AND DEREZ YOUR SORRY EXTENTIONS.&nbsp; MARK MY WORDS. &nbsp;(wat it means is simply burn by some flames of judgement and rot in hell.. if i could personally attack you now i would kill your sorry asses.. word for word, yep.)   yea im sad too. very very sad. but.. of course my day had some great happenings.. those not as great eventually took its toll on me.. better count my blessings later.   good stuff first then. i will also be teaching how to do some NORMAL maintainence on people's computer.. since you ppl really dunno wat u are getting into.. and all&nbsp;u ppl can do is complain complain AND complain that your com is spoilt when u urself dunno how to care for it. (it gets &nbsp;very  annoying at times.) i used my com for nearly 5 years and it is coming along fine.. i really dun understand. (the only times it is spoilt is when OTHER people use it, very nice huh.)   so thank me and hail me as watever you want.   ok on&nbsp;to the&nbsp;serious part. happy stuff first... lets see now.. my good friend since p5 came to stay over last nite.. yep.. we played kof till like the wee hours of the morning.. it was damn fun man.. hahaha.. (Cheers yang feng =P) and of course.. today i visited city harvest church.. its a very nice place.. pretty cool.. and their service is more like a concert or something.. (no offense you guys) which is actually pretty cool.. no wonder it attracts younger ppl =P i think thats about it.. (pretty sad huh?)   now to computers... please... make your life better.. uninstall kazaa.. that piece of shit deserves digital hell, honest. stop surfing funny sites and have quick reflexes.. close pop up windows  FAST .. i have 2 precious websites for you still-ignorant-of-cyber-danger people.. it contains general fixes.   DISCLAIMER: I will  not  be responsible if anything bad happens to your computer by running such software. i personally used it and it worked fine for me. I am assuming you have at least some  common  sense and basic clicking knowledge before knowing what should be deleted and wat not by now. I also do not earn any royalties from 'promoting' these websites and their respective handwritten programs.. It is to merely help you combat cyber-dangers of the present and to help save your poor computers.   first:  urlLink http://www.merijn.org/index.html   ok... who knows what is&nbsp;'broswer hijack'?    .....    no one?  tch.. fine.. well.. if you suddenly find your homepage some porn page, some search engine.. or something that is NOT your normal or set homepage.. then congrats, you been -insert above term + -ed to it- also if you find weird and funny bars popping below your address bar (the place where you enter your URLs to go around the net) then the same applies.   go there.. and get the app(lication) called&nbsp;   hijack this!  , &nbsp; then &nbsp;jus run the app and then&nbsp;the 'scan' option..&nbsp;jus choose to remove everything unless you have the time to go through like 100+&nbsp;results or if you do not know wat the results mean.. most probably u jus need to redo some settings and if you dunno wat it means, usually you wont make customizations that would be affected by destroying every single&nbsp;search result.. download the other apps if you want and if&nbsp;u know how to use them, fine with me too. (if you do not, do some self-directed learning please.. i am not gonna babysit you all the time.)   second:  urlLink www.lavasoftusa.com   know wat a pop up is? its when those irritating small windows keep jumping up when u are surfing normally.. usually pop ups like casinos and porn and what not.. or some free thing.. (which is not free at all!)   ok.. this contains a nice free (and not free) program called ad-ware.. jus go here and download the free one.. you can look through the options if you want too, but directly selecting&nbsp;scan directly&nbsp;is fine too.. once u have all the search results..&nbsp;right-click and select 'select all results' and jus promptly delete them off.&nbsp;this will remove alot of spyware from your com which is a bad bad thing.. jus trust me on this.. you wouldn't want this on your computer.   still having browser hijacks and pop ups? well these programs target general ones.. if you still have such problems.. i really dunno wat porn u ppl surf -.- u could try other spyware destroyers or manually hunt them down (like me). Alternatively.. look down somemore :)  lastly:  urlLink www.hardwarezone.com   select the singapore portal when u go here.. (its at the top left) and go to the forums.. read around and if you still have any queries.. jus post and ask NICELY.. most likely some kind soul will help you.. please be nice even if you have a bad mood.. i cant stress this enough as alot of ppl hate disrespectful ppl.. usually there is some fix for some problem in some place at such a forum.   there.. now to the not-so-nice part of my day.. i wont blabber too much.. as i do not really go into detail with my stuff.. basically.. yinlun sure pissed me off today by coming to my place.. (and doing something real bad) it is simply, im so f***ing tired.. and he still disturbs me, very rudely&nbsp;i must add, and all sorts. service at church..&nbsp;i honestly dislike service, reasons.. please do  not  ask. i wont tell you and its really personal so dun waste your time. i appreciate it alot, thank you. and something else happened between me and another... 'person'. really saddened me alot to hear such things..   anyway... im really extremely tired these days.. so tired.. but im not tired now.. got alot of stuff to play and whack.. destress lol. so when i fell asleep and yinlun came to disturb (yes really disturb me, i dont often use this word so its pretty serious) me.. it really irritated me alot. also.. when i returned home and used my com. .(jus started using) alot more of the stupid trojans and spyware came up.. i really have NO IDEA WAT THE HELL HE SURFS, every SINGLE time he uses my com many problems surface.. my sister is also another 'virus', i swear she is one&nbsp;chunk of corrupted data! argh~ someone save my soul!!!   the final straw was about 11pm when i was on the phone with someone, YES IT IS A FEMALE SO STOP ASKING. she really disappointed me alot.. but at least she tries her best to make up for it, so i appluad her for being very sincere to me. (i not arrowing you and i not angry at you so please do not worry k? =P)   really.. alot of ppl do not know wat they can do and how much they can affect ppl's lives.. so next time.. jus try to make the world a better place ok? at least  she  knows and she is trying to be nice to ppl, poor abused ppl like me, and so i am very happy with her and also try not to put her in a difficult position, i jus accepted her offer gratefully and graciously. of course ill be more than happy&nbsp;with the new arrangement too ^^ i prefer it to the old arrangement actually. (jus telling u lah)   i think it should suffice for today.. i want to go play le.. i want to whack and kill ppl.. =X let all the steam out.. also got an important phonecall at 6-7+ in the morning 2moro.. i want to make sure i pick it up ^^ so i gonna sign sign off now!   P.S : Did you know i only have one pathetic packet of milo to accompany me now?&nbsp; I miss my tau hua =X~  P.P.S : I'm also feeling very depressed and lonely right now? I also do not feel like doing my project 2moro...   P.P.P.S : i added a ex-classmate's blog to the blog area.. make sure u check it out if you have time too ok? =P   R.P.S : I also cleaned my room today, wow ;)    That's a  major  achivement.

      first things first. so much can happen in a short span of 36 hours..    well.. surprisingly, much has happened in (technically) nearly 2 days.. this blog is more or less for some very interesting things i saw (and heard) last night too. and then, wat happened for today.. hold on, ill list it in order.  (starting from last night)    (1) Shu ting PS my bio 'save-your-grade' class (2) saw 2 very interesting couples. (3) heard a kid being whacked (very badly) on my way home. (these are more thought evoking) (4) did my mission statement this afternoon (5) first time tutoring someone.. sorta. (6) bought some games, yay. (7) dexter came over, talked cock, taught him html crap, and eating geylang tau hua together. (8) got very pissed off at home. (9) rest are secrets, so go away. (10) some interesting stuff i did to TRY make this blog more.. interesting.. (11x) the afterthoughts and ACTUAL blog.    thats about it. i suppose. *glances* yep, thats it i think.    oh and prepare yourself, this blog is gonna be  DAMN  long.. (thats the reason why i numbered them, makes your life easier or u can skip to stuff that interests you more.) so grab some snacks and maybe a drink... visit the loo if you have to.  for most of the numbered sections.. they are more or less jus my recap of the day. if you wanna skip it, jus hit ctrl+f and type in "(11x)" without the quotes ("  "). That's more of the main body with my feelings, thoughts and all the nice sentimental stuff. (if you are actually into it that is.)    with that aside... *cracks knuckles* here we go!    (1) Shuting called after i came back from school.. wanted to talk on phone with someone then she ask i free anot, ever being oh-so-nice i told her im free. (when im actually not that free, supposed to do project). fast forward abit.. when i walking to compass point.. then i msg her telling her i coming.. that was when she reply "i half asleep, forgot to tell u, sorry, test postpone to friday." yeah i was having the -.- face. then she said treat ice cream or something.. i was too lazy to be bother with ice cream by then.. since i was at CP, i was tasked with 2 errands, top up my mom's ezlink and pay bills... the SAM didnt like my mom's OCBC card.. after i reported to her, she figured its the bank, SAMs like POSB... weird. aint they all NETS? (wah so many terms, fun sia ^^)  and yes, i forgot that CP had an M1 shop.. i know, its dumb.    (2) on my way back.. i saw 2 very interesting couples. One, was a couple.. with the gal having her arm linked with her other half. spouses they are. its very obvious. Cause they are 70-80 years old (gotcha there didnt i? and yes my eyes were wide open, believe me.) and they were still chatting nicely, having a nice slow stroll at like 9pm? and look blissful. i stared at them cause i was very curious.. afterthoughts in (11x) so please bear with me. (get envious anyone? =P) The other couple was a guy on the bike with the gal sitting on the frame of the bike.. an MTB. Don't worry, these pair were in their mid 20s. (you sickening idiots want a poor 80 year old chap to have a heart attack is it!?)    (3) On the kid being whacked.. its when i was walking past Seng Kang Primary, i heard it from some unit above me.. it sounded horrible.. the cane brings back memories of mine u know.. and some dumb kid flashed a laser at me.. u dun wanna know wat i did after that.. it isn't polite, trust me. =P     (4) mission statement.. it is some dumb thing i must do cause of a nice little core subject at temasek poly called Applied Principles of Effective Learning - APEL for short. its jus a nice little draft of wats impt to me, simply.    (5) after that... dear jia qi PS me.. (gotta get used to it) and i waited in vain for her.. rebecaa was visibly upset too.. AND it had to rain the moment i got outta poly... got TOTALLY drenched. great. i had to rush to Ang Mo Kio to tutor someone after that too.. (details are confidential so dont ask, yan ling knows the details cause....) after that, i had dinner with yan ling.. yay! =D    (6) of course.. since i was in amk.. i stumbled over to central to buy some games.. games includes armored core 3 for PS2, and the sims: hot date for my sis.. im such a good brother. i love my sis too. (xiao mei i love you too so dun jealous k? =P)    (7) on bus 86, and somewhere near yio chu kang station, i recieved a call from dexter, thats nice. wanted to come over to ask me some html stuff.. his coursework, of course i welcomed him over and he stayed awhiel.. taught him, ate tau hua that my dad bought, and of course screw around a little.    (8) as for getting pissed off.. i supposed its an accumulation of the day ba. sorry AGAIN to 'you-know-who-you-are' for getting angry at you. My most sincere apologies.    (9) self-explainatory. can only tell CERTAIN ppl these things =P (so go away lol)  (10) as for stuff i did to this blog... added a description.. blah.. added some links to my friends' blogs... blah.. and if you have not noticed, end of every blog, i throw in a R.P.S, stands for Random Please See.. jus a random note of some unusual knowledge or jus something funny or i feel like saying.. if u want to share something do it through the comments (which reminds me, i have my first comment done by sok feng =D) or jus throw me a line, contacts to the right. if u want my handphone number... mail or msg me and ill see if i can give it to you or not, alternatively, ask around. (or ask me, in the end. =X) im gonna see wat else i can do with this. or one fine day i jus do alot of html editing.    and finally....     drumroll............     (11x) the MAIN part of the blog... well... i dunno how long it will be actually.. depends how much i can think of actually..   well.. maybe ill jus crap around about the stuff i saw.. its more fun anyway. Seriously, how many people do you see, after marriage, still hug each other in their sleep? Link hands where ever they go? give a quick peck to the cheek on occasions in public? or have fun all the time, everywhere? maybe not even feeding each other, having strolls, doing simple things like providing jackets tissues umbrellas or opening doors for her. i find it quite saddening you know.. you are supposed to love him/her so much yet the relationship 'colds' towards the end. That is actually alot of reason why many people is afraid of jumping into one.  but then again, look at the elderly couple.. they happily express their feelings for each other. As for the biking couple.. would u actually still do such things AFTER courtship? or AFTER marriage? hardly. that couple was married, i saw the rings :)  people often do now know the power of words.. if they really love someone and say it out to themselves facing a mirror, and say "i will make sure i love -insert lover's name here- forever and make sure that we will be a loving couple till the end." chances are, it will happen ^^ cause you told yourself, and u will   work   towards  MAKING  it happen. fate can bring a couple together.. but they must forge their own destiny.. (u are most welcomed to comment on this part)  Express yourself openly if you have to. If you dislike say.. fish, express it openly or people might get the wrong idea. Same with feelings. expressing feelings will also, in a sense, let you face the music.. u already said/expressed it out, u cannot run away from this fact. Once you embrace it, that fact will become a part of you and grow with u.. (i dislike coffee.. and it grew to me disliking tea too lol)    PERSONALLY , i do not believe in sitting there and expecting things to happen.. (part of the reason why im a free thinker.) i go out and make sure it happens, or i dun expect it at all. And as for saying that scentence to myself, i already did it :) and it is already affecting the way some things are done. =P *ahem! DAR~ling! ahem!*  I sound like either some guy that fell outta love or some love/marriage counselor. =X  Here is a extract of something im listening to now.     when i fall in love, im falling in love..     nothing in this world can take you away~     when i fall in love, im falling in love~     baby i want u to know i am always here to stay~           cause when i hold u close     to me i cant let you go     i want to know you well     i want to let you know     cause when i hear your voice     i know i wont let go     cause my love for you is real     so baby please dont go.         this is a song i recently accuired =P nice lyrics huh? it really got me thinking about the above.. pretty interesting you know ^^ pretty meaningful if u link it to the couples above.. maybe u might wanna think abt such incidents that relates to you.. *i am linking this song to someone/thing/watever now ^^* reminds me of something. like some people's parents i know of that are so loving.. heh.. even if they are from different worlds.. too bad my parents aint loving.  I think this blog is long enough.. hope you didnt fall asleep halfway reading it all =P   if you want to read more wait for the next blog =P          P.S : Told you this blog was long.. believe me now? =P  P.P.S : This blog took me quite some time to write.. i had to save it many times.. i also written it in many locations.. like the com labs in TP, or at home.. (in between breaks)  R.P.S : Did you know writing blogs help relieve some stress? I love writing too also. (That's why i write it =P)

      yes its official. Many of my brain cells fought valiantly against the evils of Computer Maths 1 today at High Noon and died honourably like the heros they are.  Sigh... lets have a simple breakdown of my day..  First up was waking up to a msg from someone telling me her exam results.. did quite well.. so obviously i smsed back and congratulated her.. and promptly fell back to sleep.. and then went to 'overdrive' =X  Skip breakfast and smsing nadiah to comfirm wat time to meet to revise.. i had a headache already.. (its getting pretty common it seems =X) went to play PS2.. forgot to heal my mothership and it got pummeled by a  SUPER  boss.. one hour of work and quick save+load gone.. (the most headache part was trying to attain near death status on one of my units for secrets.. many brain cells and about half an hour of trying later, i did it)  i screamed "BIG F***" like some bloody sissy (more wailings followed)..  and of course promptly dressed up and got out of the damned house.. (Damn you Dark Emperor!!!)  Revise and all that.. also had a surprised phonecall.. travelling made my headache worse.. =X not having lunch and teaching all the way to 3pm also did not help it.. man i feel horrible by then.. had to rush to com lab to find my exam sitting number... crap man..  with computer maths attacking me like a bunch of starved chicken.. many brain cells did not survive the onslaught.. May those who have forfeited their lives rest in eternal peace for they have fought with honour for a better future. May their wills find sanctuary.  Wats next... oh ya.. then after that to the mensa for some bubor hitam!!   but   no more le... =XXX ub3r crap.. then walked the gate out.. and i thought i treated myself to some chocolate chip ice cream.. thats when i found this uncle who sells the ice cream for 80 cents, not $1 and gives either 4 pieces of waffer biscuts or HIGHER quality bread instead of the cheap crap.. (sunshine bread i believe). Oh ya.. then walked passed near a coffeeshop with GREAT SMELLING  char kuey teoh ... (you can bet im having  that  for lunch 2moro)  then jus walked aimlessly.. bought newspaper from a roadsite ah pek.. sat at a place nice and quiet to read.. eating ice cream.. still waiting for yang feng's call.. also recieved a funny sms from dexter =P  by arnd 6.. i decided to leave.. and called someone to chat.. appears she jus woke up too.. nice timing =P chased after a packed bus.. and well.. im here now, writing thise blog =X  This blog is also a dedication to Poh Yang Feng, my friend since primary 5 who did alot of shit with me back then.

      i have a confession to make.. i was having a love making session the entire morning on this sunday morning with my beloved 'wife'.. i have my exam week this coming week and im  supposed  to study.. and i forgot to attend a party this morning too.. man..  ok before you start freaking out with things like "BENG!?", "LOVE MAKING!?" or "NOOOO~~~~!!!!" (or "wats new" in some of your cases) i have to direct you to a link first..   urlLink http://www.popcap.com/index.php   then.. scroll down abit.. click on the game '  Insaniquarium  ' and wait for it to load.. (click yes when they ask you to install something)  check out the descriptions.. this game is a tad lame.. but damn fun.. (especially in the later stages)  " feed your fish and watch them grow, then click on the shit they drop to fund yourself.. " -description of the game by reviewer Beng.  this is a two way game.. feed your fish with love, and with the love they recieve, they will love you back, in terms of 'shit' (that is actually money) and since you love your fish so much.. u have to fight back the aliens that invade your tank.. with love again.. (the love of slamming your left mouse button at an alarming speed that would make bishi bashi champs proud)  this is what i meant by a 'love making session'.  wat did you think it was? sex? drugs? or an orgy?   you ppl think too far..     back to the preview..  the game starts simple.. u are provided with 2 fishes.. (guppies actually.) then u jus feed them.. left click in the aquarium to drop a piece of.. shit-like fish food and your guppies will eat it up  IF  they are hungry.. feed them more and they will grow to medium size.. and start dropping money.. the fishes can grow up to 3 times..  later stages have u fighting all sorts of alien invasions who want nothing more than to gobble, missile, gobble again or jus plain irritate your fish to death.. from aliens that look like robots that fires homing missiles at your fishes.. to aliens that want nothing more than to eat ALL your fishes up.. you can actually combat them by clicking on them (to death, im not kidding). clicking on them has the effect of firing lasers at them.. (or in one special case, feed it with fish food). i wont spoil too much of the game to you.. play on to find out.  the main objective of the game is to save up money to buy 'egg pieces' that appear in your purchase menu.. once you buy 3 pieces, the current level ends and the egg will hatch into a 'pet'. these pets will help you in a variety of ways.. from a reproducing guppy mother, to an undead fish, to combat underwater creatures, and money catchers.. and a few more. to find out what the rest is, jus play :) its fun really!  there are many upgrades too. you start off only being able to have only one food piece onscreen at anytime, you can upgrade to a maximum of 9 food pieces onscreen and the food itself can be upgraded twice, to provide more 'nutrients' with each upgrade..  for me, the fun part comes when the later parts has the more fun pets and the more interesting fishes.. fishes like the flowerhorn "luo han" fish, to potions that transform fishes to golden fishes, to star-catching 'octopuses'.. its very interesting to populate your tank with such fishes and watch the constant barrage of money.. i had a 'star shower', a 'the sky is dropping money (at an insane rate)' and of course 'diamond mania! (diamonds were popping up and falling down)' i was too busy clicking like a madman trying to pick up ALL cash.. trust me on one thing, after you finish the game, you will wonder how many times you clicked the damned mouse.. the game can get VERY hectic and insane later.. its very  very   very   very     very         fun.. i highly recommend it... i killed like 3 hours on the game... before i went on with my life.. (eating lunch and writing this blog) =X yes it is that addictive too.. (kudos to eunice for intro-ing the game to me)       me and my sis was shouting many things the whole afternoon, like "tua eng kong", "stop farting lah you &#$^!", "die you stupid alien", "AAAIIEEEE! my fishes!!!", "feed feed! money there!!!" and many more..  try the damn game.. my declaration of love comes up next..   LOVE MAKING IS GREAT! I  LOVE   IT!!     I LIKE MAKING LOVE!!  love making damn song ;) i cant get this morning out of my mind *winks* =D ( you get my meaning dont you? =P)  one more thing i really gotta splash is Magister Negi Magi (Mo Fa Lao Shi) 6 is out, and the book is AWESOME! the fight scenes are damn tense and had a firm grip on my sights and attention non stop... damn nice sia =D but i went down yesterday and today to cp to find Get Backers 26 to no avail.. wasted 2 trips =X when is it gonna come out~~ *gripes*  i dun wanna talk too much.. or else alot of ppl will complain my blog is too damned long... =X also got a very big headache after making so much love this morning... so gonna sign sign off~!  P.S : I love my lao po(s)..  P.P.S : *turns back* watcha lookin at? i was refering to my fishes!!!  P.P.P.S : Ok i love you ppl too.. *winks* ;)  R.P.S : Did you notice that most of my blog titles were VERY suggestive? =P *take a close look*  Note: oh yea.. if any of you wants to post a comment, kindly leave your name or some detail of you.. some comments i can guess (as i asked them to take a look and they did leave a comment) but others.. like the recent one "you are gonna be named T.O.T - Takeshi of Temasek".. leave me totally clueless.. -.- and who ohhhhhs like that.. and is from TP.. hm... =X (whos Takeshi anyway, sorry i dun watch tv.. =X) Please keep the comments coming otherwise, i get entertained for at least 5 secs (average) per comment ;) I also truly appreciate and enjoy ANY feedback.
