      i'm confused.. at times i really wonder.. is it the way my mind switches.. or the people around me? maybe all of us.. haha.. it's hard to control.. but meanwhile.. it's still our choice.. afterall.. the life is ours.. we decide wad we want to do with it rite?..   today's truly amazing.. i found myself waking up 5 mins before my alarm.. 'wad great timing'.. i tot to myself.. but it seems to be happening for the past few days.. however, today's a little different.. i didnt feel a bit tired.. i felt full of life and energetic.. but lazy bones are like the spots on a leapord's skin..  dragging my legs to the toilet.. hmmm.. i felt really great today.. besides the time that i had to ask ppl to shut up.. i hate throwing my tantrum.. well.. it's truly hard to control.. but yah, its our choice.. there'll be times when i feel really guilty doing something becos someone did something to mi which i didnt like so i double the pain back which shldnt be the case cos always treat others how u wld like to be treated and place urself in someone elses' shoes.. well.. thats the way to be considerate.. i dun like to strain any friendships cos i feel that everyone of our frens are basically "god's gift".. why i had to put those inverted commas?.. cos i dun believe in god?.. yah.. and so.. now here i amat home.. writing a bloggy.. hoping i'll suddenly get motivated to study and wishing for a freaking miracle to pass mi by that there will be no oral this sat cos it seems like my nervous system will soon break down and get mi the stomach aches.. yah..  hahahx.. well.. come quickly.. go quickly ba.. last year here anywayzx.. i mean.. hopefully.. so.. mus really whack my way thru.. otherwise.. i confirm i sure regret which infact i already am cos i'm basically wasting my precious time here typing a blog for the fun of it?.. or maybe for pleasure?.. lolzx.. wad ever it is.. today's been really great.. always wishing tomolo's beta.. -peace out-

      This morning's weird.. I wake up to find myself not energised at all.. Life's tough.. O Levels' coming and i'm rushing.. sometimes.. we feel like giving up.. but we'll come to realise that that would be a stupid choice.. however.. it seems to me like i've been thinking that way all these while.. Each time i feel really drained, i'll feel like giving up.. but i know that i should get it done and over with.. afterall.. the world is round.. by giving up, i'm jus leaving the problem/s there and one day.. it'll come back again.. I don't wan to waste such time.. Well.. i guess i'll just finish this year nicely and quickly.. hopefully, i won't come back again.. haha.. It's hard sometimes when u know that everyone in the world is ur competitor.. frm the day i entered this world.. i've started competing with everyone else.. esp when you enter schools and the world market.. you compete with knowledge.. for money, for post.. for almost everything in the world.. I really wish i belonged to the cavemen times.. what would we need to compete for, besides food and water and maybe a wife?.. haha.. ok.. so.. we're still competing.. well.. i'm still figuring the meaning of my life.. it's complicating.. and at times.. really pathetic.. I don't even know what i want to be when i grow up.. i'm ambitionless.. i'm talentless and plain empty.. I'm really worried.. my studies suck.. and it seems like 'so will my future'..

(it happens).. then get his morning and evening walks.. eat great food.. wad more cld a dog like him ask for?.. haahahzx.. it certainly looks like he need a companion.. u know wad i mean.. so.. gtg..

      let mi see.. today was pretty gd.. though still a little upset over my pathetic results, leading to me going bonkers today. Anyways.. i think i was most bonkers suring my sss with Aliah.. lolzx.. dun really know his name but he's actually this sec 5 guy hu is a little bit on the cc type yah know?.. fat, so to speak.. Aliah and i were bored and we forced out our imagination and tot he was pretty cute.. we obeserved his every move and laugh each time we noticed something and acted it out.. lolzx.. it was truly amusing.. it was probably the most enjoyable sss i ever had.. so cool.. we said he was hot and cute and adorable and sweet, and all the gd stuff.. lolzx..  aliah noticed his chest and butt.. lolzx.. yah.. and we were laughin at that too.. really.. it was funny.. and totally lame.. cos obviously we were being really insane and crappy and all but certain things are hard to control rite?.. lolzx.. then when sss ended.. it started to rain and all.. did part of my colour scheme.. that sri didnt come today so we cont our art from where we stopped.. and wad i realised was that everyone was pretty much serious about completing their art.. including those hu usually sleeps or do their own work when she aint arnd.. except for bs.. he's still not being very serious.. lolzx..   hmmmm.. i sincerely hope i can fight thru this battle field and still stay alive and strong.. not easy though of cos.. aiming for visual comm.. i know i said this b4.. just repeating it.. hais.. cant seem to concentrate on my work.. i mus do it!!.. mi go bathe le.. then do my art.. jia you!!!!

      Hmmm ... This is on the agruement i and benji had the other day ....   So ... How do you define right from wrong ?? Moral from immoral ??  well ... We agreed on that there is a yardstick set by us humans and is agreed across the board ....   Butt.... Think of this ... What if the 'across the board' people are actually wrong ?? What if by murdering people, Raping gals, Committing crimes are the right way of living ??    So ...You see ... We are brainwash since young ... To Tell wat is right from wat is wrong .... With the yardstick set by the 'across the board' people .... lol .... So .... Imagine this .. Wat if the MAJORITY of people in the 'board' are all evil(Then again ... What is evil ??) ?? As in crime committer ... Etcs ... What will the world become !!??   So .. My point of this thrash writing is that ... There is different perspective point of view in everyday life ... Try looking at different views ... And even the ugliest scene .. There is beauty ....   Another point is that try to take life easy .. Dun take it too hard or too serious ... Well .. For me is that i'm taking it too easily ... lol ... But then .. It is good .... And bad .. But then .. How do we actually gauge it !? There is no answer ... lol .... So ... We go with the crowd ....

      Hmmmm...... What's the best thing about being a human ??    Some says its our brain some says its our ability to feel ... Emotion ....    Hmmm.... I'll discuss about our ability to feel ....    Its a paradox that our emotion is the best thing about being a human ... yet its sometimes the worse .... Our ability to feel .... Its priceless ... And only a few animals have the same ability .... Yet ... Our emotion is by far the most developed guaging it against the mammal list ...  Yet ... emotions ... At times blind us and makes us judgemental ... OR blind to the truth ... Well ... MOst cases happens when a subject is in love or hatred .... This two emotions ... Are pretty unique to us humans .... The ability to love is also paradoxical in nature .....     Hmmm .... Running out of lingga ... will be back to continue this essay ...

      Juz finish posting my agreement for evolution in Benjamin’s blog… Hmmm… I feel like doing another one… lol … so. This will be my first in my blog lol.    Ok… Its said that if alien life did exist… It will be in the form of bug-life… I know.. I know… Why Bugs ??? Judging from the pathetic existence of them on earth’s LAND… How can it be possible that bug will exist in as alien life !?!? Intriguing as it may sound… Bugs are the most intelligent life form on earth now… It maybe a paradox… But they are very versatile and can be found everywhere on earth… Even in volcanoes’ lava…  I remember reading somewhere on the net from a webbie that has Oxford University to verify it’s authentic…   So… The webbie contain the following…. They went to the deepest of the Atlantic Ocean to search for life form at the seabed… And to their greatest surprise… They found species that resemble woodlouse found normally on my earth’s surface… Except that this particular woodlouse is 6 foot long… And lives in colony… With a colony that has a pretty well developed infrastructure… Surprising… agree?? Scientist have a hypothesis that bugs on land cant grow bigger because of gravity confining them to their outer carapaces… It is believe that if there is no gravity… Bugs will be even bigger than humans !!!    How far do you agree ???

      Here's the lyrics to Zuo An By Andy Lau... A damn nice song.... Beautiful metaphor....       左岸   月光流过整条河  心有种温暖  你是否记得我  还在对岸痴心等候   放思念穿越过河  却无处停泊  我眺望你的笑  灯火都看穿泪闪烁   离也没有用　忘也没有用  我说爱你没人听得懂   想搭座桥　让你知道  这些日子我是怎么过   喊也没有用　慌也没有用  陌生城市　陌生人是我   一条界线　两边天空  我在黑夜　你在白昼

      w00t.... Something I wrote again... The so called grammar errors are there for the poetic effects... And the rhythm...  &nbsp;     The Beach    &nbsp;  The new crescent moon rise, painting the horizon crimson red The warm sea breeze caress my face, calming my confused soul The sullen palm trees swings to the calming breeze The random sea waves breaks on shore, eroding the pearl white sand  The silence emanated from this place, amplifying my loneliness The breaking waves, revealing a once broken heart The stars gather, as my love for you manifests The crimson sunset, marks the end of another day.  I stroll along the shores, feeling tired, Of being only a mere cypher in your heart….

      Hmmm.... Something I wrote again...        Surreal World (I)      Darkness falls, a cynic I am  Strolling back into a surreal world  A surreal world where all is perfect  A world where reciprocating love exists   A world where no weeds hinder the flowers growth  where no lonely messages drift in the sea  where no aimless logs flow in the lake  where no lone moon hangs in the starless sky   Dawn breaks, revealing a young sun  The crows caw, awakening me from the surreal world  To this world, This cold reality  A world where love is one sided   A world where flowers are overrun by weeds  where lonely messages drift in the boundless ocean  where aimless logs are wash into waterfalls by the current  where a lone moon has only her reflection in the lake as company   A world where emptiness fills my soul  A world where lonely souls walk the streets  A reality which has love and hate  A reality which is paradoxical   This reality where I am confined,  With only my surreal world as a gateway.....

        Something i wrote again....     Comment...          Misty Love   A veil of darkness covers the sky, hiding the crescent moon A tired lighthouse on the cliff, shining out to the vast sea A lone North Star on the starless sky, illuminating hope for the lost ships abound A veil of heavy fog settles, devouring the ships’ only hope  Snow falling, painting the sky white A willow by the lake, weeping silent tears A wolf in the white hills, howling out to his lost mates A lone lovesick soul, strolling down the empty banks  Fast changing temperament, creating a heavy fog around this lone soul Deafening silence emanating from the surrounding, amplifying my solitude A stone thrown into the lake, destroying the moon’s only company  Groping into this fog, searching for that Love But the misty outline is forever deluding my reach…

       T his will be the LAST secondary school 'First Day Of School'... Haha... Well, we started the day by some newspaper reading thing... Not bad.. To me at least i know more about the current affairs liao... (I dont really read newspaper or watch the News u see... =p) Whoo~ But i was just reading the Life! of The Straits Times! Haha... Read mainly on Barry Manilow... Cuz American Idol(AMI) mahx... Hehe... He appeared as a guest judge once on AMI3. Many say he looks like Clay Aiken(when he's old).. Haha... Maybe? Well, can't believe it! He's 50+(i tink?) now and still releasing album! In fact, he's working on another one now! Geez... Never heard of his songs before.. Will it be as nice as Clay's? Hmm...  Enough of Mr Manilow... We had a *REAL* boring talk by Mr Ee... Geez... Zip you mouth? -_-"  Why don't any English teachers correct him? Is it because of... Scared got sacked? Hehe... Anyway, we had a new teacher teaching SS... The name's Mr Fairizal. Pretty okay teacher, more or less friendly and spent the first lesson sharing his experience in his secondary school life with us. Not bad. Chinese teacher tot change to Mr Sun.. Turn out to be She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named again. How boring~~ Yawnx. Oh, we had our P.E teacher change to Miss Mayanti(spelling?). Oh man! I prefer Mr Shawn! Wat to do? School's the Boss... >.  After school had lunch with my friends and didn't play basketball(cuz dun hav).. So went home lorz... Haha... Not bad for the first day. Not as boring as i expect. But it's still.. Boring. =p  P.S: 4E Friends out there reading this, CHIOOONG your studies like mad goat raping innocent child now!(WeiRd? ^^") This's your last year! Make full use of it! ;)  P.S2: 4E Friends out there reading this, if you pass your 'O's with flying colours, why? It's because of my advice! Hehe... Just joking... ^^"  Today's quotes from Life!...    Barry Manilow(Clay's dad? Nono... ^^)   Quote: In Asia, casinos have typically been for gamblers, but in United States, the whole family goes to the casino for great food and entertainment. Quote 2: Casinos want winners, believe it or not. If you make the clients lose all their money, they'll never come back.

       T oday i had English lesson again but Mr Francis Teo came in to teach us instead. Jus stuff bout speech and so on. Luckily, he dismissed us early but we still hav SS afterwards. Had a short breakfast and after which, we went to SAC. Miss See kept saying stuff bout wat cheese, meat and watever... It was very boring and i kept yawning, hopeing she'll notice. Haha.. Jason, Hong Guan and Kheng Wei fell asleep until she woke em up wif tat loud voice over the mic. Lolx...  After the 'torturing' session, we(chunseng, ivan, yipeng, po tiong, junrong, jianqiang, zhanyuan, guowei, jianlong and me) went to play basketball at the court near the school's bus stop. I had great fun although my team lost by a close points of 19-21. Haiz.. Time really flies. It seemed like yesterday when i jus came back from school to start 'holiday-ing'.. But now.. HaiZ!! 4 more days left.. Oh ya, talking bout yesterday, ron and jianlong came 2 my house 2 play PC, PS2 and watch Naruto. Naruto is a really nice anime tat i'd introduce to anyone. Yesterday i watched World Idol too. Tat Kurt Nilsen won in de end! Oh man. I was supporting Kelly Clarkson and Will Young. But Kurt managed to get full points(10, except for own country 12) for almost ALL the countries! He got a total of 106 points with Kelly in the runnerup with 97 points. Geez.. He sang okay to me. But not *THAT* appealing. He dont even have the looks.. Haiz.. Spent my holiday soo fast. As usual. >_  P.S: Both quotes in this post r from Naruto and sorry, the first one is pretty long. But meaningful. ^^  P.S2: Soo many people have bloggies now... Jus look at de links there! WoW!    Naruto   Quote: Flesh wounds bleed, and they may seem painful. But as time goes by, the pain eventually disappears. And if you use medicine, it will heal even faster. But the tricky ones are the ones in your heart. Those are difficult to heal. A wound of the heart is different from a flesh wound. Unlike a flesh wound, there are no ointments to heal it, and there are times when they never heal. But there is one thing that can heal a wound of the heart. It's a troublesome medicine and you can only receive it from another person. The thing that can heal a wound of the heart is  Love . Quote 2: Love is the spirit of devoting yourself to someone important or close to you. It is expressed by caring for and protecting that person.

It's not necessary at all, why did we get elcord thingy anyway? We already learned how to do summary there! Had been doing nothing but summaries thingies de whole lesson. Haiz.. After which we had Miss See's Social Studies. She announced de teachers tat'll be teaching us(406, 409, 410). For us, we had Jeffrey Aw(Geez) and a new male teacher(forgotten his name). Haiz!!!  In the afternoon, we played basketball(Chun Seng, Ron, Zhan Yuan n me a team) vs de NPCC team.. Lolx.. I tink we won(didn't really count the points) in de end. After which, ron came to my house to play RO  again . Haiz.. Today she didn't turn up at school today.. >_  P.S: Thanks to Kheng, i borrowed from him Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix! Yay~ ^^ P.S 2: Damned, it's thick.   Quote: In the end, we will conserve only what we love, we will love only what we understand, we will understand only what we are taught.

       A rgh... Finally finished reading Harry Potter book 3... Spent the whole morning and finished more than half the book! Guess it's easier to understand when I've seen the movie. =)  The story is really marvelous! The pathetic movie is like a summary of the whole book! Missed out many events like Griffindor winning the Quidditch matches when Harry got the Firebolt OR how biased Severus Snape was OR the little history about the history of Moony(Lupin), Wormtail(Peter), Padfoot(Sirius) and Prongs(James) with Snape in their schooldays and many others! Geez... And just when is He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named gonna die? Haiz! I hope the Harry Potter movie 3 will release some extended versions in VCD/DVD. Hope the 4th movie(if there is one) will not take away such many details. Oh, heard from Kheng Wei it's gonna be three hours long! Hope so! ^^  Browse through this   urlLink website   on Harry Potter! It provides lots of imformation regarding many things such as the Characters, Spells, Creatures and so on. I dont think it's an official webbie though... but it's nice. Also, check out this   urlLink website  . Do be careful of *Spoilers* though. It contains all de mistakes in the Harry Potter 3 movie! Goofs! ^^ Haiz.. Still couldn't find anyone for the 4th and 5th books.. Geez. Oh btw, if anyone wishes his/her webbie to appear under my links, feel free to  urlLink email me . Gotta find something else to do now~ Signing off! ^^  P.S: The quotes posted today are all from Harry Potter books! ;)    Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban   Quote: There are all kinds of courage. It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much as to stand up to our friends. Quote 2: If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals. Quote 3: Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can't see where it keeps its brain.

       T hese few days were pretty boring. I had been playing computer games, surfing around, taking care of my yet-fully-recovered sis, slacking around, reading Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and watching TV programmes. There are many scenes and events in Harry Potter tat are not shown in de movie! It's really nice. And looks like Snape's character is slightly worse in de book! Very very nice..! Can any kind soul lend me de 4th and 5th books(Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix)? ^^  Also, i wont be updating this bloggy unless i've something to write(or type). Added 2 people to contribute(post) on my blog.. Fenix n Peabrain.. For fun lorx. ^^ Also, ive learnt more about html n stuff.. Credit to Kheng Wei's   urlLink webbie  , which provides a simple guide about html and java. He's still working on it though. Hope ya complete it soon! In addition, i added polls and counter at the sidebar! Cool huh? Well anyway, i found this interesting story on de web recently... It's very meaningful and interesting. There you go~~~    A King in Africa who had a close friend that he grew up with. The friend had a habit of after looking at every situation that ever occurred in his life(positive or negative), he'll remark, "This is good,   Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala   knows best."  One day the King and his friend were out on a hunting expedition. The friend loaded and prepared the guns for the King. The friend had apparently done something wrong in preparing one of the guns, for after taking the gun from his friend, the King fired it and his thumb was blown off. Examining the situation  the friend remarked as usual, "This is good!   Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala   knows best."  To which the King replied, "No, this is NOT good!" and ordered his soldiers to put his friend into jail in fury. About a year later, the King was hunting in an area that he should have known to stay clear of. Unexpectedly, the cannibals captured the King and took him to their village. They tied his hands, stacked some wood, set up a stake and bound him to the stake. As they came near to set fire to the wood, they noticed that the King was missing a thumb.   Being superstitious, they never ate anyone who was less than whole. So after untying the King, they chased him out of the village. When the King reached his palace, he was reminded of the event that had taken his thumb and felt remorse for his treatment of his friend. He went immediately to the jail to speak with his friend.  "You were right," the King said, "it was good that my thumb was blown off." And he proceeded to tell the friend all that had just happened. "I am very sorry for sending you to jail for so long. It was bad for me to do this."  "No," his friend replied, "This is good,   Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala   knows  best."  "What do you mean, 'This is good'!? How could it be good that I sent my friend to jail for a year?"   The King's friend replied: "Remember that   Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala   knows best and if I had NOT been in jail, I would have been with you."       Surah Al Hajj  22:76  He knows what is before them And what is behind them: And to Allah go back All questions (for decision) Do not judge things or events by its immediate outcome!    Comments anyone? Interesting huh? Oh, the 4th paragraph was a bit lame though. And i duno who on earth's   Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala  .. Hehex.. Guess it must be some God or something of some religion. Cuz got 'Allah'.. Ritex? Then again, I don't really believe God exists... To me, believing God is like believing luck, its a phenomenon. Then again, if You really exist, don't be offended in anyway. Just in case, lolx. ^^"  Finally,   One   last day left. Patience...    The King with a Missing Thumb ^^   Quote: When the solution is simple, God is answering. Quote 2: Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.

       T eaching Jason and Prislin bout putting pictures/photos in their blogs in the morning. It was a little troublesome but i had nothing better to do anyway. ^^  Well, there seems to be a problem about the pictures appearing which i am unable to help.. Sorry~ ^^"  Soon after, i had relatives visiting my sister today in the late morning. We hardly contact any of our relatives beside occasions like Chinese New Year and so on. Thus, I don't really know em much. And bout my sis.. She is okay now. Just tat she cannot move around too much on her own but can still walk like any normal person. After the operation, she had a height increment of 2 cm from 167 to 169! She thinks she's taller than me now... Yup, you heard me,  she thinks . Hee.. =p  Well anyway, they left at about in the afternoon at 1 to 2 pm.  During evening time, my brother came back home with his ex-girlfrend and other 2 female ex-classmates. Haiz! I dont really like visitors(besides my frends.. keke..) as i had to play host and serve drinks and so on. Meanwhile all these time, i started playing my PS2(Dragonball - Budokai 2). It was very hard and then i turned to - the cheat codes! I managed to find plenty of em on the internet. Hee.. Cheater Me(read Quote 2). Haiz, some games really hard to complete xia. Dont have so much time too. Hehex.. ChEaT CoDeS RuLeZ!  4 more days.. Haiz.. Seemed like forever. >_  P.S. I came across this interesting saying.. Or theory they called.  It's " First Praise Then Criticise ." Interesting and very true isn't it?    Dragonball Z - Budokai 2   Quote: Though it be honest, it is never good to bring bad news. Quote 2: It pays to be honest, but it's a slow pay.

       K elvin Lau and Grace's wedding today! Whoohoo~ Went to have lunch at Mac(bedok) with Jason, Kheng Wei and Zhong Xuan near the interchange. Then waited for Hong Guan and we went to the church. We were pretty early(and we had to) and saw the vice principal and YiRen walking in too. We were given orders by Mr Lau to reserve 3 parking slots for his parents, his cousin and the bride's cars. It was really hot there and we had most of our jobs done anyway. Well, im skippin all these boring parts now... Jus tat many people arrived - principal, vice-principal, some teachers and 406 students, ex-east viewians, relatives and friends of the groom and bride's.. etc. After Mr and Mrs Lau exchanged the rings and made the vows, i managed to capture the video clip of Mr Lau kissing the bride! Had many more clips too. If anyone wants, feel free to contact me.. I'll send em to you! It was really a sweet and nice event there! Haiz, hope she's there too! The wedding ended with phototaking sessions and the buffet thingy. Perfect couple - both teachers!!! =)  After which, JunRong went to my house(after a long waiting for bus and long bus 17 ride) and watched Naruto anime and played games on the PS2. Was really tired now but still uploading those photos to my   urlLink webshots  . Oh btw, my 2nd webshot account has been created. Feel free to come and look at it! So now i have 2 accounts, one with the user leonwyx and the other with wyxleon. I tink some idiot(who's trying to be funny but not) used the username leonwyx2. Well then... Nvm. 5 more days now... Well anyway.. All de best to your wedding, Mr Lau! ^^    Happy and Excited Kelvin   Quote: One advantage of marriage is that, when you fall out of love with him/her or he/she falls out of love with you, it keeps you together until you fall in again.  Quote 2: A perfect marriage is one in which "I'm sorry" is said just often enough.  Quote 3: Marriage is not a word - it is a sentence.   Poem by  Anonymous : I dreamed of a wedding of elaborate elegance, A church filled with family and friends. I asked him what kind of a wedding he wished for, He said one that would make me his wife.

       T oday we had Maths lesson again. But i didn't know that there was gonna be a small party going on after which for Rebakah's birthday! There were snacks n drinks served too. I brought a deck of poker cards for the lesson but we end up performing magic tricks instead! They were quite amazed(i tink) by some tricks i performed! Hee.. Managed to take a few photos too(visit my   urlLink webshots  ). There are also clips i've recorded but there is no way i could find to post on the net so for those who want them, feel free to find me in MSN and I'll send em to u. Too bad for 406 we had the party there n i tink it's pretty messy for their lesson later. OoPs! =p     Updates at 8.45pm!  Had lunch with SaiLam n went around Comics Connection n other shops... After tat went to play basketball with 2 Ivans, Guo Wei, Zhan Yuan, Yi Ren, Yi Peng and Jian Long. Really exercised a lot! In de end only Ivan, Guo Wei, Jian Long n me left at the CC playing with other people. Saw Dominic there too! Well anyway, i had a fun time there. Tml still have to go to Mr Kelvin's wedding. Almost forgot.. Hehe.. =p  Lucky Jason reminded me. My sis got discharged from the hospital earlier than expected today! In pretty good condition, only cannot laugh too much or move too much, or the back will hurt. Hehex.. Well then.. Gotta surf around den off to bed! Oh ya, 6 more days. Thanks to all visiting my blog here! N thanks to those who made comments here.. I'll continue to update it~    Birthday Cake   Quote: The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate.

       W ell then, finally publishing my first blog here! Hee... Saw plenty of blogs around n kinda thought of creating one myself too! I tried to post something here yesterday night but this web's like down or something... Hope this does not happen everytime! Okay then.. Let's start with what has been happening around recently...  Just 2 days before, on Tuesday, my sis had an operation something bout her spine not being straight and she was at SGH... Went to see her in the evening til nighttime n she was kinda drowsy n VERY thirsty! I always wonder why the people having operation can neither eat nor drink for the 24 hours period before an operation. Sai Lam experienced this before, I heard. After which, I had to take the long MRT ride from Outram to Pasir Ris and a bus back home. What a tiring day!  Yesterday, I had physics lesson n managed to stay focused! Well.. Or at least most of the time.. =p  After which, i went home instead of playing basketball cuz of the downpour! Well anyway, watched Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban! It was really nice and cool! Too bad that the original actor for Prof. Dumbledore passed away last year i heard. Now tat new actor looks kinda weird in that costume(it looks more like a pyjamas instead of a wizard's robe to me actually.. =p). Everyone's great in tat show man!  Expecto Patronum!!!  Whoo~ So cool! And i loved tat twist in de story! Tot Sirius Black was a bad guy at first.. Hee... Though i had the books, i didn't read it. Lazy i tink. *am i talking too much bout harry potter?* Went home n was very tired! No dinner somemore so have to take some instant noodles again. Sms-ed Tabby for quite a while. Heard tat she had a new nokia phone! Good for her. She'll be leaving today... Sobsob...   Now, today, woke up early n started writing this blog! Lucky today's physics lesson was cancelled. Phew! Still hav maths though. Tabby's leaving this morning at 7am! Hope she'll be all right n enjoy herself there! All the best to her! Now hav to start preparing to go to school.. Heaven eaten... Moreover tonite at 8pm Jason, Kheng Wei and me are going to help out at the Church for Mr Kelvin Lau's wedding... OuCh! >_   Updates at 10.40pm!  Jus got home not long ago! Morning went to play a bit of basketball and was kinda late for maths lesson! Never tio scolded though... He was teaching on Probability and was lame in a way bout dice, coins, poker n so on. He even asked us to bring poker n dice to school tml! After which, i ate n went home before going out again to watch The Be$t Bet which was mostly in  hokkien  and it wasnt a very good show. =(  However, because the air-con in the cinema was kinda like not working, Mu Hua, mainly, talked to the manager n we managed to get complimentory tix!

       H ad de chinese oral exam yesterday. I was the first one to leave the hall! Haha.. It was easier den I expected n i managed to read all de words correctly! Hee... The 2 topics were about discussing students going to Polytechnic instead of JC... and students complaining that they have too much remedials given during the holidays. Well, it was a pretty sick day for me yesterday because I ran 2.4km during PE(passed!) n made me feel unwell after tat. I tink it's because I did not eat anything in de morning and during recess I only had de watermelon sago. But before the oral i had prawn noodles(though with no much appetite) n a panadol after tat. I went to bed early yesterday because I was really exhausted so... ZzZzzz..............  This morning I continued on the fourth book(still). I only read it when im bored so im going at a snail's pace in reading the book. Well anyway, finally finished the whole book! Harry Potter stories are really nice! However, why is it that there MUST be a twist at de ending bout someone good is actually a villian? The fourth book was the best amoung the others to me(besides the 5th which i heaven touch on yet). Especially the TriWizard Tournament. It was really fantastic, about the 3 tests(though the second one sucked) and the 3 schools etc... Looking forward to see how the 4th movie will be like! Haha, so many things to show... I bet even 3 hours isn't enough! Well then.. Going to have lunch now.. So maybe later den continue updating..  maybe ... ^^

       T oday is Monday but no school, why? Cuz it's Youth Day!(read title)~ In de morning I already started 'botting' Ragnarok n til 8pm, my character increased 2 levels! Hmm, I went to Ezone at Tampines Mall to find Sai Lam, Ivan n Guo Wei. We had lunch together at de food court wif Jian Long also. After de quick lunch, we rushed to watch Spiderman 2 right away. It was a marvelous show(cant find a better word den MARVELous.. it's a Marvel Production anyway ^^)! I tink de show is not bad overall.. Jus tat.. Maybe not enough new action n fighting scenes. I mean, since spiderman 1 oready hav those boring fighting scenes, i tink they only add a bit of de story n nuttin new. Too much of de same thrill will make T-H-R-I-L-L spelled as B-O-R-I-I-N-G you know... ^^ I heard from Ivan(who read from a magazine) tat de director will make spiderman movies all de way to 9th! Can u believe it? NINTH! Wow... I wonder how many spiderman fans will exist by tat time comes. Anyway, during de show, there was a lunatic(kinda bald, wearing white, skinny, noisy, jeans, lame handphone tone, had a scar across his cheek[no.. jus kidding ^^]) disrupting de show. He was shouting to a man in front duno wat stuff n den went behind n shouted(again) 'EXCUUUSE ME!!!' den sat down. After a while, his handphone rang n most of de ppl there 'shhh' him. After tat i duno where he went. Wat-de-hell? Many got pissed of i guess... Lunatics... Mind of a 3-year old.. No wonder he got sooo excited by spiddie... I heard from ron later tat he went into Cinema Hall 3 too(ours is hall 1). Den he got dragged out by de arms by a staff there. C'mon, where's de security? Shoot! It'll be a better 'show' den spiddie 2... ^^"  We(me, ivan, guo wei, sai lam) went to meet ron in GV den went to pavilion to play CS wif jianlong n zhan yuan. There's a total of 5 coms there, mine, jianlong's, sailam's n ron's, ivan's n zhanyuan's, guowei's. I am in de same team wif Jianlong throughout de 4 maps(awp_map, cs_assault, fy_iceworld, fy_pool_day) played. I got top frag in assault n iceworld n jianlong de other two! Cool huh? We had nice teamwork man! Hahax... I went to buy a watch after playing at bout 5.30pm. We shopped around many places at TM n CS. Den I finally bought one tat costs $78(25 Hours). It's silvery n de surface is black in color. Hahax, i at first wanted one tat costs $138 but I very  thrifty  one(notice the word in  italics ). After which, jianlong, ron n me had dinner at Mc. I was very full wif de mcwings, mcnuggets, fries, drinks... We went around walk walk(help digestion ^^) den went home lor. Found out something secretive jus now. But can't publish here(since its suppose to be a secret).. So sorry, ppl! It's not my secret though, for The One reading these, relax, i'm not telling anyway... Hehehehehehe... *EviL GrinX* Okay, gotta stop here i guess. Gotta go to bed n hav a rest. Kinda sleepy. Buaix~~~  P.S: Credit to Jason's bloggy for quotes today.

       W oke up early in de morning today, I'm having the 'O's chinese listening compre! I brought my basketball with me too(cuz after de compre i'm playing bball with my frends). Well, the listening compre's not too bad. I compared my answers with my sis's(she's taking it too though she's sec 3 cuz higher chinese). We have two questions with different answers! The rest is the same. Well, hope my listening marks will pull me up instead of the other way round! It's soo cool~ It's broadcasted from the radio(instead of playing a stupid CD or tape then hearing from other classrooms different timings and get distracted ^^") all over singapore!  After the listening, we went to the school's bus stop bball court. Had a few matches that drained me out almost totally. Not bad lor, had lots of fun! Today more people went to play basketball(chunseng, ivanS, yiren, yipeng, elita, po tiong, woon han, zhanyuan, guowei and me), so more fun(though had to play full-court matches)! After that I went home and had my lunch(curry + bread + curry potatoes + a bit of rice). Was soo full! Oh, I borrowed comics from Sai Lam today at school also! KYO.. It's kinda like Rurouni Kenshin and like a copycat to me. But it's nice anyway, as the story continues... And most of all, it's free(i borrowed, remember?)! So why not? ^^"  Hee.. Joking only... Now back to the fourth book Harry Potter reading. For those who've already read it(even the 5th), don't laugh at me k? I'm trying to concentrate here! Haha, no lar, at least I start reading ritex? Better den nothing. Signx off now... All de best for those who took their listening today! =)  P.S: This post was posted on Saturday, 4 Jul 04(yesterday) but I reposted it due to some sort of error in de blogspot. I reckon it's fixed now so it's okay... ^^    Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire   Quote: When you play, play hard; when you work, don't play at all.

       O uch... Played basketball yesterday after school for many hours under the sun. Feeling so tired and my limbs(thighs especially) hurts a lot whenever I move! Argh... Somemore I played one on one with Ron yesterday(3 points only... cuz very very tired >  After school I went to TM to meet Jian Long and Sai Lam. Went to have lunch and then buy tix to watch spiiidy 2. They got give some free 3d spiiidy cards. Looks cool but I tink for young children lor.. But I liked it anyway... Keke... =p  Also, I'm looking for a watch to buy.. But still looking around for a good one. Jus got home not long and want to play Ragnarok Online(RO). Very nice now cuz got 3rd job class(news only.. not implemented yet)! Whoohoo~ Oh ya, tml got Listening Comprehension 'O's one... Haiz, hope I can do well to pull up my chinese paper 1 and 2's marks! I 'predicted' the papers that I will get either A2 or B3... But then, if B3 I tink I'll retake. Hmm, that's about it! Oh lastly, Ragnarok rocks! =p  P.S: If I didn't update my bloggy, there could be 4 possible reasons - No time(busy), Sleepy(or tired...), my house caught fire  again (keke ^^) or there are no events or anything exciting to write about.  P.S2: Since there are no specific happenings today, there will be no quotes! ^^"    Ragnarok 3rd Job Class

       A2 !!! I didnt expect it that I'd be so lucky! ^^  Hee... Got back the results today... And because of it, we managed to skip 1 period of F&N.. Lol! 6 people got A1s... My sis said "Huh? Your school very lousy xia..." when she knew bout it... Hehex.. Many people dont realli believe i got A2 xia.. Cuz i dont study much onex... Even my siblings and my parents! Haha... But..  Talent .. Hee, kidding lar! Lucky only~  ^^"  But den.. There are people who're not so lucky of course... ='(  I hope they'll learn to be more optimistic and look on the bright side no matter what... I mean, they do hav one last chance right? So i tink they should now buck up(if they're retaking) n put in their best efforts. It's not such a big deal anyway, it's jus a small part of 'Education', which is a small part of your  life ! Hope tat those who're retaking will do better n be happy with their grades! ^^  For myself, im considering whether to retake or not(must win sai lam! he got A1!)... But tink i giving up.. Concentrate on other subjects like mathematics... To go Poly, need 5 subjects.. Havin a total of 20 points, each subjects should score a average of 4 points. For me, I already for an A2.. So, my other subjects should be--->  English   B3-C5 Maths     B3-C6 C.Human   A2-B4 C.Science B3-C6(dont realli need, for my course) F&N       A1-B3  This is wat i aim to get lor... Will require hard work of cuz.. I cant depend on luck everytime u noe... Taking the WORST SCENARIO, C5+C6+B4+B3+A2=20! Exactly! So i can make it to Polytechnic safely! Im worried bout my english though... The course I want require at least a B4 for english... Oya, the course that i wan is Law & Management... If cannot then i'll choose Computer Engineering... =)  Haix... Gtg le... Maybe continue next time... Good luck to all~

We were playing Ragnarok and watchin the NDP at the same time. As usual, the parade was pretty much the same and in fact, boring me! Hahax... Well, at least there's Singapore Idol up next when de NDP show ended.  Singapore Idol is about showing how many singaporeans clown and humiliating themselves on TV! I tink there are many of the people trying 2 attract attention and they'd do anything 2 get themselves on TV! Haix... There arent good singers for Singapore Idol.. How could this thing go on? Hahax... I bet 90% of the people watchin SGI wanted 2 c de clowning acts... ^^    We then went to hav dinner(for me, supper) at Mc somewhere near my house n we den separated at the bus-stop at around 10.30... Well anyway, tabby's back at singapore at around 8 from malaysia! Hahax...

       P hew... Finaly can sign in this blog... Seemed to be something wrong wtih the cookie thingies. Fixed it at last! Thats why i couldnt update yesterday...(and i tot server was down or somethin.. hehex)  Well, yesterday we had national day celebration in school and it started with the ceremony and then recollection. We sang three songs and it seemed the upper secs are more patriotic(got such word?) then the lower secs... We were more fun-loving actually.. Hehe... We sang the songs and cheered happily but most lower secs were jus staring at each other doing nothing... Haha... Anyway, it was a pretty short day there was a prize-giving ceremony last minute. Oh, tabby got one of de top 20s for Cross Country! I didnt even know! Haha.. *i doubt she knows too* After watching a spectacular basketball match(Cougar VS Jaguar), we went to the library for the I-Chess competition! Got free registry to play against teachers(including sekhar!) and he was a popular demand! Anyway, I got a draw game with him(took years) but im happy already since i don't realli play it... I jus know the rules! =) We went to play basketball after which and then we realised we're late(meetin tabby they all @ small mac)! I went to YiPeng's house to hav a quick shower and then went to TM...  We were late for the movie I, Robot! Very late.. My sis told me... It happened that my sis n her frends were in the same cinema theatre! What a coincedence huh? She said we were very late and missed a lot and were... well.. Noisy. Haha.. The movie ended pretty fast(considerin the parts we missed) and YiPeng went home(if not, his mum'll.........) and the rest of us jus went around n go window shopping.. Kinda... YiRen, GhimBeng and i met up with Ron and SaiLam and we played CS at pavillion. It was very enjoyable as GhimBeng and I won a whole lotta matches(we same team)! YiRen kinda got bored(i tink?) and he left... The four of us then had dinner together and Ron and SaiLam went to my house til 9++! They were comin up with many  creative  ways of making de battery on their hp go low(so that their parents/brother won't call...)! Some of the ways are: Hanging the Pinball Game and it will keep vibrating, Play Space Impact/Snake n leave it there... etcetc.. Well, i sprained my ankle today before we played basketball n it seemed okay... UNTIL when i went to bed then it starts to hurt terribly >  Today, i played basketball with YiRen, Ivan, YiPeng, ZhanYuan n 2 other ppl(frends, but duno their names... Hehex...)... We saw a malay teenage lunatic boy playing basketball n he was self-entertaining himself... Though his shots were somewhat dangerous at times... Lol... O, the coffee shop there is selling drinks at 10 cents too! Good... Can save lotta money this way... Since im broke lately... Hehex.. I jus found out that the ankle starts to swell now... Geez... Shouldnt hav played basketball with a sprained ankle... But.. It's jus too tempting!!! Hee.. That's bout it... Gotta rest now... Tired...  P.S. Peng--> Why u n ur mum always seemed to be quarrelling? Mus study! Dont play too much computer games! Dont go out too often! It's for ya own good! =)  She's right in a way ya know... ;)  P.S2. P.S2 no new games... Soooo boring now!

       I'll  not be having any re-tests for this DT! Whoo~ Why? Well, even though I failed 3 subjects(1 maths, 2 science), I failed them borderline only... Maths I got 29/60(1 mark), physics 19/45(3 marks) and chemistry 21/45(2 marks)! So due to the large nu,ber of failures for these subjects, they caould only afford to give those who got F9s in the subjects! Yay~ ^^ Okay, back to Today...  Today, we had physics lesson doing some xperiment.. After the xperiment, Jason(n i didnt do anythin 2 stop, was enjoying actualli) somehow managed to loosen some nichrome wire on the ruler, turned the batteries upside down and hammered them in and messed the virable resistor thingy! Haha... Wonder which pair later taking Physics would hav our table? Anyway, after i went back 2 class i noticed my wallet was GONE! It's the 2nd time oready... Lucky lucky lucky for me, I managed to find it in the science lab and thank God again that everything was safe and untouched. =) Anyway, today's Sherilyn's b'dae n she's carryin lots of presents! Haha.. Didnt get her anythin cuz i didnt know its her bdae.. Well.. then again.. even if i knew i will not make de effort 2 go n buy.. hahax.. ^^"  After skool we had a boring SS-SSS! Haix...

       S orry once again but I gotta make this short and simple... Jus updating stuffs that've been going on this week.  Well, I got my DTs all back now... Failed chem by 4 marks, physics by 2 marks and maths by 1 mark(got add some marks... failed anyway >  Anyway, we had Cross-Country yesterdae! I met up wif Tabby, Sailam and Yipeng at 201's mac in the morning to hav breakfast. Saw Hafiz and his family(his bro resembles him very much) havin breakfas there too. It seemed like it was going to rain when we're eating(dark sky and very windy...) and it did when we reached there. Jus drizzling though... We started the run soon after we got there(ron was sprinting all the way) and soon we kinda got separated. After somewhat 2km or so, I saw ron waiting ahead and then came back... He said he was havin a headache(too bad~ =p) and he didnt get the top 20. After the running, i felt like vomiting my MiLo.. Hahax... Drank too much in the morning perhaps? Well, tabby's reeali fast compared to the other gers and she even won many of us! We soon got a badge(so much for the runnnin) and we went to take bus 28(or is it? cant remember...). Tabby alighted at her house's stop while the rest of us went to the interchange.  Yipeng and I went home and ron went to sailam's house. I went home and rested/hav lunch etc.... Then went out again to SL's house to meet up and then to TM. We went to the arcade den well... Whatever. Really tired and my body aches(espcially the bottom tip bone of my spine... I fell on Friday when playing basketball n all...). Whoo~ Friday's half-day(National Day celebration) and Sat-Tus all holiday! On Monday(9th August) it's national day and got Singapore Idol somemore! Yay~ Good.
