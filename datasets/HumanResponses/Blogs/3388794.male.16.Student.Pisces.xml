      black spot sneakers, the converse allstar design. they are made fairly trded, and are made to kick phil knight(nike)'s ass. the whole idea of them bieng an anti-coperate coperation. a genius idea which will bring a fairer traded shoe to the top of the market, and give a company who thought theyd be rich using sweatshop labour, i giant kick in the balls. well the website explains it better than i do. so check it out.   http://www.blackspotsneaker.org/   theyre shoes are the same price as normal converse allstars, and when you buy them hopefully you buy a share in the company. making it a cooperative. nike suck. nike sucks. nike sucks.   nike sucks for one reason and one reason only, they are responsible for charvers,scally's,twockers,neds,townies,skeefs,chorers,ronaldo, rivaldo,  and finally arsenal football club..for anyone who supports them...oh come on it has arse in the name.   its very sunny outside, i may play some frisby, if i do. ben i won't cry. i promise.

      well that sucks, my dad just yelled at me for losing something, and i couldnt go ot bed untill i found it...needless to say i didnt, but i am now too tired to sleep...:( and so i think i'll spend the rest of the night thinking, and talking to myself about nothing...aint life sucky like that. oh well. so anyway...i miss seeta...i think i am going to take her to shipley glen, its lovely up there, make a picnic...but its a suprise...so shhhh. my inner child is apparently 16...bout right...thats me....seeta...mmm...oh well.     with my one last gasping breath, i'd apologise for bleeding on your shirt    i'd do anything for anyone who cared enough to talk to me...for anyone who was my friend, for anyone i love. for you. (you know who you are people).    she fixes her lips, they always look perfect... she wonders what i'll wear   she is, she is. and finally to end on something by me.   cherry red lips, that walk on by, and in my confession, i will say i loved them like the way they move, the way they talk to try, this girl will stay written about in my diary with cherry red lips that walk on by.  candy apples and chocolate remind me of you

      i watched a good ol' film tonight,nuns on the run. anyone ever heard of it? it was fairly emusing, however, in my opinion those men were far to up for dressing in womens clothing. talking to lucy, which always makes me laugh, shes great bless her, i dont think she knows how much she means to people, or what a great person she is. she makes me laugh too much. i love her.

      why doesn't shit ever come off shoes? why do you feel the urge to fart in public?..just me then. the sun and the moon are the same size, but i still get mugged at night time.  well today was fun. i spent alot of it with sqeet, which was nice. i see alot in her, that i dont see in other people. i have to go to durham on monday night, when i could have spent the evening with sqeet which would have been better, but oh well. actors pay prices, so do astronaughts. can you imagine the vehicle tax you have to pay on those things, for shame.if you notice alot of commas it is because i have wrongfully bieng accused of using bens writing style. bastard. bitch in a bonfire, which by the way makes an interesting sound, and colourful flames.*ooooooh*  ive wanted sqeet for so long. im glad i finally have her.

      im sick of bieng asked to make myself like liam nelson by miss. i know hes a good actor and a decent guy, but, its demoralising. i wanna hold my own as an actor. well i guess we cant have everything. the truth, am i an good actor? depends who you talk to. most poeple say i am, to my face. but am i. i need honesty. if thats honest fine. but if its not. what am i doing. well lets just workd hard, and i'll see you in hollywood...lets hope.   if you dont know me now, if you dont remember me, or whati have to say, maybe someday you will. I'm also sick of people devaluating how i feel. 'oh it cant be that bad.'etc. well good for you. you keep your opinions i'll keep mine. i guess everybody has problems, but sometimes i wanna feel like mine are important.

      had my first exam today. then i went to town to seeta, we lay next to eachother staring at the sky, well i was. hehe, seeta didnt want me to leave bless her, i wish i didnt have to. needless to say tea was cold. oh well, i had a laugh, liam and the possy were there, funny as fuck, which is suprisingley not funny.  well i didnt think it was on the whole a bad day. seeta uses my t shirt as pj's, never a bad thing, but shes nicked of with my huddy:(. oh well. sacrifices have to be made at some point anyway.    the latest in my emo scrap book:   fake plastic smiles surgeons through files, is this tangeable this mask wearable, would it be too bold, as for me to say that i love you, love you because your real.  i know the lights will break the makeup will melt, and beauty is difigured, but still i wanna be there, wanna be there with you.  your smile lights, the dead angels wings, even though i know fame, dances like ghosts, across dark mirrors, i hate the way, that it all hinges, on nothings and somethings

      aah the wonderful world of gcse's, which i find utterly useless. lets face it, acting Jo, what were you thinking, selling big issues in Durham. its a living i guess, i have a passion for the arts. if i work hard enough i could be a top class actor...a big aim in life. Dustin Hoffman is my favorite actor, he has awesome controll, and an ability to create a character.  i spent a couple of minutes in a miror to perfect my character, not nearly long enough. the tutors on the course im going into seem really nice, they seem like they'll be able to help me alot. packing up stuff today ready to move, getting nostalgic.  im suppose to be getting an a in drama , its something i really want to do, i love to act. creating someone different is soothing, breaks me away form the world for a little.  i think that i have a shot at making something of myself with acting. lets hope.

      well today was fun, i think i broke me.i mean there are injuries, and thn theres injuries, fortunatley me making an ass of myself managed to pull my brain away from the pain, to face severe embarresment.this of course would sound witty if i wasnt a fool. hehe.    had a band pratice form hell, utterly apauling, everybody else was fine but i couldnt concentrate. who knows why. hehe, seeta looked utterly bored, guess there wasnt much for her to do, then sit admiring adam, bless her.   talking to lucy again, that always cheers me up, shes had a nack for doing that, even when we were little. dammit i think im turning into so tragic teen series like dawsons creek, maybe im just romantic or something, anyhoo.   chimapnzes in leather, thats what its almost all about, they go behind bad toupets, as well as mic swinging front men like me. but i dont like the fact groupies wanna sleep with you, but the people you actually want, never turn around. just walk on by.that or theyre too close. dammit.

      after months of practice i managed to swing the mic, good ol' me...hehe...this has gone better than various other projects like putting my pants on the right way round. gornall im bruised you bitch, guess that punch on friay got me more than i thought, id slap your tit after the english exam...random act of violence.  my sister is playing the grease soundtrack, which i wouldnt mind so much, if it wasnt bollocks, nor if she didnt sing along as if she enjoyed it.  must revise for my IT exam, but i cant bring myself to opening a book, revision is a mouse click away, but my finger cant be arsed,i think i work it too hard on this thing. go my tbs tee through the mail today, which was a nice suprise, not expecting it till later.  we've found a suitable house in durham, which means i have to pack away my sleeping bag and my make shift card sleeping mat, which i enjoyed sleeping on. preping for sians gig, my guitar is broked so i need to borrow soembodies, thats if i  dont sell my drum kit before the gig, in which case i will be able to buy me a new one. unfortunatley my rock and roll lifestyle currently leaves me with a bus ticket and 15p in copper. so i could do with the money. how cheap am i. well gottafew things up my sleeve for the gig including mic swingign... should be fun, unless i poke out birthday girls eye...which knowing me is probable.   and its nostalgic times like these, where i wish that we'd kissed and made a place in memories, your excuses roll around in my head,

      i've spent half the night watching a pile of bollocks on tv. hypnotism ruined my life,well thanks a lot, needed that before i went to bed, its one of those great things i needed to know, like don't eat yellow snow, or if you can't afford laundrey bills wear your underwear inside out.chirst theres a program on about britains best buildings for gods sake,what makes it more boring is i want to talk to seeta for some reason, shes been in my thoughts alot lately, *shrugs* guess thats nothing new.   but seriousley any channel putting on a prgram about buildings has there problems.keep on thinking bout lucy too. how we used to be mr and mrs mermaid, haha...made ben cry, used to have a real bad crush on her, geeks love geeks i figure haha- you know what i mean lu :oP  bad toupets thats what its all about. haha. i figure a man without a bad toupet is like a bee without hunny, toupets make a man. making me relativley girly compared to the over 50's.  i hate people who say 'im not racist i just dont like pakis' ,its like wtf do you call it then? and why does theyre origin make them less human anyway. dumbass townies, get a cap that fits, thats what i say, as well as, im sorry jason but burberry doesnt make hats...its fake...sorry jason but it is....it also does not make huddy's or socks.:( sorry.   well im just passing away time where i cant sleep away. ive taken time to  think about this, and i really dont wanna leave.oh well guess we all have to jump off the edge sometime and well this is me jumping.  i must seem like i have one or too mental health probelms but i can assure you that i am pretty sane, although slightley traumatised by various mishaps involving wigs and leotards...for anyone who wants to know what thats about...tough.

       'I never said I'd take this lying down,'  i feel sad for some reason but do not know why, like i'm empty, running out of steam i know whatever i do next is an adventure, but i cant help but feel hollow. like ive never really found anything. thats is untill its too late, bit like being stabbed in the back really.  'I never said I'd take this lying down,' and i won't there are people that i never want to let go of, things i want to forget but people who have stood there, never questioned, and still held my hand. I've never really realised untill ive missed it but seeta was the best friend i never thought i had, i guess i was too caught up wishing for more, i still am but i guess now its not there as much, im starting to miss the real things. oh well. im realising now as im leaving what a jerk ive been to people, you all know who you are, and im sorry. ive found friends in the last month that im just gonna lose.  this is a bit of a depressing entry.I had my german speaking today, which was complete bollocks, my presentation wasnt long enough, so i had 7 minutes of question, in which i managed to use the entire english dictionary, and 2 minutes of total silence. geeze. mailed the kkk today, told em what racist jerks they are. in this world we shoudlnt care whos got what colour skin, but what we should all do so that we can see another sunrise.  the words drip like honey, i guess this means something, to someone pleading,  to sing more sad songs, you start to feel cold like, the ashes on my bed, is what i said or didnt say, that kills you so slowly,  chorus well i guess this hurt more the first time, i hope you know, I'm not pretendingX2

      her stars said that i would be ok, i find little comfort in it. how can i be ok, ho can i feel ok, i am leaving my life behind, while some may want to get away, i am not one of them. it is good for my sister, it is a fresh start for her. but for me? i don't want one, i would like to stay.   what would my stars say, you will find sorrow at leaving, you decide whether things are ok? maybe, then i decide to be sad, not ok, sat in dark corners. maybe she'll move on? i don't want to be left behind. that is selfish, me all over, selfish. has god conspired with evryone in my life to make me troubled, alone. if so, why? maybe i dont like him for it. maybe he has his reasons. tell me.

      the light breaks through the cloud, like a hole in the sheeets, i listen to sad songs, they tell me about heart break, something i dont want to go through again. at the moment i don't feel like adam lazzara, i dont feel like john nolan, at the moment i am okay. i have spent a day doing very little. my hands are shaking and i don't know why, maybe its just me. i wrote a song today, its pretty poor.  the lights are one, your centre stage, its my life but i find you at the centre, your made up;as pretty as the first time, that my eyes saw yours walk past mine, take a bow sunk deep inside my thoughts, it's my life but maybe you stole the show, and i'm not scared by the thought of forever, we can talk about nothing and the weather,  i wrote about it, but i'll forget it i tried to kill it, but I've lost it, just you make sure i tell you before i go, just you make sure that you know before i go,  the stage has emptied, your still there, its my life but your the only one there, theyre my size tens but you can have them, something to hold onto while i'm gone, take a bow sunk deep inside my thoughts, it's my life but maybe you stole the show, and i'm not scared by the thought of forever, we can talk about nothing and the weather,  wrote about it, but i'll forget it i tried to kill it, but I've lost it, just you make sure i tell you before i go, just you make sure that you know before i go,  if you'd sing me one more song before i go, tell me about how i love you so, if you'd sing me one more song before i go, tell me about the best day its been,  if you'd sing me one more song before i go, tell me about how i love you so, if you'd sing me one more song before i go, tell me about the best day its been,

      the weather has changed with my mood, it is cloudy, inside me it is dark, cold and lonely. i spent hours last night wondering about leaving. I will miss some people so much that it will be unbearable, no more midnight skating trips, no more sugar highs, no more song writing. be sure of this, there is not a moment when i will not feel so lonely thinking of you all, i will miss you all that much.   the rain begins to fall inside and out, i feel cold, shattered. teach me to cope someone.  it has been so hard going a day without seeing sqeet, a week at a time will be hard. the knowledge of her bieng mine, and that alone, will let me survive. the sound of these very words makes me shudder, it is cheesy, it is cliched, but as i think about this cliche, i know how very true, how very sincere that it is. bye for now.

      The sun has warmed the ground, if it were the sea it would be calm, settled. the concrete of this industrial wonderland has become golden, a change from the dull grays and blacks.the gig went pretty well; seeta was amazing....but thats nothing new; she always is.    i watched her make her hair, and she'll paint her eyes, the silence of that moment, makes me see her beauty,  i watched her write a note, with a pen in her hand, the complexity of that moment, makes me see her beauty  And childishley I'll watch this moment for way too long, and wonder why it hurts when I've finished with this song,  i watched her sing a song, with a mic infront of her, the echo of that moment, made me see her beauty,  i watched her take paper, signed it 'i'll love you always', the indifference of that moment, makes me se her beauty,  And childishley I'll watch this moment for way too long, and wonder why it hurts when I've finished with this song,  your a coloured shape in my greytone world, so looking through the kaleidoscope i see you, that special dot that looks so different from the rest, your a coloured shape in my grey tone world,   for you.

      there is a shiver in the air, i feel slightley empty. i miss her. the sky was miserable again, shades of grey and white indifferently hovered above me. there is water above, below and around me. the puddles make background noise, it is decieving, it is a happy sound, the weather however is far from it.  in quiet misconceptions in the back of my mind, i wonder where the hell portugal is anyway, its on the end of spain somewhere? like its been kicked in the ass perhaps. d  the sky is black, with the break of blue currently, i feel tired, perhaps drawn, today has been busy, buses everywhere, lucy's was cool, aww im gonna miss her when i go.   i miss seeta, so much right now, i feel slightley incomplete when shes not with me. we picked out the bed for our vancouver home...we're not gonna be havingproblems with style i can tell.  love you sqeet.

      the rain beats down on this industrial sky line, the sky looks dark; grim. I'm holding on to nothing that wil happen in the near future. i hate the way that i have to say so many goodbyes, there are a few people i won't be saying goodbye to, you know who you are, if you want me to say goodbye, i will bow down and carry on, but i will therefore only ever want to exist, i will never want to live again. i want to say thank you to all of those who have carried me, over the recent months, not many of you know but, i have been suffering with a saught of depression, not clinical, but what can only be described as emptyness; thankyou for lifting me and draging me that extra yard. thankyou for holding me up so i could take the punches, the hugs and the kisses.  thank you, all of you.  but especially, you.....you know who i mean.

      The sunset pastel shades form yellow to blue, for the first time in a while i've seen the beauty of the world. the complexity of the sky to create such a feat, makes me see sense. the world was beautiful, once upon a time. but the world of size nines four by fours and 2 tonne concreteis upon us. the streetlights of a suburban nightmare have slowly taken over the horizen; sunsets stay for hours, the orange of streetlights dressed up, make it last longer. but it is not 'pretty' it is like frankenstein's monster, a mismatch, distgusting in its complexity, but tonight the sky has taken back a yard, won a battle, it is a shame it will lose a war.   I sit here and wonder what made me write such a noible language, surely it cannot be this world, it is too fake. it is full of anger, it asks too much of too many bad questions. I am sure you will agree that the world is slowly falling down a sink, slowly bieng washed down, like a spider in a bath tub by a scared mother.   I wonder at how life is suddenly better, how it is that i have become so substantial a personnality, that finally love isn't a bitch, it doesnt hurt. it leaves a glow, there is no need for stage names masks and sheets. thank you. i can be me again.  i love you.

      today hs been tiring, the day has started and ended badley, much like a gareth gates song. it started badley because of exams, and ended badley because, well it hasn't yet but im sure somehow it will...maybe a majorly huge argument or something. the middle of the day was prety good(this is where it isn't like a gareth gates song.) and tailed into the evening very well indeed. Ben is also a gareth gates song, small, inconsequential, and a pain in the ass to listen to. revenge is sweet to the taste. it also smells like edam...no wait thats ben too. found an excellent band called hot rod circuit, anyone ever heard of 'em? now i look like it almost everything is like a gareth gates song, the internet-slow and anoying. charvers-again slow and annoying. the ceese in the fridge-out dated and gone off. heres a game kids, see how many things you know are like gareth gates.  bye bye everybody

      the sun has turned in, it has said goodnight, to the moon it is dayime, like an owl, it eerily keeps watch over the night sky, silentley ,ever knowing, ever watchful. the city glows pale orange. i feel alone. where is she? what is she doing now? is she missing me? i know i miss her. she found the cut that i made on my arm, because i felt alone. it has nothing to do with her, and was infact made long before this romantic venture. she makes me feel like im not alone, but tonight i feel isolated, she isn't here, and when i think,i just want her to be here with me. i watch the clock hoping she is online, but alas every 15 minutes i will check, she isn't there. she has other things to do i guess, i like to think i let her have her independace. i don't like the guys who dont trust their girlfriends. i do. i trust you. i love you.    'and as for now I'll sing the saddest songs and sit alone and wonder'   speaks for it's self really. i wonder where you are

      The sun has turned the sky a pale yellow, the clouds lit up a little bit. the trees are swaying inpatiently. i am currently bored senseless, talking to sqeet though so it aint all bad. the flowers are swaying in time with the trees, i have noticed. young couples are walking across the halls of residence, ready for a night out. but i am home, why am i home? because i'm drained, i feel so tired.    if you were to send me on a quest, would i aquiest, to this noble request, i know i would, i know i would, but would you miss me, would you miss me   as cliched as it is, i'd do anything fo her....well maybe not anything, but pretty damn close.   the cloud has made a hand in the sky, it reaches out to another hand, another hand in the sky. the juxtapositioned houses add a backdrop to this beautiful occurance. the city dances with excitement. the gig is coming up, i can hardley wait, its gonna be fun. Andy's band are cool, indie kids the lot of em but oh well.   love you sqeet

      so people have actually started reviewing my work on fiction press, i personnally think it is crap, but they seem to like it. maybe its just my emo kid getting the best of me. The emo boy in the bad toupet, is having a bad day, the morning/lunch was great...hehe...we shall not get into why. but this afternoon ive felt, i don't know, transparent, maybe just plain invisible, which is strange.   I keep on wanting things to happen over night, like a miracle where we dont have to move, well whatever, we know that aint happening. i started putting a minidisc together for the bbq, its sounding hot. i wonder if our band will play, it would be cool if we did. but i dunno me and ben might just go all dashboard style, that would be cool...there is no alcohol to be consumed, although my sister has assured me she has a solution, which means we all get a bit a booze.   what has happened to this world. what happened to the individual? schools seem more concerned about pushing through clones, than real personnality. Power to the individual, individuals make ideas. never forget that, i will be one of those. they aint touching me. I was watching friends today, and i coudn't help but notice how artifical it was, like it was hollow. plastic. maybe its just me but there isn't sincerity. I like the films and shows that show sincerity. A walk to remember, they show emotion, it's deep, you can feel what the characters are feeling. your their breathing with them, taken on their ups and downs. amazing acting in my opinion, i hope i can show that sincerity, i hope i can show something real, something deep.  the phone rings too often, what do i do, acrophobia is a character flaw of mine. i hate new people, makes me nervous.  the stars are not wanted now,  put out everyone, pack up the moon,  distmantle the sune, pour out the ocean and sweep up the wood, for nothing now , can come to any good.  that is my favorite poem ever, or at least a section of it. i feel like now were leaving that is there a point, ive built my life on this place. it makes no sense to leave now. i guess maybe someday I'll understand, maybe someday, but for today, i will be sad.

      the silence that followed, left me thinking. i will miss her too. geeze i was in love with her before we went out. i figured it was just a pipe dream, well dreams come true i guess....right?...well mine did. I like the way we could talk about nothing for as long as we want, the way we can stay silent and still feel comfortable.   Nathan and sqeet make me laugh, so i had a good day today, managed to fix my drumkit, and i made only two mistakes in practie, so it was a great practice. considering i didnt know two of the songs. heehee.  love you sqeet.

      i assume by your silence, that you've never missed this, or the way the sky fell through, the first time that i saw you, the way that you'd hate to tell me, that maybe someday it will finish, or the way that i'd fade and melt, everytime you devaluate what i felt,   you wear your heart on your sleeve, but today you'll still wear masks [i was, am, and always will be here]   i assume by your silence, this is something you've felt, and today it still rains lightley, it quietly soaks as you fight me, did you like they way i said that, like the time when i got metaphoric, i'm sorry but this isnt that time, i dont know metaphors for i love you,  just something i am working on, at the moment, a nostalgic collection of lyrics put together, me thinks its ok. well today its raining, meh, oh well, went bowling with sqeet yesterday which was interesting, you see i'm what you could call the bowlingly challenged, in that i can't bowl. her friends seem ok, although, i  think i insulted mary too much...i should really stop bieng sarcy...might do me some good. less sarcasm...less muggings,me thinks its a plus. with very few negatives.

      so this is it, the night before the move; i am staying till saturday, but its feeling kinda close. seeta was very good in yerma. I'm the luckiest guy on earth, she makes bad days feel better. today i felt so comfortable lying next to her, to use a cliche, like the stars had alligned. its for real. and in these moments i am content, when i'm lying there,i like just to look at her, watch every little movement she makes, not wanting to blink in case i miss something. so this sounds a lttle stalkerish, but you know what i mean.  wrote a song. this is for any girl who feels like they've been used. or any guy whos in love with a girl whos been used. you'll get it.   can you take the hint about a u-turn "sorry" the windows tint as you yearn feeling useless around a dead end, she's running off steam from a girlfriend, Can you feel it about a moment, i said a hold on as you ferment, i said your fake maybe like a poser, put a poster up looking at a girlband,  Your best friend is her plastic expression, but maybe I'm not sure about your intention, and your fake but she'll keep you guessing, A thousand more and she will cave in,   can you take the hint about a u-turn "sorry" the windows tint as you yearn feeling useless around a dead end, She's running off steam from a girlfriend, Can you feel it about a moment, i said a hold on as you ferment, i said your fake maybe like a poser, put a poster up looking at a girlband,  Your always best left in the tension. do you love her or are you just pretending, just make sure you know where shes going, a thousand more and maybe you'll cave in  can you take the hint about a u-turn "sorry" the windows tint as you yearn feeling useless around a dead end, She's running off steam from a girlfriend, Can you feel it about a moment, i said a hold on as you ferment, i said your fake maybe like a poser, put a poster up looking at a girlband,  you dont deserve her at all stop everything put it all away, you don't deserve her at all drop your tools take off your coat, you dont deserve her at all your a lush so dont work again, you don't deserve her at all drink and drink another trouble,  (you dont deserve her at all) can you take the hint about a u-turn "sorry" the windows tint as you yearn feeling useless around a dead end, She's running off steam from a girlfriend, (You don't deserve her at all) Can you feel it about a moment, i said a hold on as you ferment, i said your fake maybe like a poser, put a poster up looking at a girlband,   see? get it now? well gee, have fun evrybody. i love you.

      Tomorow I'm going to watch the school's production of yerma, I'm sure it'll be good, miss appleton is a good director. Seeta is in it, I'm sure she'll be awesome, i always think shes great...i might tell her differently, but what the hell...now you know.   Something about the packing made me think; do i have anything useful to bring? some divine knowledge to share? the answer is do i hell. it scares me; what do i have to offer. a mediocre (spelling) actor, with maybe a little bit of natural talent, nothing else.   scoury is an excelent actor, and i have alot of respect for him because of it. i hope to be as good as him, maybe someday i will be. who knows? liam is alo a good actor, and i also respect him. i hope they all do well.  well goodbye.

      i have done nothing today, i intend this untill tomorow. I am not leaving untill saturday but it's feeling kinda close. a substantial amount of money wil be coming my way soon.   I discussed travelling back to bradford with the mother. it will cost me £12 for a return ticket, making t damn easy for me to travel here. Love doesnt have boundaries i figure, just hurdles. jumping over them is the test, and i think i will pass, i know i will pass.   the sky is a landscape of its own this evening, and i feel lost in it. it lights up the leaves on the trees, making them golden, more amazing then i have seen them before. days like these make me glad to be alive.

      Lost. Where Do i Begin? Should i start with the good bit, the dawson moment? The bit where i say that i don't want or need anyone else? thats the good bit. the bad bit, i am going on a journey, she can't come with me. no one can come with me. my little book has been filled. filled with memories, things i want to keep. but the only thing i really want to take away with me is her.   my nightmare; open spaces, with no one i know. bieng alone, alone in a crowd. i am so afraid, im scared because there i no one to hold my hand. shes not there to hold my hand.   i will of course make it work, as long as she's happy with that. i'm really not much to hold onto. but i'm not going to let her go. this all sounds a bit tragic. but i guess i dont care. i'm done with stuffing all my problems into a box. it all comes out eventually. or maybe i should. i don't know.

      the internet has reached our new home. i have to say this aint my home. its four or so walls, pout together where i live and sleep,for the time bieng. but it isn't my home. it's not where i want to be. i miss my home.  Durham has its perks, the normal people to charv ratio is 5:1, meaning that i can say what i like...pretty much. thats the bad thing, there is no danger. i am home again on the 13th. see you then.  ciao   Hope dangles on a string, like slow spinning redemption, winding in and winding out.
