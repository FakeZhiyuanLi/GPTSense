      ...you're the only person that i want holding me right now and the only person i never want touching me again.  I awoke tot he sound of someone falling, my heart raced as i closed my eyes to see who had fallen but i then realized it was i who had fallen, fallen back into reality, my room.

      This is the break in the bend, this is the closest of calls. This is the reason you're alone, this is the rise and fall.  If it makes you less sad, I will die by your hand, I hope you find out what you want, I already know what I am.           "Now I believe that lovers should be draped in flowers and laid          entwined together on a bed of clover and left there to sleep,          left there to dream of their happiness." - Conor Oberst

      I;m back. parallel universe. as you fucking look around there could be so many things your mind cannot take in and process...to tell you what there is. there is. this isnt going to make sense but i dont intend on making this easy for you. what you see is various still images. individual images taken. as each image is placed infront of you and is put into motion you see a moving picture perceived as real. but [there is] a space inbetween each image. and if you look closely there is the gap. but if you take another image and fill in that gap completely, you will be subcontiously taking it in and it will come to you as youre walking down the street to meet a time, an idea will come into your head and youll wonder where youve seen it before because its so familiar. physics. dimensions. [there is] a lot more than waht we see. [there is] a parallel universe. what dimenion are you in. lost. drifting through images of different minds and forms.--------:::....:--||I am the hated enemy of all one dimensional realities\\||>>>.....::::-->>..]

      this song has a rope around my neck right now...  It's our time to shine through the down Glorified by what is ours We've fallen in love It was the best idea I ever had  Today I fell and felt better Just knowing this matters I just feel stronger and sharper Found a box of sharp objects what a beautiful thing  Do you want a song of glory Well I'm fucking screaming at you

      Ok, so i was thinking tonight, and I've never made more sense to myself in my entire life....[love]------when you see a soul in someone, you love them. no matter what you love them. as a friend, or family. and if you can feel their soul come inside of you and wrap around your heart..you love them more than a friend or more than family..more than anything you have ever loved in your entire life. and i have never been so right. ---. [life]----youre standing out in the cold with your face pressed up against a window looking inside at a nice warm home, and you want to be inside more than anything to feel the warmth that you pain for but youre trapped outside...and life should be the other way around. you should be inside, in the warmth looking out at the cold, smiling feeling secure and sheltered. but its an illusion..we're in another dimension out in the cold and as close as the warmth may seem..its not even there. and youll keep standing there wanting it so bad.------- live.

      did you tell all your friends that you've got your gun to my head and my hands shake as you place your finger over the trigger. What did you think your role was in this story, did you think that I would buy into every word you were preaching to me...words that I don't think you even believed. and maybe someday I'll cross your path and will be able to look into your eyes and just laugh.

      razed on toronto ground falling through ice breaking faces climbing walls listening to the grunge that corrupted minds and ended with a single bullet from a shot gun heard by only the now dead.it once had a smile. lifeless youth with more life in destruction than anything else. pain sorrow and anger with twisted happiness and the illusion of freedom and bliss combined to make the sickest of all generations. the most beautiful and weakest of all, held together by nothing because no one fights for anyone, we're broken. were all alone and the days dont seem to change. we put eachother underground and cry after the damage, theres nothing to lose when you force yourself to believe you dont care. nothing to gain when you want to move lower because the sick feel for it all is overwhelming and delicious. our brains feed off inner universes that will get us no where way too fast in the one were supposed to be active in. so the good ones will explain and tell you where to go and its only about you and your choices..theyre the good ones with lost hearts and misleading words, you can do anything and be anywhere. but where am i, where are you? here. so walk. and youll still be here, hasnt anyone told you there isnt anywhere else...escape the pain for a new and find another that will attempt to save you from it. its all in your head, everything you believe  can save you, no one can do it for you, only yourself...havent you gathered how sick i am. how little control i have, how much i love to be the ruthless demented shit i am becomming. and youre not meant to save me, im already saved. here it is, its my life and ill miss my chance over and over, but hey death isnt here yet....it will come later,  i shouldnt worry now. depressed? negative? what if i told you this is what i believe to be positive and theres a huge smile on my face? hah well id be lying..but what if.... no. hey dont fool yourself with suicide its a gimmick now, its overrated and far too popular but the actual action is quite rare. watch me drown, its surreal. oh and ill go on forever, again.

      I have nothing to say tonight so I'll paste lyrics from a song i love...lets out some of what's inside of me       I talk to you every now and then I never felt so alone again I stop to think at a wishing well My thoughts send me on a carousel  Here I am standing on my own Not a motion from the telephone I know not a reason why Solitudes a reason to die  Just you wait and see As school life is a It is a woken dream Aren't you feeling alone?  I guess its just another I guess its just another I guess its just another night alone  Now as I walk down the street I need a job just to sleep in sheets Buying food every once in a while But not enough to purchase a smile  A tank of gas is a treasure to me I know now that nothing is free I talk to you every now and then I never felt so alone again  Just you wait and see As school life is a It is a woken dream Aren't you feeling alone?  I guess its just another I guess its just another I guess its just another night alone
