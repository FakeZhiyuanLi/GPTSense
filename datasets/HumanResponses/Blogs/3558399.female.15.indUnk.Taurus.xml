      What would I wish if I could be granted anything in the world?? Truthfully, I have no clue. I wish that I could have known my grandparents on my dad's side. I wish that republicans wouldn't be so war happy so less tears were shed every year over losing loved ones. I wish that I could have esp for a day so I knew exactly what everyone's thinking. I wish I knew who exactly my significant other to be is so I wouldn't have to leave my tender cravings for love behind in my head. I have too many things that are both 2 second epiphanies, and things that hit down to the bone marrow and my heart. My heart calls out too many things that my head gets in the way with. What I want to know if which I should listen to. Do I go with what's practical and logical, or do I go with what I really want?? I felt like Jeffy was trying to put me on a guilt-trip when we were coming home from the gym today. We had to face very bad traffic, so he was in a bad mood. I know he didn't want to be there, but he made me feel so bad about it like I forced him into it. I kept silent. I didn't want to upset him anymore, or even risk getting a linguistic whip-lash. Do only fools have hope?? I thought that after we got through the traffic and we were talking about Joy. He asked if I'd talked to her lately, and so I told him that I saw her on Sunday. Jeffy wanted to know if she'd be joining us on Sunday. I told him that she said she wanted to, she had her plans open, but she didn't know yet. Jeffy said that really meant that she's being nice about blowing our family off. I wondered if it was true because of everything she said. I still had hope after that conversation that she might be there on sunday. Maybe I am a fool. Do I have hope where there should be none?? Megan's coming to the gym with me tomorrow. At least, she arranged to go with me there. Jeffy should  be thrilled. Nearly evertime I go to the gym, I see this guy who works there. There's something incredibly drawing about him. He's not incredibly tall (definitely not short either though), he must be latin, Mexican, or of some other similiar ancestry. He has a great smile, and an even better sense of humor. The strange thing is that I'm not even sure what his name is. It might be Jaimie, but I don't know that for sure. I don't know him all that incredibly well, even though I think he's sexy doesn't mean that I don't have stronger feelings for someone else (especially because I do). I think I'm going to go take my contacts out soon, and then sleep. Sweet dreams to a very special someone.  "When in doubt, make a fool of yourself.

      I hear people say all the time that at this age you're in the stage of becoming who you choose you want to be in your future. There are so many things that influence you. The media, your family, friends, school, and most importantly-yourself are the most basic key factors in it. I'm not sure if I really even know myself that incredibly well. I know my full name but there's more to life than the name you go by. There's more to it than each day that goes by that changes you in some way or other. I wonder what it's about, and why we're forced to go through it. I got to go driving again today. This time it was in LaCrosse. We had to go pick Nicole up at Downtown Dental. We then made a trip out to the super wal-mart so Nikki could get her pictures developed, Spande made me drive around the parking lot the entire time she was in there. We switched off and then went to get Bree. A lot of the time I drove today was in downtown LaCrosse. Well, Bree started driving once we picked her up, and we went back to the super wal-mart, and then to Kwik Trip. I got to start driving again, and we went downtown again. I then got to drop myself off at my house. Oh what fun. I like driving, but sometimes it depends on the car I'm driving and how well I feel that I can adjust to it.  I can't wait until I get to go to the gym tomorrow since I didn't get to for the last three days (I wanted to, but I didn't want to get up that early). I'm "day-dreaming" of sleeping and I still have to take my contacts out. I love them and all, but they can be a pain to take out (especially this late). Riverfest starts tomorrow. Very fun. I hope someone calls me up so I actually can go down there and check it out. My sisters are having a spat. I hate it when they do that. Jill constantly bickers about how Joy's always cranky and makes things hard for herself. Joy.... I don't get to talk to her that much to see what she has a monopoly over when it comes to complaining. They're having a spat basically because Jill got into it with Joy about when her and Andy were going to start a family. Who cares?? It's their business. When it happens it happens, and that's when it'll happen. I heard that Jill supposedly singled Joy out in front of everyone, but I think I missed it because I was working on my art. Homework is always a good excuse to get out of things you really don't want to do. That day I wasn't really in the mood to strike up pointless conversations. I would have been happy to play with Sammy for 20 minutes and then go back to sleep. I want to redo my room. That's what happens when I watch the TLC channel. Today I got to see Ivan from While You Were Out in a bath tub. Nice visual. I'm still brainstorming what it is I want to do with it. It sucks when I tell someone what I think what I want to do with my room, and they judge it very harshly. I feel like telling them "And you're complaining because why??" They wouldn't have to live in it. Jeesh. If I wanted to tiger-stripe my room, why would it matter to anyone else that greatly?? I don't want to do that persay, but I think the people you don't want to rear heir head right into your life do, while the people that you wish you got more of you don't get. I think my mom's leaving to go out with my dad. Finally, a little while to do whatever in freedom from pointless questions or pointing fingers. A while alone to be myself, whatever that inquires. Mmmmm..... heaven.  "If you were going to die soon and had only one phone call you could make, who would you call and what would you say?

      Lately I've been having a few spats with my parents. I need some time away from them. Tomorrow I get to drive around 12:30, though I'm supposed to be picked up around 11:30 by Bree. I doubt they'll come on time since I've never gotten picked up on time for my driving lesson before. After having to go down Kory's driveway (which sucked!) I feel a bit more confident. It's a lot funner than I thought, despite the fact that I still have a lot to perfect. Joy came by today. I was glad to see her, but the only real reason she stayed for as long as she did was because of mom and dad. I guess talking to her little sister wasn't enough. People can be so aggravating at times. She did mention a few times that I shold get a cell phone sometime (for x-mas, maybe). She wants both of us to get Sprint cellphones so we can call each other without wasting minutes. I like that idea. Awkward how she's hinting that she may have to go soon one minute, and that she wants us both to get the same brand of cellphone to talk on the next. I feel sort of sad. I don't know why either. I can't tell what's yanking my chain. I just have this strange feeling in my chest, and it wont go away. I wonder why I have it. Is it because of something I said?? Is it something someone else said?? If only I knew. I can't put my finger on it. Megan might or might not be joining Premier Fitness. I hope she does, but I don't really want to feel like I'm competing with her. That's really the only horrible side I see to it. I don't feel like getting into constant debates with her about who's stronger. Or who eats more protein a day, and less carbs. I think she'd be great to talk to while I'm doing cardio, and I think she'd be a great spotter. I don't know. How many times a day do I say that?? Riverfest is coming up soon. Maybe the craft market will be very eclectic so I could get something for Megan for X-mas. Or maybe something for someone else. Very fun. I know who I want to go with, but the question is: "Is it mutual?" I could only hope so.

      I tried to post something on here last night, but I accidentally deleted it. I know, that was real smart. I have to admit that I definitely have my dumb moments at times. I drove for the first time yesterday. It was interesting to get the hang of. I also had to drive today, and it went much better than yesterday. I was incredibly shocked yesterday when Jesse called me. I wasn't expecting that at all. He surprises me like that sometimes. I like it when he does though. The usual "I respect, admire, and feel like grinning for eternity when I see him" doesn't quite cover every single thing I could say about him. There's so much that I do want to say about him, but I don't trust myself enough to spill that. Megan knows, she always has. I wish I could say it, but I don't think I can (especially through the net). I've known him for a while, but I know that there's still a world of him that I've never seen. There are some things I wish I could tell him, but I don't know if I can. He means a lot to me. I once asked him who he wanted to go to prom with, and other than his usual 2 crushes he mentioned going with a friend. When I asked who he said my name and then asked who I'd want to go with my junior year. I mentioned 2 guys in my grade that I once sort of had a thing for. I don't think I like them that way anymore though. I was really shocked when he said my name, I think my jaw dropped. I know I should have mentioned his name, but I was still too shy about it. Out of everyone in Wisconsin and Minnesota I think I'd want to go with him the most. I really hate how secluded I can make myself seem at times.  He went camping this weekend, and I miss him. I hope he has fun. It's strange that putting things into words ruin exactly what you want to say. It breaks off your perception of how someone will react as opposed to how they really do. I think that's enough of spilling my thoughts for right now.  "The most important things are the hardest to say, because words diminish them."   ~Stephen King~

      I passed my permit test today. I got none wrong, very shocking. The person I most wanted to run and tell I didn't dare bring myself to. I wanted to tell Joy. I've had my share of encountering her bad side in the past. I talked to Jill today though, and that was great. Jill told me that Jeffy said that Joy wasn't allowed to talk to Jill anymore because of Andy. I don't know Andy that well, so I can't really say that much about him. The fact that I don't know him all that well is quite disturbing to me. My sister married him and yet I only see him about every 2 months or more. Joy's usually grumpy whenever I do talk to her over the phone, so I've figured out to try to restrain from ever calling her though I know that's not what I really want. Everyone these days seem so unreachable. Maybe it's a figment of my imagination. I wish someone could crack into my head (not literally), to figure out what I was thinking. There are so many things I wish I could type write now, but I just can't say them. I wish I could "shrink" myself to the point where I give in to talking about what I want or what I feel. I can't always though, even on here. I wish I could even talk about who I want, but for all I know he could read this at any time. So many daydreams, and such a short life to even try to live them. I start driving tomorrow. I didn't really get a chance to today because my mom's leery of night driving, and we ran into Jeffy as soon as we came out of city hall. So Jeffy and I stopped by the house and then went to the gym while my mom had a few errands to run. My brother's the best, and I never thought I'd ever say that but it's true. Out of everyone in my family, he's not looney or an ignoramous. It seems like most people these days are ignorant. That probably explains exactly what I'm feeling right now. I sort of feel like finding someone to go sip frappacinos with, or to cuddle next to during a scary movie. Sometimes it's just the small things that count. The slightest things can go a long way. This sucks, I know who I want. I sort of doubt it's going to happen though at times it seems like it could. I've known him for a while, and Megan thinks that he doesn't know how I feel about him. So much for telepathy. If only, if only.....    "Within you I lose myself... Without you I find myself Wanting to be lost again." ~Unknown~

      Yep, I really am nervous about tomorrow. I usually try to be as calm as I can. I try to stay "balanced," but I really hope I pass my permit test. I've been studying off and on, but I haven't been at it that hardcore. I wonder if most mimes are mutes. I've thought about what a mime would be like on prosaic after having a larynx transplant. Twould be very funny. Unfortunately, I'll probably never witness it in my life. How many sell outs are there in the world?? I never want to become one. Money can be a horrible thing, if you allow it to rule mosts aspects of your life. The highest result of education is tolerance, and I seriously wonder how tolerant I am. I would never write a book that I'd never want to read, so why do most people do things soley for money?? I remember someone saying that everyone on this earth needs a shrink. Do shrinks need a shrink, or can they shrink themselves?? Leave it to me to ask the strangest questions. The weird thing is I actually try to find the answers. It's official, cold showers are the best thing ever after a long day. Water can wash away many things, especially when it's too the point where you can't think of much of anything else but it's temp. My hands are going to smell like soap and lotion for a long time. 2 guesses why. Back to my anxiety. I was going to ask Jesse for help with it yesterday, but I wasn't sure if I felt like I could go to him for help with it. Yeah I know, some days go by and I'm a wuss. He's already gone through it, and would probably stress how only an idiot could not pass. Some guy in driver's ed. named Scott went to Winona and took it. He passed. It was computerized, lucky. I don't mind taking a test on the computer, but I get a lot more tense with paper tests though that's standard. Now I have no clue why I'm even caring about computerized versus standard testing. Truth be told, it probably doesn't matter. I've got to study. "Somebody save me." (Remy Zero).  "I dropped a tear in the ocean.

      I'm listening to "Ruthless" by Something Corporate, and I'm getting lost in it's words. They seem to sink into my head and quickly fade away. I know that I'm not supposed to get too attached to the gym, but I'm really starting to love that place. It's full of great people, and I can go there to just get away from things at home. It's nearly heaven. I did a lot of circuit training today, and I loved it. I put in about 70 minutes of cardio (40 on the bike, 30 on the treadmill). Jeffy said it shouldn't feel like home. It doesn't really, but what can I say other than I'm hooked?? I really can't wait until I can do more circuit training tomorrow. I'm starting to see some improvements. Most of it's a mind thing, like I feel that I'm stronger than I thought I was. I saw a guy there today that looked really familiar. I doubt he was even 18, but I have to admit that he was cute. There's one guy I know that I don't think I'll ever really get over. Megan's known for a long time that I like him, but I would never really admit it. It sort of kills me that I don't think I really have a chance with him. It's complicated, and he's really complicated (i.m.o.). I know he doesn't want me to take my trip to Yale next summer. I want to go and I both don't want to. I think it would be a great opportunity for me, and that it would ensure me a good future and a great education. Like anyone, I do have my doubts. "What's enough love?? A little more than anyone ever gets." I'll never forget that quote, and the fact that it applies to my life all the time. I day dream all the time of getting on a plane with "someone special" and taking off for a week in Paris (or other) parentless and careless. That would really be heaven right there. I think I'm both looking for a good time, and for something serious. I wonder if I'll ever find it.

      Sometimes when you stop to actually think about one of those mind-lingering things in your head, you realize how strange it really is. I couldn't tell you how many times I hear a word and then think of how weird it is because of it's meaning or the way it sounds. Why are things the way they are anyway?? I doubt that would actually ever have an answer that isn't fabricated with narcissism. I got to talk to Jill for a little while today. She wants to make a costume for Sammy for Halloween. It's of the octopus from the wiggles. I tried to find one on the net, but I could only find 2 characters from that show. I know that Chris hates the wiggles, but I think it's a good show for little kids. I hope Sammy always stays as pure of heart as he is now, because once you grow up I think your morals go all down hill from there. Maybe I'm wrong, it wouldn't be a first. It's funny how one of the things that keeps me sane is music. I think my song from when I'm really down is "Hello Again" by the Lost Prophets.   I hardly believed my eyes whenever I went into my room today. I could actually see the floor!! I cleaned my room up a little last night, so that was fun, I guess.  Today I'm in an odd mood, it's like a mix of cuddliness and of fragileness. I wonder how materialistic the world is. I wonder how materialistic I am, and how I will be in future years. I know certain days I can be really vain, and others I'm completely careless. Would the world be better off without money?? Would it be better without the constant desire for something or other?? I could only imagine how many things a person could want in a lifetime. It's a tragedy not to get it, but it's also just as bad to actually get it. I know that for a few people, by getting what they want they desire it less. "As a rule, man's a fool. When it's hot he wants it cool. When it's cool he wants it hot, always wanting what is not." Are all people insatiable?? Am I? I must be in one of my "philosophical" moods. My mind is wandering, I just hope it doesn't get caught anywhere that it will be tangled in for days. My permit test is coming up soon. I get really tense thinking about it because I know it's supposed to be easy, but what if it's not?? What if people only said it was easy because they went through it years ago and can't really remember all the details of going through it? People today, there's something wrong there at times.

      One of the bad things about typing instead of writing with a pen/pencil is that you get so many typos. I hate using spell check with my posts so I get that a lot. When it does happen, I'm completely tuned out so I don't catch it. Typos flat out suck. Do horoscopes ever tell the truth?? I know there are so many things in life that effect who we are, but is our astrological sign among them. How many siblings we have, and the order in which we were born is one of them. Eye color, birthmarks, etc... I don't know if I have any birthmarks. If reincarnation does exist, I will in my next life. I would have a mark on the forearm of my left arm. I got that once from when I was working on something with a glue gun. That really hurt. Another I got on my left hand from when I was in 6th grade. I was in choir and somehow Erin F. and I had this crazy idea of sinking her nails into my hand to see if I would cry like a baby. I didn't, hehehe. That didn't feel like a walk in the park though. Actually, I think I might have a birthmark on my upper left arm. I'm still waiting for a scar to fade near my ankle on my left leg. I'm not sure how I got it, but I know it was near the time that I passed out in art class. I've only passed out twice in my life, and it's enough to never make me want to go through it again. The first time I was in a hospital. We were visiting my Uncle David who had been placed in the hospital because of some of the things that smoking causes. I guess that I just couldn't really take in the sight of seeing him hooked up to all those wires (some people think that it was the smell in the hospital that made me pass out, but I don't think that was it), and the next thing I knew was that I was seeing all black no matter how wide I would open my eyes or sure that they were open. A few moments later I was on the ground wondering what on earth had happened. I felt so embarassed because there were a lot of people hoovering over me to see if I was okay. When I looked over at David I felt so horrible because I didn't want all that attention when I knew that he should have probably been getting it instead of me because he was in a more serious condition.   But, is astrology accurate?? If it is, I'm a rarity among signs. I'm a taurus on the cusp of gemini. Many of the qualities of both signs fit with my personality. Sometimes I can be the most shy and secluded person, and then other times I'm really outgoing. Strange. Around most people I try to be pretty silent unless I really need to say something. That's just one example. Mmmm...... I'm really tired, and I should probably hit the sack before I fall asleep right here.

      I was bummed out tonight when I found out that the gym closes earlier than I thought it did on weekends. My dad won tickets to the speedway, so we ended up spending a few hours there. I called Megan today because she called me yesterday and I was sort of busy doing something so I didn't notice when the phone rang. She wanted to go downtown to figure out a few ways to "pimp her car out" (as she'd say) from what I heard today. I asked her if she'd like to go to the speedway tonight, and she said that she had to work tomorrow so maybe next week. I rarely ever go, but it's not that bad when I do go to the races. There are a few downsides, I will admit to that. I hate how many people within a few square yards of you that you can find smoking. I was both thrilled and sobbing when Steve Carlson got 2nd to Justin Derks in their "special-feature race." My dad once sponsered Carlson back around the time I was born. Being a Reget does have a few legacies. We usually lack tradition except for holidays (like the 4th of July, X-mas, and Thanksgiving). Soccer was something that I picked up from Jeffy and John. Racing and cars is something my dad has always been focused on before he reached my age. My mom's always been unpunctual. I hope I didn't get my family's alcohol craze. I really don't like dizziness. I can sometimes get motion sickness really easily, and when I do it really sucks,. I've been under a slight alcohol influence before, but I really hated it. I wonder how long I've been obsessed with music for.   I'm still wondering what I should do when my parents go to Iola. I wouldn't mind going over to Jill's or Joy's, but they probably have to work so I don't want to cause them any inconvenience. I could stay home. I'm not sure. I've been having a lot of day dreams lately. What can I say?? I'm a dreamer. What I dream is really random. Sometimes it's going on a vacation to Rome with John Cho or Drew Fuller. Other times it's about my future. I really should get my head unfogged.    "Dreams are illustrations from the book your soul is writing about you." ~Masrha Norman~

      I'm really really really really really really tired. I can't wait until I can go upstairs and just pass out. Hehehe. I was really surprised to hear about that building exploding today in LaX. Jeffy said he didn't know about it until he was at the gym. He called at around 9, and I was at least half asleep when i was talking to him then. I went in at around 11:30, did cardio, and got in some circuit training. I was on a time limit because of my eye appointment. Ever since Tuesday, I've really started to like taking cold showers. I'm thrilled that my contacts didn't take forever to put in and take out. At my appointment I picked up my new frames, and my contacts had to be ordered. I got a pair of sunglasses today, my mom said that you always lose them. I hope she's wrong because I really like mine.   There are just somethings you can never forget. I remember how much of a sucker I am when I share one of those "soul-shaking" looks with a guy. I can only remember 2 times that it's happened to me before. Once during a confirmation class a few months ago, and another time about 2 years ago at the boys and girl's club. It's really sexy when you actually have eye-contact with the person you're talking to. What actually happened when I had one of those earth shattering occurences is that we met eyes, and I was both anxious and regretful to look away. Of course, I kept my eyes locked on the subject in question. I'm clueless as to why I'm even ranting about this right now. Who know?? I really don't

      Today was pretty good. My abs ached so much!!! My quads and glutes were still really tense. I did about 50 minutes of cardio today, and then I again got to know some of the equipment a little better. I had to use a few ab machines today. That didn't feel the greatest afterward. Tomorrow, I'm unsure of what's going on. Jeffy usually goes in from 9-11 in the morning on Fridays. I was hoping to sleep in a bit, but I suppose I could probably go in then. Who knows.....tomorrow things will straighten out. Today my eye appointment was delayed until 3:15 p.m. tomorrow. Jeffy came to get me at about 4:30. I don't know when we left, but I showered at their house and then went out to dinner with my parents. Afterwards, my mom and I went to wal-mart. I was in the magazine department when a very drool-worthy guy walked past me, smiled, and said hi. I shyly said hi back..... I know, real smooth, jeeze I guess I'm lucky that my jaw didn't drop.   A very touchy subject came up today. The very dreaded topic of my father grew it's huge flapping wings and flew right into my forehead. Sometimes I can make a huge deal out of it, and other times I'll admit that I don't really care about it or think about it for a second. Uh-oh, I think my own ignorance is measuring up to his. I really hope that's not the case. I know that most days I would rather die than being like him. It's true that in some-ways I am my father's daughter, but I know that I could never be exactly like him. It would probably make me perish. I still remember when I was around 8 or 9 years old when I used to sleep out on the sofa on Friday nights, and my parents would come home late and end up fighting. Sometimes they would scream at each other, and I remembered crying whenever I heard my dad hitting my mom. Times have changed since then, but those thoughts still scare me. My dad's a bloody monster after he's had a few drinks (or more), except at weddings when that's the only place you could ever get a picture of him smiling (my parent's aren't too photo-happy). I've seen his actual ugly side for myself too. Right now I feel sort of careless ranting on about it. It's in the past, and I have to remember some of it for the sake of my future.

      I'm surprised that this slipped my mind before, but I got a call yesterday from JSA. I asked them if they could reserve my placement for next year.....and they were more than happy to. ::smiles:::  I went to the gym today (again). I put in about an hour and 10 minutes of cardio. Tom sort of showed me around the gym a bit more. Time just flew by, and I wasn't asking myself every 5 minutes if it was over yet. It took forever to get the contact in my right eye out tonight, and the left one came out after about 5 to 10 minutes. After that, I decided to take a cold shower. That felt really nice. I'm really glad that I get to sleep in tomorrow and Friday. No driver's ed., at least not until Wednesday & Thursday. I think I'm going to spend most of my weekend studying for my permit test. No, I haven't gone over it about 5 times, but my mind's been many places lately. I applied at the Portrait Studio at Sears. I think I did that just yesterday. I really want to get a job this summer, but I know then that my schedule may really be crammed. I have an eye appointment tomorrow. Blah...... I really wish that I didn't, but I guess I can't really change it. Maybe I can order my contacts then. I haven't lost my "free-trial" pair yet, so that's a good sign. I think I'm going to get some sleep. Today was long, who knows what tomorrow will be like??  "It's so good to be alive in such a hazardous world."  ~Melee~

      So I started at the gym yesterday. I put in about an hour of cardio (or a little more). I alternated from the elliptical machines, to the treadmills, to the elliptical machines again, and then to the bikes. We then went back around 4:30. I got on a treadmill for a bit to get a warm up for my class. Then I went back to the studio and waited for Lindsay. 4 or 5 other people showed up, all of which were girls. The class it's self was sort of challenging. I'm not saying that I've never done walking lunges before (because I have and I do not like them), but 6 sets seemed like a lot. The class was to target glutes and abs. My abs don't feel nearly as bad as my glutes and quads feel today. I think someone ran over them when I went to sleep last night. Overall, I liked going to Premier Fitness yesterday. I'm not sure what's going on today though.   I think I found a song that's my own mental health fix. It's called "Time and Time Again," by Chronic Future. I can't find the lyrics for it though. That part sort of sucks, but it's a good song. I've got to get the Spiderman 2 soundtrack. The first Spiderman soundtrack was great. Usually I'm not a real hardcore Spiderman fan, but the movie looks great and I bet the soundtrack will be phenonmenal. I listened to a song off of it by Dashboard Confessional. I liked it. Dashboard Confessional is okay. Some of their songs I love, other's a I can't stand. I know that by the end of their current cd, it sounded like the whole band was half asleep.   I'm starting to think that I'm a partial du-mass. I keep thinking back to a special occasion about a little more than a year ago. All I can say is that a guy about 7 years older than me sort of hit on me. God, why did I just sit there like I had no idea what was going on?? And of course, nothing happened. Maybe something would have if he wouldn't have been drunk, and if I would have been under a slight influence there also. Ugh.... if only time could be reversed somewhere.

      "Razors pain you; Rivers are damp. Acids stain you; And drugs cause cramp. Gun's aren't lawful; Nooses give. Gas smells awful; You might as well live!"  ~Dororthy Parker~  Mika once choose to name that "Semi-sweet Suicide" in espanol class once. I know that it's a message to forget about whatever twisted idea in your head about pulling that, and that it tells you that disappearing from the face of the earth spiritually isn't a good idea. It covers most of the key points of how one can commit suicide. Now I have the worst expression on my face because I know that there are people out there that do, and I know that I probably can't stop them. Humanity is joy, and it is suffering. You can't have one without the other. As said before, "The more sorrow one encounters, the more joy one can contain." I wonder what my capacity for happiness is. Can you ever fully reach maximum capacity for happiness?? Maybe I should try. I wonder if I would have to bare the burden of taking more sorrow then. I hope that wouldn't be the case. Speaking of happiness, I think my eyes took a slight direction in that area when I was taking my contacts out tonight. They took less time (very good sign, but it still kind of took a while), and my eyes didn't feel completely horrible fifteen minutes later after they were out. I still kind of got dizzy. I think the reason for that now is because I have different prescriptions when I switch on and off. I want to be happy in my life, how much will that cost me??

      "So why should I take your hand when you can't promise happy endings?"  "It's starting to get old That story that untold Reflect before we walk into What we already know Won't be so easy Looking back at high school drama Didn't try to fix what we thought were problems Someone's writing empty letters Is there no other way?  Staring at your reflection every day Can make or break my heart away When you won't listen to what's hard for me to say Those tear stained eyes can make me feel so sad And once again we're further away from what we never had  So why should I take your hand when you can't promise happy endings? Just run away with so much left to share It's just not enough When we're so much more than friends We're much too young to throw away our cares  There's no sense in regretting what's been said in our yesterdays We're getting backwards double  We can look ahead And I would walk so much further just to know what I'm doing here And there's no end to what I'd give to know just what you meant when you said How can I feel alive when we can't help but break our backs just to survive? Is this another time we can't control our lives?

      Last night around 10:00, Jeffy called. At the time I was reading my driving manual, and listening to music. I picked up the phone, but I guess my mom got to it first. They talked for a while. Then it was my turn. I found out that tomorrow is going to be the day that I start at the gym. This should be different, but a fun kind of different. I'm both slightly nervous about it, and sort of anxious to start. I'm pretty sure that I'm going to take a few classes there..... including: pilates, kick-boxing (yeah!!), and maybe a few ab sculpting or glute sculpting classes. I'll probably try to fit in at least a half an hour of cardio in, and a half hour of strength training. I hope to alternate days of abs, legs/glutes, and arms. I hope this works. I think I'm going to be spending weekday afternoon's there. Very fun.   My mom finally decided to pick up an application at the Onalaska Care Center today before her shrink appointment with Ellen. My mom also has an appointment with Claudia on Wednesday. I heard that my dad is supposed to be coming with her to pay Ellen a visit. Very strange.   I again have my contacts in. I really seem to be adjusting to them. The first time I ever tried to put them in by myself with out help was horroriffic. We were at Shopko (southside), and I couldn't put them in to save my life. Rick got them in, surpisingly after about 20 tries with my right eye and 2 with my left. I still have some slight difficulties getting them out. I wonder, I can put things into my eye, but can barely take them out?? Oh well, I guess it sometimes takes time to get used to things. The things worth doing in life are worth doing right, or so they say.

      It sounds like my mom wants to go to school to be a medical assistant. Part of me is grinning, and another part is weeping. I guess it's the usual ying-yang concept. On one hand, it will allow me more time to slink into my usual daze of putting cd's in the dvd player in the living room and just cranking the volume, or doing what ever else. On another hand, it's probably going to cost a lot. Again, she slept for a while today. I'm starting to think that my parent's are sort of irresponsible. Some one save me.   I'm starting to miss some people from school, like Ashley K., Chelsey M., Stephanie, and Jesse. I get very easily confused about Jesse though. He's confusing, I'm confusing, good god who isn't?? I've known him for a while, and there's both a lot that I know about him and other things I have no idea about. We sort of have similiar tastes in music, except he's more punkish and I'm just into whatever. Yep, I'll admit it that I love bands that are willing to scream at the top of their lungs sometimes. It's expression, you really can't put a damper on it. I'm all about self-expression. Though, sometimes I do have trouble expressing myself. Half the time when I'm around Jesse, I try to pull words out of thin air only to find that I'm making an arse out of myself. I really like spending time with him though.    I'm debating whether or not I should put my contacts in, or take a day off from them. I probably should because the more I wear them, the more I'll adjust to them, but I guess a slight break never killed anyone (depending upon the circumstances). I think I'll just leave it till tomorrow. I wish Jeffy'd get back to me on what exactly is happening with the whole gym membership thing. I think it'd be fun, endorphin highs make me bounce off the walls and leave me tired about a half an hour later. That's the best part.

      I still remember Memorial day of this year. I was still working on my own paper mache "monster" (or as Miss O. would say "screamer"). I was surprised to see that Jill hadn't cracked the wine open, but she had brought some Jack Daniels and Smirnoff. What is with  my family and their happy attitude towards alcohol? I guess that Joy had brought me a birthday present, which was a photo album that had a few pictures from her wedding in it, a necklace with a blue stone in it that matches my eyes, and another fun thing from her wedding that I can't come up with a name for right now. The card fit perfectly though. In it, she mentioned how she knows that we don't see each other that much but she really hoped that we could spend some time together over the summer. I hope it happens, but somewhere I sort of doubt that it will. I remember how much fun we always had when I was younger. I remember going to the movies with her, and then after we'd almost always would go and get frozen yogurt with gummy bears. We sometimes went to the pool, or after she moved out she would sometimes invite me to stay over at her apartment. What ever happened anyways?? Where did things just get put on pause?? I know this summer that she's teaching summer school at West Salem. I think she's still at the hospital as a dietary assistant, and she's supposed to be in a wedding soon. The couple who's tying the knot would be Matt and X-tina (Christina). Matt's Andy's brother and Joy's brother in law. When Joy had her wedding, we didn't get the greatest impressions from Christina; hence, the name X-tina came up. Joy said that she'd be free in August. I hope she is, and I hope that I am sometime. Last year when I was staying with Joy and Jill during my parent's trip to Iola, they decided to get together for an afternoon and go up to Ashley Furniture. We had an interesting talk. Somewhere, Jill mentioned that she felt like she never saw Joy anymore. A tense moment came after that. Joy mentioned that she felt the same way, and how she sometimes starts crying that she misses us and how being married is very demanding. I really didn't know what to say after that. I hope I wasn't just given false hope when I read that card. It's funny how easily a person can be given false hope.

      I just took my contacts out. It doesn't bother me all that much putting them in (usually), but taking them out sucks. I got a little dizzy after they were finally out, but I don't know why. They say everyone has a different method of putting them in and taking them out. Why did I adopt my mom's method from when she had contacts?? She uses the "aching back" method, which is leaning over the sink trying to put them in or take them out.   Right now I'm listening to the Lost Prophets. It's been a while since I've lstened to them, so I'm happy. My mom slept most of today, which is most definitely not a good sign. I tried to call Jill to get an earful of her usual "well thought-out" insight. She wasn't home, oh well. I think I need some space from my mom. I'm really starting to hate how she's just always there. I'm not saying that I don't ever want to be around her, it's just being around someone for too many hours a day can be disturbing.   Either today or yesterday was the one year anniversary of the day hell broke loose. I can't say exactly what happened, because it's just that personal. On some level, I don't feel like I'm that ready to let much of anyone know about it. I told a few people, but I felt like I could really trust them. Let's just say that one year from around this time of year, my beliefs were slightly changed. I don't even know if I believe in religion anymore. Now when I think about it, it just seems like some strange conception in the mind, or a way to control people. Maybe I'll believe in something again sometime, or maybe I wont. I wouldn't say I'm an athiest, because I don't really like labels. Also, I guess athiesm it's self is kind of a religion, and that's exactly what I'm unsure about. Chelsey's an athiest. Before I was sort of a pantheist and a polytheist. Monotheism seems kind of controlling. I bet some people would wonder what the hell I'm talking about, somedays I wonder what I'm even griping about. I'm an odd one, but I guess that's why I'm "special." Lol......

      "I close my eyes when I get too sad. I think thoughts that I know are bad. Close my eyes and I count to ten, Hope it's over when I open them.  I want the things that I had before, Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door. I wish I could count to ten, Make everything be wonderful again.  Hope my mom and I hope my dad, Will figure out why they get so mad. Hear them scream, I hear them fight. They say bad words that make me wanna cry.  Close my eyes when I go to bed, And I dream of angels who make me smile. I feel better when I hear them say, Everything will be wonderful someday.  Promises mean everything when you're little, And the world's so big. I just don't understand how, You can smile with all those tears in your eyes. Tell me everything is wonderful now.  Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now.  I go to school and I run and play. I tell the kids that it's all okay. I laugh aloud so my friends won't know, When the bell rings I just don't wanna go home.  Go to my room and I close my eyes, I make believe that I have a new life. I don't believe you when you say, Everything will be wonderful someday.  Promises mean everything when you're little, And the world is so big. I just don't understand how, You can smile with all those tears in your eyes, When you tell me everything is wonderful now.  No. No, I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now. No. No, I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now.  I don't wanna hear you say, That I will understand someday. No, no, no, no. I don't wanna hear you say, You both have grown in a different way. No, no, no, no. I don't wanna meet your friends, And I don't wanna start over again. I just want my life to be the same, Just like it used to be. Some days I hate everything. I hate everything, Everyone and everything. Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now...  I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now."  ~Everclear~

      It's strange what one dreams. It's even more puzzling how day-dreams can differ from your subconscious dreams. Somedays I can't describe how much I would love to take off for the west coast as soon as I could. I'd get a very nice house  next to the ocean with a balcony from my bedroom so that I could go out and listen to the waves whenever I couldn't sleep. The house it'self would be huge, and I'd hope to never actually have to clean it.   "There's two tragedies in life. One is not getting what you want. The other is getting it."  If the above quote is actually true, does that mean that no one will ever really be happy?? There's so many dreams you have in this life, and I really want them not to be only dreams. I guess the dream I just mentioned before seems so appealing because sometimes I just feel like I need to get away for a while. Sometimes I can only bend so much before I break, and yet other times I feel completely fine. Sure, I laugh when ever I hear Flogging Molly (which I think is an Irish band that makes me grin like an oxi-moron). Will I ever actually get to follow any of my dreams.....I wonder.   I finally got my contacts in today without any help. It took a long time, and a lot of tolerance. It was tricky to get them in, the lenses are very full. They're eye-openers, I can say that much. Once I did get both of them in, they were very comfy except I was still adjusting to the one in my left eye. After a while it just seems like they're not really in, even though you know they are because you can see so well. The horrific part for me was getting them out. Ugghh, that part's going to take a while to get used to.  I think I know a place that I would love to work at. I think I would really enjoy working in the portrait studio at Sears. I've been checking job opportunities around here, and I saw somewhere that they were looking to hire someone. It's kind of an all-around job. You have to actually take the photographs, and try to make everyone smile. You have to work the cash register, phone, etc... It covers a lot, but I think that it would be fun. I was starting to get interested in photography, so maybe this would be great for me. I also heard that Jeffy was wondering if I'd be interested in a membership at Premier Fitness. I am, especially since he told me that they offer many classes. I would definitely love to take a kickboxing class, and possibly a pilates class. That would probably take me about 2-4 hours a day at least in the gym. I would definitely want to do a whole lot of cardio there, and maybe some strength training. Maybe it would create some more time for Jeffy and I to spend more time together even though it would probably be pretty silent time because usually when you're in a gym you really have to focus or it might be about useless.  Now to talk about this mystery guy. There's just certain things about him that's so drawing. Like the way he runs his hands through his hair (almost like Hunter Niall, lol). I do have to admit that I feel like an idiot more than half the time I'm around him (since I really don't know the right words to say all the time). Summer vacation's here already, and I already miss him. I don't get why I'm so freaking sensitive. I feel sad over just seeing a dead birdie or squirrel in the road (or bunny, the dead bunnies really get to me since I love to use the term "bunny-hugger"). I guess to make a long story short, I'm not just sensitive but shy (depending on the person), and not at all eloquent.

      Sometimes it just seems like everything is messed up for some reason. I feel like that sometimes. Then, I just need something to uncloud my head. My mom got fired yesterday. My dad's pretty angry with the corporation. I don't blame him, my mom's ex-employer's were a bunch of frauds anyway. They find ways to single out people and fire them. My dad decided to pull up a few records on my mom's time as a nurse's aide to prove that the whole thing is the equivalent to one stupid scandal. I know my mom doesn't want to go back to work there, so I've been trying to help her find a new job. I think that she wants to work in a hospital. She had me pull up Gundersen Lutheran and Franciscan Skemp's sites to find any job openings they may have. Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of hospitals since I fainted in one when visiting my uncle (who's now unfortunately deceased). My Uncle David had a brain tumor at the time that he got from smoking. I felt really bad for David though, because his wife (the very evil Lynn) had divorced him (she's a gold-digger, evil!). He soon after found out that he had many bodily problems, and he tried to start getting control of his life again. My Aunt Elaine had died a year ago last fall, and David was instructed not to go to the funeral. He wanted to go though, but how he got there was very sad. He died. My dad was broken. I remember crying on our way over to the wake for Elaine. I never really knew her that well, but it was enough to sadden me. Why do people live to die? I wish I could wipe the thought that we're all going to die some day from my mind.  I have no idea what's bound to happen. The fact that I have no idea is upsetting. What if my mom doesn't get a job anytime soon and her depression grows?? What if she decides to sleep even more, or what if she decides to suppress her thoughts by becoming an acoholic?? That's too freaking disturbing. I'm trying to help her find a job, but nothing's ever guaranteed and many people are in a bind these days.   My mom decided to make a last minute appointment for me today to get my eyes checked. It turns out that I may very well be getting contacts. It took me forever to get the lenses into my eyes. I usually have pretty fast reflexes about half the time (unless I'm practically half awake). My reflexes definitely didn't help at all. Everytime I tried to focus on something else while I tried or Rick tried getting the thing into my eye, it kept failing me. It finally worked after about 40-50 minutes of work on my right eye. It then took 2 tries to get the contact into my left eye. I really hope that I can adjust to it. I found out something new tonight. I found out that Brandon has a job at Quillin's. I never knew that before. He was in my design first semester last school year. He seems pretty nice, I guess. I'm tired, and I should probably read a bit more of my guide to driving in Minnesota. I vowed to myself that I'd read 10 pages of it a night. It's working so far, but I hope that I can stay awake long enough to read it for that long tonight.

      Yesterday, we went to Jill's house. My mom wanted to get her hair cut, and my sister's licensed in that department. I love going out there. It's a few miles outside Trempaleau. Jill and Chris' house is really great. I got to play with Sammy for a while. When I'm around Sammy (a.k.a. "Linus" because of his blanket obsession, so adorable), it seems like I'm a different person. I feel like you couldn't wipe the grin off my face no matter what. What can I say other than I love my nephew. I probably say that too much, but it's completely true. Some people I have a type of love/hate relationship with, but I can never say that I have gotten mad at him, ever. He's so pure of heart and innocent. I love his smile which I usually get to see whenever I do play with him. I just got the Warped Tour 2004 Compilation. It's really good, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves rock. There's 52 songs on it by many different bands. I'm loving it.   My mom got a call today from her job. She's supposed to go in and talk to the administrator and the D.O.N. She thinks that she's about to get the boot. I hope that's not the case. My dad's going with her even though he has a hearing sometime today with the city council of  La Crosse. She told him that she didn't want him to speak up for her, but I know telling him that was completely useless. When something bothers my dad, he doesn't usually keep you guessing about it. He speaks his mind very freely. Sometimes too freely. She says everything's going to be alright, but I know that she's worried on some level. I have to admit that it is troubling, but part of it just doesn't really stick to my thoughts so I guess that I'm not going to try to glue it. Despite this news, I actually feel like everything's great. Strange, I know, but I'm happy right now. I don't want to spoil it. ::grin:::  I think I'm in love, or denial. Sometimes the two seem nearly interchangable. It's not like me to actually spoil the secret by saying who I feel so strongly about, so I guess I'm not quite ready to spill who it is yet. I probably am in denial. What is love anyway?? I know the feeling of it, but how do you define it exactly?? Can you even give it a perfect definition to fit it?

      While I do think 3 hour classes are way too long, I was really surprised when it went by faster than I thought it would. Everytime I glanced up at the clock, it seemed that 5 minutes or more had passed each time. I'm now in love with my Story of the Year cd. It's the best! Some of my favorite songs other than "Anthem of Our Dying Day" including: Sidewalks, Swallow the Knife, Until the Day I Die (very sweet song), and In the Shadows. I think a lot of bands like to use the title "In the Shadows." The Rasmus' first debut song was titled that exactly.  I guess we're getting a different keyboard. I hooked up the old one, but then I had to adjust the cord and hold it there to make it work so I can see why we needed a new one. Finally, I then went and got the tape. It's amazing what all you can do with masking tape (other than using it to tape someone's mouth shut, but I think duct or electrical tape works better then). One flaw with computers would be all the typos they produce. Blah... I'm still waiting for an answer back from Jen Moyle. It's taking a long time. I got back to her on Sunday from 2 e-mails she sent me on Friday about my future plans for next summer. I asked her if she could reserve my placement for then, so I hope to get an answer back soon. On Friday, I found something interesting for me in the mail. I guess it was called "Who's who in America: for students." It probably wasn't that exact wording, but close. I sent in my bibliography for it. It seemed similiar to the award I got from the United States Achievement Academy for my interests in art (where I applied for a scholarship in). I don't think you can get too early of a start on your future. That's probably why I actually go along with some of the honors I'm offered. That and I'm unsure that if I don't get a whole lot of scholarships that I might not be going to college. My parents are still in a slight hole because of expenses for pills and visits to the shrink. So.... if I don't find my own way into college, it's possible that I may not be able to go (well, I could but it would take me a long time). It's strange how some people can be so materialistic compared to the things that really matter. A 55" television for example is something you don't need in order to live. A college education for me seems like something I need though. I'd feel like I'd have let myself down if I didn't go. I want a great future, point blank. I know I want to write sometime, and I still don't know what else I want to do. People tell me I have a great future in head of me, but what if they're wrong? I can't be so full of myself to automatically assume that I'm for sure going to get there. What to do?

      As you can probably tell by now....we now have a different computer. To go with this computer, my dad decided to get a new mouse and keyboard to go with it. There's one problem with the keyboard. The space key is shot to practically nothing. I now have to copy and paste from the character map to use spacing. I wonder if I'm jinxed or if my dad is. Sometimes I question why I even call him my father. Biologically he is, but he's never really been there for me except for one day of the week which would be Sunday. I don't think he realizes how much his ignorance wounds me. It's true that if I ever really needed to talk to I could just call the shop or his cell. This is a really tense subject. Just thinking about it sometimes makes me uneasy. Every time I do talk to him I have to take his criticism,listen to my parents talk about the aftermath of the accident,or just sit there in silence and stare out a window or something in the background. I hate it when he makes me feel like a thoughtless 3-year old. He's very good at that. I can't take this spacing method any longer. Tomorrow has got to be better than today.

      I guess my worrying about driver's ed was pretty much for nothing. Now I'm just amazed that sitting in that room for 3 hours today didn't make me just break. That was way too long. After I got back I went back to sleep for about an hour and a half. I think I needed that. I wonder what's in a wonder ball. Umffff...... who doesn't?? I wonder about too many things. I probably wouldn't be me if I all of a sudden just stopped wondering. Strange how that works. I'm still wondering whether or not I want anyone to know about my own blog. I'm probably going to post a lot of personal things on here, and sometimes I'm unsure if I'm ready for anyone to know about them. Someone blow my head out of the water. I got stuck sitting next to John Nehls today in driver's ed. I know officially think that he complains way too much. There were about 4 or 5 people in there that I've never before seen... I still wonder why someone from Aquinas would come to LaCrescent to take classes. Strange, unless they lived here which you think they'd go to this school (unless they were Joy who went to Aquinas).   "I wonder how bad boys can be, and I wonder when I will find my good boy." Remind me that I know I'll find my soul mate when they actually call me back. I hate to say it, but what the hell is it with guys and phones?? I swear, that deal is enough to drive me mad. When they don't call you back it's like the same as blowing someone off. As Chelsey says..... Guys suck! I wonder if soul mates really do exist. That would be too perfect. I heard that if reincarnation really does exist, everyone you know now would be a soul mate (or "soul friend") to you in the future. I don't think that's exactly what I'm thinking of. When I think soul mate, I think about another half to my soul and not just an acquinatance from a past life. But really, I wonder if they do exist. Am I wasting my time on wishful thinking?? Probably, I think I do that enough lately. I love quoting "Too Far Gone" by the All American Rejects.  "Wishful thinking, patience sinking. Bliss is far away. North is calling, now I'm falling. At your feet please stay. Now we're too far gone. Hope is such a waste. Every breath you take gives me  the burden's bitter taste. You promised that you'd stay Say you want to go Your lips provide a shelter for the things that I don't know. Please speak slowly, My heart it learning. Teach me heartache, Stop this burning, now."  It's better than 267 Stupid Pick Up Lines (well,it is in my opinion).

      Driver's ed. starts tomorrow. I don't know if I should be half jumping up and down screaming the phrase "Smurf you, you smurfing smurf," (which has been stuck in my head all day now thanks to coming across Mika's "I Am" poem)or if I should feel very nervous about it. For me... I guess new experiences kind of make me anxious because I have no idea what to expect. I found something "interesting" out yesterday. My mom told me that my dad deciding upon something. He told her that I'm supposedly going to be learning how to drive on an 83' oldsmobile cabarlet convertible. It's a stick! Someone save me or get me a noose. I just don't get it..... I've mentioned the fact that you can't really drive convertibles in the winter (and I've gotten the third degree of "What did I just get done saying?" from him).... so now he's giving me a summer car with low safety ratings? Well, I guess if he sells it like my mom thinks he's going to.... my worries will have been for nothing. Jill thinks I should get Jeffy's ZX2 after I get my liscense. Good god, why can't I just tell someone what I'd like and leave it at that?? Why am I even worrying about something so incredibly dumb right now?? I think I'm going to post a song. HHmmm..... Acoustic # 3 by the Goo Goo Dolls:  "They painted up your secrets With the lies they told to you. And the least they ever gave you Was the most you ever knew. And I wonder where these dreams go When the world gets in your way. What's the point in all this screaming? No one's listening anyway. Your voice is small and fading And you hide in here alone. And your mother loves your father 'Cause she's got nowhere to go. And she wonders where these dreams go When the world got in her way. What's the point in ever trying? Nothing's changing anyway. They press their lips against you And you love the lies they say. And I tried so hard to reach you But you're falling anyway. And you know I see right through you When the world gets in your way. What's the point in all this screaming? You're not listening anyway."  I have no idea why I love that song so much (I could probably say that about every other song I like also), but I do. It's on my own personal soundtrack which I was saddened to know that Jesse practically thought it sucked. What on earth is with that boy anyway?? Guys suck. Most days I'm already in my zany world of confusion, and yet I get blown away even more so. Why is it that every single relationship I have with any relative I have is completely uumm.... well, muy horrible?? I seriously think that my dad only had his 5 children to abandon them, and they say he got that from his dad. My mom's depressed and on an anti-depressant that I truly want to compare to prozac in strength per dose some day. Jill I was never really close to since we're 14 years apart, so I was around 8 or 9 by the time she got married (I think). I used to be really close to Joy, but then she got her own life and got very distant. John, aahh.... I don't know. Jeffy..... I think we drived each other nuts after living together for 14 years. Jeffy and I are okay though. We talk at least 3 times a week (usually), and he seems to be doing okay lately (despite his break up with his g/f of one year). Lastly there's me. There's both too much and too little to say there. I guess the reason why I love that song so much is because it's made me want to hold on to my dreams even more so. I don't want to regret. I've made enough of those in my life already, and I just want tolive a great life and say to everyone right now "Smurf you, you smurfing smurf!"

      I am a quiet girl who loves art. I wonder where I go from here. I hear blissful music that drowns out everything else in my mind. I see the sky, and I wonder how it will change after 15 years of air pollution. I want to know my life's path. I am a quiet girl who loves art.  I pretend that it's not time to get up in the morning when my alarm clock goes off. I feel that people these days lack respect for nature. I touch a pencil thinking about what it is I am to draw or write. I worry that I will never really find myself. I cry when someone close to me dies or when I'm reminded of bad memories. I am a quiet girl who loves art.  I understand that life's not perfect, even though I wish that it were. I say, "Maybe you have the right answers, but the wrong questions." I dream that I am five years old, and I'm still able to play with my older brothers and sisters. I try to talk, but I only find that no one's actually listening. I hope to do something great with my life. I am a quiet girl who loves art.  (The truly scary thing is that I meant every word of that which I used as my "I Am" poem, strange huh?)

      I guess my own blog on here is for what ever "pointless" rantings come to mind. People find different ways to vent, and I guess I just found another for me. For anyone who comes to this site and doesn't know me, that's fine, whatever, leave if you want. I guess some basic things about myself are that I am 100% obsessed with music. Yay! I just got Page Avenue by Story of the Year. I'm excited. I'm the youngest of 5 children which sucks! At least when you're the oldest you get to watch everyone else grow up and actually understand it (where if you're the youngest, you don't understand that you're not going to be a short little "munchkin" forever!) My favorite color's green. My favorite movies include: the HP and LOTR series, Bend It Like Beckham, 10 Things I Hate About You, and Out Cold. I guess among my rantings on this site, I'll also be posting poetry occasionally, favorite lyrics, quotes, and dumb things that pop into my head. Enjoy!

      Today's been horrible. It started to become a horrorific tragedy when Jeffy came to pick me up. I'm so angry at him right now. He started talking about the arbitraion. I'm so sick of it, and I'm not even half way involved with it. Ugh.... I mentioned how they moved it to a day that I may have school on. and I didn't really like that. He thought I was being stupid because I value being educated. If it was later on in the month, that would be fine. I don't really want to leave a bad impression with my new teachers that I enjoy blowing school off. The first days in my opinion are very important because you're just becoming acquainted with your classes, teachers, and the people in your class. Why is it so bad that I care about that?? We went to the gym of course, but just getting there was frustrating as hell. He mentioned how he thinks I'm a pothead. I can't believe his nerve. Just because I went to Riverfest last night with a friend doesn't turn me into a pothead. I was so close to telling him to just shut up. I didn't though, I kept my mouth shut. I'm very good at doing that when I'm pissed or depressed. I spent about an hour doing cardio. I mainly used the recumbent bike. I burned about 970 calories, and went nearly 19 miles (or so it said). I showered there, and waited for Jeffy when I was done. I tried to keep silent the entire time in the car, but I could only shrug off so many of his words that I finally talked to him (but just barely). He wanted to know what was bothering me. I really didn't feel like talking about it then. So I made something up about the arbitration. That was a mistake, I had to then get lectured about it. I wish that I had rbought ear plugs. I wish that I could have wrote on here last night, but something with the computer was wonky so I couldn't sign on. I have to go now, but if the comp. at home is straightened out later I'll post more soon.
