      Tosha's dead. My dad brought him in to the vets office again this morning to be put down. He said he most likely had cancer, and he was bleeding on the inside.

      Well, we couldnt find Tosha (my dog) tonight, we looked everywhere, and we finally found him in the basement, lying on a blanket, after he threw up and peed on the carpet (eww). He wouldnt move, and he wouldnt eat a dog treat or a carrot! he usually loooves them. he wouldnt even respond, like we said his name, and his eyes moved up, thats it. I think maybe he went down there to die, like, when Beauty died, she crawled under the tent trailer, cause she was outside, but he was inside, and i guess the basement is dark and secluded, isolated. He was doing better, with his steroids and all, but I hes even more sick than before. guess we'll see if he makes it through the night, he wont come upstairs, but the basement's night. its so hot in my room, i had the window open, my ceiling fan going, another floor fan going, no blanket, and had an ice cold shower before going to bed, and i was still roasting. plus, the water cooler isnt working, so ive had to drink warm water, better than nothing. but poor tosha, hes ugly, and stinky, but i love him.

      yeah, by like 6 or so, no one was online anymore, so i was bored. i went to my room, found my cat sleeping on my bed, and then, i mustve fallen asleep, cause i woke up, and i couldve sworn it was tomorrow already. and seeing as we're leaving tomorrow, and i still wasnt packed, i was thinking "oh no, i should pack" lol, but then i had the sense to look at my watch and see the "sa" for saturday. it was really confusing though, my brain was all out of whack for like 20 minutes. still feel weird, i only slept like two hours, but i swear it was longer.
