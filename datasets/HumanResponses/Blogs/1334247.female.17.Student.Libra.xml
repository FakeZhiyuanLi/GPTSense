      Friday night and I'm stuck at home. There's a basketball game tonight, but my mom doesn't think I should go because of the weather. It is very very cold outside and the roads are all slick and snowy, so maybe it's a good idea. It was alittle hard for me to get home today after school because the hill wasn't plowed or anything and it was very scary. I thought I wasn't going to make it, but I did (going only 10 mph by the time I got to the top).   Tomorrow I have to get up very early, and I'm not looking forward to it, but when I get back Micki will be home. WOO HOO.   I was supposed to try out for the musical tonight, but tryouts tonight were postponed to sometime next week. It is called "Honk" and it's some silly play. Not many of my friends are trying out, I think Kayla is the only one. It should still be fun though.

      I am starting a new blog, compliments to Buffalo Butt Breath.  No school today, due to snow. Last night I worked and my Chinese manager had no idea about three of us moving to grocery, and he was very very mad. However, I'm not on the schedule for next week for sacking (and the other 2 people are) so I dont know what's going on. I'm still looking for another job.   This weekend my sister is coming home. I'm excited. But, Saturday I have state show choir, so I have to get up at 4 AM, but return home in the early afternoon. I'm excited for show choir competitions to start. They're so much fun!   My New Years Resolution to exercise more is starting to die down. I think I'm going to go get a YMCA membership thing...which will hopefully make me go lift weights more often.   The school is doing a musical this year, about the ugly duckling or something (from what I heard). I think I'll probably try-out, considering I've been wanting to do the musical for the longest time. I don't know.

      Well, it's been a crazy, crazy week. Ok, I guess it's just been a crazy last 3-4 days. First of all, I found out that I only got 4 hours this week and 4 hours next week, so I am once again applying for different jobs, praying that one of them will hire.   Now, to the bad news. I was in my last class on Friday and I got called to the office. The secretary told me that some woman called to tell me that Matthew couldn't take me to the game that night. So, I went back to class, not thinking anything of it. 10 minutes later they said on the intercom that everyone should obey all the stop signs on the new highway by Argyle because there was a wreck. I got the pit in my stomach thinking it was Matthew, because he has to cross that road. Sure enough, after class I had a voicemail from his mom saying that he was in the hospital because he got hit my a SEMI!!!! OH, I was so scared. I called her back up and she said that he was fine, he was getting tests and X-Rays and all that stuff. So I went home instead of going to practice and Mom called the hospital (a friend of hers answered and told her everything that happened-he ran a stop sign because he was going too fast and skidded into a passing semi and got thrown from his car while the semi took off the front end of the car.) He's ok though...no serious injuries, just a ton of cuts and scratches and bruises-his face is really bad by his eye. He had to stay with me (at dad's) yesterday and today though because his parents went to chicago yesterday. So, we're babying him over here.   Now, the good news...C-Force got Grand Champions at West Burlington yesterday. We rock.

      This weekend has been mucho fun. Saturday was Central Lee Invitational, and the schools there were quite enjoyable. And, Micki came, and locked her keys in her car. Then, Matthew came over and we watched Joy Ride. Today the family went to eat at Applebees, I havent been there forever. It was good, I got to see my cousin Kristen, so that was even cooler. Now I'm home, trying to figure out what to do tonight. I think I'm going bowling with some people, but I dont know yet.   I really need to get a prom dress, and I have this one picked out that I'm dying to get, but the closest place it's available is in Des Moines, so maybe I'll see if I can go up and visit Micki and while I'm up there I can get that dress. It's very pretty, and very different from typical prom dresses (which is a plus).

      Good morning! I'm in school right now, with my beautiful boyfriend, Matthew, sitting next to me. He's showing me the Von Dutch hat he wants. What a cutie.   Micki, I REALLY hope you can make it home this weekend, because it's Central Lee Invitational...and I'm gonna make you come if you're back. :)   4 months today

      Today was West Liberty Show Choir Invitational, and C-Force got 3rd in 2A. There were some really good show choirs there (better than we expected). We didnt make the finals, though. Inertia got 1st in Prep, too. Rock on.   I go back to work in a couple days. Aaghh...I dont want to go back to HyVee. I'll still look for another job though. Look is the key word, no one is really hiring.   Thursday I had to memorize a 2-3 minute famous speech for Drama, I got an A!!! It was really hard to memorize, but I did really well. Mine was "Care in the Community" by Princess Diana.  A movie Nichole doesn't recommend: My Boss's Daughter

      OK!!! Any boys in high school who are going to prom, we need you to buy mugs. We only have 18 ordered, and we need to get more or else you wont be getting them.   Now, today was an ok day. Not too exciting. We're starting to do stage makeup in drama. So, that'll be fun. We also had to register for classes for next year. It's kind of scary thinking of being a senior. Yes, it will be fun, but it will be a little scary to know that it's your last year of high school. However, we need a minimum of 6 classes a semester. Unfortunately, I am taking 7 1st semester. I really dont want to, but I'm in band, and that makes 7 classes.

      Rainy today. I saw Dawn of the Dead last night. It didn't scare me too much. I got scared at the part with the little girl in the doorway...just because that kind of thing is really freaky. But, it didn't scare me like I thought it would.  Thumbelina is on right now. I haven't seen that movie in a really long time, but I'm kinda excited. I know that makes me sound like I'm 5 years old, but it is a cute cartoon movie...with many songs, which is a plus.   Well, Chelsea's prom dress is perfect. It fits just right. So, I'm getting excited. Prom is only about a month away. I'm excited.

      I found my prom dress. It's actually my cousin's (Chelsea). It's gorgeous though, I just hope it fits right.  No more show choir (other than swing show). We went to Quincy yesterday. Left at 5:45 AM and got back at 12:30 AM. It was such a long day, but in between Inertia and C-Force we got to hang out in the rooms, so most of us slept. But, we ended up getting last...Keokuk got first, I guess they're good this year (they've always been bad).  Although I only had like 5-6 hours of sleep last night, I'm so wound up right now. It's kind of nice out, a little chilly but sunny, and I really want to do something fun.  2 days of work this week (Tuesday and Sunday). So, Dad...I work Sunday from 3-7 PM but the rest of the weekend I have nothing going on, but I will give you a call today to talk to you.

      Matthew is doing great. He had a few doctor appointments, but now he is back to his normal self...all crazy and what not. But, he's my boy.   Our boys basketball team went to the game right before state tonight, but lost by 1 POINT!!! I was hoping they'd make it, but it still sounded like a really good game.   I'm still in the process of looking for a prom dress, and prom is May 1st.

      I just got back from Bobbi's house. We had a mint-making party (no alcohol, don't worry). It took us about 3 1/2 hours to make them, but it could've only taken a little over an hour if we didn't mess around. It was fun though, I haven't been with a group of friends outside of school for awhile, so it was a good way to end a good weekend. However, we got into the conversation of college and I think one of my friends got offended with what we were saying about not being set on one thing in particular in case you change your mind. She interpreted it as if we were saying she wasn't going to make it into fashion design and ended up leaving saying she was disappointed that I (not anyone else) didn't think she could make it. Hmmmm....Save the Drama for your Mama! But, the subject of college. I got a call the other day from a student rep. from U of Iowa and we talked for about 15 minutes. I got ask a lot of questions and he seemed really cool about everything.  Prom is this weekend. This week is super deluxe busy for me too. It's going to be awesome though. WOO HOO!!!! I'm so excited.

      GREAT job at Swing Show Nichole! We all thought you were great. Next year maybe play guitar, sing and do the bunny hop or chicken walk at the same time. COOL! I'm really proud of you.

      Oh boy!!! Tonight is swing show...and I'm getting nervous. That's no good. But, I'm crazy-because I'm getting the most nervous about my family watching me. I don't care so much about all the other people watching, it's more about my family and close friends of the family watching me. But, I had to practice with the microphones yesterday at school, and there were people in the gym, and I did fine, so I'm feeling I'll do ok tonight. It's just the nervousness...but, hopefully that will die down a little bit.   Micki's home. This morning was already an adventure. We went across town to get breakfast at the old Country Kitchen. So, we sat down and before we ordered our food, Micki realized she forgot her wallet at home (which consisted of all her money). So, we told them we had to run home real quick and we'd be right back. So, we finally got home, and both of us didn't feel like going all the way across town again, so we went to the Ivy Bake Shop instead (which is just a few blocks away from our house). So, it's good that we didn't order our food at the old Country Kitchen, but we did tell them we'd be right back.

      I hope everyone had a good Easter, I know I did. The weekend wasn't bad either. I had to work on Friday and Sunday, but they let me out a couple hours early on Sunday, so I was very happy about that. I got a lot of candy, too. Saturday was Matthew and my 6 month anniversary. So, he got to hang out with me all day Saturday. We were over at Grandma's for awhile and then we went church (an hour and a half long!!!) And, he also hung out with me on Sunday after Dave, Donna, Chelsea, and Gabe left our house. It was so good to see them. Chelsea is going to quit college and go to Chicago to become a starving actress-trying to get into commercials, movies, plays, whatever...So, good luck for her. I think she'll make it-but I am her cousin, so I don't know.  Saturday is swing show, and I am getting even more nervous every time I think about it. I have been practicing my song all afternoon, and my fingers are starting to hurt alittle, but once I get done with this I am going to start practicing again. :)

      I had a good weekend. I had ACT's on Saturday morning. Then Matt came over and we went and played in the park and had a picnic by the river. It was a lot of fun. Then, Sunday I had to work 4-10 but I got sick at work and had to leave early. So, today I would've had school, but I got stuck home, sick as a dog.   I found out that I have to work Easter Sunday from 9 AM till 4 PM. Wow, that really blows. I'm alittle upset...but I shouldn't complain too much, given that I have 13 hours this week, contrast to 9 hours. But, geez, could they give me any other day or any other shift than that?!?

      Wish me luck, I have ACT's tomorrow. I have already taken them once, but I figure I can try for a higher score, and now I know what to expect, so hopefully I will do a little better. A friend of mine is back from Colorado. He's only back for a week though. But, I got to hang out with him on Wednesday. It was really nice to see him again. He's leaving tomorrow though, so I probably won't see him again until summer...and then he's back for senior year. yay! Swing show tickets go on sale Monday. I still have to perform my song to Mr. Weinrich, and I haven't practiced it in a long time, so I hope I don't screw up too much. I'm really looking forward to swing show though. It's going to be great.

      Congratulations Class of 2004. You will all be missed greatly. Graduation went well. I had to stand, but no problems there, because I was with a few friends. At least I wasn't by myself. The highlight of graduation was definitely Kasey Kruse. Walking with a crutch his whole life, being born almost paralyzed, he got on stage to receive his diploma and walked without his crutch. Everyone stood up and cheered. It was awesome...I (almost) cried.

      Prom was a couple weeks ago. It was such a blast!!! Both Matt and I looked hot, too. Many compliments. Post prom was fun, it wouldn't have been if we didn't make it fun. But, I don't think I was really tired until I got home that night. However, the comedian/magician we had got really old after awhile when he found out someone went to Hooters during a school trip. Then, during the handing out of prizes, he'd ask everyone if they'd been to Hooters, and make other really stupid jokes about it...for almost 15-20 minutes. It got REALLY OLD!!!   The next weekend was Pella and State Music Contest. Pella we got 2nd. It was cold that day, and it wasn't much fun. State all three groups (band and the 2 choirs) got 3's!!! We don't think we really deserved 3's in any groups...actually we thought Varsity Choir should've been a 1 or a high 2. Not a 3!!! Oh well though...I guess there's nothing we can really do about it.   Now this weekend is graduation. The seniors' last day was Thursday, and one of my classes today had 4 people in it, continuing until the end of the year. The other 3 are close friends though, and it's a cool teacher, so we played Hearts (cards)-and I have no idea how to play-so I think I lost...but I had the best excuse you could use. It's kind of sad though having the seniors gone. I really got along with a lot of them.

      Please, remind me to never ever in a million years ever agree to come into Hy-Vee to clean again. It was horrible. I got called in and they told me I'd be cleaning the front entrance way and that I could wear street clothes, and that it's not that bad at all. Yea, I go in and the manager tells me what I have to do...I was thinking, "Oh my freakin' God!" I had to scrub everything--the walls and all these little cracks filled with dust and dirt piles. Then, I had to take a whole row of carts and move them so I could wipe off all the dead flies and bugs on the ledge by the window. Then, I had to take the motorized carts back into the shower room in the back (which was embarrassing to drive in the store) and wash them off. I started to get my pants wet when I went into the shower room so I pulled them up, and I looked like such a dork! (many of my co-workers saw me too). Then, I cleaned the security things in the doorway that beep if you steal something. All this in 4 hours. They also told me I had to get onto a ladder to clean the top part of the walls, but it was already 8:00 so I kept that for last and didn't have to do that. But, it was not fun at all. I like bagging groceries MUCH BETTER!

      Well, although it is the first day of summer, it feels FREEZING!! I am so ready for it to get hot and humid, just because it's been so cold lately. Grrr, arrgh. My wonderful sister, Micki, wants to take me to a HANSON concert in St. Louis at the end of July. However, I think we're going on vacation that week, so I dont know if I'd be able to go. Another grr, argh. I went on the river for the first time this year yesterday. It was Matthew, Dad, Julie and me. It was cold when we went fast, but on the way back from Burlington, we went very slow, and it was so nice.

      Summer woo hoo!! Yea, I'm enjoying it. It's been great weather, although today was pretty hot. I really haven't been out doing a whole lot, just work and hanging out with Matthew, but I've been having fun with it. I start my summer English Composition class tomorrow morning (8-11 AM). I skimmed through the book when I got it, and it looks like a super deluxe easy class. I'm not too worried, but watch me get in there and it's very hard....hmmm, I kinda doubt it. :)

      It's crazy how fast the summer is going by. I'm enjoying it though. It's finally really hot out. I've been waiting for this weather. Kevin has had lots of baseball lately with his regular season and his all-star team. Last weekend he had a tournament in Cedar Rapids. It was pretty fun. They lost, but it was still a fun weekend. Saturday night we went to ChuckE Cheese (Dad, Julie, Kevin, 4 other teammates, and me). On the way there, the boys talked about the 50-year old prostitute in Ft. Madison with a son named Elvis. I didn't realize how much you can learn from 12 year old boys. I won a slinky and some stickers. Sunday it rained in the middle of his game, so it was moved from noon to 4:00. We ended up staying up there an extra night with another family. I ended up watching The Simple Life with Kevin and his friend, Drew. Then, we went to The Olive Garden on Monday. Now, this weekend, Kevin has a tounament in Nauvoo. So much baseball.

      Fun 4th of July here. Saturday night I got to see Nauvoo's fireworks, with my brother complaining about the Mormon's half the time. Then, Sunday, I had to work until noon. After that, Micki picked me up and we saw Spiderman 2 in Ft. Madison. That theater isn't that bad...I figured it would be very sucky and kind of smelly like butt. But, it didn't. However, when the previews started, the music from the things before the previews was still going on. So, they lost a couple of points there. I did forget about that by the time the movie started. I LOVED IT! Go see it. When we got home, we watched Buffy the Musical, "Once More, with Feeling". I loved that too. I had already seen it, but it was such a long time ago, it seemed like the first time again. I think when I dance, I'm going to dance like Buffy, it seems fun. Then, that night we cooked out and got to see the Ft. Madison fireworks. Those would've been better if my 3 year old niece wasn't laughing and clapping the whole time. She was very loud. I guess it was kind of cute...but only kind of.   I had a funny blonde moment yesterday...Micki and I had to go into the grocery store to pick up hot dogs, buns, and bread. Before we left, Dad said to make sure to get bun length. So, we got to the buns, and I started to say, "We need bun length buns". I caught myself before I finished, but Micki still asked what I was going to say. Yea, he meant bun length hot dogs, and I thought he meant buns. Oops.  Another blonde moment from the day before: I was playing Outburst with Kelly and John and I had the category of cartoon bears. I named all that I could, and I was just thinking of different cartoons. I asked, "Is the pink panther a bear?" Ok, stupid me.

      Another boring day in the life of Nichole Long. I have nothing planned, like always. Kayla wants to go out to eat with me and then have me spend the night, but I'm not feeling it-if it were someone else.... It's also 4th of July weekend. There's probably a few parties that are going on. Exciting. I guess the Ft. Madison fireworks are supposed to be the best ever, so that's exciting. Sunday I go to Dad's for 4 weeks. I really need to pack.

      Pretty good weekend so far. I haven't been too busy. Just work, and been at dad's. Tonight Matt went to Cedar Rapids to see some friends. Even though I probably should know what he's doing up there, I really don't want to know. I wanted to find something to do with friends tonight, but most of them are out of town at a volleyball thing or with their families. So, I stayed home on this Saturday night with my dad and we ordered a pizza. It was nice. I start school now in 11 days. I can't believe it. It'll be nice to see Fish D. :) That's about it. I got my haircut the other day. I got bangs. They're cute. They took awhile to get used to, but I do like them alot. I can do the punkish straight, ragged look or the cute, girly, side swept, whispy bangs. Man, I'm cool.

      17 days until school starts. OMG! That's really not that far away. Anyway, I'm back to mom's now. Even though the 4 weeks with dad flew by, I'm still excited to be back. It's nice to see everyone. But, Tuesday we're going to Waterloo to the waterpark. So, I'm super excited because I love waterparks. Woo hoo. And, then next week we're going to Des Moines to Micki's and then we're going to Adventureland. So, I'm excited for that too because of the roller coasters. Woo hoo again. And, last week (the last week of dad's 4 weeks) we went camping at Lake Rathbun. It was very, very relaxing. I only caught 3 fish (2 within 5 minutes). But, it was still enjoyable. I also got to see Micki Friday night. We saw 2 movies (Bourne Supremacy and The Village) I jumped twice in The Village-one time was really stupid...I knew it was coming. But, I guess that's how it goes. Saturday we went to the Valley West Mall in Des Moines, and this thing called Iowa Idol was going on (An American Idol for the state of Iowa) and I only heard a couple of people sing--the first one reached a really high note and Micki and I looked at each other with the same "Wow, but we weren't expecting it" expression. Then, the second girl started singing "At Last" and she was pretty good. But, unfortunately, I left my purse in my dad's van (at Lake Rathbun) so I had no money, and three birthdays are coming up in this month and I had no money to get them anything. Oh well. They can just get poop. :)
