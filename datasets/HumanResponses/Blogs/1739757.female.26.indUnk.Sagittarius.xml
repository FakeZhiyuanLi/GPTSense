      Today is Rosh Chodesh Elul.  The day to start thinking about the next year.  What am I going to work on for the next year?  What will happen in my life?  Who will come into my life and who will leave it?    Today we start reading Tehillim #27, which has always spoken to me.    "Hashem, hear my voice when I call, be gracious toward me and answer me."  Isn't that what I ask for every day?  For Hashem to be listening when I pray, when I shed tears, when I sincerely ask for His help.  It amazes me that I can connect to these words that were written so long ago, that even King David wanted the same thing that I want.    "Teach me your way, Hashem, and lead me on the path of integrity, because of my watchful foes."  Help guide me in my actions, Hashem, because I know that everything I do can be used against me.    "Strengthen yourself and He will give you courage"  Please, Hashem, give me the courage to do what I know is right, even if it is not always popular, or easy.  Elul is a time of reflection.  Please let me have the courage to see myself in a true light, to objectively look at myself, and decide, first of all, what needs to be worked on, and secondly, what I can realistically accomplish in the next year.  Thank you, Hashem, for all the blessings you have already given me.  Please let me merit to have many more bestowed upon me in the future.    Thank you, Hashem, for all the challenges you have given me, and the fact that you have also given me the strength I have needed to get through those challenges.  Please let me merit to have more challenges, along with the tools to get through them, in the coming year.  And please Hashem, for all of B'nai Yisrael, let everyone find the same strength and meaning, and foundation, that I have.

      I am having very mixed up emotions these days.  It might have something to do with the fact that I am female.  I am not sure.  But what I am sure of is that I am absolutely fine one moment, and then the next moment, I am a mess.  I can't even define what is bothering me.  It is something fairly nebulous.  I am pretty sure it has something to do with dating (what else?), but I can't quite figure out why exactly I am bothered by it.    I know that everything is from Hashem, and that I will have what I need when I need it.  I look back at the events of the past year or so and I know that everything happened the way it was supposed, even if it was hard to get through at times.  I just hope that I have learned the lessons that I was supposed to and will not have to go through the same difficulties again.  I am not looking forward to the holidays.  Thank G-d, I have families that welcome me to share this time with them, but I really yearn to have a family of my own to celebrate with.  Even if it could be my parents and brothers, but that is not going to happen anytime soon.    Let me count my blessings though.  I have my health, certainly.  I have many wonderful, supportive people in my life.  I am very comfortable financially.  I have never lost anyone very close to me.  The list does go on and on.  I need to keep reminding myself.

      I was at a shiur last night.  I am still not quite sure what the rabbi's main focus was, but he said something that made an impact when I heard it.  He said, "It is in the  becoming , not in the  being ."

      I know I am a little slow on the take here, but I just got around to reading Shmuely Boteach's reaction to Dr. Laura's rejection of Judaism in the  urlLink Jerusalem Post .  While I have to admit that I have never been the biggest fan of Boteach's, I have to say that the article is extremely well-written and a very articulate response to the feeling of Dr. Laura "not feeling fulfilled" by Judaism.  I also find Boteach's article a very good delineation about feelings I have been having recently.  Being a baal teshuvah, and having made the choice to bring Torah into my life, I don't usually have doubts that the way I have chosen to live my life is the right one.  But it is not always easy to live the Torah life.  And lately I have to admit that while I have not been questioning my faith, I have been having trouble feeling connected with Hashem.    Boteach writes:  "To be a Jew is to pray three times a day even when it bores you to death, to starve in cities where there is no kosher food, and to go into the army to defend your tiny homeland even while American kids your age are partying in Cancun.   And for all that, your reward is to be hated by the other nations of the earth just for wanting to live.   So why do we do it? For the simple opportunity to walk with God, as Abraham did; brave tyranny, like Moses; and sing to God with harp and lyre, like David. These are privileges not to be squandered simply because we don't always feel all giddy inside. Even the most secular Jews have been prepared to be tortured and killed rather than be separated from so glorious a heritage."   Why do I keep doing it even when I am not feeling such a connection?  Why do I daven every day even when I have no kavanah?  Because I  can't  break the tradition and responsibility that Hashem gave us so many years ago.  Who am I to say, that just because I am having it tough for a while (and certainly tough for me is not any great trajedy, I know that I am incredibly lucky), "Forget it, Hashem, it's over.  I am only going to do what you want when you do what I want."    Boteach also says, "Man is created to serve the purposes of God, and not the reverse."  I think I need to keep reminding myself of that.  Finally, Boteach closes with, "Before she turns her back, I would encourage Dr. Laura to reread Moses' words: "For [God's law] is not something empty from you," with the famous talmudic commentary: "If it is empty, it is from you." "  I guess I need to keep searching and learning.  I have to find it in myself, Hashem has already done his part.

      I wish I could just not expect anything.  I hate when you get excited about the possibility of something, you play it over in your mind, you think you know what to expect...  And then when the moment finally happens, it is not at all like you expected.  The event that you had hoped would be extremely enjoyable, fun, easy, ends up being   fine  .  Nothing to write home about, certainly.  Not horrible, not a story that you can entertain your friends with or anything.  But just okay.  Blah.  Nondescript.    And that's not the end of it.  You have to see it through to the end, because you don't want to cut something out of your life because it is "just fine."  So now you have to wait a week to follow up on your fine encounter, to see if it could possibly be made into something more than fine, something that you might want to nurture, and make into a part of your life.  But you are dreading it, and in dreading it, will probably make it worse anyway.  So you really try to not think about it, to give it the benefit of the doubt, "it was a bad time", "you weren't at your best", or even "it will be better next time."  You hope that this is the case.  But in the back of your head you are thinking, "Why?"  Anyone have any suggestions for making a "fine" situation more enjoyable?  Please, I have six days and counting to find a new attitude!

      (Please excuse this post if it is less than eloquent.  I had a very nice blog written and then my computer decided to crash on me)  I feel the need to write something about the recent bombing in Israel.  It hit me hard for a few different reasons.  The first reason is simply that I can not relate to what would make a human being strap explosives to himself and kill himself along with many others, innocent children among the victims.  And to say that a religion would tell you to do it!  The second reason is that I can relate to what happened in a personal way.  When I was in Israel, I spent a lot of time at the Kotel.  It was the place I ran to for solace, support, comfort, to feel Hashem's presence.  I credit my first trip to the Kotel as a huge stepping-off point for my journey towards Yiddishkeit.  I never went to the Kotel where I did not leave feeling reassured that Hashem was out there, watching out for me, caring about me.  To think of having that feeling and then, minutes later, being struck my a bomber, is something that I can't fathom.  The other reason the bombing troubles me is that the bomber was dressed as a religious Jew.  I heard a thought-provoking vort on this topic a few months ago.  It was said that while the bombers are dressed like religious Jews on the outside, on the inside they hate Jews fo nothing other than the fact that they are Jewish.  The thing is, maybe it is a reflection of many religious Jews, who dress the part to perfection, but hate other Jews who don't look the part, or are maybe not as religious as they themselves feel they are.  They don't get to know other Jews as people, they just judge them as not being as worthy as they are, because of their religious level, as if evidenced by external appearances.  I guess the point is that it is time to stop judging everyone on their outward appearances and realize that if someone is a Jew, they are worthy in Hashem's eyes of being a Jew, and that is enough.   Please, Hashem, let these horrible bombings end soon.

      I read this today and thought it was good enough to share.  It comes from one of my favorite rabbis,  urlLink Rabbi Zelig Pliskin .  I know an individual who excelled in the ability to make people fell good about themselves. “What thoughts go through your mind when you meet someone new?” I asked him. “I always mentally bless people with success in what is important to them,” was the reply. When you wish people success in your mind, you radiate positive energy. Even though others don’t know exactly what you are thinking, they pick up positive energy. As King Solomon wrote “As water reflects a face back to face, so one’s heart is reflected back to him by another.” When your heart and mind generate positive energy, others feel good about themselves and good about you. All too many people think critical or negative thoughts about others. This is noticeable in the look in their eyes and their entire facial expression. With very critical people, the victims can feel very uncomfortable. How can these people change? They can begin by seeing the good in others and blessing them in their minds. Bless people in your mind whether they are people you know or people you are seeing for the first time. Whether they are people you especially like or you don’t for whatever reason. Whenever you see that someone has a troubled, worried, or sad look on his face, bless him in your mind. Wish him healing. Wish him solutions. Wish him joy. Some of the thoughts you can think are: “I wish this person much happiness.” “I wish this couple marital harmony and unity.” “I wish this person financial success.” (Upon seeing a person who is angry:) “I wish this person inner peace.” “I wish this person a healthy child.” “I wish this student success in his studies.”   When one’s mind is full of blessings for others, the very first to benefit from those blessings is the one radiating those good wishes.

      I am having trouble dealing with someone in my office.  I find this woman extremely difficult to interact with.  She changes moods constantly, at times treats me like I am 5 years old, and seems to feel that if she was in charge of everything then the office would run perfectly.  She also talks about our boss behind her back, saying extremely negative things about her, like that she is mentally ill and a control freak.  In general, I find her to be a very negative person.  I am not the only one who feels this way about her, my office-mate has confirmed that it is not just me who feels like she is negative and hard to deal with.    The problem is, I have read numerous sources that say that when something bothers you about another person, it is often reflective of problems you yourself have.  So I wonder if the reason she bothers me so much is that I actually have many of the traits I have a problem with in her.  I work very closely with this woman, so when I first started my job, I befriended her and became close with her.  The problem was, it was too close and I found myself engaging in behavior and loshon hara that I didn't want becoming something I did with ease.  So I distanced myself, and now don't speak of personal issues with her.  But this seems to have hurt her, and she now lashes at me unexpectantly.    Dealing with people is something that I am usually reasonably good at.  I don't think there are that many people out there who dislike me, and I try not to give people a reason to do so.  So that is why I wonder if the reason I have trouble with this particular person is rooted in my own issues.  Or maybe she truly is a difficult person to get along with.  I guess the real issue is, how do I deal with it?  Do I continue as I have, and just keep my distance as much as possible, considering we work in the same department and do have to interact on a regular basis?  Or do I try to say something to clear the air, and if so, what do I say without attacking or making it extremely uncomfortable between us?  And if my difficulties with her stem from problems within myself, how do I recognize that and make changes in myself?  I try so hard to be a kiddush Hashem, because for most of the people in my office, I am the only Orthodox Jew that they know.  I worry that if my interactions with this woman are something she see in a negative light, she will judge all Jews by that standard.  I feel tremendous pressure by that.  She has told me that she finds me judgemental, that she is "not going to hell" for her actions, and I try to tell her that I am not judging her, and I would never think she was going to hell, that is not even part of my thought process, but I don't know that she believes me.  And maybe I am being judgemental, I probably am.  But how to handle it???

      It amazes me how much weight factors into the average female's life.  I can't speak for men, because I don't usually talk about weight-related issues with them, and they don't seem to have the same focus on weight as women do, but I am coming to the realization that weight has a major role in most women's lives, even if they don't realize it.  A little background.  I have been fat for most of my life.  In the past year, I have lost 110 pounds.  I am still not what anyone would consider thin, but I am much smaller than I have been since before I was in high school.    I am not quite certain why, because I am the same person I used to be, albeit a lot smaller, but people react to me extremely differently now than they used to.  And honestly, I feel like I probably give off a much different vibe now to others than my size-26/28 self did.  None of this is a conscious thing.  I know that I have a lot more confidence than I used to and that I feel better about myself, and honestly, I just feel better, because I was having health problems before that I no longer have.  I am sure that radiates towards others.  And I have to admit that everyone giving me compliments on my appearance now doesn't hurt either.  But the thing I am realizing now that I didn't realize before, because I wouldn't deal with my weight or talk about it to anyone, is that many women's lives revolve around keeping their current weight where it is, or losing weight, or trying to squeeze into that size-whatever outfit in the back of the closet.  So much of our lives are what we are going to put in our mouths today and what it will do to our bodies.    I have found several good blogs by women who are trying to lose weight.  Some of my favorites:   urlLink Dancing Towards a Healthy Lifestyle   urlLink Through the Looking Glass   I find that my conversations at work revolve around diet tips, low-fat recipes, and new workouts.    I find that I won't let something into my mouth if I don't feel it is worth the calories (unless it is a cookie, which I haven't managed to break my habit of).  This is a major departure for me, who used to eat whatever I felt like.  Now I can't even bring myself to buy chocolate, something that I used to devour on a daily basis.    I am happy that I have lost weight, and I like the way I look now, at least most of the time.  But I am a bit concerned with the extent to which food now occupies my life, though I don't feel that I am abnormal in my focus.  I guess the question is, just because my focus isn't abnormal, is it really good?

      When I think about what defines me, I usually think about being intelligent, kind, independent, someone who is growing in their Yiddishkeit.  The problem is that it seems that what defines me to others is something that I have never had any control over:   urlLink Being From Alabama   Ok, fine, so there are not that many frum jews from Alabama.  Most of the people I know haven't met any others.  Fine, I understand that it is unusual.  And don't get me wrong, it is not something that I am ashamed of at all.  I recognize that I possess many qualities, such as courteousness and hospitality, that the South ingrained in me that I might not have gotten had I grown up in New York or other locales North of the Mason-Dixon line.  But is it really necessary, when I am meeting new people, for the person who is introducing me to stop all conversation in the room and shout out, "Guess where Shoshana is from!  Alabama!"  I don't feel like it needs to be the first thing that a new acquaintance finds out about me.  Nor do I feel it has to be the focus of the way people relate to me.    Does anyone else get this focus for other unusual characteristics?  If someone has an extra toe, for example, do they get introduced to others as, "This is Chana, guess what, she has six toes on her left foot."    I guess my point is, I want people to find out who I really am, not to just think of me as, "That girl from Alabama."  There is much more to me than that.  I hope that most people will take the time to find out.

      Ok, this had to come, right?  First off, I want to make it clear that I know that a lot of people have gone through a lot more with shidduchim than I have.  I am a late-to-start-dating Baal Teshuvah, and so I have not been dating for years and years like a lot of other people that I know.  But I have to say, I hate it.  I get so stressed out about dating, for some reason it is harder for me than most other things, and I hate how the reaction of a guy to me can make such a huge difference in my mood for the week.    If you are interested, you can read  urlLink My Worst Shidduch Experience Ever , on the net thanks to  urlLink She .  I sometimes feel, whenever I go to places where I see other frum people, that I have a stamp on my forehead that says, "Find Me a Shidduch, Any Shidduch."  People I barely know want to talk only of guys to me, and I can't tell you how many times in the past few months, when I have met someone or am talking to someone I don't know very well and they have said to me, "What are you looking for in a guy?  Maybe such and such..."  Now, don't get me wrong, I am totally flattered by the fact that so many people think I am mature enough to handle marriage and that they think that all these random guys would be interested in me.  I used to get very few suggestions, and that too was very frustrating.    My dream (and I call it a dream for a reason) is that Hashem would just plunk my bashert at my front door and that he will be wearing a T-shirt (or maybe a slightly nicer shirt) with the words "Shoshana's Zivug" on it.  Ok, so I know this is probably not going to happen, but I can always hope, can't I?  I think what I find most frustrating about shidduch dating is the waiting.  You wait to hear if a guy is interested, you wait for him to call you, you wait for him to pick you up on the date, you wait to hear from the shadchan whether he wants to go out again.  And I have never been good at waiting.   And I am not even going to mention (oh, whoops, I am mentioning it) the waiting for the right one to come along.  I keep hoping and praying, and reading Tehillim, and crying (I cry way too easily) for Hashem to send the right person quickly and easily.   I have a firm belief that Hashem knows what and who is best for me and that there is a reason that I have to date each person on my way to finding my husband.  But while intellectually I can recognize that, emotionally I have a hard time getting through it.    And I really try to make the best of each shidduch I go on, but it sometimes seems that the guys I go out with don't give me the same courtesy and I feel like shaking them and saying, "Don't you want to get married?  Isn't that why you are dating?  Come on!"  Anyway, had to rant.  I would really love suggestions as to how to handle the pressure of shidduch dating and how to keep your mind occupied while waiting.  And, by the way, if you happen to know a real mensch who is very intelligent, mature, has a quick wit, learns on a fairly regular basis, and is looking for a very out-of-towner, let me know.

      Ok, so today's musing is not so well formed in my brain, just a few things that have been happening in my life.  The big step that I took in the past few days - I actually signed up for classes at  urlLink the University of Baltimore .  I will be matriculating starting September 2.  It is a big step towards getting that degree that everyone has been telling me for the past five years that I need to get, and I have to say that while I am a bit overwhelmed at the prospect of being in school three nights a week and having tons of work outside of work to deal with, I am happy with my decision and relieved to have made such a step after talking about doing it forever.  Whew!  That was a long sentence!  My next step is figuring out what I want to do with my degree - if anyone has any good ideas of what to do with a Bachelor's in Psychology, let me know.  The second thing on my mind was that yesterday, Tisha B'Av, I heard several amazing and inspirational speakers.  I have to say I made use of the day to get rid of lots and lots of tears, though I have to admit that I am not sure I was always crying for the right reasons, but I figured if I was going to cry I might as well do it on Tisha B'Av.  The main message of the speakers was that we should always strive to sanctify Hashem's name in everything that we do.  We should always consider what Hashem wants for us.  We should look beyond our boundaries and try to determine why we are in the situation we are in, and what we can get out of it.   So, with Hashem's help, I am going to strive to look at each situation I am in, and really struggle to see the best of it.  I will admit now that this will not be easy and that I am going to fail many times at it.  But if I continue to look at everything as a hindrance, I don't know that I will ever learn what I am supposed to, and I may never get to move on with my life.  So, I am going to try to take each hurdle as an opportunity.  I will keep you posted on my progress.  If anyone has any motivational tactics to fulfilling this, please share!  So, Shabbos will be here in a few hours and I am looking forward to sharing it with friends.  Thank Hashem for putting so many wonderful people in my life.  I will be having a friend stay in my apartment, and I am happy that I can extend her the hospitality that was extended to me for so many years.  G-d willing, I will be able to soon have a guest bedroom in my own home to share with guests instead of making them stay in my living room.    May everyone have a wonderful Shabbos.  Shabbat Shalom.

      Just a quick musing on advice -   Lately, I have had several people come to me for advice.  The most recent was someone actually asked me what I thought she should do with her life.  Who I am to come to for advice?  I try to do the best I can, but later I wonder, "Should I have said anything?  What do I know?"  Any suggestions?

      Ok, here are my current thoughts on overcoming my particular nisayon of jealousy.    I have had trouble for the past few years (especially this last one) being truly happy for someone who gets engaged or married, because that is what I want so much for myself.  It is something that has bothered me, why can't I be happy for someone else?  Why can't I push beyond thinking about myself and feel for others in a more empathetic way?   So last night I was thinking about a friend of mine who told me how she would like to be married within the next two years (and even in two years, she won't be nearly as old as I am now) and how I was having trouble hearing her say that and really wish that it comes true for her.  But then I thought about how much I hate dating, and everyone I know who has been dating hates it so much, how it is so much pressure, and frustration, and disappointment.    And then I realized that I really did not want my friends, or anyone at all for that matter, to have to go through all those frustrations.    And in that moment, I realized that if I could focus on being happy that someone who gets engaged doesn't have to date anymore, I really can be happy for them.  Because I know what it is like to date, and I wish that I could be done with it.  I truly can imagine the joy of being done with dating, and that feeling is one that I can hope for others.  So, that is my new outlook.  Wish me luck in remembering it and feeling it the next time someone I know gets engaged.

      Ok, here's a blog that probably won't make much sense or be terribly entertaining, but it's stuff that I needed to get out:  I never did like surprises. I was always the kind who wanted to know what I was getting for my birthday or Chanukah.  I never wanted to wait to open my presents.  Nor did I make other people wait to open things I got for them.  Which is why I am having such a hard time believing that the right person will come along for me.  Why I have such a hard time waiting for him.  Why can’t I just know who he is going to be already?  Why do I have to go through all these wrong people?  I am sure the questions have been asked before, and I know so many people who have gone through so much more than me, I should be grateful that I don’t have any really horrible stories, that I have not been divorced, or abused or anything else.  I know that intellectually, but I am having a hard time with it emotionally.  And it makes it worse when I can’t keep my mouth shut.  I tell everyone what is going on with my life, and then my mom gets all excited and there is nothing to tell her.  Hashem, please, just give me the strength to get through this incredibly frustrating part of my life.  You know what else it is?  There have been very few things that I have not been able to accomplish.  I am not used to it and I don’t deal with it well.  I usually deal with it by giving up and acting like it doesn't matter, but this is something that I can’t give up on so easily and it really  does  matter.  It is frustrating, and irritating, and I have to go through it.  And I have to ask the help of lots of people along the way, another thing I am not good at doing.  Hashem, is this what you are trying to teach me?  If so, let me learn quickly and be able to move on.   Lessons for the day: Patience. Wait and good things will come. Hashem knows best. Learn something from everything. It is okay to ask for help when you need it.

      Tisha B'Av, the saddest day on the Jewish calendar.  Intellectually, I know what I am supposed to be mourning on Tisha B'Av, but I have a very hard time connecting with it.   urlLink Aish.com  (my first stop for jewish sources and inspiration) has a lot of very good articles about the Three Weeks, as well as  urlLink Torah.org  and the main  urlLink Chabad page .    But can we really feel like we miss the Bais HaMikdash?  Can we really feel sorry for the mistakes made in the Midbar?  I am not sure.    I was told that it is virtually impossible to miss the Bais HaMikdash today.  That it is extremely hard to want to have it again, because there isn't even another nation that has anything like it that we can be jealous of.  It was suggested that I go to the  urlLink Simon Wiesenthal Center  homepage and remind myself that with all the Anti-Semitism that is out there today, we really are in Galus.  And that we should want to get out of Galus as soon as possible.    And then I think about every day at work, when I struggle to fit in with my non-Jewish co-workers (and should I really want to fit in, or should i keep myself separate?), when I work at being a kiddush Hashem, a good example of an Orthodox Jew, since I am the only one most of the people I come into contact with know.  Just this morning a co-worker told me about an Orthodox woman she saw who she tried to smile to who wasn't friendly back, and I found myself making excuses for this woman who I didn't know, because I didn't want someone else to think that we aren't friendly.  And then I think, THIS is what it means to be in Galus.  It means that not only are we not seen as a light unto the nations, but people take every action we make and scrutinize it and put a negative spin on it.  It means we must watch our every step and be cautious with every word that comes out of our mouths, lest it be taken the wrong way.  This is the loss of the Bais HaMikdash, that we can never really be comfortable, no matter where we live or how much we think we have been accepted.  Until Moshiach comes, we must always be on guard, on our toes, and watching every step we make.

      To go to school or not to go to school, that is the question...  And one I have been struggling with for the past five years.  The question is, "Is it worth it for me to finish my degree?"  Ideally, I will be married within the next six months, have a baby in the year after that, and never have to work again.  Ha!  Just kidding, even I wouldn't be happy with that situation.  I want to work a bit when I get married and have kids, and I would prefer to have a job that I am suited for, and that makes use of my unique abilities and talents.  The problems are:  1) I have a unique talent in math, and my current company would encourage that talent by paying for me to pursue actuarial studies.  2) I love psychology, which you can do absolutely nothing with if you have only a bachelor's degree.  3) I would like to be a school counselor, but a) could I handle the emotional toll, b) could I find a decent job doing it and c) is it really what it is cracked up to be?  And further, I make more money now without a degree than I would make if I had a Bachelor's in Psychology and pursued doing what I want to do.  So what do I do?  More later.  Ok, thought about this one a lot and have decided that I do want to go back to school and will just take it one step at a time.  Right now the focus will be on finishing my Bachelor's in Psychology and then I will figure out where I want to go from there.  The school of my choice:   urlLink The University of Baltimore   A good choice for me, because it keeps me from having to be in class with a bunch of 18-year olds who are two seconds out of high school.  I decided to say "no" to studying the actuarial sciences because while I am very good at math, it is not something that I feel makes a difference in people's lives, and if I am going to pursue an actual career, I want it to be something that can make an impact on others, even just a person at a time.    Wish me luck!

      Ok, a complete musing (mainly because I just don't feel like doing work today).  My mind lately has been on dating, but I am trying to convince myself that life is not all about dating.  I want to get my mind off dating, and getting married, and "Does this one like me?" and "Why doesn't that one like me?" and get my mind on stuff that is really important, like working on myself so that I will be a good wife and mother, if I ever get the opportunity.    So, I need advice on how to make myself not obsess about boys, and how to make my mind switch gears.  A google search for "mind over matter" gives me:   urlLink Mind Over Matter: The Brain's Response to Drugs   No thanks, I don't do drugs.   urlLink Hypno-therapy   - Maybe that's what I need.  Anyone have any experiences they'd like to share?   urlLink Welcome to Spiritual Atlanta   Well, I knew I liked Atlanta for a reason!  Ok, maybe a different search would be in order.  Anyone have any suggestions for helping me get my mind off things that I don't want to think about?  I sometimes think I would be much more healthy emotionally and intellectually if I could just shut my brain off for a few hours, days, weeks or however long.  I think so much that I have a hard time understanding how people don't.  Is it totally a matter of personality?  That's just how I am, I can't help it?  Or could I help it?  Could I possibly stuff my life so full that I don't have time to think?  And would I be happy if I did?    That's my musing for the day.  Back to my regularly scheduled program (also known as work, I feel I should do a little of it, they are paying me, after all).

      Ok, a Blog for my musings.  I have been thinking about doing this for a while, but wasn't sure how I felt about exposing my thoughts to the public forum.  Oh well, I figure that probably not that many people will read it anyway!    Short list of stuff on my mind:  Dating (always seems to pop up on top) Being a mentor to someone - who am I to give advice? Being true to who I am  What is the purpose? Can I really tell someone I am right and they are wrong, even if that is the way I truly feel? Jealousy Looks, how important are looks and why does it have such an effect on my self-esteem?  Why do people treat me so much differently now when they first meet me than they did when I looked different?  Are people's reactions to me totally caught up in my external appearance, or is there a way to get beyond that?  Ok, maybe I won't tackle it all at once.  Feel free to send me an e-mail (shoshy1208(at)aol.com) if you have any ideas on the above.  Have a good Shabbos.

      During the ten days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, we are supposed to do everything we can to improve ourselves and be the absolute best we can be, even if we know it won't last after the ten days.  People take on cholov yisroel, pas yisroel, extra davening, etc.  What have I taken on for these ten days?  Not much, I am sorry to say.  I am trying to be the best person I can be, not speak loshon hara, not provoke anyone, I am trying my best to curb my sarcasm (something I have a lot of trouble with).  But as far as taking anything on, I am having trouble finding something that I feel I can manage.  Last year I read the whole book of Tehillim during the Ten Days.  This year I feel like I am doing well if I can manage to daven everything during shacharis (which is more than I usually do, at least it is something).  Does this mean I am in for a bad year?  I really hope not.  Please Hashem, have mercy on me for this new year.    As far as Rosh Hashanah goes, mine was nice but filled with stress.  I hope this isn't an indication of what the year will be like.  My tefillah was good, even heard and remembered a very good speech by the rabbi (which I really should blog about).    Sorry I don't have more to say during what is supposed to be an awe-inspired time.

      Just a quick note for all of my readers (ok, I know I don't have many) who have been worried about me - I just got the news that the power is back on in my apartment!  Let there be light!

      Rosh Hashanah starts tomorrow night.  For inspiration and things to think about during the holidays, I suggest  urlLink Aish.com  or  urlLink Project Genesis .  I truly hope that this new year brings everyone much simcha and nachas.    Rosh Hashanah, while making me focus on the New Year, also causes me to reflect on the previous year and what I have learned from it.  I think the biggest lesson that I have been beaten over the head with this past year is that I can't do it all alone.  I have had to learn that it is okay to ask for help and depend on others at times.    As someone who is independent to the point of it being a fault, I have had quite a few circumstances happen to me in the past year that have forced me to ask others for help and support.  This past week, being without power (and it still hasn't been restored, by the way), I have had to rely on my friends for showers, laundry, computer access and escape from my apartment.  And you know what?  It didn't kill me.  I had to admit that I couldn't do everything on my own this week, and it has brought me closer to my friends and shown me that it is okay to ask for help in times of need.    I think I will always want to be able to do things on my own.  But I think the lesson that I can't has been an important step in my growth process.  I wish everyone a sweet and happy New Year.  Shana Tova Tikateivu.

      Still no power.  5-1/2 days now.  Getting a bit bitter.  Moving on.  I attended a shiur last night by  urlLink Rabbi David Fohrman .  I had been told that he is an amazing speaker and I have to say that I had been told correctly.  Appropriately, he spoke about Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, about the attributes of each of the holidays and how they differ from each other, using the story of Jonah as an allegory for the traits of Hashem that each holiday represents.  I can not even begin to give his shiur justice here, but the bottom line was this:  Rosh Hashanah is a day of justice, where we are judged for our actions.  Yom Kippur is a day of compassion, where we are given the chance to show our potential and given an opportunity to live up to that potential in the next year.  Hashem is full of compassion for us, and He wants us to utilize our potential.  He can see the potential in each of us, and He gives showers us with the ultimate compassion to help us reach that potential.    May Hashem show each one of us His total compassion and help us reach our potential in the New Year.  And may we show just a bit of that compassion to others.

      I am still without power.  84 hours and counting.    But even if I don't have power, I do have a JCC membership.  And the JCC does have lots of showers with lots of hot water.  And I have been neglecting my JCC membership lately.  I am sure my membership card has been going through withdrawal.  So this morning, very early, I packed my bag with my towel, shampoo, and makeup, and headed over to the JCC to take my shower so that I didn't stink all day at work.  No problem, doing fine, almost dressed and ready to go when...  BANG.  Slammed my temple into a piece of metal sitting there just waiting for me.  So now I am going about my day, with a bump next to my eye, a bruise starting to form.  My inner klutz is laughing, once again.  It is telling me, "You will never grow out of this, just give up already!"  What a gift to pass on to my children.

      Okay, so I can now say that I officially lived through Hurricane Isabel.  While things are not back to normal yet (i.e. I still do not have power, when the heck is BGE going to get to my apartment?), I can say that I learned quite a few things from the storm already.  Care for me to expound on lessons learned?  Oh good.  1.  I have an electric-powered water heater.  Did not know that.  Have always had gas-powered water heaters in the past.  No electricity plus no hot water means that I have to prevail upon my extremely accomodating friends for showers.    2.  Kind of a continuance of the previous - Thank G-d, I have amazing friends.  Friends who have not minded the fact that I have descended upon their apartments while I am without power.  I knew this before, but times of need always reiterates that point in my mind.  3.  I do not tolerate not having power very well.  I get whiny and cranky and like to complain a lot.  I am not even quite sure why it bothers me so much.  During the day, I wouldn't typically have had the lights on so much anyway, there is not so much need for them, but I just could not stay in my apartment without power.  It just bothered me that I couldn't turn on the light if I wanted to.  4.  Dry ice does not last that long.  It does help, but only for a while.  After it is gone, it is time to move the food out or junk it all.    I am sure there were other lessons learned during the storm, but I will stop here.  Will keep everyone updated on whether power ever comes back (I am hoping for at least before Rosh Hashanah).    The next time you flick your light switch on - take a second to appreciate the fact that you can.

      I am sure you can watch the storm approaching on  urlLink The Weather Channel Online .  Will Baltimore be swept into the Chesapeake?  Will Virginia be made a whole state of nothing but beach?  Will the 10 inches of expected rain flood my apartment and drown my poor cat?  Will I be able to go home from work early and catch up on much-needed R&R?  The answer to these questions and many others, after the storm.   Now back to our regularly scheduled programming...

      Ok, yesterday was a bad day.  Moving on...  I have decided I am going to make a list of things and feelings I like.  I don't know why I am doing this, and don't know if you care about these things, but here goes:  I like:  Seeing a letter with a real stamp on it in the mail box when I come home. Answering the phone and hearing the voice of a friend I haven't heard from in a long time. Being with friends and stopping to realize that I really am having a great time. Finding an outfit that I love and when I go to purchase it, I find out it is on sale. Seeing someone I know on  urlLink Only Simchas . Being able to help someone else. Having guests. The sound of rain. Cuddling with my cat. Meeting someone new and really connecting with them. Being inspired by something I learn  urlLink about Torah . Reading a good  urlLink book . Curling up under my blanket on a cold night. Taking a walk on a day when the weather is perfect (high 60's/low 70's), the sky is blue and there is a gentle breeze.  Ok, that is a start to my list.  What are yours?   urlLink E-mail me  and let me know.

      Am feeling a bit down today.  More specifically, I think I am feeling like my options are running out.  Of course, I am talking about guys and the lack thereof in my life.  Went on a date this past weekend.  It was a completely futile waste of a couple of hours.  I knew it would be before I left for the date, I don't know why I don't trust my instincts more.  And I didn't get my studying done, so now I am trying to play catch-up.  I am low on sleep (which I am sure is contributing to my mood), low on energy (coffee, anyone?), low on money and about to cry at any second (hormones might be to blame for that one).  On the other hand, I was reminded once again last night how Hashem has blessed me with an incredible group of friends who I value beyond almost anything else.  I am in school and feel like I am finally getting something accomplished in my life, and it is intellectually stimulating, which I definitely needed.  I have a very supportive rabbi and rebbetzin who are there for me and care about me.  And my parents, while I don't see them on a regular basis, are there for me if I need them.  So the truth is, I really am blessed and have a lot more in my life than a lot of people that I know.   Hashem, please help me keep that in mind.

      I am going to New York this weekend.  Ok, so I know to most people, that doesn't sound like it is such a big deal.  But the truth is, I have never been to the city before (outside of the airport, that is).  Growing up in the South, New York was pretty far away, and not especially convenient for making a short visit.  Besides the fact that most people in the South kind of shun New York as too "big city."    But I have now been living in Baltimore for almost a year and a half, Baltimore being a mere 3-1/2 hours drive away from The Big Apple, and I still haven't made it there.  I know people who go up for a day, people who are there every week, but I have so far managed to avoid it altogether.  This pattern is to end this weekend.   So I have to say I am a little bit excited about it.  I don't know if I could ever live there, but I do think it will be fun to visit, at least once.  If anyone has any suggestions of something I just "MUST SEE," let me know.

      I have a mysterious bruise on my finger.  Yes, I said my finger.  On the inside of my finger.  I didn't even know you could get bruises there.  But leave it to me.    It spontaneously appeared last week after my first class.  I was driving home and all of a sudden I felt a pain on the inside of my finger (for those of you who are wondering, it is my right-hand ring finger).  It was dark in the car so I waited until I got home to look at it, and when I did, I had a bruise on the inside of the top joint of my finger.  I thought it was weird, but the pain went away after about an hour or so and the bruise went away after a couple days so I didn't think too much about it.   Then the other day it randomly started hurting again for a few minutes, but the bruise didn't reappear so I thought it was just a little memory pain to remind me that I still have that finger and to appreciate the fact that it is there.  Well, this morning as I am getting ready the finger starts hurting again, in the same place, and the bruise is back with a vengeance.  This time it is more than a bruise, it is actually swollen a bit and looking a fairly menacing shade of purple.  I have absolutely no idea what I could have done to the inside of my finger to make it so mad.  I don't even wear rings on a regular basis and have certainly never worn a ring on the top joint of my finger.  I am getting a little worried that possibly I managed to hurt my finger's feelings a bit in some unknown way and it is now trying to get back at me.  Maybe I neglected that finger in favor of the other nine, I am not sure.  But I am starting to be a bit concerned that this random pain and bruising is not so random and might need to be checked out.  Any doctors out there who can help me with this?

      There is a girl in my life who I met this past summer.  She intially called me because she wanted someone to learn with and she was given my number by an organization in town that sets up chevrusas.  Well, given my track record for actually learning with chevrusas (hint - it is fairly poor), I am happy to say that we have actually learned together on occasion, but what we have spent most of our time doing is talking about life issues, which to me is a form of learning also.  It is a new position for me to be the one who is more knowledgeable, the one who is doing the teaching.  It is something that I am working on, that I am a bit uncomfortable with at times, because I feel the weight of responsibility in being a role model for someone else, and I can see that I am a role model to her, that she looks up to me.    The weird thing is, as random as it was that we were set up to learn together, I feel that, in many ways, she is a reflection of me.  She has been going through some extremely similar life situations as I have been in.  It is uncanny in many ways how similar some of her recent experiences have been to mine.  Almost to the point where I feel like Hashem might have put me through some of those experiences so that I can help guide her through them.  (Don't get me wrong, I am not so arrogant as to believe that I didn't have major things to learn from the experiences I had, I know that they happened to me for me to grow through them as well.)  This girl calls me when she is having problems so she can get my advice, she asks me what she should do with her life, she seems to trust my judgement when it comes to how to deal with situations.  And she says that talking to me really helps her feel better about things, to calm her down when she is upset.  It is a major responsibility that I don't take lightly.  I feel like Hashem is telling me that it is time for me to help others now, that it is time for me to focus on helping others get through what I have already been through.  Only Hashem could have sent this girl into my life, this girl who has experiences such similar things to myself.  I only hope that I live up to the responsibility and do impact this girl's life for the positive.  Hashem, please guide me.

      Friday I got in a yelling match with one of my co-workers.  The same co-worker that I have trouble dealing with on a regular basis.  It's a long story, but basically it ended up with her coming into my office and yelling at me and me not being able to sit quietly and take it.  I told her more than once that I didn't think we should discuss it right then, but she would not leave me alone.  She personally attacked me, saying that I shouldn't present myself as being such a "good Jewish, Christian, upright person" if I was going to stab her in the back.  I felt I couldn't just sit there and be a complete doormat, and not say anything, so I ended up saying some things that were not so nice either, though I don't think they were on the same level of personal attack.  (You will have to take my word for it, but I could be wrong, because of course I am not objective.)  Driving home from work, I thought about what she said, and started feeling guilty.  My actions were definitely not a kiddush Hashem that day.  It is Elul, and I should be striving for growth.  I know that I can't be perfect, but in this situation, it is obvious that I am being judged for every action that I make, and I need to be extremely cautious in my interactions.  So when I got home from work, I turned on my computer and wrote her an apology, asking her to forgive me for my actions, and telling her that I did not intend to hurt her in any way, even stating that I need to work harder on thinking before speaking.  I got a very lengthy response from her, telling me that she appreciates my apology but saying that she doesn't feel she can trust me and that she doesn't think that I have her best interests at heart.  It goes on and on, making negative references to our boss and saying that she no longer wants to work with me on projects, because she thinks that I will consequently screw her over.   Sigh.   I am disappointed in myself for getting into the situation in the first place, but I think I am more disappointed to see that this woman, who is very bright and could have a lot going for her, has so many issues and doesn't even seem to see it.  I have no idea what the answer is here, or even how I should handle the situation, because I do want to be a good representative of Hashem, of Jews.  I am at a loss here, hopefully Hashem will help guide me in this one, because I definitely need the help.  And I hope that Hashem will help my co-worker, because I think she definitely needs some help also.

      I have to read  The Iliad  by Homer this semester for one of my classes.  The whole thing.  Quite a daunting task.  The first eight chapters are due by next week.  So since I have turned over a new leaf and decided that I will actually apply myself and study this time around with school, I sat down last night and started reading.    I read part of  The Odyssey  while I was in high school (which was a LONG time ago now), but never  The Iliad .  And the truth is, whatever parts of  The Odyssey  I did read, I have managed to forget pretty much everything about it (to be perfectly honest, I probably didn't read much of what was assigned way back when).  So, I was properly intimidated about trying to read  The Iliad , not helped much by the fact that the book could in no way be considered short.  But I was determined, and I picked it up and started reading.  Surprisingly, the language was not so hard to understand, and after a few pages, I managed to get into the rhythm of it, and was able to pick up most of what was going on.  The hardest part, I found, was keeping everyone's name straight (though I often have the same problem when I am reading my girly fiction books, so it shouldn't have come as a surprise).    So, I'm reading along about these great, powerful kings after a big battle, along with these Greek gods who come down to earth and interact with everyone, and I am struck by how petty all these supposedly mighty warriors are.  They fight over two girls, can't get along, and then, when they finally part ways, the king runs home crying to mommy.   Runs home crying to mommy?   This king, after the war is over, and he has to give up two girls that he believes he has won in battle (and don't even get me started on women being the spoils of war), goes home, starts crying like a baby, and asks mommy to go fix everything for him.  He asks her to intervene with the gods on his behalf to help him get back his girl.  And of course, she does whatever she can for her baby son.  I was quite surprised by this.  I am not sure what Homer is saying here.  Is he saying that behind the scenes, it is the women who run things?  Is he saying that no matter how powerful and strong a man might be, his instinct is to go home and cry on mommy's shoulder and ask her to fix things and make them all better?  I thought that these big, mighty men would never have anything to do with women, would see them as the weaker sex, as objects to be saved, but here, in this epic poem that is allegedly over 3,000 years old, men are shown as needing their mothers to right the "injustices" done to them?  Reading that one chapter went a long way into explaining some of the guys I have dated.  All I have to say is, Oh Boy.

      Yesterday was quite a day for me. I did two things that I haven't done in a really long time - I went to the dentist and I went to school.  Ok, ok, I know you are supposed to go to the dentist every six months, but somehow I got confused and thought that they meant every six years. (Fine, so I didn't really think that, just wished.) But I mustered up my courage and walked into the office and sat down in the dreaded chair. And you know what? It wasn't that bad! I couldn't believe it. I didn't have a single cavity (thanks to excellent home dental care and flossing regularly), and though they are already talking about cutting my mouth open to snatch my wisdom teeth from my jaw (I think they would be missed terribly), there is nothing imminent that needs to be done. I faced my fear and it wasn't half as bad as I thought it would be.  The other big thing of yesterday is that I started school. Had my first day of statistics class. While that might sound horrendous to other people, I am actually fairly decent at math and the class shouldn't be so hard for me. Of course the professor is having an extra session to explain the computer software to us on Saturday so I will have to miss out on that, she seems to be pretty cool. I have decided that my goal for the semester is to make all A's. I really feel like if I work at it, I can do it. It would definitely give me a sense of accomplishment, something that I don't know that I have had in a long time.  So all in all, the day that I have been dreading for the past few weeks was not as bad as I thought.  On another note, I got a thank-you note yesterday from a friend of mine who recently had a baby. I helped her out a bit, baking and helping her around the house a little. The note was so nice and gave me such a warm, fuzzy feeling. It is nice to be appreciated, especially for something that I didn't think so much about doing. It really confirmed the fact that it is the little things that you do that really make an impact on others. Even when you are not thinking so much about helping someone out, it could make all the difference to that person.  So, three lessons for the day: 1) Face your fears, they may not end up being as bad as you think. 2) It is the small acts of kindness that make such a difference in someone's life. 3) Dont' forget to floss.

      Okay, so the bruise on the inside of my finger has been gone for a while now.  I guess my finger decided that it could handle being in school and realized that I wasn't going to stop using it just because it chose to become discolored at random intervals.    But last night I am looking at my hand, and there is a very angry-looking purple bruise on the side of my pinky finger.  I have no idea where it came from.  It only decides to hurt  on occasion.  But, boy is it ugly.  My poor hand.  This bruise is in addition to the huge bruise on the back of my hand where I walked into the handle on the shower door and the many paper cuts and cat scratches that array the rest of my fingers.  Is it asking too much to have a hand that doesn't look like I have been in battle?  I work in a professional office, and go to school.  The most manual of labor that I do is carrying my backpack from my car to class.  It is not such a rough life.  Yet, by looking at my bruised and scarred hands, you would think I have been through eight wars and dig ditches for a living.  I hope that the guy I am looking for isn't insistent on having a girl who has perfectly manicured fingers at all times, because I have news, it ain't gonna happen here.  Oh well, things could be worse, right?  It could be my face that has such problems.  Oh wait, I do keep banging my head into stuff.  Never mind.

      I wanted to put a little dvar Torah up, because I realized that we are now starting the cycle again with Bereishis, and I figured I should start the year out right.  I will preface this by saying that it is my own thoughts, so accuracy might possibly be lacking, I apologize in advance.  In my class this past week, we were speaking about friendships and whether a relationship with an animal can be considered friendship.  Many in the class pointed out instances in which their pets showed displays of affection, emotion and even reason in regards to the relationship with their owners.  I could relate to this, as I know that my cat has a habit of eating very little when I am not home and certainly seems to show affection or even distress when he does not see me often enough.  Another person in my class told over a story in which one of their pets actually tricked another pet into getting the "good bed" in the house, showing the ability to reason and use some form of problem solving.  So the question is asked, what makes our relationships with animals different from our relationships with humans?  The Torah says, in Bereishis, Chapter 2, Verse 7, "Hashem then formed the man, dust from the ground, and He blew into his nostrils the breath of life. And so man became a living soul." (Thanks to  urlLink Tachash.org  for the text.)  I believe it is this "breath of life", what we usually call the neshama, that makes such a huge difference between man and animals, what makes the relationships so much greater between man and man, than between man and animal.  Hashem made humans "a living soul," not a living body.  As humans, we crave to connect with other souls, rather than hollow sentiment that is not based in a soul, which is the only thing that an animal can offer.    Hashem, in his incredible kindness, gave us this soul to be higher than animals, and to yearn for more than the average animal can offer.  And in yearning for more, hopefully we will be able to use Hashem's great gifts to benefit others.  As we begin reading the Torah again this year, may the lessons enclosed therein cause our souls to strive for greatness in Hashem's eyes.  Shabbat Shalom.

      So, my big class was last night and the topic was friendship.  We discussed the three different types of friendships as defined by Aristotle.  Aristotle discusses friendship of utility, where two people get something from each other and then friendship of pleasure, where it is pleasing for two people to be around each other.  Then Aristotle discusses the highest level of friendship, a virtuous friendship, in which the two friends both have ample virtue, and their friendship is about wanting excellence of each other, rather than pleasure or material gains.  Our professor asked us if we have any virtuous friendships, and most of the people in the class felt that they did, which surprised our professor.    He told us a little story about himself.  The friendship that he feels is the closest to being a friendship of virtue is with a 78-year-old woman whom he met on the Internet.  He has been e-mailing her back and forth, quite regularly, for the past six years.  Apparently they are very close and he feels that he truly respects and cherishes her for who she is and the values that she holds dear.  He has never spoken to her on the phone or met her in person.  According to Aristotle, this could not be a virtuous friendship, because in a friendship of virtue, there must be some proximity of location and common activities shared between the friends.  Of course, Aristotle could not have anticipated the Internet.  Our professor asked us if we thought that his friendship could be one of virtue.  Most of us felt that no, it could not be, because it is missing so much depth that in-person interaction adds to a relationship.  I think he was a bit bummed at his class dissing his friendship.  It made me think about my friendships, and whether they were friendships of virtue, pleasure or utility.  If I look at my friendships honestly, I think that many of them are about pleasure, and a few about utility.  But I do think that I have a few people in my life with whom my connection with them is about virtue, it is about absolutely wanting the best for the other, and not at all about what each of us get from the relationship.  I guess I should consider myself lucky to have that level of friendship in my life, I do know that it is rare.    I hope that I can sustain these friendships throughout my life, and cherish them for what they are worth.

      A co-worker of mine is obsessed with the video game  urlLink The SIMS .  She plays this game for hours at a time while ignoring the other responsibilities in her life.  She is fairly addicted to it.  Apparentely, the game is a simulation of life.  You have to build neighborhoods, acquire friends, get your characters in shape, etc.  It reminds me a bit of the  urlLink Tamagachi virtual pets  that were popular with kids a few years ago.  I have never played the game, so I don't know much about it.  A few of us were talking the other day and someone asked her what the point of the game is.  She tells us, "to get to the highest level in your character's career."  Oh.  Now this was something that I found quite interesting.  The game is about life.  Your characters have to eat, sleep, exercise, build friendships, and apparentely, the point of all of it is to  reach the highest level in your career .  Now I know that I live in America, where money rules and people work so hard to provide luxury for their family that they end up not getting to ever see their family.  But I found it extremely sad that a game that supposedly imitates life finds the highest goal, and the ultimate reward, to be a successful career.    What about family?  Why do people work so hard?  Getting to the top of the corporate ladder seems to be an empty accomplishment if quality time with the people you love is the expense paid for it.    I was talking to a guy last night.  I was extremely impressed with him.  He is a single guy, and everything he has done for the past few years, his choice in jobs, housing, purchases, have been so that when he does have a family, it will be the best for them.    That, I believe, is having your priorities straight.  What is a career worth if at the end of the day you come to an empty house, a family that doesn't know you, or children whose goal in life is to have the newest car?  I would much rather sacrifice a huge house for a family that I get the opportunity to spend time with.  If a career is the end in and of itself, what is it really worth?  Does it make someone a better person to be CEO?  I think I will stick to playing solitaire.

      I spent this past Yom Tov at the Yeshiva with a friend of mine who grew up there.  I have been there for Shabbos before, but never for a full-blown Yom Tov.  It was definitely interesting, and quite a difference from my typical Shabbos at home in my apartment.  This friend of mine is one of ten children, and all but one was home for the holidays.  This meant that altogether, besides myself, there were my friend's grandmother and grandfather, her parents, eight of her nine siblings, three of her siblings's spouses, her husband, and six children three and under crawling around.  It was quite a zoo, to say the least.    My friend and all of her married siblings, except for one, live in Lakewood, also known as the shtarkest place this side of Israel.  I have been there a few times, to visit my friend, it is not a place that I could ever see myself living in.    My friend's family is very nice, and made me feel extremely welcome.  But I couldn't help looking around at everyone, all the children crawling around, all the in-laws together, one big happy family, and I knew that I would never have what they have, nor do I think it is what I really want so much.  I can say that I envy the large, close family, bound by tradition.  I loved the fact that all the men knew so much Torah and that was the focus of discussion at the table.    But I also felt that there was something missing there, and I think that there is some merit in bringing the secular world into your life.  I think there is definitely something to be learned from embracing non-frum Jews.  I think when your entire life is so homogenous, you lose your capacity for being able to connect with others, and I think this is a loss.  I know that I do learn a lot from my non-jewish co-workers and classmates.  I find that in a lot of ways, my exposure to the secular strengthens my belief that Torah is the correct path, and it also forces me to realize that Torah encompasses all of life.  I think some people miss this lesson by never seeing how people who don't have the Torah get through life.  The truth is, I don't think that a family such as the one I stayed with would understand the lessons I learn from the secular world, I think they are not even open to hearing it.  But I have to say that I now appreciate even more that I have seen both sides, and chosen the one that I have.

      I sometimes feel that I am sitting in the backseat while my life takes me for a ride.  Weird stuff happens to me.    Okay, maybe I have some responsibility for the things that occur in my life.  Maybe I need better impulse control.  It is definitely possible.  Something to think about.  There is a story here, but I don't want to post it.  Have to protect the innocent.  Sorry t be vague.

      I got my first Statistics exam back yesterday.  I got a score of 106.  My teacher kept coming up to me and making comments to me like, "You don't need a review, do you?" and "You must be using a lot of patience to sit through this class."  Come on, I don't want the other people in my class to hate me!    The majority of my class is having a very hard time with the material, while I am picking it up pretty easily.  I have always had a natural aptitude for math, but this is the first time I am realizing how my mind naturally picks up the patterns and works them out.  I guess I have never given it much thought.    It was only recently that someone told me that this kind of stuff was hard for most people.  Two of my brothers have been taking calculus and having a miserable time at it and I didn't understand why until my roommate told me that she, who is extremely intelligent, had a very hard time with it also.    This is really interesting to me, the fact that people's minds work in such different ways.  To me, math is logical, it makes sense and that is that.  I figured that people who weren't good at math just weren't that smart.  I didn't think about highly intelligent people having a hard time at something that made such basic sense to me.    I once took a class on how the brain works, called Behavioral Neuroscience.  It was a fascinating class.  I had a very hard time grasping how memories and thoughts are really little electrical impulses going on inside the brain.  It is even more amazing to me now to know that each person's brain works in such a similar way, but so differently at the same time, and that is what makes each of us unique.  I think if you study the brain, you can gain a better appreciation for the complexity of human beings and how they function.  I know that for me, it gives me an even greater appreciation for Hashem's creation and solidifies the belief that there is no way it could have happened by chance.

      I think Alabama needs better PR.    Having lived in Maryland for almost a year and a half now, I have had the unfortunate opportunity to hear my home state,  urlLink Alabama  being dissed over and over again.  I consider myself to be an intelligent, well-educated, articulate person, and yes, I am from Alabama.  I don't believe those things to be mutually exclusive.  So, why is everyone so surprised when I tell them where I am from?  Some contributions and contributors from Alabama are:     urlLink NASA Marshall Space Flight Center   urlLink Helen Keller   urlLink Booker T. Washington   urlLink Zelda Fitzgerald   urlLink George Washington Carver   urlLink Rosa Parks   urlLink The University of Alabama at Birmingham  (my alma mater, and an incredible medical school) and many more.  I find that in any state, when you leave the big cities, you find rednecks and hicks and I am tired of people just associating that kind of behavior and ignorance with people from the South.   The ignorance that I have heard from people about the South gives a case for my argument - lines about pickup trucks lined with AstroTurf and someone asking me if Alabama is close to California.  So, Alabama, my advice to you is to stop advertising your worst and start promoting your best.

      I just had to post that I have received my first grade and it is a good one!  I got an A on the paper I had to write about "The Iliad."  It is nice to know that I worked hard on something and managed to attain the level of accomplishment that I am striving for.  It gives me a renewed impetus for continuing to work hard and see results.    Had a very nice Succos - the weather was beautiful and there were only a few bees.  Hope everyone else is enjoying the chag!

      I have lots of issues rolling around in my head today, but none of them are very clearly thought out, so I thought I would just mention them quickly and not dwell on them.   urlLink Protocols  has a posting with lots of comments, some of them extremely distateful, discussing Orthodox Judaism and homosexuality.  Rabbi Mitchell Wohlberg of Beth Tfiloh, a "Modern Orthodox" shul here in Baltimore, gave an interesting  urlLink sermon during Kol Nidre  that was meant to stir up a lot of controversy among his congregants and the Orthodox community at large.  I wrote to my professor who I no longer have a crush on and accused him of adding stress to my life.  He told me not to worry so much.  Then he forwarded the e-mail to all the students in his classes (thankfully keeping my name out of it).  Ok, so there was more to the e-mail than an accusation of stress.  I might be back to having a little crush.  I have a friend who I can't figure out.  I feel that there is always more to the picture than she presents, and our interactions leave me more and more confused about her.  I don't like the feelings she stirs within me.  I feel like I am not a good person with my feelings towards her and it bothers me.  Finally, I want to wish everyone a Good Yom Tov.   urlLink Here's  lots of information about  urlLink Sukkot.

      I am irritated today.    The first thing I am irritated about is the class that I formerly loved.  Well, actually the truth is I still like the class.  But I had a bit of a crush on my professor before last night.  The crush is gone, having been squelched when he handed us our mid-term exams last night.  I knew it was going to be difficult to write a mid-term in a week when I can't work on it at all during the weekend, Succos having taken away my Sunday.  But when I looked at the mid-term, I was very irritated to find that there is a question on it about next week's reading by Aristotle, which isn't an easy reading and which we haven't even discussed yet.  So, I am completely overwhelmed by the amount of work I have to complete for this mid-term, and completely over my crush on my professor (he is a bit geeky, anyway).  The other reason I am irritated is because my AOL is not working.  I am not being able to check my e-mail from work and I feel utterly and completely cut off from my friends.  Okay, I am being overly dramatic, but I like to know if I have e-mail or not.  The next part of this post is not so clearly formed in my head, so please bear with me if it is not succinctly written.  As for Idealism, in our class discussion last night we were discussing being motivated out of love versus being motivated out of fear.  Most of the people in my class felt that people are motivated in their actions out of fear rather than love, though most felt that it is a higher level to be motivated by love.  I realized what an idealist I am because I really feel that people are motivated by love rather than fear.  I don't feel like everyday actions are predicated with the thought of consequence first.  I also argued that children can be taught by parents to act out of love for others rather than fear of punishment.  Most of the class disagreed.  It is becoming a common occurrence.  I don't think I realized that most people are so cynical about life and act out of fear of punishment rather than respect for other human beings and their rights.  I am wrong to think that way?  Am I going to suffer for my idealism later?  I hope not, I would rather go around giving people the benefit of the doubt, otherwise I think I would find it very hard to trust anyone else.  I find it extremely discouraging to think that most people have this view of their fellow humans.  I hope that this class, in addition to irritating me, will not cause me to lose part of my idealism also.

       urlLink The Town Crier  referred me to  urlLink this article  about several schools in Maryland being closed for Yom Kippur.  Now, to this girl who went to school first in Oklahoma and then Alabama, and was usually the only Jew in her entire school, the thought of a school being closed for a Jewish holiday is one that is met with amazement.  A whole school being closed for a  Jewish  holiday?  Wow.  Then I realized that in some of the schools in this area, over half of their student population is Jewish and not much would get done with so many students gone anyway.  Then I read the article.  It truly is a piece of journalism filled with ridiculous assumptions and basic stupidity.  The line that baffles me the most is, "There is clearly an anti-Christian bias when it comes to giving equal opportunities to different faiths."  Excuse me?  Since when is it  Anti-Christian  to give  equal  opportunity to all religions?  And since when is giving a week off for both Christmas and Easter and one day for Yom Kippur considered equal treatment anyway?  Of course, then I look at who is quoted (the director of the Christian Defense Coalition) and the quote makes a lot more sense.  The article rounds off with a quote by Phyllis Schlafly, founder and president of the conservative Missouri-based Eagle Forum, who says "she is bothered that schools don't observe Christian holidays as they used to."   She said "some school districts in the country have abandoned the Good Friday holiday, and that some schools pretend Christian holidays have nothing to do with Jesus Christ."  Hello, have you looked at America these days?  Have you noticed that Christmas is more about Santa, presents and trees than it is about religion?  I call that a reflection of the times.  Not to mention the notion of separation between church and state.  Since when is it acceptable to force students, in a public school environment, to celebrate religious occasions that are not part of their tradition?  Having been a member of my  public  high school choir, I know the feeling well of being given the choice to either sing the praises of a "savior" that I didn't believe in or not sing at all.  I would never have dared for equality, would never have asked to sing Jewish songs, that would be blasphemous in my "Bible belt" environment.  I didn't even object to singing the more secular of Christmas songs, such as "Jingle Bells" or "Frosty the Snowman."  But heaven help me when I opposed to singing "O Little Town of Bethlemen" or "Away in a Manger."  I was a pariah and outcast for having a problem with these "holy" songs being sung in a public school.  So for the people who think that "equality of religion" equals "anti-Christian bias," and that having one day off school for Yom Kippur and two weeks off school for Christian holidays is "equal treatment," I have news for you - you have no idea how good Christians have it in America.  Get over yourself.

      Yom Kippur is over, Succos is coming, the weather feels like fall (or colder).  I would like to write a deep blog about my Yom Kippur and how inspiring it was and how I am so different now, but the truth is, I can't.  While the davening was meaningful, it didn't have the effect on me that it did last year.  Maybe I didn't do enough preparation for the day, I am not sure.  Maybe it was the fact that at the Break-Fast that I went to I saw a guy that I dated who I think is one of the greatest guys I know, but just can't marry, and it bothers me.  I am not sure.    But here I am, sealed for a new year, hoping that it will bring good things.  I hope that I make it through working full-time and being in school and manage to both well.  Of course, I hope to find the person I will marry.  But I know it is all in Hashem's hands, so I have decided that I am not going to obsessively worry about it anymore.  I will take the punches as they come.    I had a friend say to me right before Yom Kippur that she really values my friendship.  I really value hers as well and hearing her say that really made me feel good.  I had the mother of a family I am close with come up and hug me out of the blue at the Break-Fast last night.  These are the moments that I hope to dwell on and cherish in the coming year.    I wish everyone these wonderful moments as well.

      This Shabbos is Shabbos Shuvah, the Shabbos between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.  I have always found it to be a very introspective, spiritual Shabbos for me, where I am scrupulous about hilchos shabbos and try to keep myself focused on being the absolute best that I can be.  I have had a hard time focusing on improving myself this week, because I have had so much else to focus on.  I hope Hashem will decide that I have done enough.  I want first to wish everyone a meaningful and inspiring Shabbos Shuvah, and easy Yom Kippur fast and a positive and growthful new year.  I would secondly like to humbly ask the forgiveness of anyone who I have inadvertently or not so inadvertently offended or hurt in the past year.  I gave an assignment to my chevrusa a few weeks ago to come up with one thing that she is going to work on in the coming year and five practical ways that she is going to do so.  She gave it a lot of thought and found something she is going to work on.  I didn't complete the assignment myself.  So here goes:  In the coming year, I am going to work on accepting the fact that I can't do everything on my own.  I am going to work on this by: 1.  Asking for help when I need it. 2.  Talking to my rabbi and rebbetzin when I have a halachic or ethical matter I need guidance on. 3.  Asking people I respect for advice when I need it. 4.  Let go of things that I can not fit into my day and accept that it is okay for me to not be able to do everything. 5.  Accept constructive criticism as that, not as a personal insult.  I will keep you posted on my progress.

      Okay, just some random musings today, because I am happy that it is almost the end of the week and I can home tonight before it gets dark.  First, I looked up "Shoshana" on  urlLink Googlism  to see what it thought about me.  Not all of the comments were flattering, or accurate to say the least, but it was certainly funny.  Some of my favorites:   shoshana is from the dc area  (not too far off there)  shoshana is sitting comfortably on the bed  (don't I wish)  shoshana is up there in "slimness"  (again, don't i wish)  shoshana is very generous with her time  (I try)  shoshana is stubborn and persistent  (How did they know?)  shoshana is my best friend  (awww)  shoshana is a font of heartfelt gift ideas   shoshana is wasting the saleswoman's time   Ok, on to other stuff.  I went through my shortest shidduch ever last night.  When I was in New York a few weeks ago I randomly met a woman in the lobby of my friend's building and she called me with a shidduch.  The guy called me last night.  We spoke for twenty minutes.  He first interrogated me about why I became religious and what exactly appealed to me about Judaism.  He then told me about himself, how he does everything Min Hashamayim (no problem there) and how he likes to take on chumros in order to serve Hashem better (big problem there).  He shows absolute devotion to Hashem and mitzvos in everything he says, and absolutely no personality whatsoever.  He then asks me what I think.  I tell him, "I don't think so."  He wished me a good new year and good luck finding someone.  Over and done with, so glad I didn't have to endure a date with him.  I had my fun class last night, where we debate issues and try (with extremely limited success) to come to conclusions about ideas that impact life.  I love this class because it really makes me think about my beliefs and it has really helped me see where Torah fits into everything that occurs in life.  In class last night, we got onto the topic of differences between men and women.  The majority of the class is of the belief that gender differences are based on societal expectations and that they are caused by nurture rather than nature.  I have a huge problem with that.  Men and women are different by nature.  Of course there are always going to be some exceptions, but you can generally categorize some traits as being feminine or masculine.  What society has done is told people that it is not right to generalize or treat someone different based on their gender.  And I think this is a major problem with society today.  Women and men have different needs, not only physically, but emotionally as well.  There were only a few people in the class who agreed with me on this point.  It scares me a bit.  Okay, final random musing for the day.  Are there people in your life that when you are around them, you just feel good?  You are not sure why, but when you are with these people, you have so much fun, you are completely comfortable and yourself, and you feel that they appreciate you for who you are.  I have two friends who I feel that way about.  I saw them both last night and it made my day.    Happy Thursday.

      Everyone seems to be talking about a new book by  urlLink Rabbi Benjamin Blech , entitled  urlLink If God is Good Why is the World So Bad? .  I have, in the past week or so, seen articles about this new book on  urlLink Jewsweek  and  urlLink Aish.com .  A guy I went out with bought me a copy of the book when we were browsing through a bookstore (don't even ask, for some reason the guys I go out with seem to find a need to give me things).  I thought that it looked interesting and that I might send it to my brother, who has recently been asking theological questions lately.  I wanted to read it first to make sure that it wouldn't be over my brother's head, since he doesn't have much background when it comes to Jewish knowledge.  So I started slowly reading the book, reading a few pages a night when I could fit it in, with no idea that it was going to be the new book that everyone is reading.  After seeing how popular it suddenly is, I decided that maybe I should devote a bit more attention to it, and since it is the Aseres Yamei Teshuvah, I wanted to focus on reading material that was good for my neshama, so I have been spending a decent amount of time on it this past week.  And I have to say, it has given me a lot to think about.  Last night I came across a passage that really made me think.  It was talking about the reason for the death of a baby, but I feel like it can be applied to much more than just that circumstance.  It was saying that sometimes Hashem gives us something and then takes it away, causing pain and suffering on our part.  Rabbi Blech explains that the reason for this could be that we are in debt to Hashem and Hashem wants us to be able to clear our account.  We can be in debt because of a past action that we have committed that has caused a distance in our relationship with Hashem.  Because we do not have what we need to repay Hashem in the bank, He gives us the amount to be paid back, but then takes it away to repay the loan.  This often causes a lot of pain and hurt, but also causes growth and through that growth, a renewed closeness with Hashem.  In looking back at the things I have dealt with in the past year, I have often wondered why they have happened.  I know that there is no way for me to understand the why of the world, it is only for Hashem to know.  Why would Hashem send someone into my life that I thought would be part of my life forever, and then take him away from me so suddenly, for such crazy reasons ( urlLink see my story )?  I know that what I went through caused nowhere near the same amount of grief as the loss of a child would, but I really feel like the metaphor Rabbi Blech uses can be applied to my life as well.  I was in debt to Hashem, and probably was distanced from Him in many ways.  And my experience definitely did cause me to grow and become closer.  So, I guess if that is what it took to teach me what I needed to learn and repair my relationship with Hashem, then it was worth it, and I should thank Hashem for putting me through that pain.    And I have to say that I can now appreciate that guy who bought me the book, even if there was no way it was a good shidduch.

      My last post had something weird happen to it, not really sure what, but I know that I can't recreate it.  My thoughts change too much from minute to minute to try to recreate the ones I was having yesterday morning.  I had a nice Thanksgiving, spent as usual, with someone else's family.  I hope that when I have a family of my own, they will want to be with me, rather than half way across the country, feeling like it is too much effort to put in to see me.  I talked to my mom and brothers yesterday, and that was nice.  My dad didn't call.  It has been so nice to have a few days off and see my friends.  For a while, I was beginning to feel like I had lost my friends to being so busy.  I am now really looking forward to reconnecting with everyone over winter break.  I really am blessed. Thank you Hashem.

      Yea!  I have a day off!  Of course, I am going to spend it doing school work, big surprise.  I have a paper that needs lots and lots of work that I will hopefully be very proud of when it is done and a extremely large amount of reading for next week.  The authors who said that you learn everything you need to know in kindergarten obviously didn't go to college.  Shakespeare has a lot of respect from me these days.  My professor has been telling me since the beginning of the semester that the things we are reading are important because they are so relevant today, that human nature does not change, and the authors of our great literature had deep insight into how human minds work.  I totally buy it now.  While reading Othello, I thought it was so sad that everyone in the story misjudged everyone else, that no one had any idea what was going on in the other people's minds.  No one in the play ever lied, but there was definitely some deceit going on.    I now think it is amazing how little we really can see someone else.  You can have an experience with a person, and have extremely similar feelings about that experience.

      Tomorrow is Thanksgiving.  Because I won't have the opportunity to spend the holiday with my family, I have been trying to convince myself that it is nothing more than a few days off for me.  But the truth is, I have a lot to be thankful for and I thought I would enumerate some of those things here.  1.  I have a roof over my head, plenty of food to eat and clothes to wear.  I know these sound basic, but I know that there are plenty of people out there who don't have these things.  2.  I have family and friends who truly do care about me.  While I may not see or speak to these people as often as I would like, I know that they are there for me and it makes a huge difference knowing that I have them to back me up.  3.  I have my health.  Thank G-d, I really am incredibly healthy.  Every time I have a cold, and think that I can no longer function, I need to remind myself that I have to deal with so much less than so many others.  4.  I have my mind.  Hashem has given me a good brain, and being in school this year has made me realize how lucky I am that it works so well and I am able to use it to easily.  5.  I have the capacity to care about others and do chesed.  It helps mold me into a better person day by day.    These are only a few of the many, many things that I am fortunate enough to have in my life.  I hope everyone can be so lucky as to be able to step back and count the numerous blessings that Hashem has given us.

      The new topic that we are discussing in one of my classes is emotional intelligence.  I am not sure I buy the concept so much, but I am beginning to worry, I think mine might be fairly low.    If you base it on the criteria of knowing what your emotions are, why you are having them, and dealing with them on a constructive basis, I am not sure I would score so high.  I have to delve very deeply to try to figure out what I feel about stuff, and even when I do, I am not always sure where my emotions are coming from.  Of course, I don't have too much to compare to either, I haven't read enough of the book yet to see where most people are, maybe I am totally normal and being hard on myself.    If I am low in emotional intelligence, I might have to come up with some way to compensate.  Maybe my cookie-baking skill can make up for it.

      Back to work.  Had a good weekend, though I have been feeling a bit lonely these days.  A bunch of my friends were out of town for the weekend so that could definitely have contributed to the feeling.  Have decided that I must get back into the routine of working out.  I took a two-mile walk yesterday in this gorgeous park and I really enjoyed myself.  It felt good to be out in the fresh air and walking around, getting a bit of exercise.  Of course, today my leg is hurting, but you know what?  It is worth it.  Not much else to report.  I am looking forward to having a three-day work week.  The benefits of Thanksgiving without having to deal with family.  But I kind of miss them too.

      I am in a better mood today.  I have decided that I don't need to decide what I want to do with the rest of my life yet.  My new philosophy on school is that it is less important to finish and more important to learn about the things I am interested in.  So I am going to take some classes that I just think I will enjoy even if it means that it will be a longer road towards getting my degree.  It's already been eight years, what difference does an extra one make?  I hate my job, but I am going to make the best of it until I can practically do something else.  If it means that I spend a lot of time at work doing homework or whatever, oh well.  I would rather be happy and not worry about it than be miserable.  Is ignorance bliss?  That is my new question to ponder.  Would I be happier without the information that I am gaining?  I am writing a paper which kind of revolves around this topic.  I think the answer is that ultimately, we are better off with knowledge, that our world is more clear and we gain a lot more from it.  Though ignorance might be easier in a lot of ways, we benefit and can benefit others, through knowledge.  I don't think I can ethically allow myself to bury my head in the sand, even if I think it would help me sleep at night.   My plans for the weekend are extremely nebulous at this point, though grocery shopping would certainly be a good start.  It is amazing how creative you can be when the only things you have in your kitchen are a potato, onion, eggs, cheese, tomato sauce and puff pastry.  That was my equation for figuring out dinner last night.  And it actually turned out pretty good.  Go me!  Have a good Shabbos!

      I have no idea what I want to do with my life.  I keep changing my mind, basically on a daily basis, about what I love and what I want to fill my life with.  I thought that I was going to college to get on track to do something I care about, but everything I learn keeps confusing me and makes me wonder if I will ever figure any of it out.  I thought I really loved Psychology, but I don't feel like I am learning very much in my Psychology class.  I am good at math, and I enjoy figuring out problems, but if that is what I decide to do with my life, I might as well quit college and let my boss pay for the actuarial classes she wants me to take.    I love my Arts and Ideas class, it makes me think like crazy, but what on earth can I do with it?  I could read a lot and drive myself insane thinking about big issues all the time.  But I can do that without a degree and it doesn't exactly pay the rent to sit around and read great authors all day.  Anyway, we talked about Othello last night in class.  The book is full of characters who have no idea who the others are.  We were discussing how people can determine who other people really are.  I feel like you really can't know who anyone else truly is, and it is hard to really even know yourself.  This is for a number of reasons.    First of all, who you are changes constantly.  I am definitely not the same person that I was five years ago, or even one year ago.  Best case scenario, you are constantly working on yourself and improving yourself, learning from all the experiences that happen in your life.  Worst case scenario being that you are going downhill.  No one can stay the same forever, life has to have some effect.  A friend of mine likened life to a fish swimming upstream, if you are not working hard to make progress, you are flying backwards.  But I think it is hard to know who someone really is for another reason.  We play different roles depending on what setting we are in.  When I am with my family, I am a totally different person than when I am with my friends.  And when I am with my friends, I am a completely different person than when I am at school.  In a lot of ways, this is unconscious.    Throughout life, we teach ourselves that different people expect different things from us, and we play to those expectations.  When I was younger, I learned that smart girls intimidate guys, so I taught myself to act dumb when I was on dates.  Today, that is not the image that I necessarily want to project, but because I ingrained it in myself, I have a very hard time letting my intellect show through when I am around a guy that I like.  How do we figure out which persona is our real self?  I don't know.  I guess that is why I am having so much trouble figuring out what I really want to do with my life.  Depending on the setting I am in, and the focus I have at the moment, I enjoy different things and want different things to be the center of my life.  How do I find out what really cuts to the core of who I am, what I really want to focus on for the rest of my life, what will really give me satisfaction?  If you can help me out on this one, let me know, because right now I sure am confused.

      goes the clock.  The day has been creeping by, I am about to go crazy and I still have an hour left.  Probably due in part to the fact that I feel I have done extremely little productive work today.  Oh, but I managed to complete a personal project for my boss.    It is raining cats and dogs out, they are talking about floods and tornadoes.  Ahh, reminds me of Alabama.    Not too much deep thinking going on today, but at least I am not driving myself crazy.  I am not looking forward to my class tonight, I think the discussion is going to be a bit dark and on the depressing side.  64 minutes before I can leave.  Oh wait, 63 minutes now...

      I had a fairly uneventful weekend.  Determined to rid myself of the cold that has been plaguing me for the past week, I spent much of the weekend in bed.  I think I slept more in the past weekend than I have during an average two weeks since I started school.  Though I am very sneezy today (which is odd, since this is a new addition to my cold symptoms), I am feeling much better in the congestion, coughing, and running-a-fever departments.  I did take the time to read  Othello  this weekend.  Okay, don't get excited, it was an assignment of course, I didn't choose to read it of my own volition.  I am already dreading the class discussion of this play.  It was depressing, as I guess tragedies usually are.  I was a bit upset at the portrayal of the character of the main players.  Othello is initially described as being trusting and being positive about human nature.  But he turns on his own wife extremely easily, while trusting the evil Iago.  Iago is believed by everyone in the play to be honest, it is said over and over how honest he is, while he is truly despicable, plotting against everyone.  And Desdemona, the truly tragic character in the play, is the one person who really, truly cannot even imagine someone being sneaky or anything less than loyal, gets turned against and tricked, and eventually killed by her own husband who won't believe anything she says.  This idealistic, trusting soul (could I possibly be connecting to a character in the play) is played the fool, is not trusted, is killed for someone else's rotten scheming.  What is Shakespeare saying here?

      I have to work on a paper that is due on Monday.  The topic is my personality type, which is an Idealist.  This is how my personality type is described:   Idealists, as a temperament, are passionately concerned with personal growth and development. Idealists strive to discover who they are and how they can become their best possible self -- always this quest for self-knowledge and self-improvement drives their imagination. And they want to help others make the journey. Idealists are naturally drawn to working with people, and whether in education or counseling, in social services or personnel work, in journalism or the ministry, they are gifted at helping others find their way in life, often inspiring them to grow as individuals and to fulfill their potentials.  Idealists are rare, making up no more than 8 to 10 percent of the population. But their ability to inspire people with their enthusiasm and their idealism has given them influence far beyond their numbers.   Yep, that about sums me up.  If you want to know what you are, go  urlLink here.

      We spoke about leadership in my class last night.  I wasn't feeling very well so I didn't chime in as much as I usually do, but as has become the habit, my class disagrees with most of what I believe.  You can blame me for being an idealist.  Here is what I came home and wrote:  When I look at the great Jewish leaders throughout history, there are leaders that people respected and listened to and followed.  The leaders whose opinions and advice has endured throughout the years are distinguished by having sterling  characters.  Most of these leaders did not seek out leadership; they were pushed into their positions by virtue of the qualities that they possessed.  They were admired for their integrity, piety, dignity and the respect that they showed others.    Moses was the ultimate example of this.  Moses did not want to be the leader of the Jewish people; he pleaded with God to be kept out of the limelight.  Moses was known as the most humble person who ever lived.  However, this humility did not mean that he was unable to utilize the gifts that God gave him for the benefit of other people.  Because he recognized that the attributes that allowed him to lead his people were a gift from God, he did not feel he was above the rules that applied to everyone else.  In contrast, Moses was held to an even higher standard than everyone else and even minor mistakes that he made were punished very harshly.  It is said that attitude is a reflection of leadership.  If a leader lies and cheats and steals, the attitude of that leader’s nation will be one of moral decay.  But if a leader treats each person with respect and decency and makes his decisions with uprightness, then the attitude of his followers will be a reflection of those ideals.  Does it matter what leaders do in their private lives as opposed to their public lives?  Only in that it is very hard to hide what is at the core, and if the core (private life) is rotten then the rest of the fruit (the public life) will not follow far behind.  In contrast, I also believe that the more you practice doing the right or good thing, the more it becomes a part of you and you end up becoming that good thing.   Do the ends justify any means?  I don’t think so.  I think a lot of times the path you take to get somewhere is more important than where you actually end up.  The lessons learned along the way can be of greater value than the final reward.  If you choose to take a path of integrity and respect for others, it can sometimes lead you far astray of where you initially are headed.  But even if you don’t end up at your original destination, you may find that you have profited much more than if you had followed the direct route.  So, I guess what I am saying is, first of all, I don’t agree with Machiavelli on much (I’m sure that is not much of a shock).  But second, I think we should look more to the leaders who are in their positions because of their merits and deeds, rather than those leaders that have campaigned to be on top.  The former might be hard to find, but I think we will learn a lot more from them and ultimately, they will inspire us to be better people.

      Okay, I will admit that yesterday's post was a bit overly dramatic.  I have calmed down quite a bit since yesterday and am in a better mood today (I have a feeling that a slight monthly hormone imbalance was wreaking havoc on my brain yesterday).  However, I am sicker today with some kind of annoying cold/cough thing.  I told it to wait for two weeks until I have a long weekend to pay attention to it, but it didn't listen and decided to descend upon me immediately.  I do not appreciate my instructions being ignored, but I don't seem to have much power over this one.  You can't win them all I guess.  I decided to chastise my body by cutting my bangs this morning.  I have a tendency of cutting my bangs when I am fairly irrational and overly tired, and it is something that I am working on, but not succeeding at, avoiding.  Luckily, my scissors took pity on me and didn't allow me to mangle myself too much.    Can you tell I am under the influence of high-alcohol content cold medication?  Amazing what two teaspoons every four hours will do to you.  Hope everyone is having a good day.

      I always liked the Counting Crows a lot.  Today, my life can be summed up using a quote from  Round Here :  "She says, 'I'm sick and tired of life' - Well, everyone is tired of something."  I am sick (even to the point of running a fever) and tired (of dealing with everyone else's junk).  Help.

      Okay, more topics from class that have been making me think way too much.  I have to credit my Professor, who I still have a huge crush on, with depressing me last night.  But he also gave me a thesaurus, which I really like.  We were talking last night about Machiavelli's  The Prince .  Machiavelli feels that in order to rule you must be good at one thing - war.  I have a huge problem with that.  What if you are good at peacekeeping?  Wouldn't that keep you out of a lot more trouble than being good at war?    He says that in order to have good laws, you must have good arms, and if you have good arms, then you will have good laws.  That doesn't make sense to me.  Why must you have punishment to keep people in line?  Why can't people do things because they are the right thing to do, rather than not do things out of fear of punishment?    Before class ended, we spoke incredibly briefly about Machiavelli's notion that the only principality that works well on its own is one of religion.  I have to say that I agree with Machiavelli that a society in which religion is the focus will run itself well, because if you feel that there is a "watcher" who you can never hide from, then you won't break the law.  But, I still feel that people should, and hopefully do, act out of concern for what is right and good rather than from fear of punishment.  Maybe it is a hard level to strive for, and if we can't reach it, it is better to act from fear than nothing else.  But I like to think that people do strive to do the right thing because it is right.

      There is some kind of weird aura around me that apparently inspires people to give me things.  I am not really sure what it is about me that makes people decide randomly to add to my collection of belongings.    I am the kind of person who is not so comfortable being given things by people that I don't know that well, or even people that I do know well.  I feel like I do fairly well for myself, and if I need something, Thank G-d, I can usually buy it for myself or else I decide that I don't really need it.  My parents are always wanting to buy me stuff, dates that I go on give or buy me stuff.  My professor has now decided to give me books.  Maybe it is because I am not the type to ask for things from others on a regular basis.  I don't know.    Other people I talk to can not relate to this, everyone seems to think it is kind of weird.  But I go through life, and people give me clothes, CDs, flowers, books, knick knacks, candles, etc.    I am not complaining, on the contrary I am flattered that someone would think enough about me to want to give me something.  I only hope that they are not doing it out of my seeming to need things or value objects.  I don't think that is the case.    I would love to know if there is anyone out there who has this same experience.  I hope I am not completely unique in this.  Anyone?

      Okay, I want to blog about my trip to Atlanta a bit, because some interesting stuff happened while I was there.  First of all, it was so nice to see all of my old friends.  I really miss them.  While there, I felt extremely fortunate to know that I have friends in different places, that I am welcomed in more than one city.    My hosts, who are very close friends of mine, were absolutely wonderful.  They made me feel incredibly comfortable and it was great to catch up with them and to get to sit and really spend time with them.  They really care about others and it shines through.  Friday night, an older woman who I have a real kesher with came for dinner.  She is really such a special lady, and even with the separation of years between us, I feel we have a lot in common.  It was interesting, she was widowed quite a few years ago, and she was talking about the fact that she would still like to find someone to share her life with, and how difficult that is, because people don't think about her as "single."  She was saying that it would be nice to even have a single female friend that she could spend time with, because all of her friends are married and can't just get up and go without worrying about their spouses the way she can.  What she was saying sounded very familiar to me.  It is essentially why I left Atlanta in the first place, so I could really empathize with her.   The other really interesting thing that happened was that my roommate from college came to see me.  We had not seen in each other in over five years, and just recently got in touch with other after a very long interval of non-communication.  We come from extremely different backgrounds.  She grew up in a trailer in rural Alabama.  Her family does value education very much, and she is currently working on her Master's degree.  She lives in a trailer park with her two cats, she has a boyfriend who is in his 50's and she works for a fishing magazine.  I am not sure if I realized in college how different the two of us are, but I realized it this time around.  I could tell from things that she and her boyfriend said that our college years were ones that she looks back on with a lot of pride, while for me those years were the most miserable of my life and I have gone way uphill since then.  She told me how much she wanted me to see her trailer and cats and her life in Montgomery.  I responded honestly that I did not see it happening anytime soon, that the time I spend in Alabama these days is almost completely nonexistent.  It was interesting to see how two people whose lives connected for a short period of time, could separate so much from each other.  I have to say I am glad that I am in my shoes rather than hers.

      The topic of potential has come up and I have a few thoughts on it.  I guess the big question is whether we are obligated to fulfill our potential or not.    I feel like if I followed the direction that my potential leads, I would end up in a field that I care extremely little about.  Just because I am good at something doesn't necessarily mean that I enjoy it.    But is it fair to have talents that we don't make the most of?  And what about people who have so many talents, and unlimited potential, how can they possibly fulfill everything opportunity that they have open to them?  I guess I want it both ways, I want to be able to use what I have to the best of my abilities but I want to enjoy doing it.  And I don't know if those go together.    I have a real talent for math.  But I don't enjoy it the way that I enjoy so many other things.  So I have turned away from calculus and engineering and being an actuary, because I can't handle the thought of devoting my life to something so clear-cut and dry.  But I have come to love literature, even though I don't feel like I could go as far in that field and I don't think I have as much innate talent for it.    So do I go for what my potential dictates or my passion?

      I started writing about Plato's Crito last night.  I am having a lot of trouble with the idea that unwise equals evil.  In the dialogue Crito, Socrates asserts that “the opinions of the wise are good, and the opinions of the unwise are evil,” to which Crito agrees.  First, why must the opinions of wise people be good?  I think we need to first determine who is considered a wise person.  A wise person, according to Socrates, is “one man who has understanding” in a certain area of knowledge.  This understanding seems to be a comprehensive collection of insight into a specific area, to the point where a population would acknowledge this person as an expert.  This person would be trusted to give advice and guidance in his specific area of knowledge.  According to Socrates, this person alone should be turned to, and we should disregard the advice of any others who try to lead us in that area.  It is assumed that a person with this vast breadth of knowledge in a specific area will lead wisely; they will only give instruction that will yield the greatest benefit and help people develop themselves in this particular area of expertise.    But is the unwise necessarily evil?  Could it not be simply ignorant?  I feel like someone who is unwise does not definitely do everything bad, they could very often make the right decisions by accident, and things could turn out for the best.  Even if being unwise means being absolutely devoid of any knowledge whatsoever, I still feel that an unwise person could make some right decisions by chance.  The word evil has a sinister tone to it, as if the doer of evil is purposely giving advice that will cause others to be harmed.  Unwise does not seem to have the same negative connotation, it just indicates a lack of understanding of a particular area.  So what is the connection between wisdom and good and evil?  I think what Plato is trying to imply is that if you want to be led in the correct direction, without the chance of harm, then you must pick a person to lead who is renowned for his knowledge, who has little chance of leading you astray.  Why takes chances when you are listening to another’s guidance?  Socrates seems to feel that listening to one person who is acknowledged to be the wisest in a certain area certainly is much safer than listening to a crowd whose knowledge is questionable.

      Have been reading more of  urlLink The Twelfth Night  by Shakespeare.    The more of Shakespeare I read, the more I wonder about  urlLink his life .  I am sure there is  urlLink a lot    urlLink of information   urlLink out there   urlLink about Shakespeare   urlLink and his life , but I feel like a lot of it is a  urlLink lot of speculation .  The truth is, I find his plays, even the comedies, sad.  So many of the characters is his plays are pretending to be someone they are not.  So many feel the need to deceive, to trick, to kill.  Love is complex, often causing tons of pain and doubt.    The thing that I find scary is, I feel like Shakespeare really did have insight.  Maybe he was exaggerating real life, because that was what sold plays, but I feel like he based his plays on something real.  Maybe the simple, everyday love of marriage and friendship wasn't interesting enough to write about, maybe that is still the problem with what we see on television and in the movies.  Maybe we want to lose ourselves in stories that we feel we can never be a part of.    Because I sure wouldn't want the life of any of Shakespeare's characters.  Even the characters who fall madly in love with each other at first sight - I don't believe that passion like that leads to a couple being happy, look where it got Romeo and Juliet.  But again, I guess meeting someone, finding that you respect them for many reasons and deciding to make them a permanent part of your life doesn't sell.  So I guess my point is, while passion is something that a lot of people hope for, I think I would rather forgo passion for trust and security in the people who surround me.

      I have the day off and don't feel like thinking too hard, so no book reviews for me today.   I have been playing with the colors on my blog, and I know that they look pretty bad right now, but I have been having fun.  Thanks to  urlLink Josh  for giving me a quick tutorial on what the color codes mean.  As good Jews are wont to do, I had chinese food and went to the movies last night.  I went to see the movie  urlLink Mona Lisa Smile .  I enjoyed it, though I wish movies would learn to be a little less predictable.  I found the premise interesting.  A happy-to-be single female professor in the mid-50's teaching at an all-girl's college ( urlLink Wellesley ) and the challenge of letting girls know that there is a life beyond marriage.  Hmm, something to think about, maybe.  In other news, my apartment is becoming so pretty and clean, it looks almost new.  I am in the middle of making challah, which I just love.  I begged my friends to let me make it for Shabbos dinner, I guess I was feeling the need to take out my frustrations on some flour, water and yeast.  No really, I just really enjoy putting effort into something that turns out so pretty and yummy.   Have a good Shabbos!

      I started reading  urlLink William Shakespeare's   urlLink The Twelfth Night .  Shakespeare has an uncanny way of making the most profound thoughts come from the most unlikely of characters.  In Act 1, Scene 5, the Clown says:  Two faults, madonna, that drink and good  counsel will amend.  For give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry. Bid the dishonest man mend himself: if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything that's mended is but patched; virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but patched with virtue.  I guess you could apply this formula to almost anything.  Give a person what they are missing and they are no longer what they were before.  When reading  urlLink Othello , we talked about whether you can really know another person, maybe the answer is that you can't because they are always evolving and changing.  And if you define someone by what he does or doesn't have, and that status changes, then all balance seems to go.  Like a poor person who wins the lottery, are they going to be the same person after gaining all that money?  It depends on how important the lack of money is to the definition of that person.    It amazes me how much Shakespeare seemed to know about people.

      I had a debate with someone the other night about the existence of G-d.  I felt that neither of our arguments were especially convincing, and this was very discouraging.  So I decided to do some research on good arguments for the existence of G-d.  So, I decided to read  urlLink Permission to Believe  by  urlLink Rabbi Lawrence Keleman .    Rabbi Keleman offers four rational arguments for the existence of G-d.  He starts out simple and gets more complex, but even with the more complex of his arguments, he writes in a very clear, straight-forward way that makes his arguments accessible to anyone who is reading.  Just to extremely briefly summarize the four arguments:  Rabbi Keleman's first argument is that no person can possibly know everything that there is in the universe, so no person can possibly rule anything out of existence either.  Therefore, no person can rule out the existence of G-d.  His second argument is that if we accept certain moral obligations as being absolute, then G-d must exist because there is no human or group of humans that could have been chosen over time to decide what is right or wrong, because then it would be arbitrary and the morals would change over time.  His third argument is that by mathematical proof, scientists have found that the universe is expanding.  If the universe is expanding, then it must have started expanding at some point, and therefore, there must have been a beginning to the universe, which necessitates a Creator.    His final argument is that the mathematical chance of the universe coming to an existence in the form that it has is so infinitesimally small that it is ridiculous to have any kind of faith that it could occur.  His arguments makes more sense than my synopsis of them, so please read the book for yourself.  It is a quick, easy and eye-opening book, and I recommend it highly.  Next on my reading list:   urlLink Dr. Gerald Schroeder's   urlLink Genesis and the Big Bang   Rabbi Keleman's  urlLink Permission to Receive

      I read  urlLink Plato's Crito  last night.  It is definitely an interesting commentary on justice and the role that law has in society.  Breif summary: Socrates is awaiting his death in prison.  One of his followers, Crito, comes to him and pleads with him to make an escape.  Crito explains that money has been raised and the appropriate people will be bribed, and Socrates can escape to a place where others have been set up to make sure he is not discovered.    Socrates refuses to escape.  His argument is that by not adhering to the law that is now demanding his death, he is denying the attributes, such as his birth and education, that he has been given under that law.  I have to say that I admire Socrates' refusal to save his own life in order to uphold the principles for which he has always stood.

      I had a friend come visit me this weekend.  We met six and a half years ago in Israel.  We hadn't seen each other since, had kept up primarily through periodic phone calls.  It was so interesting, because we got along great, but in a lot of ways, I felt like I was meeting a completely new person.  There was so much I had never known about her, and I was really impressed.  There are so many dimensions to a person that it really takes major quality time to find out about.    She was really interested in a lot of the things that I have been learning about recently.  She told me she had minored in philosophy in college, I never had any idea.  She kept picking up the books that I have been reading, that all my friends have been making fun of me for reading, and she was really into them.  We had some really deep discussions this weekend about our views on religion, people and what is right.    I felt I could be really honest with her about the questions I have been thinking about lately.  We really talked things out, not that we came to any major conclusions, but it gave me a lot to think about.  I feel like I am going to be thinking about a lot of stuff for a long time.  It was good to get together with someone who isn't part of what has become my normal, extremely homogenous world.  I really like hearing other viewpoints and perspectives.  I feel like it makes me into a more well-rounded person.

      I got my first official grade from this past semester, and it is an A.  Yea!  Hard work paying off.  I also got these comments from my professor:   You are an enthusiastic, clear, concise, and penetrating thinker, and I am certain that you will greatly succeed in whatever you choose to do. You'll be a great student without even trying, though I know you'll try anyway. Don't ever sell yourself short. Know who and what you are now, and when you know who you want to be, aim for that.   I have to admit, that made me feel very good.  Tonight is  urlLink Chanukah .  I have to admit that I love seeing all the flames burning, they are really pretty.  But it is more than that, I think.  Chanukah is a holiday that we always celebrated growing up, and the majority of Jews still celebrate.  Maybe it is because it is around the same time as other holidays and parents don't want their children to feel left out.  But to me, even though it is not such a big holiday religiously, it means a lot that so many Jews are celebrating the holiday.  It is what the holiday is all about, the tenacity of the Jews, even when they are being ravaged by other nations, they stick together and stand out from the crowd.  It really is a beautiful message and I hope that even those Jews who celebrate Chanukah with a menorah alongside a tree will continue to hold onto that special spark that resides within each of us.  Happy Chanukah!

      One of the questions on my exam this past week was:  Must one believe in the Christian God to accept the rights claimed in the  Declaration of Independence ? Why or why not?  My answer was (I know it is a bit clumsy, but I was at the end of my brain cells while I was writing the answer):   The Declaration of Independence  states, “all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” At the end of  The Declaration  there is mention of a “Supreme Judge of the world,” and “the Protection of Divine Providence.” While these phrases imply that a person owes his life to a higher being, I don’t think it necessitates a Christian God. I think that someone who believes in a Jewish God or Muslim God or Hindu God, as long as they believe that their God embodies the above-mentioned characteristics, can accept those rights. I also think that it does not necessitate a belief in a God of any religion at all. I think that even an atheist can accept the rights claimed in  The Declaration of Independence . I believe that as long as a person accepts the words of  The Declaration  in a generic sense, he can accept the rights they declare. If a person agrees that each man is created equal, and he is willing to fight to secure the rights of “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness” for every person, then I don’t think he has to believe in a God. I feel that as long as a person accepts that there should be justice for all and a protection of the unalienable rights mentioned in  The Declaration , and again he is willing to fight so that every person can take full advantage of justice and protection, then he does not have to believe in any God to accept those rights himself. I think that any person who believes that all men should have the right to make a life for himself without having to answer to a tyrant can lay claim the rights mentioned in  The Declaration of Independence .

      I spent the weekend writing a paper on the book  urlLink  Emotional Intelligence   by  urlLink Dr. Daniel Goleman .  Goleman describes emotional intelligence as having the qualities of empathy, impulse control and optimism.  He goes into detail about how these traits can greatly influence a person's success in life, and can be a greater determination of that success than intelligence.  I found the book to be interesting, but I felt that it didn't offer much in the way of constructive suggestions on how to better your life.  I felt that it spoke well about the attributes of a person high or low in emotional intelligence, but it didn't give the reader a way to assess where they currently stood or how they could grow.  Maybe this is due to the fact that emotional intelligence is largely a qualitative rather than quantitative characteristic.    I felt that emotional intelligence could be summed up fairly well by describing someone who is likeable - a person who gets along well with others, looks on the bright side of things, and is a generally happy, well-adjusted individual.  While I definitely agree that these are an extremely important part of being successful in life, I think that changing these attributes in yourself would take more work than the average individual would care to put in.  Especially someone who is inherently low in the characteristics already.   Anyway, that is the gist of my paper, now I just have to get through my final tonight and I will be done with Interpersonal Relationships!

      I just read a very interesting dvar Torah for this week's parsha at  urlLink Aish.com .  School is almost over for the semester - what a ride it has been!  I had no idea that one semester would make such a difference in my life.  In the matter of sixteen weeks, I feel like I have learned an innumerable amount about statistics, literature, human nature, personality types, and oh yeah, myself too.  I am proud of the fact that it looks like I will receive A's in all of my classes.  I am more proud of the fact that I really feel like I have earned those A's, that I have worked extremely hard for once in my life and gained so much from the effort I have put in.   I feel like this semester has made me a better thinker and writer.  I think it has taught me to critically question the world around me and the things that we are asked to take for granted.  It has taught me that there are so many different people out there, but at heart, we have so much in common, and those things in common have not changed over generations and generations.  I feel like a whole new world has been opened to me, and I think I am, in many ways, a new person because of it.    I have decided that it is good to expose yourself to new thoughts and perspectives.  In doing so, I believe your own views and beliefs can be reinforced and enhanced in so many ways.  I thank Hashem for teaching me so many lessons this semester, inside the classroom and out.

      I want to say before posting this that these are my thoughts and that no one should take them as any kind of halachic statement or formal Judaic stance.  I know that my understanding of Torah is at best shallow and I hope that I am not misrepresenting it too badly, but I don't want anyone to take my word for anything more than my opinion.  The statement from yesterday was:   If G-d does things because they are good, then G-d answers to a higher power (the Good). But if G-d decides what is good, then it is arbitrary (whatever G-d says IS good, no matter what you think about it or your reason tells you or your experience reveals).   My reply was:   We know that everything that G-d does or commands us to do is for our good, whether we understand the reasoning and meaning behind it or not. I don’t think we can rely on our reason and experience to tell us what is good, because everyone has different experiences and sees things in different ways. For example, take stealing. Say a person walks into a store, takes an item off the shelf and walks out without paying for it. The person does not get caught, nothing bad happens to him. He ends up with a free item. Sounds like stealing is good. But if you look at it from the perspective of the storeowner, he has been deprived of the income that item would have generated and if it happens on a large scale, he will go out of business. So, if we decide from our experiences what is good, then good is relative and no one ends up gaining anything. So we have to rely on G-d to tell us what is good.   Is what is good arbitrary? In Jewish tradition, there are certain things that we are commanded to do that we accept without questioning. These commandments are called chukim. We can come up with logical reasons for these commandment, but we admit that we do not know the actual reasons behind them. An example of this is the prohibition between wearing garments with both wool and linen in them. We have no idea why G-d tells us not wear this combination of fibers, but we know that there must be some reason for it or the rule would not be there. And we know that the reason is for the good of those who follow the rule.   So does G-d have to answer to a higher power, that of the Good? If all acts that G-d does or commandments that He gives us are good, and can’t possibly be bad, then aren’t we limiting G-d? Maybe it is a matter of choice. G-d could choose to do that which is bad, but He doesn’t because He loves us and only wants the best for us.   Another possible answer is that G-d’s universe is quite different from ours. I was looking in a book called  The Way of G-d  by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato. The book says that one of the things we must accept about G-d is His simplicity. There is no way for us to understand the world as G-d does. It is out of our conception. Maybe in G-d’s world, there is no bad. There is not even a capacity for it. The only thing is good, therefore G-d is not bound by anything in His world, He only works with what he has, which is good.   I would love to hear anyone else's thoughts on this, I am not completely satisfied with my response but am having a hard time grappling with the question.

      I was given this statement to think about today:  If God does things because they are good, then God answers to a higher power (the Good). But if God decides what is good, then it is arbitrary (whatever God says IS good, no matter what you think about it or your reason tells you or your experience reveals).  I have some thoughts about it, but I need to form them better before I write them down.  Any thoughts out there?  E-mail me and let me know.

      Ok, so today is my birthday and I am definitely one year older, and hopefully I have grown a bit this past year as well.  Some things that I have learned in the past year:  - You never know what is going to happen.  Life likes to smack you in the face at times and remind you that you are not in charge, so don't try to act like you are.    - Having good friends really makes a difference in your life.  I cannot count how many times in the past year my friends have been there for me and I am not sure I could have handled the past year without them.  - Never look down on or dismiss anyone.  You can learn major lessons from every person you encounter if you keep an open mind.  - Go for what you want.  If you find that you love something, attach yourself to it with all your might.  - It might take a lot of effort to reach a goal, but when you put in the effort, it is so worth it in the end.    It is interesting, I was thinking about where I was in life 10 years ago (high school) and I realized that even if I had tried, I couldn't have guessed where I would be today.  My life has taken such a huge turn, back then I didn't even know what the word halacha meant.  I think I thought I was going to be an engineer, probably living in Alabama.  Weird.  Then I thought about my life one year ago today.  Even one year ago I thought my life today would be quite a bit different.  I thought I would be living somewhere else, married to someone who is no longer a part of my life.  I didn't think I would be in school, loving every second of it, now dreaming of possibly getting a Ph.D.    It is amazing what time does to a person.  I was talking to a person who has become one of my close friends yesterday and she was saying that a year ago she didn't even like me.  I hope I am being honest with myself when I say that I really think I am more mature, more self-confident and a more open-minded person than I was last year.  Anyway, happy birthday to me!

      I had a sense of accomplishment about a few things yesterday and I wanted to share them.  I had an appointment yesterday to discuss the paper I have been working on with my professor, who also happens to be a writing tutor.  He went over it with me, and pronounced that he couldn't help me with it, that I might as well turn it in as it was, it was an A paper.  He asked me to e-mail it to him so that he could read it again, and he sent me the following e-mail:  "I'm sorry if my feedback wasn't helpful about your paper; it really is a wonderful, interesting, well-written paper. And thank you for the copy; I want to read it a few more times and think about it. Do you mind if I leave comments on it and send it back?"  I have to admit that it felt really good to get such positive feedback about something I worked really hard on. We also sat and talked about what I want to do with my life.  He suggested that I go to law or medical school, neither of which I have any interest in, but my new consideration for grad school is the school that my professor actually attended,  urlLink St. John's College .  It has a very unique teaching style, and from hearing about it from a couple of people, I really think I would love it.  Of course, the degree you get from St. John's leads inevitably to teaching, but I think I could handle that.  I might even decide to go for a Ph.D., you never know.  My next accomplishment was that I baked a batch of challah last night and it smelled so good and looked so pretty when it was done.  I don't know what it is about homemade challah, but it is such a cool feeling to take a few eggs, some flour and yeast and mix them together; beat out your frustrations kneading the dough; and end up with this incredible smelling, beautiful challah that is all kavod Shabbos kodesh.  I really love making challah and I need to start doing it more often.  I decided yesterday that I am going to, bli neder, try to focus this blog on positive thoughts rather than griping at the world.  Sometimes it is good to get my frustrations out, but I am going to try my best not to do it in this forum.  I want this blog to be a outlet for improving my writing skills and expressing the thoughts that I think are interesting and enlightening about life.  Good luck to me!  Last note.  It is snowing!  This is actually the same day that it first snowed last year.  I have to say it is very pretty.  And a guy in my court actually helped me clear off my car this morning, it was really nice of him, and I really appreciated it.  Have a good Shabbos everyone!

      In class last night, we spoke about the differences between science and philosophy.  The truth is, when you look at it, the focus of science and philosophy is the same - both strive to find answers to questions in order to benefit and improve society.  I thought it was interesting.  Oh, here's a quote that I really liked -   "I know that Hashem wouldn't give me anything I can't handle, but sometimes I wish He wouldn't trust me this much."  By the way, if anyone knows how I can legally get money to attend school full-time and not have to work, I would love to hear about it.

      I have been working on a paper based on a excerpt from Plato's  urlLink  Republic   (The excerpt I have been working from is the beginning of Book 7).  The excerpt I have been using is a parable about people being chained inside a cave, seeing only shadows and believing the shadows to be real life.  These people get used to looking at the shadows, identifying the shadows and using the shadows to predict what will next occur.  Plato then goes on to describe someone being unchained and taken from the cave into the real world, now being exposed to the sunlight and the real world.  This person's eyes take quite a bit of time to adjust, and at first it is painful.  After the adjustment takes place, the person then comes to realize the beauty of the world around him, and begins to see what he has been missing.    This story is a parable for the process of education.  (The exact nature of the education is a source of debate that my paper focuses on.)  The impact of this education is such that a person who has been educated typically reacts in a variance of ways.  Some people use their knowledge for evil.  Some decide to sequester themselves away and focus on their education exclusively and choose to block the uneducated from their lives, drawing a very tight circle around themselves.    And some reach a high level and see the education for the incredible good it can do, and are subsequently forced to go back down into the cave to use their education to help those who are stilled chained.  They become the leaders of society, albeit reluctant leaders, which Plato posits are the best kind.  As Plato says, they are the best leaders because they "are truly rich, not in silver and gold, but in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of life."  The reason that these people who are reluctant to lead will do so anyway is because they will understand that they have a responsibility to share the knowledge and wisdom that they have been fortunate enough to have been given (Sorry, I know that was an awkward sentence).  Reading this parable (over and over and over), I was struck several times by how relevant this story was to my life in becoming a baal teshuvah.  The exposure to the outside world being the exposure to Torah.  I see a lot of parallels in the fact that this exposure did at first cause a lot of pain, but after some adjustment (and I am still adjusting), I have to say that it enriched my life remarkably.  And while I don't aspire to be any kind of leader, the introduction of Torah into my life definitely came with a lot of responsibility.  The responsibility of treating others correctly, of following mitzvos, of being a kiddush Hashem in my daily interactions.    I feel like it would be a waste to take that knowledge and never have anything to do with those who don't also share the knowledge.  I think it is important to see how that knowledge can fit in with the world around us.  How it can work with, rather than against, and hopefully benefit, others who have not been so "enlightened."  It amazes me how much insight Plato had.  I think those who believe that humans are getting more advanced as time goes on show how little they know.

      Okay, have to do this every once in a while to clear out some of the random things that have been going through my head.  - I know I am biased, but I have to say that one of the cutest sights I get to encounter on a regular basis is my cat curled up on my lap, trying to take the attention away from whatever I am reading.  If I think my cat is this cute, I just don't know how I am going to be able to handle having a baby.  - I need to get more focus while I am driving.  Twice in two weeks now I have hit stationery objects, and while I thankfully don't care so much about the dents and scrapes that my car is acquiring, the person whose car I scraped last night might have more feeling about it.  Haven't heard from them, but I don't think I am in the clear yet.  - I was talking to a very close friend of mine last night.  I feel like she might have been in an unusually argumentative mood, but she was trying to convince me that when I find a guy that "can put the kids to sleep at night," that he is the guy I should marry.  Forget about intellectual stimulation, I can get that elsewhere.  I don't know if she has been spending too many hours with babies or what, but I corrected her and told her that, no, I  need  to know that my husband is capable of higher-level, abstract thinking.  While I understand that not every conversation we have will be on a lofty, philosophical level, I want to know that my husband has the capacity for it, or else I might really have trouble looking up to him.    - I was reading "The Apology" by Plato last night, the transcript of the defense that Socrates gave when on trial in Athens.  I have to say that Socrates was quite bold, he actually attacked his accusers from the stand.  I think the piece might be a bit inaccurately titled.  But I found this line that I loved: "Life without enquiry is not worth living."  I have a lot of respect for Socrates in this piece, with his life on the line, he absolutely refused to back down from what he believed in.  I think it took a lot of courage.  It reminds me of Rabbi Akiva and the many Jewish martyrs throughout history who would not abandon their faith in the face of death.  - I noticed a large gash on my arm that I have absolutely no recollection of inflicting upon myself.  Will I ever manage to grow out of this five-year-old boy habit of coming home scraped and bruised?  - Finally, the word for the day is "BRRRR."  It is so cold out and I hate it!  And the word snow has been tossed around for the weekend.  Here's my  urlLink forecast.   Hope yours is balmier than mine.

      I thought I would expound upon why I hate dating so much.  So you know what a girl has to go through every time she goes on a date...  The first dilemma is what to wear.  Have to find the right combination of tznius but flattering, make sure your collar bone is covered, but you want to look attractive and show off your assets at the same time.  And make sure whatever you wear is a good compliment for the activity that you will be participating in.  Each date has a different level of formality: first date you have to get really dressed up, next date a little more casual, each date after that according to what you are doing, or how comfortable you are with the person.  The next dilemma is hair and makeup.  You want to look nice, but not overdo it.  Many girls get their hair straightened for each date - I say forget that!  Way too much effort, and I like my hair curly.  I hate excessive make-up, try to go for a nice look that says I have put in a bit of time, but don't want to look like Michael Jackson or anything.  Then you have to run around your apartment fifty times, bothering your roommate about whether you look good or not.  She will give you suggestions, tell you that you look fine, and roll her eyes over and over.    Then you sit and wait for the guy to arrive.  I usually spend those moments nauseous, wanting to do anything but go on the date.  I try to distract myself reading something or bothering my roommate some more, but it usually does not take my mind off the impending date at all.    Then the doorbell rings.  You open the door, the guy always looks you up and down (hate that part!).  You try to act like you didn't feel like throwing up five minutes ago, and you make small talk as you walk to his car.    The rest of the date is usually pretty boring.  You try to have fun while determining if this is the person that you are going to spend the rest of your life with.  Most of the time it is like pulling teeth just to spend a few hours with the person.  You try to engage in witty conversation, half of which you don't remember five minutes later.  You try to act like you are having a good time, because you don't want to hurt the other person's feelings.   The end of the date is the worst.  Because you can't touch, the guy can't kiss you, and you can't tell from that whether he likes you or not (though the guys usually went for the kiss when they didn't like you anyway).  You never tell the person whether you want to go out again.  It makes things incredibly awkward.  And if you are like me, unless it is completely obvious, you stress about what the right decision is: do you go out again or not, is it worth it?  Do you go out one more time to make sure he is not for you, or is it even worth going through all the stress you have just gone through?  Is there potential, should you let the person have more time to grow on you, or forget it now?    Ah, the fun of shidduch dating.

      I was listening to the radio this morning on my way to work and they were talking about the Palestinian "militants" who were killed by Israeli troops yesterday.  The words "terrorist," "murderer," "hate-monger," or even the completely non-controversial "suicide bomber" were never used.    The "news"caster went on the talk about how the Al Aqsa Martyr's Brigade and Hamas were both claiming responsibility for the murderous bus bombing that happened yesterday.  Imagine that, two organizations fighting over who gets responsibility for being blood-thirsty murderers and no one even bats an eyelash.  The report went on to speak about the fact that Israel exchanged 400 Palestinian terrorists (of course that word wasn't used, I think it was prisoners) for 1 Israeli businessman and 3 bodies of Israelis that the Palestinians killed.  The report concluded with the sad news that Israel had killed four Palestinians who were carrying explosives towards one of the Israeli settlements.  The fact that one of these Palestinians was only the tender age of 17 was noted as the final sentence of the report.  Was there any mention of the 10 Israelis civilian who were going about their normal day-to-day lives yesterdays, riding on their usual bus to work or school, when suddenly they were viciously murdered because of their nationality?  Did it mention the age of any of the victims in that attack?  Did it mention that the only weapons the bus-riders had with them was possibly a pen or maybe a purse (I know, you can get pretty violent with a purse)?  Hmmm, maybe when the reports lament the fact that civilians rather than terrorists carrying explosives are killed, there will be hope of a peaceful Israel.

      I don't have much to say today, but I just read the following quote and thought it was something to think about:  "Words plainly force and overrule the understanding, and throw all into confusion, and lead men away into numberless empty controversies and idle fancies."  --  urlLink Sir Francis Bacon ,  urlLink Novum Organum  or True Directions Concerning the Interpretation of Nature

      I need a routine.  I was so ready to get back to school and now almost the entire first week has been cancelled.  I like being so crazy busy that I can't think.  It keeps my mind away from the fact that I have no life.  Ok, sorry, had to get that out.  This weather is driving me crazy.  I get very agitated when I am counting on something and it gets cancelled or postponed.  I have had enough of winter.  I hate bundling up everytime I go outside and having to clear off my car for fifteen minutes before I can go anywhere.  Ok, a few happy thoughts.  I have decided that one of the greatest inventions ever was the little Post-It sticky arrows that I have been using to mark great passages in the books I have been reading.  Speaking of reading, I love the Odyssey.  It is such a great story, with so much richness to it.  So much more interesting than the Iliad, which was so full of war.  I feel like the Odyssey puts so much more emphasis on the value of human companionship.  The Iliad talks about "beloved companions" in regard to Achilleus and Patroklos, but the characters let their rage and pouting get in the way of taking care of each other.  The entire Odyssey is about striving to reconnect with family and friends.  The characters are constantly crying about the loss of their companions.  I just find it to be so human.  I am also reading  urlLink The Pearl  by  urlLink John Steinbeck .  I read it ages ago when I was in junior high I think.  Steinbeck's language is absolutely beautiful.  And he really describes his character's motives very interestingly.  I can't remember how it ends, I will let you know.  Okay, back to pretending like I am doing work.

      The weather outside is just yucky today.  There was a sheet of ice on my car that took my a good workout to clear off this morning.  I had no idea it took so much muscle to clear ice off a car!    I have school tonight - I am so ready to get back in the groove of things and see my friends from school and just get back into my routine.    I had a chevrusa last night.  I want to learn Hebrew and so a friend of mine is going through the Chumash with me and she is helping me translate and then we discuss as we go along also.  I am really enjoying it, but I find it really hard work!  I am learning a lot, but when I get to the end of a pasuk and translate the whole thing, I am wiped.  And when my attention is gone, forget it!  But I am really finding that it is enhancing my appreciation of the Chumash, I have a good idea of what is going on in the parsha each week and I am really learning a good bit of Hebrew.    After my chevrusa last night, I got in a snow fight with my friends.  It was so much fun to act like a kid for a few minutes and just have fun.  I really enjoyed the snow for once.

      I would just like to point out the fact that when you have a full-time job and go to school, and only one of those are cancelled when it snows (guess which one was cancelled), it is not nearly so much fun.

      I have been reading  urlLink The Odyssey  by  urlLink Homer .  It is such an incredible story.  There is so much depth in it, and the tales that are spun are so interesting.  Most of all, the interactions between the characters are really fascinating.  The language is a bit difficult to get through at times, but when you get used to it, the story just flows.  I was asked why it is that  urlLink Odysseus  wants to leave  urlLink Calypso  and go home.  I think living with Calypso is just incredibly antithesis to Odysseus' life.  Odysseus is used to being king, being glorified by those around him, being in charge of everything, and being known as a great warrior and strategist.  Living on an island with only one person who is holding him against his will has got to go against everything that he is used to.  Besides the fact that he is lonely and needs more than just one companion (even if you are with someone you love, you want some outside stimulation sometimes), he has been relegated to a place where he can't make any decisions for himself, and I think that is just so completely against his character that he doesn't know what to do with himself.  And who wants to be forced to do something anyway?  If he made the decision to be with Calypso it would be one thing, but he is being held captive, and no one likes that.  And then of course, there is his wife and child at home, and all his friends, who I am sure he misses.  Not having any idea what is happening to the life he left  behind 20 years ago must be incredibly hard.  Some other things that came up while I was reading:   I think the interaction between the gods and the mortals in the Odyssey is so fascinating.  I can't figure out what makes the gods godlike and the mortals mortal half the time.  The line, "A god is difficult for a mortal man to master" just blew me away.  Wow.  Do the mortals really think they can master the gods? The love  urlLink Athene  has for Odysseus and  urlLink Telemachos , the vengeance the  urlLink Poseidon  wants to place on Odysseus, it is just so human and fallible, do the mortals really take the gods seriously or do they just see them as a better-than-average mortal?.    And why does Athene have to disguise herself as other people all the time?  Are the gods not able to be seen by the mortals outside of a assumed mortal body?  The gods are blamed for evil, it says, "yet divine Zeus sometimes gives out good, sometimes evil."  Can something that a god does ever be evil?  Maybe we see it as evil, but because it comes from a god, doesn't that automatically make it good?  I feel like the tone of the Odyssey is very different from the  urlLink Iliad .  The Iliad was always talking about anger and vengeance.  The Odyssey keeps making comments about sorrow and sadness.  It talks about the loss of loved ones, and a need for friends and family.  Instead of everyone raging, they are thoughtful and even show humility and respect.  Anyway, just some impressions of mine.  I will keep updating as I get farther along - it is a long book!

      I had my visit to St. John's College in Annapolis yesterday.  I spoke with the Admissions Director, had a campus visit, sat in on some classes and met my professor's girlfriend, who is in her last semester there.  I really enjoyed the classes and felt like I would learn a lot from them as well as contribute a lot to them.  I was not allowed to contribute to the class discussion, but in both classes, students brought up questions that I had wondered about myself.  The students in the classes were serious about learning, had done the readings and were honestly endeavoring to find answers to questions about the texts.  I was impressed by the students and teachers, and I felt like I could definitely fit in there.  I had been concerned about being intimidated or put off by the intellectualness of the people there, and it was not the case.  My concerns revolve around three main issues.  The first is money.  All financial aid at St. John's is awarded on a need-based, not merit-based, system.  So it is going to be plenty expensive for me to go there.  The second issue is what to do after getting my graduate degree there.  A Masters in Liberal Arts basically qualifies a person to either go on for further education, teach at a private school, or do something completely away from the liberal arts arena all together.  I am still not sure what I want to do professionally, and I am getting to the point where it is harder and harder for me to envision my future.  I wouldn't mind going on to get my PhD, I think I could do it if I put my mind to it, but the academic job market stinks and pays extremely poorly, and it is a lot of work and debt to get there.  I better make sure it is what I really want to do before I shoot for it.  I have one other concern about attending St. John's.  I know it sounds a bit silly, but I am almost afraid to surround myself with people who are into this kind of reading and discussing.  I don't want to limit myself in the people who I associate with.  I will have to work on making sure that my interests and friendships remain broad.  Hopefully this task will not be too terribly difficult.

      I finished reading Brave New World by Aldous Huxley last night.  I have to say that I was quite disappointed with the ending.    I just want to touch on a few points that I found interesting about the book.  First, the language used was really fascinating.  Huxley has one of his characters say, "Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly - they'll go through anything."  Huxley uses phrases through his book that are just so interesting, such as "so frighteningly clever" and "awful glad" and "success went fizzily."    I also found Huxley's use of Shakespeare to be very poignant.  Contrasting a world with no emotion to the world of Shakespeare gives such a set of extremes; Huxley admits no middle ground into the book.  While the "Savage" (a name in which I find another interesting choice of word usage) was exposed to a world where emotion was experienced, he didn't seem to infuse any of it into his own life, instead choosing to fixate on Shakespeare's extreme worlds of tragedy as his example of what life is about.  I don't think anyone could successfully live in either world Huxley portrays.  Anyway, I had lots of other thoughts about the book but I am getting sick and my brain isn't working as well today as it should.

      Not too much to blog about today.  I had a chevrusa last night with a friend.  She is working with me on my Biblical Hebrew.  As someone who has never been overly interested or particularly talented in languages, I am actually having fun and feel like I am making progress.  We are going through the Chumash and she is helping me translate as we go, and then we sometimes break out to talk about some of the interesting themes (we could spend the whole night on that!) in the pasuk.  Today is a blah day.  I have very little to do at work, which always drives me crazy.  I feel like I might be coming down with a cold.  I would like to be curled up in bed, reading The Odyssey.  And my wallet is very depressed at the moment (that's what I get for balancing my checkbook).  Why is a college education such an incredibly expensive endeavor?  And why can't professors use books for courses that can be bought used?  But on the bright side, the week is half over, tomorrow is my visit to St. John's, and it is sunny out, even if it is insanely cold (today is the kind of day I don't mind being inside).  And I shared some of my thoughts about Socrates with my professor and he told me that I am "just amazing" and "um, not the average undergrad at UB."  Well, at least someone is impressed with me.  I am almost done with Brave New World, I am hoping to finish it tonight, so I should have a lot of thoughts about it tomorrow.

      I added my current favorite quote to my blog - I like it not for the genius part nearly so much as for the part about society providing molds for people.  Gives me a lot to think about.  I have a couple questions that I am pondering at the moment.  The first is something that I would love to write a paper about, though I would need to do a lot more reading first.  The second is just a life issue type of question to ponder.  1)  In  urlLink Plato 's dialogues,  urlLink Socrates  states over and over that he doesn't know anything (except for in  urlLink The Symposium , where he says that he does know about love).  He also states in  urlLink Crito  that the unwise is evil (and this thought is echoed by  urlLink Aristotle  in  urlLink Nicomachean Ethics ).  But then Socrates says that he is wise because he knows that he doesn't know.  Okay, so if he doesn't know anything, then how can he be wise?  Is wisdom different from having knowledge?  Can you be wise without having knowledge?  And if not knowing anything does equal being unwise, then is Socrates evil?    2)  Why does it seem that to be considered "deep," a person must also be depressed?  It seems to me that the people who are considered the deepest, heavy thinkers, are depressed and sad and that if you are happy and think that the world is good, then you are not, and can not be, considered deep.  What does it mean to be deep anyway?  My thoughts for the day.

      I hate my job.  I have to redo a huge project and it is not my fault.  Actually, I am glad that it is not my fault, but it is still a big pain.  I am in the middle of reading several books at the moment:  I have been working through  urlLink  Emma   by  urlLink Jane Austen .  I feel like I should like it because it is considered good literature, but the truth is, I am having trouble getting into it for two reasons.  First, having seen the movie  urlLink  Clueless   about 15 times, I know exactly what is going to happen in the book the minute each character is introduced.  Second, I feel like the book is just 19th century  urlLink wedding porn , which is exactly the kind of books that I have been trying to escape lately.  I just don't see any major difference between  Emma  and  urlLink  Last Chance Saloon   by  urlLink Marion Keyes .  Maybe I am wrong, but I think Jane Austen was just the beginning of a really long trend.  A friend suggested that I read  urlLink  Brave New World   by  urlLink Aldous Huxley  because she wanted to discuss it with me.  The premise is similar to  urlLink  The Giver   by  urlLink Lois Lowry , which I recently read, a utopian society that has been engineered to "perfection."  The book keeps surprising me, so I am going to wait until I finish it to post my full review.  I also started  urlLink  The Odyssey   by  urlLink Homer .  I have scheduled a visit to  urlLink St. John's College  this week to decide if I really want to go there for grad school, and I am sitting in on a class that will be discussing  The Odyssey .  I figure I will probably end up reading the whole thing, because it has been on my list anyway.  So far, I have only read the first book, but so far I am finding it easier to follow than  urlLink  The Iliad  , but I am not sure if it is because I know a lot of the characters from having read  The Iliad  or if it because I have gotten used to reading more difficult language and it is becoming more easily understandable to me.  During my visit to St. John's, I am also sitting in on a class on  urlLink Plato's  dialogue  urlLink  Meno  .  I am really looking forward to it, because I read the dialogue on my own for my class last semester but I never got a chance to discuss it and I thought it was extremely interesting.  Other than books, not much going on in my life.  I am still having major trouble my glasses and have to go back to get a new prescription.  Wish me luck!

      I have been having trouble with the idea of being intellectual lately.  Or I guess to be more exact, I have been trouble with the idea of actually being what is considered "an intellectual" but balancing that with not being elitist or a snob.  My experience growing up was that those who considered themselves "intellectuals" also considered themselves better than those around them who were not intellectuals.  They were well-read, wise, snotty and not the kind of people I enjoyed being around.  Could I match wits with them?  If I felt like it, but I didn't really want to be around those people very often so I didn't usually bother trying.  Since returning to school, I have been exposed to a new vision of the intellectual world.  I have been exposed to incredible literature and thought that I never considered before.  The fact that I really enjoy learning about these things de facto  puts me in the category of being intellectual and the truth is, I really do enjoy intellectual discourse, I love discussing philosophical ideas, and I really enjoy the mental stimulation and challenge of being a part of that world.  But I have a problem with associating myself with a group of "intellectuals" because of my past experiences with the air of superiority that people who are intellectual often put on.   There is a lot more to it, but I don't feel like expanding upon it here.  The solution suggested by someone I talked to about this problem, is in humility.  When we know first of all that there is an awful lot that we don't know, then we won't be arrogant or elitist about being intellectual.  I know that there is a ton of stuff out there that I have never even ventured to think about.  And there is stuff that I am not even capable of understanding.  I have also been taught that humility is acknowledging that everything I have, my intelligence, my wealth, my health, is a gift from Hashem.  I can't take credit for it, and therefore, what right do I have to be haughty and arrogant about it?

      I haven't been reading much the last few days for a list of reasons, but my life has been surrounded by discussions of dating, so I figured I would talk about that.  For once, it is not my dating life that has been the topic of discussion, but the dating life of my friends.  It amazes me how so many people, men and women, seem to hate shidduch dating, and yet, we all buy into it, keep going through it, and nothing seems to change.  Girls and guys both have various forms of the same complaints, yet we keep doing to each other what we hate.  No one seems to learn from their mistakes.  A lot of lip service is spoken, but what is really felt is not.    Expectations go up, get squashed.  People are rejected quickly and dismissively.  Dishonesty seems to be the policy.  If you are not a good little cookie cutter, it makes it worse.    I am not going to act like I am better than anyone else.  I haven't made any radical changes in the dating system.  I get asked advice from my friends, I try to be honest with them, but I don't want to be mean, so I let them continue to get excited even when I have a feeling the situation is not as rose-colored as they think it is.  And life goes on.  And dating goes on.

      I had a traumatic experience last night.  I went to the eye doctor for a routine visit.  It's been almost two years since I have had my eyes checked and I was almost out of  urlLink contact lenses , so I figured it was time.  I also figured that since my glasses were about eight years old and I can't see out of them, it was time for a new pair.  The doctor takes one look at my eyes and says, "Uh oh, that's not good."  I told him that was a horrible thing to say to a patient.  After he finishes looking at my eyes, he tells me that I have a problem.  Apparently I have a condition called  urlLink corneal neovascularization .  What this means in English is that I have been depriving my eyes of the natural oxygen that comes into them by not changing my contacts often enough.  Because I have been depriving my eyes of oxygen, they have formed blood vessels to carry oxygen into them on their own.  If this continues, the blood vessels will grow into my pupil and cause permanent damage.  Of course, this was totally out of left field to me, so I contacted an old friend of mine who is in  urlLink optometry school  (I am so proud of him) to make sure what this doctor was saying is for real.  My friend confirmed that this condition is for real and that I better not put contacts anywhere near my eyes until my doctor says I can.  The good news is that by wearing glasses instead of contacts for a while, I can reverse the damage that I have done to my eyes.  The bad news is that I am not used to wearing glasses, so now I am nauseous and head-achey from going to contacts to glasses without any transition.  So, I went last night and got myself a  urlLink new pair of glasses .  Amazing what they can do in an hour.  As if I hadn't entrenched myself enough in geekdom by my new intellectual pursuits, now I have the glasses to announce to the world that I am officially a four-eyed nerd.  Oh well, at least I have my eyes.  As Tom (the aspiring optometrist) put it, "You only have two eyes, you better take care of them."

      My mom came to visit me this past weekend.  It was nice spending time with her, but I find it is difficult to sustain activity for several days on end.  It is also weird to spend so much time with my mother at once.  I feel like she is such a separate part of my life that it is hard to reconcile having her be a part of my Baltimore life, which I have cultivated so differently from how my life was in Birmingham.  We had fun though.  We went to the  urlLink Baltimore Museum of Art , we  urlLink went   urlLink shopping , we saw the movie  urlLink Big Fish , which was really interesting and different from most of the movies out there - I recommend seeing it just because it isn't the same as everything else, and then we drove down to  urlLink Annapolis  and hung out.  I was a good friend and support this past weekend.  I am now drawing on my past experiences to help friends go through their current ones.    Last night I took time to just sit and read and relax.  It was really nice after a weekend of being on the go.  I needed it to recharge my batteries.  Ahhh, relaxation.

      I have been reading " urlLink On Liberty " by  urlLink John Stuart Mill .  It is really interesting considering that Mill wrote this essay during 1800's England.  His premise is that we should be able to do whatever we want as long as we don't hurt anyone else.  He bashes Christianity, the government, the people of his time and basically anyone who says that we should conform to accepted norms.  I feel like he was not especially popular with his contemporaries.  I am a bit surprised he wasn't executed.  I don't agree with everything he says, but he makes some really important points.  He says that for someone to believe in a specific issue, he should examine closely all opposition to that issue so that he can effectively argue against the opposition.  He says it is important for people to think for themselves, and do not what is customary, but what they individually believe is correct.  He states that all opinions, because they are opinions, should be heard and not deterred as long as they are not causing danger to others.  I can't sum it up as well as he says it, so here are some quotes that I like:  "People are accustomed to believe...that their feelings on subjects of this nature are better than reasons and render reasons unnecessary."  "We can never be sure that the opinion we are endeavoring to stifle is a false opinion; and if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still."  "Who can compute what the world loses in the multitude of promising intellects combined with timid characters, who dare not follow out any bold, vigorous, independent train of though, lest it should land them in something which would admit of being considered irreligious or immoral?"  "The human faculties of perception, judgment, discriminative feeling, mental activity and even moral preference are exercised only in making a choice."  "The mental and moral, like the muscular, powers are improved only by being used."  I think this is my favorite:   "Persons of genius are, by definition, more individual than any other people - less capable, consequently, of fitting themselves, without hurtful compression, into any of the small number of molds which society provides in order to save its members the trouble of forming their own character."

      Okay, one of those days when one full post just won't suffice.  On to my random musings:  You know that expression,  urlLink "Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach" ?  Well, apparently, in my case it is, "Those who can, marry.  Those who can't, give dating advice."  I am flattered that my friends trust me enough to come to me for dating advice, but really, don't you think that they would look at my miserable track record and go running in the other direction?  You would think they would go to someone who has been  urlLink successful in dating .  Like someone who has managed to build a successful relationship with someone.  I guess all those horror stories we keep sharing hasn't scared my friends away yet.  So, I keep trying to give the best advice I can, all the while worrying that maybe it is the blind leading the blind here.  I have been reading a bit of  urlLink Aristotle's   urlLink Nicomachean Ethics .  I think the Ethics can be summed up in this quote: "Human good turns out to be activity of the soul in accordance with virtue."    It is interesting because Aristotle was, at least according to the histories I have been reading, a student of  urlLink Plato's school , but their approaches are completely different.  While  urlLink Plato  goes about trying to define things by  urlLink asking tons of questions  and ruling out what something isn't, Aristotle gets to the point and tells you exactly what he thinks something is, giving names and definitions.  Aristotle's writing is dense, but at least I feel like I am getting somewhere when I am reading his stuff.    I really liked this quote:  "Both art and virtue are concerned with what is harder; for even the good is better when it is harder."  I know throughout my life, the things that I have worked the hardest for have been the sweetest successes.  The goals were much more valuable to me when I knew that I had put effort in to achieve them.  I am also reading a book of  urlLink Dostoevsky's  short stories.  All of the stories that I have read so far have been so full of sadness and loneliness.  I am not sure if  urlLink Dostoevsky himself  was really lonely, but he manages to capture a lonely soul pretty well.  Okay, enough random thoughts for today.

      Over New Year's, I read the book  urlLink  The Giver   by  urlLink Lois Lowry .  It is a book written for the "young adult" crowd, meaning 10-12 year olds, but it embodied a message that I think anyone could learn from.  The book is about a boy named Jonas who grows up in a community who enforced a doctrine of "Sameness."  In making everyone the same, they substitute emotion and free will with security.  It is an interesting trade-off.  Family units are constructed by "The Elders," spouses are assigned to each other, occupation is assigned by careful observation.  Development is carefully engineered year by year.  Death is blocked out of consciousness by the concept of "release."    No one feels emotion for anyone else.  Once you are old enough, you have your own home, your parents are no longer a part of your life.  The concept of love is completely alien.  Language is to be used precisely, though that precise language is a pale substitute for what normal human emotion is all about.  Jonas is chosen as the "Receiver of Memories."  His responsibility is to bear the memories of before "Sameness" - memories of love, fear, pleasure, pain.  He is allowed to read books, books which describe all these memories, which no one else is allowed access to.  It is a world of loneliness, because the rest of the community has no interest and no capacity to handle all these emotions.  When Jonas described feeling love for the first time, and realizing what he has been missing, it brought tears to my eyes.  I realized that even though life is hard, I wouldn't give up the pain that it brings for a world with no choices, no emotions, no real connection to others.  It is so hard to let yourself connect emotionally with another person, because there is a risk of being hurt, but in lieu of living a life like that in  The Giver , I would take it any day of the week.  So I am now determined to appreciate everything as it is given to me, the pain and pleasure, the love and hurt, the ability to feel.  And maybe I will need to re-read the book when I forget what a great treasure we do have in the capacity to choose.

      Ok, so that is probably the most popular title of he day, so much for originality.  I had a very calm New Year's Eve - watched a video with friends and we watched the ball drop at midnight.  For me, that was enough excitement.  The fact that I could spend New Year's with people whose company I enjoy brought the year in positively for me.    I wish a year filled with happiness for everyone!

      If you ever want to get upset about the treatment of women, read some classical philosophy.  So many of the philosophers tend to discard women as not being capable of rational thought, intellect or virtue.  I have been reading  urlLink Aristotle's   urlLink Politics .  Aristotle sees women on a level slightly above that of a natural slave but far below that of a free man.  What actually constitutes a natural slave and a free man is up to a lot of discussion, but let's suffice it to say that women are not seen as especially worthy in Aristotle's eyes.  Aristotle is not the only one who makes comments about women being incapable of the same complexities as men.   urlLink Plato , in the  urlLink Symposium , makes broad statements about women being incapable of deep love, and  urlLink Michel De Montaigne , in  urlLink Of Friendship , states that women are unable to participate in a true friendship.  What kind of relationships must these men have had with their wives?  They all had wives, but didn't seem to think a whole lot of them.  I have to wonder if they ever discussed what they were writing with their wives, or whether their marriages were merely for the purpose of procreation, that their wives were only seen in the bedroom, and not spoken to very much at that time.  I have to believe that women were just as intelligent and capable as they are now, and I wonder that they were kept down so much as to not be able to convey their worth to the men whose homes they shared.  I was discussing this last night with someone, and he made a comment to me about how maybe I should be looking closer to home about the way women are viewed, implying of course, the way that women are viewed in the Orthodox Jewish world.  I told him that it is misunderstood, and we kind of left it at that.  The truth is, as much justification as can be given to a lot of the issues the outside world sees with how women are viewed in Judaism, there is a lot that goes beyond what is acceptable to me.  I don't consider myself a feminist, I don't have trouble not being counted in a minyan or sitting on the other side of a mechitza.  I am not asking to read from the Torah, nor am I even complaining about having to wear skirts in the winter and long sleeves in the summer.  What I do have a problem with is those who say that a woman's place is strictly in the home, that a man's education (Jewish and otherwise) is necessarily more important than a woman's, that a man should not be asked to do "women's work" such as laundry or dishes.  I have heard all of these things justified within a supposedly halachic framework.  It seems that the father right one goes, the more disparity there is between women's and men's roles in life.  While I don't think that men and women are the same, should be treated identically, or even want the same things out of life, I think that a woman should be given the opportunity to find what fulfills her, be it the pursuit of a job or the choice to stay home with her children.  I just don't think she should be bound to one path as the only acceptable way of life.  I think women have so much to offer the world, and luckily, I think the world in general does recognize that today.  I hope that in that way, the world has changed from the time when Aristotle was writing.  I hope that whatever I decide to do with my life, whether I decide to stay at home with my children or go on to get my PhD, I can be supported in that endeavor by men and women, Jewish and non-Jewish.  And I hope that other women out there feel able to do the same.

      I have been thinking a lot lately about the "older" singles that I know, in particular the girls (mainly because I don't know that many guys).  I can't even begin to explain where the cut off for when you become "older," so I am just going to assume it begins around 24 or 25.  A lot of people would probably argue that it is younger, but I think it is absolutely ridiculous to say that a 23-year-old who is not married is old, so you are just going to have to deal with my personal bias on that one.  What I see when I look at the older single girls is a mix of two things.  The first group of older single girls are professional, bright, independent, attractive and personable.  They have gone out into the world, have made a life for themselves, are improving themselves and those around them daily.  They look forward to getting married, but they don't allow the fact that they are not married steop them from making a life for themselves.  The second group doesn't necessarily lack the above qualities, but they seem to embody one extra attribute - that is aura of "waiting."  These girls are "waiting" for marriage.  They are waiting to move out of their parents' houses, waiting to begin the next stage of their life, waiting to have a baby, always waiting.   A lot of those in the second group talk about their high school days as the halcyon years, their friendships haven't moved much beyond that time, even though they are now ten years or more older.  The only thing I can figure out is, they expected to be married shortly after high school, and then they would start their "real" lives as a part of a family.  So the fact that they have not yet gotten married has caused them to stop in mid-air and run in place.  I did the waiting thing for a few years.  Then I realized that I couldn't wait forever to fulfill my dreams.  I couldn't wait for things to fall into place (until I got married) to go back to school, to make a life for myself.  I realized that maybe the vision of my future isn't what is going to happen.  I had to move on and start carving out a different future.  I am no longer waiting to get married before I do things in my life.  This doesn't mean I want to get married less than those other girls, it simply means that I realize that I don't want to put my entire life on hold while I wait for one aspect of it to come.  I don't look down on those girls who are waiting.  Unfortunately, I think that the world they grew up in makes it extremely difficult to see life as whole during that period after high school and before marriage.  I hope that they can find in themselves that they are whole with or without a husband.

      I started reading  urlLink Aristotle's   urlLink Politics  last night.  I haven't gotten very far, but what I read was a bit disturbing.  Aristotle says that some people are born to be slaves and some people are born to be masters.  And of course, he seems to think the class he belongs to is the class of masters.  Ok, I have problems with that.  I e-mailed my professor, who sent me the piece I was reading, and told him about my trouble.  He told me to "think beyond the obvious."  He suggested that I look closer at what Aristotle means by slavery, and "natural slaves."    Aristotle says, "He who participates in rational principle enough to apprehend, but not to have, such a principle, is a slave by nature."  But I am not so sure how you "have" rational principle.  So that didn't help so much.  He also speaks about the soul and the body, how the soul rules the body, and the body is the slave of the soul, at least it should be by nature.    When I try to think "beyond the obvious" idea of slaves, I have to say that most people are a slave to a large number of things, such as our bodies.  We have to eat to sustain ourselves; we need money to be able to eat; we have to work to earn the money to be able to eat; we have to get up at a certain time to be able to work to earn the money to be able to eat.  In this manner, I think we are all slaves to a certain extent, and it seems that we are slaves to our bodies.    When I think beyond our physical needs, most of us also become slaves to the people in our lives, to the other mental and physical demands on us, to our religious beliefs.  And all this is not necessarily a bad thing at all - it is, as Aristotle says, natural.    I guess the question I have left is, is there any way for a person to NOT be a slave, in any realm at all?

      I have been reading the play  urlLink Man and Superman  by  urlLink George Bernard Shaw .  I have only read the first act so far, so I have no clue how it will turn out, but for a play written at the turn of the century, I feel like the themes that are brought up are very contemporary.    One of the main characters, Jack Tanner, is the author of  urlLink "The Revolutionist's Handbook"  and he describes himself as a member of the "Idle Rich Class." His forward-thinking is not always appreciated so much by the other characters in the play.  He describes the process of growing and maturing:  "I had become a new person; and those who knew the old person laughed at me.  The only man who behaved sensibly was my tailor: he took my measure anew every time he saw me, whilst all the rest went on with their old measurements and expected them to fit me."  I think this is true for most of your casual acquaintances; they have trouble seeing you in anything but the role that they initially place you in.  When things change, when the balance of power gets tipped, when one person suddenly has taken a major step in their life, I think relationships do tend to have trouble.  I see this many times with friends who get married or have children, the relationship between two friends can change or even terminate when such a big event occurs in one's life and not the other.  But I think that there is a level of friendship to which this does not apply.  I think that for two people who really have that unique bond that, unfortunately is found so rarely, a level of maturity gained or change in status doesn't have the effect of also changing the friendship or relationship.    I have a friend who has known me through my silly college days, through becoming religious, through becoming independent and figuring out who I am.  I have known her through her college days, through grad school, through now having a job, and having found the guy she is going to marry.  Yes, our relationship has changed, because we both have changed and matured so much through the years.  But the closeness that we shared initially has not changed through all of our growing.  Because we respect each other so much as people, and we know each other's strengths and weaknesses and love each other anyway, I feel like that bond will not be broken by our changing lives.  I hope not.    I think that if we realize how much we each change and want people to respect that in us, then we will have a much easier time respecting other people's changes, and admiring them for having the courage to grow.

      Yay!  Thanks to an e-mail from  urlLink Am Ha-Aretz , I now have comments on my blog!  Who knew it could be so easy?  As someone who is not especially literate when it comes to computer stuff (at least on the programming end of things), I have to say that I really appreciate that there are programs out there that make these features relatively simple to install.  So leave me comments!

      It was one of those weekends where I began wondering how I was going to find things to fill the time, and when it ended I couldn't believe where all the time went.  I have to say that this weekend made me appreciate my friends once again.  Just the fact that I have such a nice, varied group of people that I can call upon and who call upon me is such a great thing, and I know how lucky I am to have such a chevra.  Saturday night a friend who I hadn't seen in a long time called me out of the blue saying that she was in town.  She came over, we caught up and then we went to a shiur by  urlLink Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb , of  urlLink Congregation Shomrei Emunah  (my shul).  He gave a talk to "older" single women in the community about dating.  I was concerned that the talk would be the typical chizuk, "every date is one closer to your bashert" talk.  But it wasn't, at all.  I was so impressed.  He told us that we need to look closer before saying no to a date, and we need to realize that a lot of the things that we feel are so important to look for in a guy are not as big of issues as we think they are.  He also said that we need to look for new ways to meet potential dates, because being set up by a stranger just doesn't make that much sense.  Thank you, Rabbi Gottlieb.  I think I need to start going to shul more often.  I really like the direction he is giving to the congregation.  I just ordered the new  urlLink book club  book,  urlLink "One People, Two Worlds"  and plan on making that the next book on my list.  A friend of mine came to talk to me yesterday about some issues she was having with another of our friends.  She talked and talked and I just listened for a long time.  It was what she needed.  But it was so interesting listening to her.  I realized that small things really make a big impact, even if you don't know it.  Going to someone for help can be as big a thing as being there for them.  And you have to be incredibly careful about everything you do, because you never know how what you do will end up being an example for someone else, and sometimes not in the way that you ever imagined it would be.  Finally, I have to throw a humungous "THANK YOU!" out to my friend Jennifer, who gave me the information for a large piece of the project that is due today, that I started working on yesterday, with no idea that I wouldn't be able to find some of the information that I needed.  And she brought me back urlLink  incredibly cool beads  from  urlLink Mardi Gras .  Old friends, new friends, sometimes friends.  They all make up your life, and contribute to your happiness so much.  I am so lucky.  Thank you guys!

      I was told last night that I am cynical.  That surprised me.  And upset me, to be honest.    This statement was based on comments I made about the politicians in America and how I don't like the values that most of our political leaders seem to embody.  We left the conversation with me stating that I think that, unfortunately, power corrupts.  But the question left hanging was, if power makes a leader corrupt, can you be a leader without power?  And is there any way for power to not corrupt a leader?  My feelings about leadership are that a true leader doesn't need power, they just naturally lead.  But then the question is, who are you leading if you don't have any power?  And there is gets murky, because you are stuck in the same circle, going around in circles about the influences of leadership and power on one another.    I believe the key is in humility.  Moshe was possibly the greatest leader ever.  The quality that most characterized him was humility.  Humility, the act of knowing and being able to use the assets that you have, but always keeping in mind that those assets are a gift.  Unfortunately, I don't think that most of the public leaders today, especially in the political arena, have much humility.  I feel like the incredible majority of politicians today go into politics not because they want the best for their constituents, but because they want power.  Unfortunately, I feel like those people who go into public service for the purpose of serving the public don't end up faring well, probably because they are eaten up by the power hungry people who tend to lead our political realm today.  Whew!  For someone not interested in politics, that was a lot said!  As for my cynicism, there might be some truth in that I am cynical towards the motivation behind the leaders in the public eye today.  And unfortunately, I think I have started having some doubts about the motivations behind a lot of the people I meet these days.  But I hope that I, and I think I do, still hold on to the belief that people are innately good and care about others and do the right thing out of love rather than fear.    I know that I am still surprised when I find out about the horrible things that one person will do to another.  I know I am still stunned by the stories I hear.  I know I am still shocked when someone hurts another and doesn't seem to feel remorse.  And in that way, I feel like I am clinging to my idealism.  I hope I don't ever get to the point where I am not surprised or hurt to find out that one person would hurt another.

      Ok, I know I have been on the existential side of things lately, but I guess I have had a lot to reflect on this past week or so.  I got news about someone from my past last week.  Sorry to be so cryptic, but I don't want to use details.  It brought up a lot of feelings in me that I really needed to think about.  The news was of the sort that, when it first presented itself, it was quite a blow.  But then, the more I thought about it, I realized that it was a thing of the past.  Because I am a different person than I used to be, it didn't affect me the way it would have six months ago.  Because I am more self-assured, more confident, because I know who I am better than I used to, the news wasn't as bad as I had thought it would be.  Or so I told myself.  Then last night I was talking to someone.  After hanging up, I realized that I let myself fall into all the same traps that I have always put myself through.  I make myself into an airhead when I talk to guys.  I have always done it.  And then I worry that I am not smart enough for them.  And then I realize that I shouldn't have worried about it at all, and sometimes they aren't smart enough for me.  (I am not trying to sound conceited here, I am trying to be honest.)  This is crazy and self-defeating.  And I know that it is.  But I do it all the time.    I can't figure out why I let myself do it.  When a guy is super smart, it takes me a while, but I will usually let myself act smart around him.  But I will always feel inferior and doubt myself.  When a guy isn't as smart, I will act dumb and then wonder why we didn't talk about good enough topics.  Duh, there are two people in the conversation here.  Why can't I just be myself?  Why do I have this fear of letting my intellect show?  Why do I doubt whether I am good enough for everything?  Why do I worry so darn much?

      Do we ever really know who we are?  Or who anyone else is?    I sometimes wonder how different people would describe me if asked and how their accounts would vary from one to the next.  I feel like my mother, or my friend, or my classmate, or my boss would give incredibly different descriptions of me.    And the truth is, I AM a different person depending on who I am relating to at the moment.  There are some people who I can talk to about certain things, and there are other people I can talk to about other things.  I don't know if there is one person who can relate to me on all my levels.  I am not sure I can recognize all my levels.  Different people bring out different things in me.  Something I have never considered before, when presented to me in a new light, can quickly become a whole new world to me, that I am going to choose to make a part of me.  And I am so enriched by having this new dimension in my life, but it also makes things just a small bit more difficult, in that it makes me just that much more complex, and harder to relate to.  If this is the case for me, then how much more do I not know anyone else?  I am constantly surprised by things I find out about different people.  Things that just don't seem to fit with my perception of those people.  But it is a part of them.    I guess part of the problem is that we judge other people based on our own experience.  How else can we?  But our own experience is so different from the next person's.  It's like we are always looking through tinted glasses.  We can never really see the whole of anyone else, because we are not going to be with any other person all the time.  I think  urlLink Shakespeare  was very aware of this.  His plays are full of misreading and misunderstanding other people.  He said, incredibly accurately, "All the world is a stage, and we are all merely actors." I can't imagine any truer words.  We act all the time.  We act the roles that we think others want us to be.  And if we say that we don't, then we are acting to ourselves.  The problem is, do we have a real self, a true self?  Is there one true persona inside that is who we really are, and are we capable of ever being who we really are?  Does it even exist?

      I read  urlLink Job  (or Iyov in Hebrew) this weekend.  What a story!  I had real issues with a lot of it.  I don't understand why Hashem allowed the Satan to do all those horrible things to Job.  Maybe it was a test for Job, maybe Hashem wanted to prove to the Satan that whatever happens, a person could have faith.  But why?  Why did Hashem have to prove anything to the Satan?  Why did the Satan have any power over Job to begin with?  At the end, when Hashem gave Job everything back, did that really make things okay again?  Job lost all his original children, are having replacement children the same as never having lost the original ones?  I can't imagine that it is.  I can't imagine that Job could just forget everything that he had gone through.  I think I need to learn Job with some commentary.  I think a trip to the bookstore might be in the works for this week.  If anyone has any good suggestions, let me know.  I also finished reading  urlLink Plato's   urlLink Phaedo  this past weekend (I have been doing way too much non-homework reading lately).  It is so interesting, when you consider when  urlLink Socrates  and Plato lived and the culture around them.  The  urlLink Phaedo  is the description of Socrates' last day, the day when he drinks the poison.  As is true to his character, he goes out philosophizing.    Socrates goes on about the soul and the body, and how you cannot reach true wisdom until you are separated from your body.  He then talks about what happens after death, and about the whole universe.  He speaks of a "God", not many gods when talking about what happens after life.  He says, "All men will agree that God, and the essential form of life, and the immortal in general, will never perish."  Now I don't know Greek, but I was told that the original word is Deos, which means one God.  Maybe as much as the Greeks wanted to believe that there were  urlLink many gods , therefore giving each of them less power, they really knew that there could only be one Being in charge of everything.  Interesting to think about, anyway.

      This week we read the parsha where Hashem gives the Jewish people the Ten Commandments.  It is said that all Jewish souls were present at Mount Sinai at this time.  That is, all the Jewish souls that then existed and will ever exist in the future.  In other words, I was there at Mount Sinai.  Wow.  Obviously, I don't remember being there, but I think a tiny spark must come through.  Why else would so many people still be Jewish, when it is not exactly easy or desirable to stand separately from everyone?  I think it is so amazing that Hashem and the Jews made a deal, shook hands, and have stuck by it for so long.  It says a lot about the two participants of the deal.  I was told last night that I was going to get myself in trouble for asking so many questions.  Not in trouble with anyone in particular, but that I was going to start doubting myself and what I believe in.  But I think that the opposite is true.  I think the act of questioning and seeking answers causes me to reaffirm my beliefs.  Maybe I don't love all the answers I find, but searching for them makes me learn more.  I have to believe that Hashem would not have put a framework into place that couldn't hold up to my questions.  Hmmm, lots of thinking to do.

      Was Odysseus a good leader?  I have to wonder if he was really a leader at all.  Don't leaders have to lead someone?  By the time Odysseus gets back to Ithaka, he is all by himself, because his "followers" managed to get themselves all killed off.  I would have to say that if Odysseus saw himself as a leader to those men, he was a miserable failure.   I have to wonder about how Homer wanted to portray Odysseus in the first place.  Is Odysseus supposed to be seen as a hero?  He is always crying, and lying and begging and taking.  Those don't sound much like heroic qualities to me.  I had the same problem with Achilleus in the Iliad, I didn't find his values particularly inspiring.  He goes crying to his mother in the very first book, and later he lets his best friend go get killed because he is too busy pouting about his loss of honor.  In the vein that nothing ever changes, I think these "heroes" are really celebrities - they have great stories, and can enthrall people they see with their charisma and charm, they are constantly give the royal treatment, and lots of gift and "honor."  But when you look at who they really are, the shell falls away and they really are people who care very much about their glory and not much else.  Why did it take Odysseus so long to get home?  I think he liked the attention of so many people trying to hold him.  It made him feel important.  He was horrible, and the people who he had a lot of contact with, while they were blinded to it, suffered from it.  His son grew up without a father, his wife was bothered by those stupid suitors for years, his mother was driven into an early grave, and he wasn't even up front with his father.  How many celebrities today treat their families in similar ways?  So, I feel like Homer might have been giving us the inside scoop on a movie star, while they have a certain "glory," they don't really have it all inside.  Maybe that is why they need the glory.

      I finished reading  urlLink The Alchemist  by  urlLink Paulo Coelho  last night.  Incredibly inspiring story about finding and pursuing your "Personal Legend."  Unfortunately, I have a huge project at work today so I can't spend much time blogging, but I definitely suggest reading it if you get a chance.

      I started reading  urlLink Plato's   urlLink Phaedo  last night.  Once again, I am amazed by the fact that nothing ever changes.    This past week, I had been thinking a lot about society and how it has become incredibly materialistic.  I figured that the materialism of society had come about in the last 100 years or so and that before that, people did care more about being good people, about values, about striving for truth and knowledge and all those noble gestures.    I had been thinking about why I don't want our outcome to be determined by society, I would rather things be determined by genetics or biology, or that we be given a purpose from Hashem before we are born.  To me, that way, even if you are not born into the most promising of circumstances, then maybe there is still hope that you have been given a spark, something to hope for, some potential within that you can actualize.  But if everything is nurture, and you are unfortunate enough to be born into a bad situation, then there is no hope.  The truth is, I think we are a mixture of nature and nurture, and I think that gives the most hope.  But I totally am digressing here.  My point is, I had been thinking in the past week that we have come to the point of being incredibly materialistic and how it is such a sad state.  And then I picked up my Plato book (I love that book!) and there is Socrates, on his last day of life, talking about the materialism and how the only way to escape it is through death.  He says that the only way to true knowledge is through death, because then the soul no longer has the body getting in the way, demanding attention.   And I realized, nothing ever changes, no matter how evolved and advanced we think we are, if we look back, we are the same as we have always been.

      The  urlLink Great Books Foundation  has a section on Judaism.  I am in the middle of a back and forth e-mail discussion about the following question:  Why does G-d cause the tree of knowledge of good and evil to grow in Eden, but tell Adam and Eve not to eat of it?  The challenge is that I have to use ONLY the text presented (though I can use my own translation) and no outside information or sources.  The story of Adam and Eve I know has a lot of embellishments, and it is so hard to not bring them in.  The person with whom I am discussing this with has never heard the embellishments (he is not Jewish), he calls me on them extremely quickly.   As with all my reading, trying to answer one question just leads to about 8,000 more questions.  At this point, I am not sure we are even talking about the initial question at all.  But maybe it all relates.    My shul,  urlLink Shomrei Emunah   has started a  urlLink book club  and the next book that they are reading is  urlLink One People, Two Worlds: A Reform Rabbi and an Orthodox Rabbi Explore the Issues That Divide Them .  I find this interesting, because I know that a lot of rabbis urged people not to read the book, arguing that it legitimized Reform Judaism.  I have to applaud the efforts of Shomrei to keep an open mind and discuss these issues in an open forum.    I feel that you can learn so much by learning about other views.  I told a friend that I was going to have this Torah discussion with someone who wasn't Jewish and her response was, "Don't do it."  Why not?  I think you can sometimes learn more from someone who doesn't agree with you than from someone who does.  And I definitely think it gives you cause to dig into your beliefs, and find a foundation for them, rather than accepting them because you are supposed to.  I think at the end of a discussion like this, you come out with a much stronger basis that you went in with.  I don't think that we should be afraid to be questioned.  I acknowledge that I don't know everything, but at least this will give me the impetus to learn more.

      So, I have been having issues these days.  I was trying to write a bit about myself yesterday and I found that I couldn't.  Trying to put a few words on a page to summarize who I am was suddenly the most difficult project I could think about attempting.  I mean, I am a student, an employee, a daughter, a sister, a friend, but what does that mean?  None of that captures what makes me an individual.   I have had this problem in the past, when trying to describe myself, having a problem with feeling like I am just one of the crowd, indistinguishable from anyone else.  But this time it is different, it wasn't that I couldn't figure out what makes me unique, I felt that I didn't even know who I am these days.    My priorities have shifted so much in the past few months.  School has opened up a new avenue for me, an avenue that I want to follow.  But getting a formal education is supposed to lead on a path to somewhere and at the moment, while I am loving the hike down the path, I don't know where this avenue ends up.    I know it is not necessarily a bad thing, that sometimes the process is more important than the outcome, and you learn so much just by going through the process, by taking the hike down the path.  I guess I just feel like this hike is becoming a bit rocky and steep at times.  Though I am not one to avoid a challenge.    Maybe I just want to know what my destination is so I have something to aim for.  I have found in the past that having a goal is always helpful so you know what you are striving to accomplish, and the fact that at the moment, I am unsure of my goal makes the hard work less rewarding in the sense that I don't know if it is advancing me in the right or wrong direction.  But I guess hard work is never wasted.  Oy.

      I finally finished reading The Pearl by Steinbeck.  It is a short 90 pages long but with everything else going on, it managed to take me almost two weeks to read it.  It is such an interesting story.  Kino, the father, finds the "Pearl of the World," which he hopes will bring in the money to save his baby son from a scorpion sting.  The "pearl of the world" eventually leads to the death of Kino's son.    Steinbeck has a beautiful way with words, he must be one of the most eloquent writers I have read in a long time.  His language is simple, but striking.  The characters in the story are so complex and Steinbeck manages to use a few words to portray their inner characters.    The story is so tragic and such an interesting commentary about what is important to people in life.  Kino gets so caught up in selling the pearl that he ends up sacrificing what he was initially try to save.  The powerful people in the book are portrayed so shallowly, interested primarily in money and willing to compromise their values so easily.  The contrast between the rich and poor citizens in the book is one of things vs. values, though these are easily blurred when positions change in the slightest.  Power is such an elusive prize and doesn't seem to be worth the sacrifices being made.  Such a short book, but it says so much.

      The Odyssey is full of portrayals of the relationship between a parent and child.  A character is hardly mentioned without the additional identification of their father's name.   I wonder at the appropriateness of the reality of the relationships portrayed between the parents and their children in The Odyssey.    Odysseus leaves his son, Telemachos, when Telemachos is only a baby.  He is gone for twenty years.  When Odysseus finally comes back to Ithaka, Telemachos welcomes him with open arms, and immediately begins to follow whatever Odysseus tells him to do.  This is contrasted in his relationship with his mother, Penelope, whom he questions and seems to distrust, even though she has been with him his entire life.  I have to wonder at Telemachos' trust of Odysseus.  Odysseus left the family 20 years ago, he doesn't know Telemachos at all.  I feel like Telemachos would have at least asked for more proof that Odysseus is who he says he is (as Penelope later does).  I also feel like the level of trust would not be present that is depicted in the book.  Another interesting parent-child relationship is the relationship of Odysseus to his parents.  Odysseus meets his mother in Hades.  She died out of her despair about his life.  The scene is so sad, it made me want to cry.  While Odysseus shows a bit of remorse about the fact that his mother dies from her sorrow over him, I don't feel like he cares so much about it.  And when he finally goes to his father after being gone for twenty years, does he apologize for the heartache he has given him, for the fact that his wife died from grief over him?  No, he taunts his father and lies to him before finally revealing himself.  I feel that Odysseus really abuses his relationships in The Odyssey.  I want to feel sorry that he had to go through so much to get home, but the way he treats the members of his family, and the fact that he deceives them so much really puzzles me.  Does he value his family?  Or does he see his image as more important than what everyone else is going through emotionally?    I hope I give more in my relationships with my family members than Odysseus does.

      I finished reading The Odyssey this weekend, but I think I still need more time to process it.  I feel like it was the first soap-opera, and it ended a bit abruptly but all in all, it was a great story.  I spent Shabbos with my rabbi and rebbetzin and their family, whom I hadn't seen in a really long time.  It was really nice.  The best feeling came a little while after I got there and their son went to his mom and told her, "I love it when Shoshana comes for Shabbos."  He and his sisters in turn then came and told me they loved me and loved me coming to visit.  What a feeling.  I am making a list of the simple things in life that make me really happy.  On the list so far are:   Colored pens Cuddling with my cat Those Post-It sticky arrows I am in love with A book than makes me sigh at the end Getting together with my friends and having hours fly by without realizing it  I went to a Super Bowl/Birthday party for one of my oldest friends last night.  We were reminiscing a bit about how long we had been friends.  It is such a nice feeling to know that there is someone who has known you through so many changes and still loves you.

      I was in Lakewood this past Shabbos, which is always an interesting experience.  Lakewood is not the kind of place in which I could ever see myself living, but visiting makes for interesting conversation at the very least.  I was talking to my friend about where she and her husband would like to settle down and raise their family, since she had previously indicated to me that it would not be Lakewood.  She grew up in Baltimore, and I asked her if she would consider living there.  Her response to me was that it was not the place that she wants to raise her children.  I asked her why and she told me she feels that Baltimore is too tolerant and that, in her opinion, over-tolerance fosters a lack of growth.  I asked her for an example of what she meant.  She used the example of tznius.  She said that growing up attending Bais Yaakov, she felt that the teachers there neglected to correct students who failed to dress in a tznius manner.  To my friend, a Jewish school should not hesitate to reprimand a student who did not feel an obligation to the value of tznius.  In her opinion, this reprimand would lead to inspiration on the student's part to want to grow and embrace the values that the school is officially based on.  I am not sure that I agree that this is the right approach, but I am not sure that I completely disagree with her concept either.  I think that reprimanding a student in high school about their sleeve length will often turn them off altogether, for two reasons.  First, during the high school years I think a lot of people are trying to establish their identity, and for Orthodox Jewish teenagers, this is often done in the form of dressing a bit differently, and I think a lot of kids need to go through that stage without being reprimanded, because a reprimand will often cause them to rebel further.  But I also I think that Torah values are much less about covering elbows and knees than treating others with respect, and I think that reprimanding a student for the sleeve length will impress upon those students the opposite message.    I think a tolerance in the manner of dress, but a extreme intolerance in how the students treat the people around them will give students a much greater impetus for growth.  I like the fact that I see the Bais Yaakov system sending their students out to do chesed for families within the community.  I think it is much more important to emphasize that we should care about the well-being of one another, and take care of others who can't take care of themselves, rather than forcing girls to button their shirts to their chin.    I am not suggesting that tznius should be thrown out the window, and the students at Bais Yaakov should be wearing shorts and T-shirts to class.  But I don't agree with the argument that longer skirts equals more growth.    Does tolerance cause stagnation and lack of growth?  Yes, but I think the tolerance that causes stagnation is much more about accepting judgment of others based on outward qualities.  If high school students need to be reprimanded, I think it is much more for excluding their classmates and not trying to do chesed for others than for wearing a skirt that doesn't quite cover their knees.  I think a focus on inward growth rather than outward would go a long way to bring a community together.

      I have discovered that I really like arguing.  Ok, so it is not such a new discovery.  But I spent this weekend in lively debates with several different people and I found that I really enjoyed myself.  Now, I am talking about a very specific form of arguing.  I don't enjoy confrontational, hurtful, attacking fights at all.  What I am talking about is an intellectual debate about topics where each participant in the "argument" brings to the table points which have valid support behind them.  An argument where the people involved might be talking about a topic that touches them on an emotional level, but they don't get emotionally hurt during the discussion.  Where the idea is what is being attacked, not the people who are involved in the discussion.    I am not sure why I enjoy arguing so much, because in general I don't find myself to be a confrontation, hard-to-get-along-with person.  I do have strong opinions, and I won't hesitate to bring them to light, providing I am in the right environment.  But I don't pick fights just for the sake of fighting, and if I am in a situation where I don't think the argument will be listened to, or if I feel like it will cause someone to be hurt, I don't bother.    But I really love finding someone with whom I can argue intellectually, who won't walk away personally hurt afterwards, and who actually does think about what we talked about.  I like arguing with a person who doesn't take the argument personally, they take the argument as a mental challenge and a way to explore a topic more thoroughly.  I like arguing because I learn so much about another person's view and through the argument, can learn a lot about where I stand on a particular topic as well.  I really love the feeling of bringing a point to light that the other person hasn't thought about before.  I think I like making other people think.    I wonder what my appreciation of argumentation says about me?

      During Spring Break, I had two big missions to accomplish: 1) To clean for Pesach, and 2) To write a good portion of my paper for my Counseling class.  Unfortunately, I have failed miserably at both.  As for Pesach cleaning, my roommate and I decided to sell our kitchen for the week of Pesach so that we don't have to deal with it all.  That just leaves my room and the living room, which won't be too bad.  Should be able to take care of it at the last second.  My paper, however, is a completely different issue.  The assignment is to develop my person integrated approach to counseling.  I decided on the theories I want to include, found some great journal articles, read my textbook.  You would think I would be ready to write.  However, I find myself completely at a loss as to how to even start.   I think my problem is that I am having trouble reconciling my feelings about the nature of therapy altogether.  Now, please don't get me wrong, I absolutely think that there are people out there who do need serious professional help.  I think there are people who have real issues, who have been abused and neglected and have serious psychological issues.  But I think I am having trouble with whether I really believe that there are so many people in the world who need to pay a stranger to give them advice (don't jump on me yet, I know that counseling is not about giving advice, but I do think that many people go to therapy seeking advice).  Many people these days seem to feel that everyone could use professional counseling, and I don't know if I am ready to agree with that.  I also have a problem with the idea of being a therapist with the mentality of being there to fix other people's problems.  What gives the common therapist the qualifications to do that?  Because they are so well-adjusted?  Mass numbers of people being in therapy is a relatively new concept.  What has changed that has caused so many people to feel they need professional help with their problems?  I am afraid that therapy will cause people to seek out strangers to help them rather than relying on the people who are already in their lives.  I feel like this could cause a lot of resentment and eventually, the breakdown of a lot of relationships rather than the mending of them.    I wonder about the fact that so many people these days are on anti-depressive , anti-anxiety and other medications.  Is therapy helping these people?  Or are these people going to therapy looking for easy answers to their problems?  And are those therapists giving them the impression that there are easy answers to many of life's most difficult issues?  I don't think all therapy is bad, I don't want anyone to think that.  But I think these are some of the reasons I am having a hard time writing about my approach to counseling.  I am not sure I believe in what I have to write about.

      I was thinking this morning about how it is impossible to play the "what if" game.  The "what if" something small was different.  But you can't do it, because when you change something that is seemingly small, you put in motion so many other changes, and then you realize that nothing would be recognizable.  I was thinking about some of the people in my life, and wondering "what if" I had had a slightly different relationship with those people, "what if" I had met them a few years earlier or later, "what if" circumstances had turned out slightly differently.  But I couldn't follow through.  When I think about it like a stone thrown into a pond, the ripples just get bigger and bigger, it would make waves that would have left my life unrecognizable.  I have also been thinking recently about a specific person who, while not playing an incredibly active role in my life, had one of the biggest impacts upon it.  This person, who I can't say I know well, who I don't consider a friend or even really an acquaintance, set in motion possibly the greatest journey that I have taken thus far.  This person has had such a profound influence on my life, in such an indirect way.  Could he have had any idea what his influence would be?  I feel fortunate that recently, I was able to express some sort of gratitude to this person.  I don't think I can ever adequately thank him for what he gave me, how do you express thanks to someone you barely know for completely changing your life?    But when I try to play the "what if" game with this person and the influence he made on my life, I can't even begin to imagine where or what kind of person I would be today.  It is this way in which I think Hashem works in our lives and this is the way I see Hashem most clearly in my own life.  I look to the people who are currently in my life and the people who have formerly been a part of my life.  Some of those people have made such huge impacts on me, and a lot of them are people that I definitely think Hashem put in my life for that purpose.  Some of these people came from such amazingly different backgrounds from me that I can't logically conclude that they came into my life by chance.  Even those who have caused me pain in my life have been there for a reason, and my life would not be the same without having had those experiences.  As much as I would like to wonder "what if" I hadn't had those pains or sorrows, I realize that I am that much more complete for having had them and I wouldn't exchange those experiences for any "what if" I can imagine.  I wouldn't be the same person if I did.

      I have been thinking a bit about relationships - how they are formed, why they are formed, what makes a good one.  I am not talking necessarily about intimate relationships here - I am talking really general - friendships, acquaintances, colleagues.    It is really interesting to me how we communicate on such different levels with different people.  My relationships are so varied - each one of them seems to be founded by something slightly different.  It makes me wonder why we "click" with some people and not with others.  I have tons in common with some of the people with whom I have relationships, but on the other hand, some of my closest friendships are with people who have incredibly different backgrounds from myself.  It doesn't seem to make a difference, there doesn't seem to be a formula.    I think this is one of the great things about relationships - we can get along with someone so incredibly different from ourselves, and because of that relationship, explore and learn about so many different things that we might not otherwise ever be exposed to.  I have people in my life who I have so little in common with and agree with so little about, and yet, I enjoy being around them so much and we never run out of things to talk about.  Then I have people in my life who I can share so much with because they agree with me on so many issues, and that is a great confirmation for the values that I hold and beliefs that I have.  There are people that I have come into contact with whom I have tons in common - common interests, common background, common goals - and yet, I can't relate to them, can't talk to them for more than a few minutes before we run out of conversation.  And there are those that I would think are so different that we could never find anything to share, but we do, easily.  This makes me wonder what is behind the magic of a relationship.  What makes some people capable of connecting to each other and others incapable.  There is some quality there that I can't quite get a hold of, or define properly.  I want to say it is respect, but there are lots of people I respect that I can't relate to.    I do think, however, that my life is so great because of the fact that I never know who exactly I am going to connect with.  The array of people in my life gives it so much richness.  It has also encouraged me not to overlook someone easily, because I never know what jewel I will find in them.

      I heard  urlLink Rabbi Reinman , co-author of the book  urlLink One People, Two Worlds , speak this weekend at my shul,  urlLink Shomrei Emunah .  From the book, I didn't especially like Rabbi Reinman's viewpoint.  Hearing him speak, I really liked him a lot more.  He spoke about how the idea for the book came about and then about the controversy that has surrounded the book since the publication.  He made the conflict sound much less striking than the Jewish media has made it out to be (big surprise there).    What I found interesting is the fact that in writing the e-mails that went into the book, Rabbi Reinman had several people to whom he showed each posting.  These people would go over each detail and word to make sure that they were sound points and accurately reflected Orthodox thought.  He says that the Reform rabbi who co-authored the book,  urlLink Ammiel Hirsch , claims he did not use this same type of screening.    I found this interesting because as reading the book, I found Rabbi Reinman to present a very right-wing perspective on the world.  In hearing him speak, and from hearing comments from  urlLink Rabbi Gottlieb , who spent the weekend with Rabbi Reinman, it sounds like he really has a much wider view, with very diverse interests and knowledge.    Something Rabbi Reinman said that I found extremely interesting was in response to a comment that his co-author made to him.  (Please forgive me for paraphrasing slightly, I don't remember the exact wording.)  He said that Ammiel Hirsch made a comment to him about not being the typical close-minded Ultra-Orthodox Jew.  Rabbi Reinman's response was that it was because he was the one that Rabbi Hirsch knows.  Rabbi Reinman went on to point out that there are close-minded and open-minded people throughout every group of people you look at.    I agree with this and it was something that I really needed to hear.  There are extremely close-minded Orthodox Jews, there are extremely close-minded Reform Jews.  There are close-minded Non-Jews.  There are also open-minded people in each of these groups.  I have been frustrated lately with the close-mindedness of the people in my community, but I have not really been looking at the fact that there are close-minded people everywhere, not just in Orthodox Judaism.  It is easier for me to see it in the Orthodox Jewish world, because that is the one I know the best.  Because I know it the best, it is also the easiest for me to find fault with, especially if I am looking for it.  I think from now on, I am going to try (and I know that I will not always succeed) to focus on those who are the open-minded of the community rather than those whose opinions I don't agree with.  I think an outlook like this will lead to being happier with this life that I have chosen to be a part of.

      A big cheer for my former university,  urlLink The University of Alabama at Birmingham , whose  urlLink Blazers beat top-seeded Kentucky  last night in a nail-biting NCAA game.  Why couldn't they be that good when I was there?  A smaller cheer goes to the  urlLink Alabama Crimson Tide  who beat Stanford this week.  Even though I never liked the Crimson Tide so much (they were always a bit cocky), I have to give them credit for: a) beating a top-seeded team, b) being my brother's college of choice, and c) for being an Alabama team.  *Just wanted to thank  urlLink Josh  for cluing me in to the wins of my beloved Alabama teams.

      I get so frustrated with life at times.  I don't understand myself half the time, so I guess it makes sense that I don't understand other people.  I just wish I could unscrew some people's brains and peer inside to figure out what is going on.  The problem is, as frustrated as I get with other people, and as unclear as they seem to be to me, I am sure that I am probably just an unclear to them.    I just wonder sometimes if I am expected much more than I am giving, or offering.  I wonder if I am totally off base sometimes with what I am expecting from other people, from life.  I just want clarity and guidance as to the right decisions.  That is what I pray for the most.  Does it ever get easier?  Is there anything that makes it easier?

      In reading The Prince and the Pauper, two things have been standing out in my mind.    The first is the same impression I have been getting from a lot of the reading I have been doing lately.  Wow.  I am so in awe of writers who can use words so effectively and beautifully.  Reading Twain, I am just struck with how he strings words together to draw a picture in my head.  It is such an incredible talent, and something I don't know if you can learn or train yourself to do.  I love reading, because the images a person puts together from these words can become so personal, and a story can be so meaningful to so many different people.  It is much more powerful than a movie, because a movie's pictures are so limited - they limit the colors, the sounds, the perspective.  A good writer can move beyond that and be meaningful to such a vast array of different people.  I love that.  I wish I could do that.  What specifically strikes me about The Prince and the Pauper is that Twain makes such an interesting comment about the way things run.  When we are submerged in a world, it is extremely difficult to take a step back, look at things objectively and make changes in failing systems.  Both characters, when submerged in the other's world, instantly see its failings and make changes based on their completely opposite view.  It would have been impossible for each of them to do the same for their own lives.  But because they come a view that is so distant from how they are raised, they can look at situations from a distinctly separate view, and make changes that correct so many wrongs that have been perpetuated by those who have always lived in a certain system.  The other thing in the book that Twain makes a point about is how our reality can change so quickly.  The prince, who is thrown from the palace with lines of servants to do his every bidding, quickly learns to find comfort in such small things.  A dry blanket, something warm.  Things that a few days before would have been abhorrent to him now become his comfort and he learns to appreciate the small things in life that before he hardly even knew existed.  I sometimes wish I could be given such a wake-up.

      In  urlLink Scrolling Forward , David Levy makes a quick comment about refrigerators that got me thinking.  I have often told people that my refrigerator is my favorite thing in my apartment.  Not because of what is in my fridge, because of what is ON my fridge.    I think you can tell a lot about a person by what is on their fridge.  Some people have cool magnets, others have photos, some have menus from favorite restaurants, some people keep theirs bare.  My fridge is covered with all kinds of great stuff.  I have pictures - of my brothers, my friends, my friends' children.  I have  urlLink magnets  that people have given to me, from different places and programs that I have been, some chosen for their strength in holding things onto the fridge, some chosen for nostalgic reasons.  I have  urlLink Magnetic Poetry  magnets that my dad gave to me - my roommate and I sometimes spell out messages to each other on the fridge.  I have notes and letters from people that mean a lot to me.  I have my candlelighting times, and a pre-Shabbos checklist.  I have a few clippings from newspapers that represent inside jokes or things I want to remember.  People are definitely the central focus of my fridge, which I hope is an indication of what is important in my life.  I am the type of person who cares a lot less about things being orderly than about them being meaningful.  I understand that each person has his own way of doing things, but I find it sad when someone is so concerned with everything matching that they can't bring themselves to display a memento that reminds them of someone they love.    I guess because I am so far away from so many of my friends, I love my reminders of them on my refrigerator, I love seeing those reminders every time I go in the kitchen.  To me, my fridge is a lot more than a place to keep my food cold.

      I have a lot of thoughts being churned about in my head at the moment - it was an incredibly full weekend, and I didn't get nearly enough done.  I am amazed at how much school work I did in one day, without managing to fully complete anything I set out to accomplish.    I finished reading  urlLink One People: Two Worlds  this weekend.  I am still thinking a lot about the arguments of the authors.  The truth is, I liked a lot of what each of them said, and didn't like a lot of what each of them said.  The biggest problem I had with both of them is that they each had their own agenda - and they were clearly different agendas - and neither one of them really listened to each other's arguments, they just kind of argued around each other.  I didn't find either side to be terribly grounded, and I think both of the authors left the book with a respect for the other author (which is great), but little respect for each other's viewpoints.  I felt each author was wearing glasses to both put a rose-colored spin on their own view and to shield themselves from clearly understanding and seeing the opposing view.  I guess for me, someone who has lived in both of their worlds, it was a bit frustrating to read them dance around each other without really coming together at any point.  But I did find the book very interesting and thought-provoking, and I really enjoyed the section where they discussed Israel.  I started reading  urlLink The Prince and the Pauper  by  urlLink Mark Twain  this weekend.  I am really enjoying it.  It is the story of a prince and a pauper (obviously) whose lives get switched (it reminds me of The Parent Trap).  What I find so interesting is that each boy has desired to live in the other's world, but when they get there the descriptions of those contrasting worlds is so negative.    For the pauper, when confronted with life in the palace, he says "he was indeed a captive now and might remain ever shut up in this  gilded cage , a forlorn a friendless prince; except G-d in his mercy take pity on him and set him free."  This is a boy who dreamed of living the life of royalty.  The prince, when faced with living a normal life describes his new life as "an outcast, clothed in rags,  prisoner in a den fit only for beasts , and consorting with beggars and thieves."  This is a prince who ran out of the castle the minute he had the chance.  How interesting that each initially felt that they were trapped in their own lives, and longed to be set free.  Yet when they are actually faced with those desired lives, they see them as a greater cage than the lives they were born into!  I think many of us long for a life that we don't currently have, but if we were placed into it, we may soon realize how lucky we truly are for what we do have.  I guess that is why  urlLink Pirkei Avos (4:1)  says, "Who is rich?  He who is happy with his lot."  Finally, I was given a situation to think about this weekend that is the kind of situation that had faced me in the past, and it was something that I had thought I wouldn't be faced with again.  The implications, though different, are oddly similar.  It is interesting how your life can change, but not really.

      In the book  urlLink Scrolling Forward , David M. Levy discusses whether e-mail has obliterated the art of letter writing and consequently caused us to let our writing skills deteriorate.    I love my e-mail.  With e-mail, I keep in touch with friends in Israel, Alabama, New Jersey and Oklahoma.  I am at a computer all day long and while I might have an extremely hard time picking up the phone when I get home at the end of a really long day or sitting down to write a letter to someone, I can take a few minutes while I am at work to quickly catch someone up on what is going on in my life and inquire about theirs.   I am always irritated when I meet people who don't use e-mail, because I know that without it, I will have a much harder time keeping in touch.  With e-mail these days, you can send pictures, cards, links to interesting articles and so much more.  What a great invention.  Branching out from just e-mail, having a blog has been a really interesting experience.  I have tried and abandoned many diaries in my life.  When I first began this blog, I saw it as an opportunity to get some of my thoughts out, I didn't expect anyone to read it.  It was my new diary, I don't think I had any real plan on how often I expected to update, or what would really go into it.  Then I started school, and I started reading, writing and thinking.  I had never been especially interested in writing before, but then I found that there were things that I was thinking about that came out better when I could organize them in words instead of keeping them all in my head.  Through this blog, I have come to have such a greater appreciation and enjoyment of writing.  And I think it has caused me to become a much better writer.  Then I started getting the occasional e-mail about my blog, which surprised me.  I guess I never thought about real people reading it, and about my words causing someone else to think.  Now, with comments, it has gotten even more interesting, I am now seeing other people interact on my blog.    What a weird medium the Internet is for meeting people, inspiring people and making connections.  I never thought I would be a part of it, a part of this online community where people from disparate corners of the world; people who very likely will never meet in person; can interact, communicate with each other and air their views on important and not-so-important topics.  I am still not quite sure how I feel about having a blog that other people can read and comment on, it is weird knowing that people I don't know probably know a good bit about me.  But I know that I like having a forum to be able to express my thoughts, I like working my ideas out and writing about them, and from the comments I have been getting, making other people think as well.   I think the Internet, while it may have caused a lot of people to give up their pen and paper, has also caused some people, at least me, to work at their writing and thinking skills, and it has given them a way to interact with people who they never would have previously come in contact with.  I am not ready to condemn it quite yet.

      In the past week, I finished one paper and started another, started reading  urlLink Scrolling Forward by David M. Levy  for a class, got an A on a  urlLink test , and learned about  urlLink Carl Rogers  and  urlLink client-centered therapy .  All of this has left with very little time for reading on my own.  I am almost finished with  urlLink One People, Two Worlds  and read a bit more of  urlLink Aristotle's Politics  last night, but I don't have anything that is ready to be blogged about at this point.  So I thought I would blog a bit about one of my favorite topics:  urlLink Reese's Cups .  (I apologize to those of you who keep cholov yisrael.)  Last semester, my professor asked us for examples of great ideas throughout history.  He was looking for things like freedom, justice, virtue.  The first idea that came out of my mouth was Reese's Cups.  My professor was taken back a bit, he challenged me as to the greatness of the Reese's Cup, but I had a good following from several of the other students who felt strongly about the greatness of the combination of peanut butter and chocolate also.  Ok, I know I am being a bit silly, but the fact is that a little bit of peanut butter covered with chocolate and wrapped in gold foil can improve my mood tremendously.  The mixture of salt and sweet is just what I need on certain days.  Scientists can say that chocolate has whatever in it that makes us feel happy, maybe it is the protein in the peanut butter, I don't know.  What I do know is Mr. Reese was a really brilliant guy.  There are other things that make me happy - an e-mail from an old friend who I haven't from in a while, someone saying something nice to me when I am down, working really hard on something and knowing that I have done a good job.  I am not saying that Reese's Cups are the secret to world peace or anything like that.    But the truth is, I can think of little else that can make me feel so much better without having to depend on any other person.  I don't use this strategy so often, because there are drawbacks to Reese's Cups - they do tend to embody more calories than I am willing to ingest on a normal day.    But for one of those days when I wake up and the sky is gray and I feel ugly and down and something is just off, a little Reese's Cup goes a ridiculously long way to making me feel better.  And I don't think there are many things out there that have that same power.  So to me, the Reese's Cup is one of the greatest ideas out there.

      Each week, my chevrusa and I go through the first few pasukim of the weekly parsha in Hebrew, translate them, and then talk a little bit about what we just translated. It has been so great, because while my initial goal was simply to work on my Hebrew, I am also gaining a much greater interest in reading the Chumash and knowing each week's Parsha.  I have found that going in depth into the first few Pasukim gives me just enough to make me curious about the rest of the Parsha, so I have been going on to read the rest on my own (in English, my Hebrew hasn't improved that much yet).  Last night, we were learning Parsha Ki Sisa.  Two things struck me.  The first was how amazing is it that Hashem accepts a half-shekel from each of us as atonement for our souls.  It seems like such a small thing to ask, just a half-shekel, in exchange for such an amazing gift from Hashem - atonement for my soul.  I felt like this truly showed Hashem's mercy, that He would accept something so small in exchange for something so big.    The other thing that I loved about the concept of the half-shekel was that each person gave the same amount.  No one gave more, no one gave less, each person was considered equal.  I feel like this was saying that no one's atonement and no one's soul was worth than anyone else's, in Hashem's eyes.    Everyone's atonement offering was then put together to be used for the Tent of Meeting, where all the Jews would serve Hashem.  What an amazing experience that must have been - for each person to know that they had part of this place of worship, that is would not have been quite complete without their personal donation.  I think we should all feel this way every day and know that without each soul, Bnai Yisrael is not totally complete.

      is a happy life???  I was talking to a friend last night and we were talking about school, and he asked me the dreaded question - "So what are you going to do after you graduate?"  I began detailing to him what I see as my current options - stay in Psychology and go for either a Specialist's degree in School Psychology or my Licensure as a Counselor.  OR I could go to St. John's, read a lot of philosophy and literature, think like crazy and end up either teaching high school or going on to get a PhD.   I explained to him that I loved reading classic philosophy, that the more I have been reading, the more I want to read, how it makes me think so much...and how it also makes me question my beliefs more and more.  He stopped me right there and asked me why I would cause such problems for myself.  His feeling was, Orthodox Judaism is beautiful and meaningful and brings a lot of joy to a person's life, so don't question things.  Don't make things harder than they have to be.  If you have to have a shallow understanding of things in order to be happy, so be it.  Life is about making happiness easy.  I countered with the point that why should I dedicate my life to something that I only have a shallow understanding of?  Why should I let Torah dictate what I do from the minute I wake up until the minute I go to sleep if I can't even find satisfactory answers to real questions?  (I want to take a second here to say that I don't think that there aren't answers to my questions, I just think that asking questions and searching for answers is a very worthwhile process.)  He told me about another friend of his who was a baal teshuvah who was always asking questions, and therefore was not happy.  He kept saying to me that it is just easier to not ask questions, and not worry about things, that you could then be happier.  So I asked him, "Is ignorance bliss?"  He said he wasn't talking about ignorance, he was just saying not to look at things to the point where it would cause internal conflict.  I don't agree with this outlook.  I agree that the process of asking questions that are difficult to answer can cause a lot of dissonance in a person's life, but I don't agree that the outcome is unhappiness.  I think that when you search and find answers to these incredibly difficult questions, the reward for the search is immeasurable, and you are subsequently standing on an incredibly stronger foundation than before.    I don't think that reading classical philosophers will necessarily lead me to reject Jewish beliefs, I think in a lot of ways since I have been reading Plato and Aristotle and Homer, I have seen how Torah does encompass such a vast array of thought and how it is in everything.  And I think that is beautiful and will eventually lead me to a stronger grasp on why I chose this life to begin with.   For me, the process of becoming a baal teshuvah was an incredibly difficult process of questioning everything I had been taught growing up and finding the answers to life's questions and finding the path that was right for me.  I don't think this process has ended, I think I have now stepped into a new phase of it.  And I think it might very well be coming to a circle.  I think that now that I have come to the point where Torah is firmly embedded in my life, I am now ready to look at the outside world and bring it together with the Torah values I have learned.  As I learned in becoming religious, the process often is not easy - it can hurt and it can cause a lot of questioning, probing and doubt along the way.  But when it comes together, because of the difficulty in working towards the goal, it is so much more meaningful and concrete.  And that is what I want for myself.

      I had a lot of things that came up that made me think this weekend - I don't think they are all going to tie to together, but I might get lucky.   urlLink Parshas Zachor  was read this Shabbos.  I have a very hard time with the idea that this piece of the Torah, which commands the Jews to wipe out another nation, is one of the few pieces of Torah each year that everyone absolutely must hear.  As many times as other nations have tried to wipe out the Jews, as much as we are supposed to love peace, and see every person as a creation of Hashem; I have trouble with the fact that the Jews are commanded to bloody their hands and kill someone else.  I know that we are not commanded to wipe out just anyone, that Amalek set a precedent for trying to combat us, but I still don't understand why that particular parsha is a must-hear for everyone.  I have been thinking a lot lately about the fact that, throughout history, so many Jews have been lost.  During the exodus from Egypt, only one-fifth of the Jews actually left.  During the Spanish Inquisition, tons of Jews converted.  Many, many Jews today are intermarrying and their children will no longer either be Jewish or know that they are Jewish.  Many of my family members fall into this category.  I don't understand, if the Jews are Hashem's chosen people, how He can allow so many of His children to just fall away.  I asked this question at the Purim seudah, and I was told that Hashem is like a father, He has to let His children make their own decisions and find out for themself about the correct path.  But how far should a father go to this end?  To the point where He loses His children completely?  Being from  urlLink Alabama , people often ask me about the racist attitudes that they perceive as being rampant in the South.  When I tell them about the fact that I actually worked for three years in an  urlLink office  whose mission was to combat racism, sexism, Anti-Semitism and bring people of all backgrounds together, they often are surprised and I feel like they feel like I had an unusual experience for the South.  So why is it that the people who I know who are from New York, New Jersey and places distinctly North of the Mason-Dixon line are the one's who I hear spouting some of the worst racial comments I have ever heard in my entire life?  If the North is so enlightened, and racism is not a problem up here, then why is it acceptable to call black people "monkeys" and use the "N" word in the historical derogatory fashion in which it should be completely wiped out?  (I just want to say that I WISH I was making this up.)  Why are people surprised when I don't find their comments funny, or acceptable, at all? Never in my life have I heard the garbage I hear coming from people who are supposedly so sophisticated.  It really embarrasses me.  I have another topic in mind, but I am going to leave it for another day, because I think I can tie up the above points by saying simply that I think that we should respect and treat  every  human with the respect that we would ourselves want to be treated.

      I didn't blog yesterday because it was  urlLink Taanis Esther  and I didn't want anyone to have to try to make sense of my thoughts when brain had been deprived of food.  However, I did want to say a few things about Purim.  One of the things that I am always struck by is the fact that Hashem's name is not mentioned a single time in the Megillas Esther.  (This strikes me as appropriate because when I look around at people getting drunk on Purim, I have a hard time seeing Hashem also.)  I wouldn't want to speak for anyone else, but I know that there are times when I wonder if Hashem is up there, if He really cares about everything that is going on in my life, why He is making things so difficult.  I wonder why certain things are easy for some and not for others, or why I am put in a particular situation that seems to make my life that much more confusing.  I wonder why some people seem to suffer so much.  And then I look back at my life, and I take note of the things and people who are in my life.  Some of my closest friends, some of the people who make a huge difference in my life and are now gone from it, some of the adventures I have gone through - they just don't make sense.  I don't believe these things happened by chance.    I didn't recognize at the time what an impact some of these events and people would make on my life.  But in looking back, I can honestly say that I think Hashem had a hand in bringing me to the point I am at today.  And I think that today, while I am going through a lot of internal confusion about where I am headed, Hashem is guiding me and wants me to go through all this for a reason.  I am just not sure what the reason is yet.  I think in the story of Purim, while the characters do not proclaim out loud Hashem's influence, Hashem is there, guiding the Jews to reaffirm their faith and to come together as a community to combat their own obliteration.  I think sometimes it takes a crisis to make a person or group of people listen and pull together.  I think one of the crises we speak of today is that of assimilation.  I have been wondering lately about why Hashem would allow assimilation and Judaism that doesn't embrace Torah as His word if it was absolutely wrong. I think maybe Hashem is telling us that we need to come together, to have Ahavas Yisrael, rather than writing off so many Jews as "non-believers" and therefore unworthy of our respect.    Maybe we need to be looking harder for Hashem's hidden presence in the messages He sends us.  Sometimes it is the softest whisper that moves us the most.

      I have a bit of a dilemma at the moment.  I have been reading Aristotle's Politics.  In the Politics, Aristotle discusses natural slaves and natural masters.  He discusses, dissects and disapproves of different models and suggestions for an ideal government.  One thing common to the suggested governments, and one of the few things that Aristotle does not make objection to, is of there being several classes of people that function within the government.  I am not necessarily talking about financial classes here, it is more a matter of a level of natural status - some people are meant for the upper crust and some are meant to be slaves.  Some are meant to rule and some (in many of the governments, the women) are meant to serve.  I have a problem with the concept that some people are born better than others.  How do you determine what is better and worse?  Where do you draw the line between one class and the next?  Does the concept of what is better and worse change throughout the years with our changing values or does it always stay the same?  The dilemma I am having is, I don't think everyone is the same, and I don't think everyone is equally good in all areas.  I think that people are born with unique talents.  I think people are naturally gifted in different areas.  Some people have an incredible ability to write, others have natural physical prowess and still others "get" math.  I don't think everyone is equally capable of everything, and I believe that this is something born in humans, not something that is a product of society.  (Just a slight aside - I am not discounting the role of society in forming a person's world, but I do believe some talents to be innate.)  So, if people are better or worse in specific areas of life, and this is a natural thing, then is it completely audacious of me to have problems with Aristotle's views?  If I believe that men and women relate to the world and each other in very different ways, is there a mutual exclusivity for me to also have a problem with the idea of women being subordinate to men?  I am really struggling with this.  I guess my feeling is that until we can define what exact attributes dictate what level a person "should" be on, and this is something that I don't think we will ever be able to do with any kind of satisfaction, then we can say that people are different and not necessarily better, just better in certain areas.    I think that the fact that people are better in certain areas than others contributes so much to the richness of the world, and to say that one talent is more important than the next would mean the loss of so many important contributions.  I think people would get so focused on what society feels is most important that they would subsequently give up on developing those unique talents that makes each one of us who we are.

      There is a person in my life right now, that every time I talk to him, he gives me something to think about.  Sometimes it is about something I have read, sometimes it is about human nature, sometimes life in general, sometimes it is about my own life.  The last category are the ones that keep me up at night.    Yesterday I was trying to give him an overview of how the Orthodox world exists.  I was trying to illustrate the spectrum of Jews who consider themselves Orthodox, what binds them all, and what separates them.  I tried to explain how so many people can consider themselves Orthodox, from the Modern Orthodox set to the yeshivish and Chasidish sets.  From my explanation, he drew a line across the table and showed me where he saw me on the line.  I didn't think he was terribly accurate, and I showed him where I would put myself.    He said something that was interesting, though.  He pointed to where he saw me on the line, and told me that he sees me moving in one direction on that line every day.  I told him that I agreed with him on that point.  It made me think about growth in life.  I have always been fond of the idea that it doesn't necessarily matter where you currently are on the ladder of growth, what really matters is how far you have climbed up the ladder.    It made me wonder if the ladder has any real relation to that line that we drew on the table.  If you go left or right, does that mean you are going up or down the ladder also?  Does one necessarily correspond to the other?  I think a lot of people would say that the farther right you move on that line, that the higher on the ladder you are climbing.  I don't agree.    I think that you can move left and right on the line, and if you are not integrating Torah into your life while you are doing it, if you are not treating others with respect, if you are not trying to grow as a person, to refine your character, then it doesn't matter how far right or left you are, you are not going to be going up the ladder at all.    Conversely, I think that if you are learning Torah, and finding how it fits into life, and incorporating it into everything you learn, whether it is something that is traditionally Jewish or not, as long as you are climbing the ladder and improving yourself, then where you are on the line is unimportant.  I guess I feel like a lot of people would think that the line is more important than the ladder, or maybe that position on one necessarily dictates position on the other.  I don't think that is true, though I think that I sometimes find myself accepting it without digging deeper.  I hope that, in the future, I can train myself to look at the ladder rather than the line.

      I started reading  urlLink One People, Two Worlds : A Reform Rabbi and an Orthodox Rabbi Explore the Issues That Divide Them  this weekend.    It is the back and forth e-mail exchange between two rabbis - one Reform and one Orthodox.  When it first came out, a lot of the Orthodox rabbis claimed that the book should not be read, that it legitimized Reform Judaism.  I am not sure what they were so concerned about.  I don't think any Orthodox Jew would read this book, lose his faith and decide to become Reform.  The Reform rabbi actually states something similar in one of his posts.    I think the book is a great dialogue between two people who have tons in common but tons of differences also.  In reading, I feel like the dialogue is familiar, I feel like I have similar ones regularly, though my discussions are usually with non-Jews.  In reading the book, I am upset by a lot of the things that the Reform rabbi says, but I am also upset about quite a bit of what the Orthodox rabbi says.  I feel like in a lot of ways, he is narrow-minded and really does not have much understanding of any world outside the right-wing Orthodox world.  And I think that is sad.    I have to give credit to  urlLink Shomrei Emunah  for choosing this book for their  urlLink book club .  It is definitely an interesting read.  I will write more once I finish reading it.

      Ugh - does work ever get interesting? Apparently not on a beautiful Friday when all I want is to be outside, basking in the sun.  Oh well, got to pay the bills somehow.  It was suggested that I write about my experiences growing up Jewish in the South.  And I think it is a great suggestion.  That will begin next week.  I don't think I can coherently put together a serious post today (and I have my final paper of the semester looming over my head).    As for my final paper of the semester (I can't beleive it's almost over already), I am writing a book critique of  urlLink Fire in a Canebrake  by Laura Wexler - it is the story of the "Last Mass Lynching in America."  It was incredibly well-written, and brought a lot of poignant topics that struck me especially strongly, with the story having occurred in Georgia, another one of those states that I have lived in (there are probably a few I haven't yet mentioned).  Anyway, as Shabbos is coming in a few hours, and I am looking forward to actually co-hosting a meal of my own tonight, I want to wish everyone a good Shabbos.  And to  urlLink Greg  and  urlLink Peninah , who are having me for Shabbos lunch tomorrow - I can't wait!

      Don't get too excited, I'm not getting married.  I was bored at work so I changed my color scheme (again).  I think I really just like playing with colors.  Anyway, I know it is a bit bleak and plain at the moment, but that's what it is.  If anyone has any suggestions, or can help me liven my blog up (using simple instructions, I am NOT a techie), let me know.

      During our discussion in class last night the topic of discrimination came up.  One of my classmates mentioned that someone had said that he didn't believe that someone who is black can be racist, because racism is typically targeted at black people.  My classmate, who is black herself, said she didn't agree with that idea, and I don't think I do either.  Another classmate, who happens to be gay, said she gets upset when gay friends of hers are racist.  She said that she doesn't understand how someone who is part of a group that is commonly discriminated against can legitimately discriminate against another group.  Because someone understands what it is like to be discriminated against, they should have empathy for other groups who are commonly singled out, and should fight against discrimination for all groups.  It made me think about being Jewish, and a target of Anti-Semitism.  I am very lucky, and have rarely been confronted with discrimination because of my religion.  Typically, I am simply met with innocent ignorance, and a lot of honest questions.  Though there have been a couple occasions where the questions or comments came with more malice than curiosity.    I know I am lucky for my lack of negative experiences; growing up Jewish in the South, and the only Jew in my school, was not always easy, but I can not complain about experiencing rampant Anti-Semitic behavior.  While being a part of a minority group has given me a sensitivity about discrimination, and in a lot of ways I think it has helped me develop a distaste for stereotyping other groups, I don't know if my sensitivity is high enough.  I don't know if I feel real empathy towards other minorities.  And I don't know if I personally battle the discrimination that I see towards others as much as I should.  I don't like it when I see it, but I don't know if I actively pursue an end to it.  I guess the question is, should I feel a personal responsibility towards battling discrimination against groups other than my own?  I think the answer is yes, because I believe that if you accept discrimination against any minority, it then makes it much easier to justify any discrimination.  Do I need to get personally and actively involved in ensuring that discrimination does not take place anywhere?  I think that would be an impossible task that I am not prepared to deal with.  However, I think I need to be prepared to speak up against the discrimination that I personally see each day and I think I need to set an example of not discriminating against others.  I think that is the least I can do to fight the justification that many could lobby to discriminate against me.

      I don't post (or even complete) quizzes often, but this one I really like:   urlLink The Book Quiz         You're  Siddhartha !   by Hermann Hesse     You simply don't know what to believe, but you're willing to try anything once. Western values, Eastern values, hedonism and minimalism, you've spent some time in every camp. But you still don't have any idea what camp you belong in. This makes you an individualist of the highest order, but also really lonely. It's time to chill out under a tree. And realize that at least you believe in ferries.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .     What book are you?

      I spent this weekend being surprised, mostly postively, by the people I came into contact with.  It was one of those weekends where everyone I met I saw through a new light, which in a lot of ways was really nice and refreshing.    My feelings at the moment are a bit confused about something and I have been having a lot of trouble sorting it out.  Something is bothering me, but I am not quite sure what.  It might be the fact that the events that I looked forward to this weekend were much less pleasing than those that I dreaded, and the events that I dreaded turned out much better than expected.    I did spend the weekend outside, enjoying the weather, and actually got a bit of color, which was really nice. I was introduced to a new park, and I would love to go back and explore it more (when the cicadas are finished ravaging this part of the country).    I finished the paper I have been working on, and though I can't really say I am proud of it, I know it will be fine.    I started reading a book this weekend that earily pinpointed feelings I have; I feel like the author could have been reading my mind - how does he do that?  I have been thinking a lot about writing on this blog.  I like writing a lot, and I like having this medium to improve my writing.  And I think having a blog has given me motivation to actually write and work on my skills.  But I am still not sure how comfortable I am with having people read my thoughts.  It is definitely a weird feeling, and I am trying to decide if I want to stop airing my thoughts for everyone to see.  On the other hand, I don't know if I would actually write on such a frequent basis if I didn't have a blog.  I will have to weigh my options and see where I come out.

      Apparently I blog like a boy.  I found the  urlLink Gender Genie  (I apologize to whoever I stole this from, because I can't remember) online and plugged in a few of my favorite posts.  The vast majority of them came up as likely to be authored by a male!  I also plugged in posts from a few of my favorite bloggers.  It seems to me that good, formal writing turns up as male, and more casual writing is encoded as being female.  The program must have been written by a man.

      Okay, time to air some of my thoughts about dating (again).  Just some thoughts I have to get off my chest.    Shidduch dating seems to work well for many.  You avoid a lot of the pitfalls of the non-shidduch world - you have an intermediary to help guide you through the process, you are not dependent on meeting someone randomly, and you have similar values and beliefs as the person you are set up with.  However, as a person gets older without getting married the shidduch system seems not to run quite so smoothly.  I think this is for a number of reasons, but at the heart of them, I believe the system encourages singles to halt the development of many of those skills that are so important to a future marriage.  As people get older, their personality matures, and they become more of an individual.  Goals and aspirations are set and interests are pursued.  All of this can make it more difficult to subsequently change gears and begin to think in terms of what is best for more than just oneself.  And the consequence of shidduch dating is that because an individual is not accustomed to taking part in serious relationships, he or she does not necessarily develop the mindset of thinking about someone other than himself.  I am not saying that I think being in a series of serious relationships will positively affect an individual's ability to sustain a marriage, but I do think that a drawback of being an older single in the shidduch system is that you tend not to cultivate the ability to think in terms of more than one's own goals  Another major problem I have with the shidduch system is that it seems very focused on finding a reason to reject someone.  I find that often singles go out with each other searching for negative attributes that they cannot possibly live with. Rather, I feel that they should attempt to find the positive aspects of the other person that may very well complement and enhance their own personalities.  I am completely not exempt from this - I have often found myself thinking that someone seems nice but... I just don't think I could handle this or that.  Rather, I feel I need to be forced to look for the positive traits that the other person possesses and focus on those positives rather than the few negative qualities I can find.  G-d knows guys will be able to find my negative attributes if that is what they choose to look for, so I know I should give them a break as well.  Unfortunately I think this aspect of shidduch dating gets harder and harder as one gets older.  I know that there are things I would have easily accepted in another when I was 20, that I just cannot tolerate now.  And this list tends to get longer and longer as time goes on.  I feel the shidduch world also fosters a lack of maturity when dealing with major life issues.  Hiding behind a shadchan is not a sign of being prepared to confront another person with issues that must be dealt with in a mature and adult fashion.  And I think these skills must be cultivated in order to be able to effectively succeed in marriage.  For someone who does not get married into his late 20's or early 30's, this lack of skills in dealing with another is going to have a negative impact on that relationship.  Like I said, I think the shidduch system works well for many, but those people are mainly the very young, and those who don't yet know themselves well.  Because you are still learning about yourself at the age of 19 or 20, it is often much easier to grow alongside someone else.  But once you move beyond those early-20's, and get more set in your ways, and are given reinforcement by your community to draw a longer laundry list of absolute musts and must-nots, I think the shidduch system begins to fall in effectiveness.    I don't know what the solution is, I think navigating the dating world is difficult no matter how you choose to do it.  But I know that a system that encourages singles to postpone the enhancement of those qualities most important to a successful relationship until they are actually committed for life needs to reevaluate something.

      I had a really interesting conversation last night.  For the past two semesters, one of my classmates is a girl who is a religious Muslim.  Last night we talked a bit about some of our theological similarities, of which there are a surprising number.  She wears what she told me last night is a "hijab," a scarf that covers her head except for her face, and long robes.  She explained the for modesty purposes, she is required to cover everything except her face and hands.  Yesterday she was wearing pants, which she told me she is technically not allowed to do, but sometimes she gets tired of wearing skirts (gee, I don't know what that's like).    I told her about our laws of tznius and how women cover their hair after marriage.  She commented to me that a lot of people ask her if she is married.  She thinks they probably have the association because of Jewish practice.  Muslims also follow dietary laws, though they are not as strict as ours.  No pork, meat must be slaughtered by a believer of G-d (which makes kosher meat okay), though the mixing of meat and dairy is allowed.  Apparently some Muslims feel saying a blessing before eating meat of questionable slaughter is good enough, which possibly explains why I am always asked about my food being "blessed."  She told me that her family typically gets their meat from kosher sources, or her father slaughters it himself.  We talked a little bit about our respective mating rituals.  What she described sounds very similar to Chasidic dating to me.  They have almost identical concepts of yichud, and shomer negiah.  She told me she has a friend who was married at the age of 14, and she was engaged at 16 (though it didn't work out).  She is 19 now, and wants to wait until she is finished with school to get married, though she admitted that she gets pressure from her community to get married now.  It was so interesting to hear about a different culture that has such parallels to my own.  She wasn't at all amazed about the things I told her about Judaism, they were similar to the beliefs she holds.  Sitting next to her in class the past two semesters, we have spoken often about general topics, and occasionally asked a quick question of each other.  But we had never before spoken in such depth about our religious beliefs.  I knew we had a lot in common just because of the fact that we are both more religious than the typical college student at my school, but I didn't realize what depth the commonalities held.  We didn't discuss at all the politics that I am sure would separate us by miles.  I really enjoyed trying to find similarities rather than differences with her.  I find it empowering to be able to connect with someone who many would see as on the opposite side of the spectrum from myself.  I am happy that we were able to see beyond our differences to be able to look for similarities.

      It really is amazing what some sleep mixed with a lot of sunshine will do for a person's mood.  I woke up today with a much better outlook than I have had for the past few weeks.  And that is even besides the fact that I am frustrated with SPSS and didn't finish writing a paper over the weekend.  But the weather is way too pretty to worry about grades these days.  I read King Lear recently and it got me to thinking about some of the themes that Shakespeare commonly uses in his plays.  Shakespeare had amazing insight into some aspects of human nature.  The problem is, I feel like he really had a very negative view of people.  His plays - comedies AND tragedies - are full of deception, misunderstanding, and treachery.  Shakespeare has his characters use disguises, act insane and constantly misrepresent themselves to each other.  Love is often portrayed as a jealous emotion, one that often leads to the destruction of characters.  The only trust shown is usually to those individuals who deserve it the least.  Ok, I know that a normal person's life would hardly make good drama, especially during Shakespeare's time when people wanted fights, confusion and a story line that could carry them away from their boring lives. And I don't think we have changed much in that area.  The best-selling movies are often those that have absolutely no basis in reality.  But I guess I wonder what kind of life Shakespeare actually lived to write such disturbing themes.  I wonder if he saw those around him as people who looked out only for number one, who would stab their father in the back if it served their purpose.  I think there are people who view those around them in this negative light.  Who always expect the worst from those around them.  I have heard enough discussions to feel this is the case.  I think this is a sad outlook on life, and I am sorry for those who view others as steps to climb over in their quest for power, or money, or whatever they feel is important.  But I truly believe that most people do care about more than themselves, and that is why we have families and friends and a social nature.  I feel good when I help another person, when I connect with someone else, when I find common interests with a new person.  They don't have to necessarily advance my status to be valuable to me.    It makes me sad that Shakespeare, with such incredible talent and insight, chose to write plays that are so full of negative themes.  Maybe he felt that was what sold, and he had to make a living somehow.  But it is sad to me that the legacy he left was such a dark one.  It is sad to me that Shakespeare's works are held as some of the greatest writing ever composed, and it shows such a pessimistic side of human nature.  I hope the legacy I leave, while certainly not as influential as Shakespeare's, will be positive.  I hope that I am remembered for the good I saw and brought out in others.  Maybe it won't last as long, but that's fine with me.

      I have been told that I am a "complex" person.  I don't know that I disagree with that, but it makes me wonder if there is such a thing as a "simple" person.   Every person is so complex, so I have problems when I hear someone say, "You are not the average (fill in the blank)."  Because I don't think you can ever point to the average (fill in the blank).  Every person is so unique that you can't pinpoint an average anything.  Though some people definitely seem to fall into place better than others, some people seem to be more easily categorized than others.  So I wonder about complexity and what it means to be complex.  When people tell me I am complex, I think they mean that they feel that there is a lot that doesn't necessarily come out instantly.  There are layers that I don't always reveal, or possibly ever reveal.  Or maybe I haven't even figured out some of those layers.  I think a lot of great artists and thinkers throughout history would have been described as complex.  I am not sure someone who is not complex can create what would be considered "great art," whether it be paintings, music or prose.  Someone who manages to create art that transcends time must be a person who has taken the time to try to understand the complexity of life, and being.  But maybe I am wrong, maybe some people just have within themselves the inspiration to speak to generations.  But again, I get caught up by the question of an uncomplex person.  Because we all grow and change every day, and I don't know that one person can ever truly understand someone else.  So how could a constantly changing person not be considered complex?  Maybe there are those who don't dwell as much on issues, or don't take the time to delve into their depths.  But I feel like everyone must be capable of the same complexities, I feel like it is a part of being human.  I wonder what determines whether someone will become "complex" or "simple."  Is it innate, something hot-wired into our brains?  Or is it learned, something that comes from experience?  Maybe those of us who encounter certain experiences in our lives are led to the complex path?  Is complexity something that is inherent in every person, but some have not dug deep enough to explore their inner layers?  Or do some people really have more layers than others?  I am not sure whether the description of complex is meant by others as a compliment or a criticism.  It probably depends on who issues the description.  But I know that if I wasn't the complex person that I am, I wouldn't be me.  I wouldn't be capable of the same aspirations and accomplishments if I didn't dwell on things the way I do.  Would life be simpler if I was less complex?  Maybe.  Would I sleep better if I could learn to supress my deeper layers and not think so much?  Probably.  But would that be better?  I am not so sure.

      Not totally back yet but...  I have decided that I really like being able to eat whatever (kosher) food I want to.  I really miss my music already - talk radio is no substitute.  Thank G-d, my grandmother is doing much better, she is home from the hospital.  My mother reports that the hardest part now is keeping her from doing too much.  I read King Lear over Yom Tov - I couldn't believe how horrible his daughters were to him.  And then I was talking to my father this morning, and as usual, he managed to completely frustrate me.  Kibud Av V'Im has got to be one of the toughest commandments.  I still don't think I was anywhere near as awful as King Lear's daughters though.  And after all that, every Yom Tov what I end up realizing is that I really miss my family and really want to have a family of my own.  I appreciate so much the families who open their homes to me, but seeing all those families together for the holidays has got to be one of the hardest parts of being a baal teshuvah.  I guess it's time to visit Alabama.

      Ok, here is my question for the day, it is something I have been wondering about for a while now.  Hashem punished Adam and Eve for eating of the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.  My question is, how can they be held accountable for eating of the fruit?  I am assuming that before they ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, they didn't know the difference between good and evil.  So how would they have known that disobeying Hashem was wrong?

      Just a few quick words about Pesach...  Pesach is about freedom.  Freedom is an interesting concept.  When you try to define it, you kind of get stuck. Because along with freedom comes responsibility.  And when you are responsible for anything, then you are limiting your freedom in some way.  Pesach is all about freedom.  Pesach celebrates when the Jews were finally free from slavery in Egypt, but in order to free themselves from this slavery, they accepted the responsibility of serving Hashem, of Torah and commandments.  It is an interesting juxtaposition.  Knowledge is similar - because when you have knowledge, you gain freedom - freedom to choose which path you want to take, but there is also such a great responsibility that comes with knowledge, because then you can't ignore the fact that you are making a choice, and you have the responsibility to make the correct choice.    It is sometimes hard to decide whether you want the knowledge that leads to freedom, and choices, because the choices that come about because of the knowledge are not always easy ones.  Just as leaving Egypt came with great hardship and responsibility, but also freedom, we must every day decide whether we want our knowledge, and the subsequent freedom and responsibility that comes with it.  This year, may we all make the correct decisions, accept the responsibility of our freedom, and be able to internalize the messages that Pesach gives us.

      Since Pesach is starting next week, my blogging will be quite curtailed as I attempt to keep up with work and school while having half of my days taken away by Yom Tov.  So I just thought I would quickly throw some random thoughts out.  I started reading  urlLink Fire in a Canebrake: The Last Mass Lynching in America  this week for school.  It is an extremely well-written book, about an extremely disturbing topic.  It absolutely amazes me how hate could have been a platform on which a political candidate campaigned, and won.  I know it shouldn't shock me, because it has happened in so many instances throughout history, but it does.  But as gruesome and horrible as the topic is, the book is absolutely fascinating.  I wrote my counseling paper, which was a big stress lifted off my shoulders (though I still have to figure out my focus for research paper on technology).  It still needs a lot of clean-up, but having the basics down makes me able to breath a lot easier.  Last night in class, we talked about Reality Therapy.  The founder of the theory postulates that mental illness, including psychosis, is a choice that people make for themselves.  We had an interesting conversation about how we didn't agree with it.  It is interesting to me that the founder of the theory, who supposedly was in the profession of helping people, would come up with such a frustrating view of mental illness.  I can't imagine that telling clients who were suffering from psychosis that they were choosing to hear voices.  Someone was telling me about Hobbes and how he believed that people are motivated in their actions out of desire to avoid war.  Seems to me that if people desired only to avoid war, they would avoid all interaction with others. I hope he is not correct, because I think it would be depressing to think that the only reason people do anything for anyone else is to save themselves.    Finally, I want to wish everyone a wonderful Pesach.  The holidays are often the hardest time for so many...I know for myself, it is always difficult spending holidays with someone else's family.  While I am so incredibly grateful to all those families who open their homes to me, and I personally am so lucky to have a family who just expects me to join them on all holidays, it is still hard.  I hope everyone has someone to celebrate with and has an enjoyable Chag.

      I find it very interesting when I meet a person who seems to like animals more than they like people.    I have a co-worker who doesn't get along with most of the people she comes in contact with.  It is rare that I have a conversation with her in which she doesn't point out all the flaws in someone else's character.  She is consistently rude, abrasive and confrontational to those around her.  This woman has very few friends, no intimate relationship, and has been disowned from her family.  She was telling me about a stray cat that someone in our building found.  She told me that tonight she is going to go to the pet store and buy this stray cat food, toys and a bed.  She is then going to come to our office tomorrow, pick up the cat, take it to her vet's office and give her vet $50 to find the cat a good home.  Why is it that she can treat animals so well, but people so poorly?  A possible reason is because animals are easier - they don't talk back, they can't hurt you like humans can, as long as you give them food, they probably won't reject you for being too ugly, or fat, or anything else.  But there is so much that humans can give you that animals can't.  Humans can truly care about you, rather than about their next meal.  Humans give you the interaction that is necessary to go about your life.    Maybe animals are safe, and that is why she can give to them easier than she can give to people.  But I feel like she is really missing out by giving herself to animals rather than people.  I think if she would treat people the way she treats animals, she would have a much easier time getting along with them.

      I feel like I have been posting thoughts on the negative side lately, and the truth is, I have been having a fabulous week off from school, so my posts have not really been terribly representative of my life.  I was at home yesterday, after a great workout at the gym (it is amazing what I have time for when I don't have school), and there was a knock on my door.  It was one of my neighbors, she wanted to invite me for a Shabbos meal.  Unfortunately, I already had plans for my Shabbos meals this week.  But it struck me how amazing the frum community is when it comes to hospitality and taking care of people.   I moved to Baltimore two years ago, and I have never once had to make a Shabbos meal myself because I could not find a place to go for a meal.  Usually, I have several options, and families invite me along with several of my friends.  Within a few months of moving to Baltimore, I didn't necessarily feel like I knew a lot of people, but I definitely felt welcomed into the community and I felt that people sincerely were happy that I chose to move here.  My apartment complex has a list with everyone's phone number on it that they give out, they welcome new arrivals with balloons and door signs, and they host speakers periodically.  If someone is in need of a Shabbos meal, there is a person designated who you can call who will find a host (though I am lucky to have never needed this service).   I find this to be a huge difference from moving into a community at large.  When you move into a Jewish community, you have a network of options to meet and build friendships that I don't think you find elsewhere.  I think this is the reason why people are so attached to their jobs, because that is the place that they find human connection, it is hard to find it elsewhere, it is difficult to break into a social circle and develop contacts randomly.  I am extremely grateful to the amazing show of hospitality that is extended in the frum community.  It made my transition to Baltimore so much easier than it would have been otherwise.  And I don't think this is specific to Baltimore - I think that is what is so incredible about being a part of the great nation that is Judaism - you are part of a worldwide community.

      I don't want to make this a blog focused on complaining about dating, but I just don't get it.  People I know are constantly telling me how much they would like to see me get married, soon.  But when it comes down to actually giving me the opportunity to meet single guys, the Orthodox world seems to make it incredibly difficult.  How am I supposed to find guys I am interested in when I am not allowed to sit at a Shabbos table with single guys?  Why must I only be invited alongside other girls?  What is wrong with single men and women having a nice meal together at the house of a married couple?    Recently, some people here in Baltimore started an organization,  urlLink Segulah , with the mission of bringing marriage-minded singles together at a Shabbos table.  The thought was that if you met someone you were interested in, great!  If not, you could always keep the people you met in mind for your friends.  I thought it was a great idea.  Unfortunately, those who put Segulah together are leaving Baltimore, and as far as I know, no one has stepped in to take their place in coordinating the program.  What I don't understand is why it takes an organization to do something like this.  I assume that most couples, being made up of a male and a female, know both singles guys and girls.  Why don't they invite them at the same time?  At 26 years old, I think I am mature enough to sit at a table and carry on a conversation with a male, whether I am interested in him or not.  I think I know better than any shadchan what I am looking for in a guy, and I will probably recognize it when I see it in person, rather than during a conversation with a reference who is undoubtedly going to give me a description of the guy that makes him sound like every other guy out there.  I think it is time to give singles who are assumed to be ready for marriage a little credit for being able to handle being in the same room with people of the opposite sex.  Instead of worrying so much about setting up two people you barely know, go ahead and introduce them and see what happens!  Okay, ranting over.  Sorry about that.

       urlLink Protocols  has been inviting a series of guest bloggers to post their thoughts for the past few weeks (some have been better than others, but that is a different story).  The current guest,  urlLink Daniel Radosh  defines himself as a Humanistic Jew.    I don't know very much about Humanistic Judaism, and I am not endorsing it, but I thought that something Radosh said was interesting.  He wrote:   urlLink "God does not care what we think about him, he cares how we treat each other."    I am not sure how I feel about that.  I think treating others with respect should be a high priority, and unfortunately, I believe that it is one that often gets hidden behind concern about bugs in water or particular forms of dress.  I wonder, however, if the second half of Radosh's statement is viable without some kind of belief in Hashem.  If we show a blatant disregard for the laws Hashem gives us, many of which correspond directly to how we relate to others, then what gives us a basis for treating others well?  Radosh also writes about building bridges between the various denominations of Judaism.  I would love to see this also, I have always felt that strengthening our Ahavas Yisrael is the best way to encourage more Jews to love Torah.  Though, again I do not propose to know the best way to balance between being accepting of all Jews and telling those Jews that it is okay to not follow Hashem's laws.  I was once asked what would change in my life if it was proven that there is no G-d.  Would I act differently or live my differently, and in what ways?  My quick answer was that it would change a lot - how I dress, what I eat.  But beyond that, I am not sure that the way I treat others would change tremendously if there was so G-d, or halacha.  I think this is the point of humanistic Judaism, though I am not exactly sure why they choose to emphasize the Jewish part, if they don't accept Hashem.   I hope that my actions towards others would be just as kind, and compassionate as they are now if there was no G-d.  But I have to admit that I like having the backing of halacha, and Hashem, behind me to confirm that I am acting correctly.  And whether Hashem cares what we think of Him or not, treating others well as being a part of serving Hashem, makes sense to me.

      When I first moved to Baltimore, my maintenance man was George.  We loved George.  He was extremely nice and effecient and he even cleaned up after himself.  Then the apartment complex decided that George needed to work on the other side of the complex and the powers that be took George away from us (I still haven't gotten over it - can you tell?).  Since George was stolen away, we have received a new maintenance man.  He is okay, but not as quick, or friendly, or effective as George was.  But he generally does fix what we need fixing without too much of a problem.    Yesterday, I called maintenance and asked them if they could fix my showerhead, which was spraying water up onto the ceiling rather into the shower where it should have been going.  No problem, they would fix it.    After work, I actually stopped at the gym and worked out for the first time in ages.  When I got home, all I wanted was to get clean in my newly fixed shower.  I get to my bedroom door, which is what lies between me and my refreshing shower (my bathroom is inside my bedroom), and it is locked.  This is odd, because in the two years since I moved to Baltimore, I have never once locked my bedroom door.  Since it is after hours, I call the maintenance emergency line.  After waiting on hold for five minutes, they inform me that they charge $25 for lock-outs.  I patiently explain to them that I will not be paying a maintenance man to let me into the room that he locked me out of.  They tell me they will see what they can do.  While waiting for them to call me back.  I come to the realization that I do in fact own a screwdriver and am perfectly capable of taking the doorknob off all by myself.  Which is what I do.  And I put it back on without breaking it.  Who needs maintenance anyway?  Maybe I should become a maintenance man!  Anyway, moral of the story is, I still miss George, who would never have locked me out of my room to begin with.

      In talking to a friend recently, she made a comment regarding the difficulty of being taught to think for yourself and be an individual.  She said that it is both one of the greatest gifts to be given and one of the hardest burdens to hold at the same time.  I totally agree with her.  I sometimes wish I could just go along with the crowd, accepting what everyone tells me I should think, doing what everyone says I should do.  Maybe life would be easier that way - but maybe not.  When you try so hard to fit in, I think you often feel as if you will never live up to whatever standard you are striving to emulate.    So is it better to be an individual or better to not be?  I think that in striving to be an individual you often find out who you are more clearly than someone who tries to fit in.  But the problem with that is that you often figure out that you are not like others, and that can be extremely lonely.  When you try to fit in, you will find yourself surrounded by others who think similarly to you, and hold similar thoughts as yourself.  But you might also find yourself to be hollow, and devoid of an opinion of your own, of a knowledge of who you really are.  And when the tide turns, you better be ready to turn with it, or else all the effort exerted in fitting in has been wasted.  I see people who try incredbly hard to fit into a group or situation that is not really who they are, it is simply who they feel they  should  be, and this ends up being a great source of frustration.  Can you have both?  Can you both be an individual and find a place to fit in?  I don't know.  I hope that those who choose to be individuals, even if they don't ever feel like they fit in, can at least find a group of people to surround them who support them in their efforts to be true to themselves, even if those efforts are not the popular route.  And I hope those who do strive to fit in feel they are at the same time being honest about who they are.  I don't believe that there is a right way for everyone, I think each person needs to figure out which is best for him or herself.  And I think personally, I need to work on accepting everyone for the decision that he or she makes in this endeavor.

      There has been a lot of hype over the past week about wigs made with Indian hair and how Jewish women should not be wearing them because the Indian women cut their hair off in an act of avodah zara (idol worship).  Regular wig-wearers have been frantic trying to figure out whether their wigs are made with Indian hair, rumors have been flying, and there has been major commotion made about this situation.  I was told that some rabbeim are saying that if your wig comes from a non-Jewish source, then you can not trust that they are telling the truth about that hair not being Indian.  You should assume that the non-Jew is lying and you are not allowed to wear that wig.  If the source is a Jewish one, then it is fine to trust them.  I have a major problem with this.  It makes me start to understand why the world hates Jews.  If we look at everyone else with suspicion, why should they not look at us with the same suspicion?  I have heard many times that you should always be careful about accusing someone of a flaw, because when you point with one finger, you have four fingers pointing back at yourself.  I don't blame Jews for Anti-Semitism, and I definitely don't in any way justify the atrocious acts throughout history which so many nations have used to pour their wrath upon the Jews.    But I have to think that in some ways, we make the situation worse for ourselves.  I have sat at many tables where I am embarrassed to listen to the beratement and negativity thrown toward non-Jews as a lump group not distinguished individually in any way.  And I have to wonder why the rest of the world shouldn't do the same to us.  I often see Jews assuming the worst about those we don't even put an effort into finding out about.  What right do we then have to expect that those same people should give us the benefit of the doubt, or put any effort into finding our positive traits?  I believe that you should strive to give as much or more as your expect from others.  And I think that the attitude that one personally exudes in turn is reflected back.  I would rather people not assume the worst of me, so I want to strive for the same about others.

      Yay!  I survived another semester of school.  A review of some of what I learned (including a few I learned in class):  My social life  is  important.  No matter how busy I am, I need to make time for my friends, to keep me sane.  Working full-time while going to school is hard.  Sometimes, I can't read every single word I am assigned and that is okay as long as I am doing the best I can.  I do not have to be perfect.  A few kind words can make a huge difference in a person's day.  From my counseling class - I do not want to be a therapist, though I can develop my own approach to counseling fairly effectively, at least well enough to write an A paper.  I can't control what others do, and how honest other people are.  I need to focus on being the best person I can be.  Asking for help is not a bad thing.  From my writing class - Titles of papers should be interesting.  In each sentence, pronouns should singular or plural, not a mixture of both.  From my Research Methods class - I have learned the rules of APA style in and out, along with the capability to use the APA manual.  This will definitley be a huge help when I leave Pscyhology as soon as I finish my BA.  The people who surround me are proud of me and believe in me.  And that is a great feeling.

      I just had the best 45-minutes of my week so far (yes, I know I am lacking that thing most people call "a life").  Today, instead of eating my lunch in our breakroom like I usually do, I walked across the street and spent my lunch break in my newly-formed ritual - now very affectionately known as "Sunbathing at the Inner Harbor" (extremely loosely disguised as "studying for my final exam tonight").  Basking in the sun, feeling the warmth of its rays, the cool, light breeze flowing past - that's what I call a lunch break.

      Sometimes I wish I cared a lot less about doing what is right.  I also wish people wouldn't tell me about their ethical dilemnas, subsequently making me a part of them, though I guess I should feel honored that these people trust me enough to talk to me.    I wish I knew where to draw the line between what is an okay breach of ethics and what isn't.  But I have a feeling that the line doesn't really exist, that you have to take each case on a step-by-step basis.    I am glad that I have people who I can trust to talk to and advise tell me as to what is the right thing to do with these issues.  But unfortunately, having an answer and coming to a decision about how to act doesn't necessarily make things feel better, it only outlines the action that I am planning on taking.  I guess that's life.

      Yay!  Blogger has new templates and one of them, as you can see, is my favorite color - blue!  So now my blog has had a facelift that is not dependent on me, and it looks so pretty.    I had an incredible weekend.  The weather was absolutely beautiful, so I spent the majority of the time outside, enjoying it before the cicadas come.  I went on a hike that was a great workout, then I had a barbecue, hibachi-style, with some friends in honor of Lag B'Omer, and I ended the weekend with a nice walk through my neighborhood.  It was sad that the weekend had to end, but I am glad that I got the opportunity to make the most of my weekend.  Wish me luck on my finals this week - I'm almost done!

      Another anecdote from my past…  From the time I was 7 until the time I was 13, my family lived in Oklahoma City.  The Jewish community there was very small, and not especially centralized.  There were Reform and Conservative shuls, and a Solomon Schecter day school, but absolutely no Orthodox influence in the community.    My family lived in an area that afforded us a very good public education, and I usually one or two other Jewish students in my grade.  However, my friends tended to come from religious Protestant backgrounds, and were primarily Baptist.  Being open-minded and liberal, my parents would let me go to church with my friends when I was invited, which wasn’t especially often, but did occur occasionally.  Several of my friends were very active in their churches, and spent one or two evenings during the week there, participating in the youth groups that were offered.  Each year, the main Baptist church that my friends were associated with held the “Crusades” – a week-long effort to convince as many people as possible to be “saved,” or to accept Jesus as their savior.  After the services, pizza was served to everyone and a band played for the enjoyment of the crowd.  Being a naïve 11 or 12-year old, I accompanied my friends one year to their “crusade.”  It sounded like fun – who turns down free pizza and music?  I didn’t know what the word crusade meant, I had no idea what being saved symbolized, and to me, it was an opportunity to hang out with my friends.  Sitting through the preaching, watching many people approach the altar to accept Jesus into their lives, I watched with fascination.  It seemed to be such a spiritual moment for so many, a spirituality that I had never experienced.  I whispered to my friend next to me, asking her if I should go up and be saved.  She encouraged me, but cautioned that it wasn’t a decision I should make lightly.  I didn’t really understand what was going on, what it meant to be saved, but there was something about it that seemed very appealing.  I wasn’t saved that day.  Something kept me from walking up to the front of the church, probably something to do with the fact that I didn’t fully understand what it meant.  And after that day, despite my friends’ periodic pleas with me to save my soul from being doomed to an eternity in hell, I never again had the compulsion to be saved.  Years later, reminiscing on that evening in the Baptist church watching other people being saved, I can only draw a comparison to what I feel was my spiritual awakening approximately 7 years later - steps away from the Kotel, watching the sun set as thousands of Jews sang in the beginning of my first traditional Shabbos ever.

      So, for the past few months, talk has been floating around about  urlLink cicadas  that apparently infest and inflame Baltimore every 17 years for six weeks in the most beautiful part of summer.  These large insects with red eyes that devour the landscape and torment those of us with low tolerance for anything yucky are scheduled to appear any day now.  Which of course, leads me to ask myself, "Why did I move to Baltimore?"    Since I have lived in Baltimore, we have experienced a few natural disasters - a  urlLink record-breaking blizzard  my first winter living on the Eastern Seaboard, a spectacular  urlLink hurricane  that left me without power for an entire week, and of course, the impending cicada invasion.    Several people have tried to blame me for the recent disasters that have stricken Baltimore, and while I feel guilty for a few seconds, I try to reason that they would have occurred whether I was living in Baltimore or not.  I try to accept responsibility for those things that I am actually responsible for, but weather crises and insect infestations, I just cannot claim that I have control over.  I guess I will never know why I moved up the coast right before some of the worst calamities that Maryland has seen, but I guess I have been duly inaugurated to living in a place where anything can happen.  I just hope that the cicadas are the last thing I have to live through for a while!

      Being one of the few (or only) Jewish students in my classes growing up, it was always deemed my responsibility to educate my classmates about Judaism.  Whenever any Jewish holidays rolled around, and actually, when non-Jewish holidays arrived also, I got lots of questions.  Lots of contrasts were drawn between Jewish and Christian holidays.  Traditions were traded, presents were compared and stories were told.  The time of the year when these education sessions became the most prominent was always around Chanukah.  Chanukah was always a hard time of year for me.  When young, the hard part came in feeling left out when we inevitably made Christmas projects to take home.  I was either left to make whatever kind of project I desired, or made exempt from the project.  Whichever choice I made, I couldn't fit in with the rest of the class.  Christmas songs were sung in choir, the better years the majority of the songs revolved around winter rather than Christianity, a token Chanukah song sometimes made it into the rotation.  But this time of year also held a fun element.  Each year when I was in elementary school, my parents would come in during Chanukah, sometimes with the one or two other Jewish parents of students in my grade.  All the students in my grade would get together and my parents would tell them the Chanukah story of the Maccabees and the miracle of the oil in the Beis Hamikdash.  My parents would bring in menorahs to light, dreidles to spin, and would fry latkes for everyone to taste.  I always felt special during this presentation, because I knew the information that my parents were presenting, and I often got to help in the demonstration.  I always got positive comments from my classmates about how interesting the story was, and how lucky I was to celebrate eight nights of Chanukah rather than one day of Christmas.  To me, it was about being proud of my difference and sharing it with my classmates and friends.  For an afternoon during that winter season, I didn't feel left out, I felt honored.

      Ok, so at the suggestion of a  urlLink friend , I have decided that I am going to start writing a bit about what it was like to grow up Jewish in the South.  In thinking about the places I've lived and the Jewish communities I have been exposed to, I don't know that my experience is even representative of what most other Jewish Southerners find, but I feel like I do have some interesting stories to tell, and I guess it is time to start sharing.  First a bit of background.  Growing up, my family moved around a lot, not always in the South.  I was born in El Paso, Texas, and before the age of 13, my family moved to Portland, Oregon; Vancouver, British Columbia; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and then we finally settled in Birmingham, Alabama.  While these cities are very diverse in location, they all have one thing in common - they are home to small Jewish communities.  The only places I really have strong memories of living in are Oklahoma City and Birmingham, both of which can be considered to be part of the Bible Belt.  The reason we moved around so much is not because we are a military family, as most people assume.  My father works in the Jewish communal services field - he is currently the Executive Director of the  urlLink Levite Jewish Community Center  in Birmingham.  We moved around as my father changed positions within the Jewish communal services field.  Moving from community to community, I knew few others Jews well, and had even fewer Jewish friends.  The schools that I attended could claim anywhere from a few Jews to only one, me.  The truth was, I always felt I had more in common with my non-Jewish classmates than I did with the other Jews I encountered.  The Jews I knew growing up were largely materialistic, snobby and focused on appearance much more than substance.  Though it is a great possibility that I didn't give a lot of them enough of a chance because I simply wasn't around them enough.  Forced Sunday School classes doesn't really give you a great forum for getting to know people.  My family always affiliated with a Reform congregation, I went to Sunday school for years (against my weekly protests) and we attended services on High Holidays or for simchas.  My Jewish education was pretty weak, though I did learn to read Hebrew and had a Bat Mitzvah where I read from the Torah.  Often being the only Jew in my class or even in my school gave me a unique perspective on being Jewish.  I guess I always had the choice of whether to be embarrassed or proud of being Jewish.  But I think the fact that my family was so involved in the Jewish community, with my father being a spokesperson for whichever community we lived in, led me to feel that my Jewishness was a unique aspect of me that many others couldn't boast.  I always saw it as something that made me who I was, even if I didn't have a clear understanding of the history of the tradition of Judaism.  It was something that I was taught to stand up for and represent proudly and I strove to do that.  I think that my choice to be proud of my difference is what gave me the foundation to eventually learn more about what that difference meant.  And I will always be grateful for having that foundation.

      Lately, I have been compiling a list of people who I really like, and  urlLink Greg  and  urlLink Peninah  have definitely been added to that list.  It was great to spend Shabbos with them, and I hope to see them a lot in the future!   urlLink Rabbi Gottlieb  gave a great drasha this week.  I know I am not going to give it justice, but I want to try.  Rabbi Gottlieb spoke about being a kiddush Hashem to those around us.  He specified that he was speaking about those who are not only a part of the Orthodox community, or even a part of the Jewish community, but everyone, Jewish and non-Jewish.  He said that a part of bringing kedusha into our lives is to live it and project that example onto others.  He emphasized the necessity of not sheltering ourselves from the outside world, because if we keep only to those who are exactly like us, then we are not leading by example.  In not leading by example, there is then no way for others to be inspired by the holiness that we strive to embody. I thought it was an important message and I hope that I can internalize enough kedusha myself to be a kiddush Hashem and inspiration to those whom I come in contact with.  We had an interesting discussion in my Counseling class the other night.  The topic was Feminist Therapy, which is one approach to counseling that has developed fairly recently in response to the increasing dissatisfaction among women with the role that society tends to enforce.  It was an interesting discussion, if a little one-sided (being a Psych class, we only have one male in the class).  The basic premise of the theory is that women (and men, to an extent) have been repressed by the gender roles that society says men and women need to fit into.  The therapy instructs the client that it is not necessary to fulfill these stereotypical gender roles and that problems that they may feel they have are often due to the messages society sends rather than with the client herself.  I brought up the point that many women are very happy, and choose to live, within the traditional gender framework that society holds.  And the point that a woman who is happy within the traditional gender framework who comes to therapy may be very turned and unhappy with a therapist who tells her that her problems are due to the messages that society has been sending her about her gender role.  Also, I don't believe that someone who chooses to live within a traditional role should be made to feel bad about it, she should be supported in whatever choice she makes for her life.  I am still a bit torn about where I stand on the issue of Feminist Therapy, as I do believe that women should not be told that they should not strive to achieve.  But on the other side, I don't agree with the concept that a traditional role should not be respected as a legitimate choice either.  And I think that a Feminist orientation to therapy unfortunately only supports a woman who rejects traditional roles, which I believe is antithetical to the basis on which the theory was built.  I guess I am not going to become a Feminist Therapist any time soon!

      It is amazing how timely those smacks come.  Last night I was smacked by my idealism once again, and it made me wonder, as I have often wondered, "Is Ignorance Bliss?"    We set up illusions in our head because we don't want to know things, and when those things that we don't want to know are confirmed, it is hard to take.  Would we be better off living with the illusion?  The truth is, as much as I often want to live with the illusion, I do think we are better off knowing the truth.  And I think Hashem really gives us the truth only when we are going to be capable of dealing with it, when we have grown enough so that we can use the tools we have to turn the situations into something we can learn and grow from.  I also think that Hashem gives us these truths when we really need to learn something.  Yudel wrote to me yesterday:   "[W]e have to recognize that, as a People, we Jews are unique.  This is not to undermine peoples of other nationalities, races, or ethnicities.  Hashem creates us all.  But we know from the Torah that Hashem made a special covenant with the patriarchs, with Avraham Avinu, and thereby singled out their progeny - us - for a special destiny, marked by a closeness to Him, by our acceptance and observance of the Torah, and by inheritance of Eretz Yisrael - to mention some of the more pivotal items.  He took us out of Egypt to make good on the promise He'd made to our forbears and brought us into the holy land.  It's all there, explicit and spelled out in the Torah.  That you and I are Jews is not an irrelevant accident of fate; it's deliberate and purposeful.  More than anything else, we want to be faithful to our Jewishness.  The WORLD depends on it."   After my smack yesterday, I see so clearly what Yudel is saying.  That Hashem has given us the Torah is such an amazing thing, and we are so lucky to have it, and to live by it as best we can.  It is such an amazing guiding light for us, to give us a road to march down, and to follow the path that Hashem wants us to follow.  Other people just don't have that road to be guided by.  I struggle a lot about whether it is right or not to say that Jews have a special purpose, but I now see the importance of it, and what a difference it does make.  We are special, and I thank Hashem so much that He cares about us to give us His Torah.  I am sorry I needed the smack, but as hard as it is to take, I can already see why it was given to me.  I do NOT think ignorance is bliss, because I think you miss a lot of lessons by living with illusion.

      Yudel's response to my comments below:   It's a fact of life that we, the Jewish people, are the "am hanivchar," the chosen people.  However much the Western tradition clamors to extol the virtues of Equality, we know better than to believe that everything is equal.  G-d created the world.  He created animate and inanimate objects.  He created vegetative objects and animal creatures.  He created the animal kingdom and He created man, endowing him with speech and the ability to reason.  Among men, He chose Israel and conferred upon it a distinct historical destiny.  Within the Jewish people, He separated out the kohanim, the priestly class, giving them exclusive privileges vis a vis the performance of holy service.  The world is very much hierarchically arranged; it is the way it is meant to be.  Perhaps it is intended to reflect the ultimate division of stature: that between the Creator and the created.  However much we managed to equalize things, people, etc on this earth, this transcendental "inequality" would always remain elusive, untouchable.  It's a fact of life!  The Jewish people have been endowed with an unmatched Divine identity.  Actualizing it is the truest fulfillment of liberation.  For this reason, no one but a Jew can claim this form of freedom for himself.  It's life - whose secrets are so deep.  May we merit to live and to understand.    I like what he says above.  I definitely can look around at the people I know and acknowledge that each of us has our unique gifts and potentials to actualize.  And I think it would be a disaster to say that everyone is exactly the same and should aim for the same goal and destiny - to do so would be to ignore the amazing gifts that Hashem individually gives to each of us.  Thank you again, Yudel, for your response!  May each of us merit to recognize and fulfill our unique destinies!

      I am an Idealist.  I hold myself and others to such a high standard, often it is difficult to face the realities of how other people see the world.  This is often hit home to me in class discussions.    I am currently writing an essay about whether an engineer who knows a product has a defect should report it or not.  To me, the engineer has a responsibility to whoever is using his product - I could care less about the monetary loss that might be incurred in ensuring that a product is completely safe, or of the best quality.  I was asked to decide how many potential lives lost are worth the cost of reporting and repairing a defect - to me, you can't put a price on life, even one potential life harmed - not lost, but harmed - is worth any amount of money to fix.  Then I was told that companies in the past have decided that they would rather take the monetary damages of a family suing for an injured or killed relative rather than fix a product.  Wow, I was blown away that a company could collectively decide that it would be better to take the risk of being sued rather than take the measures necessary to ensure that no one would be injured in the first place.  Being an Idealist is often very difficult.  I sometimes feel like I get smacked in the face because I can't believe the cynicism with which others live their life.  It disappoints me so much that people view their fellow humans in such a negative light, because if they view others so negatively, I feel it must come because that is how they themselves choose to live.  But then I sometimes wonder which is better - is it better to believe the worst and not get knocked down, or is it better to expect the best and get disappointed?  Personally, I think I would rather expect the best, even though it means periodic disappointment, because at least my outlook on others, even if it is not realistic, is to give the benefit of the doubt, and generally see the good.  Maybe I get hit with negative reality at times, but the other times, I am assuming the best, and I think that makes it worth it.  I would hate to go around seeing everything in a negative light all the time, I think I would rather suffer being disappointed on occasion.    Is this easy?  Not at all, because those times when I am smacked with reality, I do suffer, and each time it is a little bit harder to go on being the Idealist that I think is in my heart.  But so far, I am so lucky - I haven't been smacked enough to let go of my idealism yet.  I hope that I never am.

      I received an e-mail from Yudel and I thought I would share it:   In your blog about Aristotle you were bemoaning what you took to be the fact that people are inexorably enslaved to something or other.  You were groping for a way out.  How does a person keep from being enslaved?  But surely you know, the Tana in Avos says, "Ein lach ben chorin ela mi sheosek betaora."  Freely translated, this says, the only way to be really free is to occupy oneself in Torah.  So you see, there is a way out.  The reason we feel so resigned to slavery as that we detach, or distance, ourselves from our ultimate source and our true identity.  Consequently, our consciousness brings us into communion only with ulterior phenomena.  And the only way to relate to something ulterior is slavishly.  However, as we draw ourselves closer to our source, our true essence of being, we are no longer captivated by something exterior.  For we have FOUND ourselves, truly and deeply.  Now, as we all know, as Jews, what we really are, on the level of soulfulness (i.e., true ultimate essence), are Torah-beings.  Accordingly, in proportion as we forge an identification of ourselves with Torah, the will of Hashem, we release ourselves from the exterior (ulterior) grip.  We become attuned to our inner selves: you and me.  This is true freedom.  So you see, it's so very simple.   I didn't see it as being so simple, so my response was this:   If we can only find our true selves through dedication to Torah, how does that not make us slaves to Torah, and consequently, Hashem?  (By the way, this would not necessarily be a negative form of slavery, maybe it would be a positive form, but I have trouble seeing it as being free from some kind of bondage, which is to me, slavery.)  If Jews have this opportunity to free themselves by delving into Torah, where does that leave non-Jews?  Are they bound by slavery because they are not bound by Torah?  I think Aristotle's views might even coincide with that belief - he seemed to think that some people are natural slaves while others had higher rank and potential.  But I have a lot of problems with that.   Yudel's response:   You get right to the root of the matter.  You intimate that dedication to Torah and subservience to the Al-mighty is a form of slavish bondage.  But as we know, the highest plane of existence we can reach is where we're servants to Hashem.  The Al-mighty Himself refers to Moshe Rabeinu as "avdi"...My servant.  And the Torah exhorts us not to subject a slave of our brethren to abject labor, by declaring "Ki avaday hem," "For they our My slaves," and therefore they (the Jewish people) must not be treated slavishly by us.  Clearly, the point of it all is that we submit ourselves unreservedly to His will.  Yet, as we saw, the Tana in Avos characterizes this as freedom!  The way I've tried to explain it is to say, true freedom is self-actualization. When someone is encumbered from actualizing himself, he suffers from a lack of freedom.  When someone is forced to do something against his will, he isn't actualizing himself.  He isn't acting from the authentic root of his true identity, his essential being.  We Jews...we're so holy and so special. By our very definition, we are receivers of Torah.  We are acceptors of the will of Hashem.  Our very inner being is entwined with this.  Consequently, for us to willfully embrace Torah and embrace the way of life He has ordained for is - this IS for us to exercise an act of freedom.  Because this puts us in touch with our deepest essence.  And nothing can be freer than that!  Usually, subservience is to something extraneous to us; so it drives us away from ourselves (as it were).  But in this instance, it takes us back to who we really are and where we come from.  It takes us to where we are destined to go.  Secular, scientifically minded philosophers just aren't on our wave length. So they trouble themselves endlessly with the "Free Will-Determinism Problem."  So much the worse for secular,  scientifically minded philosophers.  Nebach.  Maybe this sheds some light on the situation with non-Jews, too.  To the extent that they don't engage in self-actualization, they are indeed enslaved.  When they pander to their baser instincts and relentlessly pursue hedonistic goals, they fail to actualize themselves as human beings, created in the image of Hashem.  They are acting slavishly.  They don't possess a Torah-essence as we do; so they lack the potential for the ultimate freedom that pertains to us.  But within their own plain of existence, there is room to succeed  and to falter/succumb.  So there's a wide spectrum for them to vary on, ranging from the decrepitly earth-bound to the sublimely free.    I still need to think about what he says a bit more - I like the thought that our self-actualization through Torah leads to personal freedom.  However, I have trouble with the concept that non-Jews would not be given the same opportunity as we are - I believe Hashem loves all of us, Jewish or non-Jewish, and would not create some humans without the chance for true freedom.  And I would love to throw the Free-Will/Determinism debate away, because it is something that bothers me a lot, but I am not positive it is so easy.  Thanks for your thoughts, Yudel!

      I have been thinking a lot about perspective lately, and how a different perspective can make such a huge difference in the evaluation of a certain circumstance or experience.  It is amazing to me how I can read something and take from it something completely different than someone else.  Often in my classes, when I talk about something I feel the author is saying, classmates disagree and feel that the author was saying something opposite.  I think much of it is a matter of our personal histories and biases clouding how we interpret what we experience.  Two people can go through an experience together, and then go away with two completely different views on what just occurred and what was important about what happened.  And the even wilder thing is that neither of those views are probably completely accurate about what happened.  Both people probably missed some details and information during the experience.  I think we have to work hard on expressing ourselves and our reflections in order to be able to come together and be able to live peacefully.  I think often people want to stick to their impression of things and refuse to budge even when faced with evidence that their view of things might be off.    Thomas Hobbes felt that humans are naturally in a state of war, that each of us only cares about himself and feels he is entitled to everything.  On the other hand, Hobbes also believed that we are all equal.  Instead of equality being something that tears us apart, I would rather see it as something that brings us together.  Because we recognize that we have so much in common, we should strive to understand and connect to others in order to bring about peace for all of our sakes - not just for the preservation of our own lives.

      The weekend was absolutely beautiful.  I spent it in great conversation with good friends, enjoying the gorgeous weather and relaxing as much as possible while trying to read everything I needed to for school.  For school, I had to read an excerpt from  urlLink Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan .  Hobbes writes about natural laws, though I couldn't discern whether the he feels that the natural laws he speaks of are actually in effect, or need to be effect for society to work properly.  The part I really had trouble with, however, is that Hobbes believes that people are in a perpetual state of war, against one another.  He feels that if people were not worried about their own lives, then they would kill everyone else, because that would be to their benefit, they would then be able to have whatever they wanted.  But fortunately, we are all afraid of others killing us, so we don't kill them, and therefore we live in a state of peace.  What troubles me so much about this is that Hobbes doesn't leave much room for friendship, love for other people, or empathy between humans.  (It makes me wonder if he had any satisfying relationships in his life.)  His outlook is so stark, and without a sense of human connection, I feel he misses what makes humanity what it is.  Yes, humans differ from animals because of their ability to reason, but I think we also differ because of our ability to care for one another, and feel real emotion and love for others.  I don't feel that I don't murder others because I am afraid of retribution, I feel I don't kill others because I have a real respect for human life, other people's as well as my own.    Reading philosophy like Hobbes always makes me a little sad, because I think it takes our humanity away, and turns us into animals, while I think the point of philosophy is that we are so much higher than other animals.  I hope Hobbes is wrong about us.

      By Rabbi Yitzchok Feigenbaum  ---------------------------------------  T'was the night of the geulah, and in every single shteibel, sounds of Torah could be heard, coming from every kind of Yeidel.  This one in English, some in Hebrew, some in Yiddish, some saying pshat, and some saying chiddush.  And up in shomayim, the Aibishter decreed, "The time has come for My children to be freed.  Rouse the Mashiach from his heavenly berth, have him get in his chariot and head down to Earth."  The Moshiach got dressed, and with a heart full of glee, went down to the Earth, and entered the first shteibel he did see.  "I'm the Moshiach, Hashem has heard your plea, your geulah has come, it is time to go free!"  They all stopped their learning, this was quite a surprise, And they looked at him carefully with piercing sharp eyes.  "He's not the Mashiach!" said one with a grin, "Just look at his hat, at the pinches and brim!"  "That's right!", cried another with a grimace and a frown, "Whoever heard of Mashiach with a brim that is down?!"  "Well", thought Mashiach, "If that is the rule, I'll turn my brim up before I go to the next shule!"  So he walked on right over to the next shule in town, confident to be accepted since his brim was no longer down.  "I'm the Mashiach!", he cried as he began to enter. But the Jews there wanted to know first, if he was left, right, or center.  "Your clothes are so black!" they cried out in a fright. "You can't be Mashiach -- you're much too far right!  If you want to be Mashiach, you must be properly outfitted." So they replaced his black hat with a kipa that was knitted.  Wearing his new kipa, Mashiach went out and he said, "No difference to me what I wear on my head."  So he went to the next shule, for his mission was dear, But he was getting a bit frustrated with the Yidden down here.  "I'm the Mashiach!" he cried, and they all stopped to stare. And a complete eerie stillness filled up the air.  "You're the Mashiach?! Just imagine that. Whoever heard of Mashiach without a black hat?!"  "But I do have a hat!" the Mashiach then said. So he pulled it right out and plunked it down on his head.  Then the Shule started laughing, and one said, "Where's your kop? You can't have Mashiach with a brim that is up!  If you want to be Mashiach, and be accepted in this town, put some pinches in your hat, and turn that brim down!"  Mashiach walked out and said, "I guess my time hasn't really come, I'll just have to return to where I came from.  So he went to his chariot, but as he began to enter, all sorts of Jews appeared, from left, right, and center.  "Please wait, do not leave, it's all THEIR fault!" they said And they pointed to each other, and to what was on each other's head.  Mashiach just looked sad, and said, "You don't understand." And then started up his chariot to get out of this land.  "Yes, it's very wonderful, that all of you learn Torah, But you seem to have forgotten, a crucial part of our mesorah."  "What does he mean? What's he talking about?" And they all looked bewildered, and all began to shout.  Mashiach looked back and answered, "The first place to start, is to shut up your mouths, and open up your heart.  To each of you, certain Yidden seem too frum or too frei but ALL Yidden are beloved, in the Aibeshter's eye."  And on his way up he shouted, "If you want me to come, try working a little harder on some ahavas chinam."

      I was talking to a friend last night about my general level of frustration these days and how I have been considering moving on from Baltimore because of it.  Her point, and it was an excellent one, I have to give her credit, was that moving would not necessarily make a difference in my level of frustration.  In thinking even more about it, I am not quite sure what would make a difference - the various considerations that have been floating around in my head are in no way solutions, and I feel that the things that frustrate me are everywhere.  Being faced with that, I am feeling a bit helpless and aimless at the moment, but in no rush to pick up and change cities.  I guess this is an improvement?

      Lots going on here, and in my mind, which I am never able to shut off, but my thoughts are not quite organized and I am not at this point comfortable with sharing them.  So, I will write a bit about something we discussed in class the other night.  We talked about the canonical view of business.  What the canonical view of business says(at least according to my textbook) is that the aim of society is towards efficiency and that each person looks out mainly for himself only.    My problem with efficiency (and no one in my class seemed to share this concern) is that when you aim for the most gain while putting in the least effort, you lose so much in the way of personal growth and beauty.  If you aim only for efficiency, then who cares about art, or aesthetic pleasures, or meaningfulness?  I think the quality of an efficient life leaves a ton to be desired.  Even in business, I think there is room for considerations off of the efficient path.  But the business majors in my class were adamant - business is about making money, social responsibility is just a consequence and a hindrance that Americans must work around.  The discussion depressed me a bit, my professor said he gets depressed hearing people talk like that, but then he looks around and sees that people don't necessarily  act  like that, and it gives him hope.  I guess I hope that actions speak louder than words, and certainly louder than the canonical view of business.  I hope everyone has a wonderful Shabbos.

      I have to give a speech next week and I have two topics to choose from - either a great place to go on vacation or a "how to" speech.  I thought it would be easy, I would talk about visiting Israel, but oddly enough, someone already took that one.  I thought about Alabama, because I kind of doubt that someone would steal that from me, but I don't know how many highlights I could come up with.  So, I could demonstrate "how to" do something.  But the question is, what?

      No, I'm not going to Los Angeles (that is a place I actually have very little interest ever visiting again - long story).  At the suggestion of a friend, I rented the video  urlLink City of Angels  this past week with  urlLink Nicholas Cage  and  urlLink Meg Ryan , and I definitely think it is worth watching for those who don't like all their movies to be the same.    I am not the hugest fan of Nicholas Cage, but in City of Angels, he really steps up and portrays an angel in all his celestial light.  His eyes speak novels, as do Meg Ryan's.  In general, I think both characters portray that part of life that you feel even when you can't explain why; that feeling of being drawn to another for reasons unknown.  The lesson I liked best about the movie is that you should always appreciate every second you have, and that you should not regret your decisions, no matter the outcome.  The soundtrack really added a lot, and the cinematography was absolutely beautiful.  It was definitely an aesthetically pleasing movie, despite Dennis Franz in a supporting role.  My only warning is if you are not looking to cry, don't watch this one.

      I finished reading  urlLink "Catcher in the Rye"  by  urlLink JD Salinger  this weekend.  It reminded me a bit of  urlLink "The Bell Jar"  by  urlLink Sylvia Plath , mainly in that both authors depict a person going through serious mental problems.  The interesting thing in both is that, the more mentally disturbed the characters are, the more honest and authentic they seem to be.  In the beginning of "Catcher," Holden decries the phonies he constantly seems to come into contact with, while at the same time, he constantly lies and deceives those he meets.  As the book goes on, as Holden gets more and more desperate, he stops lying and starts reaching for those whose company he cherishes.  I think it sometimes takes some desperation to make us realize what is important and who really cares about us.  The other thing that I found so interesting is something that I notice often in people, and that I often wonder about myself also.  Holden constantly criticizes those around him for being phony, and says this is why he can't maintain his presence at a school.  But he lies and is rarely true to himself.  I have often seen people blindly pointing fingers at others for those faults that they themselves embrace.  I wonder sometimes if I do this same thing, and if so, what faults I criticize that I actually have.  As I have often heard said, when you are pointing one finger at others, you have three pointing back at yourself.

      Being in school during the summer is hard.  After having such a nice break, I am having trouble trying to balance my social life and school.  I am resenting school a bit at the moment because it means that I have to be inside in a windowless classroom when I want to be outside enjoying the gorgeous weather.  It doesn't help that I am taking a class that focuses on the business world when I have no interest in business whatsoever.  Stupid required courses.  Oh well, I got myself into it, I have to deal with it.   Last night in class, we spoke about Aristotle's view of happiness being self-sufficient and the ultimate goal that we strive for.  I have to admit that I didn't quite understand everything Aristotle was saying, because he has a tendency to assume that the reader accepts many of his assumptions, and then abruptly change topics.    But I was bothered by the fact that Aristotle seemed to view happiness as the ultimate destination of a virtuous life.  At what cost is happiness so important?  At the cost of other people's happiness?  Aristotle does say that the higher level is that which takes into account the happiness of the entire city-state rather than the individual, but then can you say that everyone is happy?  I feel like doing the right, or virtuous, thing may not always make everyone happy, but it might lead to a better life, in general.  The problem is Aristotle says that happiness is self-sufficient, so it can't possibly be dependent on anything.  But if it is nto dependent on anything, then can it supercede what is right?  I need to do more thinking about this one, but I have to trudge ahead and start reading the next assignments already - this time Aristotle takes on friendship.  I have read it before, but I definitely need a refresher.  Heading to DC for Shabbos, hopefully the weather will hold out so I can walk around the city and hang out near the Mall.  Good Shabbos!

      My class for the summer semester is a required course titled "Ethics for Business and Society."  I have some issues with taking a class geared towards business majors, because I feel that ethics in Psychology has a completely different focus than business.  But I am required to take it (that's what I get for going to the "Career-Minded University"), and I want to graduate, so there you go.  Last night we were trying to determine exactly what ethics are, and if there is a difference between morals and ethics.  From the examples people in my class gave, it is going to be an interesting semester.  Predominantly business and computer science majors, my classmates have a slightly different outlook on many things than I do.  I look forward to the opportunity to hash out my thoughts on many controversial topics that we are going to be discussing - I think the conversations are going to be interesting and probably the topic of a few blog posts. Stay tuned.

      Life really has been beautiful.  I have spent the past few weeks really having quality time with my friends while I had a break from school, and I once again have realized how amazingly lucky I am to have such incredible, supportive people in my life who really make me feel at home so far from my family.  Shavuous was very nice.  I had all my meals with friends, and we made a very nice meal for the first day.  Love that dairy food.  This past Shabbos I made Friday night dinner with two friends and we had a completely relaxed dinner just enjoying each other's company.  Sunday I traveled to New York.  I took the train, which I had never done before.  It was nice to sit back and enjoy watching the country go by.  I spent my day there in Central Park, which I had never been to before.  It was hard to believe that I was in the middle of such a huge, bustling city, because the Park was so incredibly gorgeous.  I strolled around the park, watched people paddleboating, stood on top of a 150-year-old bridge and had a wonderful conversation with someone who really taught me a lot in a few short hours.  I will remember that day for a long time, for many reasons.  It was nice to have some time to just slow down and appreciate the many incredible things I have in my life and the world that surrounds me.  Hashem has created such an amazing world for us to enjoy, I am glad that I took the time to really enjoy it for at least a little while.

      I'd like to write a sonnet, but I have never been very good at poetry, so I will just try to express how amazing it is to be reunited, at long last, with John Mayer, The Counting Crows, clean laundry and hot showers.   I had no idea how much I missed singing in my car on the way to and from work until yesterday, on my way home, when I finally got the opportunity to once again, sing along with John Mayer's "Comfortable."&nbsp; Slipping into a clean skirt and shirt this morning was delicious.   And taking a long, hot, steamy shower yesterday afternoon, and this morning (and knowing that I can take as many as I want), was such an amazing feeling.   I know it was just three weeks since I last connected with Adam Duritz, Sheryl Crow and the Moshav Band, but my car ride is just not the same without them.&nbsp; I am very happy to be reunited with my long-lost friends.&nbsp; I guess it's true - absence makes the heart grow fonder.

      I have had many people come and go throughout my life.&nbsp; When I look back at those who have made an impact on me, I can see that Hashem always sent the right person to me at the right time.&nbsp; Throughout my years in becoming religious, whenever I was standing in front of a wall, not sure whether I wanted to make the effort to climb it or not, someone new came into my life at exactly the right moment who gave me not only the motivation, but the boost up over the wall.  Spiritually, the past year left me questioning a lot of things.&nbsp; I was introduced to new challenges, and it caused me to think hard about what I wanted out of my life.&nbsp; I was at a really weak point, and Hashem once again sent someone into my life.&nbsp; That person unknowingly gave me the assurance that the path I am on is the right one and the hope to continue traveling along it.  This person is truly unlike any other I have met.&nbsp; His view of life and the things in it always surprise me – I never know what he will say next.&nbsp; He has dedicated his life to helping others, though he keeps his identity disguised to ensure the dignity of those he helps.&nbsp; He puts great consideration into every detail when honoring those he is helping, so they truly feel special and cherished, rather than pitied and shamed.&nbsp; In his daily life, he often sacrifices his own enjoyment for those he cares about, and he is left with little that he does just for himself.&nbsp; In exchange for the great caring that he gives to others, he gets little in return, and is often left feeling alone.&nbsp; He does all of this with an incredibly joyous attitude, with constant gratitude to Hashem.  I am fortunate to have become friends with this person.&nbsp; He has inspired me and taught me a tremendous deal.&nbsp; I initially thought he was coming into my life for a specific reason, but I see now that he had a very different purpose.&nbsp; I am sad because I am not sure how long he will stay a part of life, but I do know that he has made an impact I will never forget, and in that way, he will never leave me.

      Tisha B'Av is the day when Jews commemorate the destruction of both of the Temples.&nbsp; We are supposed to cry for the destruction, and dispersion of the Jews from Jerusalem.&nbsp; While&nbsp;I this is absolutely something that is worthy of our mourning throughout the year, I have to admit that I have a lot of difficulty connecting to it, really feeling sad about the destruction of the Beis HaMikdash.  I usually manage to find some tears on Tisha B'Av, but they are usually not for the right reasons.&nbsp; I can muster up sadness, drawing from my own experiences, but I don't know that they are really because of the exile that we are in today.&nbsp; I watch the videos about the violence in Israel, and feel very strongly for the victims, but I don't know whether I am focused on the appropriate topic.  I find Tisha B'Av a wonderful opportunity to cry, to release the many emotions that plague me throughout the year.&nbsp; But I am always haunted that I am not crying for the right thing, that it is more about me than Klal Yisrael.&nbsp; Fasting often makes it harder - I am focused on my empty stomach, my thirsty palate and my aching head rather than why we are fasting.&nbsp;  This year, I hope that I can focus outward, less on me and more on the Jewish people.&nbsp; Less on my personal nisayons, and more on the fact that Jews can't find it in themselves to like each other and work together.&nbsp; Less on my being alone and more on the fact that we, for some reason, can't live together.

      I am sitting at the Inner Harbor, in my favorite spot, about a foot from the water while I write this.&nbsp; It is cloudy but there is a great breeze and looking at the rippling water always captivates me.&nbsp; Even though there are a lot of people walking around and lots of background noise, there is something peaceful about just sitting here and enjoying the beauty of my surroundings.  I think becoming religious was similar to this feeling.&nbsp; When I went to Israel the first time, my life was not very happy.&nbsp; I was directionless and purposeless.&nbsp; My parents had recently gotten divorced, I had few friends and no one I felt really understood me.&nbsp; I often wondered about the meaning of it all, whether there was a purpose and reason to life.  Then I traveled to Israel and was introduced to Torah and Hashem’s love for us.&nbsp; I was taught that I have a special, unique purpose for being here, that Hashem put me here and gave me all my experiences for a reason.&nbsp; To me, learning that made the background noise fade somewhat and led me strive for that inner peace that I find today sitting at the Harbor.&nbsp; It gave me a solid core inside of knowing that all the hard things I was dealing with were for a reason; they were so I could grow and actualize my purpose.&nbsp; And while those things were, and still are, difficult to deal with, I knew they were happening fir a reason.&nbsp; And eventually, I would be able to look back on them and be thankful that I was given those challenges in order that I could grow.&nbsp;   I still find it incredibly difficult to view the challenges in my life in this way while I am dealing with them, but I try to keep this in the back of my mind and it does make things a bit easier to deal with.&nbsp; So that is a little bit of why I became a baal teshuvah.

      Today I visited the library for the first time in months, and I realized how much I has missed it.&nbsp; The stacks of books, the kids running around, the feeling that I could browse for days and take as many books&nbsp;as I want home with me (the only problem is finding the time to read it all).  Growing up, my father took us to the library each weekend.&nbsp; He was part of a computer club and he would leave us to play with the games, to read books, to play with the computers set up.&nbsp; I would take a huge stack of books home with me each week, and read them all.&nbsp; And then I would read them again.&nbsp; And again.  The library was like home to me.&nbsp; I loved all those books, I loved reading and learning about different things, I loved the fact that the other people there wanted to learn about new things also.  It is amazing to me how many books are our there, on so many topics.&nbsp; I love the idea that the library is there, with so much knowledge, and it is open to anyone who has a thirst for knowledge, at no cost.  There is something there that&nbsp;I can't put my finger on, some incredible energy, maybe brain cells expanding.&nbsp; All I know is, I could live there and never get bored, maybe hungry, but never bored.  So, now I have plenty of reading material, and a rainy weekend ahead of me to look forward to.&nbsp; Have a good Shabbos!

      Sometimes I wish my mind worked like a VCR.&nbsp; If I didn't feel like dealing with something when it came up, I could pause it and handle it later.&nbsp; The Record button would be great for memorializing conversations and I could use Rewind when I want to go back and prove to someone what they said in the past that they are currently denying.&nbsp; The two buttons I would like the most though, are the Fast Forward button and the Power button.   I think most people wish they could have a Fast Forward button.&nbsp; It would be so great to know what is going to happen, it would probably alleviate a lot of stress in waiting to find out so many things.&nbsp; I would love to know when certain things in my life would occur, because then I could stop wondering IF they are going to occur.&nbsp; But I see why that is not possible, because if we can take a peek at everything that is going to happen, it would be harder to strive for growth.&nbsp; And of course free will would be all messed up (but I am not going to start with that one here).  But what I personally would really like is a Power button.&nbsp; I often feel like my brain is working overtime, that I think way too much.&nbsp; I would really love to have the preference of saying to myself, "Ok, enough thinking for today, time to turn off."&nbsp; And I could just turn it off and not think anymore.&nbsp; I think I would even be willing to give up some interaction time to have more non-thinking, sleep-like time (even when I am sleeping, my overactive brain creeps into my dreams, so sleep isn't really an off time).&nbsp; I know I wouldn't be the same person if I could just shut off my brain, and I wonder if I would abuse that power by not giving myself enough time to think.&nbsp; But really, sometimes it would just be nice to have a rest.  If anyone manages to develop a way to transition a brain in to a VCR, will you please let me know so I can be the first in line for one?

      Starting Thursday, I have five weeks off from school.&nbsp; I am looking for reading&nbsp;suggestions.&nbsp; I want to read books that are beautifully written, thoughtful, but easily comprehensible (I don't want to have to think too hard during my break).  &nbsp;  Any suggestions?

      I have had several conversations lately with several different people about the importance and specialness of having a relationship with one's family.&nbsp; It is something that I have been thinking a lot about in the last few weeks since getting the rare opportunity to see my own family.   An incredible emphasis is placed on the family in the frum community.&nbsp; Shabbos, holidays, summers - many occasions are celebrated with one's family.&nbsp; Outside of the frum community also, many milestones and moments are punctuated by the gathering of one's relatives.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I am not especially close with my family.&nbsp; I see them extremely rarely.&nbsp; I talk to my parents a couple times a week.&nbsp; I don't typically share my day to day concerns, worries or issues with them.&nbsp; When I get sick, I take care of myself.&nbsp; I love my family, but we do not have the closeness that I see in many of my friends' relationships with their relatives.  &nbsp;  This has given me some great advantages.&nbsp; I have learned to be extremely independent, to manage things on my own, it has given me confidence that I can support myself and not have to rely on others.  &nbsp;  But lately I have found myself envious of those I see who are close with their families, close both in proximity and in relationship.&nbsp; Independence is a gift, but sometimes I want someone to lean on, who will be there for me.&nbsp; I have friends whose parents drive to see them when they are having a bad week - my parents don't know when I am having a bad week, and even if they did, coming to visit&nbsp;wouldn't be an option.  &nbsp;  I think this ability to support each other is so beautiful about families, and I hope that when I have a family of my own, my children will be able to lean on me and I will be within a drive for them when they are having a bad week.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I think the lesson of independence I have been given is not a bad thing - at some point I think children need to be able to support themselves.&nbsp; But I hope that I will be able to improve upon my own experience and give my children the independence of being on their own, along with the knowledge that I am there to give them the emotional support they need whenever they need it.  &nbsp;  As so many other things, it comes back to balance.&nbsp; It has taken me a long time to realize that while independence is a wonderful thing, too much of it can be detrimental to many aspects of your life.&nbsp; For me, it has meant a distancing from my family that I regret, and a certain type of loneliness from the difficulty I have in asking for help from others, because I don't like admitting that I can't handle something on my own, that I am not totally independent.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I hope that I will learn from my own experience and be able to pass on the right balance to my future family.

      I just finished reading  urlLink "Crossing to Safety" by Wallace Stegner .&nbsp; It was suggested to me as a book written for people who write.&nbsp; And I have to agree, it was absolutely beautiful.   It is the story of two couples whose lives are forever intertwined.&nbsp; It describes love in so many ways - the deep, dependent, absolute&nbsp;love between spouses; the caring, comforting, giving love between friends; and the demanding, expectant love of parents for their children.&nbsp; The couples depicted in the book are far from perfect, but their faults are part of what make them who they are, and what makes the characters love each other all the more.  &nbsp;  The end of the book is a mixture of heart-breaking and uplifting at the same time, if that is possible.&nbsp; The characters lives were not easy, and they consisted on many disappointments, and many what-ifs.&nbsp; But they take everything in stride, and see how the struggles they had to endure actually grew them into something better, if not what they had expected for themselves.  &nbsp;  The book flowed easily, as Wallace Stegner has such a gorgeous way of using words.&nbsp; I could see in my mind the places he describes and the people he depicts.&nbsp; But what is harder, and what he does so well, is makes you feel the emotion and the energy of each scene.&nbsp; He makes you feel you are part of these characters lives, that you are a part of the family.&nbsp; I definitely recommend "Crossing to Safety" to anyone who wants to read about a deep, imperfect, but totally human love between people.  &nbsp;  Have a good Shabbos!

      I wonder sometimes about the value of learning from experience.  Because I believe that each situation must be taken individually, and each person must be related to separately.  I am not sure how much can be learned from experience, especially bad ones.  I am not saying that someone should put their hand down on a hot iron time and time again - that would be silly.  But to generalize about a group of people based on a bad experience you have with one of a group seems silly also.  As in a lot of things in life, I think there has to be some balance.  Rambam, Aristotle, Montaigne - I have read things by all three this year about the art of moderation, or acting upon a mean.  So, I think it can't be all or nothing.  But I wonder what exactly we should learn from and what we should overlook.  Bad things happen and they leave us scarred and scared.  But time heals, and looking back often makes you realize that those bad things are often the greatest growing experiences that you had.  I think the greatest thing I have learned from all my experiences is that Hashem has gotten me through all of them, and has been with me always.  And I think He will continue to give me the experiences I need to learn from.  So I guess at this point, I want to take the good I learn from experiences, and try to put a positive spin on the bad.  I don't want to stop considering each person as an individual, because then I fear I might miss out on some of the amazing people who Hashem puts into my life to enrich it.

      It has been very cloudy in Baltimore over the past few days.  I was sitting out at the Harbor yesterday and looking at the clouds.  My initial reaction when I see clouds is to say how yucky it looks out.  But the truth is, the sight of clouds really fills me with a bit of awe; they really are pretty cool looking.  When I was little I used to look up at the clouds and imagine all kinds of shapes in them.  I would see people and animals and objects.  I would imagine whole stories about the things I saw in the sky.  I haven't taken the time to do that in quite a while.  On my drive to work today, I was thinking more about the function of clouds - how they hold the rain that the earth needs to grow and flourish.  Rain has never really bothered me (especially since being in Israel) because I know how much we need it, and all the incredible things that are provided by the drops that fall from the sky.  So the clouds are really very important, because they are the carriers of the nourishing rain that the world needs so badly in order to grow.  It made me think about the clouds in our lives.  We often see clouds, or challenges, rolling into our lives and we get fearful and stressed out.  These clouds bring the rain, or pain, into our lives.  We go through the storm, it may be hard, it may cause some damage, we may need to seek shelter to get through it.  But on the other side of the storm, when the clouds part, and the sun shines through again, we have been given nourishment and what we need to grow.  And braving the storm, taking in the water, enables us to sprout and in turn beautify and fulfill what we are here to do.  In the middle of the storm, it is difficult to see the beauty of what will eventually be the outcome.  But if we make the most of every drop of rain we are given, and if we appreciate the clouds that roll through our lives as lessons and growth material, we can actualize the potential of the storms we are given.

      I was in line in a store this morning on my way to work, running a bit late.  An elderly black man in front of me turned around and offered me his place in line.  He told me that he was not heading to work so he wasn't in a hurry like everyone else.  As I waited on my order, I watched him do the same thing for several other customers.  It wasn't such a big thing to do, but it really showed so much thoughtfulness.  Instead of worrying about getting ahead or getting through a few minutes quicker, this man was more concerned about easing someone else's daily stress.  I think these small acts, if everyone put effort into making them part of their daily routine, would go such an incredibly long way in fostering love and unity throughout communities.  I thanked the man several times for letting me in front of him, but more than saving me a few minutes of time, I really appreciate the kindness and thoughtfulness he showed his fellow human being.  He inspired me!

      In general, I try to focus on the positive, to hope for the best, and to give the benefit of the doubt.  I sometimes wonder, though, how far that should be taken.  Does it make sense to always believe in the good even if it means that often you will be disappointed?  Does it help to hold onto hope in the face of evidence that leads one to believe that maybe it just isn't practical?  What is the proper place between being naive and being cynical - is there such a thing as being realistic and if so, how do you find that balance?  I always try to encourage others to look for the best of situations, to consider alternate reasons for seemingly bad attitudes, and I try to embrace this outlook myself.  But often, I find myself being berated by others for being naive or blind to the way the world works.  Many people I have encountered have a seemingly bleak view of life, though as someone pointed out to me, even though they speak of the dark side, they rarely act on it.  Most people do act as if they care about others, even if they will say that they are out for only themselves.  So, which do you do - always expect the worst and be pleasantly surprised when things turn out better than you were planning, or expect the best and sometimes get disappointed?  And is there a possible balance between the two?  As much as I have been disappointed, I am unwilling and incapable of getting rid of my optimism, my belief in the fact that people really do care about others, just because they are fellow human beings.  I believe, as Aristotle says, that we are inherently social beings who need each other to survive.  And in needing each other, I think we would prefer to look for the good, and focus on the positive.  Maybe I do get disappointed on occasion, but I feel that my overall outlook leaves me better off on a daily basis.  And I would rather suffer the let-downs rather than have a negative view of the world.  I hope that no matter what life throws me, I am able to maintain my optimism, even if it means that I don't get my scales tipped over once in a while.

      I spent this past weekend in Buffalo, where my extended family resides.  We celebrated my great-aunt and uncle's 50th Wedding Anniversary.  The last time I had been to Buffalo was eight years ago, and I hadn't seen some members of my family since that time.  Moving around a lot growing up, and having moved away from my immediate family some years ago has left me distanced from most of my family members, both physically and emotionally.  We were watching movies of when my mom grew up, just blocks away from her cousins, aunts and uncles, and I felt a bit of sadness that I don't have that closeness, that I never had the opportunity to get to know my relatives so well.  I think family is largely what you make it, and I am very lucky to have made a family of friends, but is not quite the same as blood relation.  It was hard seeing that some of my cousins, who are my grandparent's great-nieces and nephews, were much closer to my grandparents than I am, mainly because of the geography factor.  I was very happy I was able to attend the celebration.  It wasn't easy, as kosher food and Shabbos are not regular parts of my family's lives.  But I made do, and I think my family was happy that I was able to take part, even in a limited way.  I feel, in a small way, I was a kiddush Hashem for showing my family that even though I live this stringent lifestyle that is so different from theirs, that even though I couldn't eat the food they were eating, I could still be a part of the family, and participate in my own way.  I hope that the next time I see my family is not another eight years away.

      I have been feeling antsy for the past week or so.  Have had that feeling that it is time to move on, do something new, get out of Baltimore, possibly for good.  I have had trouble concentrating, I keep starting different books but can't get into any of them.  I have just had a very unsettled feel.  Last night, I was trying to explore this feeling a bit more and I think I figured out what it is - I think I miss school!  I am enjoying being on break very much, and I like not having the pressure of 100 pages to read in a few days, but I feel like I have lost my focus, and I think that is something that school really gives me.  It is nice to have time off, but I have gotten so used to deadlines, and assignments, and having something that I should be doing hanging over me all the time; that I am finding it difficult to not have those clearly defined goals laid out for me.  By the end of the summer semester I was hoping that five weeks off would be enough for me to relax and be ready to go back to school.  I wasn't sure it would be enough of a break.   And like I said, I am enjoying my time off, but I have just had that vague sense that something is missing.  Apparently, it is deadlines and stress and pressure.  Who wants life to be boring?

      I spent this past weekend in Boro Park, which for me is quite a monumental event, considering that I had never before set foot in Brooklyn. I spent the weekend meeting new people, seeing new sights and having new experiences. All of this was wonderful and interesting, though I have to admit I am exhausted.  I think I still have a lot to absorb and reflect on, but what I found interesting was something my friend said to me right before I left. He made a comment about how different my Shabbos must have been, because the people I had interacted with were so different from those I typically spend time with.  The truth was, that was the thing that I thought the littlest about. I  saw  a lot of different sights and modes of dress in those I met in Boro Park. But everyone I sat down to talk to  acted  very similar to those I already know. Yes, they had some different views and many different experiences from those I was accustomed to hearing, but at the core, they were people, and they were the same as everyone else.  I have to say, it was a comforting feeling. In preparation for my trip, I was concerned that I would feel completely out of place and like a visitor of a foreign country. Or like a rare specimen that no one had ever seen before - some weird girl from the strange state of Alabama who has never before seen Brooklyn. And I felt it in a very small way, in the fact that the dress and accents were different from what I usually experience. Several people I met were surprised by the fact that I had never before been to Boro Park. But the way I interacted with everyone and how they seemed to react to me was with very little variation from my typical day to day experiences in Baltimore.  I guess what I am saying is, at heart, it doesn't matter where you grow up - Boro Park, Baltimore or Birmingham. People are people and if you can see beyond external appearances, then you can feel comfortable anywhere.

      I sometimes feel like I am becoming jaded, losing my rose-colored vision, and I am not sure whether it is a good thing or a bad thing.  The things that used to inspire me don't always do it anymore. I just read an article about the beauty of the Orthodox world, how it makes everything so meaningful and beautiful, and my first reaction was to think that the author was really naive.  That bothers me so much, not that the author describes Orthodoxy as meaningful, because I find that to be true, but that I had such a negative reaction to what I was reading. A few years ago, when I was first starting to become religious, I believed it all. I believed that wearing long-sleeved shirts in the middle of 100-degree whether showed dignity. I believed that Orthodox families were more well-behaved, loving and supportive of its members than the outside world. Maybe I have seen too much of the dark, hurtful side that is out there, but I am finding it hard to believe any more.  Now, I know that all of the dark things that are in the Orthodox world are in the secular world also, and in an even greater measure. I have, in a lot of ways, cut myself off from that outside world that didn't make me happy to begin with. In fact, it really made me unhappy for a long time. I don't desire to be part of that world again, because I found it to be devoid of meaning and purpose. But I am worried that I don't find what I have chosen as inspirational and uplifting as I once did.  I know you need balance in life, and you can't stay on a high forever. Maybe this feeling is normal. Maybe I am not jaded, just a bit more realistic than I used to be. I still feel that what I have chosen for my life is the right path, and I can't imagine going back, don't want to even think about going back. But sometimes I wish I had those rose-colored glasses again.  Have a good Shabbos!

      I just read  urlLink this article  from  urlLink Aish.com  about Happiness. Go on, click on the link and read the article, it really is a beautiful, inspiring piece.  After reading articles like that, I usually feel two things - awe and thankfulness.  I am in such awe of those who struggle with so much and manage to keep a positive perspective on life. I see so many people who have so many challenges thrown their way, yet they always thank Hashem for the many blessings they have. I think a lot of people would be better off if they were able to keep such an uplifting perspective, I see many who complain (loudly) about dealing with a lot less than those mentioned in the article. But I understand that everyone has their own challenges to face and a good attitude does not come naturally to everyone. But I sure admire those who work so hard to keep their focus positive.  The other thing I always feel is thankfulness. I have had challenges in my life, just like everyone. Some of them have been hard, but I really feel like I have not had to deal with anything so devastating that would cause a person to break. And I am so thankful for that. I know that Hashem gives me the strength and resources to deal with whatever I am thrown, but I am almost embarrassed to admit that I am glad that He decided not to give me (until this point, anyway) whatever it takes to overcome the incredible obstacles in life. So I am definitely thankful for everything I have been given and not given.  I was inspired reading the article above, I hope you are also.

      I was really bored at work today, so I decided to change my template to something other than blue.  I like blue a lot, and I am not promising that it won't show up again at some point, but for now, I decided I needed a change of pace and different colors for my blog.  Unfortunately, I couldn't manage to get my former commenting system to work on this new template.  The old comments are stored somewhere, just not where anyone can get to them at this point.  Not sure why I couldn't get it to work, not being a computer person, I am the wrong person to figure it out.  So anyway, leave me new comments!  With new colors comes well, not much of anything else new.  But stay tuned, and maybe there will be more changes in the future.

      I have a memory from when I was about 4 years old. I was in pre-school and it was raining out during the time we were supposed to play on the playground. My best friend and I were skipping around the playground, arm in arm, singing "Singing in the Rain" at the top of our lungs. We didn't care about the fact that it was raining out, and we were getting wet - we were enjoying singing and each other, and just being alive. The way that is so easy for a 4-year-old.  I have a ritual of leaving my office for half and hour each day during my lunch break so that I can get some air and get away from my desk and responsibilities for a little while. Most of the time I walk across the street to the Inner Harbor and sit by the water and read or just relax. Sometimes someone will stop and talk to me, but most of the time I just spend the time looking at the water and enjoying the air. Sometimes, I will have a couple errands to run, so I will walk a few blocks behind my office to a store and pick up whatever I need. It doesn't really matter so much to me what I do, just that I get out of my office.  Today, at my usual lunch time, it was raining. I was really not thrilled by the idea of staying inside my office, so I decided to grab my umbrella and walk to the drugstore anyway. I walked down the streets, watched people scramble for cover and just focused on enjoying being outside. Who cares that it was raining? I didn't sing, because that is much more fun to do when you have a friend to sing with, but it reminded me of that time long ago when I skipped around the playground.  I got to the drugstore only a little bit wet (though I did manage to ruin my sandals forever). It was worth it to be wet for the reminder of what it was like to be a kid - carefree and enjoying life.

      I like driving. It gives me a chance to have quiet thinking time. I am not sure why I am unable to have quiet thinking time in my apartment, but I really like getting out on the road and driving off to some unknown destination, wherever my car leads me.  So yesterday I was having a stressful morning, and by the time my inner klutz took over and I gave myself a nice injury, I decided it was time to get out of my apartment to take a drive and clear my head.  I knew that Pennsylvania is directly north of Maryland, and that I could get there without too much complication, so I decided to head towards Amish country.  The only other time I have been to Pennsylvania was one motzei Shabbos when a friend had a wedding in Gettysburg and I didn't want her to drive there by herself so late, so I went with her.  But going at night, I really missed a lot.  Driving up into Pennsylvania, the building get scarce and the hills and trees and water become more common.  It has been raining on and off for the last few days, so everything was bright green and fresh looking.  I found a spot next to a lake to pull off and I sat on the crisp grass, and watched a boy fishing with his family.  I took off my shoes and walked through the grass and even got a little bit of mud on my feet.  It was so nice, it made me feel like I was in the middle of the country (well, I kind of was).  It was refreshing to get out of the city for a few hours and sit by the water, with the knowledge that no one knew where I was.  Even though it was only for a little while, it was a real getaway, where my issues couldn't reach.  I was only gone for a total of 3 or 4 hours, but it was enough to recharge my batteries.  Sometimes all you need is some grass and water and trees.

      Today this blog is one year old. I am always amazed when I look back a year and see how quickly it has gone and (hopefully) how much has been accomplished. I feel like my life has really changed in this past year. I started school, I've made new friends, I've changed my life plans about 564 times (and they are still up in the air), and I like to think that I have become a more well-rounded, confident, knowledgeable person.  I started this blog specifically as a place for me to get my thoughts out, not really expecting anyone else to ever read it. It has evolved over the year into a place where I share with others my opinions, hone and improve my writing, and get my thoughts out. Through this blog, I have met other bloggers, made some friends, possibly some enemies, and even encouraged someone else to start their own blog.  I have comments now, and actually have commenters on occasion. I have discovered that I really enjoy writing, really love having the outlet to express my thoughts, and I have fun with the challenge of forcing myself to pin down how I feel about the topics I write about.  What I think I like best about having my blog is that I feel connected to others through it. It is a special community of those who write and read blogs. I have heard from people who I would never have connected with otherwise, and found that there are people out there who share my thoughts on many topics.  So here's to a great first year, and hopefully more to come!
