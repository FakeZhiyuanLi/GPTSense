      Today Jerry got dumped. I told him i thought he would last a week...he lasted a day. How sad. :-(  He and Hong came over and we played my old N64 for about 4 hours...it took his mind off being dumped. Video games are the Cure!  Now Jordans gone for a week with Jessica...Im gonna miss you Jordan! Shes so awesome...its gonna suck that shes gone. I miss her!

      That was awesome. Me and Jeremiah rode down to sunset and saw Anchorman...it was so funny. Jerry almost shit his pants.   We had 2 hours to kill before the movie started so we went to the dollar store. It was just about to close, since it was 9pm. We were talking about Jordan, and on our way out, saw some glass flowers. We decided to get a couple for her. Then we thought we needed a card too, so we ran over to K-mart and bought one. Then we saw the movie...which was hillarious. After that Jerry called his mom and she picked us up...( we were to lazy to ride ) When we got back to Jerry's house it was like 1 in the morning so we "went to sleep". When we knew his parents were asleep, we snuck out the back and walked down to Jordans house. It was about 2 when we got there. Then we put the flowers and card on the porch. We walked back to his house and got there at 2:30. Then we watched tv for a bit and went to sleep sometime before 4am.   We got up at like 10 and cleaned up Jerrys room for an hour. Then while i was messin around on his base, the sneeky bastard got on AIM and asked Jordan out! Right away he yells for me to get down there, and i read the chat....she said yes!  We spent the rest of the day tryin to meet up with Jordan, and finally got to at 5:20 for like 5 mins.  Wow...Jerry is so lucky. He beat me to it.

      Wow, this is sooo much fun.  1st day - My aunt picks me up from the airport and we dont do anything special that day except relax.  2nd day - We spend the whole day watching movies on pay-per-view and tv. Just more relaxing.  3rd day - Total mystery to me and my sister...my Aunt wont tell me where we are going. She wakes us up at 6am to get ready, and we are outta the house by 7am. Then we drive for 4 hours to "hearst castle". Its some castle type thingy that this really rich guy built, now its a historical landmark or something. After going on the tour of the castle, we went to our hotel and i swam in the pool with my sister for like 5 hours.  4th day - Another long drive. Again my aunt wont tell us where we are going. It was supposed to be a 2 hour drive but there was a lot of people that drove really really slow and we couldn't pass them so it was more like 3 hours. We finally got to our hotel...called the Econo-Lodge...wow, that sounds classy. We then drove for like 15 mins to a place called "mystery spot" where anything round rolls uphill, and you can walk up walls and stuff...im gonna have my aunt get her pics on a CD so i can post some here. Then we drive back to our hotel and i swim with my sister again, only for 3 hours this time.  5th day - Did i mention that we were in Sana Cruz? Haha. Beach! Santa Cruz Boardwalk, that was fun. A few good rides, foood, girls...haha. And the beach...that was cool, except i have sand all over me because theres so much sand in the water...and because i got buried. Haha, that was fun. Now for the drive back to my Aunts house. It should have been like an hour drive, but my uncle got lost for a few mins, then there was a wreck somehwhere, and that made a lot of traffic. Finally 2 hours later we get back to my Aunt's house. I watch a lil tv then crash at about midnight.  6th day - Today my Aunt had to go to a friends sisters funeral. I get to stay at her house and just eat ice cream all day and watch more tv. Nothin special.  7th day - Today was the last day... :( . We went to a place called Boomers...they have go karts, batting cages, mini golf, arcade, that type of stuff. It was fun. I hate the words 'i dunno' right now. You will be shot if u say that more than 2 times in a day to me. :-) Unless ur name is Jordan then you can say it all u want.  8th day - I flew back home...and we got Krsipy Creme donuts...it was awesome! But when we were boarding, the dude takin the ticket things asked how old me and my sister were...i said 14, and my sis said 12. Then the guy is like she has to be 13 to fly unless there is someone 18 years old with her. WTF! My Aunt had to pay 30$ so this lady that worked for the airport and was going to seattle anyway could walk my sis on and off the plane...it was so fucked up....it never happened any other time i've taken a cousin or sibling along that was under 13. Stupid airport.

      Haha, that was fun at the movies. Jerry bought Katie a glass flower and he was to scared to give it to her...he sat on it and it stabbed him in the ass when it broke, and then clanged to the floor..it was so fucking funny because me and him were joking that it might happen.  Jerry was holding my step moms cell, and i forgot to get it back from him...so i had to ride up to his house...which is all up hill. And i had to mow the lawn...my step mom wont leave me alone...and i have to get a haircut too...i get no time to relax today.  OOO! OMG! Shes back! I missed her soo much! Yay! Jordan is back! Hooray!
