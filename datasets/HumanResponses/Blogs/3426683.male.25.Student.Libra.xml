      I have a pet peeve about athletes writing columns for news sources.  From Cris Carter, Jack McDowell, and Steve Kerr over at Yahoo! Sports to Frank Robinson and John Kruk at ESPN.com, I'm fairly annoyed by the whole bunch of them.  I suppose I'm off the mark in wanting better, more interesting articles, instead of platitude and cliché-ridden fluff pieces.  Most of the time, I can ignore them and go about my daily life.  Occasionally, something strikes me as ridiculously funny.  John Kruk's new article, which you can find  urlLink here , talks about the slowest runners in the majors right now.  Of course, over 10 years in the pros, Kruk stole 58 bases and was caught 31 times (career stats  urlLink here ).  This gives him almost identical career stats to that other famous base-stealer,  urlLink James Edward Rice .  The difference being that Baseball-Reference.com compares Rice favorably to such Hall of Famers as Duke Snider, Orlando Cepeda, Willie Mays (this one surprised me, but I guess from a power standpoint it's not that far off), Billie Williams, and Willie Stargell.  Kruk, on the other hand, compares favorably with Rusty Greer, Mike Easler, Troy O'Leary, Darrin Erstad, and Hal McRae.  I guess you write what you know.   Update : To be fair, Kruk's dead on about Malone laying out Darrick Martin.  Just as Dr. Z was right about Sapp's hit on Clifton a couple years ago.  Not quite the same thing, but I'm still pretty annoyed about that last one, okay?

      A smattering of sports columns on teams west of the Mississippi...  Ralph Wiley has a brilliant  urlLink article  over at ESPN's Page 2 breaking down the Lakers.  My favorite part:  "As for Shaq, this is the biggest part of the myth, literally and figuratively. It's like all Shaq has to do is stomp his foot, and the world trembles. I actually thought Doug Collins would soil himself the other night when Gary Trent had the temerity, the gall, to tap Shaq on the shoulder and move him off Mark Madsen.   'Don't pull on Superman's cape!' Collins begged. OK, when Superman shows up in the NBA, I'll remember that. In the meantime, play on, m&@&#$%@!"  Also over at ESPN.com, see John Clayton's piece on the  urlLink AFC West .

      Good old Vladimir (beware the Freudian quack).  But then, again, who cares if Nabokov doesn't want us to read his works through a psychoanalytic lens?  It's not really his call.    On a more serious note, an interesting discussion about authorial intention has popped up  urlLink here .  My points basically boil down to this (see the comments for them in their original glory):  1.  Reconstructing an author's intentions is no different or more valid than any other reading, particularly if we're going to allow in history and biography, which are immediately interpretive works themselves (I'm separating autobiography out here, which although it's unreliable, it's at least written by the author).  2.  If an author contradicts himself, we're in trouble.  Particularly if he doesn't change the text but then changes his reading of the same work.

      I am, I should mention, a former graduate student in English at the University of North Carolina.  By now, between my financial situation and a general frustration with the whole academic apparatus, I think I may have laid waste to all the bridges back to that world that I may have had.    Within the next few months, I'll be moving back to Boston, and, although I don't think I'd really want to go back to UNC or grad school if I could (see  urlLink here  for some reasons, particularly or specifically -- your choice -- the point about Dickens and Collins), it's really odd to have absolutely no net there.   As for the Dickens/Collins thing (and I  really  like Collins' short work), it's a bit bogus that the field feels that nearly everything that can be said about the aesthetics of Dickens or Melville has been said.  I didn't go to grad school to work on second tier authors (*cough*Harriet Martineau*cough*) just because no one else was working on them or to get a job at an R1.  And, for me, although this could just be me and only me, cultural studies promotes that sort of work.  It levels the playing field and creates a world where the works of Martineau or even people more famous like Collins or Elizabeth Barrett Browning are as valuable as the works of Ruskin, Dickens, Austen, or Brontë.  Dogs and cats living together, anyone?   Addendum : I should say that I like EBB, too, but she's just not on the same level as her husband or Tennyson.  That'd be like comparing, oh, say, Jim Rice and Mike Greenwell.  Gator was a great LF, but Rice was one of the best hitters in the game between 1975 and 1986.  And, yes, unrelated to my problems with graduate school, Rice should be in the Hall of Fame.

      According to  urlLink this column  by Ken Rosenthal, the Red Sox have expressed interest in erstwhile Pirates OF Raul Mondesi:  "Mondesi, who likely won't play before the appeal of his legal dispute in the Dominican Republic, scheduled for June 16, told a reporter in the Dominican that he has attracted interest from the Angels, Red Sox, Mariners and Cardinals. . . ."  This, to me, at least makes sense, and it might betray a little bit of uncertainty by Red Sox brass regarding Trot Nixon's back (of course, the same could be said about the Angels and how they feel about Vladimir Guerrero's back).  If the Sox could sign him, he's an upgrade over just about every back-up OF (don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Kapler, Millar, and Daubach, but defensively?) they have, and if Nixon goes down for the longterm, his defense is more than adequate.  Plus, batting him sixth or seventh in the Sox lineup, either behind or between Ortiz and Varitek, assuming that Nomar returns to the 4th spot and Manny heads to the 3rd, as the Sox intended during spring training)  could do wonders for his offensive production.

      I'm not a huge  Star Wars  fan anymore.  Episode I (which I walked out of) took care of that.  At any rate,  urlLink this article  pretty much gets at a lot of the problems:  "Fire Hayden Christensen, whose single emotive capacity is sullen petulance, and whose attempts to put on the magisterial rage that must become Darth Vader’s hallmark instead sound like a tenth-grader whose dad won’t let him borrow the car. This is essentially the story of a guy who becomes Space Hitler, which is already hard enough to get people to take seriously without casting a scowly teen.  While you’re at it get rid of Natalie Portman, who as Queen Amidala has all the regal presence of a mallrat shopping at her local Fashion Bug. Keep Samuel Jackson, Frank Oz, Anthony Daniels, and Ian McDiarmid, and thank your lucky stars that you’ve got Christopher Lee, who’s been showcasing his considerable talent in Z-grade horror flicks for decades and knows better than perhaps any living actor how to pull a terrific performance out of truly awful material. Tell Ewan Macgregor, who’s proven elsewhere he’s a fine actor, that it’s safe to come out and emote now. Fire everyone else."  "Space Hitler" is a gloriously inappropriate comparison, but Bahn has a point.  Darth Vader's one bad man; Hayden Christensen is not.

      Interesting  urlLink article  over at Slate on Garfield and Jim Davis.  Particularly thought this was interesting: "Davis's genius is that he's created the most widely syndicated comic strip in history—with the attendant profusion of plush toys, T-shirts, and themed Caribbean cruises—and yet, through careful brand management, he's largely managed to deflate the naturally occurring cultural counterattack."  I'm not sure we should be praising this behavior (although it's pretty damn smart).

      This is the centennial of Bloomsday.  Which means that the following post, originally submitted to  urlLink Nabokv-L , a mailing list about Vladimir Nabokov (see original message  urlLink here ), is somewhat on-topic today:  "I'm sorry to bring too much of Joyce to this list, but this is so good I simply can't help it. Dale Peck talking about Nabokov's later works or about Ulysses (by the way, next Wednesday is the centenary of the Bloomsday) is pretty boringly courteous if compared with this kind of criticism on Amazon.com:   'Joyce is blind in one eye because he read Ulysses and then the eye hung itself,' writes Ben Kharakh. 'I'm contemplating traveling back in time and murdering James Joyce, in the face...For Ulysses to be any worse of a book, it would have to break into your house and defecate on your bed.'"  Happy Bloomsday!   Update : I have been contacted by the author of the amazon.com review and asked to correct my attribution of the review.  Done!

      We were listening to  urlLink Reluctant Beating, Inc. 's  Family Planning  today at work, and it's an enjoyable little disc, so I thought I'd pimp it here.  I suggest checking out "Jeremy and the Bobcat," "Mindreader," and "Evan Eschmeyer (DNP)."  Neat and fun stuff, kind of reminiscent of They Might Be Giants.  Also, on the local music tip, if you haven't heard the  urlLink Two Dollar Pistols , you really ought to check them out.  John Howie's voice is awesome, and the band's wicked tight.  My personal recommendation is  You Ruined Everything , but their newest album is sweet, too.

      There are a number of fun little articles in the  urlLink Boston Globe  on our country's presidents:    urlLink Comparing Dutch and Dubya: The leader and the led  -- my favorite quote:  "Reagan got advice from wife Nancy, who consulted astrologer to stars, Joan Quigley. Bush went to war on advice of Vice President Cheney who consulted con man to neocons, Ahmed Chalabi. Not clear whether Quigley or Chalabi had better fix on reality."    urlLink Bush presidencies: two men, two roads  -- some food for thought:  "'Bush One was a reluctant but major architect of the successful effort to balance the budget, eliminate deficits, and create surpluses,' said Robert Reischauer, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office who worked closely on the 1990 budget deal under the senior Bush. 'Bush Two has taken surpluses and transformed them into large and persistent deficits that represent a more serious threat to our economy than did the deficits faced by his father.'  "The deficit hit a peak of $341 billion in 1992 under the senior Bush, was replaced by surpluses during the Clinton administration, but soared back to $353 billion in 2003 under the junior Bush, said Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Those figures are adjusted for inflation, providing what economists consider to be the fairest comparison. In actual dollars, the comparison is even more stark: The deficit reached a peak of $269 billion under the senior Bush and a peak of $521 billion under his son, Reischauer said."    urlLink Nine traits that predict great presidents  -- this includes: "Tender-mindedness, that is, concern for the less fortunate, predicts both presidential success and ethical behavior on the job. FDR and Lincoln scored high on this trait, while James Buchanan and Nixon scored low."

      So I go to the local  urlLink B-Dubs  to get some food and watch the Dodgers play the Sox.  Petey's pitching, so I'm pretty stoked.  I order my meal, get a beer, sit down and watch.  I'm a little late, and the Dodgers have already scored a run, but only one, so it's okay.  Unfortunately, I can't listen to the play-by-play, because the WWE's  urlLink Bad Blood  pay-per-view is on almost every single TV with the volume jacked up, including the TV immediately to the right of the baseball game.  This is okay.  I can handle this.  I can block out the WWE and watch the ballgame.  I manage to ignore the  urlLink four-way bout for the women's world championship , despite the locals hooting and hollering around me (for some reason, I'm vaguely reminded of Braves OF Andruw Jones's  urlLink testimony  during the Gold Club trial and his reference to the strippers "doing lesbian action").  No worries.  I'm okay.  This is what I have to deal with to watch the ballgame.  Fine.  We'll just tune that out and pay attention to the ballgame.    By this point, I have an internal monologue doing play-by-play for the ballgame, trying to keep myself focused, but it's getting interrupted by the yahoo in front of me howling with laughter during the match between  urlLink Eugene and Jonathan Coachman .  By now, my monologue's sounding like this: "Okay, here's the one-one BODY SLAM!!!! that's a strike on the outside YAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA and a routine grounder to THE PEOPLE'S ELBOW!!!!..."  Also, by now, the NBA finals are getting going, and I've got to contend with Tom Tolbert's mug on the TV to the left of the ballgame.  I ended up right before the bottom of the fourth, which most of the people in B-Dubs would have considered to be right before  urlLink Kane and Chris Benoit  squared off.  I half expected someone to turn and ask me where I was going, as I was going to miss "the best part."  Anyhow, there's no punchline to this.  Just had to share my pain.

      I rented  urlLink Eurotrip  tonight.  It was a bit better than I expected, but that doesn't really say much.  I rented it mostly because I was bored, and the video store didn't have a terrific selection (also rented  urlLink School of Rock  and the international edition of  urlLink Trainspotting , which I've unbelievably never seen -- as to why I didn't watch those first, well, I don't know).    The main characters were barely likable, or, in the case of  urlLink Jacob Pitts's  character, completely unlikable.  Pitts resembles David Spade in the film, both in appearance and mannerisms, but has none of Spade's wit or polish.  The other cast members are passable, but there's nothing special here.  I wasn't even sure that they were having fun (which was most of the appeal of  urlLink American Pie 2  and  urlLink American Wedding , which I enjoyed a bit).    To be fair, the script by Alec Berg & David Mandel doesn't give any of the actors much to work with, pushing the characters through fairly conventional situations with familiar punchlines, all of which seemed to have been done better before.  For instance,  urlLink Tomcats  does the Surprise Dominatrix scene far better (now, of course, we've established that I've seen and remember  Tomcats  -- in my defense, it was on cable, I couldn't sleep, and my only other option was  urlLink Bordello of Blood , which I had seen the night before -- I don't want to talk about that).  Overall, it's a bad movie.  A really bad movie.  But it has two moments that I felt made it worth the price of rental:   Matt Damon in a cameo as the front man for a rock band, with a shaved head, tattoos, and a dog collar.  Made me do a double take.  Unlike most of the cast, Damon seems to have fun in his brief cameo.  A ridiculous slapstick sequence in the Vatican, which although predictable, flows well and the visual payoff of  urlLink Mechlowicz  in the Papal garb is uproarious.

      Finished  Absolutely American  the other day (Sunday to be precise).  Brilliant read and remarkably apolitical for a book on West Point.  Reading it, it's hard to remember that so many of these kids are  so  young.  I admire the people that can choose to do that willingly.  It's a job that someone needs to fill, preferably not me (I don't think I'm built that way).  At the same time, I can't help but think that some of the more huah guys (career infantry) must feel like they're in an alien world when they leave or are discharged.  For instance, "Good dog -- defecating beyond the perimeter" is wicked funny, but kind of bothersome, too.  In any case, recommended reading certainly.  I also finished  Shrub  by Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose.  I know I'm a little late on the curve there, but I wanted to read it for a while and just got a chance.  Interesting stuff in there about W's time in Texas.  Currently, I'm reading Jack Vance's  The Dying Earth  and  Bushwacked , the sequel to  Shrub .  Haven't read enough of either to really get an impression yet, but the latter seems like a surer bet.  Vance's novel, on the other hand, which was written in 1950, is pulp fantasy and dated, although it has its moments certainly.  I'm just not sure about it quite yet.

      These are the types of people we have running our country.  Do you think we should tell them that international law very much applies to the president and his war here?  I mean, isn't that what  international  law is for?  (Original article  urlLink here .)    "President Bush (news - web sites), as commander-in-chief, is not restricted by U.S. and international laws barring torture, Bush administration lawyers stated in a March 2003 memorandum.      "The 56-page memo to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld cited the president's 'complete authority over the conduct of war,' overriding international treaties such as a global treaty banning torture, the Geneva Conventions and a U.S. federal law against torture.   "'In order to respect the president's inherent constitutional authority to manage a military campaign ... (the prohibition against torture) must be construed as inapplicable to interrogations undertaken pursuant to his commander-in-chief authority,'" stated the memo, obtained by Reuters on Tuesday."

      So I'm reading  Absolutely American  by David Lipsky, the summer reading for the University of North Carolina.  Good, well-written, interesting stuff.  I was wondering as I read it if the idea of the gentleman soldier is really all that dead.  At least in Vietnam (yes, I know there was a draft), most of the grunts came from lower-class families and, if I recall correctly, officers were career military men, West Pointers, etc.  Although the book doesn't really get at it (at least not yet), it seems to me that in order to have the opportunity to attend the USMA, you really need to have a pretty good home life and standard of living.  The application process is ridiculously complex.  Not a complaint, just a thought and comment.  I could, of course, be very wrong.  In other news, this had me chuckling: "'So my middle name is O'Keeffe,' Southerland explains, 'After the painter, Georgia O'Keeffe.  I use here paintings as computer wallpaper, always have.   From the Plains, The Larence Tree, From the Faraway Nearby. '  It's probably the last thing Georgia O'Keeffe even expected, to have a measured career assessment delivered from a set of BDUs.  'Her early collection, all the cityscapes and everything -- the more industrial, mechanical sort of canvases -- they get a little lost in the shuffle.  But they're beautiful.'"   Huah.

       urlLink George Tenet stepped down  from his post as Director of the CIA yesterday.  This in itself has been expected, as noted in most commentary I've read (links here are to the  Boston Globe  mostly because it's my newspaper of choice), and Tenet doesn't seem to have been particularly competent (whether or not the administration allowed him to do his job).  What disturbs me is the following item from  urlLink this article :  "Tenet tacitly accepted the Defense Department's decision to create a new intelligence branch, the Office of Special Plans, after neoconservatives -- particularly Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz and Undersecretary Douglas J. Feith -- insisted that the CIA was not properly assessing the dangers posed by Hussein.  "The existence of the new office, which reportedly collected information from exiles, including Chalabi, infuriated many analysts in the CIA who had monitored Iraq for decades. But after the war, when members of Congress began demanding answers for the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, White House leaders pointed to the CIA, not the Defense Department."  Aside from reading like a classic end-around, this would seem to reinforce the article's points that politics played a big role in some of the events that have taken place involving the CIA.  I love the whole bit about the CIA "not properly assesing the dangers posed by Hussein," which reads suspiciously similarly to "not telling the Bush administration what it wants to hear."  That, of course, seems to be par for the course right now.  Besides, is it me, or does the name  Office of Special Plans  sound really sinister?

      See  urlLink here .  I'm officially stoked.  I just watched  Bowling for Columbine  (finally) and was completely knocked out by it.  It's one of the best films I've seen in a while (and that includes  Mystic River , which I loved).  As a side note, I find it laughable that some  urlLink people  are complaining that Moore's film presents only his point of view.  Ebert's response to this is spot on: "Well of course it's a politically motivated film. That's allowed. President Bush's speeches are politically motivated, and he doesn't give lip service to views opposite his own. That's allowed, too."

      For me, the main thing that went wrong with this film was what parts of the story they chose to tell and how they chose to tell it.&nbsp;   The knights.  The knights are from Sarmatia, except Arthur, who's from Sarmatia via Rome, and likely has never lived in Sarmatia.&nbsp; This isn't traditional Arthurian stuff, and the presence of French names (Lancelot,&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagonet) strains it.&nbsp; It's hard to believe that Lancelot, who's almost wholly the creation of the French romances, is a wild and wooly Eastern European horseman that fights with two swords.&nbsp; Also, Sarmatia really only functions to make the plot work -- it's far enough away that the knights need their papers to get home safely.&nbsp; Finally, we have no real idea of what the knights are like beyond broad strokes of personality -- Bors drinks too much and has eleven children with a Briton, Tristan's got a pet hawk and is a dead shot with a bow, Galahad's tired of fighting, Lancelot doesn't understand Arthur's religion, Dagonet and Gawain have no noticeable personality.&nbsp; There are too many characters for the movie to support.&nbsp; Even Arthur only gets the most basic of personalities.&nbsp; None of them really got enough screen time for me to give a damn about them or their fates.&nbsp; Also, it suffers from the same problem  The   Thin Red Line  had for me -- too many&nbsp;actors looked vaguely alike (I had to piece together Tristan's death by who was still alive and what they were fighting with).&nbsp; Finally, Dagonet, if I recall my Arthurian myths correctly, was Arthur's fool, not a knight.&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize this last point&nbsp;is overly technical, but why choose Dagonet and not Percival, Kay, or Bedivere, or another major knight such as...   Mordred .&nbsp; The entire Mordred story line was cut out.&nbsp; Gone.&nbsp; If I recall my Arthurian literature class from undergrad correctly, the unravelling of civilization, the destruction of the Round Table, and circumstances of Arthur's death (Mallory's work&nbsp;is, after all,  Le Morte d'Arthur ) are kind of the point of the story and myths.&nbsp; It's not to say you couldn't tell another story, and I don't dislike the idea of this one, but you get no sense of there being an end to it.&nbsp; Which leads me to the other thing that's not present in the story (and the movie I think most people want to see):   The Love Triangle.  When most people think of Arthur, I'm going to guess that the Guinevere-Lancelot thing comes to mind first.&nbsp; It could be the fault of Lerner & Loewe or Mallory or both, but this is present in every Arthur story from the French Romances on up.&nbsp; And it is the story, in my opinion, not "Arthur and his knights do really good deeds and sometimes free the Britons" -- it runs through everything in Mallory and comes up repeatedly in both Chrétien de Troyes and Tennyson.&nbsp; With the Mordred storyline, it's the major precipitating event of the end of times in the myth; both represent the dissolution of the bonds that hold society together.&nbsp; Mordred's the product of incest and Lancelot&nbsp;is breaking&nbsp;his feudal vows by sleeping with Guinevere -- and that vow is what holds this society together.&nbsp; It's a bang-up story, and one worth telling, but it's not here.&nbsp; Instead, we get a few significant glances between Lancelot and Guinevere and then he dies fighting to save her.&nbsp; Not quite the same thing.&nbsp;   I did during the course of the movie think that the movie might be espousing some mild right-wing propoganda, but nothing solid enough to write about (and it probably was just me being paranoid).&nbsp; Was the film worth seeing?&nbsp; Probably worth renting.&nbsp; It was nothing too thrilling in the theaters.&nbsp; I had the distinct feeling that, despite the mediocre reviews its received, I should have seen  I, Robot  instead of  King Arthur .&nbsp; Of course, I probably should have saved the pass I used to see it until later in the summer, but that's neither here nor there.

      I've just returned from seeing the Bruckheimer/Fuqua extravaganza  King Arthur .&nbsp; To be completely honest, I don't think this is the Arthur movie people want to see.&nbsp; I'm not sure that  Excalibur  is, but I haven't seen that yet, and I'm pretty sure that Disney's  The Sword in the Stone , although cute, isn't&nbsp;the right one either&nbsp;-- although TH White is probably closer to right than wrong.&nbsp; I've also managed to miss  First Knight  with Gere/Ormond/Connery, so I'll have to reserve judgement on that one, too.  What the film got right, as far as I'm concerned, comes down to setting and sets.&nbsp; I liked the sets, liked the scenes at the Roman villa where they find Guinevere, liked the look of Hadrian's Wall and the castle (nice Round Table).&nbsp; I generally liked how the film was shot, too.&nbsp; What I liked about the setting mostly has to do with personal taste -- I'm not too keen on the sanitization of the medieval world.&nbsp; As my Old English professor would have said,  lif es sceort .&nbsp; And apparently dirty, too.  The casting was simply okay.&nbsp; Keira Knightley was kind of awkward as Guinevere, a&nbsp;bit wooden and not exactly a believable revolutionary in my opinion; aesthetically, she's par for the course for a Bruckheimer film -- she looks pretty good for a Celtic warrior, although I found her quasi-S&M warrior woman outfit at the end of the film to be a bit much.&nbsp; Mind you, I know the Celts fought in the nude (or damn close to it), and I'm not saying I want to see that (even with attractive people, war in the buff falls under bad naked as far as I'm concerned), it's just that this was a little too modern looking (possibly) for my taste.&nbsp; Owen makes a fine Arthur, but he's given damn little room to do much.&nbsp;&nbsp; This makes sense, as Arthur rarely does anything in any of the stories anyhow.&nbsp; I could have done without his tortured cry as he kneels over the corpse of Lancelot.&nbsp; It rang really false to me.&nbsp; As for the rest of the cast, meh.&nbsp; Nothing good, nothing bad, nothing notable I can think of right now.  I'll continue this tomorrow (with what I really didn't like and what type of Arthur movie I think people would want), but for now, it's bedtime.

      Apparently,  urlLink speculation has begun  that Bush will drop Cheney and replace him with either Colin Powell or even John McCain, fueled mostly by some comments by Al D'Amato.  This would be, according to the people quoted in the article, bad news for Democrats and Kerry-Edwards for two reasons -- Cheney's an easy target because of Haliburton and that sort of thing and because it would distract people from the DNC in a couple weeks.  I think the latter is more problematic, and the article sums up my opinion and thoughts fairly well:  “'Only dramatic events create dramatic opportunities to change these perceptions. Why? During dramatic events the public’s attention is fixated on nothing else but the event in question,' the memo says.   "A Cheney resignation would, it says, push Kerry and Edwards to the side. The news media coverage of who’d replace Cheney would be 'pervasive and overwhelming. With less than a week to the Democratic Convention, little attention is given to Senator Kerry’s policy and political agenda. The Democratic nominee is relegated to the second-tier of the news cycle.'"  As to the possible replacements, McCain would be somewhat dangerous -- he's generally well respected across party lines and he's competent.  Colin Powell could be, too, but I can't imagine him taking the VP position after the way he's been sandbagged by this administration over the last two years.  Almost every single time he came out and said something in response to anything, the administration came out and contradicted him.  The guy's on an island, and I can't believe he hasn't left yet.  [Don't ask about my title.  It sounded good when I first typed it, and I've got nothing better.]

       urlLink Dan Shaughnessy  has slammed Nomar again.  This one's simply ridiculous and wicked unfair: "Red Sox GM Theo Epstein came to Atlanta yesterday and suddenly all was right with the Sox. Nomar Garciaparra had three more hits, including a homer (so did the offday make all the difference or would one of those hits have won the game Thursday?), Curt Schilling fired a complete game, the brilliant Terry Francona knew enough to put Doug Mirabelli (grand slam) into the lineup, and the Sox snapped a four-game losing streak with a 6-1 win over the Braves."  Ignoring the swipe at Nomar, the crack on Francona's pretty unwarranted, too.  jugwine and jerseygirl, over at  urlLink Sportsfilter.com ,  urlLink say it better than I could :   jugwine : "Lesson #1 of Boston Media: Dan Shaughnessy makes his money off of exploiting the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry. It is therefore safe to completely ignore anything he has to say regarding it. In fact, it's better to just ignore him completely because he's nothing more than a  urlLink clown ."   jerseygirl : "First, it's Shaughnessy. He makes a living exploiting the fears and anger of Red Sox Nation and some of that is by way of the NY Boston rivalry. If he's not throwing out a hypothetical about 'The Yankees are going to sign Pedro/Nomar!' then it's 'We have a right to be angry about (insert minute issue here).' It took me a little while to understand why everyone in town hates him.  "Let me give you all an idea of how Shank operates. Within the last few months, he wrote an article wherein he spoke of himself as an owner of the Boston Red Sox. Shaughnessy works for the Globe. The Globe is owned by the NY Times. The Times has a small percentage ownership of the Boston Red Sox. He somehow deduced that he was a team owner. Someone on a message board pointed it out, so I checked it out. It was one of the most obnoxious self-indulgent articles I had read in a long time.  "If Shaughnessy isn't bitching about Manny, he's bitching about Pedro, and before that he was bitching about Carl Everett. Actually, for those who aren't in Boston, Carl Everett and Shaughnessy were mortal enemies. Carl Everett once called Shaughnessy a 'Curly Haired Boyfriend.' Funny stuff."  In other words, this article's pretty much par for the course.

      For the record, I didn't see this and I only have  urlLink this account .  "On the other side, we have Nomar Garciaparra, who sulked in the Red Sox dugout for the entirety of last night's game. Either he's getting traded, or he's determined to turn the city against him. Boston is a weird place. If everyone is standing at the top step of the dugout, and you're sitting awkwardly on the bench with a 'I wish this game would end, I could go for some pizza' face, you may as well just start strangling kittens on live TV at that point. I'm not a betting man -- okay, that's a complete lie -- but unless Nomar gets traded in the next 48 hours, I would bet that last night's game became one of his defining moments in Boston. And not in a good way."  Maybe he's right.  I don't know.  But on some level, I can't help but think that Simmons' ending is apocalyptic on the level of some of Dan Shaughnessy's columns.  It feels a bit piled on, to be honest.  I don't know if I blame Nomar for being a bit prickly.

       urlLink Earlier this week , I wrote down my initial impressions of the Beastie Boy's new album,  To the 5 Boroughs .  The real difference between that album and U2's  All That You Can't Leave Behind , which I compared it to, is that U2's album has "Beautiful Day," a truly great song.  There's no stand-out track on the Beasties album.  Nothing that grabs me or jumps out at me.  Also, the more I listen to the album, the more the lyrics to "Right Right Now Now" kind of bother me.  I agree with most of the sentiments, but there's something too facile about the lyrics.  They lack bite or edge or something that would make them stand out.

      I was reading Eric Neel's  urlLink column  on Page 2, and, according to these stats, Red Sox fans, everything is going to be okay.  I hope.  "Everyone is talking like this Yanks-Sox race is settled, but it's only July 1, folks. And if you hate the Yanks the way Jim Caple does and love the Red Sox as much as Bill Simmons does you'll want to hold onto these numbers: The Yankees have scored 415 runs through Wednesday, the Red Sox have scored 409; The Yankees have given up 357 runs, the Red Sox have allowed 358. Yes, there's a 7.5-game gap in the standings, but the gap rests on only seven runs difference in terms of performance. This thing is tight. The difference now is a little luck, and a little better job by the Red Sox of driving in runners in scoring position. Luck could decide to take a dance with Boston any time, and the gap in the standings could close right back up."  In other news, I can take a point of pride in noting that, of his all-bargain all-star team, I have Chone Figgins, Bobby Crosby, Michael Young, and Victor Martinez on my fantasy (rotisserie) baseball team (and had Lew Ford until I swapped him for Chone Figgins -- Kevin Youkilis, who had been my third baseman, is going to be a bit squeezed for playing time with Billy Mueller back).  Crosby, Young, and Martinez all came out of my draft (AL-only league), and I picked up Ford on waivers.  If only the folks I picked up in the first few rounds would work out, then I'd be set.  I certainly didn't waste my 4th round pick on Eric Hinske.  Not me.

      For maybe the first time, I think I agree with  urlLink Dan Shaughnessy .  I don't think Nomar's ever seemed so hostile to playing in Boston -- I'm mostly thinking of the way he repeatedly references his wanting to stay and what people say.   Update : No sooner do I start running my mouth off than Nomar starts going on a tear.  I'm not saying that Nomar's grievances aren't legitimate, only that we should get something for him if he's going to walk at the end of the year.  I'd hate to see him in a different uniform next year, but I'd hate for him to walk without us getting any compensation.

      I've been damn near silent lately.  It's mostly because I'm wrapping up my time in Chapel Hill and preparing to move back to the northeast, but it's also because I've been wicked busy.    I saw  Fahrenheit 9/11 .  I really liked it, but a few things about it made me uncomfortable.  The first thing was the audience.  It really gets my hackles up when people applaud during the movie, unless it's some sort of screening or premiere where people involved with the film were actually there.  Otherwise, who're you clapping for?  The projectionist?  Some people couldn't restrain themselves, clapping during the movie.  To me, it's as rude as talking or answering your cell phone at a film.  That's me.  The other problem I had was the manipulativeness of the film and its tendency to push things a little bit too far.  Ty Burr of the Boston Globe  urlLink explains this  better than I can:  "With the death of Lipscomb's son in Iraq, Moore himself turns exploiter. Her grief, of course, is genuine. So is our response to it. But when Moore prompts her to read her son's final letter out loud, and she cries helplessly as she does so, it becomes clear that the filmmaker's intrusiveness knows no bounds, and that he would sacrifice the dignity of even his beloved Flintians for political theater."  Too true.  All in all, I highly recommend it.  On the Michael Moore tip, I've bought (for $8 at  urlLink The Bookshop  in Chapel Hill, one of my favorite stores in the area)  Stupid White Men .  So far, no good (as a friend once noted of a book by Terry Eagleton, "No stars.  Pure Toilet.").  I don't appreciate being yelled at, and I certainly don't appreciate being yelled at by a book I want to agree with.  Michael Moore, at least as a writer, doesn't seem to respect his audience enough to show them where he gets his information and to lay off the rhetoric.  It's insulting.  Maybe it will get better.  I hope it does.  But so far, it's far less appealing and interesting to me than either of Molly Ivins's books,  Shrub  and  Bushwhacked , or Al Franken's  Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them , both of which are funny, sharp, and, to me, convincing, without being excessively polemical.  Moore could learn a lot from either of them (particularly Ivins in the latter book where she proposes solutions to problems -- something I liked very much).  In other news, a Florida teacher has been  urlLink arrested for having sex with a fourteen-year-old student  three times -- once in her classroom, once at her home, once in the back seat of her SUV while his fifteen-year-old cousin drove.  She's a fairly screwed up young woman, that much is clear, and this is sure to damage the kid she slept with.  I want to know what the hell was going on in his cousin's mind when he agreed to play chauffeur.  How do ask someone that, and why would they agree?  I'm not even going to comment about the outfit she's wearing in the AP photo.    According to a  urlLink new study , approximately ten percent of students are subjected to some form of sexual misconduct between kindergarten and grade 12.  Makes you wonder how many people are doing this and not getting caught.  I found two other articles at CNN.com about improper student-teacher relationships/interactions in the last week ( urlLink VA Teacher & Child Porn ,  urlLink Softball Coach & Player ).  That's all pretty damn screwed up.  In better, happier news, I've picked up the Beastie's new album,  To the 5 Boroughs .  It's slick and listenable.  Somewhat reminiscent of U2's  All That You Can't Leave Behind  in it's quality of production and, unfortunately, in its conservativeness.  It's a very well done and very safe album, particularly when you compare it to  Hello Nasty , which has a different sort of energy to it while still being a great album.  So, in the end, I guess you could say it's good, but it's not even close to being a  Paul's Botique , even though it's something of a return to that album's sound (especially in its use of samples).
