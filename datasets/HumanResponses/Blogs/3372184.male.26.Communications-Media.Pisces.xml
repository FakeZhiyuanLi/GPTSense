      My sister gave me a copy of  urlLink A Fine Balance  for my birthday and nearly three months later I'm finally finished reading it (I kept stopping to color in the pictures). So here's my review:  In the book, one of Rohintin Mistry's characters, Vasantrao Valmik, says:  "You see, you cannot draw lines and compartments, and refuse to budge beyond them. Sometimes you have to use your failures as stepping-stoens to success.  You have to maintain a fine balance between hope and despair ."  Well there's far too much despair and not a bit of hope in the book. And when the characters try to use their failures as stepping-stones, their hopes are equally dashed. In fact, it seems the book should be titled after the main characters mantra,"Everything Ends Badly."  Mistry is an excellent author and over the course of 500 pages he introduces you to more than a dozen detailed characters and makes you feel for all of them from a place deep in your heart. In fact, I was nearly late for work yesterday, because I had to finish the last 50 pages of the book before I got ready. But it turns out Mistry is a con-man, expertly pulling our heartstrings, then clipping them one by one.  If you like Dickens, you'll feel very comfortable with Mistry, but David Copperfield seems like a bedtime story compared to this tragic train wreck. If Mistry had left even a sliver of hope, a half-twisted grin on one of the characters faces, a twinkle in their eye instead of a tear, I would have put the book down satisfied. Instead, I felt forlorn, grief-struck and spiritually and emotionally demolished.  Of course, that's probably Mistry's goal: to make you feel the sense of desperation and hopelessness that pervades Indian life. His scathing political rebuke of Indira Ganhi's term as Prime Minister was an eye-opener to my unschooled mind and his harsh social commentary rung true to scenes I recall from my travels in India in 1995. But a picture of a gray horizon, no matter how masterfully painted, is not a masterpiece in my eyes, unless there is a hint of a coming break in the storm.

      Having wi-fi internet access has changed my life. Maybe that's oversimplifying or maybe I just was that stagnant. Anyway, as a music freak, I've really taken on to streaming internet radio.   The two best sites I've found are  urlLink 91X  and  urlLink WNRN    I grew up listening to 91X in San Diego and I've never found another alternative/modern rock station that's quite as good. The DJs know their stuff. They play a good mix of old, new, hard and softer stuff, plus they play a lot of independent and local music as well. My only complaint about their streaming radio is the commercial breaks get tedious because they have generic filler music during local ads.  I just discovered WNRN last year. I was driving from Roanoke to Washington DC and surfing the radio when I found this station playing great songs one after another, after another. And it wasn't the same cheesy stuff on most other stations, it was stuff I hadn't heard in a while (or had never heard at all). I think this is where I heard "Do You Realize?" for the first time. The station turned me on to the Flaming Lips and for that I am forever in their debt.  The best part of WNRN is their a public station, so they never have commercials (though the DJ will throw in a plug from time to time). And it's not all rock. The Boom Box plays a great mix of rap and hip-op at nights. Check it out. I see that their Board of Directors is considering getting rid of the audio stream so log on and  urlLink tell them to keep the audio stream    Enjoy!

      I managed to waste my days off fooling around on this Interweb. Among the more entertaining things I've seen is the  urlLink Sitepal  service, where you type something and can see and here a cartoon say it. Just click on the link, then click "try now" and then click "add audio." Enjoy!  I also have been catching up with old friends and found out that not one, but two old college classmates are now engaged. To Marcus and Whitney, congratulation, you've officially made me feel old and unwanted. Truly, I am really happy for them both. It's very exciting, but it is weird.  With Whitney I got that same feeling I had back at my college graduation. Where you realize that this particular moment a chapter in your life is completely and fully wrapping up. It's happiness, but bittersweet, because of it's immense finality.  With Marcus it was just a reminder that the old college days are indeed past. That the guys hanging out, will not be the same, because now there are significant others. But I hope it will be "the more the merrier."

      I'm putting you all on notice: I'm now a Blogger. Believe this!  Why now? Well....  I'm beginning my fifth incarnation.... a new life, in a new city with a new job and a new chance to make friends, prove myself and take the world by storm.... plus I now have wi-fi internet service and a laptop.  See life, like a book is made up of chapters. I seperate mine by location:  Preface: Montreal Chapter 1: San Diego Chapter 2: Chicago Chapter 3: Arizona Chapter 4: Roanoke, Virginia  and now I'm beginning to write Chapter 5: Richmond.  I recently began working at  urlLink NBC 12  in Richmond as a news reporter. I knew 3 people when I moved here, and had been to town once. So I have to start fresh.   Enjoy the journey...

      Do you ever watch "The Simpsons?" Do you know that character who plays the flamboyant moustached clerk and always over-stresses the word "Yes?" Who is that guy?  Well it turns out he's based on an old character actor named  urlLink Frank Nelson . Nelson acted in a ton of TV shows ranging from I Love Lucy to Sanford and Son and was known for that odd effeminate overpronunciation of the word "yes." Why would such a random icon have such a recurring role on "The Simpsons?"  Well it turns out the actual Frank Nelson had a recurring role as a clerk in another TV cartoon family: none other than "The Flintsones."  Apparently some believe the character is based on Vincent Price, but that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Others say Hal Perry, but I don't know who that is and a google search turns up nothing.
