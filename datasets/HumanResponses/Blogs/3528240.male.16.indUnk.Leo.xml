      So on Saturday I went in for my interview, and it seemed to go well. It would be one day/ week from 3-7. I hope I get it.  I'm watching a show about a lawyer who is defending an inuit guy who is supposed to have killed his adopted mother and brother, but he doesn't remember it. he has some obsession with TV, and his lawyer's in shit for not accepting an agreement. We'll see how it ends...  Later... So they find out he has a sleep disorder where he dreams while awake, and that's why he killed them. Think of a dream where you've killed someone; now imagine that you suddenly realized you weren't dreaming. That's what happened. But the fucking moron says he's guilty 'cause he feels guilty about it and he's getting these weird dreams where his adoptive brother blames him. But they find a way to get him off innocent, only to be sent from the community for two years because they're afraid of him killing them in a dream-state. The show would have been better if not for the CONSTANT ads for elections canada telling us to vote. Man, that is not gonna make me want to vote, I'm just bored now.

      Here's me hoping that Pete's book isn't a COMPLETE FAILURE like that Hulk movie....

      So I saw the new Potter movie, and it was only aight (that's about 3 1/2 stars). While the animation was good, it was way too different than the book. Here's a partial list of where the movie went off on a tangent:  - Instead of listening in on Weasley's dad and the minister of magic, Mr. Weasley tells Harry directly about Sirius - Harry doesn't get a note from Hagrid about the Monster Book of Monsters - Not enough teasing of Harry by Malfoy - NOTHING about blugworms (I think that's what they were called), the worms Hagrid has them study for the rest of the year - None of their exams - No house cup - The firebolt comes at the end, and isn't confiscated - No quiddich cup - Ron and Hermione don't listen to the minister, McGonagall, and the tavern witch talk about Sirius - Hermione successfully imitates the mating call of a werewolf (!?) - Harry doesn't think it odd that Lupin can read the map when it's supposedly a secret - Not much mention of Hermione's huge course load - No "Snape is poisoning Lupin!" theory  I mean, I've heard of Creative liberties, but come on! Yeah, I realize that none of this matters in the greater scheme of things, but it's nice to watch a movie adapted from a book and actually know what's gonna happen next. And that's my rant for today.

      Oh, man, I finally got a call back from this pharmacy near my house saying they want an interview with me!!!! It's been so long that I had already made a  SUPER  CRAPPY Flash ANIMATION!!! of the ordeal...          This was my first flash animation, and as such it sucks total ass, but I'm proud of it.

      Man, this homework stuff is pissing me off. I try and try to do this wolverine project, but it's SO BORING. Glad I have tomorrow night too...  Well, I'm getting Thief 3 for my XBox; it looks SWEET! I've got Thief 2 for my PC, and it's pretty good, but this looks  even better .  My mouse is messing up; every once in a while it goes all screwy and closes windows and stuff. It's getting really hard to play games.

      So I just had some pizza from POMODORO's, the best pizza joint in town. My oma brought me and the sibs for supper, after which we went to the indian foods store and got some sweets and samosas.  I did my french presentation today, it went better than I expected. Mostly because of my transitions; I used the mosaic thing on slow so it took about 10 seconds for the blurry squares to go away, at which point everyone was laughing. That, and my slow-bouncing pictures of Pasteur...  My Oma's gonna get me something (I get to choose); it's sorta a kind of tradition cuz she only comes here every year or so. What should I ask for? (Note: She's not all that rich, nothing stupid plz.)

      Yeah, my Oma is coming from Chicago for a visit; she was gonna come sooner but she broke her foot. And since, in my awesome wisdom, I chose many years ago to take over the guest room, I have to sleep on the floor in my brothers' room while she's here. But I can't really complain, she's the one who got me my guitar last year...  Anyway, it's pretty funny: she's about 80 years old, but she's in better shape than many people I know, including me.

      Here's a little gift from me: CRAPPY Flash ANIMATION!!!          Oh, and because I'm pathetic at flash, it starts automatically; just press F5 to start it over from the beginning.

      Man, I'm bored. High schools sucks when you've got work to do that they'll actually grade you on, not like that homework shit. Oh, man, I love that homework shit... it's so pointless that I don't do it and still get good marks (it's just that homework shit that actually counts that brings my mark down). Anyway, I've got a french presentation on Louis Pasteur, who realized that boiling microbes actually kills them (wow, how awesome...), I've got a science thing on wolverines to do which may bring my mark up to a 50 (but it's SO HARD because I keep getting sites on Wolverine from the X-Men written by geeks who know everything about him...  urlLink check it out ), AND THEN I have a civics exam/project on Doctors without Borders. And teachers wonder why we hate them... (this is why!)
