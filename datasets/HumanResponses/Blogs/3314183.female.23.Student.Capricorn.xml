      There's this some1 out there who's already made up his mind on tis gal. That he wana do well in uni bcos of her, frames up this v'day pic of them, places it on his desk for motivation and inspiration, knoes she's bored at work, promises to send her a new song everyday hoping tat will cheer her up. Oh by the way, he's in BNE. Thats why he cant do much. But is she gona break his heart like how the bad doppio broke hers? Babe ur so rite. Good guys always come in last. But maybe not this time round, she may just give him a chance.  But how bout the hot nose-pierce guy? Is she jus gona leave him aside? Dangling in mid air like wat doppio did to her? Haven tot of that yet.   Would you choose to be with some1 you love or some1 who's nice to you? She used to say "some1 I love!" but tat has always resulted in heartaches.  One after another. Without fail. Maybe it's time she chose some1's who's nice to her.  For it's better to be loved than to love.  Sent:  Thu 5/27/2004 12:13 AM   Subject: Just for you!!!!

      Vengence belongs to God.  He shall bring their plot to nothing. I shall not take things into my hands. He who sows bad seeds shall reap bad seeds.  Ps 31:1-5 In You, O'Lord, I put my trust; deliver me speedily; Be my rock of refuge, a fortress of defense to save me. For You are my rock and my fortress; lead me and guide me. Pull me out of the net which he has secretly laid for me, For You are my strength. Into your hand I commit my spirit; You have redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.  Ps 31:9-10,12 Have mercy on me, O Lord , for I am in trouble; My eye wastes away in grief, Yes, my soul and my body! For my life is spent with grief, my strength fails bcos of my iniquity. And my bones waste away. I am like a broken vessel.  Ps31:14-15,17-18 But I trust in You, O Lord; "You are my God." My times are in Your hand; deliver me from the hand of my enemies. Let the wicked be ashamed; let them be silent in the grave. Let the lying lips be put to silence.  Ps 31:24 Be of good courage, And He shall strengthen your heart, All you who hope in the Lord.  This is the third day without you. Have we ever not talked for 3 days? Never. Your passiveness has shown me clearly that you too know that you cannot give me what I want and it is true that you treat me like dirt. That was why you said, "Sorry, I disappointed you." Many times, I was tempted to ask you. Why? Why are you doing this to me? You promised you wouldn't be like him.  You promised to protect me and never let me be hurt again.  What is it that made you change? Why do you not want to be with me?  Is it something about me? Or is it just you? I am trying... Very hard indeed. To let go of you and all the promises you've made.  You gave me a dream. And you took it away. That's what you did.

      Silent prose for the lovely soul  Angel dust spattered across her wings Dreary lust begets the spring. Common folk stand and stare away when ever Adeline flies their way. Sorrow sprung from open heart Her eyes reveal her long lost thoughts Smile to melt the blizzardest of hearts, Mine you have captured without a thought.  I hope you like this poem. It took me some time  to think of it, but i think it fits you just  nicely. Enjoy and smile whenever you see me, for  I only want to bring joy to your life, and never  sorrow.  Love, Ben  Thanks Ben, thats so sweet of you. Your poem brought a smile to my face, a light to my dreary day.  Saturday May 22, 2004 marked a full stop for me and doppio. He will no longer sms nor will he ever call. It is painful. Truly, it is. Hurts so bad. so bad. But he is bad for me. They are all the same. All they can ever say is sorry. "i'm sorry" What good does saying that do? Nothing.  I should never have answered that call on saturday. But now I know, That I mean nothing to him. Absolutely nothing.  Him:'You don't wana contact me anymore isit?' Me:'Ya' Him:'If I don't call you, you wont msg me anymore is it?' Me:'Yes' Him:'I was sick for the past few days, it's not true that i don't wana tell you wat's going on here. I'm coming back next friday. Dad ask me to stay longer. It was last minute. I called my boss to ask to extend my leave.' Me:'Ya ya whatever.You've lied to me too many times.I find it hard to trust anything you say.' Him:'I've bought the thing for you already.I hope to see you when I'm back to pass it to you.' Me:'Why did you call?' Him:'Just to see wats happening. why ur not replying to my msgs.' Me:'I'd tell you whats happening ok. If you even bothered, you'd have called yesterday when i didnt reply to your msgs and not now, 24hours later and proclaim that you care. You! cannot give me what I want. I feel that you treat me like dirt! and I don't need a guy who treats me like dirt. I'm so glad you are in london. I should never have answered this phonecall!' Him:'I'm sorry I disappointed you. I'm sorry.' Me:'Sorry for what? whats there to be sorry about?' Him:'Sorry for everything. I hope to see you when I'm back.' Me:'We'd see.'  Answering your call disturbed me a great deal. I should never have.  I should have hardened my heart when your name appeared on my mobile.

      For in the time of trouble He shall hide me in his pavilion; In the secret place of His tabernacle He shall hide me; He shall set me high upon a rock. Ps27:5  Lord, you say tat in times of trial O'Lord You'd hide me from the evils of this world. Father I pray that you do it now O'Lord The cruelty of this world is becoming too much to bear. Take it O'Lord, take it. I lift up all my burdens, all my fears, all my worries. I lift them up unto you right now Father. I give them all to you Lord. Guide me Lord, protect me and lead me as only you can. I need you Father. Be with me always, I pray.  Wait on the Lord; Be of good courage, And He shall strengthen your heart; Wait, I say, on the Lord! Ps27:14  The Lord is my strength and my shield; My heart trusted in Him, and I am helped; Therefore my heart greatly rejoices, And with my song I will praise Him. Ps28:7  Truly Lord, you are my strength, my portion and my shield, You gave me strength to carry on, to pull through all of my days.  The Lord will give strength to His people; The Lord will bless His people with peace. Ps29:11  dearest kym, Lets brave through this together, There are many more tomorrows waiting for us to conquer. Let us not be stuck in this phase of our life for too long, They are but passing clouds in our lives. And this I promise you, that after the storm will come the sunshine. -Ade-

      Why did you msg again? Am I glad that you did? Maybe I am, maybe I'm not. Cos all you ever talk about is your flu. Your mother f***king bloody flu.  Everything is about you. you're cold over there, you're having a flu, you've got not enough warm clothes. Every bloody thing is about you, yourself and you. YOU ARE the MOST SELFISH PRICK I've seen in this bloody f***ing world.  Why do you even msg then? I feel like I'm sinking. I can't breathe. I must be biggest idiot in the world. You are bloody lying straight in my face. YET! YET! I'm f***ing taking it. Taking it all in. Without any confrontation. Without even asking for an explanation.  Ask you when coming back. F***ing tell me you duno. When the bloody date was already confirmed two weeks ago. F***ing think I'm an idiot right. Maybe u knoe tat I koe. But it's like so what if u koe I'm lying. If ur not happy about it, wanna leave, feel free to ya. Nobody's stopping you.  I'm such a loser. Allow myself to be manipulated by you.

      To find love, the first step is to open my heart, but I've had past hurt,low self-esteem,grudge and resentment. How do I find love? Yes, I can.  Love will gradually erase past hurt from my current system. It will remain in my permanent memory, but it will no longer disrupt my life no more.  Love will eventually overcome my low self-esteem but first, I have to take grudge and resentment away for they prevent me from experiencing the ultimate power of love. But I don't know how to...  The word is forgiveness. The power of forgiveness is miraculous.. really it is.. I have to forgive before I can love again. And I have to learn to love myself before I can love others. To realise my worth, To acknowledge my limitations, To remove self-criticism, to empty it. To make sure it never comes back ever again. And then peace, contentment and smiles will fill my life once again.  You are so right my dear smu fren, I am a girl who will not be afraid to love again despite past hurts. And I thank God for that.

      Its 5.30pm now. I hate to be thinking of this. Like hey wat's the time in london now? Why didnt he msg me? I hate to be doing this to myself.  Why should i even be thinking about him when he doesnt If all he can talk to me about  WHEN HE'S IN LONDON is "oh i'm having a bad flu, a bad nose,dying liao" then so be it. Wat else can i say? And the next thing tat comes is "oh i'm at starbucks working on my work" Reali tats all tat i mean to him I'm never good enough for him to have any real conversation with. He sux. Big time.  But think of it this way, Its gotta end someday sweetie. If it's not today, its tomorrow, next week, next month, 3 months later, 6 months later or a year later Its gotta end. Someday, somehow. You can hold on to this for the next 6 months and nothing's gonna change. He's not gona turn around and say, "Hey gal,let's be together.  I wana be with you". No!Its not gona happen that way. Never is it gona be. So stop dreaming oki? Wake up from your dream. There's many out there who loves and cares for you. Why do you only want attention from him? Do you wana be with a guy who treats you like dirt? Be strong my dear. Get him out of your system. Give yourself one month to get him out of your head, out of your life. Truly, if you wana build a new life, you gotta break free from the 3 of them. You're doing great for the other 2. So what's stopping you from this last one? Baby he's the last one. Break free from him and you can truly say to yourself. My new life has began. One month darling And off you go to Tioman. Doesn't it sound like a great plan? Do it gal. You can do it.

      The most important, most critical component in successful loving is  commitment.  Not love.  Which is exactly what you lack.  It's easy to love without commitment. You do it all the time.  Easy to love, to give of yourself for a while.   It's easy to sweet talk. Anyone can do that. Words are free,adel. Words are free.  But commitment implies  bonding in such a way that  one promises to keep the fires of  love burning indefinitely.   It also means shutting one's heart to the  possibility of loving another who  might even be more attractive, even more lovable.  It is not easy.  This is why solid commitments are not at all as common as we are led to believe.   Love cannot be measured and that is a huge problem. I can love someone and tell him "I love you"  and I'm telling the truth. But how much do I love him? Enough to let him court me? Enough to want to marry him? Enough to be willing to die for him?  Which is it?   The greatest test of true love is commitment. And the greatest indicator of deep love is deep commitment. There can be no doubting this.   You often say all the right words, make all the right moves and pledge all that crappy everlasting undying love, But I know you'd walk away in weeks or months to come.  Maybe even overnight, You'd change. Faster than the speed of light.  Were we ever in love? Sure we were.  But not enough to allow us to hold strong in our love. Not enough to keep a commitment regardless of the pain.

      Eve was not taken out of Adam's head to top him, neither out of his feet to be trampled by him, but out of his side to be equal with him, under his arm to be protected by him, and near his heart to be loved by him.  wow how beautiful is that.. finally i understand the purpose of creating Eve out of Adam's rib...  What did God have in mind when He made two sexes? What is His plan?  God has made us male and female to tell a story too marvelous for us to fully comprehend. He has made the sexes different from each other to reflect a reality that existed before we did. Following God's script for our sexuality in every scene in our lives means that we are depicting the truth and faithfully telling His story. And when we do that, we experience the fullness of life that God wants for us as men and women.  His plan leads to our joy and fulfilment.  God assigned men and women different roles. God made Adam first, Signifying his unique role as leader and initiator. He created Eve from Adam and brought her to Adam to be his helper in the tasks God had assigned him. She was made to complement, nourish and help her husband. God’s greatest gift to man was “a helper suitable for him”.  Men and women were created equal, yet different. God didn’t make us to duplicate each other, but to complement each other.  “ The world cries for men who are strong- strong in conviction,  strong to lead, to stand, to suffer.” I pray that you will be that kind of man, my dearest doppio. Be glad that God made you a man, Be glad to shoulder the burden of manliness in a time when to do so will often bring contempt.  If a man’s greatest temptation is to be passive, A woman’s greatest temptation is to take control. The man isn’t setting a course,  so the woman grabs the steering wheel. It might fix things in the short term, But in the long run it only discourages men from playing their God-given role as initiators.  I can encourage men to be men by refusing to do the work of leading for them. I want to avoid developing a habit of initiating in my relationship with men.  But now with doppio, Somehow, somewhat, sometimes, I have became the initiator......

      There was this day, Me and my dear SMU friend were outside the library, Discussing how many close gal frens we have.. Sadly, I only came up with 4.. She probably has 13 or more... Today, I'm glad to tell her that I've been working hard to build my strong sisterhood. And now I am glad to say that I've doubled my number. Huh! Think only guys have strong MFBH?  We gals have strong sisterhood as well. Agreed babe?  With MY GOD I can scale ANY mountain, 2Sam22:30(NLT)  Thats from Alice babe, My dearest sister from cell.  She's this really sweet darling gal who has recently found her Godly partner Who happens to have eyes that makes gals in our cell melt... Oki I'd stop teasing you babe.  God is kind to me. He knows that I am weak at a time like now, Easily swayed, influenced and defeated. And He has blessed me with good frens like her. She never fails to motivate me with the Word of God. Such a kind and strong soul she is.  God answers prayers in 3 ways. Yes, No and Wait. I have prayed about this. There is no answer yet. God is probably saying WAIT. Delay is not denial.  If u haven seen the direction yet,dun stop prayin...ask God to open ur eyes so dat u can see what's His will for u in this.  James 1:5-6 in NLT version sez:  If u need wisdom, if u want to know what God wants u to do, ask him n he'll gladly tell u.  He will not resent your asking.  But when u ask Him,  be sure that you really expect Him to answer,  for a doubtful mind is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.  The best thing God can do for me is to repeat the miracle He has done.. So the best thing He can do for me now is to deliver me outta this Espresso guy.  The Word of God is like a double edged sword. It is able to pierce the heart of man n separate what is black n what is white.  The gettin out process is tough but Ade's God is a mighty God.  We've to go thru things we dun like in life at times  And it's cuz God loves us too much to let us remain the same person... He wants to see u changed..to be a better person.  Den we can be a testimony to the people in the world. So dat in future when people are in this position, we can tell them how we got out of this  And lead them to God cuz God has the ultimate solution.  Everytime we do something dat we noe God duzen want us to do,  God's actually waiting for us to come back to Him  And whenever we decide to come back to God, He'll alwiz welcome us with open arms.

      Dear Lord, I'm not a perfect person. Indeed, there's many things i wish i didnt do. But i continued learning O'Lord I never meant to do those things to you.  I just want you to know Father... That I've found a reason for me, To change who i used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you Lord.  I'm sorry tat I hurt you  That's something I've to live with everyday. And all the pain I put u thru I wish that I can take it all away.   And that's why i need u to hear Father, I found a reason for me, To change who I used to be A reason to start over new..and the reason is you Lord. Truly God...the only reason I live is because of you.  And to you who hurt me time and time again, You have a really disgusting habit. Empty promises that is. Why say all this to me only to break all your promises at the end of the day? Lying has became an integrated part of you. You lie like there's no tomorrow.  ice says: hahah .. no lah.. i will even call u when i there just like lassst time.. lol Me says: why must lol at the end of your msg? ice says: dunno.. cos u think i wun call u mah ..  Me says: can u do me a favour eh? ice says: what? ice says: why u copy and paste? Me says: can u rem tis? wat i copied n pasted ice says: yes...

      You said you liked me Wow how true can that be Take note that the like came with a d - liked  Yes you did, in the past maybe You have changed my dear So much.  You are no longer who I used to know No longer the Doppio so sweet, so real. I don't want to be your meantime girl no more.  All you ever made were empty promises Yet I chose to entrust my heart to you Now, This hurt is squirming its way into me.   If you really do like me You would have time for me You wouldn't do the MIA time and time again.  I loved you. I really did.  But you are not the one for me Neither am I for you You must be really happy now that I've decided to leave.  You are not in God's plan for my future You are in God's plan that I would learn something from this God planted you into my life because He wants me never to repeat this mistake ever again.  But know what... If I could survive what happened four months ago, I can survive this.  If God brings you to it God will bring you through it.

      Seeking a life of security and physical ease, free from any problem or disturbance. It is essential that I break down any opposition that could possibly lurk in the shadows.  I would like to be involved with a particular person but no, I shall hold back.  Suppressed agitation is in me.  I am finding it increasingly difficult, if not impossible to relax.  Driving myself to a state which is possibly beyond the capacity of my resources.  Trust and self-esteem have been lost. I am unable to do anything to restore the belief, affinity and mutual trust.  I feel powerless to change the situation. Unfulfilled emotional requirements, experiencing mental and physical stress. I am attempting to escape from this by endeavoring to create a semblance of peace and serenity by refusing to allow myself to be involved. But...I know...I will have the strength to 'pull through'... perhaps sooner than I even believed possible.

      Love? What is it truly? Friendship? What is it truly? Is it worth losing friendship over love? If you had a choice, which one would you have chosen? Sometimes, the choice, just can't be chosen. You have no choice to pick the correct choice.... Friendship is worth keeping. Definitely. Never, EVER, give up friendship For that'd be wat keeps you going in times of trouble. Of cos not forgetting my dear prince, Jesus Christ.  Thank you Lord for showing me your grace over the past week. I wouldn't have survived if not for your strength and grace. As You said in the holy bible, You will strengthen me as I stand upon Your Word. I don't feel that I'm totally ok now.That I am total independent of him but at least I must say its much better than two weeks ago.  He's back. And he called. He said he smashed his phone after talking to me two saturdays ago. What is this? Another lie?   You are a scary person. Too unpredictable.  Too smart that I can't tell when ur lying and when ur not.  You say you really did miss me when you were in London.  That you tried calling me thru public phones but couldn't get thru. That's what ur best at. Isn't it? Blaming the telecomms company.  Remember how you used to teach me this trick? Yuo couldn't even tell me you'd miss me when I asked you b4 you left. Now ur back. You wana meet me. To pass me the stuff you bought for me like what you claimed. You want to talk to me. Finally you want to. To get it over and done with. You didn't want to talk about us before you left for London. Remember?  And I let you go without forcing you to talk. Now I don't wana see you.  For seeing you is gona upset my whole biological system.  I spent an entire week trying to get you outta my system, my life. I prayed. I prayed really hard. And when I didn't hear from you for a week, I tot to myself. Thats it. God has showed me the way.   And now ur back telling me your granddad has jus passed away.  I'm sorry about what happened to your granddad. I wana be there for you as a fren but I can't bear seeing you. My emotional baggage is simply too heavy.  Seeing you would be like unearthing all the memories I've been trying so hard to bury.  I hate to see you leave. Your back facing me, you heading down that corridor towards the lift. I hate the end of our conversations. To have to hang up after we talk. I'm glad you wana be frens with me. But you know it. I can't. At this moment, I can't only be frens with you.   hey can someone just teach me how to post those darn pictures into this blog please.  its getting on my nerves. haha. and yea how do I send sms online? haha..

      Maybe school should start, maybe it isn't so bad.  Gets my mind working, gets my mind off things.  But is it worse to be feeling sucky and have plenty of deadlines to meet?  Or is it worse to be feeling sucky and have nothing to do?  Maybe the bad dreams were a sign. But I just refuse to believe&nbsp;the sign.  Ok maybe now I should start believing. Everything's going off track.  Everything and everyone. Geez. Trapped right here. Can't breathe. Suffocating.  Disoriented. Seeing pepz starting school. Phobia. Arrghs..  Aaarghhhs.. him.. him again.. when can I ever be done with him..  4 months of hols ain't enuff to get him out.. geez.. restless today..  Quiet phone - squirmy. Him - disturbing.  -Nose pierce- hurt. sad. wounded. How?  -me- Out of tune. Berserk. Cranky. Life sux. Bad day.  Okay. Its gona get better later. Maybe its jus pms.

      You have eyes that don't see; ears that don't hear; a heart that doesn't perceive. What do you do with someone like that? Do you persist or do you give up on him? Do you still try to&nbsp;love&nbsp;the person when all he ever does is to inflict hurt and pain upon you? But is he all that bad? Has he no goodness within him? Probably there is.  But the eyes are still blinded; the ears are still muffled; the heart is still closed.  It is harder for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God than for a camel to go thru the eye of a needle.  A man of&nbsp;weak integrity. That's what you are. I'm not perfect. I have many flaws. But i know I hold on to my promises much stronger than you do.  I pray you'd&nbsp;be a man of great&nbsp;faith, walk with the righteous and&nbsp;quit being unequally yoked.  Cos God loves you and I too much to allow us to stay the same.  We were never meant to be. We've started out on the wrong foot but I will still love you as a brother-in-Christ.  Jesus said, "In this world, you shall have tribulations. But be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world."

      She came thirsty. Thirsty from guilt, thirsty from regret.  Thirsty from countless nights of lovemaking and finding none.  And when He hands her the goblet of grace, she drinks.  She doesn't just taste or nip.  She doesn't just dip her finger and lick it or take the cup and sip it.  She lifts the liquid to her lips and drinks, gulping and swallowing like the parched pilgrim she is.  She drinks until the mercy flows down her chin and onto her neck and chest.  She drinks until every inch of her soul is moist and soft.  She comes thirsty and she drinks. She drinks deeply.   he, on the other hand, doesn't even know he's thirsty.  People like him don't need grace; they analyze it.  They don't request mercy; they debate and prorate it.  It wasn't that he couldn't be forgiven; he just never asks to be.   So while she drinks up, he puffs up. While she has ample love to give,  he has&nbsp;no love to offer. "A person who is forgiven little shows only little love."  We can't give what we've never received.  If we've never received love, how can we love others?   Receive first, love second.   So thirsty for God's love. Those who should have loved didn't.  Those who could have loved didn't. Left at the altar. Left with an empty bed.  Left with a broken heart. Left with "Does anybody love me?"   God loves me. Personally. Powerfully. Passionately. Others have promised and failed.  But God has promised and succeeded. God loves me with an unfailing love.  And his love&nbsp;- if I will let it - can fill me and leave me with a love worth giving.   So come. Come thirsty and drink deeply.

      You never fail to frustrate me in the most miraculous ways no one ever tot of.  She's so right. Someday ur gona kick yourself in the ass for not getting out of this when you cud.  I gave you my all. My soul, my trust, my love, my energy, my time.  But what has resulted from it?&nbsp;You've abused it. &nbsp; Am I selfish to think of having something in return? I am.  So messed up. The chapter is not closing. But it has to be closed. It has to be.  In my quest of searching for God's presence, I've neglected a crucial point.  A point&nbsp;that gave me such revelation.  Yes perhaps I started it all. And now I'm blaming him.  But I would most definitely say that it's been mutual.  But now's the time to stop. If not now, then when?   -nose pierce-  What can I do about us? You are so nice. So stable. Such a great pal you have been.  But there is a heart that does not perceive. It hurts me to hurt you. I never want to.  Never intended to but if I went ahead, it definitely isn't God's will.  And then the vicious cycle wud repeat itself.  I've told you my priorities. But you don't seem to get them in.  Things won't change because I'm serious with God.  Loving me wud hurt you. And I can't let this go on. Love yourself. Be kind to yourself. &nbsp; This is so beautiful.  God withholds what we desire in order to give us what we need.  You desire a partner; he gives you himself.  You seek a larger church; he prefers a stronger church. You want to be healed so you can serve. He wants you to be confined so you can pray. &nbsp; Love...does not boast, it is not proud. 1Cor 13:4 That's what love does. It puts the beloved before itself.  Your soul was more important than His blood.  Your eternal life was more important than His earthly life. Your place in heaven was more important to Him than His place in heaven, So He gave up His so you could have yours.

      -Surfers' Paradise-  Woah your email is even longer than mine and I tot mine was long already. You gave me Surprise number 1 when you said "Firstly,most of the things that you told me in this email I have already anticipated". How did you anticipate all that? Surprise number 2, "All these i cud tell from the way you communicated with me". ??? (Eyes wide open)*blink blink*   -Why do I think you are the right one for me- (Gritting on teeth..Eyes open wider) I tot of you as a very jovial and easy going person.  Pretty 50%. The rest of the 50 % boils down to charisma. I realised you've got some problems which led me to want to know you more. I just felt I wanted to help you out. This care and concern has in fact been growing. Until you slowly started to confide in me.  Thus, now this care and concern has became love. I just feel that I would like to protect you.  Emotionally, you seem very fraglie indeed. I do cherish every moment talking to you because it makes me understand you more. I know its getting one sided in terms of my feelings for you.  But i do hope that you will be happy thats all.  I understand that at the moment you are not prepared to enter into a relationship and i had also expected that because of the problems you have. Like i said, i will respect your decision yea. No worries. And i dun wan you to have an extra burden because of me. If you are unhappy, I'd be sad too. So its not good for both of us either. So dun worry about me yea. I am an open minded and optimistic person. I would still be the usual ***** that u can look for comfort and encouragement.  Love, *****

      There's an internal struggle.. maybe the angel and devil are fighting. Such a tough battle to conquer. A war to combat the weak flesh, to build up the spirit. Maybe we shouldn't be seeing each other until we learn to respect each other. You're still keeping me in the shadows. I don't want us to become another Roger and ilynn. Always talking about God yet always repeating the cycle, falling into the trap the devil has so carefully camouflaged. I feel disgusted even to put their names on my blog.   For you, it's just pretty impossible for us to be only friends given our characters and what's been happening. But it's not only you. There's another.  But as for him, I want him to know. God comes first. God is number one.   Enough is enough. Yes. Frustrated, rejected, used. That's what it is.  Scared, lonely, empty. Is that how it's supposed to be? Fighting back but truly. The going is tough. Extremely in fact.  Would leaving me alone work? Probably yes.  Low self-esteem accompanied by the "I'm not worthy" feeling.  Take it Lord please. I can't handle this.   I'm a fighter and always on the defensive. Always needing to make sure that my position is established and safe. Pent-up emotions. Am I trying too hard here? But You have to change me before You can use me. I'm afraid of the dark.  Please show me a way out. Out of this never ending darkness.   I'm still a clay, raw as can be, ugly as it is, untouched, unshaped.  Lord purify this clay I pray, then mould it Lord, into a pot, a vase, a vessel, anything that You deem fit. Purifying is hard work. Strenuous.

      Lord, I pray you give me peace so I'd be able to pray.  Let there be peace in my heart so I'd know what to pray for and how to. Everything's so messed up. Tots and feel and all..   Let this be a different prayer from the rest. Let this not be a regular, mediocre prayer. Let this be a strong prayer. A fervent prayer.  Allow me to dig in deep to retrieve the hidden secrets tat ought to be prayed about.   Truly Lord, there's none other who's greater than you. I ask for God's hand to be upon me and my family. I pray for a great financial breakthrough in my family.  Lord as I work towards breaking out of my bad habits, I pray Lord that you'd give me a breakthrough in my life. A spiritual breakthrough. A financial breakthrough. Lord I pray that my private worship will be more beautiful to you than my public worship. Before I think of helping others, I have to first strengthen myself. Strengthen my faith, my knowledge of the Word, I pray for the anointing of the Holy Spirit. To refresh me, renew my mind, convict my heart and change my life.   Father I want to be able to pray strong like the rest. Not to be afraid of prayer meetings. Not to be fearful of not knowing how to pray. For the Bible says, "Be strong and of good courage, for I am with you always, even to the ends of the earth."  Lord I pray that'd be no distractions in my life to take me away from You. Take all these distractions and temptations away. I want to focus on You. To know you more. To serve You. Dear Jesus, more than anything else, I want to know You more intimately. I want to know You more. I pray for a personal encounter with the Holy Spirit that'd change my life.   Holy Spirit, help me break the sin of silence, help me to be bold to speak of Jesus to my friends. That you'd put the right words in my mouth. That I'd invite them at the right time. That their hearts would be so open. And that I'd be a great testimony. That my frens and family will see the change in me bcos of Jesus. And they'd believe that God is a good God. That as I ask my frens to church, I'd not be discouraged, not be scared if I get rejected. But that I'd keep trying and trying. Keep believing and believing. And trust that as I sow the seed today, somewhere along the way, someone else will reap the fruits of labour and my frens and family would be saved.   I pray O'Lord that me and him will remain as frens. Truly Lord, let Your kingdom come, Your will be done. Not my will. Not his will. But Your will Lord. If he's the one, You'd tell me. You'd give me a sign. But before I hear anything from You Lord. Let us just remain as frens. Maybe we'd always only be frens. If that's your will dear Jesus, then let it be. Dear Lord, I don't want to force anything that's not supposed to be. I'm tired of fighting, of struggling. I give it all to You. I pray You'd fight in my place. For You are the Father Almighty. The king of kings. And the Lord of Lords.  Help me to be more Christ-like. To curb the bad temper. To be meek. To be more respectful. To be more patient. Not to be judgmental. Not to be weak or to think lowly of myself. Help me build self esteem. That one day, my light will shine. I'd be the salt and light to the world. Lord, I believe you've given me a dream. To be a missionary for you dear Lord. To win souls for you. To plunder hell and populate heaven in Jesus name. So, mould me dear God. To become the person You want me to be. To fulfill the destiny You have for me in this lifetime. Help me forsake the relationships that I have to forsake. Change the ways that needs to be changed. Abandon the habits that should be left behind. My new man has been born. Now let my new man be strong. Help me handle my finances well. Help me lead a strong prayer life. To be spiritually filled as well as biblically well equipped.   And finally, I pray for God's presence to be with me every single day of my life. Holy Spirit, fall upon me. Help me make the right decisions in life, in school, at home, at work. I love You and I praise you. In Jesus mighty name I pray, Amen.

      Now that ur back, I look not beyond today.  Never knowing when ur going to turn your back and change.  Mustering whatever courage I have left to give you another chance.  To pray for you and help you grow. Thats what you've asked of me.  I've opened up my heart, my life to you once again.  Please lie no more. For even if you fool me..you can't fool God.He knows.. And this time, if you decide to leave, I will be sad, no doubt. But I am prepared. I'm so tired of fighting, of struggling with you and with myself.  If it's God's will that you'd leave. You will. No matter how hard I try, how hard I fight. Its all gona be fruitless. Go if you want.  I've hidden in the shadows long enough. I want to be in the sunshine. If all you can offer is late night trading then forget it. I dont want you.  Trust. Such a crucial factor. Yet I've lost all of it in you. How can we possibly have a start this way? When all trust has been lost even before anything has even started. They are all persuading me to leave you. Not to even have you as a fren.  Not to ever bother about what happens to you cos ur jus not worth it.  Cos ur an unstable guy. Not to mention spiritual maturity. Even the basic requirements of trust and stability you can't provide. They are afraid you'd hurt me again. That I'd sway away from God if we ever got together cos ur not really a Christian to many. Your heart isn't with God. But I'm always giving you the benefit of the doubt. That maybe this time ur gona change. Maybe this time ur not lying. Maybe this time ur serious about turning to God.   Disappoint me no more.. will you? Help me to help you. If you don't even want to help yourself, how do you expect me to help you..  Or maybe I'm just not in the position to help.. cos i'm not even ok myself.  Praying..

      When a person passes on, is his entire life time worth only a dash?  Would you want your life to be worth only an RIP and a 1967-2023 dash? Definitely not. Its not what happens in your life that matters.  Its the legacy you leave behind.  A person's legacy is measured by the number of people he has touched when he's living. Death doesnt end a person's life. It's a beginning as his legacy endureths forever.  Think I've found my dream, my purpose. I'm willing to move, if God would send me.  To the ends of the earth I would go. God if that is Your will for my life. To be a great missionary, to fulfill the Great Commission, I may not preach but I would go. If that is Your voice that I'm hearing, I would go. For missionaries touch hearts and change lives.  To make a difference in the world, even if it means a small difference,  for there to be one, every individual counts. May I be that one.

      It's like a seed, planted by someone in the heart, which nurtures and grows. Sweetness can be found when it bears fruit. Love can be sweet or bitter jus as fruit. But i gez if u pick it when it's ripe... the sweetness will astound you.   What is love?  Understanding it has its own mastery.  How is it like to love?  The thought of it makes one jittery.   Nought to be afraid.  For love, is the wondrous gift given by God, O great!   Love is like a fruit-growing process.  The seed of love sowed by its own prince.  Moved by his loving kindness.  The roots finally extend to greatness.   Stay rooted in the mind, they hold firm.  It’s in the one’s presence, the heart yearns. The stem stands erected with significant measure.  Only in his presence, I can find pleasure.   The branches stretch like love with arteries.  Without love, my life falls into a crisis.  Lush of leaves and flowers,  Pours out a fragrance of romance for lovers.   Bearing fruits of passion,  Come, taste the sweetness, needless to question.  Back onto the ground, the seed fell once again.  Flow with the waters to the place love once began.

      Had a long break.. finally back.. 12days.. was nice..  But back with giddiness in the head.. unwell..  Deadline on monday.. rushing work now.. argh.. Mike's looking tired too..  Was sighing on his way in.   Rawa was nice. Very nice indeed lest the charges of the miscellaneous.. Serene, blue and deep.. wif shades of blue which differentiated the waters. Blooming wif rainbow fishes, Nemo look-alikes, stingray, guppy look-alikes.. Breathing thru the mask was a task.  Sparks flew.. but he who ignited the spark wasn't so fortunate afterall.  For she didn't quite appreciate the sparks flying in her direction.   Hong Kong was fine but not quite fun.  Nice scenery on Lamma.. plenty of hill climbing and ferry rides.  Expensive public transport.. nice pigeons on the dinner table..  Small, cramped up flats.. buildings so close to each other that the bamboo pole used for hanging clothes can aid in climbing over to the opposite block. Much shopping to be conquered.. That pretty much describes Hong Kong.

      Chanced upon this and was deeply inspired.. so tot I'd post it..  Something to ponder... God : Hello. Did you call me? Me: Called you? No.. who is this? God : This is GOD. I heard your prayers. So I thought I will chat. Me: I do pray. Just makes me feel good. I am actually busy now. I am in the midst of something. God : What are you busy at? Ants are busy too. Me: Don't know. But I cant find free time. Life has become hectic. It's rush hour all the time. God : Sure. Activity gets you busy. But productivity gets you results. Activity consumes time. Productivity frees it. Me: I understand. But I still cant figure out. By the way, I was not expecting YOU to buzz me on instant messaging chat. God : Well I wanted to resolve your fight for time, by giving you some clarity. In this net era, I wanted to reach you through the medium you are comfortable with. Me: Tell me, why has life become complicated now? God : Stop analyzing life. Just live it. Analysis is what makes it complicated. Me: why are we then constantly unhappy? God : Your today is the tomorrow that you worried aboutyesterday. You are worrying because you are analyzing. Worrying has become your habit. That's why you are not happy. Me: But how can we not worry when there is so much uncertainty? God : Uncertainty is inevitable, but worrying is optional. Me: But then, there is so much pain due to uncertainty.. God : Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional. Me: If suffering is optional, why do good people always suffer? God : Diamond cannot be polished without friction. Gold cannot be purified without fire. Good people go through trials, but don't suffer. With that experience their life become better not bitter. Me: You mean to say such experience is useful? God : Yes. In every terms, Experience is a hard teacher. She gives the test first and the lessons afterwards. Me: But still, why should we go through such tests? Why cant we be free from problem? God : Problems are Purposeful Roadblocks Offering Beneficial Lessons (to) Enhance Mental Strength. Inner strength comes from struggle and endurance, not when you are free from problems. Me: Frankly in the midst of so many problems, we don't know where we are heading.. God : If you look outside you will not know where you are heading.Look inside. Looking outside, you dream. Looking inside, you awaken. Eyes provide sight. Heart provides insight. Me: Sometimes not succeeding fast seems to hurt more than moving in the right direction. What should I do? God : Success is a measure as decided by others. Satisfaction is a measure as decided by you. Knowing the road ahead is more satisfying than knowing you rode ahead. You work with the compass. Let others work with the clock. Me: In tough times, how do you stay motivated? God : Always look at how far you have come rather than how far you have to go. Always count your blessing, not what you are missing. Me: What surprises you about people? God : when they suffer they ask, "why me?" When they prosper, they never ask "Why me" Everyone wishes to have truth on their side, but few want to be on the side of the truth Me: Sometimes I ask, who am I, why am I here. I cant get the answer. God : Seek not to find who you are, but to determine who you want to be. Stop looking for a purpose as to why you are here. Create it. Life is not a process of discovery but a process of creation. Me: How can I get the best out of life? God : Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence. Prepare for the future without fear. Me: One last question. Sometimes I feel my prayers are not answered. God : There are no unanswered prayers. At times the answer is NO. Me: Thank you for this wonderful chat. I am so happy to start my life with a new sense of inspiration. God : Well. Keep the faith and drop the fear. Don't believe your doubts and doubt your beliefs. Life is a mystery to solve not a problem to resolve. Trust me. Life is wonderful if you know how to live. "Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that took your breath away! "

      The paragraph goes like this: -  God whispers in our souls and speak to our hearts. Sometimes we don't have time to listen, He has to throw a brick at us. It's our choice to listen or not. If God had a refrigerator, your picture would be on it. If He had a wallet, your photo would be in it. He sends you flowers every spring; He sends you a sunrise every morning. God didn't promise days without pain, laughter without sorrow, sun without rain, But He did promise strength for the day, comfort for the tears, and light for the way.   "Called her midweek... Always couldn't help it... Things are getting complicated and i'm not getting better... Just that i never show it on the surface. Nobody knows how i'm feeling inside... None of my friends knew... I don't know what to do with her anymore... Everything seems wrong... Someone... I wished someone could save me from this........."   Is this me? Geez..I hope not.. well.. he (not the Stonehenge he) didn't call me midweek.. he called on monday.. and we didnt talk for the rest of last week until saturday.. hmmmz.. maybe it's ede he's referring to.. But if it's me then I did him great wrong.. as in first I go.. really I can't love no one. Then the next thing tat happens is, I get real guilty then I'd call to ask if he's alright or he'd call cos he can't help it..and we start talking again.. and when we don't meet up, I'd miss him (I don't tell him tat..) But I just really don't want to lose him. He's been my great, great pal for 5 years! geez.. do u know how long that is..? He's probably thinking like wat's up with you.. make up your mind.. geez.. wat to do.. wat to do..
