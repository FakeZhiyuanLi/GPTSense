      While watching the Dems convene this afternoon I saw back to back random crowd shots of Miranda from Sex and the City and Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.  Regardless, it's still not as much fun as playing "Spot the Minorities" at the Republican convention used to be.  Patrick, any chance you're in Boston, or still slaving away in the Dakotas?

      So I get into work this morning -- it's 8:30 -- and I have to use the facilities, and somebody has pissed all over the toilet seat.  Who the hell does that at work?  If I find the guy, I'm gonna beat his ass, then make sure he's fired.  Unless it was Eddy.  I know he has issues.

      Anybody lay down cash for a computer recently?  I've gotta buy a laptop, and have only heard 50 million opinions about why I should/shouldn't buy practically every type imaginable, so be the 50,000,001st if you have any thoughts.  I'm leaning IBM T42 w/ Pentium M 1.8 GHz, 80GB HD and 1 GB of RAM.  That will set me back $2700, which seems like a little too much, but I'd also prefer that the machine is more than a paperweight after I get my degree.

      but did anyone else see that ESPN dropped David Aldridge to keep Screaming A. Smith?  And that ESPN had Kid Rock perform last night on Sportscenter?    I can't watch that crap anymore.  (Kid Rock didn't even have Pamela or anything with him).

      Will,  &nbsp; Kudos on putting this together (although I realize setting this up on blogger isn't particularly time intensive).&nbsp; I will browse my other blog and see if I can't come up with some nice additions to the technology here (the file share at table12h.net is an excellent way to share songs, files, etc).&nbsp; Just got in from Bali/Hong Kong this morning, so I'm currently enjoying 2:55 PM Sunday for the second time.&nbsp; Frankly, given this second chance on life I'll I'm using it for is laundry and uploading pictures, but since I am, enjoy this picture of the Ritz in Bali, and if possible, I may just feel your collective jealousy the next time I stop by cmeter.

      Did we ever determine if  crapulence  is a real word?&nbsp; Or were we too lazy to check, much in the same way we were too lazy to make a crapulence meter...or the phone wheel for that matter.

      So I figured that it might be worth a try stealing Bill and his high-school friends' idea of a group blog to keep in touch, post random musings, etc.  I've not yet tried to play around with formatting or anything, so if anyone has any suggestions, let me know.  Also bear in mind that I'm lazy, busy with work, and not especially tech savvy, so if someone else wants to take over the care and feeding of this thing, let me know and I will gladly hand over the keys.

         After some prompting from Will, I can't help but post something about my former roommate.  First, where the hell is he -- this blog has been going for a number of weeks now without his participation.  Second, who the hell did he send to my wedding, because from all the stories I've heard, that was not the same person I lived with for the four years following college.  I'd appreciate any stories from such event posted as comments if they are appropriate for a wider audience.

           We've been getting in a number of photos from the wedding of late, and I thought I'd share a few. I'll be putting more on the website once I get my computer (should be delivered in 2 weeks). If any of you have photos of the event I'd love to see them. If you could be so kind as to burn them to a cd and mail it out to me, I'd appreciate it.

       urlLink  urlLink http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/health/20040802-1129-fatactivism.html    I can say this, because I'm fat myself.   It is a disease.  You're going to die younger.  Nine times out of ten it is your fault.  You are a health care burden.  And yes, doctors are right.  You do take up more room on a plane.   If you don't like how other people treat you, lose some fricking weight.
