      After a few months had gone by, and the dead of winter was now upon us, it was time for my father to fire up the coal stove and generate a little heat for us old-school New Englanders. The reason for the coal stove was that Dad never believed in electric heat because it was too expensive so he hired a service to come deliver loads of coal about 2-3 times throughout the season. It was effective enough, I suppose. Dirty, because one would have to shovel coal into the stove and afterwards, remove the ashes left by the coal that had already burned, but still effective. My father's only rule was this: "Nobody shovels coal into the stove but me. If you're cold at night, take out another blanket from the closet and put it on." Needless to say, we spent many a cold night at Chez Loubier. But none so cold as the nights spent during that winter.  My mother had placed the candlesticks she got from that tag sale on the mantel above the coal stove. Sometimes she'd take them down to burn a candle or two, but mainly they were put there for the "ambiance," as Mom liked to say. I really don't think the ambiance she got was the kind of ambiance she intended to achieve. I think it started one night in December of '84. And it scared the hell out of us.

      So we get to this tag sale, and there's about 40 people walking through and around makeshift rows of shit left by the person who lives in the filthiest-looking house I think I've ever seen. The yard looked like it hadn't been mowed this century, the brown paint was flaking and peeling off of the front of the house. There was a maroon-colored car parked in the driveway (had to be a Datsun) and one next to it camping out on the grass (probably another Datsun). All around me I saw what to me looked like junk. A couch, an old bookcase, a rusty table with four equally rusty chairs, picture frames, a lava lamp (if you can believe that). There was some old pottery pieces that looked as if they had to be from the early 1900s. But in the end, it was the silver candlesticks that caught Mom's eyes. Not too much longer after we had gotten there, my mother spotted two identical candlesticks. Very antique. She was in to that kind of stuff. She liked the whole old-fashioned, rustic look about certain things. She was in the middle of a very intense examination of said candlesticks when the old woman walked over.  "You like them?" she asked. My mother was a bit easy to startle so the question made her jump a little. The old lady was short and walked with a cane. Her shoes looked like the kind you wear when you're in a hospital and her dress resembled those smocks you used to wear in 5th grade art class. Those smocks sucked. I hated those friggen things.  "They're beautiful," Mom replied. "Are they old?" "Let's just say I got them when I was about your age." She spoke very slowly, almost with a natural stutter, but one could tell it was because of her age. She didn't wear any glasses which I thought was weird because I just assumed that all old people wore glasses to help them see. All I can remember thinking is maybe this old bag had some kind of Superman eyesight. My father and I poked around at some other junk. Dad was basically trying to appear as if he was really looking around for something while I was busy trying to find out if there were any G.I. Joe's in this pile of garbage.  "There's no price on them, are they free?" Mom laughed as she asked this. Always the packrat, trying to snag a freebie. The old lady, however, who seemed pleasant from the beginning, did not find this funny. "Oh, I must have missed those," the old lady said. She reached out slowly and took one of the candlesticks from my mother's hands and held it in her own. She stared at it for a few seconds as if waiting for the price to slap her in the face. But to my disappointment (and my father's), there was no magical force leaping at her face and slapping the old lady in the mug. Not on this day at least.  "Give me three dollars and you can take 'em," the lady said after a while. Mom reached into her purse and pulled out a five dollar bill and handed it to the old woman. Again, my mother attempted to make nice with the lady. "Take the whole five," my mother said with a smile, and the old lady, indifferent in response to this gesture, turned and slowly walked away. Perhaps toward wherever she was keeping the loot she made off this tag sale. Meanwhile, my mother turned with a what-did-I-do look on her face and motioned to my father to let him know "we're leaving now."  That was about all the time we spent at the old lady's tag sale. How odd, I thought, that she did not have an old man accompanying her at her home? In fact, I didn't see anyone there who looked like they were helping her sell her old junk. Maybe her husband passed away some time ago. The thought left my mind about as quickly as we made it to the interstate.  It was a long ride home on I-91 as I felt we had accomplished nothing (no G.I. Joe's, no video games), but my mother was happy with her candlesticks so I suppose one could say "mission accomplished." She had no idea how soon she'd be getting rid of them.

      It was really just an ordinary October day. The leaves were changing (actually they had already changed, now they were falling), the grass stopped growing for the year and browning in some spots, and from the highway, as I watched from the backseat of my Dad's old Mercury Cougar, all the houses in the town below had wisps of smoke coming from the chimneys. It reminded me of a valley full of candles that had just been blown out.  It was 1984, and I was tagging along with Ma and Pa Dukes for the day (had no choice, I was 5 years old). Apparently, someone out in Greenfield, Massachusetts was foolish enough to have a tag sale (or a yard sale, or a rummage sale, depending on what part of this lovely country you're from) on this brisk Saturday morning in October. So naturally, it's my mother's job to drag her husband and youngest son off through the wilderness to pick through someone else's crap just in case there's something of value to her.  Mom was a bit of a talker as well. She'd chew my Dad's ear off the entire day and he would just turn his head and smile then and again just to show her he was listening. Now and then he would throw out the occasional, "hmm," or "oh yeah?" but for the most part, he'd pretty much stare straight ahead and watch the road in front move toward him at a steady 55 mph clip. Someone once said my mother could talk a dog off of a meat wagon. I didn't understand what that meant (again, I was five).  From the backseat, in between battles with Shredder and the Ninja Turtles, all I could offer was the frequent, "how much longer?" "Ten more minutes," my mother would say. Mom was infamous for replying with "ten more minutes." Ever notice how every time you asked your parents how much longer, it was always "ten more minutes?" It didn't really matter where you were going. You could have been 2 hours from the destination, but it didn't matter. I think every time I was told "ten more minutes" it had already been twenty minutes from the last time I'd asked.  About 45 minutes later, we arrived at the tag sale.

       I can't remember how many times I've been told this story. I used to think it was to keep my brothers and I from staying up late at night after my parents went to bed so we could watch old Family Ties reruns or soft-core porn on HBO. But you know how you start to believe things after you've heard them spoken of after so many times? Well, that's why I believe this story. That and the fact that I'm a grown man now and my parents still swear that the following events did indeed happen. After all, they never gave me a reason not to believe them. And I never gave them a reason to tell stories. None like this...
