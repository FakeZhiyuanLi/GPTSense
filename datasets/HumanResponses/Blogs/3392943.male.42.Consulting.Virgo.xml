      I've been tweaking the blog template today. I'm a newbie @ css, so if anyone sees anything that looks bad, let me know. :-)  Got my booth set up at the flea market today (Fri.), I will be set up and selling first thing tomorrow morning. I hope to get some digital pics of my booth to post here to show others how to sell for themselves.  I'm planning on having some professionally made banners/signs made to hang from my outdoor canopy. The sign shop said it should take a few days. I am getting one that is white on black with silver 'bling' accents saying "jewelry watches necklaces sunglasses" and another square one with the store name "Paddywhack Nicknacks" (goofy play on words, eh?) I'm also thinking of getting a vertical banner with prices, but I'm not sure yet because my prices can fluctuate depending on sales.  That's all for now... here are some more helpful links:   China Sources Online  -  urlLink http://www.chinasources.com.tw/    DIRECTORY OF DROPSHIP WHOLESALE SUPPLIERS  -  urlLink http://www.cashwonders.com/dropshipwholesale.html     Google Directory Listing  -  urlLink General Merchandise    Wholesale 411  -  urlLink http://www.wholesale411.com/  Be sure and check out the forums too!

      The UPS guy came early today. I got my shipment of watches today. I got 'bling bling', jacob, movado, rolex, and metal styles. These are GREAT movers. I can't wait to start selling them. I usually mark them up only 100%. I plan on plowing all my profits back into more stock. Eventually I'll start selling these wholesale myself.

      Welcome all! I've been wanting to get into this whole 'blogger' thing for a while, but I've been so busy with starting/running my small business that I just got around to it now.  Another reason I started this is my formerly successful website located at http://home.fuse.net/ccg/smallbizlinks.html was deleted by my 'great' ISP... FUSE, here in Cincinnati. (Can you tell I'm mad? :-))  A few months ago FUSE screwed up my internet service and deleted my account. I lost about a month's worth of email and evidently they deleted my 'ccg' subfolder, thus deleting my WHOLE small business related website. Aarrgghh!!! I was getting anywhere between 500-1000 hits a month. I wrote a scathing email to tech support. Luckily, I had all my pages backed up!  I have a dedicated domain located @  urlLink www.small-biz-links.com  , but it is still under construction. Please ignore the mess, it is a 'yahoo' style listing page in perl. I had someone install the code and I'm not real familiar with it. I'm still experimenting. BTW - the site I got the code from is  urlLink www.gossamer-threads.com  . It's called 'links sql'... really a kewl piece of work! I highly recommend them. I hope to get the full pro version installed in the near future.  Speaking of my former site, I will see about moving or recreating my deleted site at my permanent domain asap.  WELL! Enough griping, let me get on to what I *really* created this blog for... SMALL BUSINESS!  I have collected many bookmarks over the years related to small business, advertising, marketing, wholesale sources, tips, tricks, etc... I started my website as a collection of my favorite links, and it grew to a full blown site. I will post some useful links here, as well as juicy business related tips in the hope that others will help this grow.  I was laid off from the IT industry and started selling at a local flea market to make ends meet. I researched on the internet and in the alt.wholesale newsgroup and found some great and not-so-great websites and sources. I started out selling fantasy related jewelry and figurines. I actually did quite well in between IT contracts. I made about $400 bucks my first weekend! It was a mixture of SMC stuff and items I found wholesale.  I've moved on from SMC (their shipping costs are just stupid), and I've found various wholesale sources. Here's my first set of links that are REALLY helpful to me:   Figurines  - Opportunity Buys  urlLink http://www.obiwholesale.com/  GREAT general merchandise wholesaler. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!   Jewelry  - Junior Sense  urlLink http://www.jrsense.com/  AWESOME jewelry mfg out of New York. Great selling stuff!   Watches  - Anytime Watch  urlLink http://www.anytimewholesale.com/  Fast moving sellers. Ask for Mike, Say Chris @ CCG Sales sent you.  These are all great moving items for me at the flea market and I'm sure they would move in retail, mall, ebay, or similar. This summer my hot items are 'bling bling' style jewelry and watches, 'industrial' style teen fashion necklaces, sunglasses and small figurines. A few years ago the 'indy' necklaces were flying off the table, but now it seems the 'bling' is hot. I had 30 watches in stock last weekend and sold them all! The sunglasses I got a sweet deal on for a mixed lot of 100 for $100. I sell them $2 each or 2 for $3. These sell great also.  Oh well, enough for now. It's late and I've got a new shipment of watches coming tomorrow... :-) I'll try to update as much as possible. I'll put this blog in my sigfile and see what happens!

      Yep. That says it all... wholesale sources are hard to find. All the really good ones are strictly 'word-of-mouth'. I probably search 2-3 hours a day on the internet, and I'm lucky to find 1 good source a day.  Lately I've been trying smaller or specialized search engines and odd word search combinations. Example: instead of "watches+wholesale" I tried "wholesale+chinatown" and got some surprising results. It just dawned on me one day that LA and NY both have a 'Chinatown' area, and importers/wholesalers might be there. I found a few leads and if I find anything good, I'll post it here.  I found a new source for Geneva style watches. It looks pretty good, with only a $300 minimum. I've spoken with a few of my usual sources and they all say you really have to visit NY or LA in person and scour the wholesale districts in person. Also, a trip to one of the big 'shows' in Las Vegas or NY will reveal more sources than you can throw a stick at.  If my sales projections keep a good pace, I may have enough saved up to take a road trip to Vegas in August for the big shows. (fingers crossed)  TTFN... here's some more goodies:    Los Angeles Chinese Chamber of Commerce   urlLink http://www.lachinesechamber.org/    NY + Chinatown + watches yahoo search results   urlLink Yahoo search results click here    Jewelry Industry News   urlLink http://www.topix.net/business/jewelry

      I've been busy doing research and trying to find more wholesale sources. I didn't sell at the flea market this weekend. I felt a little lazy, and it was too hot and humid anyway.  I've also been trying to redo the blog template with little success. I'm trying to add my 'smallbizlinks webring' code unsuccessfully. My old site (before FUSE messed it up) had a javascript navbar supplied by http://www.webring.org It is pretty cool, actually. But for some reason the blog template won't let me add the code. I'm still trying! :-)  Anyhoo... I've been waiting to order new merchandise, in preparation for Father's Day next weekend. I *may* get some of the proverbial 'father's day ties' to use as an upsell or backend added value for my good old mainstay, watches. Speaking of which, more new watches due sometime in the next few days.  I now specialize in watches, sunglasses (another order coming this week), necklaces, and new this week are 'cooling bandannas'!  These things are really neat! They really work too! I got a sample from the mfg... they are a sewn bandana filled with some absorbant material that 'plumps' and absorbs 1000 times it's weight in water. You soak them in cool water for 1/2 hour and then tie it around your neck. It cools by evaporation. It really works! I've got a bulk pack and a display unit coming this week as well. I'm going to set up a cooler of water and a display sign, and sell them for $3 each or 2 for $5. I think they'll sell well in this hot, humid Ohio summer weather.  Enough for now... Here's some interesting links:   T-shirts   urlLink http://www.wholesalecentral.com/tshirtdistribution/store.cfm    Ties   urlLink http://www.wildties.com/     Free Business Cards!   urlLink http://www.vistaprint.com  (look for link on left)  Have a  GREAT DAY !

      Hey all,  I've been busy  and  lazy since my last post. I've only sold at the flea market 2 times. The weather has been *so* hot and humid. I may get an indoor booth space just for the air conditioning. Unfortunately, sales in the summer months are slower inside, so I'm weighing comfort vs sales.  Also, since last time I've gotten some new sources, one of which was disappointing. I got supposed 'geneva style' watches from some company out of Los Angeles. (I'm not going to name them) Their website *clearly* describes the watches as 'geneva'. Well, I ordered nearly $300 worth. Granted, I got GREAT prices on them, but they were NOT 'geneva'!! They were brands like 'Beverly Hills' and 'Fred Belay' etc... also, I got the WRONG type of 'bling-bling' style watches as well!  They sold ok... not as good as my usual watches, but they *were* less to buy wholesale. All in all, I think I'll go back to getting my best sellers ('Paul Jardin' style) From Anytime Wholesale in PA, and my 'Geneva' style (bling-bling) from Watches LLC out of Texas. It may cost a little more wholesale, but these are consistently better sellers for me.  My cooling bandanas sold really well also. I ordered another case last week. The hot, sunny weather really helps sell my sunglasses and cooling bandanas.  I'm still looking for deals on sunglasses (case lots). I found a company with GREAT prices (.50 per) but I have to buy in lots of 1000 or more! I'm gonna see if someone at the flea market wants to go in 'halveses' on one of these big cases. I could sell them $1 per pair and still make 100% profit!  Well, enough for today... here are a few interesting links for you:   urlLink  80s Tees   GREAT T-shirts! Ask for Kevin, he offers discounts for bulk purchases.    urlLink US Census Bureau   Need some business stats for your business? Try here!    urlLink Prepaid Cellphones   Prepaid cellphones? Hot sellers? I may investigate this.
