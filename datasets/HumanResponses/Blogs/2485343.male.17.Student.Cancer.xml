      December the 23rd. One day before Christmas Eve, the day we celebrate Christmas. I thought I would be much more excited, but my brother says it is due to getting older. For god's sake, IM only 16! Anyway. I just thought I would update this. Some people start to complain if there isn't a post every freaking day. I've started writing in my paper journal again. I haven't written in that since the 29th I think. I've been listening to some new bands recently. They go as follows: Hot Rod Circuit - Sorry About Tomorrow, .hopesfall. - The Satellite Years, Mae - Destination:Beautiful, Midtown - Living Well Is the Best Revenge. my favorite is Hot Rod Circuit. you should go pick up that CD, its tight hahaha.

       Butterflies and Nervous Feelings  Swirling lyrics Reminding me of Everything I’m missing Don’t think I’d mind Too much if it was You I could be kissing How lovely you’ll always Seem to me when Your eyes pour into mine Always I feel As if I’ll never Escape this twirling vine Can't I say what I feel? You wont let me inside why cant these feelings for you subside in my mind. these butterflies and nervous feelings have a hold on me without talking to you i'll probably never be free. tell what you feel inside i just want to know if there will be a time time that is left is rapidly diminishing for the light i give you might not be there again.  When I can Look into your eyes And see only what used to be, I know that what I felt for you is lost and will never come back to me. When my only memories of you Are reveries of pain and sorrow, I know now that you are gone and lonely days will follow. When I look at your picture on the wall With Confusion and uncertainty, I know that something went wrong With all that was meant for you and me. When all I can think about is how you left without a reason, And how you don't remember me now Is nothing like the season Of love we had and how I cant deal with what I have to Live with forever... Is this The End?

      I guess I should update this, huh. Well... I don't know what the hell is going on anymore. This always happens to me. I can never just pick one girl and stick. I know this sounds sorta pathetic that I'm writing about two girls that I like, but think of it this way: what would you do? K and T. I like K, she has been dormant for a while and I think she likes me, that's what her friends tell me. She is incredible. we are alike in a strange way. But T likes me A LOT. i dont know what to do. girls like me....girls dont like me, why dont they make up their mind.

      I feel so pathetic. Not really because I don't have anything to do, but because I feel like I am a really weak person when it comes to other people. I wish I could just not give a damn, and follow through with my courses of action. But I just can't. Well...there is still an opportunity. I mean the thing is... I don't need anyone in my life right now. Sure it's fucking nice to be able to like have relationships with people...But the problems with that is the fact that there is a lack of resources. Not a lack of people per se, but a lack of the kinds of people I would like to spend my time with. I refuse to go through social hoops to get to know someone, along with that I refuse to be forced to do that. So that is the main reason why I am here by myself still. I don't understand a lot of people's reasons for doing things. In fact, I don't see where some people get off doing the things they do to me.

      This one is from The Great Divorce, by C. S. Lewis:  You cannot take all luggage with you on all journeys. On one journey, even your right hand and your right eye may be among the things you have to leave behind. We are not living in a world where all roads are radii of a circle and where all, if followed long enough, will therefore draw gradually nearer and finally meet at the centre; rather, in a world where every road, after a few miles, forks into two and each of those into two again and at each fork you must make a decision.... I do not think that all who choose wrong roads perish; but their rescue consists in being put back on the right road. I suppose all this has to do with choices.

      I am heaven sent. Don't you dare forget. I am all you've ever wanted. What all the other boys all promised. Sorry I told. I just needed you to know. I think in decimals and dollars. I am the cause to all your problems. Shelter from cold. We're never alone. Coordinate brain and mouth. Then ask me what it's like to have myself so figured out. I wish I knew. I hope this song starts a craze. The kind of song that ignites the airwaves. The kind of song that makes people glad to be where they are with who ever they're there with. This is war. Every line is about who I don't wanna write about anymore. I hope you come down with something they can't diagnose, don't have the cure for. Holding on to your grudge. It's so hard to have someone to love. Keeping quiet is hard. Cause you can't keep a secret if it never was a secret to start. At least pretend you didn't want to get caught. - Brand New 'Okay I Believe You, But My Tommy Gun Don't'

      I don't know. I think that starting this was sort of weird. I have been sitting here for about thirty minutes and I really don't know where to start, where to begin. To tell you the truth, I think I should start here. Now. I like  Her , I like  Her  a lot and I don't know what to do about it. I cant ask  Her  for I don't know if she likes me, or if she still does. I don't know what to do. I remember the first time we kissed. So surreal in my mind as though I could go back to that day when the snow fell, when it was "snowing in the car." My eyes were on her from the moment she walked out of the house. The roads were starting to get bad and if we didn't leave then, we wouldn't have gone. If you would have told me at that time that something was going to happen between  Her  and I, I would've laughed in your face. The plan was to make cookies, although it never happened we still had fun. We found a way to entertain ourselves with a little soccerball in a "hot potato" esque game. Somehow we ended up on the futon mattress on the floor. all lying there creating small talk and enjoying each others company. The other two were talking amongst themselves as She and I talked. At first it was awkward, for talking to someone new was weird in itself. The Hair-tie....A segway to holding hands. But the thing I remember most about that was not the kiss itself, but the way she looked into my eyes, the way she traced the outline of my jaw with her fingers and the moment before the kiss, which I believe is greater than the kiss. I know you are going to read this and I know what you are thinking, this isn't a ploy to get you back. I just want you to know how I feel. How I felt. I'll be back.

      I think that today has been a day of reflections on my part. I want to have a conversation with a girl I had a relationship with, but I cant bring myself to say anything to her. Just a meager 'hi' in the hallways. I find myself to be mercifully weak when it comes to girls, I love them and have so much respect for them, they just scare me to the point where I feel a fear of rejection. Maybe im just not one for the ladies, you know what I mean? Maybe if I were to sit down with her, I can actually connect with her deeper than I have been able to in the past. I liked her so much, and I have to admit, I still do. I cant let her go for some reason, I have been able to let go of a lot of girls in the past, but I cant let her go. I don't want to let her go, and that is the problem. It hurt me so badly, my metaphorical wall has been broken for the first time and I cant pick up the pieces, they are destroyed beyond recognition. I yearn to feel the touch of her hand in mine, I want to feel her lips on mine again. I want for her to look in my eyes again and see her smile and kiss me, I want to see the smile on her face when I look into her eyes. I still smell her watermelon lipgloss she had on when I first kissed her, her first kiss, my first real kiss. I cherish that. I want to go back to the day at cacey's house. The day where she looked so beautiful, the day we kissed for the first time, I want her to go back with me, I can relive that day in my mind over and over again, so surreal. I want to feel her in my arms again. I want to make the ceilings look like floors, I want to talk about the striped hair-tie. 'is it yellow with black stripes?' maybe I would like her to tell me why she left. Why she cant be with me now, why she couldn't make us work. Most of all, I just want her to look me in the eyes again.

      Don't you like it when people stereotype? You wear, listen, do one thing and you're are automatically a genre of person(s). It is seriously ridiculous, especially when the person doesn't know you. Oh, but they think they know you. They are for sure about that. As you can tell, I have a low tolerance for ignorance.  Well...I have been reading several books recently and I'd have to say that I haven't been so engulfed in a book before like I have been this one. The book is called "Breathing Underwater" by Alex Flinn, and i suggest you go pick it up. It is a very good read.

      I can't take it, if you're waiting. I am ready to tell the world about a girl who showed me love again for the first time. And it's everything I dreamed of.  I cant stop thinking with my heart when it comes to things like love and relationships. I am reading a book. Three to be exact. There is a passage in one of them that says, 'you can always find the one in the crowd that can fulfill your needs, but you will never be able to pick out the one that will be perfect for you.'  Maybe I should move on. It is hard for me to sit here and think of a girl that I liked so much for me only to think her away. Maybe in live you are only allowed one chance at love. If you mess up, that's it for you. I have messed up once, before her. If that was my chance, it wasn't my fault. She was the one who led me on consistently and played with my heart as it were an egg. One false move and its over for the young boys heart. 'I have his whole world in my hands' she sang as she stomped on it. Lindsey Alexander broke my heart, Anna also broke it. I cant trust anybody anymore.  And the plaster dented from your fist in the hall where you had your first kiss reminds you that the memories will fade.

      I have a feeling, a feeling that won't go away. a feeling that if acted upon can bring great rewards and great disaster. i have had this feeling for so long and yet so little people have yet to share it with me.  again i attempt to lay my life out on this computer for the viewing audience to understand what my life is all about.  i have started again at my normal high school, thornton for those of you just tuning in,  and it is the beginnig of the day. third hour i see her, i wave, she looks and continues to walk. i avoid her the rest of the day. i havent gotten used to seeing her. seeing her is like meeting her for the first time, you are always amazed by her beauty and grace. i havent had the honor of talking to her yet, i hope i can face my fear of rejection and just talk to her. she can only say no, right? enough about her though, i am starting to grasp the fact that she isnt coming back.  the first day of classes as well as the second were suprisingly easy. i still feel underchallenged. a good brain gone to waste in another public school.

      Excerpt from the paper journal: December 22nd  I'm not sure about what I want... thats what she told me.. the dagger through the heart. it was a cold day, that day when she decided she didnt want me a part of her life. the truth hurts. i put on a face that no one could recognize. a face where i didnt recognize myself. for the first time in my life i was emotionless. a hard shell protected me while i withdrew. i havent spoke to her since. Everything was going well, better than expected....Life is full of 'What If's' after you lose something you really care for.

                  The boy watches as the day slowly dies away and the night begins to breathe its cold air. he is off, destination:Unknown. The boy receives a phone call, the one who has broken his heart calls for a rebound guy, not now. The boy hangs up the phone and thinks to himself 'don't let her break you again.' he reminisces on the moment of lust and of passion he felt for the girl. It has all turned to resentment. The girl they call Lindsey had walked into his life only to destroy it. he hates her for it. She made an honest boy, a boy who treats girls with the upmost respect, she made him cheat on a girl who had strong feelings for. The night, still young. The trust he has left for her, none.             He continues his journey to the city of Broomfield, a place where no one knows his name. he meets up with a girl who he had feelings for but never had the courage to tell her so. She looks like a movie-star. She takes his breath away. They go to see a motion picture. Nothing eventful happens because he is nervous, he is self-conscious, he knows nothing. The boy heads for home, kicking himself for missed opportunity. The song about the best night of his life plays. he parks the car and heads for the door. The boy is back to where he started. The girl named Lindsey calls him. he hangs up and enters his house.

      I never thought I would be this sad leaving this place. I never thought anybody would care or stop me , but I have seen the disappointment in the faces on many of the teachers faces. Many of the students here who have come to know me are also disappointed. I see it as leaving the hand that helped me up, eventually you have to continue down the sidewalk. While being here I have discovered myself by being myself. I know now that the only reason I was here in the first place was because of myself and the things I have done. 'honor the truth, then fix yourself.' all I can say about that is, Mission Accomplished. I would've never guessed that I would leave here with the possibility of graduating on time. Hard work and determination have paid off but to say I wont succeed is a mockery to this school. 'a mans success is determined by the obstacles he has overcome.' Today closes a chapter in my life story. It also starts the rest of My Life.

      Newton's Third Law states: Every action has a Reaction. For example, if I were to bounce a ball on the ground the ball will push down and the earth will pull the ball down. I've wondered if this happens in life with the people we meet and the relationships we are in. Say you and this guy/girl are dating you move slowly toward each other until you meet in the middle. Once you meet, do you bounce off eachother and move away? Are we all destined to be alone with the theory of Newton's Third Law? If it does, then I would like to go really slow with the people I know and like, I don't want to bounce off each other in a elastic collision. Just a thought...

      I've been thinking throughout high school and college we meet so many people and have so many friends and many people think that oh YEAH they're going to be friends forever. After a while you realize that most of these people are your friend not because they particularly like you, but because you met at a few parties and exchanged phone numbers once. Then when you're out of college, whether bridges are burned or people are simply forgotten, eventually you're left with mostly one type of friend. They're the ones that even though you don't call for a month, when you DO call they're just so excited to hear from you and can't wait to get together again. Those are the great friends. They don't hold grudges, they aren't angry, they don't bring you down. When i think of the people i know, i only know of two, maybe three people like that. Thank You

      The girl of my dreams walked by today. But I didn't tell her Hi. I just glared at her Amazed by the reality of someone being so perfect in every aspect of the meaning.  She walked by walked with her back turned and I kept staring willing myself to follow yet forcing myself to stay  I kicked myself on the inside for the mistake id just made it just didn't seem real to me that I had missed out on this opportunity  I watched the girl of my dreams pass by today she looked - then turned away

      Today I realized something. As much as I would like to get back with  Her , I'll probably never get to be. Today I stood there. I watched her pass me by, like I was nothing. I feel some sort of heartbreak everyday, a pain that is so intense that I feel like breaking down. Not going on. I want her to read this, but I am also scared to the fact that she might interpret this in another way than it is meant. It is meant to tell you  that I still like you, I still want to be friends, but I don't want to force you to do anything you don't want. I just wanted you to know how i felt.

      Today I am faced with a great challenge, a choice I have to make. It decides my future ultimately and I don't know what to do. I am a failure. To my mom, to my family, to me. I'm in a predicament whereas if I go back to Thornton High School, I would be faced with a overload of work. Taking me from first hour to ninth hour, no lunch. Whereas if I stay here at Vantage Point, I would escape with 14 credits and be a regular senior next year. It is hard for me to decide right now because I'm not looking at this from a student perspective, for if I was I would no doubtedly stay here. I am looking at through a social aspect. I want to go back and be with my friends at Thornton, I want to experience the night life once again, the taste of being liked is all to real. It would b too hard though. I need some advice, tag my board. I need it.

      Today didn't seem to be that bad of a day. I had Poetry and newspaper, I also had Computer Concepts where I made that nifty bio page (shameless plug). Anyway, after school I went to Thornton and I saw  her  I was to afraid to talk to  her .  I don't think she saw me, im such a loser. I really cant put my finger on it, but there is something that gets me about her. Where when I think of anything, she is apart of it. I was looking at the ceilings the other day and it reminded me about her. Ceilings as Floors. I remember that from that Saturday. And whenever I smell something, it reminds me of her. Like her watermelon lipgloss. I cant get her out of my head. Its unbearable, the worst part about it is I cant talk to her. I want to really badly but peers say not to. 'if she wants to talk to you, she will come to you.' but what if she wants ME to talk to HER??? Does anyone think of another scenarios other then the obvious? But I guess I sit here and wait. By the way, ivy been waiting for a month now. Just thought you'd want to know. It reminds me of a song by HotRod Circuit, 'At Natures's Mercy.' It goes a little something like this:  Hard not to get hooked  Hooked on you  Hard not to get hooked  Hooked on you   Think of all the trouble that we get into  Whenever I'm around you  Nothing that I can do  All the secrets and mistakes, yeah, that were made  What else do I have to say?  I hate being without you   Never gonna leave your side  Cause I can't resist the crazy things you do  It's gonna take a lot of your time  And I hope someday I can give it back to you   Hard not to get hooked  Hooked on you  Hard not to get hooked  Hooked on you   Think of all the trouble that we get into  Whenever I'm around you  Nothing I can do  All the secrets and mistakes that were made  What do I have to say?  I hate being without you  I love that song. go pick it up. anyway, i'm out. i'll write something tonight, if not, tomorrow.

      The Broncos lost...What a shame that a game with no relevance to me or anyone besides the players, getting their $100,000 checks, affects us in such a manner. People these days (including myself). I'm in school right now, I hate it with a passion. Oh well, I don't know, if its my only way out of Colorado then I have to do it. Sure I want to go to college out of state, but I don't think I would be able to handle living in another state and being responsible, but I guess its a rite of passage. Good day, I'll be back later with updates on this day that is ultimately going to become a bad one.

      this is the story of your red right ankle and how it came to meet your leg and how the muscle, bone and sinews tangled and how the skin was softly shed and how it whispered 'oh, adhere to me for we are bound by symmetry and whatever differences our lives have been we together make a limb'  this is the story of your red right ankle  -Jesse Lacey   My heart is a paper cut-out and your scissors are dull and rusted over with a careless disposition. You snip away slowly, unknowingly tearing me apart. It's taken awhile but you are finaly reaching the end of the line. Snip by snip you barely cut through me, leaving a loveless residue on the poorly trimmed sides. I wish the scissors were sharper so they could slice right through without problem, leaving no trace of the offense. But no, your blades barely slide through me, and they leave the biggest pain of all.

      The clock strikes twelve, and im alone. Happy New Year, yours was probably better than mine. I once heard of a superstition, the way you spend new years is the way you will spend the rest of the year. I hope im not alone the rest of the year. I don't know, should I change things to make people like me? Or should I stay the way I am and hope everyday that someone will like me for who I am. The problem is, I really don't know who I am anymore. I think that if you were to look at the way I have been my whole life, you could probably tell I have been playing follow-the-leader for quite a while. I think now though I have found a piece of who I am. I am too suppressed by the people around me, I make changes to fit different people. For instance; my 'friends' at school know me to be a goofy, dumb, quirky sort of person. When really I like to talk, like to listen, I like to be around people like me, like the IB kids. I can relate to them more than another. I just have trouble fitting in there because they have such a tight knit group that has been around each other since middle school and before. I want to be friends with more intellectual people, instead of the popular kids i used to be friends with, or still am. i dont know...im going to bed. Happy New Year.

       I'm having one of those days where I just feel idle. I can't get anything done, nor start anything. I feel rather pathetic and useless. Not even a person to talk to, I have. This must be the kind of boredom that the dead feel. I need to get out, to do something. Maybe I will run. Yeah that's it, run just run my ass off. Perspire this feeling away. That's it.   urlLink Charlie   I guess you can say that I have had this feeling for more than two years now. I run, but metaphorically. I cant escape what is consuming me everyday, I guess this is what happens when you have nothing to look forward to but work or school.   Baseball starts tomorrow and I'm so excited, I cant wait to do something. I golf every second of the day when I can and now this will consume me and drive me to do well in school. Its gonna be great.  I also think about the time that is left in the school year. My brother is attending his last ever pitching lesson with the great Wayne Doland. He is sad about it, I think he is gonna miss it very badly. He lives baseball all year 'round. Spring and summer is actual baseball playing. Fall and winter is off season training and pitching clinics and hitting clinics. I don't know what he is gonna do. I think he will sleep all too much. Last year in September was the first time he has slept in on a Saturday. He hasn't since his freshmen year.  KD is the coolest person you will ever talk to. I will give her a shout out right now. I have hopes.

      i think that today showed me something that cant be learned nor taught. i think love now is the most important thing in life, im not just talking about a relation ship between two people, but the love you get from your family and friends. i think back on days and i know now that the relationships that i have been in have been over-dramatized in the stupid high school way. i think it is important to feel some sort of love in high school but not love for the rest of your life. by finding love early on through relationships in school, i think you become more aware of the opposite sex and the things they do. you can figure the out more easily. i know im not the only person who has had a better relationship by being friends with the person you used to 'love' then when you were going out. i know that if you find that person you swear is the love of your life, dont take it too seriously unless you are willing to pack up and leave for that person. believe me when i say that i have countless crushes and countless errors in my life with girls, i attribute that to my lack of confidence and self esteem, im not saying im depressed or a suicidal maniac if i dont have a relationship, but when these holidays come around, it makes you feel more and more like a failure at this game. you either have no one to share it with or you have someone you care about truly. i dont know what im trying to say here. all i know is that i want love, but i dont need it. i want a girl, but i dont need her. i just want to care.  in other news....  ive been thinking of people i have been in relationships and i would like to apologize to them if i have done anything to them. i know that none of you read this, but i think that if i get it out in some way i will feel a little better.  maybe i know that i will probably never have any relationship with any of you again. im sorry.

      I went to a restaurant in North Denver today. I was observing this father and his son. It looked as though he was an only parent and that he and his son got along well. I thought to myself, 'it must be hard to be a single dad.' he was feeding his boy, the boy looked as though he would be about four or five. The kid said to his dad, 'daddy? When is mommy coming back from vacation?' the dad tried to think of something fast. He told the boy, 'she isn't coming back son. She left me and you here so we can find her later on.' I didn't get what he meant at first but the guy was trying to say that the wife either passed away or that she had left with another guy. I felt for this kid, my mom had to tell this to me also. She told me that my dad was gone for a while and that I would see him but he wouldn't come home. It must be hard to be a single parent. I also had another observation. At this girls house I went to tonight, I saw three girls. We arrived at this girls house, all 6 of us, and we were escorted to the basement. The girls could've had their pick of any of the guys in the room, I know because they were all single. These girls set it up strategically to talk to different guys. I don't think it was that obvious to the simple male mind, but I can see through girls that I know I cant have. These girls have worked this before and had another group of guys coming after our group had its 'time limit.' I find it funny to watch them implement a game plan.

       Quote:                   Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who                find it easier to luve in the world they've been given than to explore                the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. It's an                opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It's a dare. Impossible is                 potential. Impossible is temporary.                 Impossible is nothing.

      By the way, why is everyone complaining about Valentines Day? Come one guys and girls, if you are so bugged by it then go get off the computer and get a date, its your fault you are alone. i know what you are saying, its easy for you because you have someone. in all reality, i dont. i know how it is to go through this day alone, it should bother you. i just get pissed by the fact that all these people wont get off their asses to go mingle with other singles.  im bored, im going to get another Sunshine Smoothie.

      Oh how my eyes are so intrigued to see you. We sit here, hurry up and wait. the fates of our demise in this, the romanticies that two can feel in  an hour of death. death in a part of you death in a part of me  the light with a dim soft glow penetrates the dark or what isn't there. My hands amuse their way across your hands and keep you from falling apart. Maybe I wasn't meant for this maybe you were meant for me. We forget anything and everything as the clocks tick the time away you wont leave me you're a sucker for anything acoustic

      i would like to extend a point to people that know me. i'm not all that i am, im not a liar, im not cool, im not who i would like to be. if there was some way to put it into words then i would, but for now i cant. i want to fall in love. i watched a walk to remember last night and i want to love someone to the same extent. maybe i will never have the opportunity to do so, but its something that i would like to work for. not neccessarily work, but let happen. girls are now on the back burner. i am reading poems by Saul Williams. the man is my hero. Chris Carrabba is my hero, Johnny Cash, Elvis. i reflect on this past week and i see nothing, literally. someone once told me, 'if you look back on your week and see nothing, there is something wrong with the way you conducted yourself that week.' i need to challenge myself. baseball is coming up, maybe that will help me in my school work, or lack there of. i am sort of happy for my brother. he lives baseball. im also proud of him for getting his ticket out, as he told me in 7th grade. im going to miss him. he has been such an influence in my life. maybe someday i can tell him how proud i am of him. he has his pick of colleges. heroes: Saul Williams, Jessie Lacey, Chris Carrabba, Johnny Cash, Elvis, Phillip Silva.

      Anything new? i have nothing to say, today is going the same as anyother day, boring and under challenging. i tried making assignments in my classes more exciting, but how can you make school more exciting? its just going to be an issue with me, i cant fall back into my same old ways. i get too bored and i dont want to go to the classes im in due to that fact. i wish there was more incentive than a diploma, like money or something. god knows i need it, im not going to be able to get into college without it. i am paranoid about writing in this at school. teens are too nosey. i want to tell the girl next to me to mind her own buisness but im not that rude.

      a single tear falls down my cheek, the tear represents a life that could have happened, it also represents the girl who just broke my heart. she ran me over with a mack truck, she backed up to make sure i wasnt ever going to get up. the tear also represents me letting go.  Hope you wonder where I sleep at night Cause I feel like I'm inside out You got me upside down Maybe I was holding on too tight

      love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with? I say fall head over heels. Find someone you love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. And how do you find this person? Forget your head and listen to your heart...Run the risk. If you get hurt, you'll come back. Because the truth is, there is no sense living your life without this. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love---well, you haven't lived life at all. You have to try. Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived...

        suspended like spirits over speeding cars    Jeremey, 17 and alive. This summer has been somewhat of a disaster. I guess its another story of teenage love gone wrong and life going by too fast. Another teen spilling his story and heart onto a blog looking for insight and pity. Maybe I need some, maybe I'm just bored. The life of irresponsibility is slipping me and I don't want to grow up.  I had a rude awakening this summer and its something you never want to hear about in your profession. I thought to myself that I had a lot of power in this job, whether or not I realize it, I do. It scares me. I haven't been out much this summer, the people I really want to hangout with have been the people out on vacations or not answering my calls. It doesn't bother me that much, it gives me more time with my guitar and a clear sky. speaking of my guitar, if you play one or need another player or just want me to entertain you, call me. I'm bored, I'm going to sleep.

      this week has been fun, ive made an attempt to be out every night this week and have been successful. i met someone while out with my friend Courtnee, her name is Michelle and i think she is cute. it sometimes sucks because the times when i think someone likes me back, they dont and thats what i found out with her. i will live. i have also been to the golf course every single day from 7-11 am and i have been loving every single moment of it. i couldnt see myself not playing golf. im in a band now too, we're in the building stages now, but i cant seem to put my guitar down either. even when my hands are raw and sore from golf, i pick it up and just play. i cant wait to just make music, it gives me chills to think about what i could do with it. i love to play the guitar and i love to sing when i do, i just dont want to be the lead singer. for the first time in my life right now, i have found my friends. TCox, Bianca, Juice, Courtnee, Anna and Alyssa. i bet you wish you had friends like these, bitches.
