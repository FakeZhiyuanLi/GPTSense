      Firstly, thanks to Black Lotus for his input.   THE RACE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE:   This was certainly one of the weirdest races in recent years.  We start the race with Panis stalling his car, before he gets into position. This results in a restart. Finally, we get back into position, and the race begins again. Panis stalls his car for a second time, but the team manages to get the car into the pit lane, and he subsequently starts from there. During the second start, Sato manages to fly off the line (which some say was before the lights went out...) and clips Schumi, forcing the Red Dragon back into 5th place. Klien puts himself out of the race at Loews. (Which is odd, with it being the slowest corner in Formula 1 .... This leaves 19 on the track) The first few laps are relatively uneventful, with Renault in position 1 and 2. (Yes.....) There's some weird smoke coming out of the back of Sato's Honda, but they think it's just an overfill of oil. In lap 3, Sato's car gives up all hope, and a burst of smoke bellows out of the rear, covering the entire track and bringing the race to a near stand-still. Sato is out. (Leaving 18 on the track) To clear the smoke, Fisichella decides to use Coulthard's McLaren as a ramp and succeeds .... in landing upside down against the barrier. Fisichella and Coulthard are out of the race. (Leaving 16 in the race) The next 2 and a half laps are under the safety car.  The race is fairly uneventful until lap 13, when Webber rolls to a stop. (This leaves 15) Lap 15 ... Pantano has an oddly long pit-stop, only to come out and have his car blow up on him. (This drops us to 14 on the track) Bruni pits in lap 19 and doesn't come back out again. (This leaves us with 13). Raikkonen pits for a long time in lap 30. Pulls away, but then seems to change his mind, and retires instead. (We now have 12 on the track, people) Lap 43 comes along and Alonso decides to use his Renault to clean the wall on the exit of the tunnel. (Dammit, Alonso....) He fails hopelessly in his cleaning efforts, but succeeds in giving Ralph the finger while his car is still spinning. (That's my boy...) (We now have 11 on the track) Safety car ..... again. Everybody decides to pit ... except for Ferrari. (Oh, that's smart...) Lap 46. Safety car is still out. Schumi is in P1.  They go through the tunnel. Schumi decides that Alonso didn't do a good enough cleaning job inside the tunnel, so decides to lend a helping hand. (Or a helping left-front tire...) That puts the world champ out. (leaving us with 10) Ralph, pits in lap 73, (for the 3rd time) and, not wanting to leave his brother in the lurch, persuades his car to blow up. (Down to 9, which is where we stay ... at last) The final 3 laps were really suspensful (for me, anyway ... my Renault's in the lead), what with Button driving so well. Finally, it's all over.  Trulli takes his first ever win.  Button is right behind him, in second. Third place man is Barrichello, who is ........ almost an entire lap behind........ The rest of the runners are all more than a lap behind. (Hey, it's not often that you can be more than a lap behind and still be in fourth place...)  All-in-all, one of the strangest things I've seen in a while. But I loved every minute. (If only for the sheer comedic value...)  Let's hope we can have the same kind of action at the European GP next week.  See you guys there..........

      Well, hardships aside, the race at Monaco was non-stop excitement from the start. The hightlight being the showdown between second place Button and first place Trulli. Onb the last laps Button pushed the race to it's limits when he came within 0.4 seconds of Trulli. Rubins Barrichello finished in a comfortable third behind Button. Only nine racers remained in the last five laps with Ralph Schumacher having to pull out. It was Trulli's first F1 win and a well deserved one at that.

      After a having to restart the race due to Toyota driver Panis stalling, we've seen BAR Honda driver Sato cut Michael Schumacher off, forcing him into fifth place, as Renault teamates Trulli and Alonso take the lead. Later on Sato's engine would gush out a blinding thicket of smoke causing David Coultard to crash and forcing him out the race. The safety car has already been deployed several times for other incidents. All of this occured within the first thirty laps and left only fourteen racers. Later Michael Schumacher would move into third and begin to build pressure on the Renault drivers. As I type this second place Alonso has had crashed and is now out of the race in addition to Michael Schumacher! Both had unrelated crash incidents inside the tunnel, both within four laps apart of eachother and the drama continues to unfold!

       SOME CLARITY ON THOSE WHO SUCK AND THOSE WHO DON'T:   I always hear people talking about things like, "  That team sucks  ", "  Why do they bother racing?  " and my all-time favourite, " Why can't they all be as good as the Ferraris? ".  This is a misconception of GINORMOUS proportions. Let's break this down a little. We'll start at "Qualifying times..."  Anybody ever notice how the difference between the guy who qualifies in 1st place and the guy who qualifies in last place, is around 3 to 5 seconds? That's not a helluva gap. (Okay, in F1 terms, that's a country mile...... but anyway)  At the end of a race, the gap between the guy who comes first and the guy who comes stone last, is around 1 to 1 and a half minutes. After a 60 to 70 lap race, that's not ALL that much, really.  The major thing to consider, is the fact that there are only 10 teams in F1. (The 10 'best' teams in the world). There are only 20 drivers in F1. (The 20 'best' drivers in the world). This has got to say something.........  For all those that want to mock and make fun of the teams/drivers that aren't doing too well, just sit back for a second and consider that these are the 'BEST' in the business. You think you can do any better, prove it.

       THE F1 RANT BLOG GET'S OFF TO A FLYING START:   This being my first post, I want to use it to welcome all F1 fans out there. I will be posting updates after every race of the season. (I will back-log and start at the first race). I won't focus too much on Driver / Constructor points, as those can be found anywhere. I will mostly be posting my thoughts and views on each particular race. (Granted, most of those thoughts and views will be a little biased, as I'm especially a Renault fan .....) I love Renault, coz they're my favourite. I hate Ferrari, coz they keep whipping the Renaults. I dislike Minardi, coz, well honestly, they suck.......  But that's just me.  NB: A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO Black_Lotus, Garson007 AND THE REST OF NAG CREW...... MEET THEM ALL HERE AT   urlLink NAG

      Shot a docie for radio-controlled hobbies today. Or rather a segment of it: off-road, gas-powered radio controlled cars. The other segments include plains and helicopters. Very interesting, and a lot of fun. Great, good people. Anyway, after that, went home, went to watch Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Now, I was really looking forward to it. And no, I'm not disappointed, but it could and should have been better. The teachers, whom added so much flavor to the previous offerings, were absent for most of the movie. Characters and events weren’t fleshed out well enough, and something just felt missing. Other than that, it was a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and I'd easily recommend it. Just don't go in with the same anticipation as I did.

      It's today, as opposed to yesterday and tomorrow. I wish it was tomorrow, seeing as today it was the same old, same old. Tomorrow at least I'm watching Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Not commenting on that, though, I'll have a more informed opinion tomorrow evening. Today, was, for a lack of a better word, very average. I know I covered this allready, but that's exactly how the whole of today felt. Had its moments, everyday does, but otherewise...*sigh*. I am still strugling with whether or not to finish up my studies, or go do something productive. Yes, they are often mutually exclusive. I might have more to say tomorrow, stay...connected?

      Guess this was inevitable. Wednesday has arrived, and is, thankfully, almost over. My first published work arrived : The colours of Life, from the international library of poetry. Would love to celebrate it properly, but alas, no money. Why can't they, and with "they" i'm referring to the elusive, unkown, always-present, mysterious 'them'. Why can't "they" give or reward success with free booze? If a south african achieves something, shouldn't we celebrate, or at least congratulate? Anyway, ignore this as just the woes of a troubled mind. And remember alcohol is actually bad for you. *sigh* Wish someone would read this and be kind...

      Yes, well, now that I have to study, the time is crawling. Funny that. Not much happened today that is worth sharing. My car is finally registered in my name. After a month of hassle with Nebank (useless buggers), meaning full insurance coverage will shortly follow, meaning I can now drive my car anywhere I want. Life is all about these little freedoms. When you're restricted, life gets hard. Real hard. Something as simple as a bank hiring lazy, good-for-nothing morons, can screw up a whole month. No insurance, means your car is unsafe. Period. Park outside for just a minute...are you really gonna take that chance? No. But its not only this. Many things. Small thiings we take for granted. They all equal small freedoms. None of us want them taken away. Advice? No, I don't have any. Sorry. This is something we're all going to have to learn to deal with, for ourselves. Best of luck.

      Yes. That's it exactly. Got the results of last monday's used-to-be-reffered-to-as-debacle's results back. They're bad, but not that bad. In fact, they're so "not bad" that it is enitirely feasible to continue on with what I was. In other words, I'll probably finish my Masters. Damn, here I was thinking I should get a job and start making good money. Another dream down the toilet as it were. For now, anyway. To be rather blunt, to not continue now, would be plain stupidity. It might not be what I want to do, but giving it up now, would mean I wasted 6 months for nothing. Might as well take another year, and be called master for the rest of life. Until I get my PHD ofcourse. *sigh* Life really does trip you up, and maybe, this, as previously thought, might not be the worst thing. In fact, it might turn out to be the best. But I can't help feeling dissapointed, that another opportunity for change, is gone. Ah well, such is life, I'll just it back and enjoy it. What else can I do?

      Hell, what am I doing? Is this what it comes down to? Typing the story of my life in a little brown box? *sigh* And we come to it. Too soon maybe, but I've allready repeated my title, so I better start explaining it. Life , imo, has developed the incredible abillity to trip you up when things are going ok. We all aim for supreme 'ok-ness'. I was there damnit! I had it. And then, in one foul swoop, last monday morning, at 10:50am, it was gone. What are you left with? I can't answer that. What I do know, is that tomorrow is the first day of the rest of my life. No really, the end result of monday's debacle is made known. Then, maybe, I can finaly start to move on. *sigh* Yes, that's how I feel. But you know what? This place aint so bad, it's just the waiting that becomes a bit much...

      Almost everyone likes / loves their music. Music is an integral part of their lives, whether we choose to believe it or not.   Many listen to music in their cars, their homes even outdoors using discmans or whatever device they prefer. We can’t get enough of it. For many, music has become a drug, a psychological addiction.   And this is the main question of this article…    Is music bad for us ?   Well, firstly, what is music ? Waves, music exists in the form of waves that have been modulated by a device. These waves exist in the form of electronic pulses that travel through a number of other devices, to an amplifier and then to an output device of some kind, such as a speaker.  That’s all very well and good but it still doesn’t help us work out whether music has a possibly negative effect on us or not. Or does it ?  Music is extremely complex. The waveform that our computers and sound reproduction equipment can store and reproduce has an extremely high resolution, meaning that a lot more than a beat, and instrument and a few words can be contained in a small track of sound. A good example of this is Dolby Pro Logic, which can detect encoded tracks in music found on DVDs.   DVDs are encoded with sound tracks that actually have several other sound tracks encoded into the main sound track. This system can successfully carry up to 22 smaller sound tracks in two larger sound tracks, demonstrating the quality of a pair of sound tracks.  ...again, where am I going here ? Well, I’m leading up to an interesting point :P  So, we know our music today is extremely complex, we know the quality is also very high.   And now for the linkage...   We as humans only use approximately 10% of our brain’s capabilities… the rest belongs to our sub-conscious mind which, it has been demonstrated, is able to process subliminal messages where our normal mind cannot or sees nothing.  Our sub-conscious mind can implement ideas and information included in subliminal messages in our lives or our actions, like hypnosis.  An example of this was demonstrated when a movie was edited to have an image of glass with water in it every 25th frame. The audience watching this movie didn’t notice the altered 25th frame, but their sub-conscious mind did, and after a few minutes, at least 85% of the audience got up to get something to drink, almost simultaneously *insert twilight music here*.  It is now possible for subliminal messages to be included in music… simply because the raw quality of the waveforms we listen to are highly complex. It is possible to find these messages in some artists’ music using professional sound editing software. I will not mention names…  Happy thinking !

      These last two weeks has been so long and so boring.  I'm even considering writing a book for myself. Just to let the boredom settle a bit. Maybe I'm to used to a hectic life. Cool thing is I'm happy, happier than I have been the past month. Owell getting to the point.  What is boredom really? Is it a Human invention? Is it instinctive? Where does this phenomanon come from? I have no idea, but I do have my points. I beleave boredom is a human creation, somebody invented it, without thinking of what might happen. What did the cavemen do? They did not know boredom, because they did not know how it is without boredom. Same goes for animals, their lives are so boring, but they are not bored, because they don't know a better feeling. So is anything that enlightens you a bad thing? Not neccesarally, but don't go and enjoy yourself to much, if you know it won't last long. For it will just cause boredom, even if that action was fun before knowing a better one.   So what am I saying? Boredom is a creation if you enjoy what your doing to much at a particular time...

       IS VIOLENCE PART OF OUR GENETIC BUILD-UP?   I recently heard the story (on  urlLink NAG ) of a guy who, for no apparent reason, was stabbed while walking along the beach. This got me thinking about violence without provocation......  Perhaps our human nature, in itself, defines that we, as human beings, do not require a motive to be violent. Perhaps we are inherently violent and simply spend most of our lives trying to keep the urge at bay. (Even subconsciously)  Is it at all possible, that we are born with the natural tendencies of violence, but are groomed ... from young ... to ignore it?  Children, with no proper social up-bringing (and even some 'with'.....) will instinctively fight and argue over a favourite play-thing. I've seen many cases where children as young as 12 months, instinctively lash out when something they like is taken away from them......  As a species, we have learned to harness most of this inner-hatred, but it is still there and occasionally rears its ugly head. (Think unnecessarily violent road-rage...)  The wild-men of yore, used to knock each other senseless with clubs. Are we really that much more advanced than the wild-men we once were? Perhaps we've simply found new and improved ways of 'clubbing' each other...............

      My first post as generalkoffi.  (There's no "_")  In light of the U.S. Debates, I have been thinking about the new world order and where Earth is going.  As everyone knows, the United States invaded Iraq without the sanction of the United Nations.  Whether this was good or bad depends on your point of view.  The US is silently declaring itself the supreme power on Earth.  What I want to know is, what will happen when the world's lifeblood (oil) runs out?  The middle-east, which the US is so interested in, will essentially become poverty stricken.  Will China, the worlds largest country, become a new superpower?  Will the US slowly sink away, like Britain did, when it's oil empire crumbles?  Will the United States collapse quickly and dramatically?  China would also be devastated by the loss of oil, but China has 20% of the world's population.  How will we transport anything without petroleum and how will this affect global politics?  It's all very depressing to think about, and this might happen before I'm middle-aged.

       TO FORUM OR NOT TO FORUM ... THAT, APPARENTLY, IS THE QUESTION:   I remember a time when forums were a place you went to when you needed help with something and had to ask the world. I remember a time when the only people who actually hung around forums were the technical geeks. I remember a time when chat-sites were the ONLY way to converse online.  Things have changed since then.   Nowaways, forums are more generalised and allow room for open-ended conversation. Nowadays, forums have developed to a point where friends can be made (or lost...). I have found that more and more people have been gravitating towards the use of forums because of its many benefits, and at the same time, have been leaving the chat-rooms across the net, empty and bland.  I think the major contributor for this phenomenon is due to the fact that, unlike a chat-site or IRC, you have time to consider your responses and formulate your phrases. This is somewhat of an ego booster, as it can make even the densist character seem witty and intelligent. Perhaps someday, chat-sites will fall away altogether, leaving forums as the only means of online chat.  Doubtful, but hey, a man can dream, can't he?  BTW: Visit my blog at  urlLink SybAGreY's F1 Rants   Thanks to B_L for giving me the chance to add my views in here.

       *This is an editted transcript from IRC channel #nag on Blabber.net (Part 2 can be found lower down on page)*   *Black_Lotus* okay... now I see  *Black_Lotus* you're saying that things like the Geneva Convention and the UN are jokes when there is a global superpower basically controlling the world  *Black_Lotus* and that we shouldn't cry over the deaths of three soldiers because they are soldiers  *Black_Lotus* now, I agree with you to a certain point, however, just because the UN and other countries can't enforce those rules doesn't mean that we should just throw them out the window  *Garson007* Try telling that to the USA Generals Black_Lotus  *Black_Lotus* I agree that the world and UN haven't done enough in forcing justice to America (after all, invading a country no matter what is still against the rules) but that doesn’t mean that there are people out there who want total anarchy and violence and have nothing better to do than kill  *ayjayess* Black_Lotus : do you wish to live in the real world or the fake one ?  *ayjayess* do you have any knowledge of the Sarajevo (Croatia)  *ayjayess* the Serbs...etc.  *Black_Lotus* ayjayess: I am optimistic to a point. "Live as though the world is as it should be to show it what it can be"  *Black_Lotus* yes  *ayjayess* do you have any idea how long it took the UN to respond ?  *Garson007* Black_Lotus :  Remember USA was going to attack Iraq, doesn't matter if UN gave thumbs up or not.   *ayjayess* do you have any idea of what the UN saw and yet the did nothing ?  *Black_Lotus* yes  *ayjayess* aye  *ayjayess* Black_Lotus : very nice quote  *Black_Lotus* ayjayess: but at least they intervened to a point. Look at Rwanda! Nobody did shit.  *Black_Lotus* here's my summary:  *Garson007* Arghhh if it does not concern the USA it gets vetoed  *ayjayess* YES!  *ayjayess* if the US can't profit, it doesn't matter anymore  *ayjayess* if the us isn't going to get hurt it is disregarded  *ayjayess* *US  *Garson007* USA has so much power in the UN...  *ayjayess* they basically fund the UN is so many ways  *ayjayess* The UN owes its power to the US to a certain extent  *Garson007* Plus they are part of the five. They can veto any decision  *ayjayess* yep  *ayjayess* like the race conference held by the UN in 2001 here in Cape Town...  *ayjayess* it wasn't held because the US decided it wasn't going to be a part of it  *Garson007* Russia, USA, UK. ETC is part of the five  *Black_Lotus* I understand that the world is a shithole at the moment and has been for some time. I know that the UN and NATO and Britain are all America's puppets and that they are too afraid to hurt the trade and global super power. But this shouldn't cause us to forget that there are rules and structure, right and wrong. I know that not all Americans are war supporters or killers, neither are all Muslims, Indians etc. If we forget our...  *ayjayess* look I do agree that society (the world) should strive towards a system that they abide by (rules) but to say that that system actually works in practice is ignorance  *Black_Lotus* ethics and morals and fail to question and debate then the world will turn into a real crap hole. You have seen the images of children with the soldiers in Iraq. There is a lot of good being done at this moment (Red Cross, UNICEF, Salvation Army etc.) but we forget all that because the news is riddled with violence, hate and lies.  *ayjayess* Black_Lotus  : good is being done, yes, but the motivation, that’s what we are trying to address isn't it ?

       *This is an eddited transcript from IRC channel #nag on Blabbernet*   *Black_Lotus* Many wars throughout time have been unjust... I understand that these things are out of control and I can see your sentiments because we don't want to live in a bad world, but cheering for one side without reviewing the other is wrong  *ayjayess* we do live in a world where a lot of good is being done, all I'm trying to say is that often the motivation behind a war (like Iraq) was not correct  *ayjayess* furthermore, we are dominated by a super power whether we accept it or not  *Black_Lotus* I believe the U.S. has less than 20 years at being the global super power (that is, unless John Titor is correct), but the UN and other nations should have placed trade and economic sanctions on the U.S  *ayjayess* yes, a system exists that defines rules and an organisation, but do we actually adhere to those rules ?  *ayjayess* or do we adhere to them when we want to  *Black_Lotus* America cannot rule forever and that is what the rest of the world is failing to see. They are in a recession, unemployment is the highest in years, their currency is failing and global opinion of them is plummeting.   *ayjayess* The US produces so much itself, sanctions won't hurt it and even if it does, the US can simply take what they want when they want if it became ugly enough  *Garson007* but the UN and other nations should have placed trade and economic sanctions on the U.S *-- didn’t you mean not...  *Black_Lotus* America does not have the agriculture sector to sustain it's populating (SA and a few others do)  *ayjayess* no, he wants them to place sanctions on the US to prevent them from creating the war on Iraq  *ayjayess* so the US would start to starve if sanctions were imposed, yes, now it makes sense  *Garson007* Black_Lotus: It's called black-marketing, more money for smugglers  *ayjayess* but still, the US can simple take what they want because that situation would cause them to try to survive and they are big enough to do what they want  *ayjayess* the black market ain't large enough to sustain part of a country that size  *Black_Lotus* I am not stupid.

      A Story of John Titor, written and directed by Kirby Malone - a live movie.  With multiple video projections, a cast of eight singer-actors, and an eight-piece band, TimeTravelerZeroZero presents an apocalyptic critique of consumer culture, and a chilling vision of a near-future dystopia brought about by a growing police state. A team of more than twenty multimedia artists created state-of-the-art animations and video montages for the innovative scenography which depicts time travel and the worlds of 1975, 2000, 2015 and 2036, in this tale of John Titor, a mysterious figure who posted voluminously on the Internet for six months from late 2000 to early 2001. Was he a time traveler from thirty years in the future, or a hoax? Was he a crackpot or a prophet? Was he science fiction or living proof of the latest theories of quantum physics? With a score that features original songs and soundscapes, and also draws on a dialectical blend of industrial music, trip-hop, rap, country, opera and Bengali singing, Time Traveler Zero Zero is part rock opera, part hybrid cinematic/theatrical performance, designed to provoke thought, and provide listening and viewing pleasure, for young adult audiences of all ages.

      Hi everyone. I created this Blogger as I felt I needed a better place to display my thoughts. I'm not going to go around spurting abuse at minorities (or majorities), I'm simply here to, hopefully, transfer some of the more interesting thoughts in my head down to a place where people can comment/critiscize on them freely.  I can take a joke and I don't mind being flammed, but please try and keep all comments constructive. Other than that, I hope you find what I find interesting.  P.S.  Anyone interested in writing random opinions, news, events, reviews, stories etc. on The Lotus Zone please don't hesitate to  urlLink email me.

       The Game   In a recording sent to al-Jazeera, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the mastermind behind the recent terrorist attacks and abductions in Iraq, vowed to "continue the game... until the end".   Is this the true reflection of how these extremists see it? As a game? A game where killing innocent civilians is all part of the fun? If that is true then I guess they should take all the bombing raids and prisoner abuse made by the U.S. as "part of the game" as well...

      Over the past few weeks there has been a tremendous upsurge in the kidnapping of civilians and, ultimately, the execution of them. This terrible new trend is race, religion and nationality blind. In fact, a new video of a South Korean man from an extremist group demanding the withdrawal of South Korean troops from Iraq has surfaced. They, apparently, have given 24 hours or they will behead the man.   This shocking new approach in terrorism is spreading throughout the world as more and more terrorist groups seem to be latching onto and implementing it. Hell, it seems as easy as a step-by-step program to implement and is, emotionally, very effective.  The question now is how can nations like the U.S. prevent or detour these merciless attacks on civilians? Obviously, they will never bow to the demands of the terrorists which makes me wonder what the true motives of the terrorists are.  Should they fight fire with fire and execute captured POWs whenever a U.S. citizen is killed? Should they force their citizens to withdraw from these "hostile" nations where they are at risk of being kidnapped? Or should they ignore them?  So far it appears that this is what the U.S. is doing, however I would like to see the reaction the South Korean government has if their citizen is killed.  Of course, traveling to "high risk" places like the Middle East and South East Asia has never detoured tourists, but now it seems that the U.S. and other nations may have to abandon their efforts in Iraq just to prevent more aid workers being killed.

      It's a shame that I can't think of anything really insightful to start of my stay here. Sorry. This will happen occasionally, and it's no fault of mine. Maybe that should be the topic of this post. Inspiration. Why is it such a rare bird? We often only feel it flying past, see it out of the corner of our eyes, and yes, it does occasionally crap on our heads. But every now and then, on those rare moments it'll sit quietly in front of you, life becomes clear. It all makes sense. We arrive at insights that would baffle even the most hardened scientist, and impress even a porn star with its size and depth. It's an unexplained phenomenon. Best we can do is sit back and enjoy those rare moments of clarity.

      We live in interesting times. Over eight nations posses the ability to launch a potentially devastating nuclear attack. When “Little Boy” was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 the world changed. Instantly, nearly a million people were killed and countless others affected by deadly radioactive fallout. That bomb was 21 kilotons. We know have the ability to use atomic weapons a thousand times more powerful than that. But why all this now?      According to news sources, two discs containing “sensitive and classified” nuclear secrets have gone missing from the nuclear research facility in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Allegedly, they disappeared on July 7th, however the announcement was only made on the 16th. Coincidently, this is the 49th anniversary of the first ever-atomic explosion that occurred in the same place back in 1945.  The information regarding the specifications of a nuclear device were once the most secret things on earth. Nowadays you could pretty much ask Google and it would tell you. The knowledge of how to build an atomic weapon is no longer an issue. The issue at hand is that of acquiring the ways and means to build it. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, the world was left with a disorganized and under funded Russian. With the end in sight, many had simply abandoned their jobs or worked bellow par. This was disastrous when it came to the old Soviet nuclear program. Most of the stocktaking and records were missing or incorrect. This left the world not knowing just how much of the second largest nuclear arsenal was safe.  The mostly likely place for some sort of atomic weaponry to come out of would be the Ukraine. The Ukrainian government was left with the third largest arsenal and had no trained engineers or scientists to manage it. The international community supported them, however the risk of theft is still high. Also, Libya has allowed for the United States to inspect their chemical, biological and nuclear facilities. The chemical and biological weapons were to the standard U.S. intelligence had anticipated; however their nuclear research program was shockingly close to fully developing an atomic device.  The most likely way for a nuclear attack on a western nation would come from a state-sponsored terrorist attack. Think about it. If you have nuclear technology and want to damage the U.S. what do you do? You can’t launch because the U.S. will launch hundreds back. The solution is simple. Provide the ways and means for terrorists to perform the attack in American. How can they retaliate against an enemy with no capital or country?      This would almost cause a global war. America would viciously attack anyone it suspected to be the culprit. This would lead to other nations grabbing the opportunity and starting “grudge wars” of their own (i.e. Israel and Palestine) God forbid nuclear weapons are used.   The CIA and other intelligence agencies now believe that it is highly likely a small, compact nuclear device such as a “suitcase nuke” or “dirty bomb” could be used against a Western target. They have also began to implement steps in dealing with a nuclear or biological threat.  The question of whether or not a rogue nuclear weapon would be used is no longer important. The questions of “when” and “where” overshadow it. Perhaps J. Robert Oppenheimer, a developer of the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project, said it best:  “We knew the world could not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita: ‘I am became Death, the destroyers of worlds.’ I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.”

      So far this year there have been four documented executions of the Conflict In Iraq-related personnel. The first was Nicholas Berg, whose haunting beheading video shocked the entire world.  Soon after came the less publicized murder of Robert Jacob who was gunned down by extremists. Third in the spate of killings was Paul Johnson, an American aircraft engineer who worked on the Apache gunship. He too, was beheaded. The most recent victim of this new terrorist tactic is South Korean translator, Kim Sun-Il, who was murdered in the same way as his American counterparts. Even more recently, a U.S. marine’s “dead-or-alive” status is unable to be confirmed, and three Turkish citizens have been threatened with death.      Contrary to popular belief, this “execution” tactic adopted by the terrorists is not new. In 2000, journalist Daniel Pearl was kidnapped in Mumbai, India, by a group calling themselves the National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty. He was held for two years before his decapitated body was found.   What is the point of all this? Well, this is another tactic employed by the extremists to arouse the public and intimidate them, however it is not entirely their fault. The mere fact that they are there is because of the U.S. government invading Iraq. But then again, it is not their sole responsibility either. A person can’t go into a situation such as that currently occurring in Iraq and not expecting to be in danger.  Now we have the issue of retaliation. It is the U.S. (and several other governments’) policy not to negotiate with terrorists. So where does this leave the victims and their families? To date, only one real arrest has been made upon the perpetrators of these events: that being the shoot-out between Saudi Arabian police and leader Abdel Aziz al-Muqrin. Three others were killed with Abdel Aziz al-Muqrin and 12 other suspected members of the cell were captured.   The U.S. government and armed forces do issue statements of condolences to the families of the victims, but no real measures are being taken to prevent the killings. This will lead us to one point: the U.S. will, eventually, pull out of Iraq and the terrorists will find that this tactic proved ineffective. They now know that only an attack on American soil will give the desired effect, and shake the nation. This option is very unlikely to be used by smaller groups as they lack the necessary skills and funding to pull it off. They will therefore have to move onto the next best thing: an attack on Israel.      Many people have said that the “end” (in reference to the end of the world, as prophesied by the Christian disciple John) would start in Israel with a catastrophic terrorist attack. This is reflected in The Bible Code (by Michael Drosnin) where he claims that the text predicts a nuclear holocaust in Israel. As unlikely as it seems, this theory  is being taken seriously, however I cannot see any way to avoid this “stalemate” between an overly powerful nation that believes it can “police the world”, and a hidden group of combatants employing guerrilla tactics.   Hypothetically, let’s assume that the terrorists are foiled and that the world is “safe”… What will become of the U.S.? With unemployment on the rise, inflation drifting upwards and the market in a state of recession, it seems certain that it will collapse. But look what World War II did to the global economy. There was an employment boom, morale boost, industrial rebirth and a significant increase in new research and development. In fact, it could be said that World War II was inevitable, if only to assist the world. Could this not be what America is attempting? “War makes money…?” We may never know, but until an equally potent rival power competes with the U.S, or unless the world unites, it seems that the United States, as troubled as it is, may stick around for a while longer.

       The Eagle Has Landed    What:  Apollo 11 touches down on the lunar surface   When:  20 July, 1969   Where:  The Sea of Tranquillity on the Lunar Surface   Who:  Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin   How:  Travelled to the Moon via Saturn V rocket and landed in module named "The Eagle"   Why:  The “space race” against the Soviet Union. President Kennedy's promise to put a man on the Moon before 1970.   What Conspiracy Theorists Say:  The Lunar landing by Apollo 11 was faked in a studio as the Soviet Union seemed to be ahead in the "space race". A further loss in this regard would deal a resounding blow to American morale. Numerous "mistakes" have been pointed out and many of these have been disproved.
