      Oh No.So many people getting sick these few days. My Mom, kaka grandma,kaka a bit headache cos of the few sleepness and tiring praying nites at farrer road. Must force my mom to the nearby stadium for a short walk. High blood pressure still does not want to take her medication. kaka skipped work today cos we reached home near one yesterday. Yesterday was a torture during the praying session. Visiting at temples and at a coffin shop etc... The bus was damn slow. it cant overtake the lorries that were seated mediums. Cos its like a disrespect for the gods. Damn hungry and tired. The pipping warm Red bean soup greeted us when the whole journey was completed. Although it does not taste nice but i guess we were all very hungry. Kaka was so called involved with the traffic yesterday. One thing that surprise me... There are so many versions of " toa ya peh". I was wondering which one should be the right one.like a fashion show for toa ya peh... hahahaha. But its all up to indiviual to believe. I am neutual. Believing myself will be the greatest thing. The sounding of the drums and all those sounds...make my head spin spin and spin. Theres going to have another session of praying today. haizzzzzzzzzzz.... ********************************************************************************** Just enjoyed and finished my bowl of Maggie mee....

      26 July 2004 Time: 1.27pm  Phew... Regilious .... Yesterday went for a prayer session actually is regarding the contribution of good deeds for the family. On TV, we usually see mediums having their mouth pierced, tongue pierced. But yesterday it was a real experience for my eyes see.According to the culture, doing all these are like doing a good deeds to cover up all the bad happenings for the family. And also prosperity for the younger generations. Help them with the minor things like folding of the Joss paper etc. hmmm might sound interesting for its very tiring ...kneeing high and low for praying..&nbsp; The weather was bad too and was raining. Poor guy that got pierced and poor kaka too. We all left without breakfast and he still have to be drenched with dirty clothes on. End of the session, kaka's papa was pissed off with certain things and said: Baby ah... Next time u dun go for this type of thing..Next yr i tell them we not free". His mom was so pissed off and scolded his dad. haizzz... What to do ...what to do... This morning, she told me that the number that was given&nbsp;by so called hell God, Tua ya peh was striked 1st price. Too bad didnt buy. She keeps sort of scold kaka's dad.hahahaha/....  ******************************************************************************** Today, kaka grandma came here to stay for a period of time. Wah.. She like shifting the whole place over, even rice lah,..biscuits lah... paper plates lah...aiyo... so much things... She is a teochew with a loud voice. Almost all the relatives came to help. Hmmm. Busy for everyone, for me too. Accompany kaka's mom to the market, helping to keep clothes, help to prepare for the curry and fried bee hoon that she's going to cook. phew... Seemed grandma is not so used to our place for she has been staying at Redhill for many years and she is familiar with place there. Looks like shes not quite happy with staying with us cos its a total new place for her. We will be going to be very busy soon. Taking care of this old folk. Tomorrow, going for hill climbing... Love and missed the hill. Have been going to macritchie ... Time to change spots. Then at least can go and eat the vegetarian food there. Yippee.... Look forward to tomorrow......

      Date : 23July 2004  Time: 9.40am  I don't understand that why are there some people who are not able to handle things rationally without thinking and viewing the whole scenarios. Some like to let the whole world know about things happening to them even for quarreling which is not a pleasant sight to the public. And as if it is their own home. Yesterday, met up with a friend to settle on some issues on mobil phone bill.Transfering of ownership to another person.the&nbsp;&nbsp;The queue will damn bloody long and we waited abt 45 mins . Our turn at last.,.... But.......  The conversation goes.....  Teller: May i have your IC please? Me: I lost my IC , could i use passport instead. Friend handed over her IC. Teller checking details in the system. Teller: I am afraid u will have to pay 200sgd as a deposit cos of your past records of your bill payment... Cos transfering to another account is the same as opening a new acct. Me: Is this amt to be sent with the bill or have to be paid in cash Teller: I am afraid u have to pay in cash. Kaka: Is this a regulation? Teller: Yes. Friend: (Start yelling) I thought i told u that i want this to be settled by this month...and see cos u din settle the bill. Kaka: ( Start Yelling too) This is a new case ok. U cant lump the two case together,. Me: Do u have 200bucks ? I pay u by next week? Friend: I dun have.  So both friend and kaka so called discussed ( quarrelled i will say)&nbsp;behind the scenes where pple are watching.  Kaka: Take your passport and we leave this place. I am not going to do anything.  Haizzzzz.... what a day....  Sometimes pple tend to take it for granted. People tend to forget about the past. I did told kaka, the amt of bills that he had once cleared and the things that he had bought for her, will be able to cover infact superceded with the bill. many a times, humans are not able to visualise a greater picture and are not calm at handling things, they just see one side of the story for their blind spot have been obstructed, this i do not blame. The naiveness of a person.... the way of handling things,.... If they are not able to judge things properly, how are they going to strive in this world. Never! Their mind will be forever lerthagy. I do not know. haizzzzzzzz  Sign Off, Devilish ......  &nbsp;

      Haiz. My leg aching today. Later have to go to a Recruit Center. Don't even know i can walk properly or not.  Yesterday went to Macritchie again and try to take the same route, but instead of walking to Upper Bukit Timah, We reversed and walk back to Macritchie Central stage, which in total is about estimate 11k.Enjoying our walk half way, rain falls on us... Getting heavier and heavier..Oh shit, we were stucked in the middle of reserve track. No choice have to proceed with the journey. And the worse part is i am wearing a black bra and a Gordano white T- Shirt. It became so translucent. OMG/ Used my bag to cover the front, all wet from outside in.haizzz..still thinking of eating the tao sa pia at balestier. There goes my crave.  My friend Julie has to got to town to collect her air ticket for she will be travelling soon so in the end i got to go home. My musckes ache like hell. Cos due to the cold weather.   Anyway, i got to meet up with kaka for our evening plans.   Next week, we will proceed with our routine walk ..Maybe considering to Sentosa after the walk for a good sun tan. ( good idea..Have to ask Julie)  To be continued...........................................   ***********************************************************************************  One thing that i realise in part and parcel to be togther in regardless of relationship and couples.  Besides communication, finance is also the root of quarrels even between friends. Its not easy to handle this properly. Anything to do with money or money relating matters..Credit card bills,....signing the card to buy things is alaways an easy thing, cos u just need to waste minimum of ur hand energy to sign. But once the bill comes... Oh no....  so morale of the story..Just spend within our spending power,Control...not&nbsp;to waste money on those unnecessary stuff.&nbsp;Acting rich in this realistic and modernised society is no longer in trend. Money is never any a good root&nbsp;in relationship, friendships, family ties.   &nbsp;  Sign off Devilish Angel/   &nbsp;

Then coffee session later with my ex-colleague.  Sometimes, i get to think...Mind starts to wonder again.hmmmmmm......  I do not know whether i am really suitable for. Sometimes, i feel like apologising to him. For i do not know how to make him happy. I am so lost and do not know what to do. Is that what he really want when sometimes he did not mention anything and seems that things are going well. I really do not know. Sometimes, i feel like crying.  ÊTES-VOUS RELI DANS L'AMOUR ?

      04 July 12.22am  Meeting my friend for another himm climbing session later at 7am and cant sleep. On Sat,03 July 2004. went to a wedding dinner,....At Fu Zhuo Assosiation,,..OMG..There's really nothing to comment for this wedding dinner for it sucjks. It is simply a comparison of the riches there. The place is quite run down makes me think of 7th month performance..With all the singers n the MC was the actress..In The child's hope as "Ah Mah" Service sucks ..everything sucks. No changing of new plates. Only continuous pouring of drinks. Even the red wine sucks. Btu food was ok. PPle complain abt seats allocations. There are quite a no. of tables that are empty. With this type of place should have worn my torn down jeans with a normal tops//And not to be dressed up for the occasion. The bride and bridegroom.Bof Heavy Duty ones. Impolite.Might as well waste some money to eat across the street. Relatives came... The washrooms have only 2 cubicles and everyone was lining up for it. Everyone was very dressed.Thinking that it is the hotel dinner which i think they might as well hold it in Community Centres liek the Malays and Indian do. Haizzzz//.....What to do/..... Ka ka sleeping now like a pig.....  Sigh off Devilish Angel

      Today, Sat-03 July 2004 Time 9.50am  I am back to my blog writing full of unhappiness that have been bottled up in me for a long time. I was so frustrated that i have cancelled all my birthday so called smalll celebrations. While tidying up the rooms and drawers, i realise there are quite a number of bills lying around.That is not under his name. The first question that pop up in my mind will be why all these bills are with him... Meaning he paid for her bills?? Why is the treatment so different... Maybe i am wrong. Buying Diamond necklace, bags...OSIM massager... etc.I am not angry that he did not get all these stuff for me, my anger is abt why different treatment??When she ask for the phone bill to be paid up.. He will by all means fork up the money to pay...  Sounds weird. A remark was passed." Why didnt u ask me "Hows ur day".In my heart this come across my mind."U prefer someone who can be more vocal than one that has help to make sure that when he comes back. Everything is in place. Diff set of mind.  Well this sentence: I am in a Karaoake. This place brings me sweet memories. Thanks, I am glad i am still ur friend. What does that mean. Just a brief read thru will mean nothing..She still treat him as a friend. but if u were to interpret in another way..It simply means hes is still in her heart. And theres nothing she can do except to be just a friend and no further,.  I was been passed a remark: I hope u can be not so Kah Poh. Saying that this have happened to me before and i do not want u to face it too. Just because i did not wait for him at the place that we are supoosed to meet. That disappoints me.  Then he will just say: OK next time i will just keep my mouth shut. What the fuck remarks is that.  A thought did come into my mind. Is it the time that i should shift back home and stay. Create some distance will be better?? I do not know.   Unhappy-Unconvinced

      Phew hectic weekends to and fro the hospital, kaka mom was diagnosed with high pressure on the eye and serious cataract. On friday before my third interview in CAD IT, heard crying voice that says " My right eye cant see"and a serious headache. In the evening time we brought kaka mom to the doc and was disagnosed. Have to hospitalised immediately. Brought her to SGH. Can see that she was very frightened with hospital. All of us have to accompany her in hospital and i have to help out with the housework. Washing, cooking , vaccuming and mopping the floor and also to and fro the hospital. Normally she has treated me quite well and its my pay back time to take care of her. On top of that, i need to start work today. Haizz..cant take care of her. No choice and have to help out after work. The first day of work was interesting , i am attached with sales VP. Hmmm... A very strong driven person, guess thats his character. Went to SIMTECH for a seminar discussion, and later to Ex-HDB for solution providing services. But the thing that spoil the day was the stupid bus ride home from Bt Merah to home, 851, the stupid bus ride took me near 2 hrs. My throat and head was hurting like hell. Its a job although not highly paid but at least its a job which i can learn a lot of things.2 Years contract. Have to prepare for my next day of work now.  Sign Off Devilish Angel
