						   yes so, I need to do this one quick, Jessica is impatiently chomping in my ear, but anywyas, I cleaned my room today and for the first time since we moved, (3.5+ years ago) I cleaned out my dresser drawers, YAY, ish.  Then I helped my brothers, or rather, Sister Jackson and my mom clean my Brother's room.  I spent a good part of the day listening to EFY music and day dreaming about you know what and such, or rather you know who and what, anyways, we had a court of Honor at church tonight and I got the DORK MERIT BADGES! YAY! Computers and Atomic Energy, what fun!  Played some basketball (chris and I won perusual), then got home, got on here, got off here, called chris, decided to goon the bike trip, yay?????? anyways, called cameron and talked for a bit about girls and the like and then my phone died, and I didn't have my cell with me (jessica had it in the car w/ her) so I got on here and had a jolly good time talking to Carole about situations and computer stuff and merlin about day dreaming and Harry Potter, and KB about her bad day and missionary stuffs, then I let Jessica on and we worked on her blog while she talked with Kelly.  And then she spit on me! Thrice, no, fourice, "snort", fivice, anyways, I'm going now,yeah AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!

						     well, today I woke up the latest I've woken up all summer and as usual came downstairs and got on the computer.  I talked to people and learned a little more about how to work this thingy from Carole, though I still don't understand the half of a fourth of it, but oh well. Then Katie came over and hungded out with me and stuff, it was fun except we were trying to get the boys to clean their room up, but they would just sit and watch Katie and I working and complain about how hard it was to clean their room, so we left and went down stairs and I made some ramen.  Then I walked Katie home so i could get an envelope and I ran home and found Jessica at the computer talking to my people and she asked why I left and what not and told me that she already had a bunch of stamped envelopes in her room! GRRRR... anyways, Jessica and I spent forever and a day on here talking to people, well, Jessica was talking to my people pretending to be me most of the time and I was supervising to make sure she didn't make me sound gay or weird which she still managed to do regardless of my protests and stuff.  We talked to merlin most predominantly and Jessica had fun talking about bodily occurances that are better suited for william and Nathanael when my parents aren't around or when dad's in one of those "potty talk is funny" moods, but anyways, we "posted some pics" and stuff and sent pics to people via IM.  Then we went out and got gas and an air filter and some DQ. Oh, I got new bedding today to go with my mom's "new look" for my room, (YAY!?!)  So yeah, my headache was gone and all in all it was a good day.

						     I woke up this morning, as usual and did all my usual waking up stuffs, then in I went down stairs and got on the computer and made out a whole bunch of thigs to hang in my room and printed out some pictures of temples and stuff.  Then, I talked to a bunch of people on here and sent pictures to I don't know how many people of EFY and stuff.  Then, lalala, dootdeedootdeedoo...of yeah, went and saw "Sleepover" w/ my sister and her little friends. NEVER SEE THAT MOVIE!!! it's TERRIBLE!   Then I got home and went errand running with my mom, got back home, picked Jessica up from the airport, got back home at 9:30ish, took a nap to get my humungadunga headache to go away, Jessica woke me up with some Josh Groban music whihc was absolutely AMAZING!  Then I talked online a bit and went to bed, All the while my Head was pounding and my eyes were watering and my nose was running a world record marathon!

						   So..the bike trip :/ it was fun?  Wel, the biking as fun at least, especially since we were so muc faster than everybody else.  Also, the numerous crashes made the trip more worthwhile, however, getting in trouble is never good, and chris, camero, &  found numerous ways to do so, which put a damper on the outing, but anyways... I've been vacationing w/ myfamily for the past few days, seeing Kirtland and other church historical sites around there.  Today we went to the Henry Ford museum in Detroit, and the to a Detroit Tigers game, which..was?  Anyways, it's hard totype w/ this keyboard so I'm gonna stop but I'll try to write more later

						   yeah, so, today I woke up and what not right.  My grandma and uncle were here and we hung out with them.  We played some game uncle gave us for christmas that we'd never plaed before and then just messed around I guess.  Anyways, later we went and saw  The Bourne Supremacy  which was good and not quite up to snuff at the same time.  Then we came home and played Cranium until right now, which is like 5 something!  So yeah, it's been a day.

						   Family Vactions, what can I say but...well there's really nothing to say except for what we did.&nbsp; Where I left off was Detriot, So we saw a tiger's game, WOO HOO! actually, I don't like baseball and didn't like the game, oh well.&nbsp; The next day we hit up the old Henry Ford Museum which was pretty fun, I guess.&nbsp; This time we went to tour the factory and got to see them building trucl which was neat, but would've been reall cool if we'd have not've been there while they were on their lunch break, but...oh well.&nbsp; Anyways, we left there and drove to Fennville, MI, where my mom grew up.&nbsp; We saw the local drug store and grocery store and then went to some hotel in a city a few minutes away.&nbsp; Stayed the night there, ladadadada, and then the next day went back to Fennville and saw my mom's school, and the building where her ward met for church, and one of her old houses and ate at some down-home restaurant where she worked for about a week.&nbsp; That all was...fun?&nbsp; well, one thing was neat about that, we got to see that my mom's long jump record was still unbeaten in her school after 25 years, and we saw her name on a plaque for being the most outstanding female athlete in her graduating class, which both where pretty cool.&nbsp; Then, driving, driving, driving... and finally NAUVOO!&nbsp; Nauvoo was amazing!&nbsp; We stay in like some hotel house thingy which was nice and spent about 2 days walking around the Temple, seeing shows, going through buildings, and just feeling of the spirit that's in that town.&nbsp; It was by far the best part of our vacation.&nbsp; Then, on the 26th, we started for home, but first stopped in Carthage to see the jail where Joseph and Hyrum were martyred.&nbsp; The whole jail had an amazing spirit about it, and especially the room in which the were shot.&nbsp; It was incredible!&nbsp; Afterwards, we set of towards home and I'll spare the details and just give a brief overview: drive, drive drive...too much time spent in Hannibal...drive...stopped in St. Louis & stayed the night>:(...drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, bathroom, drive, drive drive, HUGE ACCIDENT!...drive, drive, whew! HOME AT LAST! WEll, the trip home took a day longer than expected for all the stops, but oh well, I got here!&nbsp; The only bad thing about getting home was that the computer was (unbeknownst to me) out being fixed!&nbsp; So I spent the earlier part of the day cleaning in preparation for company to come tomorrow and friday, and then went to Putt-Putt w/ church, came home and found the COMPUTER, HALLELUIAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

						   so, this past week has been eventful, or uneventful, however you look at it.  Well, unfruitful would probably be a better word, but anyways, What have I been up to?  Wellllllllllllllll.... missed my missionary class 3 out of 5 days this week (tear) but the days I went were fun and very educational.  Other than that I've been sleeping a lot, going to movies, and playing D & D with the fam.  So since my grandma got here, I've gone to the movies and seen  The Bourne Supremecy, The Village, Van Helsing, I Robot, Around the World in 80 days, and Dodgeball,  most of which were worth the money.   As for other things that are going on... I've been wanting to get envelopes and stamps all week to send stuff to EFY people, but haven't been able to do so, played basketball after youth night which was fun, and last and certainly least, had a time dealing with Cameron.  For some reason he's reverted to "Don't talk to Jonny Mode", which really ticks me off b/c he has absolutely no reason to do so.  The only thing I can figure is that his bike got messed up (the one I was riding on the bike trip) and his dad's making him pay for it.  The way I see it is if he'd just cut the churlish antics and talk to me like a person with average maturity would, I'd gladly pay for the minor damage that happened to the bike.   BUT,  instead he insists on acting like a 6 year old by drawing little pictures and trying to turn my friends and other people against me which is just...? AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH he's making me sick.  Pardon my french, but I sware he's more moody than a PMSing girl with a rash.  Seriously!  He's so petty and lets the dumbest things get to him.  The way I see it is that even if this whole situation gets sorted out, he's not a person worth my friendship and would have to do something totally drastic to change that opinion.  But oh well, I think my ranting is done now

						   I woke up this morning at 6:35, late for my class!  Got ready and stuff and got there around 7:30 thanks to Stephanie who was nice enough to drive me there.  The class was great!!!  I learned a lot about the basics of becoming a missionary, the MTC, and being on a mission and can't wait until tomorrow!  Afterwards, I got home, changed just a little bit, and went downtown w/ jess and steve for jessica's court hearing.  We didn't have to testify or anything though b/c the lawyer worked it out so we didn't have to, whihc was good.  We hit up taco bell and then went and got my Wallet from the Movies at Crownpoint.  Got home, hung out, played a little d 'n' d, had dinner, and just messed around the rest of the night.  Now that I think about it, the day wasn't really as long, or full I should say, as I'd thought it was, but still..anyways, heading to bed now, hopefully to wake up ONTIME tomorrow morning for my class!

						   so today, after about 3 hours of sleep I woke up around 8:30 and went to clean up the church b/c this week is my family's week to do so.... soooooooooooooo......we cleaned the church and got back home and I crashed on eliza's bed until 1:30ish which was very nice.  Then I watched a little tennis and whatever else was on TV, oooh, and I watched the USA men's basketball team trash Puerto Rico in a Pre-Olympic exhibition game.  Then...what else?  Oh, spent a good bit of time watching the kids make their  Dungoens and Dragons  characters and a little bit of time making my own, after which the older people, aka Steve, steph, Jess, Becca, and myself went and saw M. Night Shyamalan's new movie  The Village  which was nothing like I expected it to be, especially where the "Scary Factor" was concerned, but the story and such of the movie I really liked, not to mention, I thought the blind chickie in the movie wasn't totally unfortunate looking (it had to be the hair!)  Anyways, got back home and played  Settlers of Catan  w/ steve, steph, and chrissy which I eventually won.  Then everybody else went to bed and steve and I stayed up b/c there were a lot of great older (80's) movies on the tube like  The Karate Kid, Rocky IV, and Fletch .  NOw I'm on here to satisfy my journal writting for the day and think I've done so...sooooooooooooooo...goodnight

						   well, jessica left today, I had my last of 2 Fantasy football drafts which I did pretty well in.  I had to help my dad with it a lot, but in the end he probably did better than I did.  And then I just watched TV and basked in the final hour of summer, watching some karate and playing "Pokemon Stadium 2" with the kids.  That's about it.

						   Alrighty, this was my answer to the question posed to me in my profile (so check out the profile b4 you read this)  NO WAY!  Spoons, OF COURSE, are evolved from sporks which, OF COURSE, are evolved from forks which, OF COURSE, are evolved from chopsticks! I can't even believe somebody would be so ignorant as to not know that.  They definitely need to go back to Utensil Evolution 101 b/c evidentially they failed. Or maybe....Maybe it's the teachers' fault.  THAT'S IT!!!  I mean, look at it this way, I don't remember where I learned that chopstick, OF COURSE,  evolved into forks which OF COURSE, evolved into sporks which OF COURSE, evolved into spoons, but I know for a fact we never learned it in Utensil Evolution 101!  We just watched movies every class period and TV programs like "The Antiques Roadshow".  I mean, What's this world coming too!?!  People don't even know about the genealogy of the very tools that help sustain their lives!...Hmmm... *thinkning*...???...DING!*LIGHTBULB*   WOW!  I know what subject I'm going to teach when I grow up!!! FINALLY!  I'll teach Utensil Evolution 101, but I'll actually teach, unlike the "teachers", more like VCR operators, that are destroying the very foundation of our Nation's Educational system!  AND, I'm gonna write Bush and ask him what he thinks about this traveshamockery(word taken from the Miller Lite commercial)and what he plans to do about it.  If he doesn't do anything, well then I know who I'd vote for if I were old enough vote (oh, and don't get excited Kerry fans out there, b/c I definitely don't mean him). Oh and I'll write my congresswoman too and push for a bill to have a diagram of Utensil Evolution in every Utensil Evolution 101 class in the whole of the United States of A.  Maybe I could even design the poster!  YEAH!  it could look something like this  Utensil Evolution Diagram: Chopsticks > Forks > Sporks > Spoons  =  >  --E  >  -- C E  >  --O   Not bad huh!?!  Well, I'd just like to say thank you to the person who posed this question for helping me to realize my calling in life. (Oh and I apologize for calling you "ignorant" before and taking shots at your academic credibility)

						   well, today I got up early and went to the school to get my schedule changed and stayed tere for a few minutes before calling home for somebody to come give me a ride b/c I wasn't patient enough to wait.  Then I killed time before starting my first of 2 fantasy football drafts which went pretty well.  Killed a little more time and then Alex and Ashley came over and we watched "50 First Dates".  Excellent movie.  Now I'm on here, yay!

						   these past two days have consisted of being bored and being border.  Yesterday, I got to go out during the day which was fun for the most part, got home, took a nap, and then went to see Joey come back from his mission.  That was about it.  Today consisted of sitting at home, watching too much TV and eating just to have something to do.  I hate days like that.  Oh well, tomorrow I might actually do something so that's something to look forward to.

						   Where did the summer go?  It just seems unreal being back in school, like I just got out yesterday!  But HALLELUIAH for being a SENIOR!!!  Just 179 days left before freedom, FINALLY!  As far as my classes go, Team sports should be fun, as well as oceanography (b/c of the people in it)...Math on the other hand seems like it'll be a bit more challenging than last year, and European History will hopefully be easier than I'd originally thought.  Other than that, I came home today and took a looooooooong nap, got a new phone and that CAR!

						   yeah these past 2 days have had more ups and downs than the rollercoasters at Michigan's Adventure (so not very many, but still some).  First the ups... We got a new, HUGE TV!  It's humungus!  like 62 inches!  also, my parents are looking into buying a car for me, a black '98 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo!  Muy excitingo!  y que mas?  OH, my parents are also looking at getting me a new phone after the tragic car door incident, and I finally got to talk to Caity from Canadia!  Good stuff huh!  Now for the downs.  I found out about a situation with one of my friends that makes me realy sad, and I found out that I am BANNED from the 6 stake dance this saturday, whihc I was looking forward too.  OH, and the USA mens basketball team lost too.  But anyways, about the dance.  The stake presidency banned me, my friend chris, and my former friend, Cameron from the up coming dance b/c of "what happened" on the bike trip.  I mean really, we didn't do anythig BAD, and most of what they got upset with us for were a bunch of misunderstandings!  My dad says he's gonna talk to president cheney about it and give them his point of view of things (basically my point-of-view of the situation, but less biased), but I really don't care about it at the moment.  I'm just sick of the leaders riding us before we even do anything.  But whatever, I'm just stressed now, so I'll stop.
