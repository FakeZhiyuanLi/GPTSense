       (Christian Milian - Thank You) I never thought these clouds would come along and bring me so much pain. When my world was upside down I didn't think that I could make it,  I reached out my hand for you and you were there to take it.  I wanna thank you for being my strength when I thought I couldn't go on.  And I wanna thank you for showing me right when my heart was leading me wrong  for all the times I was lost and my soul was blind.  I didn't know what to do.  Somehow you pulled me through -  and I wanna thank you.  When I was down and feelin' low, looked up and you were there - somehow you knew and found me.  You were the answer to my prayers.  You shined a light when it was dark.  And opened up my eyes.  You led the way when I was lost and you helped me realize.  I will never walk alone, cause you'll be by my side.  I don't know what I'd ever do without you in my life.  With every step I take you show me there's a way and in your hands, my heart  will never go astray. So each and every day I wanna thank you    Happy Birthday Mummy!! ^^  *yawns* really tired..been up since 5:30...making mums brekkie...heheh..really simple stuff...toast..jam...cuppa tea...didnt really wanna wake anyone up =/ more tears from both of us again =*) really shoulda got her something..but i think its the first time in a long long time since ive made her brekkie...and dad was in one of his moods =/  caught by sezza in hurrsie again..and stayed with her till 4:30 cos im 'sO nice' > she shoulda been at work experience as well!! wonder how she got the day off =/ gawd...mlc chicks...so very complicated...yet bimboish > well..at least ruthie has fallen for jason...so the whole playing n dump thingie is all gone and outta the way =D hmmm...im the 'vice president' of the « §4šŠ ¢¦µß™ » (Singles 4 SexC Simon Club)...im clueless...makes no sense to me..mlc peepz gotta brush up on their grammar O.o >  and...sandii is like 'no wonder he was confused before"...and shes feeling crap that she mightve broken his relationship..me and my big mouth > and..not to mention the fact that amy likes paul as well =/  sore throats gotten worse O.o starting to cough...and my throats still burning > off to sleep..niteZ!!

       (Sowelu - I Wanna Know)  gO the blues!! ripper of a game...9-8...bOOtiful 40m field goal in the 3min of extra time by Shaun Timmins..who got he man of the match..and yes...he plays for the dragons!! hornby had a great game as well =) abit sick atm...runny nose..argh!! so annoying > at least i can relax a lil tomorrow cos of the stike..still hafto get up early...tennis at 8:30 > hmmm...kimmy..william lele..mussa and jason had a lil run round in their cars today...mussas sO crazy..cutting everyone off XD jason hung back behind everyone..never got to feel the real power of his car =( a big congrats goes to kwoka!! got ya red p's!! =D  heres my testimony im going to read out on saturday:  Throughout my childhood, I never had the opportunity to go church or really knew anything about God. I first encountered God when I was about 9 or 10, just through reading books and watching tv, and I don’t know why but whenever I needed something, or wanted something to happen, I would just pray and ask God to help me. And almost every time he would come through for me, as long as my intentions were correct. Sometimes not in the way I expected, but he would still be there to bless and help me in an even better way. I think this dependence of God, made it a lot easier for me to commit my life to him 2 years ago, since I already knew he existed, and I was eager to learn more about and to serve him.   I used to be a really anxious person, always looking for a source of security in my life, but now that I have God I know that I will always be taken care of. As it says in 1Peter 5:7, “Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you”, and it’s true, because I know that as long as I've done my part, God will always do the rest. It’s a really good thing because it’s made me a lot more relaxed person.  Also last year my school results exceeded what I could ask or expect. It shows how if you put all your trust in God you will be blessed beyond what you can imagine. So I thank and praise God for always being with me to guide me and to make all the troubles and problems I face so small.

       (BoA - ID; Peace B)  she actually looks aight in this vid..although a lil retarded at the end =P  2 test back today...not so good =/ i knew i stuffed both the tests i had on the tuesday up badly... oh well...at least 2u was aight... failed 3u..and chem wasnt that good as well > 1 mistake cost me friggen 3 marks  hmmm..all these people going to do adfa...just cos your results aint going so well atm...theres still alot more time to get your act together... sucha waste of time..i swear...why would you wanna go down to canberra to do a uni course...and then hafto stay at the base for the amount of time your course took plus a year... biggest waste of time...only good things are you get paid..and you get a job at the end of it... but it still doesnt mean its any good...unless your planning to be a soldier boy...or if theres a course they do there that no university offers...which i doubt... you would come back to sydney at 24 if you do a 3 year arts course...total waste of time...would be a lot more productive here...even if you go to a not so good uni... the job they give you at the end of adfa aint no different to any other job you would get yourself...theres no guarantee that it'll be a stable job... the qualifications that you might receive are prolly a lil unique...but you could prolly earn alot more qualifications elsewhere... i dont think youre allowed off base for the first year...and then after that...you might only get weekends off...really is such a waste of time... and youve still gottta get a decent UAI...from 75s to the 80s...not to mention the interview...medical..physical and IQ tests you gotta do just to get in... i reckon the stress..effort and time taken from trying to do well in getting into adfa would only deter you from your normal studies... mmm..maybe its just me...dont wanna see all you guys leaving sydney =)

Personality Test  You're An Obeserver You are an indispensable equalizer amongst the various groups that comprise your life. You feel that the spotlight and center stage were made for other people to act out their fantasies. That means you're one of the more kind-hearted people around. You are unusually intuitive, and you probably understand yourself, as well as others. That also means you're a good mediator — though you may prefer to spend more quiet time on your own than most.  Because of the self-knowledge you already possess, you are better equipped than many to steer your life in the right direction. Understanding more about the components of your personality will reveal unique information that even people like you might not realize. And the better you know yourself, the more confident you'll be making decisions that affect your life.   The Super IQ Test  Your thinking style is Complex Intellectual Complex Intellectuals tend to intellectualize a situation or muse about its layers of complexity and make grand-scale associations. Your Super IQ Score is 131 Your overall intelligence quotient is the result of a scientifically-tested formula based on how many questions you answered correctly. But it's only part of what we learned about you from your answers on the test. We also determined the way you process information. The way you think about things makes you a Complex Intellectual. This means you are highly intelligent and have extraordinarily strong verbal and math skills. Compared to others you are a highly conceptual and complex thinker and are able to understand information in an abstract form. You also show great attention to detail. In fact, it's hard to find something you're not good at.

tennis =/ lost every set i played *sighZ* and guess whos cut at me and pulled my net cable out at 1o3o?!?! =( i reckon i put up a good fight...lost 4 n 2 in the singles...hadto play up a seed cos morgan couldnt play...think he mightve reinjured his left wrist... ahh well..so i hadto play ben..whos like a pretty funny bloke...haha...we were both playing..heaps good when the other was playing craphouse...and fully laughing at some of the shots we came up with =P anyhooz...i came on the court with my raquet..and left it holding cairens...lol..broke the strings of both my raquets in the 2nd set =/ must be hitting the ball too hard =P hahaha..nahz...just bad luck i guess =/ andrea didnt play today..ive got some feeling shes avoiding me..lol..always pulling out..although..she is a notorious lazy bum...always turnin up 3omins late most of the time =/ hehe...at least it gave me a chance to get to know mia...hehe...i thought she was older than me..turns out shes in year 9...at st vincents...where danni was gonna 'go' =/ hehe shes such a nice lil chikka..got a coolies grunt as well =P prolly hits it harder than me half the time with that huge backswing >  hmmm..its a lil sad to see how A1 has degerated through the years..and being part of the degeneration > i remember..back when i was first joined the saturday morning junior competition..back when i wouldve been 10 or so....everyone was fully into tennis...full of energy for it...my first rep match was the annual illawarra vs southern districts challenge interdistrict thing...damn..who was in my team back then...morgan..ryan bellamy (whos the 20th under 18 junior in australia..although hes only...15 haha)...and a few guys i cant remember...haha...anyhooz..i think we got thumped in that match...i'd already been playing saturaday morning for a comp or two back then...working my way up for D grade..lol..thats how many grades there were back then...like at least 30...hehe..back then when zita was just starting to play tennis..shouldntve had stopped missy!! youve got a natural talent for sport..hehe..although you are pretty smart as well =P  i think ive been in 3 or 4 saturday morning final winning teams...and one that lost in the semis >  hmm...by then i had already playing interdistrict for a few years...i think we won quite alot of those...hehe..i never really took my tennis seriously enough..like not that extra level...so slowly saw morgan and ryan and people like them go away =(  thing i hated sO much bout interdistrict was the trials >  the selector people were weirdos anyways...never really chose on the results at the trials... i didnt play interdistrict this year...cos it takes up my whole sunday..and cos you sometimes gotta travel to places like newcastle..wollongong...blue mountains and baulkam hills... i think we missed out on the finals by about a point or two last year...hmm..mustve been the year before then..when i partnered richard in the doubles..pwoarh..we ripped it up...he was the shotmaker..and i was the consistent/fluky guy =P hahaha anyways..yea..we had heapsa fun..i think we came back from like 5-0 or something a few times...but we hadto split up..cos adrian and ryan bennett didnt get along so well..hehe..so i went back to playing with adrian...who i played with the year before that...we play pretty well together as well...that was the year i went thru undefeated in the singles =) yea...too bad adrians mum jan n ryan bennetts mum anna couldnt get along...wouldve been alot easier for everyone...got pretty nasty at one stage...mark sproule was playing back then as well...those were the days...everyone trying to make sure they werent playing or umpiring when afternoon tea was being served XD  hmmmZ..anyways..back to saturday morning..lolz...yea..like when i was a lil kiddo...hehe...back then..i was such a puddler..can actually hit the ball now =P i think we mustve played nexto the A1 peepz back then..when we were in bgrade...playing with the swifts..pete n jenny (gosh..jenny must be one of the best juniors around...well...she was...like what...winning nationals last year...a few years under her age group)..well yea...i remember watching those people and just thinking to myself...how am i ever gonna get into A1...yaknow..they were hitting the ball so well and it was all like pro stuff...hehe..i think i got there in...99 or 2ooo..i did pretty good in the first comp..and went shithouse in the 2nd...and i think i got dropped in the 3rd..hadto work my way back in A2 for a season...came back..ripped it up that comp..and yea..been playing pretty consistently the last few comps to where i am now..now..its...so bad > mumis lil sister was having a convo while playing her match..A1 looks so poor now...blah...alot of the seious people are too old..or...especially the guys arent interested anymore...well..most of the chicks arent interested..so the ones that get into A1 are pretty serious bout it...anyhooz..thisll prolly be my last comp...dont think we'll make the finals...our 3rd seeds are losing a lil too much...and i aint winning that many of my matches..and people keep on dogging... i think A1 might have a lil trouble finding decent matchups next comp...cos alot of people are dropping out..iunno...i guess..cant be bothered getting up early in the mornings on saturday anymore...burnt out from the 7 or so years ive done it... i do enjoy the game..love playing it and watching it...just iunno..sometimes...just cbb anymore...and i pretty much hate singles...i think im a much better singles player...but doubles is where all the fun is =P people just bitch bout ryan bennett now..lol...hes kinda geting what he deserves...gosh..so much of a cheater at times...lotta the guys wanna deck him XD hmm...i reckon ive pretty much fulfilled my tennis 'career' lol...been winning a trophy or something like that every year since 97...beaten someone 6-0 6-0..worst loss is prolly a 6-1 6-0...had something like tennis elbow before...that was when i could barely hit a ball without pain running up through my arm...and when i had the thing with my knee...once where it just felt whacked out..and i was limpin at times...and the other time where being the klutz i am tripped...or fell on the court and took a chunk of skin off my knee..back 2 years ago..scar still hasnt fully healed...been to a few pro tennis matches...the adaidas open...seen kournikova on the court ;) went to the olympic tennis matches...guess ive pretty much had it all...oh yea...only thing is prolly not winning a big tournment..but i never gave myself a chance to do that...and i guess...well...maybe i wasnt meant to win one...well..was kinda thinkin bout maybe going into a few tournments at the end of the year when the hsc is over...but its so weird...i used to be like the youngest playing in tournments and competitions..but now..im like an ancient bum outta my leauge > kinda regretting not taking tennis seriously...maybe if i did...wouldnt hafto deal with this hsc crap...or..at least make it easier =P hehehe..at least i might be able to say ive played whoever...if someone like ryan bellamy or cameron..or morgan get up there into the pros  hmmm..couldntve mised much there...prolly havent really talked bout the behind the scenes bitching and schemin thats gone on....but yea..thats pretty much my tennis career...cant remember that much of what happened when i was young though... oh..coaches...hmm...first coach was greg something..lol...he was aight...but pretty much just a kids coach...wait no..i went to this other thing..but that was for n00bie people..and i could already hit forehands and stuff back then so i changed to greg...although he back stabbed me a few years later cos i left him to go to greg perkins...apparently a top notch coach..never worked that well with him..never clicked i guess...yea i guess hes really good at what he does...and he did teach me quite a bit..but i never really improved that much with him...and then...we went to todd clark..arguably my most favourite coach..gosh...he was like my mentor back then...i improved the most when he was my coach..made tennis really fun...i think there was one time i got him cut..cos i was too shit...and i was fkn cut at myself for letting him down > havent seen him anywhere near as much these as i would like these few years.. after he left...hadto go back to perkins..where i started to suck again..lol..thats about when i got dropped...but we met adrian then..and he let us know bout dean toparis his coach.. and my coach now...hes prolly my other favourite coach...his goal wouldve been to get me back into A1...and yea..he did that..hes the one whos gotten me to keep on improving..i mean..i didnt really have a real 2nd serve when i came to him...but ive got (modestly) one of the best first n second serves in A1...and ive pretty much gotten better in every part of my game...hes always saying that i could be real 'dangerous' if i played more tennis O.o what does that mean..lol...that i can hurt people?!?! =P its been a long road...issit gonna end soon??...  hehe..wow..this has been a long blogg... oh yeaaaa..already said it..but its amys bday today..happy bday =)

       (Christina Milian - Someday One Day) Day to day and each night I pray that this ends  That there's someone out there that's gonna melt my heart away And take me to another place From the loneliness that's driving me insane  I get so cold summer feels like the winter When I'm at home, all alone I just cry I wish that I could just lie like I'm happy But I can't hide this hurt inside  But I tell you someday I'm gonna find A guy that's gonna change my life And I tell you one day just wait and see True love is waiting out there for me  I'm like an open book just trying to turn the page Feels like I'm trapped in a maze trying to find my way Oh my heart's yearning for someone to call my own And I don't wanna sing another sad love song again  I get so cold summer feels like the winter And not a full moon of gloom that just cried? I wish that I could just lie like I'm happy But I can't hide this hurt inside  Take me away, away Far away, away Take me away So far away, away  Someday  uh...yea =)  everyone is totally weird today =/ somepeople are talking bout the weirdest stuff...like alex n changy..and then shero n everyone else in the channel tonight...and sezza n lawren =S  okay...im tired...really tired..been tired all day..been bumming round all day...dont wanna do anything..havent done anything...well...we went to kfc during the free period...and...someone stole a footy today..im kinda limping round atm..knee hurts real bad =/  oh...congrats with tam gettin his ps...uh..well i think you did...can never tell with you =/

       (SugaBabes - Run For Cover) When blues, got me down Then I, get turned around I tend to, cut myself off From things, I shouldn't run from  It doesn't really matter Sometimes we run for cover I'm always on the outside  Stabbed me in the back Wanted things that I lack Sticking to your ploy Is this something you enjoy? Publicity and insecurity  Just wanna be me It's my need to be free  It doesn't really matter Sometimes we run for cover I'm always on the outside (on my own) You never seem to wonder How much you make me suffer I speak it from the inside  Looking right at me (at me) Won't receive my plea (my plea) Tell me what you mean (you mean) I'm not what's on the screen (oh-oh) Faking what will be (will be)  Fighting the fatigue (fatigue) That's quite enough for me (for me) Makes me wanna scream (scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream)  Keep it to myself (Keep it to myself)   *sighZ* tomorrow beings my study reigme for the trials n hsc...and if i start slacking off please tell me off and get me back to work >  its something that ive noticed for awhile now...and i kinda fully realised it yeaterday at the jap day...its that the friends that i have...no matter if your close or not...you guys are still true..and are really my friends and help me through my problems..knowingly and unknowingly..other thing ive realised is that the friends i have now...are totally different from the ones i had in year 7...dont even hafto ask bout primary school since i live so far away from punchbowl and everyone back then had no idea how precious friends can be...well..ive still got contact with one primary school friend =)  but yea..besides my all time best buddy shero...who was my first friend back in 7-Green..ahh..back then...first lesson we had...sat nexto each other in owens's class...and just hit it off from there..haha..we've changed quite a bit from then i guess...not so nerdish...lol not my fault we were stuck in the skips n nerd azn class > blah...no offence to the nerds..but seriously...im kinda glad we leftem..cos iunno..sometimes it just seems that theyre friends with you only so they can leech info n notes n stuff off you...the friendship feels so fake?? iunno..maybe im wrong...but thats just how i feel...oh..and i really think playing handball in year 10 onwards is pretty lame ^^; haha..and skola...he was the dude that followed me and shero round the first days of year7...guess cos he didnt fit in with the skips cos hes kind aboish n czech  n some other weirdish mix..haha...used to go to his place heaps...but then all changed in year 8 when he decided to do german and hadto split into different classes...and now hes the chief breaker in the school =P  hmmMMmm..anyhooz...year 8..that was when we got jipped..and me shero jason n gavin got shoved into the skip class once AGAIN..8 yellow...that was like the start of the love-hate thing me and jason had...we loved to hate each other...ahaha...he was sO damn obnoxious n stuck up back then..and i couldnt take it > lol..i think i was a pretty big dickhead back then as well...got on his nerves alot...didnt mean he hadto punch me n shit..just cos i was small back then...could still fight above my weight *hmph* =P years 9 n 10...hmmMmmm...the elective years..everyone was everywhere lol...but i found that one lil korean was in alot of my classes..mark minsoo kim aka karkass...lol..those were heaps fun times...hes like sucha quirky n disgusting guy...always had weird korean games to play in class...always finding something to talk bout...always being funny..always farting XD lol..he was always a good bitch buddy...haha...he intro'd me to his lil korean buddies...who would be in yr 10 now...daniel...mark...james =) thats when we populated asia as well..haha...roughhouse soccer there...so many people got grazes from the ashphalt...i remember we were allowed to play..until we upgraded from the tennisball to the soccerball and broke a window or two...lol XD thats when i met simon n roden...roden was in my english class back in year 9...  anyhooz...yea...years 11 and 12 have kinda been where asias been a lil divided..theres all these lil groups..the viets..the koreans...us..the more err..techie chinks??

well...i guess i shouldve maybe expected it...but yea...anyways..i think catherina or monica/penny mustve called..and then switched over to jaery...keuns wife..so that wouldve been 2nd aunts daughter in law...shes korean..but thats another story..anyhooz...yea...so shes like..is mum home?? is dad home?? but i dont think she could hold it any long and couldnt wait...was already sniffling and stuff...and yea...she was like 'porpor has passed away'...porpor as in her mum in law..but yea...once i heard her voice i knew it was something bad..but to actually hear the words...just really stunned me...and she told me to pass on the news...and she hung up pretty soon after...could hear her crying and stuff =( well...after i put the phone down...i was shot...couldnt study anymore...just kinda sat at the comp...just looking..staring out into nothing...didnt even go outside to tell dad... and then..when mum called home..at 3:00..i totally jumped outta my seat..and when i took the phonecall...she sounded asif she was having too much fun with samuel and audrey..so i couldnt tell her there and then...eventually went down to tell dad bout it...and then aunt may called at like 3:11...cos gran lives with her and all..just rang to see if we knew and stuff... mum came home at like...3:3oish...and i told her...in front of samuel and audrey...the silence was sO bad..mum was in shock i think...we all expected it to happen soooner or later...but just not today...it was always gonna be...tomorrow..or the week after...or the week after that... and yea..she had her cry..went straight over to 3rd aunts to spend time with grandma...  i reallyREALLY hate phonecalls atm...nothing good seems to come from them...and i dont ever wanna hafto tell people something like that ever again >  i dont think that...her death hit me straight away...i didnt understand it...i didnt accept it...it just didnt sink in till after..during the night...i was like...im never ever gonna be able to see her again..never be able to talk to her...never again...and that sinking feeling in your heart...yea...i felt that...even now when i think bout it...its like my hearts just sunk a lil bit...gotten a lil heavier... but..i still sotra feel guilty?? cos...even after all this...ive laughed...ive had times of joy...ive had people make me feel better (and i love every single one of youse *hugZ*)...ive smiled... ive had time to not think about it...but...i know that theres people that this event wont ever has scarred forever...that theyll never be able to get over this pain...never be able to stop feeling it...like her husband...whos practically devoted the last 17years to her health...her 4 sons...her 2 daughters in law...her mum..heard grandma didnt eat at all after hearing bout it...her siblings...  i guess in a sense...im glad that im not living in hk...cos at least im not filled with all this in my face every day for the next few weeks...but there are people who will...my uncles...my aunties...my cousins...thoughts n love n wishes go out to all you guys...   (Boys II Men & Mariah Carey - One Sweet Day) Sorry I never told you All I wanted to say And now it's too late to hold you 'Cause you've flown away So far away  Never had I imagined Living without your smile Feeling and knowing you hear me It keeps me alive Alive  And I know you're shining down on me from heaven Like so many friends we've lost along the way And I know eventually we'll be together One sweet day  Darling I never showed you Assumed you'd always be there I took your presence for granted But I always cared And I miss the love we shared  Although the sun will never shine the same again I'll always look to a brighter day Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep You will always listen as I pray  Sorry I never told you All I wanted to say     And I know you're shining down on me from heaven    what am i supposta be feeling atm?? its like...im sad...but...i havent shed a tear...i really dunno whats going on... mum went to work today..she didnt really wanna...and was supposta have a half day...but i guess to get some normalilty back in her life...  well...today was actually okay...the trials really werent that hard...well...in my opinion..everyone saud that they died =/ does that mean that im so stupid that i dont even know how stupid i am?? XD anyhooz...english was up first...area of study..so it was all the journey stuff...the english tests now...everyone knows whats gonna be in it...its just a matter of remodelling and reshaping the essays youve written in class to fit into the question...  had a calming down kinda thing at the start...at first...they gave the whole 'mobile-phones-are-banned-if-yours-rings-during-the-exam-we-can-fail-you-so-get-up-turn-them-off-and-puttem-in-your-bag' speech...and i swear..half the grade got up and out of their seats to go to their bags XD hahahah..anyways..after everyone was seated back...big debbie demitriadis was like 'i hope you all know your student numbers..two boys have already run out to see theirs'... *tam puts his hand up* 'is it the one we had during the last assessment?' big d: 'no there are new ones' *tam shits his pants* 'can i please go and check mine?' *he gets up and runs out..so do another 40 ppl* hahahahaha nearly got myself into a spot of bother before the test even started..after i pulled out my bag of starburst babies...i kinda ripped it too much and the packet was half open..sO scared..thought it was gonna fall all over the ground..lucky it didnt =)  so yea...the first part..section I...given stimulus material...and hafto answer questions on it...the stimulus material were bitches..a picture of a guy walking on a road...a article bout a couple moving to a country town...a crappy poem....pretty poor examples..especially for inner journey which is what im used to doing...thats what made it hard i guess...i wrote like...2 and half pages on that...did that in bout 30mins...everyones written like 3 or more...hopefully its only cos i write smaller than everyone...but yea...i mean...you dont need to spend so much time on a 2-5 mark questions... section II...creative writing...  write a diary entry using either 'drifting' or 'tunnel' as your stimulus  ...well...i already had a creative writing task...a short story...so anyways..i kinda just adapted that to it..it still works cos its in the first person and all..just has a lil more imagery and stuff than a normal diary entry response...there was a word limit on it so my 2 n half pages there was like perfect..and got it done in the allocated 40mins...just hope the content is aight and the marker doesnt say i wrote a narrative instead... and then...the last section..section III...  'journeys are valuable' - use this quote as a stimulus...referring to your core text...one text from the bos stimulus booklet and various texts of your own choosing'  pretty lucky it was a straight out essay..anyways...i wrote 4 pages...which is heaps for me and my tinified writing...my hand ached so bad after it...but it was a sense of achievement that made it aight =) anyways...i covered the question pretty well..it was just like a practice one i'd done before...did my core text..bos...and 2 of my own... hehe..i had 50mins to do i...10more than usual and finished the essay with about a minute to go ^^  when i got outta there..was surprised how sO many people were like 'omg that was so freaking hard %$^*&@#$@' and mark was fully freaking like 'omg thats the worst test ive ever done in my life..i failed it so badly...i wanna die' =/ but yea..i sorta calmed him down a lil...ah well...we had like 20mins till our jap speaking tests...all 9 of us were in the library..i ended up being 3rd last..behind TETS!! the friggen half jap mofo that is smoooOOOooooth as in jap... ahh well...this is tip for all you youngsters...at school...the few minutes before an exam..there is very little chance you can actually study..should just have lil notes with formulas...cos indepth stuff...wont go into your brain...unless you can find a quiet place by yourself... anyways..we were all there in the library...being pretty loud...abO abson was conducting the tests in the seminar rooms...no one was studying so we took out the chess set and had some fun...haha..i actually beat someone in chess XD against the even n00ber mark hahaha and there was this time where abO was kinda talking to umm...dean..and she was emphasising something...moving her head all round..this was after the speaking exam...like she had a lil bit of time to talk over what we could improve on and what we should expect at the hsc speaking on saturday...so yea...shes moving her head and all...and i take a peak over...and im talking to mark and ibby..and imitating her..i take one glance back into the window..and she was talking..but her eyes were on me glaring XD hahaha ah well...when it was time for me to go in..it was all sweet =P hehe..had the whole calming thing down by a lil chitchat at the start...and then did the speaking test..it REALLY went by fast...she said it was like 9mins at least...but i thought we only went for like 4 =D test was scary though..started off with the easy stuff like..talking bout ur family...what you do at school...then it went onto hobbies and stuff...and she started to ask bout music and stuff..and i was all thinking 'nonononono dont gO there girlfriend XD' haha..and yea...she went onto something else thankfully *sigh of relief* i stopped and stuttered alot > ah well..at least i understood most of the questions...just dunno how its gonna be infront of someone totally new and unknown to me =/ i think i mightve lagged it abit cos the debriefing part kinda got sidetracked...lol...was talking bout the dragons win on friday night =P  kinda sad to see jason atm..hes really down now that ruths gone...he said that she went at the 'worst possible time' but yea...im really feeling for him atm...he might be going to see the councillor tomorrow?? =/ hmm...hope he really gets better...long distance relationships can work...so if they really try..itll work =)  i reckon im sO dead for the eco and chem tests...although im a lil confident for the 2u test tomorrow =) better get to study ^^

       (Usher - Burn) I dont understand why  See it's burning me to hold onto this I know this is something I gotta do But that don't mean I want to What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just  I feel like this is coming to an end And it's better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you I gotta let it burn  It's gonna burn for me to say this But it's comin from my heart It's been a long time coming But we done been fell apart Really wanna work this out But I don't think you're gonna change it I do but you don't Think it's best we go our separate ways Tell me why I should stay in this relationship When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with I think that you should let it burn  When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to Even though this might bruise you Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you Hate the thought of ever being with someone else But you know that it's over We know that it's through Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to Got somebody here but I want you Cause the feelin ain't the same Find myself callin' her your name Ladies tell me do you understand?
