      There was a letter in the mail today for Mike(y).  He picked it up from his mailbox and read it in the dimly lit parking lot, car on and tunes playing in the background.  It was from a girl he knows all too well and not at all.  He was happy that it got to him, though a bit surprised. It's been a while since he's received a personal letter in the old school, had written format.  From the letter, there were a few questions that presented themselves, and following are the answers to them:   -The side nearest to the door but preferably the left side of it. -Mike(y) thinks everyone snores, it just depends on how tired they are.  How loudly they do is another matter.   He doesn't snore(too loudly), but he does grind his teeth and talk a bit. -He does, but it's usually lightly sweetened things; dark chocolates are always welcomed. -He's not really that picky an eater.  Ill prepared foods are the foods he cannot stand to eat. -A milk carton, some tea (unsweetened) in a pitcher, a bottle of malibu rum, batteries, and some four-cheese blend left over from a failed attempt at stuffed mushrooms.  Note: He thinks shitakes should never be stuffed. -There's no particular order to them.  Just what he thinks would be visually appealing.   Symmetry plays a part in it.   He never really thought about any of the questions before, at least not consciously, but now he finds them amusing.  Endearing even.  He's thankful for the fact that she's helped him to stop and smell the proverbial "roses."  At this, she never fails.  Maybe that's why he loves her.  He thinks that's part of it.

      Charlie once told me that he was the worst best friend a guy could have.  I disagreed, mostly because I think that a two-legged dog with cataracts would make a worst best friend.  But now I think I'll be usurping that role...Maybe.  Here's the deal:  I don't do cards, regardless of the occassion.  No reason really, except for the fact that I cannot mail them off in a timely fashion.  Case in point:  five years ago, I spent roughly 50 bucks on birthday, holiday(I'm Catholic, so just those ones), and other special ordeal cards.  I never mailed any of them.  I forget birthdays(Sorry everybody) and anniversaries( Ask Mom & Dad.)  I also don't call too often.  Of course, the price of overseas calls, originating in Japan, doesn't help that.  And presents...fugghedaboutit.  I just take people for granted.  There, I said it.  I hate that I do, but it happens.  Often.  I just try to bank on the fact that those people I know and love don't need to hear from me too often.  Mind you, everyone who means anything to me is thought about on a regular basis.  Daily even.  I know I'm lousy at keeping up with people.  I'm just glad they've stuck with me all this time.  For this I offer my thanks.  Having said that, I think I'll go ahead and take the role.  Soory pooch, but -mike(y)'s got this.

      I am not an insomniac.  It's only midnite here in Tokyo proper and in the past 7 days, I have had my weak.  Don't worry, the spelling was intentional. Have a little imagination will you.  Four years ago, my how time hastens, I was diagnosed with hypomania.  For those not in the know, the definition reads something like this: Hypomania is a mood state which like mania is characterized by persistent and pervasive elated or irritable mood, and behaviors and thoughts that are consistent with such a mood state. It is distinguished from mania by the absence of psychotic symptoms and less impact of functioning. Hypomanic Episodes occur in some Mood Disorders.  Mania may be thought of loosely as the opposite of depression (Thank gawd for that line, my saving grace). It is characterized by elated, euphoric or irritable mood and increased energy. The term may refer to a mental disorder or to a mood state or symptom and is associated with Bipolar Disorder. [Bipolar Mood Disorders are characterized by dramatic "mood swings" or episodes of Mania, Hypomania...]  The brackets are for effect.  I hope I didn't waste my time.    Pretty effing vague if you ask me.  But you didn't and you're still reading this, so stay with me just a bit longer.  I wouldn't look at is as a justification for my state.  I am not "certifiable."  I have nothing to be depressed about, really.  Everyone has bad days.  I just have them a bit more often.    My mind does not stop.  It's a hundred-miles-a-minute in a donut of a wind tunnel complete with obstacle course.  Hurdles, ladders, ropes, dips, water hazards, and bunkers.  I feel like a participant in one of those Japanese game shows where I do believe the whole point of the game is to hurt yourself badly in front of a paying audience.  Of course I don't get a prize at the end.  But I think you're getting my drift.  Is there apoint to all this?  I hope so.  Maybe I'm rambling so I can say that I actually do things while I'm killing time.  Just don't tell my shrink.  I fired him after six months of "treatment."  Should have filed a malpractice suit. The savage.  Everyone involved seems to focus on a depression of sorts.  I don't get it.  I've never had sui..... thoughts.  That's just silly.  Thoughts much frowned upon by me.  The closest thing that's crossed my mind would be skydiving naked in the Arctic with a jetpack strapped to see if the boys could make it. What a show for the polar bears. Call it my sense of adventure, not depression.  I, on the other hand, think that I've got it made.  Sure I'm a few pounds over my "goal" weight, but there's a girl who loves me in Seattle(and I love her), my family, and three of the greatest best friends any m-f-er could ever be blessed with.  Throw in the money enough for beer, puffy treats, and eats, and I my friend am a happy man.    The only issue is that I just can't sleep.  Go figure.

      There was a time when I was living in Guam when I thought that my friends would never leave me.  That we would all grow old in some gated community and all our children's children's children would live on to carry on that tradition.  I was naive.  I was six.  Now, some 19 years later, all I do is wonder how the hell I could have ever thought up suck malarky.  I was six.  Now I am 25.  Now I am a transient.  In the last six years, I have lived in seven different locations.  All for varying lenghts of time, and all with experiences all their own.  Every friend I've made a reflection of a friend I've passed by.  Paining me all the while.  If I were to classify myself as a victim, it would have to be one of circumstance.  Of Situational friendships.  If.  But I think its just a right of passage for anyone riding through this wild farce we cal history a decade from now.  Do I relish it? Sort of.  Case in point:  I met a bud here, and in two weeks I've never felt closer to anyone than I have him.  Well, Mish and Charlie and Marcelo, but that's another story all together.  His name's BirdDawg (note:the names have been changed to protect the innocent.)  I call him Brother.    It's odd, that in such short a time, folks can become so hip to one another.  That things would gel so easily/quickly is uncanny.  Will it last?  Ask me at my funeral.  I'll have nothing else better to do but discuss it.  Though, by no means am I trying to trivialize the "bonds" I've built with all the folks I've met over the years.  In fact, I wouldn't trade them for anything.  Not even for a buffalo nickel in the middle of a thousand-fold harem surrounded by dromedaries high on crank.  Scout's honor.    It's just that with each pass, I feel like the Enterprise in an episode of Star Trek where Captain Kirk's just told Scottie that he wants the shields up to full capacity.  Except the d. crystals are out.  So they have to ride.  It's upsetting, frustrating, fun and odd for me to see people pass by as I do.  But I think that's what makes it worth it.  Not knowing.  Yet banking on the truism that we've all got the rest of our lifetimes to meet up again.  Good Times.  It's my addiction: making lifetime friends on such short notice.  Then leaving again.  Looking back when I want to, just never stopping to stare.  Think about it and keep these words in mind:****** ** ***.  I think its password protected.

      Here I am in a country not so foreign.  But at the same time all the more bewildering.  I don't like it here, but work set me off on this rock to do what I do best.  The worst part is that today I asked to stay an extra year on top of my original sentence.  Stupid? Maybe.  All I know is that everything I've ever done in this lifetime has been because I was unsure about the consequences.  There's that word again.  Such an all-encompassing term that's just plain garbage in the ears of a man like me.  Again, what do I care?  Maybe I'm an optimist.  Maybe I'll start to like being the only brown-skinned asian round-eye who cannot read a lick of Nihongo(s/p).  Then's there this recent liking that I've had to the song Mekong, by the Refreshments.  Almost pathetic that that song describes just about everything I've been up to recently.  Including the 15,000 miles bit.

      I used to never really think about the weather and how it plays into my everyday affairs.  Even reading about the weather in books used to bother the bejeezus out of me.  Today, you can say I had an epiphany of sorts.  Maybe that's not the word I'm looking for, but it'll do.  It's damn chilly here and I'm a bit bummed.  Maybe it's this pending trip I have to take to a place I can't talk about.  Not sure, but I'll blame it on the effing drab weather.    Growing up on the island, you just never had to worry about bad weather too often.  Yeah, we have more typhoons than you can shake the proverbial stick at, but you just get used to those.  This crap here, with the 8-12 degree Celsius ordeals going for it just gets me aggro'd.  Nothing can be gained from cursed temperatures such as these...Eskimo's are retarded.

      Today was the first time, in quite a long one, that I have actually prayed.  Silly?  Yeah.  But don't worry, I'm not going to proceed with the bible thumping or anything like that.  I just thought I'd put a blurb in here about it.  I feel pretty nifty.  And to those whom I said a few words about, I hope all goes well.  The weekend was quiet.  The usual:  Fun schtuff with a touch of shenanigans. Aye.

      I don't have cable or a dish in Tokyo.  I watch movies and read books and drink beer.  Of course there's the ever present porn on the computer, but that's about it.    I've been here in Texas for since last Saturday and I have a TV complete with your standard 65 channels.  I perused the channels to see what I've been missing.  And for this I think I feel a bit dumb.    The old joys: MTV, VH1, and the Food Network are still there, but I think they've been perverted.  The Cartoon Network, once a welcomed favorite just down right...Blows!  And what's with all the "reality" shows?  Savagery.  Thank goodness I have a book here to fall back on.  And the ever present Hustler rag.  Gawd bless the USA!

      I'm in Texas right now.  San Angelo (best said with a southern accent) at that.   I've only been here for a few days and only be here for a few days more.  Time enough to let the jetlag set in right as I get back to Tokyo.  Yay!  I'm taking a Fiber-Optics course that's a little lame, really.  It's a breeze.  They threw in some networking lessons, but I don't really think that helps me much.  Think of it as I do.  It's kind of like first learning to ride a bike.  My brother was there forcing me to do something I didn't want to do.  It was at a cemetery near where I grew up.  I hated the experience.  Especially the scrapes and the nut-banging that ensued when I hit a wall full speed.  Okay, maybe it's not at all like that.  Maybe I'm quibbling.  I see this class as something I have to do, but that I'd be perfectly content not caring about because, like learning to ride a bike, I could die happy not happening upon it.  The only thing I'm happy about is that I got to get a nice steak salad and little snippets of southern accents that I get to mimic.    Silly I know, but that's how I like to keep it.

      I was on the phone earlier tonite with the girl I love...we got into a conversation on this upcoming "vacation" that I have to take for work.  She's a bit worried about where I'll be going.  Basically what might happen to me while I'm there...  For me, it's old hat.  I just see it as another thing I have to do.  Then there's the braggin' rights that come along with heading off to "destination unknown."  -Typical male? Yes.  But that's what being set on this planet with a satchel affords me.  Right, wrong or indifferent.  So now I feel like a jackass.  Can I use the "I'll never understand women" card? Gawd I wish I could!  I just have a whole diferent perspective on it.  This trip of mine was inevitable and, well, cyclical in that I'll have to do it again and again.  Get my drift?  So I can't dread what might happen or else that would leave me pretty bummed...everytime I have to do it.  I've met guys out there who sulk their whole tour.  I cannot afford myself that travesty.  (A) its not healthy, and (B) as noted, I have a satchel.  I hope she understands me.  Because I want her to be there for me when I get back, and for the rest of my time on this planet.    On an upnote: I think that was our first "misunderstanding" in six years.  I think our relationship is growing. Let the record show that only I would think of that as a good thing.  I am a schmuck, but a rather goofy one.

      Ever date someone for a while and then one day realize that you have no clue as to the names of her parents?  Me neither, until about five minutes ago.  Call me stupid, but it never came up.  I think.    I don't think I'm too bad a person for not knowing those details.  Am I?  Hell, I know a guy who dated a girl for a month and never got her name.  He called her "Bob" the whole time they were together.  She booted him when he finally asked.  Me, I think I'll be alright.  Matter of fact, I think I'll call her to find out.  Right now...  ...Pascual & Marilen.  'Nuff said.

      Last week I got my flu shot.  Then there was the Anthrax and Smallpox treatments that I needed to get prior to going on vacation.  I guess I'm a walking biological problem.  Don't drink the night you get the shots, unless you like whacky dreams.  Intense, surreal and downright ridiculous ones.  Okay, drink.  My smallpox is itchy.  Just thought I'd share that.

      We have rules in the military that have to be followed.  Some of them are odd.  For instance, getting a blowjob from my girlfriend is a criminal offense.  Actually getting a hummer from anyone, even one's wife, is a punishable offense. Although I do think that one's excusable, easily swept under the rug.  Some rules I just don't get.  The one that bothers me here is the "no pr0n" rule.  I don't see why my right to look at a naked woman has to be set aside while I defend my country in a hostile environment.    Do you get it?  If you do, drop me a line...

      I'm on my "vacation" now.  I can't say where, but I'll leave you with a few hints.  It's one word, 11 letters long and ends in "tan."  Or you can click here:  urlLink This is not where I'm at!   I hope everyone's had Happy Holidays and a Spankin' New Year.  I had fireworks.  They weren't welcome, but we had them anyway.  I don't mind it.  Yeah, there's the possibility that I could not make it back...it happens; Just like some folks don't make it back from a night out.  If it's my time, then so be it.  Macabre, ain't I?  Let me digress though.  It's dusty here and the guy I work with is a putz, but it's not as bad as the media makes it out to be.  There's even Surf & Turf on Fridays.  The cool thing is that every time I get stuck in a place like this, it helps me to appreciate the little things in life.  Take silverware for instance.  We can't get 'em here.  Not even soft TP.  I miss soft TP.  Gawd bless Cottonelle(TM).    My bum hurts.

      Two nights ago, at least I think it was, I heard gunfire.  Actually, I heard a lot of gunfire.  There were fifty caliber rounds being shot and what would amount to modern day cannons going off.   It all started right around bedtime for me; midnight, thereabouts.  I couldn't tell if it was hostile or otherwise.  Well, I don't think I bothered to differentiate.  As a matter of fact, I was a tad bit aggravated at the fact that all parties involved decided to throw this shindig so late in the evening.  Savages!  The only thought running through my head was, "I hope I can sleep through this?"  And you know what...I did.  Woohoo!

      About a week ago from yesterday, I was in an old Russian state/province.  So, there we were, Dasher, 3D, Z, Timmy, and me.  We were pretty bored having left Afghanistan the nite before and not having anything to truly keep us preoccupied.    Don't even get me started on that whole  "Well, what about conversation?"  crap either.  After hanging out with anyone for over 32 hours, the last thing you want to do  is "talk." Aye?   So we started throwing rocks at each other.  Yep, rocks.    It was a new low-brow point in my life, but holy balls was it a lot of fun.  I'd recommend to it any adults out there.  Go ahead, beam somebody today.

      I feel retarded for not mentioning this, but I think I need to get it out of my system.  &nbsp;  I broke up with the girl I love. [Tear. ( and I'm not doing it to be a wise-ass. )]  &nbsp;  I just want us to be friends, and yeah, it sounds selfish, but it's the one thing I want to allow myself.&nbsp; I don't think I could ever handle a relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; I can't be the guy she wants to spend the rest of her life with because I can't bear the responsibility.&nbsp; I'm not the marrying type and I'll never be.&nbsp; It's a philosophical thing that I still need to figure out, but that I'm perfectly content with brushing aside for the moment.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I know I'm being cryptic, but it's not intentional.&nbsp; I just don't think I have the mental capacity to quantify what the hell I want to say (or, rather, the heart.)&nbsp; That's the Gawd's Honest, Hand-on-Bible-with-one-in-the-air, I-Shat-You-Not, truth.   She made me feel guilty for the things I've said over the years.&nbsp; But I'll take that.&nbsp; In my defense, I meant every word of it then and I won't deny them.&nbsp; You can see it in the posts, that's proof enough. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I don't blame her for being angry.&nbsp; Heck, I think I'd congratulate her&nbsp;if I ever&nbsp;grow a pair enough to call her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; I love her ( always will ).&nbsp; I am not in love with her.&nbsp; For that I apologize.&nbsp;   I took the "rose-colored glasses" off and I don't know what else to say.&nbsp;  I don't know why. &nbsp;   Mais pour que ma décision soit égoïste, je ne pense pas que je la regretterai jamais.&nbsp; Croyez-moi, je ne peut pas.

      Holy bejeezus!&nbsp; I just got off the phone with an old friend who I haven't heard from in ages.&nbsp; I like the fact that we were able to talk like there was never any time loss between meetings.&nbsp; I think it's an inherent trait that I have.   We talked about my relationships that I've had over the years, and he helped me to understand something:&nbsp; That I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with the rest of my life.   Granted I've been aware of this from day one, but I'm glad for it.&nbsp; And now that I've beaten around the bush, here's what I'm trying to get at; I don't want to be responsible for anyone on this trip.&nbsp; I don't think I could live with the burden of wrecking someone else's ride just because I don't have everything mapped out.&nbsp;   You know, I think I've made this point elsewhere in this blog, but I don't care.&nbsp; I'll not deal with lost luggage or bad accommodations.&nbsp; I don't want to compromise myself.    Though I think I need a beer before the drive ...

      I just got off of leave.&nbsp; Yep.&nbsp; I think I'm still on a rush.&nbsp; For the first time, I actually miss home.&nbsp; I do. &nbsp; Sure, family should be enough of a reason to miss it, but there was so much more to it this time around.&nbsp; I met up with so many people I never thought I'd see again and got a chance to play catch up with a few I'd been hoping to run into all these years.&nbsp; Then there are the ones whom I never thought I'd get to meet in this lifetime. &nbsp; I just never felt so "at home" on Guam until this time around.&nbsp; Man what a treat!&nbsp; It's like a sugar rush.&nbsp; Bittersweet as it may be, but I was never a big fan of candy to begin with. &nbsp; To everyone back home, all I can say is, "Thank you.&nbsp; It has been my privilege, my honor; and I am fortunate because of you." &nbsp; I'll be back as soon as I can.&nbsp; Until then, lieben Sie meinen Affen.  (Ahh zee Germans. What a riot!)
