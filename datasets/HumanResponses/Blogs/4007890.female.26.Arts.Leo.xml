      I'm listening to Bedouin Soundclash... what an incredibly talented group of guys.&nbsp; I was introduced to them at Hillside last night.&nbsp; They have their own style of reggae and the lead singer's voice is very Bob Marley-esque.&nbsp; They had everyone up on their feet last night.&nbsp; I only wish I didn't have to leave to find my friend Rob halfway through their set.&nbsp; I got back just as they were finishing their second last song.  I discovered that the lead singer of The Remnants was my boyfriend in grade 6.&nbsp; Yup, no lie.&nbsp; I ran into Kenny at the merch tent early in the afternoon yesterday and we caught up for a bit.&nbsp; I remember he gave me a ring back in the day when we were 11.... ah, the memories.  I want to get over her.&nbsp; I want to get her out of my head so fucking badly.&nbsp; She's sucking the heart out of me and rendering me emotionally immobile.&nbsp; I should have seen this coming.... well, I did sort of see this coming, but I took my chances anyway.&nbsp; I kept my distance from her and didn't let myself get too involved, but I'm still having a hard time.&nbsp; Imagine what it would have been like if I had really let myself go?&nbsp; Damn.... I don't want to think about it.  I don't want to want her.&nbsp; I don't want to think about her anymore in that way.&nbsp; All I want is a friendship with her... but I have a feeling that's easier said than done with her.&nbsp; I'm the sort of person, if I feel a connection with someone, I'd rather have them in my life as a friend and get to know them on that level than not have them at all.&nbsp; I think that might be a tad bit more difficult for her.&nbsp; She feels as though she has to keep this emotional distance between her and anyone that she thinks she might have actual feelings for.&nbsp; It's retarded.&nbsp; Why she's choosing to miss out on getting to know someone that might actually be good for her is beyond me.&nbsp; I'll never understand it.  I just want to be her friend.&nbsp; I don't want her to shut me out of her life completely.&nbsp; I think she's an incredibly talented, intelligent, compassionate person and I feel lucky that she came into my life when she did.&nbsp; In the short time that we were together, she taught me a lot about myself... more specifically, what I can handle in a relationship.&nbsp; I discovered that I'm a lot more chill about open relationships and polyamoury than I thought I was.&nbsp; I'm not sure when or if I would have learned that about myself, if I hadn't started seeing her.  But now, here I am.... wondering why we can't continue what we had.&nbsp; I know she says that she can see herself getting attached to me and she needs to put a stop to this because she has feelings for me, but fuck.&nbsp; Why can't we just go with it?&nbsp; I'm not the type of person to put demands on her time... and I would never compromise her freedom, because I value mine so much.&nbsp; She has no idea how I feel about her and how strongly I feel that we might actually be good for each other.&nbsp;   So, we're "on pause"... whatever the hell that means.&nbsp; I should just drive to her house right now and tell her that I think we should "unpause" this thing.... that she should just give it a chance.&nbsp; If only I had the balls.... The one thing I know for sure is, she needs to know how I feel about her.&nbsp; She's been so open and honest with me about how she feels about me, it's only fair that I do the same for her.&nbsp; I don't feel like I owe it to her, but I feel like she deserves it.  Or maybe I'm doing exactly what she needs right now... maybe she needs to have feelings for someone that she thinks doesn't give a shit about her.&nbsp; I've done a very good job over the past several months, not letting on that I might actually give a damn about her.&nbsp; I've been very nonchalant and, as far as I know, she thinks I couldn't care less about her.&nbsp; Maybe she needs to know what it feels like to want someone that doesn't want her.&nbsp; Maybe that's why she "paused" it.&nbsp; Maybe she was afraid that her feelings weren't returned.&nbsp; Who the fuck knows?  I've always trusted my gut... my gut hardly ever fails me... and my gut is telling me that it's not the right time to tell her.&nbsp; I will tell.&nbsp; I just think maybe, just maybe... if I wait it out awhile, by the time I feel ready to tell her, she'll be in the position where she can actually accept it and appreciate it and process it.&nbsp; She's had so many people want her lately.... so many people confessing their love for her and whatnot.&nbsp; One more person isn't gonna make a mark.&nbsp; BUT... if I wait until she feels lonely.&nbsp; Until she feels like she might have actually missed out on something real.... I might get somewhere.  I feel strongly about certain people... I felt it with S. right away and I felt it with her right away.&nbsp; The morning after the first night we met and made out at the bar, I felt it.&nbsp; I knew I was in trouble with this one.&nbsp; I knew that she was the one that I was gonna pursue.&nbsp; I love a challenge.&nbsp; This girl has definitely been my biggest challenge to date.&nbsp; But I'll get her.... just give me time.

      Well, here's the blog.&nbsp; I'm not sure if anyone will even read this, seeing as how I don't plan on making it a well known fact that it exists.&nbsp; I need a place to rant and ramble semi-anonymously.&nbsp; The other online journal is read by too many people who know me in "real life."&nbsp; I find myself constantly backspacing and re-wording a lot of things that I write in it, knowing that everyone will read it.  I need to be free to let loose some verbal vomit (or something like that... err, yeah).&nbsp; Hopefully this thing will be a useful tool.
