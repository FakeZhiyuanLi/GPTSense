      Detours in life have always shaken me up, making me rethink my goals and what's important. The job I'd taken proved to be menial with very little pay. I did it well and was able to deposit $200 a week into my bank account. Not bad, considering that I had no income before.  Still, I was tired of living in motel rooms in and around L.A., dealing with people ten years my junior, and performing grueling work that kept me on my feet all day. I'd taken my home correspondence course on copywriting with me and managed to complete the first assignment. After that, exhaustion and defeat took over.  I found myself at one of the lower points in my life, feeling like a dismal failure. I'd told my husband as much when he called me. He knew.   The crew I worked with invited me out to dinner and barhopping. I jumped at the chance because I was beginning to climb the walls in my room. The L.A. danceclubs are wild places. Women fondling each other as they danced. One couple having sex with their clothes on up on the stage while raucous music assaulted the crowd.  The scene both revolted and exhilirated me. I found myself up on stage dancing by myself. I think I shocked my crew because they were still talking about it six weeks later.  But it was something that I needed, apparently, because I began to feel better. I was able to go home for Thanksgiving, but had to fly up to Washington state and then out to Phoenix. I decided to take my manuscript with me, which weighed a ton in my carry-on bag.  My novel is set in the boondocks, west of Phoenix, so I was excited about going on this trip. I handwrote a chapter and went sightseeing to Wickenburg, a small town 70 miles northwest of Phoenix. That trip was the highlight of my road job. Then it was back to L.A., where I received the news that we may be working up to Christmas Eve.  My husband told me to quit right then. He wanted me home. I wanted to go home. So I went.  Luckily, the manager needed a secretary. I would be working by myself for five hours a day while everyone was on the road. The office was so quiet it was almost spooky.  This was my chance to study my copywriting course. I not only studied copywriting, but returned to my study of Internet Marketing, where I studied the sales letters of the con artists versus the legitimate marketers. I had one question on my mind: Can I use their techniques to sell my book once it's finished and published?

      Hundreds of writers are using this service to find freelance work. A few have made quite a success at it. I thought I would give it a try, despite the exhorbitant registration fee. The first thing I did was check the profiles and portfolios of my competition.  Most of them had BS degrees in English and impressive portfolios. I have an AS in Computer Graphics, one published short story, my ebook that didn't get a great reception, and an unfinished novel. Thanks to my experience in HR, I managed to land a $50 resume assignment within a month and got a 5-star review to boot!   I posted more bids for projects that I felt I was qualified to do. A few buyers asked for samples (which I didn't have), but most ignored me for the more experienced providers. I felt like an 18 year-old kid again, fresh and penniless. But then, as things turned out, I landed a job that would take me away from my family and my writing for two and a half months.

      I left a very stressful job at the height of the recession, more concerned about the welfare of my family and my own mental health. My family was glad to have me back home, but the bills still needed to get paid. My local newspaper, once brimming with employment ads, had one scant page for jobs that I wasn't qualified for.  This led me onto the Internet, where I was introduced to the work-at-home scams. I fell for one and learned. Fortunately, I hadn't lost much money. But I started looking at all of the legitimate businesses online and wondered how they got started.  I found a copy of Robert G. Allen's  Multiple Streams of Internet Income  and snagged it. The book offered some good tips, but I had no idea where to start. Having enjoyed his book and being a bookaholic, I decided to look to see if he had any more books.   A brief search on the Internet turned up his site, which sold not only his books but ebooks and video courses on success. I wound up taking a success quiz, not realizing that I would find myself roped into his $5,000 mentor program for Infopreneuring.  The marketing company that represented the Robert G. Allen Success Course set me up with an Infopreneur mentor. My first assignment was to come up with an idea and an outline for my project. Again, I had no idea where to start.  Earlier that year, my son had to do a science project on solar energy. An exhaustive search on the Internet and the library produced very little that would help kids. What I did find, I had to translate into kid-friendly language.  Remembering that, I came up with my idea for an information-rich portal site that was focused on educational material. I drew up the outline and presented it to Mike at our next teleconference. He thought it was an awesome idea, but felt that it was too big of a project to tackle.  We started discussing ebooks. I was currently working on the sixth draft of my novel,  Prosperity  with a mentor from HWA (Horror Writer's Association). I didn't have any experience writing an ebook and said as much to Mike. He sent me some ebooks over the email and asked me to brainstorm.  I wrote an ebook, titled  Professional Self-Editing: How to Edit for Traditional, Print-on-Demand, & ePublishing . The idea came from the low quality books I had seen at Xlibris, iUniverse, and eBookNBytes. Mike loved what I had written. I didn't, so I bounced it off on my writing mentor and another writer. The polite, "That's good, Deb" warned me that the ebook wouldn't be received well by the writer community.  Eventually, I shelved the ebook and the Robert Allen Success Course. The portal site remained in the back of my mind for a long time.

      Not long after I found the e-publishing sites did I notice the mini-sites selling eBooks. My curiosity was piqued. 98% of them, I saw, were selling eBooks on how to market your products on the Internet. How interesting, I thought.  Others had to do with "turn-key systems" that will earn you $24 gazillion dollars in an hour. I'm exaggerating . . . almost. I started reading the sales letters on those sites. They pulled at me to buy, but the headlines were too gimmicky.   Then I started experimenting with key words to check out the rankings of these sites. I was impressed. Corey Rudl (one of the most successful Internet Marketers around) was ranked on Page One in the search engines.   Hmm, I thought. He wrote a book, titled Car Secrets and made it a huge success. How did he do that? I didn't buy his course right away, but I kept it in mind for a long time.  I found other courses by other big name marketers, along with affiliate program directories. I became familiar with ClickBank and other affiliate programs. Is there a way to take advantage of this for book marketing? I thought, "Yes . . . if you do it right."  The wheels inside my head began to turn faster.

      Have any of you read Stephen King's "The Plant"? If you haven't, it was the only ebook that King made himself. He never finished it. Why, I'm not sure. He told the press that it was an experiment.  I was disappointed that he didn't finish it because I was really starting to get into his story. But, I'm resilient and got over it. I didn't think anything of ebooks again until e-publishing websites started springing up all over the place. Wow, a new technology for me to explore!  The price was much more reasonable--a hundred bucks to upload your book and have them convert it into a .pdf. Not bad. Still, I wondered what the quality was going to be like.   I stumbled (as I always do) onto a site called  urlLink Ebooks n' Bytes  and decided that I wanted to become a reviewer of some of the books on the list. There were quite a few on the list. I picked some titles that interested me and shot off an email to the site's owner.   She sent me the first book, titled Purgatory something-or-other. My mind is so cluttered these days. :) But I do remember the story. It had an existentialist theme. Two women friends were on an airplane that crashed, killing everyone on board.   Both women women found themselves in Purgatory, which is the place between Heaven and Hell. The story had good potential but it dragged. More emotion should have gone into this story, and the characters should have been given tougher choices than what they were given. I said as much in my review, which I felt was constructive.  The site owner wrote me an email, thanking me for my review and gently pointing out that quality doesn't matter with e-publishing. My reaction was "What?!! Why not?" I didn't send a reply, and I decided not to review another book. What was the point if you can't give honest feedback?  e-publishing was the same as POD, but using a different format, as far as I was concerned. This indifference to quality spurned an idea inside my mind, although it hadn't quite taken hold yet.

      Although my writing teacher's words no longer stung, I had banished my dream of being on the New York Times Bestseller List. At least for now. But I still wanted to publish my novel once I finished it. The question was how?  Since 1996, I've browsed the major bookstores and writer's sites. Back then, I watched two writers earn their stripes--Tom Piccirilli and Douglas Clegg. Both started out publishing with small presses, and both have become best-selling horror writers. They each had their own niche (i.e., they didn't get sucked into writing for the market, which is vampires and serial killers). This encouraged me and still does today.  I looked into the small press industry, but found that they are just as selective as the traditional publishers. The ones who accepted my genre were looking for stories with a literary style and bent. Mine is contemporary. So, that option was out.  Sometime in late 1999, I started seeing ads for Xlibris, iUniverse, and Infinity Publishing. I checked out all three companies, surprised when I discovered their technology. Their price was prohibitive, so I sent away for their information. My email has been flooded with spam ever since.  I did buy a book from each of them. From Xlibris, I bought a book titled "A Certain Slant of Light", by Chandler McGrew. It was a horror novel, but the cover sported a white picket fence with pink flowers. If I hadn't read the synopsis, I would have mistaken it for a mainstream or romance novel.  The story was great. It was about the souls of two women that had crossed paths at their time of death. One was a teenaged girl, who had committed suicide. The other was a woman, who had died in an accident (if my memory is correct). The setting took place inside the woman's house, where she kept the girl in hiding from Hell, who hunted after her.  As for the quality of the writing, it should have been edited. There were a lot of redundancies and more than a few typos. I pointed this out in my review of A Certain Slant of Light on Amazon.com.  I was surprised to find an email from Mr. McGrew in my in-box 24 hours later. He said that I was right, that he should have had it edited before he published it.  I sent him an email, telling him that I was in the process of writing a novel and asking him questions about his publishing goals. He wrote back to me and told me that he had sent a copy of his POD book to a literary agent, along with his latest manuscript. Because he had published before, and because he proved that he was still writing had proved to the agent that his work was sellable. At that time, he had signed a 2-book contract with Bantam.  I've since lost contact with Mr. McGrew, but I did read his next novel, "Cold Heart." It was good, but I liked that first novel better. I love original stories.  Representatives from Xlibris and Infinity called me in order to make a sale. I told them no, that I couldn't afford the price right now. If I had had the balls, I would of told them that their products suck and how badly they are screwing new and impressionable writers over. But I was raised to be tactful and diplomatic.  I continued writing my novel, titled Prosperity. It's a ghost story set in the sticks of Arizona, involving a psychic woman who thinks she is an atheist until the dead start talking to her. I had my husband proofread the fourth draft because he started complaining about my time in the office.  I finished the story, but it had all kinds of plot holes and way too many characters. As with the prior drafts, I tore this one down. I tried to outline the plot, using the Dramatica Pro software, but my story kept taking unexpected turns. So, the outline was useless.   I did learn a great deal about literary theory by using this software and gave it a positive review on Amazon. Other writers weren't very happy with the program because they expected more help. This program isn't meant to write your book for you; it is meant to make you think. Since thinking and brainstorming are some of the things I love to do, the investment was worthwhile.  I bought two books called Character Traits and Dynamic Characters and read them cover to cover. Great books. I still have them on my shelf. This time, I decided to outline the characters themselves before I started on the next revision.   Another problem I was having was that too much of myself was playing into how my characters thought and how they reacted to certain situations. As I said above, I'm very diplomatic and rather quiet. The plot was beginning to stagnate. I found myself sitting in front of my computer for hours, doing nothing but spinning the ideas inside my head until something clicked. Sometimes it didn't and I had to walk away for a while.  I'd be doing something else when a new idea came. Then I'd go back into my office and write the scene down, feeling satisfied that I had done something productive. The next day, I would invariably tear it down if it didn't progress the plot or if it was weak in some way.   I joined a horror writer's forum, called the Parasitorium in 2000. The founder is published author and newspaper editor, Del Stone Jr. The forum has gone through its ups and downs, but it's still a great place to visit and learn from. I haven't checked lately but the last time I did, it was the most active and useful Yahoo Group forum on the subject of horror and sci-fi writing. Check it out, if you're interested.  In November of that same year, I joined the Horror Writer's Association. A year later, I signed up for a mentorship program because I was still having a hard time writing this novel. I was on the sixth draft and wondering if I should just shelve it and think about whether or not I should continue to write. Six months passed, and I heard nothing.  I continued to write because I'm addicted and stubborn as hell. My husband calls me Anvilhead when he's angry with me. Once I get an opinion or set my mind on something, nothing short of a very rude reality check can penetrate or stop me.   September of 2001, I get an email from HWA, who informs me that they have hooked me up with a mentor by the name of Dan Keohane. I spent the next two years working on this novel with him. I sent him the first five chapters and then sent him the rest as I finished them. He gave good critiques, pointing out where my flaws were in each scene. I appreciated that very much.  I asked him if he had published anything. He has published several short stories in various horror mags and was trying to get his novel-length manuscript published. Leisure Books had accepted it, but due to their two-year backlog, it wasn't going to get published any time soon. He wound up pulling it and submitting it elsewhere.  Since then, he's published a compilation of short stories, called  urlLink Christmas Trees & Monkeys , which he published through iUniverse. Dan is a perfectionist, so I didn't find any typos in his book. The cover also fits the theme.   I finished the sixth draft last fall. Dan told me that I had an extremely tight writing style for a first-time novelist. He encouraged me to send him the full manuscript when I have it edited.  Well, a third of the way through the editing process, I decided to tear the story down again. Surprised? I'm not anymore.   Maybe Revision 7 will be the place where everything finally clicks and comes together in a convincing and compelling way. I read recently that Ernest Hemmingway rewrote his novel, A Farewell to Arms 49 times before he felt it was right. That made me feel so much better!  I've decided not to pursue traditional publishing or POD once I finish Prosperity. There are many reasons for my decision. Traditional publishing, while offering the best exposure pays pittance in royalty fees for a first-time author.   POD is too expensive, and I've read too many horror stories about them. See  urlLink Books and Tales . This site will give you the best and the worst, where POD is concerned.  Self-publishing is looking like the way to go. I'll need to build up the capital and the contacts. I'm in the process of doing that right now, while I continue to write.

      I've always had stories running through my head ever since I can remember. But it wasn't until the spring after my 30th birthday that I decided to write them down. I'm an avid horror reader. So naturally, I wanted to write a horror novel.  My first novel-length story was about a serial killer who stalked a successful married woman. My idea was new back in 1997, but my characters were too flat and the plot way too predictable. I shelved it because I realized that there were too many novels about serial killers already. I'm not one to follow trends.  I wondered what I should write about next. Whatever it was, it had to be original and thought-provoking. An image came into my mind as I sat at my dining room table. I saw a woman standing on a large rock in a fiery lake in Hell, searching for the soul of her dead husband.   At the time, I wanted to write about Hell and black magic. I struggled with the story for several months, but nothing was coming together. I kept hitting brick walls (that dreaded writer's block).  While that was going on, I wrote a short story (Imaginary Friends), which got published in Welcome to Nod (now defunct) in 1999. Seeing my name published in a magazine sparked an obsession in me that hasn't died yet. I wrote five more short stories, all of which were rejected.   By this time, I had chucked the original idea for my novel, deciding it would be a ghost story. That felt right, and the ideas were beginning to form. I was beginning to get to know my characters, but I still had no idea where my story was going to go. I submitted the first 50 pages to an agent that I had set an appointment with at the 1999 Palm Springs Writer's Conference.  The conference was a blast. My appointment was on the first day of the three-day conference. His name was Ken, and his agency was somewhere in L.A. He gave me a professional smile as I sat across from him. The first thing out of his mouth was, "You're a good writer, but your story and your characters lack grit."  Basically what he said was that my story bored the hell out of him. But I focused on "You're a good writer" and walked out of the room with a smile on my face. That was all I wanted to hear.  I listened to Harlan Ellison, Tami Hoag, and Ray Bradbury give their presentations about how they wrote their books. I had Ray Bradbury sign a copy of his book, Fahrenheit 451, and gulped down my nerves long enough to say hello and thanks. I'll never forget the standing ovation he received after he finished his speech. It was so inspirational and inspiring.  I took my unfinished manuscript back home and tore it down, rewriting the first chapter ten more times until it had "grit" that I felt I could be proud of. My shelves filled with every "how-to" book on writing that I could find. They helped me overcame the brick wall that hit me midway through my first through third revisions. Although I hadn't finished the story yet, I had an ending in mind and the aim to seek publication.  Just to make sure everything was okay, I decided to use my manuscript when I enrolled in the Writer's Digest School course. My teacher was an established author, who had a heavy background in television production. He enjoyed my plot summary and the first ten pages of the first chapter. My work was original, and my writing style was unique.  His praise made my ego soar. This book that I've been struggling to write was going to be a hit, I thought. His words evoked images of my book sitting on the bookshelves of my local Barnes&Noble. I envisioned nothing less than stardom.  Then it came time to write the query letter and the outline. Boy, was that hard! I did it, although I wasn't happy with the result. I submitted this with the first 50 pages of my manuscript. His comments came almost a month later.  They crushed me. My plot was incohesive. My story would either be a hit or a flop. "Getting your novel published is akin to winning the Lotto," he said.  I gave up on my writing career that night and treated myself to a big pity party. My dreams of becoming an overnight bestseller were gone. The disappointment felt like a natural disaster in my heart.  The next morning I woke up and walked down the hall as I always do. My computer beckoned to me as I walked by the office. I wanted to ignore it, but my feet carried me into the room. My hand pressed the ON switch out of habit.  Writing had become a part of me, I realized. I couldn't walk away from it any more than I could stop breathing. Another realization hit me--the reality check I had received the day before hadn't killed me. At this point in time, I was a "good writer." I still am, although I am improving.  Becoming a publishable writer is going to take some time, just as becoming a doctor or a lawyer takes time. I had been unrealistic with my expectations and childish with my reaction. A month or two passed before I picked up my teacher's letter and read it word for word.  The words on that page no longer hurt. I conceded that he was right, and then I continued writing my story. But I wanted to know what it takes to become that top 2% we call bestsellers. What do we have to do to break through the steel doors of the traditional publishing industry?  This question put me on a three-year journey to find the answer.
