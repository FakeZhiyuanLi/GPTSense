       Last night, there was a major scare directed towards me. My mom changed her password so I couldn't get around the parent controls, meening no blogs. Now, she doesn't know I have a blog, so I am always being sneeky bout it. And it also would meen no google, yahoo, or any other search engines. Yet, somehow this morning I was able to access my blog. Very strange, but good. Now I can do blogs again! Yay!

       To enlighten those who read my dreary posts earlier, here are some funny things.  I swear you haven't lived until you've seen a horse with blue lips and tonge. Now, the horse wasn't sick, it was eating a blue Lick-It treat. It had the same effect of a human eating a green lollypop. I thought that was something good. And I saw a stand selling fireworks next to a gas station. All it would take was one match and BOOM! Gosh, it's something I can see someone I know doing. Haha! Just to make you (and me) laugh.

       My life is improving. I'm feeling better. I went to the barn for 4 hours and had a lovely time. Stuff is still wrong, but it seems a bit lighter now.

       I hate summer break. Too much time to think about things. Too few things to do. I get sorta depressed over summer when something heavy hits me. Right now, my mind is a whirl of confusion that I can't sort out. So many emotions and I don't know what to do with them. I do have a real problem, but... I dunno. If you care anything about my well-being (which I doubt you do) talk to me or something. Maybe someone will help.

       Not good, not good at all. My friend got yelled at by her dad who told her to get out of his house. So, she did. And she started to bike to mine. She called me and asked me if I could pick her up. I told her she needed to go home, but she insisted. So I told my mom who talked to her (she had a cell). My mom then called her mom who wanted her to come home. She didn't even ask if we could pick her up. We called her back and told her, but I don't think she'll go. I'm gonna call her again in 10 min, but I don't know. She may just run away. The thing is, she didn't even annoy her dad. She made him hashbrowns this morning and gave him a card. Her mom's pissed at her too. We were talking bout it and we have no idea why. I hope she goes home. She may just bike to my house or another friend's house or something. She's gonna run away by the time she's 15, I know it. Bad things happen to young run aways. I'm worried bout her. Any advice, please comment. I'm gonna eat lunch now to calm down, then I'll call her.

       Today was a horse show. I rode my horse Simon (obviously). We placed 3rd in the first walk/trot class, then we didn't place in the walk/trot/canter. Next class was jumping, in which I fell off (for those who care, no I was not hurt, I just have a scratch on my hip), so we schooled him (rode him between classes doing hack work and jumping). He was great for that, except he kicked out and ran into another horse. I felt   really   bad. Anyway, then we didn't place the rest of the day. And Simon kicked out while cantering otherwise I swear we would've placed. Other than that, he was amazing. I forgive and forget with my horse very quickly.  Sorry if you're not a horse person and read this and was bored stiff. It's just the only big thing that's happened to me.

       One of the more important thing) Horse show today! Yay! Too bad not many people care. But I'll talk bout it anyway. I didn't have to wake up at 5:30 this morning to get to the barn by 6:00. My horse (Simon is his name for those who care) isn't getting trailered over until 10:00. In other words "yipee for me!" So what am I doing with a chance to sleep in til around 8:30 or so? I'm online, blogging. Of course  Complete waste of time) At the moment, I'm trying to beat the expert level of Minesweeper. If I do, it proves I have much more free time than my sister (Bruce Almighty is a good movie, and don't try to tell me otherwise). I was down to 5 mines yesterday. 5! Okay, that was a complete waste of time (just like this post). I'm done now.  zzzzzzz) Dumb computor gave me trouble when I was trying to sign in. I really love Macs (I'm on my mom's IBM ThinkPad right now) except the Mac we have is almost as old as me. Therefore, I only have AOL 5.0. Grrr! It drives me mad.  Sorry, the last two sections of my post were a   complete   waste of time. For you see, my life is online, at home, and at barn. Occasionally at friends' houses.   P.S. Isn't "yes" really awkward to use in a sentence? And isn't "awkward" so awkward to spell (see, see what I did there)?  Okay, I'm done.

       Some people who read this may know Lewis Carroll as the author who wrote Through the Looking Glass and many other books with Alice (don't know/can't think of any right now). In Through the Looking Glass are two wonderful poems were written called  The Walrus and the Carpenter  and  The Jabberwocky . I LOVE both of these poems and thought it'd be nice to share them with anyone with enough time to read this and that cares. So, go to http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/walrus.html if you want the Walrus and the Carpenter, and then there's an link to get to The Jabberwocky. If you don't know them by heart (I know the Jabberwocky by heart) then read them. Just felt like sharing that cause I'm in a random/slightly hyper mood.

       This is not completely random. There is actually a real reason behind this.  I ate fish tonight. Now, to some, this seems normal, but not to me. I DON'T eat fish. Sorta like a vegetarian, only with fish, not all animals (I still like chicken and turkey and stuff). Reason: When I discovered about the bycatch and stuff that comes as a result as fishing, I swore never to eat fish/seafood. I had to tonight. I felt terrible. Now, if I am forced to eat shark meat, I will seriously yell my head off and lock myself in my room without contact to anyone on the "outside" world (not even through internet (MESA WANT A LAPTOP!) Worst thing is, the fish tasted good, I liked it. I swore I was gonna hurl when I thought of what the fish looked like before it was killed...  Happy note that makes me laugh! I have a friend/long lost brother (Name's Mike (he's been my friend since the diaper days!)) who my sister and I once convinced him that he was born with a tail (he's older than me!). So, he was about 10 years old or so and we told him he was born with a monkey tail and the doctors had to cut it off. We said we had pictures. He believed us for the longest time. I'm sure to blog more about the funny tricks we've played on him. Makes me laugh.

       My sister came home from boarding school today (George School for anyone who reads this and cares), so she obviously had a lot of boxes (mostly milk crates). So, the family was lugging the boxes in and my sis handed me a milk crate with shoes and food inside it (bout 3 pairs of shoes). I stared at it and said "why do you have shoes with your food" and she just said "hey, they both fit fine." Later, I took in another box with food and her meds, food and hydrocortizone, and one with just food. Later on she pulled a box out of the car marked "fragile" so of course she throws it to me, I mean, literally throws it! Agian, a strange look at her and she said "well, it's so tightly packed with paper, plus, it's just a few mugs" The whole thing was very strange and funny.

       First off: This blog will be changing a little bit now and then, until I get it just how I like. Sorry if it annoys you, but is annoys me more.  Second thing: My name, Skittlish It is not a random name, believe it or not, for I am a fairly random person. It started when one of my friends called me Caittles. I hated this and if they called me that I would ignore them (I'd do the same thing when called Katie). Then, another of my friends thought is sounded like Skittles. I was going to make this my blog name (hence the title, Taste the Rainbow if the whole thing worked...) but the blog people wouldn't let me (probably because it is product placement), so I became Skittlish instead. There's some useless knowledge for anyone who is bored enough to find and read this blog.

       Hmm, wow, first blog. Very cool. Now, what to say? I guess I'm wasting my first blog typing aimlessly. Quite boring, I know, but I think people will survive (if people read this at all!). But, that's okay! Now I'm hyper, which is not good. Hehe, mwahahaha! Well, I may talk about deeper stuff later on, just not now. Oh, my sis is coming home tomorrow. What fun (said very dryly (I don't spell well)). Anyway... Mine as well not read this cause I just wasted your time! Haha! Now to take over the world! ::smacks self on face:: Had to get that out of my system. All better.

       I've returned from the beach. It was fun. Then I just never got online for a while. Didn't think many people would care if I didn't post for a while so I didn't. Other than me getting fryed like an oyster, going tubing and stuff, and seeing the Assateuge (however it's spelt) ponies really  really  close to me, not much happened. Then I went to the Kimberton Fair (lots of fun) and Hershey Park (still fun). And I still need to write this dumb letter to Mr. G. for high school stuff due Aug. 1st. Booooo!!!! Hmm, gonna say somein... uh... oh well. I like traffic lights. Blah.

       Well, I was spending my time packing tonight cause I'm going to the beach/shore/thingy with sand and salty water tomorrow for a week. Chances are I won't be online or posting for a week. Make sense? It should. Anyway, messages to people: Alaina, if you break up with Carson, call me on Sunday (as in next week) or comment on the blog. Christy, cell in locker, hope you got it, if not check my locker and comment on blog. Will, back in a week. Dougie, blah. Anyone else who reads this, so long, fare well, avidisay (or whatever it is) adure...

          I gotta wait for breakfast (bannana chocolate chip muffins, mmmm, so good) cause they're baking, so I mine as well blog.     For the past week I've been helping at a camp at the barn I ride at. Let's put it this way, 10 kids no older than 5th grade, 10 horses, and 10 sets of tack (saddles, bridles, ect, you get the picture). Over half of them had no idea what to do, hence they were at the camp to learn. It was from 9-3 (for me it was more 8:45- 3:30, one day I stayed til 7:30, that's almost 11 hours at the barn!), so I was pretty wiped (haven to tack, un-tack, hose down, and go on trails with the many kids). That was from Mon. til Fri. Last day was a horse show (very funny!). Then Sat was my barn day anyway when I stay all day and help with lessons.    Oh, muffins are done, but they hafta cool. Anyway, I had a horse show on the 4th and placed in five classes. I got a 3rd, 2 4ths, and 2 5ths. It was my best horse show ever. I was very happy. Too bad today's horse show is rated so I can't go.    Oh, and before the horse show I went to CCW (Camp Conrad Weiser). Left one Sat. and returned the next (the day before the show). I went to the camp dance in half chaps and boots. Made some friends. Got some nicknames. I was Weasle. Alaina was Twiggy. Molly was Twitch and Melanie was Reggie (new friends). It was a lot of fun. Very tiring to hafta ride 2 times a day, but I enjoyed it. Got to go hand-galloping on Cruz and jump Ebony (only kid in camp to do that!) and everything else on Skip (more jumping and some dressage. Anyway, I jumped a big black horse named Ebony, and as we were rounding the corner for the first jump, the conseler Tiger said "oh, just so you know, Ebony jumps big" By big, I thought she men half a foot over to a foot over. Boy was I wrong. He reused the first jump, but I finally got him over it. He jumped about 2 feet bigger than the jump.Wow. That was a feeling. Then I jumped him over the 2ft vertical and he jumped it 4ft. We did it a few times again, but I got over the Oh my God, I'm jumping 2ft bigger the original Jump feeling, and enjoyed my ride.    Yay! Muffin's are done! I'll blog more later.

       Now, I have returned from Oldfields (an AWSOME school (sorry Gabo, don't hurt me)). Anyway, I am debating on getting a chatterbox. Please comment and tell me what you think. If I get enough support, I'll get one. If not, oh well. That is all. See y'all (hmm, I sound like my cousins in Alabama, cool).

       Haven't been posting for a while, I know. Oh well. Went to the Rick's Tent Sale! Wha hoo!!!! Everything in it up to 80% off! So happy! Got two (count um, 2!) Navahoe pads for 10 dollars each!!! So happy!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm gonna go back to the raffle drawing, I could win $1,000 shopping spree there! I probably won't win but hey! a girl can dream. Anyway, I'm also reading The Shining by Stephen King right now. I'm not far into it but it seems good. Oh, if you want to laugh go  urlLink here  to see various movies re-inacted in thirty seconds by bunnies (cooler than it sounds). Definatly watch the Titanic. And the Exorsist. And the Shining. Alien is a little weird, but if you've seen the movie you'll understand it I guess. Anyway I switched riding trainers at my barn from Denise to Leigh (all cheer) so now I'm doing more (example, my second lesson with Leigh I had never done a roll back or a broken line on my horse (I'd done brokens on others) and I did a course full of them. It was surprisingly fun. Fun fun fun. bye bye
