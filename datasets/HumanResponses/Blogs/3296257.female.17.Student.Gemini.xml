      why are u reading this? i told u not too. Well life offically sucks, i hate most ppl and things and everything..i'd say more but i really don't want randoms to know all about my life..but i guess i reallly have nothing to hide, rite? not that it matters because i'm too selfcontious, so u can all wonder about how truly depressed i am. or am i just full of shit?..u'll never know. No one will ever know, because like i said b4, i'm just too self contious. if your confused..u shold be. i told u not to read this, u just can handel temptation can u? is ur life that boring that u have to read about mine on a on-line journal?..it seems as thought the latter of the two is more correct..am i not rite? so are u comparing ur self to me? have u decided that you are better yet?..or am i the better one, or have i confused u so much that u won't continue reading this. nope, u've decided to keeping reading my bull shit. or am i just speaking the truth?...of course i'm not, because ur rite and if u are always right then i must be wrong..am i correct?..well saying yes would be a contridiction to urself rite, so to make urself fee; better you will say no..but wait if i could predict that. then that can't be true either..because that would make me rite, rite?..wrong. ur worst nightmare, or ur ecstasy? ur annoyance or entertainment?..what am i to u?.. i'm nothing. what do u see when u stare into my eyes? can u see the sadness, can u feel the coldness coming from my heart?..am i dead inside?.. would u ever be able to feel my pain? am i saying this for kicks?...do i think that i'm trying to be "deep"?..do i give a fuck what u think? I told u not to read this

      So, if everybody didn't know that i'm not all there mentally u do now. It is offically genetics..and me being the expert i should know. i also believe that my unstable mental ways rub off on other people. U are being affected if you feel any of these symptoms: uncontrolable giggling, lashing out at random people, Screaming or loud outbursts for no reason at all, swating at people for no reason at all, making VERY bad impressions of famous people and feeling minor urges to injur someone. 1.My advice for myself: don't have children. 2.My advice for everybody else: step away.

      Monday June 28, 2004 Hello hello it is me again…surprise surprise..and im playing solitaire, very exciting..the weather still sucks ass…and about my plan to only eat fruit and yogurt, umm yah…well u see we don't have any yogurt here…and there are slim pickin's when it comes to fruit. We have to EXTREAMLY tiny apples and they're kinda mushy…yuck…and there is an orange…but u see when I eat any thing juicy it gets all over me…(lets all refer back to the strawberry) so I looked in the fridge and I found sum jello, that is fruity isn't it? but then came my dilemma what do u eat jello with so I stood there with the utensil drawer open staring blankly, shifting my eyes back and forth from the forks to the spoons. Now maybe it has been the lack of sleep or sumthing, but, I was stumped…and I couldn't decide, so I grabbed the spoon. Seeing as it would be the most helpful when trying to get eh jello out of the container. That was pretty much my exciting morning, and now im listening to cold hard bitch by jet…woo hoo..ok, I gotta get back to my game of solitaire alright, later losers
