      June 15 is a day that holds a lot of meaning to me and a very special person about 4,000 miles away. I met him 6 years ago on June 15. I would say he was my first love. I thought I was going to marry him. He still thinks I might! He's wrong. And he knows it. hehe. He called me this morning to wish me a 'Happy Aniversary'. I think he's still cute though.   On a less sappy note. I have three full days left here in Maine. I left the Island this morning watching my sister and nieces wave goodbye. It was so hard. I cried the entire boat ride back to the mainland. Thats all for now I don't want to stay in this mood.   Have a great day to all!

      What a wonderful conversation I had with a new dear friend tonight. People come in and out of our lives for reasons sometimes we don't know. Sometimes they stay for awhile and sometimes it's forever. I am so lucky and blessed to be soon surrounded by these wonderful people.   My cat and I were sitting here watching the Farewell To Ronald Reagan. Amazing man, he was. I can remember when the Berlin Wall came down. I can remember when we studied his speaches in Social Studies. There should be more men like Ronald Reagan. My cat wasn't around during his presidency. But I remember it well. Have a good day all. See you in Pennsylvania soon.

      'Peanuts I always thought Peanuts spoke more wisely than his years...now I know why after reading Charles Schultz Philosophy. The following is the philosophy of Charles Schultz, the creator of the "Peanuts" comic strip. You don't have to actually answer the questions. Just read through and you’ll get the point. 1. Name the five wealthiest people in the world. 2. Name the last five Heisman trophy winners. 3. Name the last five winners of the Miss America contest. 4. Name ten people who have won the Nobel or Pulitzer Prize. 5. Name the last half dozen Academy Award Winners for best actor and actress. 6. Name the last decade's worth of World Series winners. How did you do? The point is, none of us remember the headliners of yesterday. These are no second-rate achievers. They are the best in their fields. But the applause dies. Awards tarnish. Achievements are forgotten. Accolades and certificates are buried with their owners. Here's another quiz. See how you do on this one: 1. List a few teachers who aided your journey through school. 2. Name three friends who have helped you through a difficult time. 3. Name five people who have taught you something worthwhile. 4. Think of a few people who have made you feel appreciated and special. 5. Think of five people you enjoy spending time with. 6. Name half a dozen heroes whose stories have inspired you. Easier? The lesson: The people who make a difference in your life are not the ones with the most credentials, the most money, or the most awards. They are the ones that care. Pass this on to those people who have made a difference in your life. "Don't worry about the world coming to an end today. It's already tomorrow in Australia."

      A New Day So today is memorial day. I always think of this day as the beginning of summer festivities. Cookouts are one of my favorite things to do in the summer time. And as most know cookouts go hand-in-hand with memorial day. Not having much family or friends up here in Maine, I knew chances of having a cookout were slim. Actually the weather was the determining factor. It was such a beautiful day. I haven't seen one this good since about a year ago. I took my nieces for a nice long walk to a pond on the island(go figure). We played with turtles and frogs which is another one of my favorite things. hehe. The best thing about my nieces is that they are opposites. Nellie, the oldest, who is three now, is very timid and shy when it comes to new things and people. MaryBridget, whom I call MaryB, is almost two and NOT shy. She practically dove in the pond after the frog. Quite the experience for me today when all I wanted was a cookout! I swear I am not bitter. P.S. I didn't get my cookout!

      So here I am back where I started. I wish I knew what I was thinking. But sometimes I can’t even figure that out. Lately, though, writing in here has let me release a lot of emotions, feelings, and any other pent up frustrations I have been having. It’s funny, about a year ago; my entire journal entry would have been about a boy. And now, it’s about life, my life. No ones else’s life, just my own. I am back to the place that I still refer to as home. My sister and I ventured here with her two children. While we are on the subject of sister here are my thoughts. A sister is one whom waits just a little bit for you to catch up and join her in a few adventures in life before she starts her own life. A sister is someone you share things with and you aren’t afraid she is going to run back and tell you mother. I am drained today after a 6 hour conversation with my sister about well, something I don’t believe in. I listened to her. I heard her. But I can’t imagine leaving my life and my decisions up to someone who has met me 6 times in my life. So there I said it. We don’t believe the same thing, that’s ok. If I can keep an open mind for her shouldn’t she do the same in return. Lord, I am trying. I don’t believe in reincarnation. I don’t believe in psychics. I don’t believe someone can tell you that you are making the right decision because ultimately you are the only one who knows whether or not you are making the right decision.

      For the past week I have ben in Maine. I can't describe it. It was good and bad all wrapped into one.&nbsp; Good to see people bad to know that its not my home anymore. I guess maybe it never was. Maybe just a pit stop on my lifes journey. Either way it has left an impression on me. One i will never forget. Some people surprised me with their kindness, others didn't surprise me at all. Things left undone and unsaid before have now been said and done. I let go of the insucurities I had and just let life happen for a couple of days. It relieved A LOT of stress.   Upon returning home this afternoon, it was raining. I love the rain. It feels wonderful on your skin. My brother has just bought a house and moved into it and my parents are still in Maine, so I came home to an emty house. A nice feeling after being with so many people over the last month. There are no sounds in the house and if I listen closely I can hear the rain. Its good to be back. Back to reality, where I know things work out.&nbsp; I am gonna miss the 'drinking games'&nbsp; and the 'late-night talks' or me and my bottle of pucker and you with your coke and rum. (if you are reading this...it's been fun.)   yuk....I hate feeling this way. hehe

      For the first time, I felt the panic attack coming on. I refuse to let something like a panic attack stop me. So thats what I did, I let it happen and I went on about my business. My doctor says i am stressed beyond what I shoudl ever be. I told her to graduate from college, move 12 hours away, see you ex with his "new" grilfriend, and start taking meds again and see if she is not a 'little' stressed. hehe. Oh and not find&nbsp; a single job! Beyond that I feel like My life is pretty dam good. I am eating lunch with a friend today. She is one of those friends who you know you'll be 90 with and have no teeth still laughing our butts off at the random things in life. I am also leaving for Maine on Wednesday. Just for a week or two...haha. just for a week. But I do miss it. I miss my girls...and my&nbsp; sister. of course my brother-in-law. And Cathy!!!!!!! and the ocean... &nbsp; so long fare well!  &nbsp; Brownwyn

      I have a bad habit.  Bitting my nails . It's nasty when you realy think about it. But nevermind that. Again, I am not sure why I am even writing in here. But I am. My job search is becoming almost unbearable. I didn't really expect it to be this hard. I have applied to a zillion jobs through Guthrie. But nothing yet. Jared told me about a job opening in Wellsboro. And I am greatful. I applied and took them my resume. I am just not sure what I want to do yet.  I am still contemplating going back to school for radiology or teaching at Mansfield. But I am not sure. I really wish someone would tell me what to do. Haha. oh well. Tomorrow night we are all going to the BearAss(sp) for wings.  And then there is a wonderful metor Shower. The August ones are always awesome.  anyways...I am being patient.

      So tomorrow is my dad's  54th  birthday! I know I can hardly believe it myself. My mom is away at  old ladies camp . Something she has done since I was 2. So a good 20 years she has been going and she is always away for my dads BD. Usually my brothers and I got him balloons and a cake and took it to his office. But I don't know what i am gonna do this year. I know one thing I am gonna make it special. He is an awesome guy. This year since my mom is away at camp and my older brother just moved out, its just me and my dad in the evening. We actually watched TV tonight...together.  It was fun.  Wednesday is Joy's Birthday. She will be  24.   Amazing how time flies. we have known each other for 9 years.  Another dear friend of mine Jamie killgore has a birthday on the 8th and she will be 23. I haven't seen her in 4 years. we met In   Colorado   at a Ranch that I worked on.  Thats all for today.....weird entry!!!!
