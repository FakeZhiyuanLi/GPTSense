      Sheila and I need 50 different illustrations for graduation.  We have about a dozen done and ready to be scanned (with minor touch-ups after the scanning since I'm practicing inking on them.).  We've got about another 20 or so ready to go with ideas, if not more than that.  We're stumped on a few, though.    The biggest stumpers are the english classes.  We just can't think of ANYTHING to put on them...any ideas?  Email me or comment or something....show me that Sheila and I aren't the only people popping on here!!! :)  Sheila, if you see this, put the titles of the english cards in the comments.

      Ok, I've got the shell of the website pretty much laid out.  But, now I need content.  Please e-mail me a short bio about yourselves (50 words or less) or I'll be forced to write one for you, and I don't really know anything about everyone's contributations to the company.  For example:  Adam Roche (Story Developer) – Adam is known to everyone as “Roche” (pronounced just like the ubiquitous insect, reputed to have great taste in restaurants and the ability to outlive all of mankind should a nuclear Holocaust consume the earth), which is actually the correct way to say his surname.  Roche is a compendium of comics, graphic novels and roleplaying game information, an essential team player to generate new ideas and make sure that we don’t accidentally commit plagiarism.  Roche recently went back to Edinboro University to complete his studies in psychology.     Becky Lemmon (Support) - Becky is Spencer’s wife, muse and love.  Although Becky is not a direct contributor to the company per se, she fulfills the very necessary role of Rational Second Opinion and Objective Critic.  When you see a comic or game produced by Immature Graphics, usually Becky’s levelheaded and honest input has gone into polishing the finished product.  ....and it just kind of peters out from there.    Also, I was thinking for the website of making up some Flash animation demos for the board and card games.  I'll start looking around on the web to see if there are some free resources.    If Blake and Spencer could put together a few strips of Squid Row, that could go on there too as an online comic (much like PvP).  There's a lot of things we could do with the website to promote ourselves, so let's get crackin'!

      Oh yeah, as you guys join up, I'm giving you administrative access.  That means you'll get more pretty buttons on your posting page for the blog.   It probably goes without saying, but if you don't understand it, don't fuck with it.  And if you look at the invite members section, for the love of god, don't take anyone else's admin access away.    Cool?

      Hi All,   After about 50 tries, I made it into the IG Group Blog.  I'm very happy to be here! :-)  I was getting a little worried when Tracy said I'd been talking to some people at the 'con, but I didn't remember anything about "dimestore."  Then, I went to the site and discovered, YES! I did talk to the girl who writes rumble strips (and has very cool t-shirts) about the SPA (Small Press Association). I purchased a copy of a compilation of several small press folks.  They had an awesome cover (which is why I bought it), but I haven't read the inside yet.  Kerrie

      They had a booth at the con, and I know Kerrie was talking to them.  Folks, this is the way to go, I think, atleast for regular sized stapled comics, adn depending the size, might just be what we want for everything printing wise.  Dreamweaver is a little cheaper for smaller runs of stuff, but they are comparable in larger quantities.  Plus they are part of a distribution system.  http://www.dimestoreproductions.com/index.asp?http://www.dimestoreproductions.com/Forum/Printing.asp  Go check them out.  Join up, read the forums if you haven't already.  It's very informative.

      I'm definately in (mostly because Tracy would destroy me if I didn't).  :)  So how fired up is everyone still?  I can't wait to get to work on the comic; I've got some character sketches done and they've been approved by my writer.  ;)    I'll probably do some more sketches today, but I'd rather not start drawing until Tracy's done writing.    Does anyone else have an idea of what they'd like to bring to the table next year?  Sheila.

      Alright, here we go with a guilt trip!  What have YOU done lately?  Creatively, that is?  I'll kick it off.  Ya'll, if you bother to check this who idea of a group blog out, want to respond, use the comment section.  I've inked up some pics for Graduation.  Sheila's drawn some pics for Graduation.  That's about it.  Oh, and Roche, if you read this, I've got some ideas for game mechanics if you're serious about doing that talkshow host game.  If you need the help or want to brainstorm.  If not, feel free to tell me to fuck off to my own projects. :)  NEXT!

      Been meaning to pass this on for ages:  http://www.egoworks.com/dreamweaverpress/printing.html  Of all the googling I've done at work, they seem to have the best prices for printing.  It would be good for graphic novels.  Still haven't found one I'm happy with for regular size (24 pages) comics.

      Spencer, &nbsp; If you want to do a new post, you do it from your admin-like page (the one you see when you go to  urlLink www.blogger.com  and log in).&nbsp; If you want to comment, you only have to be reading the blog page itself, and I think you can comment from it by reading the comments section. &nbsp; You can start a new topic whenever it's something new, you want to make sure everyone sees it, etc.&nbsp; I have my preferrence set that I get an email whenever someone posts a comment, so I'll see everything whether it be comments or new posts. &nbsp; I'd say if you're going to well, comment, on someone's post, it's best to do it in the comment section to keep it all together.&nbsp;  &nbsp; A little less navigable than a message board, but I think it'll be easier for us since there are only a few people to use it.&nbsp;

      Hey all: &nbsp; Howdy to all!&nbsp; This is my first blogging, so bear with me! &nbsp; So here's what I'm definitely going to be working on for the next con. First: Squid Row.&nbsp; Spencer and I are on the job.&nbsp; The book will be along the lines of Dork Tower in structure.&nbsp; We're starting the whole shebang (darn you Hung)&nbsp;with Rush week at the college and going from there.&nbsp; If you have any funny stories or ideas from college or that would make good strips, let us know.&nbsp; I'd like to make a full-length issue, perhaps even a small graphic novel.&nbsp; Also, does anyone know how Flash animation works?&nbsp; The idea to do some flash of Squid Row was tossed around and I like it.&nbsp; Let me know if you know or know where I can find out.&nbsp; This could be something that could really promote the website! &nbsp; By the way, what's the status of the website currently?&nbsp; How can we resurrect it if it's dead?&nbsp; What can we do with it once it's up?&nbsp; I know we've talked about all this before, but let's start tacking ideas up and kickin' em around, as Tracy says. &nbsp; The other thing I'll for sure be working on for the con is "Story of Winter".&nbsp; That's right, it's coming out of mothballs.&nbsp; I'm pretty much scrapping the old idea and streamlining the story.&nbsp; I'll post some of it as I go for critique and suggestions.&nbsp; Right now, I'm going with a journal idea, with sketches and random paintings to accompany, with a traditional comic style to wrap it up.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Beyong these, we have a bunch of ideas up here.&nbsp; I just want to focus on these and planning for now.&nbsp; Speaking of, are we going with a half booth?&nbsp; How do we want it set up?&nbsp; Any banner ideas?&nbsp; How's about "merchandise", such as t-shirts, stickers, posters, etc?&nbsp; Throw em up here! &nbsp; I'll stop now.&nbsp; Have a good one!

It's so thin and small, it can't hurt anyone right?  Wait...don't they say the same things about habanero peppers?  This is a big cigar in a little body and it socks a punch!  Then, curiously, as you're enjoying the pungent strength of this stick and waiting for you to be knocked on your butt by the end, around half way through, it starts to mellow and become creamy as the flavour develops.  This is completely the opposite of what I was expecting, and a great surprise at that.

This is like smoking a pint of premium espresso; the taste is very full bodied and the wrapper is dark and oily.  Such a great combination!  Not for the faint of heart, romantic and fantastic connotations aside.  A great cigar to have as dessert, with a creamy, sweet root beer or sweet wine.  Skip the cheesecake, and pick up this cigar!  You definitely won't be sorry.  Then eat the cheesecake.  :)

I never really tried one until a few months ago when we got on as part of a sampler... after a few puffs I was blown away by the flavour which I described to Tracy as "outside."   "What do you mean it tastes like 'outside'?" she asked, more out of curiosity then patronism. "It tastes like scent of a forest in autumn, with notes of the orange leaves, fresh air, live wood, and a cleanness that is natural and untouched.  I can't describe it any other way.  It tastes like outside."   I know that I probably just described a lame commercial for some rugged chewing tobacco, but when I smoke 5 Vegas, I get that taste and that feeling.  The flavour develops nicely, the construction is great, and I can see myself smoking this cigar in the very place that I picture: fishing, camping, golfing or just enjoying the outdoors.  5 Vegas tastes fresh, natural, and a little sweet with a very full bodied and creamy woodiness.

Strength: Medium Rating: 7 1/2 out of 10 Comments: Perfectly constructed with a wonderful burn, this cigar was a pleaser from the start.  Great flavour develpment with some notes of wood and leather with a very, very subtle spice.  The pepperiness is definately a background touch, but unmistakably there, never overpowering or taking centre stage.  Rick flavour, and a rich price tag, but never the less, a rich treat!

Smooth flavour with a hint of spice, awesome flavour!  A surprisingly nice compliment to my homebrewed red ale.  We can definitely see this as a staple in our humidor.  Great construction, easy draw... all around a damn good cigar!

      Maker: Drew Estate Size: 3" x 33 Strength: Powerful! Rating: 9 out of 10 Comments: We accidentally ended up with these by mistake... I bid on them thinking that these were a bundle of regular sized IPs.  What should have tipped me off was 40 sticks for $25 bucks.  I just didn't pay attention to the size of them, and when I e-mailed Tracy at work, she was pretty miffed.  I think that she wrote back: "33 gauge??  That's as small as a Tatiana almost!!  Didn't you look at the size?!"  After she calmed down, Tracy did have to admit it was still a steal.     We tried them this afternoon sitting outside, and man, these are NOT even close to Tatianas!  I really like them, and they were not what I was expecting.  Smoking the 3 Kings size of Industrial Press is like smoking one of those lady finger fire crackers.  Very, very peppery and pungent.  A great change from the usual routine of cigarillos.  The dark oily wrapper is box pressed, and the cigar itself is conical, like a mini Belicoso.  This small cigar begs to be smoked at the pub or bar... portable and enjoyable.  I'd never smoke one on an empty stomach though, I think I'd feel sick.  I'm thinking of putting a dozen down for a bit to see if they mellow as an experiment.  What a great mistake!

Comments: Another of our household unquestionable faves, Nat Sherman never lets us down for consistent quality and taste.  A little bit sweet, very creamy and indulgent, I swear I'll get gout from smoking these.  Excellent when paired with coffee or root beer, and always a treat.  Nats develop about half way down and become silkily medium in flavour.  Tracy and I first started off with Nat Sherman's pipe tobacco, and to be honest, this was my carrot to lead her into trying cigars, along with Tatiana Vanillas.  We'd love to take a trip to the Nat Sherman HQ on 5th Ave. in NY.

You can't miss a La Estrella if you see one; the wrappers are cured in red wine resulting in a deep scarlet colour, and they also have a shaggy foot.  Where to begin?  The flavour of this cigar has just a hint of spice that develops very nicely as it is smoked.  The wrapper is pleasantly sweet.  I'd parallel the "spice" flavour to that nice bite of cloves in pumpkin pie: it compliments the sweetness and doesn't compete. A great medium flavoured smoke that is perfect anytime: at the pub, hanging out on the porch or on a road trip.  An interesting bit of trivia regarding La Estrella is when you first light one up, you'll see a puff of red smoke as the foot ignites.

I got this as part of a house warming care package from my friend Tony that I met through Cigar Bid.  La Vieja Habana (which I think translates into "The Havana Life"), is the best traits of La Estrella Cubana and Baccarat, with it's own personality thrown into the mix.  The cigar is a little bit spicy, a little bit sweet, and a little hint of citrus.  Great earthy flavour development, even burn, awesome construction, and from what I saw in the CI catalog,  very  affordable price.  I definitely recommend this cigar for newbies and veterans alike!

A good porch cigar, it takes my friends about three cigarettes with rest breaks in between to equal the time I take with one of these.  Very smooth and well bodied overall.

      Maker: Astral Ring Size: 6.5"x44 Strength: Mild Our Rating: 7 out of 10 Comments: I'm a firm believer that every cigar has it's place, and with the exception of truly low quality cigars, there's no such thing as a bad cigar.  The Astral Candela is mild, and a little too mild for my tastes, but would be perfect for a someone just starting out trying cigars.  The Candela is a little bit spicey, but not spicey enough for my tastes.  This is unmistakably, a great quality and very well constructed cigar with a great draw; however, I think I could only really enjoy these if I was really in the mood for a very mild cigar.  Again, this is just my personal opinion recorded for posterity, so don't let it discourage one from trying it for oneself!  This cigar deserves someone to appreciate it and with my tastes for more medium to strong flavoured cigars, I'm not very suited... the 7 out of 10 rating is my personal preferance, not the rating of a panel or an expert.

The Indian Tabac Maduro would definately go well with a dark beer such as Guinness, as I realized while drinking Killian's Irish Red, which didn't compliment the flavour of this cigar at all.  The flavours developed well as the cigar was smoked, but did get a little on the harsh side towards the end.  Overall, the cigar seemed to have a sort of "smokey" or "toasted" flavour.

      Maker: Not Sure Size: Gran Duque(8"x52), Torpedo(6"x52), Wavell(5"x50) Strength: Mild to Medium Our Rating: 7 out of 10  Comments: Nice woody notes with a hint of creaminess but not overly rich, and with a very affordable price tag, I could easily see this becoming a staple in my stable.  Good construction, nice draw... this is just the epitome of a "nice" cigar.  It's like having white cake with no icing... you could keep eating it forever and not get sick of the taste.  One of our most favourite cigars is Nat Sherman, which is sort of the opposite... rich like cheese cake and if you kept having it, you'd either get gout or get sick of it.

      Maker: Nick Perdomo Ring Size: Descartes (7"x50), Ecuacion (4.7"x50), Exponente (6"x43), Milenario (6.5"x55), Rhombus (5.5"x54), Torfecto (5.5"x54) Strength: Solid Medium Our Rating: 8 out of 10 Comments:  This was a solid cigar; excellent flavour development, slight coffee taste, nice even burn and beautiful construction.  The wrapper is pleasantly oily, and is a great example of the characteristics of a maduro cigar.  Because the Perdomo 2 (which is pronounced Perdomo squared, but computer keyboards don't have exponent keys) is box pressed, it's got a nice shape and a nice draw, but a firm wrapping.  Definately a 'buy again' cigar, and a great smoke when watching a DVD with friends (such as Kill Bill).

      Maker:  Felipe Gregorio Ring Size:  Robusto (5”x50), Toro (6”x50), Torpedo (6”x54), Churchill (7”x48) Strength:  Weak to Mild Our Rating:  2 out of 10 Comments:  Fighting Cock is one of those cigars that had a really bad rep, and you just keep thinking to yourself, “It can’t be that bad”.  Well, in this case, it is.  Fighting Cock is, basically, all cock and no balls.  It’s so mild that it’s spineless, and the flavour was pretty nonexistent.  There was a foul smell though as soon as I lit it up, and it smelled like a bowling alley.  The cigar was almost plugged in the middle, but loose at both ends.  The wrapper is well constructed, but that doesn’t really make up for the lack of decent content.

      Maker:  Augusto Reyes Ring Size: Corona (5.5”x42), Robusto (5”x50), Toro (6”x50), Churchill (7”x48) Strength:  Mild to Medium Our Rating: 8.5 out of 10  Comments:  This is as mild as you can get and still call it a medium cigar.  The flavor doesn’t really develop, but instead it tastes very good from the time you light up until you throw the nub away.  The price is a total steal; making it a good choice for road trips, after dinner or anytime really.  This was really a total surprise considering all the bad stories that we’ve heard about Professor Sila.

This is the epitome, to me, of a mild to medium cigar.

Excellent construction, reliable quality and a slightly sweet but solidly medium flavour make Baccarat one of our staple cigars.  Baccarat is the quintessential “anytime cigar”, perfect for the pub, after a meal, golfing, fishing or just sitting on the patio shooting the breeze.

      Maker:  Victor Sinclair Ring Size:  Strength:  Medium Our Rating: 6.5 out of 10 Comments:  Both Tracy and I prefer the Red version of this cigar.  It was ok, but just not as tasty.  Usually we’re very into maduros, but the Bohemian Black was very one dimensional and flat, much like soda without fizz.  There wasn’t really any flavour development either, and the cigar kept much the same taste the whole stick.    Perhaps it was aged a little to long; expect an update after we smoke a few more to make up our minds.

They respond well to aging, or can just be smoked right out of the box.  Originally designed to be an after dinner smoke, these cigars do taste very, very good on a full stomach (even if the meal was just pizza and beer).

      Maker:  Jochy Blanco Ring Size: Toro (6”x50), Churchill (7.5”x50), Torpedo (6.5”x52) Strength:  Mild My Rating: 8 out of 10 Comments:  This cigar is mild without being gutless, and was a very enjoyable summer evening smoke.  With a little bit of sweetness on the cap, and a great CT shade wrapper house decent quality tobacco.  Reasonably priced, this is one of those “I feel like a mild cigar” picks.

      Maker: Drew Estate Size: Corona (5"x42) Strength: Flavoured Rating: 9 1/2 out of 10 Comments:&nbsp; This delicous little cigar is positively a dream!&nbsp; The only reason why it's not a "10" is that there was minor tunnelling, but the construction is otherwise good.&nbsp; Creamy creme brulee and silky Kahlua are the dominate flavours in this smoke (good thing, considering the name!).&nbsp; There is a wonderful aroma of brownies or&nbsp;chocolate cake that&nbsp;surrounds the&nbsp;area where the cigar is smoked.&nbsp;&nbsp;This cigar is just lovely and a real pleasure to enjoy; there is&nbsp;little wonder that these 'gars are&nbsp;going fast on both the C-bid&nbsp;site and Cigars International proper.

      Maker: CAO  Size: 4"x30  Strength: Flavoured  Rating: 9 1/2 out of 10  Comments: Tatiana, our favourite flavoured cigar, has some serious competition now!&nbsp; Vanilla heaven, made with premium tobaccos (unlike most flavoured cigars).&nbsp; With a great scent of yellow cake,&nbsp;these are defiantly "crowd pleaser" cigars.&nbsp; They carry the same price tag as Tatianas, are made with slightly more quality and are seemingly more readily available.&nbsp; These little smokes beg to be enjoyed at the pub and shared with friends.

I remember seeing an ad in  Maxim  for these cigars, that threw in a free desk top humidor.  Not a bad deal.  :)

      Follow up to my entry on Monday, June 21, 2004...  Wow!  These little cigars benefitted from being put down for awhile in the coolerdor.  The strong, pungent taste mellowed into a very nice cocoa and coffee flavour, with some background notes of spice.  It's amazing how laying down cigars changes their flavour, even if it is only aged for a month.  I'm going to have to get another box of these and set 'em down to age for winter consumption.  :D
