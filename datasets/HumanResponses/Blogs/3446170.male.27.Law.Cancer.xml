      Hipsters CAN be annoying sometimes. Especially those prone to making statements to show off how hip they are and how much they know about stuff, when in fact their "opinions" are actually ripped off or informed by another so called "hipster" who happen to write for a "hip" magazine like CMJ, UNCUT, SPIN, Q, ROLLING STONE, etc.  I read a letter in the KLUE letters page where a so called hipster name drops Franz Ferdinand and The Zutons among others to ridicule some fellah who disagreed with a KLUE review on the Incubus gig (BTW, I don't like Incubus that much either). I wasn't at the gig, so I don't know who's right or wrong (because I don't like Incubus that much, see?). But don't you think that before you make statements or drop names like that you should've at least explored enough music or whatever your field of choice is before you do make some sort of statement? I know that Franz Ferdinand is THE band to like right now (for hipsters lah. For us normal people, there's always Incubus and Linkin' Park, he he), but I always hear hipsters say that they sound like The Strokes, when what I most associate them with is Orange Juice (remember that band, with Edwyn Collins?) and the rest of the Postcard Records gang like the Nectarine No. 9 (and believe me, I very rarely hear or maybe have never even heard any of these "hipsters" pronounce their love for the Postcard gang). So why the sudden change? Because hipsters are sheep too (maybe a little bit more informed sheep) and I am the  LAW !! And to say that you think The Zutons is IT, don't you think that you should've at least listened to the one of those Nuggets compilations and at least know who The Seeds, Count Five or The Nazz are? I know I'm doing some name dropping myself, but then, I am the  LAW !  So guys, remember, do your research. Then you can brag and show off like me. Tomorrow or next week, we will start our lesson on the history and splendor of the cinema, maybe some music too if teacher feels like it. Until then my flock of sheep, adios....

      It's raining pretty hard outside. Damn, wanted to get home quick. Bought 4 new DVDs today - Bubba Ho Tep, Shaun of the Dead, Zatoichi, The Warriors. I know, naughty! Wanted to get home fast and put them on. Can't wait to see Bruce Campbell as The King kicking a Mummy's ass. Should be fun.  To the lonely bugger who's officially the first person to post a comment here, congratulations man!!! You even beat my girl to the punch. So now, you'll have to be my bitch. Woo hoooooooooo!! I'm gonna run you ragged!!  So,  STATEMENT OF INTENT : This particular blog will mostly cater to my masturbatory fantasy of being a film critic, as I've long been a little bit of a  "cinephile" . I will, from this point forward, be showing off my vast knowledge of the cinema, past, present and future. And you, o unworthy clueless flock of sheep, shall bow and listen to my comments and recommendations, for I am the  LAW !!  Okay then everyone. Please tune in once in a while and remember,  I AM THE LAW !!!

      After such a long wait, I finally got to see this film i.e. Peter the Pirate has finally got hold of a copy of its DVD!! Thank god they got it, for this film, along with Matchstick Men, The Station Agent, Mystic River, PTU and a few others I can't list off the top of my head, is certainly one of the best films of last year.  But no, don't run yet. This is in no way a 'slow' movie. Unless you're so PC you get easily offended in case someone says "fuck-stick" or "cocksucker", this movie will entertain you in ways you can't possibly imagine. The script, I simply can't praise enough. It's very, very vulgar, yes. But I howled so much with laughter, I sometimes feel ashamed of myself for doing it. You can't even count how many times the word 'fuck' is used in the film. I assure you, you'll lose count after 10 minutes or so into the film. And what they do with the characters is simply fearless. Lauren Graham (the hot mom in Gilmore Girls, and FYI, is still HOT here), for example plays a bartender who has a Santa fetish that when she shags Santa (Billy Bob Thornton), she makes him wear his Santa hat whilst screaming "Fuck me Santa! Fuck me Santa!" repeatedly!! Santa himself does so many outrageous things, you'll be wondering why in the hell do you think all these things are funny. Example? Well, he tends to piss his pants quite a lot. I know, is that funny? Well wait till you see the movie and then you tell me.  So some of the stars you already know. The director is Terry Zwigoff (of 'Crumb' and 'Ghost World' fame). The script is by the guys who last wrote 'Cats & Dogs'. I know!! Cats & Dogs!! But this one's so good, I'm already tempted to see 'Cats & Dogs' again just to see what I've missed.  The story? It's about 2 criminals whose M.O. every year is to pose as Santa and one of his elves in a department store and then rob it when everyone goes home for the holidays. Santa then encounters one troubled kid who may or may not teach him a thing or two about Christmas. So the story sounds normal enough. But believe me, even the most potentially cliched things, like what makes the kid so troubled and fucked up, is presented with humility, freshness and surprise without a single ounce of the schmaltz we've come to expect from movies of this kind. For me this film is truly a perfect example of when "art" and "commerce" goes hand in hand in perfect complement of each other.  I loved every single thing about the movie. It may be, for the most part, 'mean-spirited' or 'nasty' or 'vulgar', but just when you are about to make up your mind on that, it reveals its spirit and its humanity to you. And you'll love it more after that. I can't recommend this film high enough. But do yourself a favour and see it. A fucked up darling, that's what I'd call it. (9 out of 10 stars)

      Saw the film  "Miracle" , of all things, last night. I know. A lot of you must be scratching your heads, asking, why? It's a Disney movie, so that's usually not a good sign. It's a sports movie, another worrying sign. That's why I was wary at first too. But I read somewhere that this film's getting a 2-disc DVD release. It's not a huge money maker like LXG, or Bad Boys 2, or T3. It's not a critically acclaimed film like Pulp Fiction or anything like that. So there must be something special about it to warrant a release like that. So I checked it out.  First of all, the director is Gavin O Connor, who last did the film 'Tumbleweeds'. And the lead actor is Kurt Russell, who gives a fantastic performance that should've at least won him some sort of acting nomination. I'm not sure what year this film is released in, but if it's 2004, I hope he gets an acting nod in the next Oscars. It would be a shame if he didn't.  The story? It's about the miraculous feat of the 1980 USA Olympics Ice Hockey team beating the Soviets in the semi-finals and later winning the gold. Smell the cheese anyone? I can definitely tell you one thing, this film is so unhip, it hurts. But you'll be surprised how good it is if you see it.   First of all, I think the filmmakers did a little bit of pre-flashing on the negative of the film before shooting because the film has this very authentic washed out look of the late 70s and early 80s films. Sometimes the colours look normal, but more often than not, this muted look is what you'll get. There are no fancy camera moves, but plenty of handheld ones to make it a bit more realistic. I definitely like the 'look' of the film.  The most surprising thing is that the films chose to focus on the coach, Herb (played by Kurt Russell). The players are all young, good looking guys, but the film chose to not dwell in who they are, or what their problems are, thus evading cliches like winning the final = winning back girlfriend, or winning the final = proving to everyone that you're not a dweeb, or winning the final = getting money to fund your terminally ill little brother's operation. Another ballsy move by the filmmakers.  The next thing is, THERE ARE NO VILLAINS!! The Soviet players are not bad guys (in any sense of the word, be it bullies or whatever), they are just another opponent. Even the hysteria (and political and emotional weight) surrounding the US team's dream run to the Gold medal is played down. It is strictly about the coach, and his obsession to build a TEAM. And that's it. If you ask me, that is pretty radical and ballsy in films like this.  You can even say that this film is actually a sort of character study on the coach, which I think is brilliantly done, because he is NEVER presented as a hero. He's obsessed with getting what he wants, can be very insensitive (even to his wife!!), and even downright cruel. You do get a well rounded character here, and as I said before, Kurt Russell is amazing here. You believe him 100%. The film IS centered around him and he carries it effortlessly.  My only complaints are the over-enthusiastic score, the little bit more effort that could be made to acquaint us with the players, and the sometimes pedestrian cinematography, especially during the training and the hockey games.  But all in all, a good movie with a fantastic performance that's worth checking out. 3 out of 4 stars.

      I saw 50 First Dates last night on DVD. Wasn't able to catch it while it was playing in the cinema. I was expecting something like The Wedding Singer, but I've never expected it would be this good. In a better world, critics would be raving about this movie. But since it's an Adam Sandler movie, with a kind of journeyman director, Peter Segal, it will never get the credit it deserves.  I laughed a lot. Smiled a lot. Felt pretty warm and lovey-dovey inside. And was quite surprised to see the way the director handled the movie. He's restrained when he has to, especially during the ending, which could've easily been silly or overtly soppy. And his timing for the gross-out jokes was fantastic too. Even the scene transitions are sometimes startingly creative.   There's a tender quality to the film that will surprise a lot of people. Sandler and Barrymore shares this incredible on screen chemistry, so much so that you wholeheartedly believe that they're in love, despite the far-fetched premise of 1 day short-term memory loss. The guy who plays Barrymore's dad too has this wonderful humanity to him, that you can't help but care for these people. In short, they do look and feel like real people. It's not easy to find this humanity in films, let alone a mainstream romantic comedy.  And who can forget Ula (Rob Schneider) and Sean Astin as Barrymore's brother. Sure, they're caricatures of very obvious types. So you can sometimes spot the jokes from a mile away. But they'll still make you laugh. Now isn't that a sign of a successful joke, dumb or not? I sometimes pity those so called 'intellectual' people with supposedly better 'taste' in art who prefer 'intelligent' British comedy like the Monthy Python guys or Black Adder, or things like that. I really fail to see what's so 'intelligent' with that. They're still dumb jokes. Only delivered with a British accent, that's all. You call that 'wit'? I don't think so. Anyway, I'll talk more about this later.  Back to the film, if this was a French movie, I think it will get a lot more respect from critics and casual audiences simply because it's French, and foreign language movies are always 'classier'.   I just loved it. I might analyse films a bit too much (technically or artistically) when I see them. But still my response to them are always in a 'visceral' way instead of 'intellectually'. I simply want to believe, be moved, and be dazzled by the craft. You see the chronology? Believe first, moved second, and craft last. Film rating? 7 and a half out of 10. Go see it folks if you haven't. It's simply marvellous.

      Went to a gig last Saturday. Malay language songs only. Naturally, I had to check it out and see what sort of bands and sounds would be there. I only know 3 of the bands playing. But things like this don't happen much, so what the heck. Guess what, it turned out to be quite an entertaining experience, although 'entertaining' sometimes can be interpreted in an unusual, or different context. Example, William Hung - entertaining? Hell yes!!! Good? I don't think so. So there's quite a few moments like that during the gig.  The funniest part? One of the bands had a 'backing vocalist', who held the mic as if he's the lead singer, seemed very clueless throughout their entire set (this even though he was reading from a lyric sheet most of the time), and couldn't hit the right notes even if his life depended on it!! Damn, that WAS funny. You know what, the band even had the balls to play their own songs, one of which sounds uncannily like Creep by Radiohead, except with Malay lyrics, and they were howling the melodies so madly, it kind of turned into a guilty pleasure, he he!! I hope Thom Yorke never gets the chance to hear it, otherwise a lawsuit would be quite possible. He he, sorry guys!!  Then there's the fantastic pleasure of hearing quite a few decent Indo-rock songs being butchered. That was surreal too. There's even a metal band with a singer who shrieks as if he's the lead singer of Helloween or Iron Maiden!! Boy, you guys sure missed a lot by missing the gig.  All in, I think there were only 2 good, worthwhile bands that night. One was Nadia's Picture Show. Sure, they're as Indo sounding as they come, but they look good on stage, they're tight, a killer lead guitarist, and some of the songs do sound great. I even bought their demo, but I have to admit, the songs sound much better live than on CD. I just hope the lead singer will work on hitting the high notes as sometimes he did seem to struggle too much with it. But this band could be huge if they play their cards right.  The other band was D_va. I know, kinda cheesy name. But their original songs are quite a delight, especially "Sentiasa". That will surely be a hit if they get signed.  Then there's this band called Ratu. An old friend of mine plays bass with them. The singer's girlfriend just signed with Broadway Entertainment, so Mr Boon Tan was there to see them play. Their songs are not bad, but I just thought that they tried too hard to impress that night. But you girls are gonna love their lead singer. Blonde hair, good looking, with some sense of style, he's definitely got the package. Can't say the same for his bandmates though. Cowboy hats, the pub band look. Whew, I thought my band was bad!! I know, naughty!! Sorry guys!! I hope you never read this!!  Had dinner with the D_va guys. Boon Tan joined us as well. I think it's quite enlightening and refreshing to hang out with a bunch of people who have no qualms about signing with a record label, as opposed to the normal 'underground' types. The D_va guys seemed alright. But the Ratu guys kinda of worries me cause they seem too eager to sign, which is always a bad sign, as you're never going to think straight when you're too into something. But what the hell, they might even be making lots of dough and groupies by next year. Who knows?  The lowdown? It was quite an experience. I just felt sad that not even one of the hipster Malaise or KLUE gang was there. Goes to show how 'united' our local non-mainstream scene is.

      Watched shitload of movies last week. Will do a capsule review of each one for your reference. Here we go!!   LOST IN TRANSLATION  Bought this DVD a long time ago but finally saw it, as I was really bored out of my mind. I really had high hopes for this, having heard all the hype and having already liked Sofia Coppola's debut, The Virgin Suicides. But sadly, I think this is a very empty movie. It's just full of pretty images of mainly the 2 leads moping around looking bored and 'lost'. But that's about it. It's pretty funny at times. But I just think that it's got no soul. Shame, really. Overrated dross for hipsters to love...   VERONIKA VOSS  Directed by Rainer Weiner Fassbinder and part of the BRD trilogy. Another very 'cold' movie. It's impossibly gorgeous to look at though. The black and white cinematography, and the scene transitions are absolutely stunning. The only problem is that I never 'cared' for the characters. The story is interesting enough, a kind of remake of Sunset Boulevard, but I think the script should be worked on more.   HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN  Lined up for about an hour to get tickets for this. I like it. The direction by Alfonso Cuaron is way more imaginative than Chris Colombus'. But 'darker' doesn't necessarily equals great, so I'd have to say that as a whole, I still find the first H. Potter movie the most special one. I can return to it as many times as I want and still not get bored. It doesn't mean that this movie blows, not by any chance is it that. I'd give it 7 out of 10 stars, which means it's very good, maybe even great, but not near 'special' enough. Please, go see it anyway. The time turner set-piece is absolutely awesome. Well done, Mr Cuaron.   THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW  Awesome destruction, characters you care about, involving stories, but it kinda withers a bit near the end. A very good popcorn movie nonetheless. Definitely worth your money and time.   SONNY  Nicolas Cage's directorial debut, and it's surprisingly sad and affectionate. The story has been told many times before. A gigolo wants to go straight. Only, the 'madame' is his own mother. But the script works out plenty amounts of tenderness, anguish and frustration. And the direction is usually non-intrusive, which suits the material well. There's only one very dodgily shot scene, the only one where I think Mr Cage made an error of judgment. But the rest is pretty easy to like. And the performances, especially by Harry Dean Stanton, are pretty good too. So go look it up folks. It's definitely not the best of films. Has quite a few flaws too. But I kind of love the sloppy, affectionate tone of it. Rating? 7/10. Kind of special, but flawed.   SPARTAN  Bloody brilliant political thriller by David Mamet, the master of cinematic mind games. Someone's daughter (the President? The movie never confirms who) went missing, and the CIA, Secret Service etc are out to look for her. That's the whole plot right there. But it's beautifully told, complete with twists and turns and even political conspiracy and paranoia. Should've been a hit. Exciting from start to finish. It's a pity Warner Bros. didn't really go all out with promoting it.

      I've been naughty last weekend. Went to Tower Records KL and found this wonderful bargain bin full of Tower Singapore "write-off" CDs for RM9.90 each. Haven't been this excited since I rummaged through Notting Hill Gate's Music Exchange bargain basements practically every day of the week when I was studying in London.  Bought a few CDs too. I found some long-desired CDs that I simply couldn't afford (or couldn't find) when they first came out. Bought the album Sparking Ray Gun by MARS NEEDS WOMEN. Always read about them in power pop 'zines but have never seen their CD before. Now I got it, for RM9.90!!! Not really a big deal. Pretty good Enuff Znuff & Cheap Trick inspired power pop, which means it rocks and kicks your ass big time. Maybe I need more time to get acquainted with them.  Also got Mock Heroic by ADMIRAL TWIN. Now this I like. Reminds me of people like Brian Leach, Weird Summer, Sugarbuzz and maybe some Swirl 360. Adult power pop, if you want to call it that. It maybe is a little bit over-produced, since it is on a major label, but there are some totally irresistible songs on it that I keep on playing like mad, like "Better Than Nothing At All". Keeps me smiling even though I've been rather glum lately cause I miss my baby....  Then there's WESTON and their major label debut. They were from this time when the American punk underground were charmed by a select group of bands like Discount and Sicko, who merged pop-punk with a little bit of indie-rock a la Superchunk. I expected more of the same at first. But when I put this CD on I was absolutely stunned, because this CD strongly reminds me of Jimmy Eat World's masterwork, their album titled "Clarity". It's truly a wonder why this album, or this band for that matter, are rarely mentioned by emo fans today. They're not as musically proficient as J.E.W but they're pretty close!!! I've always had a soft spot for pop punk and emo, so I'm sure this CD will be popped into the CD player quite often.  And last but not least, the gold mine, the holy grail, is the self titled CD by THE WAKING HOURS. When this came out, people in the power pop fraternity were raving and drooling all over this band. But their CD was only available on Import, and cost about GBP18.99 so I really couldn't afford it. What a fool I've been for this CD is almost EXACTLY what I currently want to achieve with my band, 'couple'. It is the most perfect, awesome and jaw dropping blend of American power pop and Britpop I've ever heard. Just imagine The Shazam, The Heartdrops and Phantom Planet all rolled into one perfect combination. It kicks ass, it makes you smile, it makes you go all gooey, it has everything for every mood. They just released a new CD independently and you can bet my ass I'm gonna get it. Hallelujah!!! What a fool, huh? What a fool...  You may probably be wondering by now, when the hell will this smart-ass write about the cinema, like he said he would. Well, my wonderful flock of sheep, all I can say is, patience.... Have some patience. Teacher's not in the mood yet to talk about the cinema. But worry not, teacher will....

       Been a while since my last post. Work has been quite hellish. It kinda sucks being the most junior lawyer in your firm as you just get the most 'rotten' and 'hopeless' of files dumped on you for you to deal with. And that does suck, big time!  &nbsp;  Went to Singapore about 2 weeks ago to play the Baybeats Festival at the Esplanade with my band. Still get 'visions' of that wonderful trip from time to time. It was just so lovely, going to play in a different country, with your good friends. It's so much nicer that my other half came along as well. Our first trip together, and it was dreamy.  &nbsp;  Our show was more than we could've asked for. We played on Sunday, 18/7/2004 at 8.00pm. I heard complaints from other bands about how the monitors suck, or could be better. As for me, the whole band in fact, we just LOVED the fact that we can now, for the first time ever in our quite long career as performers, totally hear ourselves on the monitors clearly. I could clearly hear my voice AND my guitar! Usually it's either one or the other, most often it would be the latter leaving me just gambling and hoping that I'd sing in tune. But not during Baybeats!! So from our point of view it was already excellent.  &nbsp;  Then came the crowd reception during our performance, which surprised the hell out of me, and is most definitely a delight to everyone in the band. The crowd cheered, clapped, applauded, smiled, laughed, some sang along, there was even a guy right up front who danced all the way through our set. I then spent about an hour plus after the show just talking to people who came up to say hi or congratulate or buy CDs or ask for autographs!! Almost everyone who came up said that they loved the fact that we sounded so different and so fresh from everything else now. Which kinda of baffles me, but also made sense because no one seemed to WANT to play pop songs anymore right now, especially in Malaysia. So it was definitely a night to remember. We got paid $200 Sing. So $50 for each band member, which meant I had more money to buy DVDs & VCDs!! More about that later.  &nbsp;  Stayed at a backpacker's hostel. Cheap too. And filled with beautiful, half naked,&nbsp;tourists walking around with not a care in the world!! It's at a great location to boot. Mamak downstairs, shopping mall & MRT station across the street, bus stop right in front, 7-eleven round the corner, in short it was pretty easy to get around. The soundcheck on Sunday practically robbed a whole day's worth of wandering around. But I did find some great DVD, CD&nbsp;& VCD places. Bought 5 DVDs,  Shock Corridor ,  The Naked Kiss ,  Night and Fog in Japan ,  Giants &amp; Toys ,  Band of Outsiders . Also bought 2 VCDs,  Divine Intervention  &  The 400 Blows . Blew a big hole in my pocket, but definitely worth it. I only bought Last Days Of April's latest CD during Baybeats, but it's good. And finally got to buy Love's best of compilation at a 50% discount at Borders, which was a sweet deal.  &nbsp;  Wish I'm there right now, wandering the streets. Will definitely go there again in the near future. Hope we'll get invited for another show there, which is a possibility, since I made quite a lot of new friends there. Anyway, till my next post, ta!

      Watched a lot of movies last week and the week before. So to save time & space, I'll do double reviews!! Here we go.   THE TERMINAL vs. KITCHEN STORIES  The Terminal was directed by Steven Spielberg. You know who he is. Kitchen Stories was directed by Bent Hamer. When I saw Riddick a couple of weeks back, the trailer for The Terminal showed and needless to say I was very excited to see it. From the looks of the trailer it might just be one of my favourite films this year. Despite it being a nice enough film, I can't say that it will be in my top 10 list come the end of this year. Why? Just see Kitchen Stories, a little film from Sweden (I think, or maybe Norway), and you'll see what Spielberg was trying to do with The Terminal and why I think he didn't get it right. If you've seen the trailer or even read a bit about the film, you'll know that Spielberg was trying to do a 'little film' with a little bit of quirkiness and a large dose of humanity thrown in. The film's sweet, funny, human (yes!), but yet you feel there's something missing. I just think he didn't nail the various tones and moods needed to pull it off exactly right. With these kind of films, I think, you either nail it and make a wonderful small miracle, or you end up halfway there, leaving something missing. As for Kitchen Stories, all I can say is, go see it. It has an ingeniously clever idea as a set up, and it takes its own sweet time to tell its story. Just hang in there and after about 15-20 minutes, you'll be hooked, and you will marvel at the simplicity and economy of its storytelling, and how the director gave you just enough to make your own conclusions and observations (it's a film about 'observation', in the most literal sense of the word), without shoving anything down your throat. It's truly a little wonder of a film. Love it!!  Rating: The Terminal (6 1/2 out of 10); Kitchen Stories (8 out of 10)   JIANG HU vs. ENTER THE PHOENIX  The future looks bright for Hong Kong cinema. Wong Ching Po (director of Jiang Hu) and Stephen Fung (director of Enter The Phoenix) are both incredibly young to be film directors of such great confidence. But you've got to hand it to them, they ARE good. Jiang Hu tells a story that's nothing new. It has some sort of a 'twist', but 3/4 into the film, you can kinda see it already. But all that does not matter, because Jiang Hu, first and foremost, is a visually exciting film, where the director is willing to do anything to make the shots and scenes look good. Example? In one scene where 2 people are dining facing each other on a long table, you'll suddenly realise that the background seem to be moving and you'll realise the only way this shot will be possible is for the table to be placed on a wheeled ramp that is moved around. Why go to such trouble, you ask? Isn't it unrealistic? Well, why not? It looks beautiful, so why not? Now that's only one of many fancy camera moves and shots in the film. The massacre at the end of the film is absolutely gorgeous. Shot in the rain and in slo-mo, it rivals some of Wong Kar Wai's most poetic moments. And this guy doesn't even have a Christopher Doyle to help him!! I eagerly await Mr Wong Ching Po's next film, that's for sure. As for Enter The Phoenix, it's also interesting visually, but it's winning point is in the flawless shifts in tone between a normal gangster film, and a spoof of a gangster film. The humor is absolutely hilarious most of the time. My favourite? Karen Mok asks Edison Chen since when did he knew that he was gay. Flashback: We see a doctor holding a thermometer and a young boy's bum in one shot, then pan to the boy's face while the doctor sticks the thermometer up the boy's ass, we see the boy with a satisfied and cheeky smile. Hilarious!! After Tsui Hark and John Woo being gone to Hollywood, it seems like the only hope for Hong Kong cinema would be Johnnie To and the Milkyway Image gang (apart from Wong Kar Wai and Fruit Chan, that is). But here we have now, 2 bright young directors, with a style and personality of their own. Let's hope the money men won't corrupt them. Rating: Jiang Hu (8 out of 10); Enter The Phoenix (7 out of 10)

      Hey there folks! Haven't updated the blog for more than a week now. Got lots of stuff to tell you guys. But first, I'll be organising a gig called 'rubbish on the radio' this coming Saturday. Here are the details:  Date: Saturday, 10th July 2004 Venue: Paul's Place, Uptown (very near to the Kedai Telekom) Time: Doors open at 4pm Cover: RM10 Bands playing:   COUPLE  My own band. Kick ass power pop to rock sama lu punya ass!! Think The Beatles meets The Beach Boys meets The Who, and you'll get there eventually.   FREE LOVE  Indie rock darlings from Ipoh. Beloved by both the hip crowd and the 'normal' ones.   BONELESS MAHONEY  Geek rock obsessed band from Gopeng. They used to be mad about Weezer and The Rentals. Lately they seem to be mad about Ozma. Plus I hear they're now singing in Bahasa Malaysia!!   LUCY IN THE LOO  If you happen to like Letters To Cleo and the Josie & The Pussycats movie soundtrack, don't miss this band. Indie pop/rock from Bangi with a female singer. Always a plus with anyone!! And, the singer's got a great voice!!   THE COFFEESHOP  Pop kids from KL & Kajang. Ramzi's brother is the bassist here.   D_VA  I know, kinda lame name. But don't be shocked if you see them in URTV or Mangga anytime soon, 'cause these guys (with a girl singer) have the potential to be big. Indie pop sung in Malay.   NADIA'S PICTURE SHOW  My current favourite local underground Malay language band. Imagine Indo rock tampered a bit with emo stylings. Plus the singer's voice reminds me of Gigi's singer.   RETURN TO FALL  A last minute addition from Singapore. Haven't heard their music, but since they'll be in town and asked to play, I thought, why not? I heard the singer's from Denmark, so a Mat Salleh's presence could always help with the hipster crowd. Plus people say that they play dreamy indie pop, so that shouldn't be so bad.  So, my dear flock of sheep. Why don't you get off your usual diet of The Rasmus and give these bands a try. I assure you, this is prime ass I'm talking about here, if these bands were a girl. So come on down and say hi to me later. Ta!!
