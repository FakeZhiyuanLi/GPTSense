      my lama teachers seemed pleased to see the organic chocolate but humbly tried to return the cash in the card which i wrongly anticipated they'd open after our meeting.  i insisted they keep the cash (hope this showed no disrespect), they said they'd donate it to the fish release project. but not the chocolate please, i said.   for apparent chocolate imbibers, they both look glowingly healthy, exceedingly young, light and joyful.  i bump into them in the produce isles quite often and would bet they are natural cronies all on their own, and without even a thought.  india is again on my itinerary. a serious pilgrimage to sacred land would be a once abandoned dream come true, a chance to offer a few mangos and mantras for known and esp any previous unknown misdeeds.  now i'm even more inspired to cron, as a trip of that nature will require top health.  juxtaposing yesterdays events, today was quite wordly.  took a friend to a strange and very beautiful movie (spring, summer, fall, winter...and spring) for her birthday and afterwards she wanted to go out to lunch. the least caloric and healthiest offering on the menu about finishes off my food for the day, being that it cost an arm and a leg in calories.    a huge salad with kidney beans, hard boiled egg, half a small avocado, tomato slices, croutons, about a pound and a half of romaine. and who knows what was in that sweet creamy poppy seed dressing? ok, i also ate the immense hunk of crusty grainy bread served with it.  hey, i'd ordered the fresh melon slices as an exchange.  but since they evidently forgot, i took it as a sign and went ahead with it. the worst that could happen is that later or tomorrow i'll run hogwild in residual carb cravings.    i figure the salad tower plus bread came to a whopping 850 cals.  i feel immediately older. if it wouldn't have offended my birthday friend i would have ordered a latte instead. adding the hundred for my morning tea makes 950 for the day.  i am not a big fan of eating out and definately look foreward to my regular purple and blueberry medley plain yogurt lunch tomorrow.  btw, a BERRY HB to our very own April!!!    wonder how one crons in india?

      two days ago i spiraled down to sweet whitefood  funk for about four hours.  only 2 subsequent days of yogurt and lots of blue-purpley berries have rocketted me back up to my normal cheery level, in spite of being swept over in nervous exictement for a big nite later tonight and an unexpected visit  from aunt ruby. i'm almost 50, no kids and no plans to make any. you'd think she'd stop coming around.   i just keep spiraling upward. out buying flowers and organic  chocolate for special people like lama's and office workers and whatever people i like. heck, i'm giving  cash to streetfolk that usually annoy me.  have you ever  seen a streetperson on a cell phone?  that was a new one  on me today.   a two cup plain yogurt from trader joes has 240 calories and 24 grams of protein, for $1.09.  a pound of the berry medley for 210 calories and 6 grams protein is $2.29.  blueberries, raspberries and marionberries. the most delicious, easy and cheap lunch AND afternoon snack. i love a little cinnamon and stevia sprinkled in. chilled in the freezer about half an hour.  the bar of organic dark chocolate sits in the freezer now for an offerring to my teachers tonight. i arranged a consultation to ask their opinions about the karma of my body, plus a family karma question.  btw, i forgot  to clarify, i have cp from birth.  truly speaking, the cp seems an easy challenge compared to  alot of snags i used to get into with food (pre-cron), but i'm not about to forgo this fortunate opportunity to examine it with such fine teachers. and between you and i, if it were anyone else,  that chocolate would have never lasted this long in the freezer.  besides the yogurt and berries, i'm doing my family sized salad with black beans for dinner.  calories for the day will total 880, with 55 gms protein.

      my heel needs oxygen to heal. wouldn't hurt the vision project either.  or the brain damage. that would be GREEN food. fresh outdoor air. pranayama.    ironically,  the asphyxic nature of my birth, with subsequent brain damage, i believe impaires  my ability to always make wise food choices.   ha. good try.    yesterday i wandered through an endless "emotion nutrition" day, which we all know emotionally backfires 100 fold five minutes after.   total food samsara....cold, creamy, sweet white junk. and later,  crunchy white junk.  never mind specifics, but i wish at least it  had been a hot steamy latte.  gorgeous heads of romaine sit in the fridge.  i love romaine!!!    rebellious action will NOT help this project afai can see.  am i not on my OWN side???  YES. i am.  fortunally i managed to keep it just below 1000 c's, drank quarts of water, got a fair amount of oxygenation through movement and steered clear of the tv and computer all day. slept deep all night with the open window beside me, but overslept an hour...and still, i need the eyeglasses as i write this.   i can live without any more cran research days.  here's the plan today:  tea w/ 1/2 & 1/2 small apple 2 c. blueberries  2 c. cottage cheese      4 c. romaine fat free vinegarette 1 c. cooked pink beans 1.5 c. broccoli 793 cal  83gm. prot  ..............

      one initial goal is vision improvement.  last year the reading  glasses came...first only for evening reading.  this year i need  them for any close up reading. can't make out the calorie contents in the grocery anymore. i won't break down and carry those glasses everywhere i go and i refuse to buy into the theory of getting stronger  glasses incrementally over time to lessen eyestrain.   my committment is to take matters into my own hands, research vision improvement techniques, and of course include all foods proven beneficial to eyesight.  right off i'm thinking eye  palming and carrots.  eye yoga videos and cucumber slice eye facials.  secondly, less teleVision watching (believe it or not, that's how i broke my foot ten weeks ago), and errr......less laptop.  : (   yesterday i LOVED my 3 meals. unusually slow, with long chewing.    tea, fatfree half n half and stevia  "emotional nutrition" (willie's term)   large apple    2 dates        huge head of chopped romaine w/fatfree vinegarette   1# steamed kale       head of chopped romaine topped with   3/4 cup pink beans and ff vinegarette   1# steamed broccoli  grand total of 750 cals. my calorie goal perameter in general is between 700-1000 for now, and eventually tightening the gap.

      a very specific and diverse selection of minimal quantity and  ONLY the most nutritionally dense food possible, with the  intention being the highest quality of life extension.  effectively proven with yeasts, flies, roundworms, rodents, dogs,  cats, primates and humans.

      the 800 c/day challenge.  past few years it's averaged around 900-1200 and being that i am about a minute from 50, it's high time i take the leap down to 800.  this coming week focusing on new cell regeneration with oxygen rich leafy greens.  today marks 10 weeks since my heel broke and it still feels funky.  swelling, dark in color, an inch of bony protrusion, stabbing pains and very limited walking.  hopefully i'll start p.t. very soon.  for now, i am taking matters into my own hands with a  very mindful course of CR in the most ON sense.  lots of juicy crunchy salad greens, with either a cooked legume or steamed green veggie like broccoli or asparagus for dinners.   lunches will be huge green salads followed by a big bowlful of steamy leafy greens of kale, chard, collards etc.   breakfasts will be my yummy black tea with fatfree 1/2 & 1/2.

      wow. during one of the sharing sessions yesterday at the retreat someone said she's working very hard at dietary changes, specifically cutting out sweets. immediately three others said they had the same lifelong problem. the discussion extended into areas we could all relate to.  feeling emotions, breaking habitual patterns, making small changes, etc.  happy to notice the next tea break, only tea was set out for us.  i am still eating my meals at home. tea with fatfree half and half for breakfast. another tea at the first break, this time with low fat milk. a big bowl of steamed veggies sprayed with olive oil for lunch.  an apple at the afternoon break. more veggies for dinner with grapes for desert.  yesterday was unusually stressful. on the way to the retreat i witnessed a very upsetting accident. luckily i didn't have to show up for a job afterwards as i was shaken all day from it.  the nature of the retreat was a safe place to really feel the experience and not have to over or undereat over it.

      good thing this retreat is so good.  makes it easy to walk past the massive plates of homemade cookies at breaktimes.  the set up requires passing through the kitchen several times a day.  after seeing all the beautiful rich dishes underway, i am again so  grateful i get to come home for my simple meals.  apples are my treat this week and that is enough.  the committment to vegetarianism there has me inspired again and i revisited dean pomerleau's website last nite in hopes i might copy his menu.  i haven't made up my mind if i have that level of committment  he has.  that's ALOT of shopping. ALOT of chopping.  in the meantime i've upped my vit k greens and cruciferous veggies. also added half a tablespoon of olive oil which is  delicious on steamed kale.  and less chicken/fish. more cottage cheese/yogurt and probably some legumes soon.

      for the next 7 days i'll be in a yoga retreat. it's very close to my home, so i'll sleep and  eat back here...which is a good thing as the  food there is way too rich for me.  and i'm so ingrained into my usual bland foods it's hard to imagine eating anything else.  i love this retreat. 7 hours of yoga and meditation every day which is about my favorite thing to do.  yesterday i cooked up a huge pot of cruceferus  soup with chicken. yummy. yogurt with cinnamon and apples for lunch. still getting apples right  off the tree.  again my calories were right at 1000.   55% carbs.  25% protein. 20% fat.

      not me. it's the one day average of michael phelps, us olympic swimmer.  that's more than any of us cr folk  eat in a week. i really loved the synchronized  diving and gymnastics.  did my piddly yoga today. lol.  yesterday i had granola which brought all my rda averages well over 100%....for the week.  weird.   had to skimp on much else for the rest of the day  due to all the granola calories. i'm not complaining.  right at 1000 calories. 29% protein, 21% fat and 50% carbs.

      there's a sense of no space or time when working with roses. no thoughts of food or water, hot or cold. probably what artists, athletes and musicians  feel. that zone thing.    grilled shrimp is sounding good today. if i make it out to t. joes again today i'll pick some up.  yesterday i was back to the usual: salad with chicken and a big eggwhite souffle. i hope its right to rename what was the eggwhite omlette, now that i'm whipping it up first.    went out at 7 this morning for earlybird garage sale hopping on the bike.  everyone had coffee. smelled really good. i had my tea which i love.  earl gray with 1/2 & 1/2 and stevia. a whole quart.

      guess all i needed was the fantasy.  never got the frozen yogurt but good to know it will still be cr when i'm ready.    instead i had a big salad with chicken and apples for lunch.  for dinner i whipped up the eggwhites into the biggest fluffiest souffle ever.  spooned salsa atop and it was better than any restaurant.  gonna do that again today for lunch. shopping this morning for spinich and mushrooms to stuff it with.  julia child, famous for french cooking, just died today at 92.   i can still hear her saying "you can do it."  92 is a pretty long life. saw her not long ago and she still seemed intact. still cooking. doubt she croned though.  we should have a cron show on the food channel.

      caved in and bought a women's one a day. i can  smell that thing all the way in the bedroom.  a new "experiment."  my rda's are typically low, and im sure always were. even so, at 48 i'm going quite well.  will i go even better with higher rda's?  we'll see after a month.  certainly don't want a longer life in a broken down container.   to balance out that yucky B vitamin taste, lunch will be a very large soft serve, sugar free (not nutrasweet), FROZEN YOGURT thing....with added almonds.    i figure it's pretty harmless and high enjoyment factor. totaling 342 calories of 8 fat grams,  72 carb grams and   12 protein.  the shop has three flavors.    if anyone knows any reason these two should not be together may they speak now.

      no, i didn't fall in love. but i am working in a beautiful rose garden now. everything's good.  today i really wasn't hungry til after four p.m.  had a 16 oz plain yogurt from trader joes and 2 apples right off the tree.  needless to say my plan to advance my meal schedule  at this point has backfired. lunch at 4.  dinner at 8. still getting at least a 17 hour digestion break.  tonight for dinner i had 5 oz grilled chicken over my green salad. a little apple for desert. protein is a good thing. 51 grams today.  i feel good. and tired.....in a good way.  peace.

      today i did not do the all fruit thing OR the high protein thing.  but something totally different..... and scary.  had a bag of granola for lunch. not a binge, but enough calories to fill in for my tiny breakfast.  under a pound but over 8 oz.   needless to say i was content til dinnertime, which was a huge salad of romaine topped with salsa and grilled chicken strips.  total calories 1050 of 23% protein, 52% carb and 25% fat.  here's the crazy scary part.  all but 3 rda's passed 100% and many being closer to or exceeding 200%.  my usual cr diet of 1-2 cups fruit, 2# veggies and 8oz protein always leave almost all rda's in the red.  even on my very recent fruitarian days rda's were higher.    but i'd rather take a supplement than eat granola. i can't believe granola would be more ON than fresh veggies.  plus i had a jammin workout on the bike today, my heel feels alot more healed and i'm reading and writing without my glasses tonight.

      the fruit is gorgeous, sweet and cleansing......but requires much volume to remain satiated. after two days of the reminiscent sensual delight, last night i was a madwoman out for calories.  during the day i'd blissfully consumed a quarter watermelon, 2 cantaloupes, a nectarine, half pound european grapes, and maybe 5 apples......but by 7pm i  was restless and emotional. thoughts of ice cream were invading my mind. i finally jumped up and scrambled up a pan of eggwhites and ate them quite quickly even though they were drenched in hot salsa.  ahhhh.  i was beginning to come back to earth.  but not completely relaxed until after steaming a large artichoke.    eating so late last night caused me to sleep an hour later today, and of course this morning i feel even less appetite than usual. however i am sure my fling with the luscious fruit is over. for now.  a little surprised at my short tolerance for what i could get away with only months ago.  was hoping more youthing was occurring.

      i really adore willies and aprils beautiful logs. they are so alive, vibrant, funny and creative. my invisible friends.  praying mary has retired to a cr life in the woods and not fallen off some remote mountain.  in just one month i was inspired to slide about 30 + percentage points up the protein scale thus abandoning my longtime fruitarian fare, while still maintaining my cr goals.   alas yesterday i threw all caution to the wind for a sublime day of figs, grapes, blueberries, banana, mango, watermelon and apples from our trees. 1000 calories at 80/10/10.  it was like getting on a bike after months without.  easy as pie. refreshing, light and fun. and so far, with no crashing or residual cravings.  also, i did the same superpowered workout as any protein packed day. slept well and as far as i can tell, expressing my usual even temperament.  this is a very interesting "experiment" (as opposed to 12 Step "research," which is the cr equivalent to a full on party with the "dragon"). the rda differences seem to be mainly protein and mineral related. but even years of just fruit and greens my bloodwork has always been very good. i am very lucky.  i've heard many fruitheads have dreadful trouble down the line.  today i could go either way. i LOVE  both.....no idea which is best, but i enjoy the thought of less animals suffering.

      cool party. the first arriver brought hard boiled eggs and collards. the second tofu broccoli, and i had slow  broiled half a chicken, with romaine and the snappy drink  possibly the most nutritious party ever. i may have actually consumed over a hundred grams of pure protein today.    a few hours later went to the gym and power trained like this body has never seen before.  upon logout, the computer said i'd lifted over 35,000 lbs. dang.

      invited two food oriented friends over today for a protein potluck, as we all seem to be questing for the  "perfect protein."  i'm slow roasting half an organic chicken and plan to add a few sprays of olive oil, garlic cloves and rosemary  sprigs.  rosemary is the *love* herb.  also serving my favorite frozen purple berry medley over mineral water. a large bowl of chopped romaine on the side.  hope someone brings sushi. no carcenogenic beef, please.  we'll all go for a leisurely bike ride or walk at berkeley rose garden after.

      my lunch partner wanted to go out for soup. knew i'd be deeply disappointed eating stranger- made soup, so talked her into getting take out from w.foods, whilst i quickly dashed into t.joes for a yogurt and a bag of the purply berry medley.  such a treat and she equally loved her soup as we picnicked at the marina with a spectacular view of the bay, the clear sky, and golden gate bridge.    in that meal alone, i cashed in on 30 grams of protein. whereas if we'd gone to some old soup cafe, i surely would have left with about 8 or 9 grams protein and a massive high from  resorting to a nonfat latte.  dinner is gonna be a chicken leg with shiitake mushrooms atop my usual chopped pound of juicy crunchy romaine.  culminating to 64% carbs, 25% pro and 10% fat.

      woke up grieving recent fruitarian years.  momentarily considered an impromptu trip to the hot springs, which would be beneficial for the heel healing, til i realized it's smack mid fig time there and everyone else walks over them mindlessly. not this one!!! my mouth would quickly be one bubbly fig blister. not a fig would go to waste.  not too inspired today for my new cr plan. but truly speaking i know the benefits of less fruit are:  less cravings, better sleep, better dental health...... ummmmmmm ok lighter groceries. lol (really, i used to haul four 20-30 pound watermelons home every week).  oh yeah, probably better rda's, duh!!! and i'm sure  it's gotta be more family/friend/restaurant friendly.  maybe by lunch i'll realize some novel protein ambrosia treasure.

      being that my protein has risen from 10% of my total calories to 30-35%, my total calories have dropped a couple hundred..... without hunger or weight loss either afai can see. i'm not fond of the scaLe...but my jeans feel the same as before. wouldn't mind dropping 10 but i'm not going to stress it.  there's alot missing from my puzzle still as my rda's are mostly in the red, and im not fond of suppliments  either. i have good energy, feel free of cravings, and enjoy my meals, so i'm happy to learn as i go, without fret over the present deficits.  which must be greatly improved from a month ago when i was still an 8/1/1 raw vegan.....which i have nothing else negative to say about that plan, as that is where the name originated. ALL my food was ALL desert. melons, papaya, berries, figs.....on and on it went. very sweet. very sexy. now im lucky to get two apples a day.  but my head feels clear now. i can focus on more than what the papayas for lunch will taste like. easier to put a period at the end of each meal....the day and evening are not one continual snack.   i'm not resolved about eating animal products yet, but i gotta say i feel pretty good tonight after the eggwhites and chicken leg i consumed today.

      catching up on minerals and vitamins.    egg whites cooked with shiitake mushrooms onions,  parsley and celery. oh dang, just remembered i forgot  about the salsa. plenty tasty anyway.  apple for desert.  later (which is earlier now), huge romaine topped with  poppyseed dressing and believe it or not, organic chicken  giblets. nectarine for desert.    53% carb, 13% fat, 34%pro.  less food + more nutrients = definately less hunger.

      happy to be starting my fast a little earlier each day.  last nite i stopped eating at 7  by skipping the evening artichoke snack. tonight i'll have dinner right away, at 6ish since i had lunch at 1pm.  that will be it til noon tomorrow.  every day advancing lunch and dinner a little ahead, til they become breakfast and lunch.  fasting afternoon,  evening and nite, only taking tea with a little milk in the evening, like many buddhist monks do.  this week averaging around 900 calories: 165 carbs,  18 fat grams, and 65 gms protein.  seems a vast difference from my very recent raw vegan  80/10/10 days.  only in the past month am i experimenting  with cooked foods, dairy and more of a 50/20/30 ratio.  i remain committed to low cal, high nutrient, and daily half fasting, but remain unclear of exact content.   trusting it will resolve in time......while trying to just live.

      figs, dates, apples on top of yogurt....lunch doesn't get much more delightful. along with a dinner of slow cooked black beans and celery on top of a salad of romaine and raspberry vineragette.  and a huge artichoke for evening snack.  yesterday was   908 kcal.  3 fat. 190 carb. 41 pro.  i am of the breakfast camp.....one teabag of english breakfast in a quart of steaming water, 4 oz fat free half n half and a shake of pure stevia. that yummy "breakfast'" keeps me happy til lunch  at 2pm.  besides being a morning clean out instigator. same said  for last nights artichoke.  dinner is at 7pm and if i can cut the night snack, i'd get an 18 hour daily digestion rest.  a half day fast. that's my quest this week.    it'd be nice to exchange a few carbs for protein and good fats,  but that will be a forthcoming project.

      i wish beans had more protein.  everyday i soak a third of a cup of some legume or another.  usually pink or black beans.  then slowcook in the crockpot.  makes about four and a half ounces cooked for:  150 calories, 1 fat gram,  27 carbs, and only 11 grams of protein.  if i bend my ethics for a cup of eggwhites; a higher quantity than the beans yields more than twice as much protein, for less calories.  1C eggwhites (before cooking): 121 cals, 0 fat,  2 carbs and 25 protein  two cups plain yogurt give 28 on the protein at  240 calories. but i've visited alot of dairy cows. not good. had some twice last week. felt good in the body, but not in the heart.  pre cron daze i'd waste 450 calories on a bag of granola for about  9 grams protein and 70 carbs.  perhaps for today the beans are a healthy middle path balance.   um........think i'll go to the kite festival down at the marina!!!
