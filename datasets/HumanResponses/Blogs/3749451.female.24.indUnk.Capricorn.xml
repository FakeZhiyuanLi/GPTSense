       Before a great vision becomes reality, there may be difficulty. Before a person begins a great endeavor, they may encounter chaos. As a new plant breaks the ground with great difficulty, fore shadowing the large tree, so must we sometimes push against difficulty in bringing forth our dreams. "Out of Chaos, Brilliant stars are born."

      I've never written a love song  That didn't end in tears Maybe you'll rewrite my love song If you can replace my fears I need your patience and guidance And all your lovin' and more When thunder rolls through my life Will you be able to weather the storm? There's so much I would give ya, baby If I'd only let myself There's this well of emotions I feel I must protect But what's the point of this armor If it keeps the love away, too? I'd rather bleed with cuts of love Than live without any scars Baby, can I trust this? Or do all things end? I need to hear that you'd die for me Again and again and again So tell me when you look in my eyes Can you share all the pain and happy times 'Cause I will love you for the rest of my life This is my very first love song That didn't end in tears I think you re-wrote my love song For the rest of my years I will love you for the rest of my life

       Ok it's inventory time at work.. Thing is in the past we've only had two or three people stay during inventory... This year however we have 11 freakin people working... Insanity. Not to mention the fact that at 3pm there will 6 of us... Doing nothing really...And getting paid. I suppose that is the only good thing about it. I get paid to do nothing... I wonder if I can make that my life's work.... Nothing.

       i think that people that have been deemed insane have only gone insane because one day, long ago,  they were just so damn bored.. it just happened.. they went nuts....i think i'm almost at that point right now.

       I had read this piece years ago and thought it was amazing, and thought of how it reminded me of myself. Well, I finally found it again for all to read...so here it is.      Meantime Girl  She's the one you call when you're bored because she makes you laugh. She's the one you talk to when you're feeling down because she's willing to lend an ear and be a friend. She's not the one you call when you need a date to your company's Christmas party, or to go dancing with on a Saturday night. She's the one you spend time with between girlfriends, before you find "The One". You know, the one who you keep around in the meantime.  She's not one of the guys, not a tomboy, but you don't look at her as a "real" woman, either. She's not bitchy enough, moody enough, or sexy enough to be seen in that light. She's too laid-back, too easily amused by the same things your male buddies are amused by. She's too understanding, too comfortable. She doesn't make you feel nervous or excited the way a "real" woman does. But she's cool, and nice, and funny, and attractive enough that when you're lonely or horny and need intimate female companionship, she'll do just fine. You don't have to wine and dine her because she knows the real you already, and you don't have any facades to keep up, no pretenses to preserve. You're not trying to get anything of substance out of her. She's not easy, but you know that she cares about you and is attracted to you, and that she'll give you the intimacy you need. And you know you don't have to explain yourself or the situation, that she'll be able to cope with the fact that this isn't the beginning of a relationship or that there's any possibility that you have any real romantic feelings for her. It won't bother her that you'll get up in the morning, put on your pants, say goodbye, and go on a date with the woman you've been mooning over for weeks who finally agreed to go out with you. She'll settle for a goodbye hug and a promise to call her and tell her how the date went. She's just so cool . . . why can't all women be like that?! But deep down, if you really think about it (which you probably don't because to you, the situation between the two of you isn't important enough to merit any real thought), you know that it's really not fair. You know that although she would never say it, it hurts her to know that despite all her good points and all the fun you two have, you don't think she's good enough to spend any real time with. Sure, it's mostly her fault, because she doesn't have to give in to your needs. She could play the hard-to-get bitch like the rest of them do, if she really wanted to. But you and she both know that she probably couldn't pull it off. Maybe she's too short, or a little overweight, or has a big birthmark on her forehead, or works at Taco Bell. Whatever the reason, somehow life has given her a lot of really great qualities but has left out the ones that men want (or think they want) in a woman. So she remains forever the funny friend, the steadfast companion, the secret lover, and you go on searching for your goddess who will somehow be everything you ever wanted in a woman.  You'll joke to her that she should be the best man at your wedding, and she'll laugh and make a joke about a smelly rental tux. She doesn't captivate you with her beauty, or open doors with her smile. Mainly she blends in with the crowd. She's safe. She doesn't want to be the center of attention and turn the heads of everyone in the room. But she wants to turn someone's head. She wants to be special to someone, too. We all do.  She has feelings. She has a heart. In fact, she probably has a bigger and better heart than any woman you've ever known because she's had a front-row seat to The Mess That Is Your Life, and she likes you anyway. She obviously sees something worthwhile and redeeming in you because although you've given her nothing, absolutely no reason to still be around, she is.  Anyway, yeah. I'm a Meantime Girl. Been one more times than I care to admit. I don't know the reason, really, and at this point I don't even care. I just want to let every guy know who's ever had the good fortune to have a Meantime Girl that we may be a lot of fun, but we cry, too. A lot. And someday we won't be around.      Special thanks to   urlLink  vigilant    of deardiary.net for writing this great piece. I know how she feels.
