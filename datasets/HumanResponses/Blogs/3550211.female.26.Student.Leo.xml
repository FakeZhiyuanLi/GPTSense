      on CNN this morning, they said reagan's health was rapidly declining and they expected him to pass away within the next few months. well, evidently, that wasn't such a hot diagnosis.   it's sad that he passed away, but i'm not surprised. the poor man was suffering horribly from Alzheimer’s disease, not to mention he was 93 yrs old. we should all be so lucky.   i don't agree with everything that reagan did, however, i certainly can't deny the fact that he was good man. in fact, up until  urlLink the Iran-contra affair,  Mr. Reagan enjoyed tremendous popularity.    here's a nice quote: "He saw that what was strangling America was the suffocation of big government and high taxation; he paid respect to religion but never turned Republicanism into what it is today - a repository for sectarian scolding; he saw that the use of military force was sometimes necessary to defeat tyranny; and that the greatest weapon against the creeping march of cynicism was self-confidence and optimism." - urlLink andrew sullivan   plus, the man was just funny. it's always a riot to hear presidents or presidental candidates bust out with hip one-liners to bring in the youthful crowd. it's so lame .. and yet i can't help but laugh.  read more in the  urlLink new york times     urlLink Blogroll Me!

      unfortunately, my blog about  urlLink conservativepunk.com  was mistakenly deleted. what a shame to, because i went into depth on my whole theory concerning punks, and the conservative point of view. even though i am a member of the more liberal punk organization  urlLink punkvoter.com , i find that i tend to agree with a lot of the same issues as conservativePunk.com founder nick rizzuto. i don't have the time or energy to get into it again, but basically he points out that there is a whole generation of people that do not fit into any certain liberal or conservative mold. like me, he thinks that we need to try and get away from such rigid standards and labels and instead work together.   a great quote from rizzuto: "When people realize there's common ground between liberals and conservatives, it could help to mend a bit of the extreme hatred one side has for the other."  my respect and admiration for this guy is constantly growing. i love what he says about punkvoter, his so-called "enemy" - "Aren't punks allowed to sit down and logically think out what political side they want to take on certain issues?," Rizzuto said. "Obviously, Punkvoter is not about tearing down; it's about working with the system to change."  i applaud him.  read what i am talking about  urlLink here.    urlLink Blogroll Me!

      rumsfeld. what a jackass.  i took this from  urlLink andrew sullivan's  blog.    "The only way we ever found [Saddam] is finally somebody put enough pressure on enough people to find out that somebody had an idea where somebody might know somebody who might know somebody who would know where he might have been," -  urlLink Donald Rumsfeld , in classic form.

      watching Reagan's final services last night on the telly was an emotional experience. after the fly over i was pretty close to tears. however, it was when they handed Mrs. Reagan the flag, i started to cry. that is such a symbolic moment. my grandmother was a nurse in the air force, and at her funeral last year they gave my dad the flag. it is a very very touching moment.   although i was glued to the tv set, i thought it was pretty invasive to be showing such a personal thing on tv. i doubt the Reagan family wanted their grief to be shown to the entire nation. i understand he was once a president, but still, the sound of all those photographers was rude and disturbing. and yet, like dogs, so many of us sat there begging for more. i'm disgusted with myself. i wanted to turn the channel, but i just couldn't.  i thought the best quote came from Ron jr. he said, "Dad was also a deeply, unabashedly religious man. But he never made the fatal mistake of so many politicians wearing his faith on his sleeve to gain political advantage. True, after he was shot and nearly killed early in his presidency, he came to believe that God had spared him in order that he might do good. But he accepted that as a responsibility, not a mandate. And there is a profound difference."  i don't know about you, but i think that was a personal attack toward the head of our current government.   heh. good.

      You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down. Up to man's age-old dream -- the maximum of individual freedom consistent with order -- or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism. Regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would sacrifice freedom for security have embarked on this downward path. Plutarch warned, "The real destroyer of the liberties of the people is he who spreads among them bounties, donations and benefits." -Ronald Reagan -October 27, 1964  Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free. - Ronald Reagan  It is not my intention to do away with government. It is rather to make it work -- work with us, not over us; stand by our side, not ride on our back. Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it. -Ronald Reagan -First Inaugural Address, January 20, 1981   Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall! - Ronald Reagan -Speech near the Berlin Wall, 1987

      it's one thing to destroy a ricky martin song, and mangle "take me out to the ballgame," but it is an entirely different thing to muddle up "we are the champions" by queen.   william hung, the american idol reject, plans on doing just that on next album. GIVE ME A BREAK ALREADY. at first, i didn't know if hung's first album was a colossal joke. i mean we all laugh when we hear him sing "she bang's" but to give the guy a record deal? why? who would buy his cd? evidently, almost 100,000 people have. that astounds me. i can appreciate this being his 15 minutes of fame and all, but how is this ridiculous scene still playing? i think this joke has been over played. it's not funny anymore. it's just not. to everybody who bought his cd and who plans on buying his next one - GET A LIFE! waste your money on some decent music.  read the  urlLink article  for yourself.

      It took awhile, but I'm finally not afraid to come right out and say: yes, a part of me is conservative. For a long time I lived in denial, not wanting to accept that a person, such as myself, could, in fact, agree with conservatives on more then one issue. Over time however, I came to realize that I wasn't nearly as liberal as I originally thought.   I'm not a bleeding-heart liberal. When it comes to money, I'm pretty much a free-market conservative.  The republican party headed by Reagan, is a party that I have a lot more similarities with then the Bush administration. I'm not saying I agree with everything Reagan did or stood for, because I don't. However, I'm simply tryting to point out that, I am, at times conservative.   Reagan's republicanism was one of much more optimism then today's. It was more expansive, and focused less on government. As  urlLink andrew sullivan  said, "He would never have presided over the massive increases in domestic spending that Bush has; he would not have signed onto a new entitlement for Medicare, a program he first opposed in its entirety; he would not have played the anti-gay card that Karl Rove has; and he would never have recast his party into one where only fundamentalist Christians are ultimately, fully at home."  The religion issue, is perhaps one of the biggest differences between our current president and Reagan. Reagan's position is obviously much more liberal. I mean, he was a divorced man who hardly went to church, and on top of that he campaigned against homophobia and brought AIDS awareness to the public's attention. In addition, according to sullivan, "there was always the old Democrat in Reagan's new Republican, a deep sense of civility, a wry sense of humor, a faith leavened with skepticism, a conservatism informed by liberalism's faith in the future."   I'll end this little spiel with a quote: "I hope that when you're my age you'll be able to say, as I have been able to say: we lived in freedom, we lived lives that were a statement, not an apology" -Ronald Reagan (1911-2004)  hmmm. i wonder if we will.

      how can i put this delicately ... the jews think madonna is a slut and they don't want her representing the kabbalah center. ha-ha. i guess that didn't come out to delicately after all. oh those silly rabbi's.   "Rabbi Shmuley Boteach has attacked Madonna, calling her a "slut" and a "vulgarian." In a startling essay for SomethingJewish.Co.UK, the Rabbi blasts Phillip Berg, the head of the Kabbalah Centre for letting the Material Girl be the religions highest-profile spokesperson."  granted, having madonna as the kabbalah spokeswomen is not exactly what i would call, an intelligant move, but hey - it's certainly not an abomination either. as a madonna fan, i take everything she says and does with a grain of salt, and as a jew, i understand where rabbi shmuley is coming from. afterall, he is orthodox and madonna, well, she certainly is not. hell - she's not even jewish. and there is problem #1. heh.   read what i am talking about  urlLink here.

       can't believe that it has been 4 years since you passed away. You were only 18, and I, I wasn't even 21 years old yet. Seems like a life time ago. I think it probably was. You know, I never told you this, but I had such a crush on you. I thought you were so cute, and so much fun. But the fact that you were one of my best friends little brothers, well, I just didn't see it right to tell you how I felt. The three of us had some pretty good times together though. I remember one of the last times I saw you. Your parents were gone, and you and your sister threw a party. It was pretty wild, and you got pretty drunk. In fact, you passed out in the upstairs bathroom. I saw you in there and wet a washcloth and washed you up with it. I wonder if you ever knew I did that. You always had such a sweet angelic face. Your death has always seemed so wrong to me. It just isn't fair. With so many horrible people in this world, why would it be "your" time to go? You, who was so vibrant, so full of life. I know it was a foolish accident, a mistake on your part. But, for me, that is no justification. It's not a good enough reason for me to accept why you, of all people, died.  One of the last times I talked to your sister, she told me that she saw you. That she had spoken to you. The depth of her despair worried me so much. I told her you were probably watching over her. That you, in death, had become her guardian angel. I'd like to think that you still are. Well, my dear, perhaps one day we will meet again. But until then, you will live on forever in the hearts of those who had the honor and privilege to know you.  May you rest in peace. Love forever, Jennifer.

      This is a propaganda war and it seriously gets me mad that in our own country we are focusing on OUR mistakes. For example, on the news all we hear about is the prison scandal. Don't get me wrong, I think it is horrible what we did. I don't excuse it or agree with it. However, when Berg was executed the media only focused on that for like, 10 seconds and then it was right back to the prison scandal. I think we need to show the enemy's atrocities just as much as we show ours.   It is absolutely horrible what happened to Paul Johnson today. My heart goes out to his family. However, it is times like this, that it is more important then ever to show the true horribleness of our enemy. Will big media show the images? I think they absolutely should.  I also think that these terrorist need to be taken out of the equation. They are horrible, horrible people who will do anything to anyone to ensure their survival, and their power. Their unbridled hatred for us scares me to death. They have to be defeated.

      I'm finding what the  urlLink right  has to say about Moore's movie to be very interesting. I don't agree with all of it, but I do agree with some points that are being made.   I get the impression that the pro-Bush folks are feeling a little bitter about not having anything to compete with F-9/11. Michael Moore is a liberal activist. He has strongly stated his position and quite frankly he made this movie to persuade people not to vote for Bush.   It's propaganda. And unfortunately, if this movie is anything like his last one, there will be many inaccuracies. THAT is what gets me mad. The fact that it's bullshit propaganda. If it is full of lies, like I suspect it will be, then in my eyes, Moore is just as bad as Bush.   Why is being truthful so damn difficult?

      I came across this article as I was googling a search for Jewish punk bands. I'm trying to find punk in Hebrew. Anyway, this is an interesting  urlLink article  about a new Jewish magazine.   I quote: "Self-satire has a long tradition in Jewish culture," said founder Jennifer Bleyer, 26. "Our magazine takes that tradition and applies it to the interests and media habits of an underserved audience of young Jews."

      Here is an interesting article in the  urlLink NY Times  that points out some disturbing robot-like behavior seen in the both the president and vice-president.   On Monday, at the White House unveiling ceremony for the Clintons' official portraits, Bush evidently acted totally out of character: "witty, engaged, amiable, bipartisan and magnanimous.   Mr. Clinton told friends afterward that he was blown away, that W. had never been so nice to him before. There was no smirk, no begrudging.   The article goes on to state that perhaps our presidential leaders have been rewired like the stepford wives.   Unfortunately, Cheney did not come out of the "operation" as well as Bush did.  Mr. Cheney isn't programmed to process evidence that shows he was wrong; he simply keeps repeating the same nonsensical claims as if he has a microchip malfunction. ... Cheney-bot just keeps going and going: "He had long-established ties with Al Qaeda. . . . He had long-established ties with Al Qaeda-a-a. . . . He-he-e-e—— brzzzrrrp!"

      In April, when I was in New York, like total dorks, my friends and I hung out outside the Today Show with our signs hoping to meet Katie and Matt and get on TV. It was freezing cold, there were no celebrity guests and Matt wasn't even there. We didn't stay very long.  I only bring this up because Vince Vaughn is currently being interviewed by Matt Lauer on the Today Show. PLUS, he was outside signing autographs for the dorks holding their signs hoping to get on TV.  So, I'm a little jealous. So what. I'll recover .. even though I love Vince Vaughn. Nothing beats "Swingers." "Old School" was awesome as well. And now, I have to admit, I am looking forward to seeing "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story."   During Vaughn's interview they suggested that almost everybody remembers dodgeball from their elementary school days, and from those memories there are only two ways people feel about dodgeball: you love it or hate it. You were either the kid hiding in the corner because you got hit in the face, or you were the kid who threw the ball a 100 mph into some kids face.   I was the kid hiding in the corner because the boys always threw the ball super hard and it HURT!

      And I am already getting annoyed by it. I really have no patience for big media anymore. On the local news and national news, I just keep hearing the same bullshit. "it's biased, politically driven .." blah blah blah. NO SHIT. It's Michael fucking Moore. And he is a very biased man.   I am looking forward to seeing this movie. However, I can tell you right now, that the movie is going to frustrate me more then I would like it to. I only say this because, Michael Moore, is well, a little to extreme for my liking. Oh, alright, I'll just come out and say it, I thing the guy can be a schmuck.  It's hysterical, nevermind ironic, that his movie which is currently being debated and discussed on every news channel, played right into one of Moore's favorite motifs. Disney's refusal to distribute "Fahrenheit 9/11" just proves his theory about the suffocating power of big media.   It would seem that attempted suppression is a promotional must these days. Just look at what happened with Mel Gibson and his "Passion of the Christ," or O'Reilly's lawsuit putting Franken on the bestseller list. To quote the Washington post, "Now we have the Moore/Disney psychodrama. We have gone from the marketing Calvary of Christ to Michael Moore's Messiah complex."  Although, I don't know how much promotion this movie really needs. The public has a growing dissent for president Bush and his fellow conservatives. In fact, "Bush-loathing" has reached new heights. People are looking for anything to grab onto that will cater to their frustration with the current government. Democrats and others who find themselves more towards the left on the political spectrum have found in Moore's movie a passion of emotions that no Democratic nominee could possibly arouse.  According to a  urlLink Washington post  review:   Nobody raised a question about his film's wacky insinuations that Bush let Taliban thugs escape because of some previously concocted deal in Texas or let Osama bin Laden get away because of deep Bush connections to the bin Laden family. In Moore's version of Iraq nobody was hanging from a meat hook in Saddam Hussein's jails. Baghdad was a happy city where children frolicked in the streets until boom! we blew them away. The invasion of Afghanistan? That was just a cover for running an oil pipeline across the country.    "Conspiracy theory" might not be the right phrase, but it's the first phrase that comes to mind.   And the Democrates and the liberals are eating it up. I guess the usual arguments against Moore -- "that he's intellectually dishonest, that he's a master of the cheap shot, that he's a loudmouthed neo-Marxist boor" -- can be easily pushed aside when what he says, makes your enemy look like the devil himself.  Not to mention, after the weapons of mass destruction fallacy and the Saddam-9/11 fictions, a lot of liberals feel that it's payback time. If Bush can lie, then we will too.  I think the truth for any political party and/or political statement is never even considered. Everything has to be exaggerated and embellished. A lie covers a lie covers a lie .. Well, you get the point.   I'll have more to say after I actually see the movie of course. I did leave a link to the trailer in a past blog.    9:04am    UPDATE:   at  urlLink instapundit.com  Glenn Reynolds reports on how Moore's film is getting a favorable reaction abroad.

      According to what  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  says in his blog today, it looks like Senator Rick Santorum will try and get a vote on the Federal Marriage Amendment in the Senate just before the Democratic Convention.   That's not surprising, after all the Defense of Marriage Act was also introduced in the summer before a presidential election in 1996. It's all about strategy. A way to gather up social conservative votes and energy before elections.   But can they get the necessary 67 votes? Lets hope not.  However, in my opinion, this changes not only the entire perspective, but the topic as well. Santorum and friends are no longer really focusing on gay marriage but rather changing the constitution.   I am not for such an amendment. I have no problem with same-sex marriage. I think it is only fair that gay people receive the same legal benefits that straight people do. This is a topic that for some reason fascinates me. I've done numerous papers on this topic for school, so excuse me as I rant for a second.   What scares me about this amendment is how anti-American it is. In more then two hundred years of American history, the United States Constitution has been amended only 17 times since the Bill of Rights, and in each instance (except for Alcohol Prohibition, which was repealed), it was to extend rights and liberties to the American people, not restrict them. For example, the Constitution was amended to end slavery, and later to guarantee women the right to vote. However, this new proposal is based on discrimination because it would ensure that same-sex couples are denied the equal protections that marriage brings to American families. For the first time, everybodys rights are being violated because never before has an amendment granted the courts the right to make vast, sweeping changes in the law to reform society.  The mere suggestion that the government has the right to dictate such a social innovation should outrage all Americans on the basic principle that this country's government is founded on a liberal ideology.    Marriage is a basic human right and an individual personal choice. "The right of the individual to marry within his sex is covered by the same right of privacy that protects the individual's right to marry outside his race, to take birth control, or to procure an abortion. It goes to the heart of our right to make fundamental decisions regarding our individual lives ... Accordingly, it is a paradigmatic freedom that ought to be, and hence is, protected by the Fourteenth Amendment" (West).   The fact of the matter is, gays are asking Americans to recognize their relationships as kinship bonds, and there is no good reason why they shouldn't be so recognized. I believe with all my heart in freedom of religion, separation of church and state, and equality of opportunity for all humans. It is preposterous to me that people oppose gay marriage because it threatens, mocks, or does something to the "sanctity" of marriage. Yeah, like any marriage in Las Vegas can be considered sacred.   The truth is, marriage exists because society finds it to be a valuable institution. It is a relationship based on love; so therefore, it can not possibly be limited to only heterosexuals.   Unfortunately, those who oppose gay marriage do so with vehemence. It's not simply that they see it as an abomination, but rather that they regard it as perhaps the greatest moral and social evil to occur since the legalization of abortion.   Well, I don't mind telling you that sometimes most Americans are just wrong.

      The 'Drug Provision' of the Higher Education Act strips all federal education assistance from any student with any drug related conviction. So far, it has kept 153,000 students from building a better life while producing no measurable reduction in drug use at all. It targets the poor, discriminates against minorities, usurps the role of the courts and damages society.

      Afghan President Hamid Karzai joked about not wanting to leave the United States during his visit with president Bush on Tuesday.   "It's been nice visiting the United States again. One likes to stay here and not go, it's such a good country," Karzai said in the White House Rose Garden.  Can you blame the guy? In his own country he faces the constant threat of assassination.  Unfortunately, Bush wasn't down with Karzai's idea, "jokingly telling the Afghan leader, 'Get home and get to work, will you?'"  Nice, eh.

      A lot of people ask me where I stand on the political spectrum. Here is a short answer:  I'm an economic conservative and more of a social liberal. But that's not my lifestyle - it's a philosophy. Punk rock is about having no rules. By saying that you can't have conservative political beliefs (or any politicial belief for that matter)and be a punk is like saying you have to think a certain way in order to BE a punk. And that is bullshit.  However, just because I lean towards the right on some issues, does not by any means suggest that I am a Bush supporter. I am not.   George W. claims that god talks to him and commands him. Not only does that sound completely dumb to me, but it also horrifies me. I don't care who you are, every person who has claimed that god speaks to them, turns out to be INSANE. For some reason god always wants people to kill in his name. the Iraq war is a great example of Bush doing just that. Having the religious right in charge of people's lives scares me to the very bone.  Bush is going to appoint two new supreme court justices who will remain there for life, and they are going to try to overturn Roe Vs Wade, the draft and so on and so forth.  Unfortunately, this is not the election to vote for personal desires. I am a registered independent, but I can't vote for Nader. Not that I want to vote for Kerry either. The pickings suck. At this point, I just feel that Bush needs to be removed from office so damage control can begin.  There are a lot of people who think that when you speak out against George Bush that you're not a patriot. But the thing is, I love this country, and that is why I feel the need to say something about what is going on. I love America, and I'm so glad I live here … it's just a shame that the rest of the world thinks of us a hillbillies.  I know this was very generalized, and I have a lot more to say on a lot of topics, but unfortunately, I have limited time. So, therefore, I will get to it a little later

      George W. Bush has a habit of mangling his words.    urlLink Slate.msn.com  has compiled many of the president's accidental phrases, which they coined as  "Bushisms"    Here is an example: "I think if you know what you believe, it makes it a lot easier to answer questions. I can't answer your question."-In response to a question about whether he wished he could take back any of his answers in the first debate. Reynoldsburg, Ohio, Oct. 4, 2000  Just one reason out of a million why I find listening to the president's speeches so amusing. scary .. but amusing.   Slate editor Jacob Weisberg has compiled many "Bushisms," many of which are very funny and noteworthy. However, according to  urlLink spinsanity.org  the "Bushisms" series "has also frequently taken the President's words out of context to make reasonable statements seem nonsensical, grammatically incorrect or even offensive."  You be the judge.

Evidently the cable people have been hard at work. I'm sure that there was some significant and deathly important reason for this, but for the life of me I can't figure out what it is. In fact, I don't even care. All I know is that I now have to sit down and figure out where my favorite channels are hiding.

      A majority of Americans support President Bush. That support is faith-based, not fact-based. If you believe that there is a supreme being in the heavens who created the universe and is keeping tabs on all of our deeds, I guess belief in Bush is not so far-fetched. For those of us with our feet and minds planted in reality, having faith in Bush is just plain dumb. -  urlLink Paul Corrigan

      If there is ONE thing that I just can't seem to get over, it is the "front" of having a prude attitude that most Americans try to pass off. The hypocrisy of "sex" in this country seems to know, no bounds. America, wants to be known around the world, as the country devoted to its ethical morality. And ethical morality, according to the Christian Fundamentalist who rule our great nation, is of course, attached to our sex organs. Once again, we easily brush aside the fact that our devoted leader has lied consistently through out his term, but oh no no no - he has NEVER cheated on his wife like Clinton. Who, by the way, is still being condemned. So, I guess, by American standards, Bush has not broken a single ethical rule.   Good for HIM.  Unfortunately, it would appear that nobody informed Republican Senate candidate Jack Ryan of these rules. The kinky bastard, has to pull out of the race (ha! no pun intended).   The scandal ...  urlLink sex club allegations.  Yep. You read right. Sex club allegations.    I have to agree with  urlLink vice squad  when they say,  this is quite possibly the lamest sex scandal in the history of sex scandals.  Allegedly, the guy took his wife to a few racy clubs back when they were married.   I guess he should have worked within the hypocrisy, and rented porn. Porn on TV ok. Live nude girls not.  Shame on HIM.

      Oops! It would appear that our VP had a slight slip of the tongue when he blurted out the  urlLink "F word"  at Democratic Sen. Leahy.    The incident occurred on Tuesday in a terse discussion between the two that touched on politics, religion and money, with Cheney finally telling Leahy to "f--- off" or "go f--- yourself," the aides said.  During their exchange, Leahy noted that Republicans had accused Democrats of being anti-Catholic because they are opposed to some of President Bush's anti-abortion judges, the aides said.   That's when Cheney unloaded with the "F-bomb," aides said.   Well, he certainly showed those "anti-Catholics," now didn't he. I bet they'll never think to oppose him again. After all, the next thing to come after a good telling off, is an ass kicking.   Now, THAT, I would like to see.

      I am still eagerly awaiting my opportunity to see Moore's F-9/11.   Will the film be everything they promise it to be over at  urlLink punkvoter ?   This film does an excellent job of exposing the failed leadership of Bush Jr. and it's a great opportunity for you to take a friend or family member to an event that may open their eyes or change their opinion regarding our embarrassing President.   Or could it possibly be as horrific and completely full of shit, like  urlLink Hitch  says it is?   [It's]a film that bases itself on a big lie and a big misrepresentation [that] can only sustain itself by a dizzying succession of smaller falsehoods, beefed up by wilder and (if possible) yet more-contradictory claims.   My guess is that it will land somewhere in the middle.  If anyone has seen it, I would love to hear what you have to say.

      First it is Rex Reed, today it is Al Gore. Which leads to the inevitable question: Has he gone completely mad?   Here's what  urlLink lileks  has to say about it:    He coined a new term for the Internet critics of his positions: digital brownshirts. Yes, yes, it’s over the top. But it’s not the sentiment that raises eyebrows, it’s the position of the person who’s saying it. We don’t expect presidential candidates past or present to indulge in Usenet flame-war lingo. We don’t expect serious party elders to call the other side Nazis, and for good reason:  it’s obscene . The brownshirts were evil. The brownshirts kicked the Jews in the streets and made the little kids put their hands on their heads as they stumbled off to the trains. The brownshirts were not interested in refuting arguments. They were interested in killing the people who dared argue at all.   I absolutely HATE comparisons to Hitler. It's not only over-played, but there is never any fact to back it up. These politicians have to stop resorting to "name calling" in their never-ending battle of seeing who has bigger balls.

      That is the question asked over at The Volokh Conspiracy:  urlLink Why do some people think that it's more polite to say "Jewish people" than "Jews"?

I think it's ridiculous. I call myself a "Jew" quite frequently. A cheap Jew, at that. Not to mention, a Jew who lives up to the fabulous (and hysterical) stereotype; my New York grandparents moved to Florida years ago!   LoL.

      So, Clinton lied under oath. So what? He  urlLink LIED  about cheating on his wife. Not that I condone what he did by any means, nor do I excuse it. However, it still amazes me that THIS is what SO many people are talking about.   "In his August 1998 grand jury testimony, Clinton said he began an inappropriate sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky in "early 1996." His testimony, as was widely noted at the time, was in conflict with Lewinsky's story: She testified the relationship began on Nov. 15, 1995, in the midst of a government shutdown.  Starr's prosecutors, in their report to Congress, accused Clinton of lying about the date of their relationship in order to avoid admitting that he had sexual relations with an intern … Without explanation, in his memoir Clinton departs from his grand jury testimony and corroborates her version: "During the government shutdown in late 1995, when very few people were allowed to come to work in the White House, and those who were there were working late, I'd had an inappropriate encounter with Monica Lewinsky…"  Ummm .. Excuse me. But I think what president Bush has been LYING about is MUCH more important. You know, like that little lie about the weapons of mass destruction, just for starters.   Priorities people. Priorities.

      "I am not new to my conservative principles. No one has ever tried to accuse me of being a liberal Republican or a moderate Republican; I have only been a conservative Republican. And, as a conservative Republican, I have never compromised my basic principles - limited government, the free market, steadfast adherence to civil liberties including the right to keep and bear arms and the rights of the states - in the search for higher office. I appear before you today in that spirit of consistency with conservative ideals... I, along with many other conservative opinion leaders and lawmakers, strongly oppose the Federal Marriage Amendment for three main reasons. First, by moving what has traditionally been a state prerogative - local marriage laws -- to the federal government, it is in direct violation of the principles of federalism. Second, in treating the Constitution as an appropriate place to impose publicly contested social policies, it would cheapen the sacrosanct nature of that document, opening the door to future meddling by liberals and conservatives. Third, it is unnecessary so long as DOMA is in force." - former congressman Bob Barr, testifying on the Hill yesterday against the Federal Marriage Amendment.

      Here is another fascinating article about Moore's "Fairenheit 9/11." Slate writer,  urlLink Hitchens  makes some very good arguments, or I suppose you could even say accusations, that depict Moore's movie as nothing more then lies.  "To describe this film as dishonest and demagogic would almost be to promote those terms to the level of respectability. To describe this film as a piece of crap would be to run the risk of a discourse that would never again rise above the excremental. To describe it as an exercise in facile crowd-pleasing would be too obvious. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a sinister exercise in moral frivolity, crudely disguised as an exercise in seriousness. It is also a spectacle of abject political cowardice masking itself as a demonstration of "dissenting" bravery."  This guy has a valid argument for every single Moore "fabrication." It's a very interesting article.

      It's the kids who do  urlLink wicked wicked things like this  that grow up to be serial killers.    Six puppies were killed, apparently by fireworks placed in their mouths, shortly after teenage boys were seen carrying Roman candles in a north Tulsa neighborhood.   An older dog, a 41/2-month-old black Labrador mix, suffered burns on her muzzle and hindquarters from apparently being used as a moving target for fireworks.   The Tulsa Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was caring for the injured dog and for the puppies’ mother, a 11/2-year-old black-and-tan heeler mix that was not harmed.   The injured dog had begun to eat and was expected to survive, said Laurie Myers, executive director of the Tulsa SPCA.   The SPCA believes the puppies died from fireworks that exploded in their mouths.   That is absolutely preposterous behavior. I have half a sense to call the PETA gang on their asses. They'll teach those kids a lesson, because I doubt their parents will do anything more then send them to therapy. My ass would have literally been beat to a pulp, if I pulled a stunt like that. Not that I could EVER do such a thing.  But, it's not just kids who do such  urlLink horrible  things to animals.   Police say the 9-1-1 call from Portland’s Marshall Park neighborhood Sunday afternoon sounded beyond belief: A guy driving a green Subaru Outback, dragging two bloodied and panting dogs down the street.   turned out to be true, police say.   Shortly after 5:30 p.m., officers found Sean A. MacComb standing next to his car in a driveway in the 10700 block of Southwest 11th Drive. Two cablelike leashes and dog collars covered with "a copious amount of blood" were still attached to the back bumper, police say.   The two adult dogs, a black Labrador-Rottweiler mix and a brown mastiff-shepherd mix, are expected to survive their injuries. They were being held at the Multnomah County animal shelter in Troutdale.   Seriously, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE?

      I don't understand why the media chooses only to broadcast things that will embarrass Americans or America.   Once again, I share in this anger with  urlLink Andrew Sullivan .    Oh, they'll [the media] find out details of people's sex lives and sue to publish and broadcast them, and they'll show endless footage of Abu Ghraib abuses. But terrorist beheadings? Nah.   He goes on to quote from the Los Angeles Times: "Any news outlet — or any private individual, for that matter — who makes available footage of the actual beheadings is, to my mind, an accessory to the crime itself,"   Give me a break. This is war and THEY are the enemy. Why is American media just focusing on our mistakes?

       Paris Hilton is set to release her pop-rock album, "Screwed," on her record label, Heiress Records, at the end of the summer, and she'll be holding three bashes in New York, Los Angeles and Miami to celebrate the drop of her first single, sources said. While it's unclear which song will make it to the airwaves first, folks who have heard at least one produced track describe Hilton's sound as "old Blondie, not Britney Spears at all."   Those who know Hilton only from her Fox reality show and her dip into porn-video experimentation shouldn't count the glam girl out, said one source. People who have stumbled upon listening sessions already can't believe it's Hilton belting out a tune. "No way," said one shocked listener. "It sounds pretty good."   Paris Hilton has named her debut CD "Screwed?!" Freakin' brilliant. Have fun doing a Google search for info on that disc.  And how much you wanna bet that the "shocked listener" who said the CD sounded "pretty good" was also a co-star on "The Simple Life?" I'm thinking it's Tinkerbell, (since we all know Nicole Richie can't string a coherent sentence together).  I also heard that Heiress Records is accepting demos, but they're only taking 12 inches right now. (ba-doomp-boomp)

      I was at Target not that long ago, and while I was shopping I observed quite a number of people buying American flags. And I don't mean the small ones you hold, but the big huge ones that you put on your house. It surprised me to see so many people making this purchase. And then I wondered why it surprised me.   The truth of the matter is, but just thinking about celebrating the 4th of July, makes me feel a little embarrassed.   I HATE that I feel this way!    I can't help but wonder what the overall sentiments of this years 4th of July will be. To me, it is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, we are celebrating our country's independence, which essentially has no direct connection with the events that are currently taking place. On the other hand, our current events and the overall disgust that many Americans have toward our government, have to in some regard make you want to question, just what it is we are celebrating. That we're assholes and arrogant bastards? Well, we've always been that, but now there is true and "real" hatred towards us. And many of us think, rightly so.   I'm damn proud to be an American. Unfortunately, I'm not proud of many things that our government has, and is, doing. Celebrate? Yes, of course I will. (I never pass up an opportunity to drink beer!) However, I anticipate that many 4th of July parties will, and should, have something like a black cloud hovering over them. It would be utterly snotty of us to pretend, for even just one day, that everything in the country is perfect.   And unfortunately, by the looks of the people who were buying flags today, my gut is telling me that snotty ignorance will prevail this holiday. The "ignore all" attitude will only be exceeded by obnoxious patriotism. "WE'RE THE BEST FUCKING COUNTRY, DUDE. EVERYBODY ELSE CAN FUCK OFF!"  This mentality, I think, is not right.  It's on a day, such as the 4th of July, when we should all take a good hard look at our country. At our accomplishments, as well as our mistakes. We need to look at where we've been, and most of all, where we want to go. Be PROUD, but don't be ignorant.

I wouldn't doubt that this is probably true. And that is some scary shit. Of course, before I answer this question, I will have to educate myself on this subject.

      Men  say  they are interested in smart, independent women, but in their heart of hearts, I think they are full of crap. I think men are afraid of intelligent woman. Strong woman can not be dominated, and men feel it is their place to dominate women. Why do they feel this way? Well, we all know it's from centuries of women being repressed, so I am not going to get into the characteristics of gender inequality right now. That's not really my point. What I am simply trying to find out is this: Do men prefer dating/marrying ditzes? Is the dumb blonde the ideal wife for a man? When a woman challenges a man intellectually do they really feel emasculated?  I'm tempted to try an experiment, and act like a ditz. I'm curious to see what the results of this would be. What type of men would I attract? How would I be treated? Better or worse, then now?  Not that it can really get any worse then now. As of right now, I'm not getting anywhere. Just my heart being crushed over and over again.   So, I guess, basically, I'm just wondering why it so hard for an intelligent girl to find a good man?

       USA TODAY analysis found that what students actually pay in tuition and fees - rather than the published tuition price - has declined for a vast majority of students attending four-year public universities. In fact, today's students have enjoyed the greatest improvement in college affordability since the GI bill provided benefits for returning World War II veterans.   Bullshit. Well, it's bullshit if you live in California, like I do. How do I know this? Let's call it personal experience. Every single semester since 2002 tuition prices have gone up. And every single semester I get pissed off. Don't even get me started on the cost of summer school classes. Naturally, they are more expensive then the usual semester cost, but they have almost doubled in two years. That's right, doubled! To give you an idea at the insane cost of attending summer school, at a California State University, I will be so kind and share with you what I paid. Hold on to your seats. It was $583.00. For ONE class! Give or take a few bucks. And that's not including the cost of books or a parking pass my dear friends.   Disgusting, isn't it?

      Oh man, as if hot dogs don't contrive enough dirty-minded giggling, now, thanks to Seth Stevenson's article, Ads That Make You Go Ew -   urlLink Who buys hot dogs because they're "girthy"?  I'm doomed for the rest of my life to associate hot dogs with perverted sex acts; " I've no doubt that many hot dog consumers also perform fellatio.And more power to them. But do they really wish to contemplate this act while noshing on a frank at a barbecue? "  There's a mental image for you.  Seriously though, this article is to funny. However, it leaves me wondering, just how much spare time one has to do a piece on  this . About the "girth" of a hot dog!  Also mentioned:  There was a spot this spring in which a sweaty guy rubs a Coke can around in his armpit, then hands the can to a friend who unknowingly drinks from it.   Good stuff.

      Oh. How I love the movie "Office Space." There are so many moments in that movie that I can relate to. Although, I suppose anybody who works in a corporate office, will be able to find many scenes that are mimicked in their own offices. However, that doesn't in any way, lessen the significance that the movie has on me.  But I digress. I did not start this blog with the intention of talking about this movie. What I wanted to say was, how today, is such a typical shitty Monday. Indeed. In every way possible.   I'm behind on my reading. I only read one of three homework assignments. I read, Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper," which by the way, I LOVE! It is a very disturbing story that follows a woman's fall into insanity. Now, I still have to read, Edith Wharton's "Souls Belated" and Mary E. Wilkins Freeman's, "The Revolt of Mother." I only hope they are not long stories, for I have a disgusting amount of work piling up on my desk.   Ugh. What a  disgusting  monday.

      Kerry is citing Langston Hughes. I find that interesting. The  urlLink poem  he cited is a nice poem and all, but if I am not mistaken, isn't it a shout out for a Communist revolution?   As  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  pointed out, "The poem is rooted in the notion that the ideal of American freedom was a lie from the beginning for many people, and that public ownership of private property was the only hope:   I am the young man, full of strength and hope, Tangled in that ancient endless chain Of profit, power, gain, of grab the land! Of grab the gold! Of grab the ways of satisfying need! Of work the men! Of take the pay! Of owning everything for one's own greed!   Then there's this:   Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death, The rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies, We, the people, must redeem The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers. The mountains and the endless plain-- All, all the stretch of these great green states-- And make America again!    Not  that this really needs to be pointed out. I think if you read the poem it becomes fairly obvious.   And  this  is what Kerry is quoting. A poem from a man who wanted to abolish private property and loved Stalin. Heh. Nice. You would think that a person might want to understand something, before they say it. But that's just me. Call me crazy.

      Oh, I just love this  urlLink guy . Interesting piece on a transitive verb.    If things go on like this—which in a way I sometimes hope they do—we will reach the point where newspapers will report exchanges deadpan, like this:   " 'Fuck off,' he shot back." " 'Fuck off,' he suggested."  " 'Fuck off,' he opined." " 'Fuck off,' he advised." " 'Fuck off,' he averred." " 'Fuck off,' he joked."  Or even, " 'Fuck off,' he quipped."   Right then. Off we fuck.

      Ok. When I heard about this  urlLink story , you know, the one where 23-year-old reading specialist, Debra Lafave, is "accused of having sex with a 14-year-old student at least five times at her home, at school and in the back of her SUV," I thought to myself,  again . It's not like we haven't heard about these types of stories before. However, I find this story a little bit more disturbing. I think because, I'm more closely related to this woman's age. Plus, she has sex WITH A 14 YEAR OLD! A 14 YEAR OLD! If he was 17, maybe I could have some compassion for this woman, but this kid is SERIOUSLY young! AND SHE IS 23! I'm 25, and I think anyone under 21 is to young ... and even  that  is a stretch.   Once again, I'm forced to asked my favorite question: What is  wrong  with people?  Ah, but what the hell do I know. She'll forever be remembered as the teacher who had sex with a 14yr old (that alone would make me want to tie a rope around my neck), she'll write a book and make millions. Hmm. Maybe she had a 10yr plan in mind, after all.

      When I heard on the  urlLink news  this morning, "A group of armed, masked Iraqi men threatened Tuesday to kill Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi if he did not immediately leave the country, accusing him of murdering innocent Iraqis and defiling the Muslim religion," my first thought was - FINALLY! Shit. Why has it taken so long. It's about time.    In a videotape sent to the al-Arabiya television station, a group calling itself the "Salvation Movement," questioned how al-Zarqawi could use Islam to justify the killing of innocent civilians, the targeting of government officials and the kidnapping and beheading of foreigners.   Why is this guy so hard to find?

      So, it's going to be a Kerry - Edwards ticket. I have to admit, I was a little surprised to hear the announcement this morning. However, I think Kerry made a very strategic move by picking Edwards as his running mate. Even though Edwards only won one primary, if I remember correctly, he was very well liked by many voters. Not to mention, the southern states. This will  definitely  help Kerry win over the southern states. Personally, I like Edwards. More importantly, I TRUST Edwards. Why? I have no idea. Don't get me wrong, I trust  all  politicians about as far as I could throw one of them, but nonetheless, I trust him more then I trust Kerry. Does this mean I will vote for Kerry now? I have no idea. But now I'm definitely at least  considering  it! Good move on Kerry's part -indeed.

      So blogging, must unfortunately, come in second place today. I'm currently reading Robert Frost, who I just adore. One of our required readings is a poem entitled, "Fire and Ice," which I would like to share with you. I hope it is as enjoyable to you, as it is to me.     Fire and Ice  --Robert Frost  Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice. From what I've tasted of desire I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate To say that for destruction ice Is also great And would suffice.

      It's hot here, true July. All is forgiven. The mornings are bright, the noon is cruel, the afternoons are long, the evenings slightly breezy and finally around 1am, perfection. After 7 nights of sitting outside with chilled beers listening to the  chirp-chirp-chirp  of the crickets, it now feels as if it's always been this way. Such are the delusions that let us accept winter as something normal, instead of a vast manifestation of existential despair. (And I like winter.)  Back To The Future is on the tube. An all time classic, in my opinion. The entire trilogy, really, is pure fun and enjoyment. I actually remember watching part 2 in the movie theatre with my dad and my brother. Afterwards, my brother (who was only 9 years old at the time) insisted that "hover boards" existed. I don't know how he did it, but he convinced my father to call every store imaginable and ask if they had any for sale. Surprisingly, my father was told that they sold out of the item. Sure. Right. I bet they thought my father was some nut, and they would have said anything to get him off the phone.  "Excuse me, do you guys sell...hover boards?"  " Sure  we do. They're right next to the Moon Walking shoes, and the aluminum body suit."  "Would that be in sporting goods?"   I've actually driven a DeLorean. You know, the car they use in the movie to time travel in. From what I've been told, there are only a few of these cars still around. In fact, all the owners of this car know each other; they are a club. I'm guessing they sit around talking about Back To The Future on the first Thursday of every month. They laugh and share their favorite moments over cold beers and Van Halen music. But, you know, there is always  somebody  who has to ruin the good mood by bring up argumentative points. Last month it was Bob. This month it's Stan. Stan things it's nuts to believe that our lives are based on one simple time line. How can one decision that was made in 1885 (part 3) have any real significance to your life in 1985? "Damn you, IT CAN'T!" Yells Stan. Beers are thrown to ground. Men scramble to their feet. There is yelling and screaming, until finally Stan can take no more and he angrily storms out of the garage. Don't worry. He'll be back next month. He's old now, and this is really the only thing he has to look forward to.  Did you know that you can purchase "flux capacitators?" Well you can. And driving this car. Whoa. The  coolest  thing I have ever driven. When I hit 88 miles per hour, I swear to you, it felt like I could actually time travel. I'm not kidding. It made me feel young. Nostalgic for my youth. But in a good way.     Back To The Future II  But enough of this. I have to go. My grandparents are in town visiting for the next four days, and I can't begin to tell you how thrilled I am. It's been over a year since I've seen them, and I love them dearly. They've been married for nearly 55 years and they are still madly in love. I've never seen anything like it. You can see it in their eyes. When they hold hands. It's adorable. And it's what I want out of life. Coming from a divorced family, I look to my grandparents relationship as the ideal. It makes me think, and it brings up a lot of questions about love and marriage and family. But alas, this is subject for another blog at another time.   Blogging  may  be light for the next few days. But, since I am a computer dork, you can probably count on me saying  something . That is if you care. (eyes pleading.) Which I hope you do.   &hearts;  Before I go, here are some money quotes from the movie.    Marty McFly:  Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?   Dr. Emmett Brown:  The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?  . . .   Dr. Emmett Brown:  If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit.  . . .  [Dr. Emmet Brown is doubting Marty McFly's story about that he is from the future]   Dr. Emmett Brown:  Then tell me, "future boy", who is president in the United States in 1985?   Marty McFly:  Ronald Reagan.   Dr. Emmett Brown: Ronald Reagan?  The actor?  [chuckles in disbelief]   Dr. Emmett Brown:  Who's Vice President? Jerry Lewis?   Marty McFly:  What?   Dr. Emmett Brown:  I suppose Jane Wyman is the first lady. And Jack Benny is secretary of the treasury. I've had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy.  . . .  Marty McFly:  Wait a minute, Doc, are you trying to tell me that my mother has got the hots for me?   Dr. Emmett Brown:  Precisely.   Marty McFly:  Whoa, this is heavy.   Dr. Emmett Brown:  There's that word again; "heavy". Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the earth's gravitational pull?  . . .  Biff Tannen:  I have your car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is LIGHT beer?  . . .

      To be honest with you, I thought I was done blogging today. But oh no. Here I am again. Truth be told, I'm waiting for my best friend to get her butt over here and pick me up so we can go eat dinner. She is NEVER on time, and it drives me insane! Ok. Never is a harsh word. I guess my hunger is driving my emotions at the moment. It can do that, you know. Sure, hunger isn't quite like sleep depervation, but it still produces some pretty bizarre effects.  &nbsp;  But I'm slipping away from the topic.  &nbsp;  What  is  the topic, you must be wondering.   It is this - Forget about the war on terror. Forget about the culture war. Forget about the war on drugs. Forget all of it, I tell you. For there is a MUCH bigger war going on right now.  &nbsp;  What war?  &nbsp;  The  urlLink Conservative 'Ketchup War'   &nbsp;  Oh yes. I'm not kidding. And believe me, I  wish  I was.

      You know, I wasn't going to say anything, but I can't help myself.  urlLink Martha Stewart  is going to jail.     Martha Stewart was sentenced Friday to five months in prison for a stock-trading scandal, moving one step closer to a drastically different lifestyle behind bars when the millionaire entrepreneur.  "I'll be back," she promised afterward, speaking in a strong voice on the courthouse steps. "I'm not afraid. Not afraid whatsoever. I'm very sorry it had to come to this."   Am I the only one who finds this entire situation funny?   To be perfectly honest with you, I could care less about good old Martha.  Should  she being going to jail? Absolutely. HOWEVER. To put her in jail, while scumbags from Enron (or any other huge corporation for that matter) only receive slaps on the wrists, seems to me, to be somewhat wrong.   Well they made a great example out of Martha. They sure showed us. Boy, I'll tell you, I'll  never  jump on the stock-tip/trading bandwagon. Oh no. Not me. Never.   Unless, of course, I donate considerable sums of money, to the whatever current political party, is in charge of the country. Because then. And only then. Will you be able to get away with it.   Somebody  really  should have told Martha this.

        "I feel so empty right now Nothing to inspire me, but somehow  I keep on dreaming a way - hoping I will wake up soon some day"    I think it is safe to say that almost everyone is looking for one "true" thing in life, and that thing is "happiness." I know it is something I have touched with the tips of my fingers, but for some reason or another have not managed to hold on to ... I desperately long for it.   Even though it is not explicitly acknowledged, different 'theories' of happiness---or of what makes for 'the good life'---are firmly rooted in decades-old philosophical assumptions.   Plato , espoused a very rationalistic view of happiness. He felt that happiness means being a "just' person. Such a person is one in whom the three parts of the psyche---reason, the will, and the appetites---are in balance, such that each is able to perform its duty fully and without interference from the other.   It should be noted, of course, that Plato felt this type of happiness is achieved by only a select few people, namely the "philosopher kings" of his time.  For  Marcus Aurelius  true happiness (or at least some modicum of peace or neutrality) arises under three major conditions: when we fully accept Nature, society, and ourselves; when we engage in complete self-absorption; and when we exercise our daily duty to others and to society.   My own understanding of Aurelius leads me to consider his a "happiness by default"---one becomes happy when one is not subject to the pain that occurs in the absence of these conditions.    Sigmund Freud  conspired to render happiness a dubious, even suspect notion. Freud could only offer his patients "ordinary unhappiness" as relief from their neurotic suffering.  The  Hedonism Theory,  in all its variants, holds that happiness is a matter of raw subjective feeling. A happy life maximizes feelings of pleasure and minimizes pain. A happy person smiles a lot, is ebullient, bright eyed and bushy tailed; her pleasures are intense and many, her pains are few and far between. This theory has its modern conceptual roots in Bentham's utilitarianism, its contagion in Hollywood entertainment, its grossest manifestation in American consumerism.  The  Desire Theory  can do better than Hedonism. It holds that happiness is a matter of  getting what you want , with the content of the "want" left up to the person who does the wanting. Desire theory subsumes hedonism when what we want is lots of pleasure and little pain.   My principle objection to desire theory is that one might desire only to collect china tea cups or orgasms or only to listen to Country and Western music or to count fallen leaves all day long. The world's largest collection of tea cups, no matter how "satisfying," does not seem to add up to much of a happy life. One move to deflect this objection is to limit the scope of desire theory to the fulfillment of only those desires that one would have if one aimed at an objective list of what is truly worthwhile in life.  The  Objective List Theory  lodges happiness outside of feeling and onto a list of "truly valuable" things in the real world. Such a list might include career accomplishments, friendship, freedom from disease and pain, material comforts, civic spirit, beauty, education, love, knowledge, and good conscience.   Then there are those, from Saint-Juste to the situationists, with detours through Stendhal and Baudelaire, who take happiness seriously as a political claim. For these writers, happiness was an idea that needed to be liberated from the aristocracy and made available to all of humanity.   Perhaps the question is completely moot when we ask ourselves whether "happiness" even exists in the first place.  Both Plato and Marcus Aurelius---as well as Western society in general---use the word "happiness", leading one to believe that there is such a thing as happiness that can be understood and apprehended. There is some universal feeling so common to all of us that it deserves its own label.  But what if this feeling does not exist?  What if we have created the word "happiness" to describe a plethora of  different  feelings? Are any of us talking about the same  thing ? Worse, are we trying to create definitions that reify a purely linguistic term? If so, what are our personal, cultural, and political motivations for doing so? Any consideration of the "best" perspective on happiness must include extensive---and intensive---reflection on these critical questions.  Mark Kingwell wrote that happiness means to feel that one is living a life worth living. Many people find this definition profoundly empty or anxiety-provoking because it doesn't give them anything they can work with. In fact, some say that it makes them feel even unhappier. But the alternative---prescribing happiness formulas---is ultimately doomed to failure. The minute we try to dictate what happiness is, or should be, we place individuals in a passive, powerless position. We succeed in telling them that they do not know enough about themselves or the world to apprehend and/or appreciate the true meaning of happiness. If placed in such a position, will not some individuals feel that they are actually  unworthy  of happiness? If I thought myself too stupid to apprehend happiness on my own, would I feel I deserved to be happy in the first place?   Kingwell's special bugaboo is Prozac. He doesn't blame people for turning to happy pills --confronted as they are by what he calls "consumerism, psychopharmacology and therapeutic fetishism." But he does criticize psychiatrists for pathologizing unhappiness, thereby subtly ratcheting up the social pressure to be happy. In the end, he comes down firmly on the side of Aristotle's notion of happiness -- an austere idea that you're only as happy as you are virtuous.  I think Todd Solondz's film "Happiness" more or less summed up the prevailing sense that happiness has become at best a kind of pathology: a smiley face plastered over the dark nightmare of American suburbia.   =)

      Another day gone, another lunch hour wasted. And I've got absolutely nothing to show of it. What is it I'm supposed to be showing, you ask? A thesis for my term paper would be nice. Perhaps even a paragraph or two. Anything more then that would, of course, be entirely way to much to ask. Obviously. The queen of procrastination here, can't even get a thesis statement. I don't understand what my problem is. I'm usually so motivated to write. Granted, writing term papers isn't exactly the most  exciting  task. But even still, I manage to incorporate my own creativity. My papers are always drenched in cynicism and dripping with sarcasm. And they're funny. Not funny in the sense you're going to burst out laughing (unless that was my intention) but funny in the dark comical satire way. I usually have no problem getting started on these type of assignments.   Except for now.   And my boss just dropped an abundance of work on my desk, and asked me in the most obnoxious and pretentious manner, if I would be so kind to do this "special project" for him. A question, which so obviously, could never be answered with a simple "NO."  Cut the shit I want to say. Just tell me what you want me to do. And I'll do it. I'll tip my hat, give a salute and somehow under my breath manage to muster a, "yes sir."

      Whew. Finally, something positive coming out of the Senate.  urlLink Senate Vote Blocks Effort to Ban Gay-Marriage in Constitution    Backers of a constitutional amendment to prohibit same-sex marriages suffered a stinging defeat in the Senate today as opponents easily killed the initiative for the year in a procedural showdown.  Senators voted 50 to 48 against a call to cut off debate, 12 votes short of the 60 required and even below a simple majority of 51. It would have taken 67 votes to approve the amendment itself.   Money quotes:   "This is an unnecessary amendment that wrongly and certainly prematurely deprives states of their traditional ability to define marriage," said Senator Joseph Lieberman.  "No matter what one's position is on the socially divisive questions of same-sex marriage, civil unions and other nontraditional arrangements, the Constitution is not the place to engrave social policy - as we should have learned eight decades ago with Prohibition. Some true constitutionalists of both parties, to their credit, realize that." -  urlLink The Plain Dealer    "This is a symbolic but important blow to the agenda of the far right. They have divided their party, and tarnished their reputation for fairness - but the Constitution remains intact and unviolated. That's one reason to cheer." - Andrew Sullivan

      The Thing (from Marvel Comics, "Fantastic Four") is  urlLink Jewish .   Awesome.   Of course, it makes total sense that he would be.   It's noted that a high percentage of the early comic book artists were Jewish (Stan Lee, for example was born Stan Lieber). "Quite a few of them disguised themselves -- that's what you did to get your foot in the door," Brevoort said, adding that the creations of these closeted Jews were, quite often, disguised personal stories.   Well, these Jews have been "outed" now. Actually, they were "outed" a few years ago. I just happened to run across this little piece of information today. I guess that just goes to show how comic book savvy I am. heh.

      Last night I saw the movie Rear Window. It was an alright flick about a writer who is going through a divorce, which ultimately gives him a severe case of writers block and in a predictable Fight Club-type twist you realize that the guy is crazy and he ends up killing everybody. If you haven't seen it, but were desperately anticipating your opportunity to see it, I apologize if my brief description somehow ruined the suspense of the movie for you. But honestly, you're not missing anything. Really. You're not.   The only good thing about this movie was Johnny Depp. *flutters eyelashes*  he's dreamy.  I remember him back to his Cry Baby days. Now  that  movie is pure cheese. Good stuff.  And you know, it's not everyday that a girl can reflect on her Teen Beat magazines and fantasize about  the same  actor. His posters graced my walls with the company of Cory Haim and Cory Feldman. And  where  are those guys today? Hmmm? Certainly not where Depp is.  That's  for sure!   Speaking of Johnny Depp, do I dare bring up the subject of - Willy Wonka? The  remake . As much as I love Johnny Depp, and I don't doubt that he will do a great job, I think this is horrible idea. Is American cinema so lacking in original thought that every classic has to be remade? Give me a break. I know there are thousands of screenwriters out there with brilliant and innovate screenplays trying desperately to infiltrate Hollywood. But oh no. Oh no no no no no. Instead, films like Predator Vs Alien, I-Robot, and every single video game imaginable gets turned into a movie. The same thing is being done over and over and over again. NOTHING original anymore. It's quite sad.  If they remake Goonies, I'll cut out my eyeballs and sew the lids shut in a massive protest.

Evidently,  The French woman who claimed last week she had been the victim of a vicious anti-Semitic attack admitted to police that she had made up the entire incident, and was detained for falsely reporting a crime.   The woman -- identified in the French press as Marie-Leonie L. -- said she had drawn the swastikas on her own stomach with the help of her boyfriend, according to police.   That is one seriously messed up girl.

      A good friend of mine, emailed me earlier today, and asked me what I would think if she decided to join match.com. A friend of hers went on a date last night with somebody she met of this site, and evidently had a fabulous time. They hit it right off. The sparks flew. Instant match.   Excuse me as I gag.  Seriously though, her question has led to me ponder,  just what do I think of romance on the internet ? Can it really work? And if so, for how many?   There is a part of me that thinks in a world such of ours, one that is filled with technology, that yes, of course online dating can and will be successful. However, there is also a part of me that is very skeptical. Well, maybe skeptical isn't the word I'm looking for. It's more like, online dating, gives me a bad taste in my mouth. It's like a small part of me still views it with distaste.    "Oh.  You  had to meet  somebody  online, huh?" [Turning to other friends to laugh.] " How pathetic."   Please don't misunderstand me. I know this isn't true. I know that online dating is very popular. And in fact, logically, I have nothing against it. It's just that I still have this stereotype set in  my head. And truth be told, I've met people from websites such as myspace, and friendsters, so I'm not against the entire process. The difference in meetings, however, was that I didn't harbor any romantic notions. I didn't expect to meet the love of my life, I was simply meeting friends. Which, by the way, was a success on almost all accounts.   But, I'm a clever girl and I realize that, yes, I have a negative and perhaps unfair perception about online dating. The truth of the matter is, who am I to say that it won't work. It is for that reason, I told my friend to try it. WHY NOT? One of my personal philosophies is to try anything, at least once. How will you know whether it is a success or failure, if you don't at least try.  Right?

      In regards to Michael Moore, and his movie F-9/11, there are a few things I would like to clear up. I'll do my best to keep this very simplistic. Mainly because I am SICK TO DEATH of this topic.  First off, I have seen the movie, and like everybody has said it is pure propaganda. And that's okay. That was a given.  I found the movie to be funny, and surprisingly, boring. In my opinion it seriously lagged. And at times, it got me angry. I hated that he made the soldiers in Iraq look like fools.   They are kids!  18 and 19 years old. What do you expect. And not only that, it's not their fault that they are there. It's the governments fault. Blame Bush, I do. But don't blame the kids fighting. That really irritates me. And I can see how some would think that to be anti-American.   Now here is where I am conflicted. To say you hate the movie, or Michael Moore, is then like saying you are a Bush fan. However, I do NOT like Michael Moore, and I am NOT a Bush fan.   See the conflict?   Moore is a liar. He straight out lies in F-9/11, just like he did in BFC. Bush is liar. Where  are  those WMD?   Therefore, I don't believe one, anymore then I believe the other.   And now, I am done talking about Michael Moore.   Fin.   (Of course I reserve the right to bring up this topic again, whenever the fancy strikes me. Heh)

      Next week my term paper is due for my American Literature summer class. I've decided to have the focus of my paper center on the theme of feminism, or more specificity, the female "space." You have to remember that the novels and short stories, and poems that I am reading were written either before or between the World Wars, so female and male space at that time was significantly structured. Women were meant to occupy the domestic sphere while men spent their time in the public sphere. Fucked up? Yes of course. And I thank the early women's movement for bringing about change. Now don't get me wrong. I'm not some crazy psycho feminist. As a women, yes of course, I believe in women's rights. But I'm no Gloria Steinem, that's for sure.   But I'm off topic. The only reason I am writing on this topic is because we have been reading so many stories about repressed women, so my research will be fruitful. Of course, if any of you have any opinions on feminism, I would love to hear them.   I also would like to point out, that I think David Fincher should turn the short story "The Yellow Wallpaper," by Charlotte Perkins Gilman into a movie. If he updated it - oh boy! I think it could be better then Fight Club. Seriously. It's a twisted story. If you haven't read it, I suggest you do. In fact, you can read it  urlLink here  online.

      Don't buy  urlLink Budweiser  because the owners are keeping orcas in captivity? Are you fucking KIDDING me?!   Surprising as it sounds, the American brewer of Budweiser, Anheuser-Busch, also owns the SeaWorld chain, home to several performing killer whales. A British group, Born Free, has no problem with beer, but believes that it is cruel to keep animals in captivity. The most prominent case is that of Corky the orca, currently living at SeaWorld San Diego. For more than a decade, Born Free has advocated a boycott of Budweiser and Michelob as a way of putting pressure on Anheuser-Busch to release Corky and its other orcas. No data was available with which to gauge the boycott's success.   I've been to SeaWorld, and don't consider what they are doing to be animal cruelty. Wouldn't you then, have to consider zoos animal cruelty too? I know there are some people who think that, but I personally don't.

      So, it's Monday, and that means back to work. I hate Mondays here at the office. Work is always piled extraordinarily high.   I had a nice weekend. Surprisingly enough, I spent most of my time AWAY from the computer. It was nice, but I have to admit, I missed my dear friend. And of course, now when I am aching to spend my morning perusing the newspapers and my favorite blogs, I have to instead - work. Ugh. How unfair. ;)  I can sum up my weekend for you in this short dialect I had with a customer at Target on Sunday. I hope you find it as nauseating as I do. In fact, it characterizes the entire population of people in Orange County.   I was next in line to check out, when the manager asked me to move to another check out lane.

      I want to make this a quick blog because I've had a few beers and I'm dead tired. However, a little while ago I had a conversation with my best friend that made me do some serious thinking.   Here's what's on my mind: marriage. Yes. Marriage.  I'll be turning 26 in exactly one week. July 31st, to be exact. And now that you all know when my birthday is, please send all gifts (no cash please, however checks are accepted) to the following address. 263- JUST KIDDING! What? Did you think I was serious? If you did, please email me and I'll set you up with all the correct information. ;)  Seriously though, I'm getting older and as much as I hate to admit it, my biological clock is ticking. God, that sounds so Marisa Tomei from the movie My Cousin Vinny. And yet, it is so disgustingly true.   When I was younger, say 15/16-ish, I thought I would be married and on my way to having kids by now. I thought life was so Beverly Hills 90210. Perfect little outfits and perfect little boyfriends. Perfect little lives.  Talk about delusional.   Here I am, almost 26, and far,  very  far from being married with children. I'm certainly nowhere close to being Peggy and Al Bundy. Which I guess upon reflection, is a good thing.   But the truth of the matter is, I want to be married. No. That's not right. Let me rephrase. I want to  get  married. Being married right now, well that would probably not be for the best. I think it would be better if I could take care of myself, before having to take care of somebody else as well. But I do want it. Someday. And as time slowly, but surely ticks by, I find myself thinking of this more and more. It doesn't help that my younger brother is engaged either. In fact, it makes me feel like I am in a race against time. And time is winning.   I wanted to have kids when I was 28. That leaves only two more years. Sure, anything is possible, and a lot can happen in 2 years, but is it really realistic for me to be thinking this? But more importantly, is what I really want?  You see, that's a hard question to answer. And that is the real question on my mind. Why is it that I feel I should be married and having children before I am 30? Is it because  I  want to? Or is it because there is still some kind of unwritten rule in society that women should settle down by a certain age? This all really falls into gender stereotypes if you think about it. Men who don't marry will always be considered "bachelors," while women become "old maids." OLD MAIDS! Yeah. There's a definition I want to be associated with. Why don't you just kill me now, please.   And that's only half the problem.    In addition, I won't settle. Sure, I bet if I really tried, I could find some sorry sap of a man and convince him that I'm the love of his life and the best thing to ever happen to him, and be married within the year. Or worse yet, I could track down my old boyfriend, say goodbye to any sort of self-esteem I've acquired, and marry him. But I'm not that kind of girl. I can't, and I won't settle. I deserve to be with someone I really do love. Somebody I will sacrifice my own life for. And my husband, whoever that may be, deserves that as well.   Perhaps, I'm too idealistic on this subject. Perhaps, this is my problem.  Don't get me wrong, I've come to terms with the idea that I might be alone for the rest of my life. Well, at least I've come to terms with that to the best of my ability. And really, I'm okay with that. But that just doesn't change the fact that I really  do  want to get married.   Then again, maybe I just want to wear a beautiful Vera Wang wedding dress.     Of course, I'd have to win the lottery to afford such a dress. But a girl can dream. Can't she?

      I've spent the majority of today doing research for a story I am writing, as well as for a school report. I think my eyes are going to explode out of their sockets if I look at my computer screen for even one more second. And yet, I will not let this stop me. Oh no. No way. There is just to much to do, and so little time.  How cliche is that.  Taking a break from my research I decided to read some of my favorite blogs. I had the privilege to read a few incredible stories over at  urlLink Notes From A Darkened Room . Good stuff. You should go read them to.   I'll leave you with a quote, and what is left of hot summer Saturday afternoon.   "I, with a deeper instinct, choose a man who compels my strength, who makes enormous demands on me, who does not doubt my courage or my toughness, who does not believe me naïve or innocent, who has the courage to treat me like a woman." ~Anaïs Nin

      Is Go-gurt  really  necessary? As a society are we so damn busy that we can no longer eat yogurt with a spoon? Is it  that  important for us to have yogurt  on the go ? I know when I wake up in the morning, I have one less thing to worry about, now that I don't have to sit down and eat my yogurt. I can save a precious 5 minutes by taking it on the go.   Yeah  right . I don't think so.   Call me old school, but I don't want to eat my yogurt out of a tube. It's kind of nauseating.  There seems to be a fine line between products that we actually need versus products that are completely useless.

      Listening to music from the 60s and 70s, mind-boggles me. Really. It does. Take for instance, Simon and Garfunkel, because that's who I am listening to right now.   "I have my books. And my poetry to protect me. I am shielded in my armor. Hiding in my room, safe in my womb - I touch no one and no one touches me. I am a rock. I am an island. And a rock feels no pain. And an island never cries." from the song "I am A Rock"   An island never cries ? What is  that  about? I love that song, but come on. An island never cries? (shakes head regretfully.) That's just to cheesy for me.  Hippie bullshit, I suppose. I can't say I hate it though. It's what I bloody grew up on. And please don't ask me why I'm listening to this. I really couldn't tell you. Sometimes, I just fancy to.   Go figure.

      I believe Linda Ronstadt had every right to dedicate the Eagles song, “Desperado" to Michael Moore. Why shouldn't she? It's freedom of speech. And I suppose, her own artistic expression.   In this respect, the audience also had every right to react they way they did.  They booed, stormed out of the theater and tore down posters.   Ok. So maybe the audience took it a step to far. What does ripping down posters really accomplish? A big fat nothing, I'll tell ya. In fact, the new owners of the Alladin Theater, have already made arrangements to have Ronstadt back at the venue this fall - - with Moore on backup vocals.  Moore on backup vocals? (Wraps rope around neck, and kicks chair out from under.) I'd rather die then hear that.  I know that politics have become the "in" thing. It's actually quite trendy. EVERYBODY is taking a side and then doing their best to "make a difference." Actors. Musicians. Even politicians. But you know what, there is a time and a place for people in the entertainment industry to express their view points. And when they are performing, in front of hundreds of thousands, this is NOT the time for it. I can honestly tell you that the majority of people there, don't give a crap. Now, I wouldn't have walked out of Linda Ronstadt's show, but at the same time, I don't want to hear about her love and devotion for Michael Moore.   However, please keep in mind, there is an exception to every rule.  If the music you are listening to is political in nature, well then, obviously if you are attending a concert you would expect the show to be political in nature. That's okay. In fact, that's great. Hell, go to  urlLink punkvoter  and purge yourself with political music.   Enjoy!

      I could talk about Sandy Berger shoving classified documents down his  urlLink pants . And stuffing his  urlLink socks . But, why bother. The story is constantly changing. Now I hear that the leather document holder was not “inadvertently” taken, as reported the previous day; it was Berger’s fault all along.  But there is no proof. Of anything. Boy, I bet Kerry is thrilled to have him on his team now.  Oh wait. AP has revised the story  again . Berger has severed connections to the Kerry camp.  Whoa. This ping pong game has lost my attention. I'm getting a headache from the constant back and forth motion: he did ~> this. No wait. He did   this side. Liar. He's on   I read somewhere, that somebody jokingly wanted to know if Berger was wearing boxers or briefs when he stuffed the documents down his pants. At first, I thought that was hilarious. But upon second thought, AND after picturing Sandy Berger in his underpants, I shudder at the thought. And now, sadly,  this  is the image scarred into my retina.   I warn you now. What ever  you do, don't picture Berger in his underpants!

      There is no doubt that America has one deluded perception toward sex. This  urlLink poor woman  was arrested in Texas for selling a vibrator. Although the charges have been dropped she had faced up to one year of jail time.    Texas law allows for the sale of sexual toys as long as they are billed as novelties. But when a person markets the items in a direct manner that shows how they are used in sex, it is considered criminal obscenity.  Does somebody  really  have to be shown how to use one of these things? Isn't it, somewhat, self explanatory?   According to reports in local media and residents of Burleson close to the issue who asked not to be identified, a few prominent citizens with strong Christian beliefs were angered by Webb and her activities. They asked police to investigate.   Are you kidding me! I'd tell those "residents" to mind their own G-d damn business. It's not like anybody was forcing them to attend these Passion Parties. Much less buy a vibrator. Good lord. These "residents" need to seriously get laid.

      First off, I would like to apologize for the jagged ramble that I posted yesterday. You see, that blog was not meant to be posted, until I edited it. Unfortunately, my monitor decided to blow. No warning signs. No sharp bright lights exploding onto the screen. Nada. Zilch. Nothing. It just went ... black.   At first I thought it was a power outage. Except the hard drive stayed on. So, I pulled a total computer-illiterate act of despair. I pressed buttons. All sorts of buttons. And many many buttons. And bingo. My blog was published.   Of course, I didn't even realize this until much later. Thankfully, I had a old monitor just laying around. Actually, I had been meaning to throw it away for some time now, but I just hadn't gotten around to it. Everything happens for a reason, I suppose. And after my financial aid check comes I will buy a grand new monitor.   So, there you have it. My excuse, or apology, or whatever you want to call it. And if you're wondering, why don't I just delete the damn mess of a blog, well, it's because I told myself I would  never  delete a blog once it's been published. Good or bad, I want to remember them all.   So be it.   Tomorrow it's back to work. We'll talk politics over bagels and lox. A fruit salad would be nice to. Maybe you could bring that. I'll bring the coffee. See you then.

      I absolutely just love spending time with my grandparents. They have such amazing stories to tell. In fact, I told my grandfather he should seriously consider writing a book. I wish I had the time to share some of these stories with you. But, alas, that is going to have to wait until Thursday or Friday at best. Because it is after then, that I have had the time to sit down and formulate the best way to tell these stories. Stories that will make you laugh. And make you cry.  Stories that include senior retirement condo association members. And security guards who are ninehundred and ninety two years old. And it would take a week from Friday to catch anybody, and that's if they don't have a heart attack first!  However, today MUST be dedicated to writing my term paper. YES! That DAMN term paper I have been bitching and moaning about for what feels like weeks now! It's due Thursday, and tomorrow I'm spending all day with the family. And Wednesday it's back to work. So you see, time is running out.   Do  not  doubt my skills as a procrastinator. I am the queen. And I will take anybody on. And I will win.

      4:30 A.M  - called in sick to work. Hey, it's a birthday present to myself. I told them I was sick to my stomach. Vomiting out of control. And I don't think that is really such a big lie, because after all, my coworkers DO make me sick to my stomach.  4:35 A.M - watch Valley Girl on HBO.  Like, for sure, it's a totally tubular movie!  Quick overview of the movie ...  She's cool. He's hot. She's from the Valley. He's not.  I've decided that the next retro flashback itching should totally be the VALLEY GIRLS.  Like why hasn't anyone thought about this before - duh? Its the perfect time. There's a Republican in the White House, guys are wearing mascara, hair-rockers are making a comeback, and Madonna never left. So the only thing missing from the eighties are the valley girls, or Vales, as they're known.  And yes. When I was like, 13, I thought it was so cool to be a Valley girl. I must have been on drugs.  The Valley Girl is a cult classic. Released in 1983, it starred Nicholas Cage and Deborah Foreman. She was the Valley Girl from Encino and he was the bad boy from Hollywood. It has a classic Romeo and Juliet theme; imagine like, hello, where art though. It was not so mainstream when it was made essentially because the valley girl was a local San Fernando Valley phenomenon. The posh suburbs housed the collective group known as the valley girls who had an entire culture built around a somewhat snobby attitude and great clothes and hair. Someone got the brilliant idea to make a movie out of it. Anyway, if you haven't seen it, rent it, it was a good flick.    Totally Tubular, Valley Girl.  5:25 A.M. - Return to bed. Yes, I didn't finish watching the movie, but I own it, so I can always watch it later. However, at this time I have a strange dream that included Deborah Foreman. I guess, I joined the Valley Girl gang. Lucky me.  6:15 A.M - Go to gym. Burn off my beloved booze.  7:00 A.M - Stop at Starbucks, and get a Caramel Frapachino. Yum. All the calories I just burned, have been replaced. Plus, I gained some additional calories as well.   Bastards.  8:oo A.M - Shower. Dress. Do all those lovely things that need to be done so I can face the world.   And well, now here it is 9:00 A.M and I am writing this blog. And then it's checking my email. And then ... I'm off to San Diego for the day. I'm headed down there with my best friend, so she can pick up her guitar.   Hey. Who knows. She has a guitar. I have a bass. It isn't entirely impossible, that we are in the making, of a brand new punk band.  Now we just need to learn how to play.   * * * Valley Girl money quotes:   Fred:  So, you wanna dance?   Girl:  In another life!   Fred:  Yeah, I didn't either. I was just taking a poll.    Randy:  That techno-rock you guys listen to is gutless.   "What I'm trying to say, Julie, is that it's really hard for me to say what I'm trying to say."  Tubular. I know.

      My father just called me. He asked if I wanted to have dinner at his house of Friday. It's a birthday dinner, he says. Right. Sure it is. It's more like an after thought. This dinner, in all actuality, is focused primarily around my brother's engagement. Which is fine. But don't tell me a lie.  My father, and I, have many issue. The way I dress. The color of my hair. Tattoos. "That funny thing in your lip.  Why  do you make yourself look ugly? Don't you care what other people think of you?"  Actually, dad. No. I don't.  You should.   I don't.  After hours of this relentless criticizing, and a tension beyond explanation, I'll come up with some pathetic excuse to take my leave early. But not before the look on my sister's face causes me so much guilt and grief, that I end up staying an additional few hours.  I'll yearn for alcohol. But I won't have any. I'll crave for just one itty bitty puff of a cigarette. But I won't dare take one.  This is my family. A father who calls and invites me over to his house once every 6 months. A stepmother who hates me. Yes, hates me. How do I know this? She told me. She doesn't hate me for the person I am. Oh no. She hates me because I'm my father's child. I'm guessing, nobody taught her how to share as a child. Hmm? It's a good thing I have enough sense to hate her back. Unfortunately, however, in the middle of all this, is my eight year old sister, who I love more then my life itself.   So, I'll go. And this will be my birthday dinner. I won't complain, at least not much. I suppose a dysfunctional family is better then no family at all. And, I have to admit, there is a part of me that is thrilled he called.   It's amazing, that an almost twenty-six year old, can still feel sixteen around her father. Desperately seeking his approval, and still coming in a disappointing second.

      I am going to tell you a story about a girl who didn't want to belong.   My great-grandmother, I would have liked to have known her. A wild horse of a woman, so wild she wouldn't marry. Until my great-grandfather threw a sack over her head and carried her off. Just like that. As if she were a fancy chandelier. That's the way he did it. And the story goes she never forgave him. She looked out the window her whole life. The way so many women sit their sadness on an elbow. I wonder if she made the best with what she got or was she sorry because she couldn't be all the things she wanted to be. I have inherited her name, but I DON'T want to inherit her place by the window. - Sandra Cisneros, from "The House On Mango Street"

      I actually caught the last half of the DNC last night. Just in time to hear Clinton's speech, in fact. And Umm. What can I say about this.   1) Clinton is a very comfortable and effective public speaker. I think he's most at ease in front of a very large crowd. I think it was a very good strategic move to have him speak on Monday, rather then a time closer to when Kerry will be giving his speech, because he would have shown up Kerry. For sure. Kerry is no where close to Clinton in this regard. Well, he's no where close to Clinton in a lot of aspects, but I'm not going to get into that right now. And don't confuse that statement with undying love for Clinton either. Because it's not. Yes, I do like Clinton more then Kerry, but I don't see him as some sort of Great President. He was good. Let's leave it at that.  2) Clinton's speech was amusing. He made personal cracks at the Republicans, who were "mean" to him in the past. And I think by bringing up how he benefited from the Bush tax-cuts was a pretty ingenious way to actually be knocking the tax-cuts down.  3)  I loved how Clinton said the Democratic party would not resort to name calling in this campaign, and then he proceeded to  tear  the Republicans down.   Yeah. He might not have resorted to actual "name calling" but hostility was pretty evident.   Flash to cameo of Michael Moore.   Was that  really  necessary?   I'm thinking Clinton did a pretty good job of getting a buzz circulating through the Democratic Party. Although, if he said, "Send Me" one more time, I was going to throw a rock through my Television set.  Speaking of television. Whenever I see Clinton these days, I can't help but think of Darryl Hammond doing his impression of him on Saturday Night Live. It's so unbelievably funny! And Will Farrell's impression of Bush. Oh man, that is some good stuff.   Quote from the  urlLink NYT : " He rattled off history, scripture, sarcasm and statistics, and drew the crowd into raucous echoes of carefully scripted applause lines that he made sound as spontaneous as kitchen-table talk."  "It's a little like a combination of rock star and religious leader," said Joe Lockhart, Mr. Clinton's former press secretary, by way of explaining the former president's enduring appeal to the faithful.   Umm. Right.

      Mondays = busy. But this, I have already told you. However, I did have a few minutes to head over to  urlLink Andrew Sullivan's  blog. I haven't read the entire thing, but I'm going to share with you what caught my eye.   Here's the roundup:  One of his readers pointed out that the HBO show,  urlLink Six Feet Under  has included several anti-Bush lines. This I find completely amusing. I watch that show, it's one of my favorites, but I don't recall hearing any anti-Bush one liners. Perhaps, I just don't pay close enough attention. The TV is on, but I don't just sit in front of it. I'm always doing something else. Oh well. I guess it's my own fault then, for missing such amusing antidotes.  Next -  If you're interested, here are the  urlLink bloggers  for the Democratic National Convention. I'll warn you now, that I have not checked out who exactly these bloggers are, so it's very possible they are all evil Republican bloggers.  I kid the Republican bloggers. I love the Republican bloggers.  And last but not least -  An interesting article over at Slate regarding  urlLink Kerry and Langston Hughes .  There you have it. I'm done. Stick a fork in me.

      At work this morning, a fellow coworker asked me in the most innocent and naive way if I was, "gothic." Then before I could answer, another coworker, replied that, no I was not gothic. I am punk. So here I am standing inbetween these two gigantic beasts of women, who together must total near 200 years old and 400 pounds, listening to them argue over what  I should be labeled.   Uh ... huh ... wha?  Gothic? Punk? Last time I checked, I thought I was just ME.   See -   I'm just me.  Why do we feel the need to label everything? We label people, sexuality, places, attitudes, politics, etc. What are we so scared of, that we feel this need to define and label everything and everyone?   Take for instance, this goth/punk issue that I found myself in the middle of. Now, I wear almost all black, all the time. I don't have anything against color, I just don't want people staring at me. It's kind of funny if you think about it; I don't care if people stare at me because I have a ring through my lip, or tats on my back, but I feel really uncomfortable when people stare at me when I have on, say a bright pink shirt. Or a red one. An orange, or  (gag)  yellow one. I just can't handle it. I feel  good  in black. Sexy. Confident. Why change my attire just because everyone seems to think I'm goth? Ok, so I have black hair and my finger nails are painted black too. I'm sure that doesn't help. And the truth of the matter is, I am somewhat goth. But more importantly, I'm  all  punk. Do I need have safety pins through all my clothes to stress this point? A mohawk?   I'm a punk rock girl, through and through, so I can't help it that I get bothered when called a goth. Wait. Let me correct myself. I don't get so much bothered, as annoyed. If I'm going to be labeled, LABEL ME CORRECTLY DAMN IT!  I could say more, but I don't have time. Let these half-baked, unsupported remarks carry the conversation a few more versts. It's early and I'm just sort of making this up as I go, anyway.  So please, by all means elaborate.

      I HATE MONDAYS!  The work on my desk is piling up. Seriously, as I type this, the work on my desk is piling up. And there is nothing else I can think, except that today is going to be a very long day indeed.   And I was so hoping to catch Clinton's speech at the Democratic Convention. Oh, wait a second. That's later tonight. Maybe I still can. If I still care, that is. Heh.  Since I can't really write anything right now. And since I have no idea when I will be able to see through the stacks of paper on my desk, I thought I would share a song with you. I'm listenting to it now. It's a song from the band  urlLink Tiger Army , and it's called,  urlLink Incorporeal . If you haven't heard Tiger Army, then you're missing out.    I'm dead I died long ago but my spirit still roams (Incorporeal) Unwanted in heaven, forgotten in hell as on earth (Incorporeal) I don't want to stay here, it seams that I'll never be free Oh can you hear me? (no)  And so It has come to be that I must wander forever (Incorporeal) Many things I have seen, empires that rise and then fall (Incorporeal) A life you live long is simply a moment to me A tiny drop of water in the sea of eternity  There's no place for me everywhere that I go Only seems to bring upset and harm There's one thing that I want and one thing only Release into the great beyond Don't want to remember when I was alive When I held my true love in my arms For like you I once was, and like me you shall be  When you Feel a chill in the night perhaps it's me saying hello (Incorporeal) You're so much like my love though she lived in a long ago time (Incorporeal) I long to see her for the day when my soul's laid to rest The peace that I can not find in life, I can find in death

      Once upon a time there were three little girls ... no wait, wrong show.   In September 1975 "Starsky and Hutch" premiered on ABC. In the 29 years since then, the pair of unorthodox, streetwise cops and their souped up hot rod Torino have become icons of disco style and violent-but-blood-free American television. Just a few notes of the "wakka-chicka" theme song is enough to transport anybody back to the 1970's.   Lord have mercy on us all.   On the surface, plain-clothes Detectives Starsky and Hutch were like chalk and cheese. Ken Hutchinson (David Soul) opted very much for the quiet life, being well read and deep thinking. Dave Starsky (Paul Michael Glaser), on the other hand, was louder and more brash; enjoying street life.   However, at second glance,  Starsky and Hutch  seems of a piece with  Baretta, The Streets of San Francisco , or even producer Aaron Spelling's own  Charlie's Angels --one more post-1960s police series with street smarts and social cognizance, that expresses at least a passing familiarity with youth culture. Yet on closer inspection, swarthy Dave Starsky and surfer/sensitive Ken Hutchinson, confirmed bachelors and disco-era prettyboys, seem to have taken the cop show maxim "Always watch your partner's back" well past their own private Rubicon.      The series was originally part of a logical progression by Spelling (with and without partner Leonard Goldberg) that traced the thread of the detective drama through the fraying social fabric at the end of the 1960s. Beginning with  The Mod Squad  (cops as hippies), this took him in logical sequence to  The Rookies  (cops as hippie commune),  S.W.A.T.  (cops as hippie commune turned collectivist cell/paramilitary cadre), and finally Charlie's Angels (ex-cops as burgeoning feminists/Manson Family pinups). This was before jettisoning the cop show altogether and simply leaching the raw hedonism out of 1960s liberalism--with  The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, Family  (sauteed in hubris), and ultimately, the neo-Sirkian  Beverly Hills 90210 and Melrose Place .  In this context, the freewheeling duo might seem the perfect bisecting point on a straight line between  Adam-12's  Reed and Malloy and  Miami Vice's  Crockett and Tubbs.  Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid  had ushered in the "buddy film" cycle, just then reaching its culmination with  All the President's Men , and in fact, the pair physically resemble no one so much as the high-gloss Redford and Hoffman assaying the golden boys of broadsheet expose, Woodward and Bernstein.   Yet viewed in retrospect, their bond seems at very least a curious one. Putting aside the ubiquitous costumes and leather, or Starsky's Coca-Cola-striped Ford Torino and Hutch's immense .357 Magnum handgun, which McLuhan or Freud might well have had a field day with, the drama always seems built around the specific gravity of their friendship. There is much of what can only be termed flirting--compliments, mutual admiration, sly winks, sidelong glances, knowing smiles. They are constantly touching each other or indulging in excruciating cheek and banter--or else going "undercover" in various fey disguises. All of the women who pass between them--and their number is considerable, including significant ones from their past--are revealed by the final commercial break as liars or users or criminals or fatal attractions. And should one wind up alone with a woman, the other invariably retreats to a bar and drowns his sorrows. Following the inevitable betrayal, it is not uncommon for the boys to collapse sobbing into each other's arms.  The tone of all this is uniformly playful, almost a parlor game for those in the know (not unlike Dirty Harry, whose most famous sequence--the bank robbery--is bookended on one side by Clint Eastwood biting into a hot dog, and on the other by a fire hydrant ejaculating over the attendant carnage). Meanwhile, the rather generic storylines consistently play fast and loose with gender.   Altogether, a fascinating digression for episodic television--especially considering that it was conducted apparently entirely beneath the pervasive radar of network censors.   To which I have to say: Good For Them.  As for the movie staring Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn and Snoop Dogg, well, I'll just say that I found it to be amusing. As remakes go, you pretty much know what to expect - gentle humor, a basic plot and a film that is carried by it's laughs and sheer sense of fun.      I think casting Snoop Dogg as Huggy Bear was brilliant. In my opinion, he stole the show. But then again, I'm not only easily amused, but I also happen to be a fan of Snoop. So I don't suggest taking my opinion to heart. Take it for what it is. Crap.  So why am I talking about this now? Because I watched the movie this morning, and evidently, I have nothing better to do with my time then go off on long drawn-out discussions about a show that originated before I was born.   Hmmm. I'm thinking it's time I get off my butt and go outside.  But it's so bright. And sunny.   Then again, maybe I'll drape black sheets over the windows, pop in another DVD, and wait until the sun goes down before I venture out into the world.  It's true. I am a vampire goddess.

      If you want to be totally certain of things, you must eliminate anything which is slightly doubtful. This immediately means that senses can't be trusted (because of illusions), and even maths isn't certain.

      It’s time for new animals to symbolize the democratic and republican parties. Forget donkeys and elephants.   Personally, I think democrats should be dogs. Dogs slobber all over you as long as you keep them fed. They’re also great at rolling over, playing dead and begging. Just like democrats.   Cats are supercilious self serving pricks who thank you for feeding them by shitting in your house. Just like a republican.   Then again, maybe democrats are kangaroos and republicans are eagles. Just thinking out loud here.

      Earlier today I came across a link to this site:  urlLink  re-code.  As far as I can tell, it’s a site that helps you generate barcodes to replace the ones stores have already affixed.   The products we purchase are the inventory of our lives. To chain stores, this inventory is cataloged through the Universal Product Locator symbol (UPC). The UPC symbol is known as a barcode. Barcodes are now found everywhere in our world, extending outside of product inventory into our comic books, our science fiction, our films, and even our tattoos.   Our  tattoos ?    In typical transaction scenarios, both consumer and cashier behave accordingly to accommodate the dominance of the barcode. Both depend on the accuracy of the code.   By which I think they mean: the clerk scans it, and I stand there waiting for all the items to be scanned. I usually watch the screen, which shows a running total. Sometimes the Barcode isn't right - and rebel that I am- I point this out. As Lileks said, "I realize that this is a dangerous path, and I may well end up in a prisoner--pyramid at Gitmo with a leash around my neck and a flashlight up my rectum, but you have to take a stand. Sometimes the code for avocados is out of date, and if means John Ashcroft will appear in a cloud of red smoke, drag you off to the backroom and beat your kidneys with phone books until you piss blood, then so be it."   Both function in machine-like behaviors in accordance to the patterns of traditional consumption rituals.   You are "engaging in a pattern of traditional consumption rituals." Right. Here I was thinking I was just buying some orange juice.  What must it be like to live your day seeing everything through the prism of this tiresome horseshit? I’m SHOPPING FOR DINNER, fool, and I am not functioning in a machine-like behavior.   In some situations, even the cashier has been removed, so a machine can now be controlled by only the barcode maneuvered by human hands.   Um - sure. Why the hell not?   but take tactical action to manipulate the existing system for consumer benefit. With RE-CODE.COM, we look for a way to highlight the absurdity of a system undermined by humans that relies primarily on our very own physical presence and continual acceptance. We must showcase the human through the subversion of the code.    And Neo gasps as the cortical unlink is crudely yanked from his head. I love this line: “the absurdity of a system undermined by humans that relies primarily on our very own physical presence and continual acceptance.” Do you grasp the piercing insight here? The stunning revelation?   We're all just sheep.   Okay. I got this ball rolling. Now it's  your  turn. I'm interested in your thoughts.

      I am a very important person. I've acquired a genetically altered handshake capable of speeds up to 30 mph. Hair arranged by the most advanced landscape surveillance operators our company can afford. I have a very expensive pen. I use big words quite often in substitution for semantically equivalent words. I attribute this success to my professional demeanor and my strong stock portfolio. Though it may not appear so, I am quite comfortable in my surroundings. I have everything, let me show you around. Smile you fucker, it's not often you get this chance. Love is just an exchange of corporate documents. I've reviewed your rapport and I feel you're a prospect for mechanical  salvation. This is a joint venture that will be mutually advantageous to both parties involved. Technically this is just a business merger. A consolidation of liquid assets. We are respectively geared towards customer service. There is a great possibility for corporate sponsorship if you're willing, I am sure we could synchronize agendas. Swift and efficient satisfaction through innovative planning, we could form a strong strategic partnership capable of overcoming sensitive and adverse predicaments which will be discussed at the next goals assessment meeting. Promotion possibility and additional benefits are diagrammed in my  preliminary objective outline. Raises are granted based on performance.

      At around 9:20 this morning (my first 10 minute break of the work day,) I had reached anger meltdown. "Bullshit, bullshit bullshit," I kept muttering. I couldn't stop yelling at the idiots who worked at my university.  Oh, the things I said to them within the confines of my own head. I was brilliant I tell you. I told them off, somethin' good. Realizing, of course, that I was just making myself nuts, I figured it best to actually hear what they administrators had to say. So, I called them on my break.  Automated answer. "Please press zero to speak to a representative." I press zero.  "Please hold, we're currently experiencing a high level of calls. We appreciate your patience and the next representative will be with you just as soon as possible."  So I hold.  And hold.  And hold.   Please hold, we're currently experiencing a high level of calls. We appreciate your patience and the next representative will be with you just as soon as possible.   "Fuck you!" I yell at automated voice. And I'm thinking, that if I hear this mechanical woman's voice one - more- time, I'm going to snap.  And yet, I continue to hold.  Of course by now, my 10 minute break, is turning into my 20 minute break. A terminating offense, I'm sure. And by this point, I'm beyond irritable. I'm in the parking lot walking in circles, screaming at the top of my lungs, words that would have made sailors blush. People are looking at me like I'm some kind of nut job, which irritates me even more, so start flipping them off. I'm hating everybody. No one is safe from the wrath of jenn.  And then she answers.   "Hi, my name is Suzy DumbShit. What can I do for you?"   Scatter my brains against the wall, please.   "Um, yeah. There's been some kind of mistake…"  Minutes later the conversation was over, and more surprisingly, my problem was fixed. Evidently, they never received my "loan request form."  How  this is possible, is beyond me. Considering my extreme need of financial aid, I find it somewhat surprising that I would simply forget to send in my "loan request form." No sense in arguing over this point though. I'll bring it in this afternoon, thank you very much and have a wonderful day.  I know you are all rejoicing for me. But please. Calm down. Maintain your excitement level to a minimum. And sorry, there are no refunds for your donations. The "jenn fund," will always be active, so please keep sending your charity in my direction.  You really have no idea how much I crack myself up  (knocks on head)  in here.  The car, once again in my grasp. Traveling to Europe, still a hope. Life is once again back to normal.  Whatever, that means.

        What I thought was a certainty Has left me, spinning in circles again     I'd just like to say, that my lack of financial funds is, literally, killing me. On a normal everyday basis, things are difficult. But survivable. I manage. I work the corporate 9 to 5. Breaking my back for the man, so I can pay the rent, put some food on the table, and you know, have electricity. Lights, are after all, are a good thing. And just what would I do without my trusty computer? There's a scary thought. In fact, I'd rather not even think about it. However, the most frustrating element, due to this situation, is the car factor. Yes. The car factor. The fact that my car is not only a hunk of junk, but that it is held together by duct tape. Yes. Duct tape.  Here's the generic duct tape schpiel:  Well, that’s why God made duct tape. Or rather why He set in motion the chain of events that made inert chemicals spark with life, embark on a long process that yielded ever-complex organisms that one day would develop, market, and purchase duct tape. We’ll live with it.   You've got to love duct tape, eh.  Anyway, it's quite evident that I am in need of a new car. I've been trying to save money, which has turned out to be a pathetic attempt by the way. It's impossible to save money when every dime you earn is needed to just - survive. However, I thought my luck had changed, when for my birthday, my aunt sent me a gift in the form of a considerably good sized check. So there I was. My arm stretched out. Hand open. Reaching with the tips of my fingers. Grasping to hold on to the dream of a shiny brand new car ...  In a matter of three days, circumstances, have taken a turn for the worse. My rent was raised. My health insurance is changing from a HMO to a PPO, which means that I now have to pay a $1000.00 deductible, at the very least. And now, for some unknown reason, my financial aid has been dropped. This means I owe the school  a lot  of money by next Tuesday. This also means, good bye new car.  Lucky school though. They were the recipient of some very explicit emails last night. And today, oh boy, are they going to be surprised when I show up and start making a scene. Ahahha. Oh yes. This can actually turn out fun yet.      Dear diary, my twenty-something angst bullshit has a body count I believe it's 6 going on 7 now. I've been dreaming about you, in a pool of your own blood, with your eyes gouged out by the work of my thumbs. The scent of your insides from under the floorboards, the perfect perfume to settle a score.  Ride the wings of pestilence.

      Okay, everybody. As promised I am adding a new element to this blog. Every week I plan to share with you, Bill Maher's, "New Rules." He is one of my favorite political comedians, probably for the simple that fact that A) he's funny, and B) he can smell a lie like a fart in a car. (He was also the host of Politically Incorrect, for those of you who don't know.) A lot of people have told me that I have an amazing ability to decipher bullshit. And that's true. It's a talent. I can't help it. But this guy. Well, he's just something else. And this is why I think you will appreciate his wit and sarcasm as much as I do. So enjoy.  Oh yeah. I should probably warn you now, that Bill Maher is not particularly fond of our current president, George W. Bush. So, if you're an uptight Republican, you probably won't find him to be all that amusing. However, he does make fun of  everybody . No one is spared by Maher. Not really.   So get a fucking sense of humor, and laugh damn it.   Are you ready? Because he we go -  New Rule: Political conventions are important and they deserve to be broadcast and viewed in their  entirety . You can’t call everyone in Washington "morons" if you don’t know exactly what it is that makes them morons.   Now, the conventional wisdom about conventions is that they’re no longer worthy of our attention because they’re too produced and there’s no drama. You want drama? Hitch a ride home with Ted Kennedy.   We’re picking a president here, not the "Last Comic Standing."  The media treats these conventions like pointless interruptions of their real job covering the Scott Peterson trial. No surprises, no excitement. Hey, you know what’s exciting? It’s exciting when politicians get drunk with power because people aren’t keeping an eye on them. No one expected we’d retaliate for 9/11 by attacking…Iraq!  Ooh, unpredictable, exciting!   And the reason the conventions are so "produced" is because if they weren’t, the networks wouldn’t air any of it. And the sight last night of John Kerry rushing through his speech in a cold sweat so that he wouldn’t go over time and force viewers to miss the first two minutes of "Elimidate,"  was one of the saddest moments in the history of democracy. The man is proposing how to rule the globe, and we treat him like it’s audition night at The Improv and he just got the light.   I’m not saying everyone has to pore over issues and read everything that’s out there. We can’t even get our president to do that. But the conventions are one of the only times when the election isn’t reduced to sound bites and attack ads. When you can get to know these people a little. It’s not exciting enough just to hear Theresa Heinz Kerry? Oh, I’m sorry, next time we’ll get Justin Timberlake to whip her tit out!  You know – you know, maybe the conventions aren’t boring. Maybe it’s the people who  don’t participate in their society  who are boring. You know, once every four years, the two parties put on a little pageant for you: "These are our faces. These are our voices. This is our vision of America’s future." You’d think that would be a little more interesting than reruns of "Celebrity Poker." But convention viewership was actually down two million. What does John Kerry have to do to get your attention? Fuck Amarosa?!   And one last thing. If you think the Democratic Convention was too slick, wait until the Republicans end their convention with Osama bin Laden making a grand entrance in chains from the back of the arena like King Kong!

      So I'm at the gym running to my little heart's content, which is the equivalent of 600 calories per hour, when it strikes me that this is utterly foolish.  I'm going nowhere. Not forward. Not back. Not up, nor down. Isn't it really just an illusion of progress?  Who invented this rubbish? Why do so many of us flock to gyms to run on machines that take us bloody nowhere? I find this all very frustrating and humiliating.  Until the endorphines kick in. And then, I feel pretty darn great.   This afternoon while I was running away, without running away at all, it struck me that I couldn't possibly be the only one who had such thoughts. And then I remembered  urlLink Chuck Palahniuk's  novel, "Survivor." Of course who better to say what my tired limbs and oxygen-free brain can currently not say for itself.    After just the first fifty flights of stairs, my breath won't stay inside me long enough to do any good. My feet fly out behind me. My heart is jumping against the ribs it's behind inside my chest. The insides of my mouth and tongue are thick and stuck together with dried-up spit. Where I'm at is one of those stair climbing machines the agent has installed. ... Around the sixtieth floor, sweat is stretching my shirt down to my knees. The lining of my lungs feels the way a ladder looks in nylon stockings, stretched, snagged, a tear. In my lungs. A rupture. The way a tire looks before a blowout, that's how my lungs feel. The way it smells when your electric heater or hair dryer burns off a layer of dust, that's how hot my ears feel."   Welcome to my hell.   On a side note, tomorrow I will implement a new forum to this here blog. It will become a weekly thing. I don't want to ruin the surprise, so I won't tell you what it is, but I'm betting you will be pleased. And if not, well then, you don't belong here anyway.  Adios amigos.

      Hello ladies and gentlemen. I'm glad you've graced me with your presence. You're in time to see me wrestling my conscience and staring into the silence.  First off, I wanted to say that I am now the proud owner of a new Samsung Camera Phone. In one electronic purchase of technological advance I have become the very essence of all those I loathe and despise. Or simply put, I have become one of those that I make fun of.  Evidently, my hypocrisy knows no bounds.  However, it does provide me with endless fun on a huge time wasting scale. You want to know something else that is interesting?   No, let me rephrase. It's  as  interesting. Or  more  interesting. Or less. I don't know. That was simply a lazy transitional device inserted to give this ramble some sort of narrative drive, as though I'm leading up to something; I'm not.   Basically, I took some awesome pictures with my newly purchased toy on the way down to San Diego. You want to see one? I know you do. So here you go:     On the drive to San Diego we witnessed this car spontaneously combust. I shit you not. Don't worry, the owner of this car was fine. No injuries to report here.  Unless you count the injury to my hypocritical ego. But I don't. So you shouldn't either.

      Birthdays, for me, are not only a time to party and paint the town red, but they are also a time to sit down and have a serious look at your life.   I hurt deep down in the pit of my stomach, my arms and my shoulders ache to be held tight...to be told that I am really loved for what I am.  We all have times when the chill of loneliness hits. Like a knife thrust into the stomach, feelings of emptiness, insecurity, rejection and isolation can send us reeling in pain and even incapacitate us.  It is sensory deprivation, slow torture, and my soul cries out for the company of a kindred spirit, for the comfort that only a friend can give, for someone who can fill the emptiness, who can share the isolated moments of my existence.   Loneliness weakens the spirit. It consumes our strength and dims our inner flame. It tempts us to wallow in self-pity, to descend into a kind of gloomy rapture, depressed and paralyzed, yet at the same time glorying in our misery, suffering proudly in our own private hell.   Escape as from a dungeon the self-inflicted misery of self-pity.   One may respond to the feelings of loneliness in a number of ways, but basically, we will in some way try to fill the  void .   The quick-fix, buy-it-now happiness of our Prozac culture.  The pain is beyond words: I just see the years pass by in front of my eyes, and I am still  wondering and wandering .   The real culprit though is how we interpret being separated or alone. Aloneness is the riddle we must solve in order to be worthy of the companionship of others, and therein lies the central paradox of being alone - that it can either ennoble, or degrade. The essential difference between aloneness and loneliness is the anguish, the acute hunger for contact, that the lonely suffer.   Could we but consider solitude a necessary journey of discovery, a crisis that may ultimately purify and strengthen us, then we would emerge from this Dark Night of the Soul uplifted and exalted, more fully realized as a person? Once comfortable in our own company, reconciled to the austere beauty of silence, of privacy, of total self-sufficiency, only then can we travel onward and explore the horizons of interaction, of exchange, or binding with our fellow humans.   I found that I am an interesting person, I am a joy and laughter to be with, and so I don't need these false personalities to make myself attractive to others. I don't feel that I have to be like others.  I raise my hopes and expectations but then again, wham, I am slammed down again. It really hurts every time that I hit the bottom – it hurts me physically, mentally, and spiritually. I begin doubting again; I loose my peace and I keep wondering and  wandering  . . .  You think you know me. But you have no idea.  I keep thinking and praying: "No, I cannot lose hope!" But let me tell you, spiritually strengthening myself at times such as these is very draining. You know what my situation reminds me of? I once saw animals that were slaughtered and hung so the blood may drain from them. I too feel like I am hung upside down, left for the blood . . . the life . . . and the spirit to drain from me. With every breath that I take, I feel my life is draining from me . . .   But I have not given up hope.

But, I would also like to say, HELLO people, why the hell are you all standing around stagnate water? That's a breeding ground for mosquito's. Use your brains ... get rid of the water! Sheesh.  I'm still moving though. So, if a cute little gothic punk girl shows up at your house, let her in, ok. Because,  smiles sweetly,  it will only be me.

      It is dark and wonderfully gloomy out. And I'm loving every second of it. I feel as if my soul cries out for a winter's day. For a gust a wind. For a chill in the air. For a harsh pounding of a true rainstorm. I long to see flashes of yellow bolt across the sky. And to hear the snap of thunder in my ears.   Unfortunately, that's not going to happen  any  time soon. This morning may be refreshingly gloomy, but the afternoon should bring an unbearable heat, once again. Yay! For triple digit weather. If melting was possible, I'd already have lost my legs.   Ew. What is this puddle of goo I'm standing in?  Oh, just my legs. You see they melted about an hour ago.  I thought you looked shorter today.   Sigh.  I'm depressing myself, so let's move on to the actual point of this blog  music. Yes, music. I'm happy to say, I've been receiving good feedback, in this department. Not that I was worried, mind you. I have impeccable taste in music. Heh. Seriously though, I am glad everybody is enjoying it.   So. This morning I've been all over the place, but I've settled on some good old fashioned punk rock. The band is Propagandhi, and the song is,  urlLink Back To The Motor League .   Enjoy.       ::Back To The Motor League::  I like to party fucking hard.  I like my rock and roll the same.  Don't give a fuck if I burn out.  Don't give a fuck if I fade away.   So back to the Motor-League with me  before I'm forced to face the wrath of a well-heeled buying public  who live vicariously through  tortured-artist, college-rock and floor-punching macho pabulum.   Back to the Motor League I go.  Once thought I drew a lucky hand.  Turned out to be a live grenade - of play-acting "anarchists" and Mommy's-little-skinheads,  death-threats and sycophants and wieners drunk on straight-edge.   Fuck off. Who cares?  I'd rather hi-lite Trip-Tiks than listen to your bullshit.   Fuck off. Who cares? About your stupid scenes, your shitty zines, the straw-men you build up to burn.   It never ceases to amaze and as I'm suffering your perfection it reminds me of my own race  to redress my own sad history of - Mouthed feet. Eaten hats. Teated bulls. Amish phone-books. Drunken brawls.   But what have we here?  15 years later it still reeks of eSwill and Chickenshit Conformists. With their fists in the air;  like-father, like-son "rebels bloated on korn, eminems and bizkits." Lord, hear our prayer:  take back your Amy Grant mosh-crews and your fair-weather politics.  Blow-dry my hair and stick me on a ten-speed.  Back to the Motor League.   I guess life is just a popularity contest.  Success, the ability to perform within a framework of obedience.  Just ask the candy-coated Joy-Cam rock-bands selling shoes for venture-capitalists, silencing competing messages, rounding off the jagged edges.       So. How many "burns" did you catch? Reread the lyrics if you have to...there are  many  in this song.

      I can't stay away from here today. Must be all the coffee I've been drinking. Or perhaps it has something to do with the unfortunate circumstance of having to work overtime. Either way, it would appear to be your lucky day. Or not. I'm really just trying to sound like I'm important; I'm not. Cool. Yes, maybe. Important. I doubt it.  Anyway, I've moved on to listening to  urlLink The Transplants ,  urlLink Diamonds and Guns . Hell, there is nothing like Tim Armstrong rapping. You gotta love it. (This link took a while to download, just to let you know. Be patient, it will work)       ::Diamonds and Guns::  Bombs goin off in Sierra Leone Taken more shots than Karl Malone Battle looms, your doom, injustice entombed Who got the diamonds? Who gonna find them? Who gonna mine them when the time comes? Diamonds and Guns, Diamonds and Guns  it's a wicked world that we live in it's cruel and unforgiving it's a wicked world that we live in it's cruel and unforgiving  Knock, knock, knock, who's that? It's Momma, son Lookin' for the bitch who took the money and run Now the daylight's gone and there's no more fun And who's the fuckin' bitch who stole all the heroin? Heroin, heroin, it's all gone Smoked it all up, and now you got none And now you look around and that's not the plan This is not what you had in mind  I shot in heaven, now I cry No one lives forever, in fact we all die From those who bust shots to those who stuff cops To those who serve rocks on all the hard blocks  Every last soul must pay the last toll In the dice game of life, who gets the last roll? Is it the one with the suit? The one with the sack? The one who hides behind his fuckin' gun and his badge? Negative outlook? Well that's how I'm livin' And like he said, it's a wicked world we live in  It's a wicked world we live in  I'm wiggin out, flippin' out, hearts is what I'm rippin' out I'm slippin' out, I'm dippin' out, killin's what I'm livin' out Pick 'em, let me pick 'em out, spin and let me whip it out Gat to your face with the fuckin' bullets stickin' out Missin' out, diss and bout, blood's what you're pissin' out 84 I'm Crazy Horse, shootin' up, I'm illin' out Rippin' out, I'm trippin' out, different now, I'm pimpin' out any color at my belt and ouch while they're clippin out Criminal I'm hittin' out, in L.A. no gettin' out 2-1-3, pack your P, fly wicked style Listen now, I'm sinnin' out, a 6-pack I'm sippin' out

      New Rule: You can make fun of Lynndie England all you want, but when it comes to prisons, we are all holding the leash.   Now this week, America's anti-Sweetheart, Private Lynndie England, faced justice for her part in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. Or as Rush Limbaugh calls it, "The Sleepover." Now, a lot of people think Abu Ghraib happened because, as Americans, we're comfortable asking our horny hillbillies to fight our wars. And we are. But we're also comfortable with pretending that anyone in America who winds up in prison for whatever reason somehow deserves not just loss of freedom but a brutalizing, terrifying trip to hell.   It's no coincidence that the guard described as the ringleader in Iraq, Charles Graner, worked before the war - where? - in a prison in America. He didn't learn to torture from the CIA or Special Ops. He picked it up right here and took his skills of abuse to Iraq.  Outsourcing at its worst!   Now, we are all Lynndie England because we know what's happening in our prisons and we don't care. We tell ourselves the convenient lie that anyone who bears the label "criminal" or "terrorist" is irredeemable, sub-human, psycho scum, and so whatever happens to them behind bars is justified. When the truth is, millions of non-violent Americans have been traumatized for life in prisons simply because they either did drugs or made a bad judgment, usually when they were young, stupid and drunk. You'd think President Bush could relate.   There are over two million Americans behind bars, and that is not including the people who work at Wal-Mart. America, the nation that always has to be number one, is number one in percentage of its citizens in jail. Two million people. The equivalent of locking up all of Miami, which is not a bad idea until at least the election is over.   It costs $40 billion to house this many prisoners. Do you know how many countries that had nothing to do with 9/11 we could attack for that kind of money?   So, in conclusion, if your response to this is "not my problem," remember this: there are monsters and animals in our prisons, yes. But most didn't go in that way. But that's how they'll come out. Or to put it another way, if you think Martha Stewart has an attitude now...

      There was a report in the, "Washington Times on Wednesday that a tape from bin Laden may surface soon that would act as a signal for planned attacks to be launched."   The newspaper, citing U.S. intelligence officials, said al-Qaida would target an American or foreign leader either within the United States or abroad.   Let me repeat the key words for you.  Target an  American  OR  foreign leader  EITHER within the  United States  OR  abroad .  Well. That clarifies a lot, doesn't it. Could we be anymore vague? Hasn't this  been  the threat?   I do believe so.  At first, I thought this broad generalization was simply the result of dim witted local  urlLink newscasters .   I kept waiting for the interviewer to cut off the anchor man and ask "In your dreams, do the skeletal dead ever push through the dirt and claw at your shins, their fleshless faces leering in glee and pain?"  Perhaps that happened in the last half.   But, alas, I've come to discover this awesome dialogue came straight from the award winning journalism of this country's  urlLink  national  news leaders.  Great reporting, guys. Just great.

      Medved had on his show a fellow who wants people to make new sex partners promise not to vote for Bush in exchange for hot monkey love. Or something like that. He insists that this is just a means of “starting the conversation,” which I hear from artists all the time. As if we’re all just standing here making mute gestures and shrugging, unable to discuss something unless the idea is put forth in Handy Art Form. He also wanted to "remind us of the connection between politics and sex," which officially made him the most dreary fellow I’d heard so far this week. These people always want to remind us of the connection between politics and everything. Politics and hot dogs. (Work conditions in the slaughterhouse!) Politics and lawn mowers. (Illegals keep our grass short!) Politics and Smurf fetishes. Politics and nose picking. It all goes back to that phrase I hated the first time I heard it -  the personal is the political . No, the personal is the  personal . I remember sitting in a theatre arguing with someone about the political implications of Mozart – he made music for the ruling class, ergo you had to see it in the context of 18th century Esterhazy intrigue, etc. etc. What an impoverished view of the world. These people can’t play "Chopsticks" on the piano without worrying whether they’re feeding into some Yellow Peril stereotype from the gilded age. Hey! It’s a pentatonic tune! Chinese music is pentatonic! Chinese culture uses chopsticks! It’s OKAY!

      Because, here I am rocking out to Alkaline Trio at work, and I thought to myself that I must share some of this Alkaline love. However, the song I wanted to share, is somewhat old, so I thought it would be impossible to find, especially in the limited time that I have. In fact, I thought that there is no way in hell, that I'm going to find the song, Private Eye, on MP3, to link here.   But I did!  Really, you have no idea how excited I am. Heh. Obviously, it doesn't take much to make me happy.  Enjoy,  urlLink Private Eye , by  urlLink Alkaline Trio .       ::PRIVATE EYE::  I dragged this lake looking for corpses Dusted for prints, pried up the floorboards Pieces of planes and black box recorders Don't lie  And I've been preoccupied with these sick, sick senses That sense DNA on barbed wire fences Maybe someday I'll find me a suspect That has no alibi  New Year's Eve was as boring as heaven I watched flies fuck on channel 11 There was no one to kiss, there was nothing to drink Except some old rotten milk someone left in the sink  And there's no ring on the phone anymore  There's no reason to call I passed out on the floor Smoked myself stupid and drank my insides raisin dry    But at the right place at the right time I'll be dead wrong and you'll be just fine And I won't have to quit doing fucked up shit For anyone but me   And at the right place at the right time It will have been worth it to stand in line And you won't have to stop Saying "I love cops" for anyone but me Your private eye

      This blog seems to be endlessly changing. And I'm thinking this is a good thing. It's growing, expanding, and hopefully opening your eyes to new and different things. Or, at the very least, reminding you of things that you already love.   Last week I introduced the "New Rules," which ,by the way, will be posted either later today or tomorrow, and now I'm announcing that Scars Of Tomorrow, will indeed incorporate music at an entirely new level. This should not come as a big surprise. I've already left hints here and there that music is one, if not the most, important thing in my life. I simply could not live with out it. I'm not going to get carried away right now on my musical taste, except to say, I love almost all types. I'm sure you all already know punk is my favorite, so that is mostly likely what I will be linking. However, don't be utterly surprised if some hip-hop gets thrown in here. It's not all bad, I promise you.  Anyway, I'm not quite sure how I'm going to work out all the little details, but I'm not really worried about it. Most likely, when a song catches my fancy, I'll find a MP3 link, the lyrics, and then share it with you. I think this sounds pretty damn fun. So. Let's get this party started.  Ladies and Gents - it's time to put some pussy in your punk!  Today's song is  urlLink Take The Reins  by the punk band,  urlLink Tsunami Bomb .   I also happen to know them, and got to hang out with them during the 2003 Warped Tour. I know, I know. I'm so freakin' cool, eh?  Winks.      I was just listening to this song earlier, and I had an overwhelming desire to share. And would you look at that … birth to a new blogging category.  Here are the lyrics. And have fun.    ::Take The Reins::   18, you think you're free To be what you wanna be Have a job or 2 or 3, you'll say you're sorry Don't try to run or fight Ask how or when or why Who cares what's wrong or right? It's money that matters  Each day just like the next We struggle on and on In nightmares but we're still marching Handcuffed to life again Don't try, they'll only push you down What's opportunity? You've got what you wanted now  How long till I'm my own? Independence doesn't start when you leave home   Locked in, can't get out Your cube is your new home 4 walls, no windows, no doors Hancuffed to life again Don't try, they'll only push you down  What's opportunity? You've got what you wanted now!      UPDATE:  Brought to you by   urlLink www.purevolume.com . Go ahead and listen to their other songs since you're there! Don't be afraid.

        Now it's morning but last night's on my mind. And there's something I need to get off my chest. And no matter what may come to shine, The dream will always be mine.    I've decided to link a few MP3's, of one of my favorite bands, 311.  I've been a fan for over ten years (damn. That makes me feel old.) And I've had the honor of meeting them, drinking beer with them, and being in their music video,  urlLink Creatures for awhile .  I'd like to dedicate the song  urlLink All Mixed Up , to an unusual person, who makes me feel kind of ... unusual.   Enjoy.    Trapped in a material plane,  she wants to fly and they think she's insane. But she knows what she knows, give that girl wings and that's all that she wrote.

      This  urlLink shit  is really beginning to freak me out.   You know, it's not like I don't have anything better to worry about. Dying by mosquito bite, should  not  be one of them!   James Damiano, 57, of Fullerton, was identified as California's first victim of West Nile. He died on June 24.   I LIVE in Fullerton!!  There is more then one thing wrong with this picture, eh?!  I need to move. Any suggestions?

      It's going to be over 100 degrees today. This weather is ungodly, and quite frankly, I hate it. This heat makes me all crazy like. And not in a good way.  Everything I do is all rather indistinct. The brain, she has shut down.   Maybe later I'll write more. In the meantime, enjoy a song by Bananarama, that I find to be quite fitting.   You guessed right, it's  urlLink cruel summer .

      How sad and this is what your life has been reduced to - a single room apartment containing no more than a mattress. How sad, when the strings have been removed from the blinds and all the outlets have been painted over. And the television screen is streaked with blood and smeared from your knuckles, as if you were trying to punch it out but you underestimated the strength. Or maybe you just weren't trying hard enough. Startled by a knock at the door, you'll rise for the first time in two days to answer. But you can only greet the visitor with one short statement  -  Hello. My first name is Distance and I really don't care if I never wake up again.
