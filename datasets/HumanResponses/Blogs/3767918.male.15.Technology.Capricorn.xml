      Hi folks, today I create my first blog. I'd never thought of making a blog before, I made this one just to get a Gmail account :P but hopefully it will be fun.   What I've Been Doing:   Well yesterday was my girlfriend's birthday and she came over for the whole day - most of which we spent naked ;) I bought her a necklace, a union jack thong (that she asked for and looks great in :D), a rose and, using the Far Cry engine, I made her a map - a collection of desert island that spelt out "Simon [heart] Kirsty". She loved it all and I got a very... nice thankyou ;) Oh, and I made her a cake and dinner too.  I had maths homework to do, but I've forgotten how to do most of it, so whether I will get round to it is questionable.   What I've Been Playing:   I've been playing Hitman Contracts on PC the last couple of days and I'm liking it. I seem to resort to violece a bit too much for the genre but its fun and that's what counts.   In the News:   According to Chinese state media, dozens of drug dealers have been sentenced to death. Not because China is that tough on drugs/barbaric, but to celebrate International Anti-Drugs Day! How quaint...  Michael Moore's new film, Faranheit 9/11, has made $8 million on the first day. I'm quite looking forward to seeing this film [expect my opinions on it soon] but I fear most people will see it because it's the thing to do, and not really watch the film the way it should be watched.   Other Stuff:   All should be on the look out for a new worm being spread by popular websites. The code exploits a hole in Internet Explorer and redirects you to a Russian site that tries to install the code. To check if you are infected:  Click the Start button and then click on Search   Make sure you choose the option to look through all files and folders   Search for files called Kk32.dll and Surf.dat   If infected use up to date anti-virus software to remove malicous code  That's all for now, see you... whenever.  cvx  Thought of the Post: Is mockery a form of ignorance or a form of enlightenment?

      Hey ho. Back from school, felt like a very long day and I'm uber tired so I must get to bed early tonight. Unfortunately this means I will have more homework to do tomorrow which means I won't be able to play Planetside until Wednesday which I really need to [see  What I've Been Playing ]   What I've Been Doing:   School today. My English teacher tells me that she forgot to right on my coursework draft that I had to put in a load of stuff on camera angles (media piece on Bowling for Columbine) so I have English coursework to do :( I also have to revise for my maths exam on Wednesday and do loads of science homework for then. Not... cool...   What I've Been Playing:   Hitman Contracts last night, got quite far and got another 'Silent assassin' rating so all is well. Also, I have been up for a promotion to Legion Officer in my Planetside outfit the Renegade Legion. This, the second highest rank available would be totally awesome but I have little time to play right now. I was hoping to get a to of commanding done this week but I may not have time :(   In the News:   Two days ahead of schedule, the US have handed power back to the new Iraqi government and Prime Minister Iyad Allawi. The bringing forward of the hand over was probably to prevent any large scale terror attacks that may have been planned to mark the occasion.  At the NATO summit in Istanbul this week, the 26 NATO states have agreed to offer training to Iraq's new Security forces. Hopefully this will see Coalition troops leave Iraq sooner as their own forces can take more of the weight.  Also at the summit, police clashed with protestors - protesting about pretty much everything - and used water cannons, batons and tear gas to disperse the crowd.  To fight of Google.com's Gmail service, currently in the beta testing stage, Hotmail are boosting the free email storage size to 250MB. This however is still far short of Gmail's 1GB.   Other Stuff:   I've decided to request an increase in my allowance. I currently get a meager Â£5 a week which I can't live on. Â£10 or Â£15 would be much fairier I feel and bring me inline with my friends. Whether I get it is questionable... Was hoping to take Kirsty's cake round today so I could see her, if only for a few minutes but my family ate it all :( So I won't see her until Saturday evening which pisses me off because I miss her soooooo much!  cvx  Thought of the Post: If one experienced everything it is possible to experience, would they still have desire?

      Hi folks. I am currently sitting in a business studies IT lesson. I'm rather annoyed because Lizzie wanted to stay the weekend in Bournemouth with me Kirsty and Courtney, but my parents (for the first time in years) refused to let me. So I'll only be going for the day - sometime in the summer.  I can't see Kirsty until Saturday which is annoying and it will only be in the evening. She's going shopping with her birthday money and Lizzie won't let me come because her boyfriend Courtney can't come and they were meant to be fucking all day but Kirsty dragged her along lol.  So I've got this week free. I'll probably go into town with some people and spend as much time as possible sleeping - I've been very tired recently.  Also, I've got sports day on Thursday which sucks arse. Hopefully I won't be doing anything though.  My mates Ben and Vicki broke up over the weekend. They had been going out for at least a year I think so that's a real blow. Apparently he just stopped fancying her...  But I think he still does. I think, after a certain period of time, the awe of how beautiful someone is just wears off and you kind of take it for granted how amazing they look. I'm not sure how involved the were sexually, but maybe it just got boring. I mean, if you do the same thing day after day it must just get boring and you stop looking forward to it and it seems like you don't fancy the person anymore.  cvx  Thought of the Post: How can women understand those weird whispering sounds they make to each other?!

      Sooooo tired... I very nearly fell asleep in science but was prevented by the uncomfortable chairs.  I need sleep but I never seem to get to bed early...  What I've Been Doing:  School and being very tired and missing Kirsty an unbelievable amount. Hopefully I won't be in sports day - my team captain says he won't put me in unless he has to, so fingers crossed.  Episode 37 of Red vs Blue came out last night. Best one in a while. Quite long and lots of story too.  Kirsty is depressed :( She's got lots of coursework to do, can't see me all week and might not be able to go on a boat trip she's been wanting to go on for ages. If she can't go then I'll have to do something really nice for her (dunno what lol) and I'll try to make Saturday as nice as possible (next time I see her).  In the News:  Saddam Hussein is set to be handed over to the Iraqi authorities. He will be held in Iraqi cusotdy and tried by an Iraqi court for various crimes.  Militants in Iraq have released three Turkish men after they promised not to work for America again. It seems the militants are trying to keep in Arab nations' good books by letting Muslims go free whenever possible.  A woman has, for the first time, successfully conceived a child after having an ovary transplant.  A bodged terrorist attack resulted in the injury of three Turkish cleaners... A booby trapped bomb planted on board a plane exploded AFTER passengers had left the plane, injuring three cleaners.  Other Stuff:  Grrr... Still no email about Gmail. I need a new email address sharpish...  My mother laughed at the suggest of an allowance increase so I shall procure the money from my Grandmother's will every week. Tis my money anyway.  Apparently I am not allowed to use the phone upstairs anymore... Looks like my parents are trying to enforce rules again. I'm not having that. I shall continue to use it upstairs but I will now strive to phone mobiles instead of landlines and use it off-peak. Mwuhahaha. Also I haven't spoken to my friends in Denmark and the US in a while... I think a very long phone call to each one is in order...

      What I've Been Doing:  Maths exam today. Was fine, very easy apart from one question which I didn't have a clue about.  What I've Been Playing:  Just about to play Planetside. We're having a King of the Hill tournament which should be fun.  In the News:  A tube strike proposed by the RMT has gone ahead today causing widespread disruption in London.   Two militants and one policeman have been killed in gun battles in the capital of Saudi Arabia - Riyadh.  A new system is being trialled in the UK to stop plagiarism in universities. The software will search for blogs of text or entire essays lifted from websites. It seems unlikely that it will be able to detect altered text e.g.  "America and the USSR were the main rivals during the cold war."  changed to  "Russia was the main rival of America during the cold war."  However, it should prevent simple "copy & paste essays".  Other Stuff:  Sports day tomorrow... It might rain but otherwise, its quite likely I'll be running the relay :( oh well.  Now I'm off to play Planetside :)

      What I've Been Doing:  Twas sports day today. I thought it was going to be rained off, but it wasn't. Luckily all my team turned up and were healthy so I didn't have to run :D Watched a film in English which was ok. Going to be playing Planetside tonight hopefully. I'll get some screenshots to make a better signature for Vasquez (my character's name).  What I've Been Playing:  Planetside. Lead a platoon last night. We resecured Amerish after a few hours and I got a few Command Experience Points. We were going to play a king of the hill game at a tower on the test server but it was just crap so we didn't bother.  In the News:  Saddam Hussein had his first court appearance today. He mocked the court and said he was still president. He refused to sign his legal papers and called the court a "theatre".  Construction of the barrier the Israeli military is constructing on the West Bank has been halted by an Israeli court. They say although the wall is legal, some sections cause too much disruption to the lives of Palestinians and must be re-routed.  Other Stuff:  Sony are working on a new Walkman model. It'll be a digital music player (an MP3 player that...Dosn't play... MP3s... lol, all will be explained) instead of an antique tape player. It is set to be Â£55 cheaper and with considerably more space than the top iPod model (which it is settot rival). However, there is a catch. It will only play music in sony's own special format - so u have to buy your music digitally from the sonyonlinee music store. However I'm sure some genius will make a program to convert MP3s to theSonyy format.  Can't wait until Saturday when I can see Kirsty!

      What I've Been Doing:  Pretty average day at school on Friday. Saw Kirsty today :D haven't seen her for a week. She went shopping and blew her birthday money, then we went back to hers. Went on her new (huge) trampoline and... Other stuff ;)  What I've Been Playing:  Been leading platoons on Planetside, getting some CEP but not much :( good fun though :)  In the News:  I forgot to read the papers/websites/watch the news on Friday, so you'll just have to make something up for yourself.  Brazil has passed a law banning the carrying of firearms in public and making it illegal to own an unlicensed gun - with licensing rules similar to those in the UK. There is also to be a referendum to on whether to ban guns outright.  A car containing four Rumanians and bearing German number plates, has crashed into the security fence at the Houses of parliament. Two men have been arrested and police are trying to determine if the crash was deliberate or not.  Other Stuff:  Microsoft have upgraded their search engine to come close to the quality of commercial search engines like Google. They are also planning to release their own search engine software later this year.  The Hubble telescope has discovered around one hundred new planets orbiting distant stars. This makes the total of known planets to two hundred and thirty.
