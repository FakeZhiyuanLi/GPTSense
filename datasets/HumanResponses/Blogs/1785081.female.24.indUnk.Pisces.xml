						   She told me today not to try... not to beg... that to beg and be denied hurts too much... that she wouldn't want to put me through that... so all of this hope has fled... all of it is lost... the life I wanted is truly gone forever... so quit the hoping, quit the memories from coming... quit the pain from filling every moment... even dying for her wouldn't be enough... nothing would be enough... she's through.&nbsp;   And without that hope, I don't want to live anymore.&nbsp; I don't want this anymore.&nbsp; I'm through too... with everything.

						   I wonder how long it will be before I can wake up without thinking of her, without wondering where she is, or if she's thinking of me?&nbsp; How long will it be before I no longer wake up to shattered memories of us together, like small slivers of a mirror, reflecting the good of what will never be again.&nbsp; Like little shards of glass, every little one brings a different and new pain... embedded in my skin.&nbsp; When will I wake up without the heavy weight of regret on my shoulders, without the wish to cry, without the wish to disappear?&nbsp; When will she stop showing up in my dreams, haunting me even as I sleep?&nbsp; When will I stop thinking of her, dreaming of her, trying to find ways to win her back? When will it be over?&nbsp; Or is this just the way it goes on forever?&nbsp; Maybe if it had been a terrible relationship this would have been easier... if she had been cruel to me, unkind... but that wasn't true.&nbsp; I was the cruel one, I think... I gave up the relationship... that's why I'm sure she sleeps peacefully at night, and never thinks of me... she swept up the shards of glass and threw it all out... erased me completely.&nbsp; How do I do the same, knowing that I was the one that caused so much pain?&nbsp; That I made the mistake?&nbsp; This guilt overwhelms... that I hurt such a precious soul.&nbsp;   I think we weren't meant to be... but that doesn't help.&nbsp; We could have been... if I hadn't been a moron.&nbsp; If I hadn't gotten lonely... we could have been.&nbsp; She is so much happier without me now.... but even this doesn't stop me from wishing... doesn't stop me from loving her... doesn't stop the memories from assaulting me as soon as I wake up in the morning.  I've been working to transfer all of this pain and energy into something good... instead of wasting it in mindless depression... like my friend told me, I'm trying to put it all into loving my g/f... because she deserves&nbsp; better than what I've been able to give... she deserves better than some woman who pines for her former life... so all of this has to end.&nbsp; The pain of memory has to blend in with the other pains... until i don't feel it quite as sharply anymore... until I can live with it... and live with myself for what I've done.

						   A friend told me yesterday that I need to quit dwelling and spend all this time, passion, and energy on loving my g/f... instead of mourning the old... It makes sense.&nbsp; Trying to displace the emotion is harder than I thought... but from some reason the words stuck with me.&nbsp; Why should I dwell on something that happened, something that brought me so much pain, something I have already learned from, re-considered, cried about and in which I slump through my days like a zombie for?&nbsp; There's no reason for me to carry on like this, like a damned dead woman.&nbsp; Supposedly I have so much more to focus on but that really doesn't help at the&nbsp;moment... I need something else.&nbsp; I need to figure out how to heal. I need to figure out why what happened is so excruciating to think&nbsp;about... and why do I fear feeling all of&nbsp;that emotion?&nbsp; Why do I stuff it back inside?&nbsp; There's no "later" in which to express it... no time to grieve.&nbsp; No time at work... and at home I don't feel it.&nbsp; Only in the mornings, when I'm alone... when I'm driving to work... when I'm sitting at my desk... I feel it then.&nbsp; And I'm becoming nearly desperate to get rid of it... get it OUT... I just don't know how.&nbsp; I can't deal with emotions like this.&nbsp; I don't know how to express them, how to feel them... how to let them go.&nbsp;   It all seems to be centered on this main issue: I waited four years for&nbsp;her to fall in love with&nbsp;me, and when she finally did I had already moved on... to something I&nbsp;thought was "better"...I left her out in the cold when she came back from deployment... tried&nbsp;not to see her or talk to her because I feared the anger of my new&nbsp;woman... instead of being "better"... instead&nbsp;of being&nbsp;what i had missed...&nbsp;the new woman&nbsp;just became frustrated with me and nearly gave up.. she withdrew and hurt me...took back all of the things she had said before... and I&nbsp;began to think of Marta again... and when i checked at last,&nbsp;Marta had already fallen in love with a new girl... and was incredibly happy.&nbsp; Happier than she had ever been with me.&nbsp; I could hear it in her voice...&nbsp;  So that's the painful part... when&nbsp;she had finally loved me completely I had given up on her... and when I wanted to patch things up she had already erased me from her life... as easy as erasing chalk from the board.&nbsp; And now, with no contact, it's as if we never existed... the only reason I know&nbsp;I was ever with her is through the pictures left behind...   So i screwed up... I made the mistake... I caused everything that I&nbsp;am feeling right now... and there seems to be no way to resolve this.&nbsp; There is nothing I can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;She's gone forever and I will never see her again... what was will never be again... and I have to process that... figure out what to do with allof this self-hatred and hurt.&nbsp;   My next try: to displace the energy I put into mourning... and give it to one who deserves it... if I can get her attention this weekend for a few minutes... &nbsp;   &nbsp;

						   Rough morning... criticized by my co-workers for being grumpy day in and day out... but they don't know what I've been through in the past year.&nbsp; Literally since January everything has changed for me.&nbsp; All future plans erased.&nbsp; Love lost.&nbsp; Cats missing.&nbsp; My first auto accident... and my first two traffic citations.&nbsp; A different life is struggling to emerge but I'm not sure if it is motivated by positive thinking, or simply constructed from negative thoughts alone.&nbsp; I think fear plays a role, though not all-encompassing.&nbsp; Fear certainly motivates my wish for escapism... to just run away, curl into a dark hole and be left for dead.&nbsp; But fear also keeps me from doing just that. A tiny spark of life within me still exists, that won't be diminished by circumstances... but why is it that I can't get past this?&nbsp; That it haunts me every day and every night?&nbsp; I'm starting to get insomnia again... my mind races late at night, the tears try to come... I stuff it all down because there is no time or place to grieve, no time to feel this way... that I shoudl be looking forward and not back... and this perhaps emerges from the the shame affect I discussed earlier.&nbsp; I've managed to figure out that the inability to express emotion in my house became a source of shame... told not to cry, or get anrgy, or feel sad certainly left more of a mark than I thought... not that that is entirely to blame.&nbsp; Fear also comes in here - I'm afraid to FEEL because the pain is so overwhelming... and I can't seem to let it go.&nbsp; It lingers... rears up within me whenever I have a moment to think too much.&nbsp; It confuses me, derails my train of thought... and causes minor heart-attack symptoms.&nbsp; I wishit would end.&nbsp; I wish I couldn't feel it anymore... I wish I didn't think of her anymore... I wish I could let go of the shame, let criticism roll off of me, realize that I have much more to feel for in this world than grief.&nbsp; I just can't seem to let anything else in... the sadness is so pervasive... and it feels as if nothing can be done about it.&nbsp; I can't talk to anyone about it.&nbsp; I can't discuss it without feeling that overwhelming despair... and I can't forgive myself for what happened.&nbsp; I'm at a loss.&nbsp; I don't know what to do anymore.&nbsp; I just move through my days hoping something will snap me out of this long enough that i can smile, long enough that i can feel something other than sadness.&nbsp; I hope each day for something to lift my spirits... something to tell me that I can move on again... that it's time to let go.&nbsp; That she's gone.&nbsp; Forever.&nbsp; But the optimism battles the negativity and loses most of the time.&nbsp; My everyday expression is a frown, and I don't know what to do anymore to change that... because I want to feel happiness again... I want to feel my g/f loving me... I want to look forward to each new day... I want to be fully human again.

						   I've been pondering this question this morning.&nbsp; My g/f and I were discussing the past (namely, her ex-g/f), and I was wondering why we focus so much on it... I guess we attempt to use what we can from our experiences... those of us with a conscience (and maybe an overwhelming or at least pervasive shame affect) try to learn something from our mistakes.&nbsp; The problem with me is that every mistake I make seems to linger, and I don't learn from them at all - I just ingest them as inherent flaws within me. I seem to make the same mistakes over and over... and some have turned out alright... others not so well.&nbsp; The worst regrets are those that have hurt others... for those I can never forgive myself.&nbsp;

						   Frankie said something very interesting in her blog, which I encourage people to read.&nbsp; In her very first post she mentions the role that love has played for her in her life and how it has evolved: Life isn't love and love isn't life.&nbsp; Amazingly insightful.&nbsp; I thin the mountain air has done her some good.&nbsp; There is love in so many things other than our partners.&nbsp; I lost sightof that a little with Marta... I truly did live just for her, just to be near her.&nbsp; I kept going to school, of course... but all other plans were laid with her in my mind.&nbsp; I thought she was my "forever".&nbsp; And I was content for a long time.&nbsp; I think as time passed, as she grew further away from her, taking her own life in her hands.. often without me... I realized I was lacking something as a human... a singular motivation and self-love.&nbsp; I had no reason to live other than for her... and as she withdrew, when I sw her interact with friends, when i saw the life I wasn't a part of, I grew resentful.&nbsp; There are so many things I want but I can't seem able to get, no matter how hard I try.&nbsp; It's easier to ignore my shortcomings and fill them with someone else's presence than to face them down, and fill the voids on my own.&nbsp; My therapist asked me once to describe myself... my interests... and what i valued about myself... and there was a long, doubting silence.&nbsp; I could think of less than a handful of things that were positive aspects...  &nbsp; I think this also explains why I become so jealous when my g/f discusses her ex's... or talks to them on the phone... or receives email from them.&nbsp; I'm not insecure about losing her - I'm just jealous of this whole life that she has led... the things she's done, the places she's been.&nbsp; Every day I wonder if I'm living at all... or just going through the motions... it's very disconcerting to not know.&nbsp;  &nbsp; But then I focus on the things that bring me small joys: sunsets, pets curled up asleep on my lap, that first sip of coffee in the morning, autumn leaves in the wind... there are many small loves in this world, and they are enough to sustain us without the big "L" capital/italics.&nbsp; There is the love we feel for others, too.&nbsp; I thought that I had repaired my emptiness in the last year... since Marta has been gone... but it lingered far longer than expected.&nbsp; I wasn't able to fill the voids.&nbsp; I feel now, however, more aware of my emotions, my responses, my self-worth and values... I think I can fill myself up, as a whole person, without latching onto someone again.&nbsp; None of us "need" someone else to be whole... we just think we do.&nbsp;

						   A friend of mine started her own blog, and I'd like to post it on mine but I'm still recalling html code... the templates provided are fairly easy to navigate but for some reason I can't get her link to show up on the page.&nbsp; So Frankie, I'll post it here for now:  urlLink Frankie's Blog .&nbsp; Frankie is a friend from NC who fled to Wyoming following love and the hope for a new and different life.&nbsp; I wish her the best of luck.&nbsp; I think she's happier than she's ever been right now.&nbsp;  &nbsp; It's Monday morning and I'm still at home.&nbsp; I took the day off, for which I feel abnormally guilty... however it's been awhile since I've had a day to myself.&nbsp; Plenty to do, of course... still retrieving items from the old apartment and doing some cleaning while I'm there... pick up my baby's Class A's while she's at work... and I was considering putting them together for her while she's gone... surprise her when she drags in at about 6, exhausted from another long Monday.&nbsp; I'd also like to put together her closet - I love to surprise her because she expects so little from her girlfriends.&nbsp; And I want to be the best... make sure she's happy.&nbsp; She deserves everything I have to offer. &nbsp; 9:20 and I probably should get started.&nbsp; I was hoping to sleep in today but I got woken up by an energetic woman jumping on the bed at 7:20 am... that PT does wonders for a tired soul.&nbsp; :-) &nbsp;

						    "If distress is the affect of suffering, shame is the affect of indignity, transgression and alienation.&nbsp; Though terror speaks to life and death and distress makes of the world a vale of tears, yet shame strikes deepest into the heart of man... shame is felt as inner torment, a sickness of the soul... the humiliated one feels himself naked, defeated, alienated, lacking in dignity and worth." (Tonkins, 1992)     &nbsp;  I've been doing some brief research into the Nine Aspects of the human psyche, as termed by most psychotherapists.&nbsp; It is interesting to me that shame, only one of nine, is the most powerful of all of them.&nbsp; Shame has the power to over-ride all other emotions - downplaying anger or even joy.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Shame is a part of guilt, but runs much deeper.&nbsp; Guilt, for example, is the acknowledgement that "I was wrong in this circumstance" and is usually followed by attempting reconciliation.&nbsp; Shame, however, is internalized and is heard instead as "I am wrong".&nbsp; Healing shame is much more difficult than getting over guilt.&nbsp; I've found myself suspiciouly conscious of my own inner shame recently... that this affect within me has nearly become a monster in my soul, completely out of control.&nbsp; I'm a textbook case of someone suffering frm immense personal shame - I not only have emotional luggage, apparently I have an entire cargo plane full of shame.&nbsp; The final trigger, that overwhelmed all other emotions, was the event with Marta.&nbsp; For all of that my shame deepened, and I realized that I blamed myself for all of it - not only blamed myself but considered myself an evil person, unworthy, and further, unlovable whatsoever.&nbsp; Now what happened with Marta can be forgiven - should be forgiven as a ntural human mistake, just like everyone makes... but I made it into the defining moment of absolute self-hatred.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Shame is an innate affect, like the other eight.&nbsp; How we process our affects is effected by our up-bringing... so where did I learn to internalize shame?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Some excellent websites that describe the affects better than I:   urlLink Shame and Psychotherapy    urlLink The Affect Scale

						   For those of you who have followed my blogs you'll notice that the basis of them have always been my significant others: i.e. "While You're Gone" and "The Falling Leaf" were notably about my ex-girlfriend.  I've finally realized that perhaps a blog solely about me and my little world might benefit me more than lamenting the sorrows of what feel like past lives.  It's time to re-organize my brain to recognize that in this tiny world I live in, I am an important element... and that there is meaning in everything we do and in everything that happens to us.  I'm not saying that there will not be the occassional depressing posts - we all have our rainy mondays - but I'm hoping this will be a more positive outlook, based on ME instead of HER.  Welcome.

						     You left without saying goodbye     although maybe you tried     You never did look back     all those times before     and maybe I deserved it     I broke your heart     now you're breaking mine     you survived to love again     I don't think I'll survive     You always came back     in the past     this time you won't     This time you don't love me     This time I do     This time I think of you     each and every day     a hundred times of your smile     a hundred times of your embrace     a thousand times of your kiss     a million times of you     I thought I knew what I wanted     and I ended everything      I caused all of this pain     all I want is to reverse this     go back to the time when I was happy     go back to when I could tell you     STAY.

						   So she decided not to respond to my last email message... so then, that's it, right?  The promise for communication is broken... I'm not even worth her time anymore.  So... she has really moved on.  She won't be coming back this time.  And she is nailing me for every hurt I ever perpetrated on her... everything I ever did is coming back to me threefold in this pain... this weight that I carry everywhere.  I would have given the world not to have had to get out of bed this morning.  My job is meaningless, worthless... I'm not even interested in schoolwork like I used to be.  No motivation whatsoever.  I did it all for her, i'm realizing... not for myself.  I was working here so that we could be together down here... I was working on my BA so that we would have somewhere to go when her army years were over... I have been looking forward to not being associated with the army for four years now... I guess I failed on that.  I failed her and now I'm failign myself.  I can't get out of this gutter I'm in.  I still want everything to be the way it was before... when I was happy... when the world made sense, had meaning, had love and vitality... back to a sort of innocence, I guess.  Do others go through this?  This loss of everything?  How do they survive?   It stuns me that I'm actually looking forward to going to the dentist tomorrow... i'd rather be there than here... and that means there really must be something wrong with me.  MK... I'm sorry for everything... I wish that this one time you had come back... you always cam eback before... I wasn't expecting this now... and it hurts.  I hope you're happy.

						   I had an interesting epiphany this morning... I was thinking about the Shame Affect i discussed earlier... and how I project the shame I hold within.  It occurred to me that I only see myself as a stage manager... for example, in highschool I was a stage manager for a dozen or more plays.  Techies like myself never receive very much respect, and we never stand in the spotlight and receive the applause for a job well done.  At most, we get a moment's recognition from the cast.  However, we orchestrate the entire production - they only do well because we did our jobs expertly.  I think I've carried on this idea into my adult life - the idea that I'm only a stage manager, that I am only here to support someone else, to help them and watch them in the spotlight... from the shadows of stage right.  Am I content to do this?  Sometimes.  I did it for Marta for years... and I find myself falling into the same mindset with the current g/f.  I am only at this job to help support myself... there is nothing here for me, nowhere to grow, nothing interesting within it.  I'm only here for a paycheck, and so that I can go home and be with someone.  I manage the little things so that she can handle all of the big things... she has a life, a belief in herself and meaning in her life... and i watch from the sidelines and sweep up the excess.  I orchestrate what I can behnd the scenes and stand back as an "extra".  I have learned, somehow, that the only meaning in my life is to live for someone else... I don't really exist at all.   I've seen women do this - attach meanings to themselves that only center around their significant others... and I never thought it would be me... never realized that that WAS me... so how do I find my own meaning?  How do I step out of stage management and get into the spotlight... and if I do, will I hear applause or only boos?  is that what frightens me?  Or am I afraid that I won't find any meaning...  I have learned that this sadness that dwells within me all the time, throughout my life - this well of emotion - is terror.  Pure terror.  How does that play into the idea that I have no meaning?

						   This Saturday my g/f brought home a shy little ball of gray and black fur - Nicki.  She bought me a cat - adopted from the no-kill shelter.  She said she felt bad that I had lost my other cat (Fiona ran away and never came back... I think from a broken heart).  Of course this brought me to tears... that she actually bought me a cat, knowing I missed having one around... knowing that having one in the house would aggravate her asthma.  And knowing that this little soul would be my companion in the long months of silence following her deployment.  I also cried because it reminded me of another deployment... where I spend day after day with only a feline companion... Marta's cat... crawling all over the bed... the similarity of the situations kills me if I think about it too much.  But this is not Marta... this is not the old house.. this is not the old situation.  I cried for all of these things because it's such a tangle of emotions inside of me... I don't know up from down sometimes.   I'm starting to worry about the deployment.  I think i depend on my g'f more than I should... I look forward to going home to her... I get through my days just because I know I'll see her at the end... and life shouldn't be like that... I can't go about this the way I did with Marta... I can't live FOR her... I have to live for myself..  that's easier said than done right now, however... for lack of a better illustration, I feel like an old ship out at sea... no sight of harbor... storm clouds are brewing... and my compass has been broken... my g/f shines like a lighthouse in the twilight.  I can't help but try to find safe harbor at her shores...
