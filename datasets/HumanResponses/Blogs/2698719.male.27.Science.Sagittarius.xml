      When I was Christmas shopping, I found this book called  1000 Places to See Before You Die . It's got a shitload of cool places to visit and things to do during our trip. I wonder how many of the 1000 we'll hit...

      After some investigation, I have decided that Blogger is the best free blogging service available.  All of the others either lack or make you pay for some key feature.  I'll just swallow my Yahoo! pride and use a google-owned service.  Hell, it might be good for me.  In fact, I may switch from Atkins to the pride-only diet.  In other news...we are getting pretty close to the 1 year until go mark.  It's time to stop my phaffing about and put some real work into this project.  Mike's goals for the months of June:  * Start program of inoculations * Find the right kind of travel insurance

      Those Typhoid Fever pills were pretty annoying. I had constant low-grade indigestion all week. My guts are still kinda sore.

      After a disquieting amount of tomfoolery, I finally managed to get access to le Blog.  I think this is an excellent format for keeping a record of our trip.  Pull media is the way to go.  Rather than spamming folks or sending the same thing out to a lot of people in a somewhat personalized format, better to let them come to us.  My only problem with this is that Blogger is owned by Google and I work for Yahoo and we hate those mofos.  To address my loyalty issue, we could maybe move this to another Blog provider or build something ourselves.  As usual, I'm leaning toward the latter, but I think I'll swallow my engineer pride this time and suggest the former.

      Vaccinations. Aw, yeah.  Thursday, I went to this place called The Healthy Traveler Clinic to check up on all of the innoculations I need to get for the trip. Steve (Mom's boyfriend) took a sailing trip around the Carribbean many years ago, and he advised me to look into the vaccinations way early. So, I went.  The doctor was a pretty cool guy, and we just talked about where I was planning on going, and what I was planning on doing. My answers were "the world", and "have unprotected sex with many prostitutes, while doing intravenous drugs through my cornea", respectively. Well, I lied about one of those. Anyway, I ended up getting some shots, which actually weren't that bad. The doc had this pinching trick that made the injection barely noticeable. I guess when you do nothing but inject people with shit all day long, you get pretty good at it.  The list: Hepatitus A (One more shot in 6 months.) Tetanus (my arm is still sore) Polio Yellow Fever Rabies (I have to do two more over the next coupla months.)  I'm also taking these pills to innoculate me against Typhoid Fever for 5 years. I need to take 4 pills over a week, and I can't drink no alcohol. Damnit. Plus, he gave me a month's worth of Malaria pills to try out once the Typhoid regimen is done. During the trip, I'll have to take them when I'm in malaria areas, so I'm trying them now to make sure there are no side effects.  The best part, though, was that all of this innoculation business isn't covered by my insurance. So, I had cough up $630. Sweet.

      Just returned from my last Layson-Family Hilton Head until 2007. Wow. That's a long time. I hope I can still keep in touch with the step-fam. I guess I'll be seeing a bunch of them at my sister's wedding party in Chicago (end of July). I'm thinking about getting cheap little machandranath.com business cards made so I can give them out to people who are interested in keeping track of our trip. Since we're going to be getting an influx of interested readers, I found and enabled the   Comments   functionality of the blog. Now, folks should be able to leave us messages on this here web log.  Oh. Lest I forget. While I was in Hilton Head, I was talking to my cousin Mike G about my future travels. Apparently, a friend of his was traveling in Vietnam a few years ago and came down with a case of the Japanese Encephalitus. Kicked his ass for weeks and damaged his brain enough to change his job title. Scary Stuff. Three cheers for innoculations. Maybe Mike G will read this and leave a more detailed comment about what happened to his Lurch-y friend.

      Well, I finished my rabies shots, and have a nice purple bruise to prove it. So, the only thing left to do on the disease front is to get a Hepatitus A booster and my Japanese Encephalitus innoculation. I need to make sure that my head won't leak blood and explode because of intimate contact with Asian pork & fowl. Oh, and I still have to try out the malaria pills (250mg Mefloquine). Lastly, I need to look up the definition of "phaffing".  ps... I filled out my profile. I think I'm one step closer to Londontown.

      More and more people are learning about our trip. I want to direct them to our website, but it's not really fair to expect people to remember website names. And, if it's people I just met, I don't have their email address, blah, blah, blah... &nbsp; Anyway, I just figured it would be easier to get some "business" cards made, so I can just hand them out to people who are interested. I found a cool&nbsp;website where you can do this stuff online:  urlLink vistaprint.com . So, I designed up some simple  urlLink cards , and sent off my order for 250. I should get them in a week.
