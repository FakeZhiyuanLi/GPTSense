       Have you ever noticed that the worst way to mis ssomeone is when they are right beside you andyet you can never have them.....when the moment you can't feel them under your fingertips & you miss them?    --yes :(          Have you ever wondered which hurts the most; saying something and wishing you had not, or saying nothing and wishing you had? I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say. They are the things you get ashamed of because words diminish them, words shrink things that seemed timeless when they were in your head.....to no more than living sizewhen they are brought out....Don't be afraid to tell someone you love them. If you do, they might break your heart...but if you don't, you might break theirs.    --hmmm.. i'll think about that          Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person?   -yes :'(     Your heart decides who it likes and who it doesn't.You can't tell your heart what to do. It does it on its own....when you least expect it, or even when you don't want it to.         Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?    -oh yes... what's wrong with you?? grrr..    Too many of us stay walled because we are too afraid to care too much....for fear that the other person does not care as much, or not at all.    -o come on.. you know me, i'd never do that..          Have you ever loved someone and they had absolutely no idea whatsoever? Or fell for your bestfriend in the entire world, and then sat around and watched him fall for someone else?   -uh huh         Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard tohandle? We tell lies when we are afraid.... afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others might think, afraid of what they'll know about us. But every time we tell a lie....the things we fear grows stronger. Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump. Don't be a person who has to look back andwonder what they would have, or could have had.No one waits forever....    -yes,   i am afraid.   wish he knew.. but... haaay, life's too complicated as it is.. don't want to mess things up further...  hmmm.. cant imagine being with anyone else though

       This is the place where I sit   This is the part when I love you too much   This is as hard as it gets   Cause I'm getting tired of preteding im tough      I'm here if you want me   I'm yours, you can hold me   I'm empty and aching   And tumbling and breaking      Cause you don't see me   And you don't need me   And you don't love me   The way I wish you would   The way I know you could      I dream a world where you understand   That I dream a million sleepless nights   Well I dream a fire when you're touching my hand   But it twists into smoke when I turn on the lights      I'm speechless and faded   It's too complicated   Is this how the book ends,   Nothing but good friends?      Cause you don't see me   And you don't need me And you don't love me The way I wish you would The way I know you could      This is the place in my heart    This is the place where I'm falling apart   Isnt this just where we met   And is this the last chance I'll ever get      I wish I was lonely   Instead of just only   Crystal and see-through   And not enough for you      Cause you don't see me And you don't need me   And you don't love me   The way I wish you would   The way I know you could      Cause you don't see me And you don't need me   And you don't love me   The way I wish you would   The way I know you could

        How many times did I pray      You'd find me    How many wishes on a star   Gazing off into the dark   Dreaming I'd see your face   Safe at home unafraid   Captured in your embrace       So many times   When my heart was broken    Visions of you     Would keep me strong    You were with me all along   Guiding my every step    You are all that I am     And I'll never forget           It was you who first believed   In all that I was made to be   It was you looking in my eyes   You held my hand   And showed me life   And   I've never been the same        Since you first believed              There were times     When I'd thought I'd lost you    Fearing forever was a dream   but it wasn't what it seemed   Placing your hand in mine   You could see in the dark    You were guiding my heart        It was you who first believed In all that I was made to be It was you looking in my eyes You held my hand And showed me life And I've never been the same Since you first believed    It was you who first believed In all that I was made to be It was you looking in my eyes You held my hand And showed me life And I've never been the same Since you first believed       How many times did I prayYou'd find me     How many wishes on a star.

       Okay.. I dont know how im going to let this out.. cause most of you probably dont know what the hell I'm talking about/the whole story.. But anyway, ill tell it to you from the start...  Okaaaay... so my ex-boyfriend, Mj had a bestfriend (Ivan).. who eventually became my bestfriend too.. He meant evrything to me. He was like an older brother, my confidant.. the only one I could ever turn to when I had problems with Mj, school, my family, my parents, friends and everything else.  As some of you might not know.. I was really insecure when I was younger..but when I met Ivan.. everything changed. He made me feel better about myself.. Finally, i didnt feel like i had to change myself to make everyone else happy. He taught me to love and believe in myself.. and he even restored my faith. Anyway, he taught me soo many important things in my life and im really thankful for that..  Anyway, dont get me wrong, Mj and I had a GREAT relationship and ivan was never a "3rd party" but one day.. Mj decided it was over, he just felt nothing between us anymore.. he texted me and broke up with me (yes!! through text!! loser.) anyway, i was torn... this was probably the most painful experience ever cause i lost THE TWO GREATEST GUYS i loved and cared about... (mj didnt want ivan to talk to me anymore.. and we hardly saw each other at school.. mga 1 out of a hundred days lang.. and syempre he HAD TO side with MJ--they were roommates, etc) so there.. basta nagkagulo.. and it all turned out messed up. everyone had bad vibes with each other.. mj said he wanted to stay friends but ha! thats the last i ever heard from him.... sigh..      i missed ivan.   My friend, Krisca and I always talked about what my reaction would be if i ever saw Ivan in school (i tried so hard not to see him.. I was scared and i wasnt ready).. I said i didnt know.. I'd either cry, punch him, kick him, hug him, or totally lose it... shit..  I was so scared . She'd just tell me to text him but i knew.. that wouldnt do anything.. Mj would just tell him to ignore me and stuff... ARRRG it was stressing me out  (Anyway heres what happened)  Yesterday.. I was going down the stairs coz i was about to go home then i saw Ivan.. shit! I could feel my heart up to my throat! It was beating so fast.. When he saw me.. he said hi.. I automatically raised my eyebrow (irap) then went down the stairs.. He ran after me then hugged me. I thought I was going to cry! the moment was so intense.. we talked for awhile then he had to go to a class.. he said he'd text me and i said  "promise?"  (just like we'd say that before :'( ) he said yes.. so i believed him... I said bye and went my way.  When krisca and i got to the first floor.. my tears started pouring.. I was having an emotional breakdown. I didnt even know why i was crying! I think it was because  I was overwhelmed  to see him,  was super happy cause i missed him , or i was mad/sad.. it was confusing... I was so messed up..  Anyway, that night I tried calling ivan's phone to make sure he still had my number (k.. i was desperate. i missed him) then the line didnt exist anymore.. i totally broke down in a mad rage cause i kept thinkin that he was just kidding about ever communicating with me again and i thought that id have to go through this whole emotional phase again.. i thought they were messing with my feelings and i thought i was totally going to go mad..  anyway, i went to bed really early (before 8!!) so i wouldnt cry myself to sleep.. then when i woke up in the middle of the night.. i checked my phone for messages then i saw a new message from an unknown number.. when i opened it, it said  "my new number -mj"  --I couldnt believe it.. so many things were running through my mind.. (did he want to be friends na? why was he even texting me? didnt he want to lose all communication lines with me?? what does this mean?) so anyway, there..  **"did he want to be friends na?" --hmm.. kept thinking bout this... honestly, i would want it better that way. ganun naman talga kaming 3 ever since.. we were more of friends talaga.. even me &amp; mj.. parang really close friends lag kami.. ivan knows me better nga e.. weird.. and as krisca said.. " para kayong tatlong magkakapatid na lalaki.. babae ka nga lang " (okaaaay.. im one-of-the-boys! ..always have ben that way e! haha) --i really want it that way..   wish it were that way  .. i miss them.. i miss my brothers.. :(  anyway, this may seem really shallow to most of you but i just needed to let this all out.  sigh

       A true great love can bear the pain and longitude of waiting  even if it takes forever . When confused about love,  follow your heart  it may not always be right but you will have the memories to make you smile. If your head tells you one thing and your heart tells you another thing,before you decide, you should first think whether you have a better head or heart.         To love someone is to have the courage to walk away and let go of the one who wishes to be free, no matter how much it hurts.      (okay :( )         Love is like a butterfly the more you chase it the more it eludes you,but if you just let it fly, it would come to you, when you least expect it.          On the course of love, people must teach their hearts to be brave enough to hold on when things go wrong, and to be brave enough to Let go when they realized that things are not meant to be after all.    (i wanna be brave)         Words and heart should be handled with care; for words when spoken and hearts when broken are the hardest thing to repair.         Don't shed your tears for someone who hurt you. Don't long for the person if they left. Don't feel sorry if you fail when you try your best. Someone out there is  far more deserving  of your time and love.   (aww.. )         I  n the name of love, it doesn't really matter who won or lost, what's important is that you know when to hold on and when to let go. It's the presence of soul that makes us "Live" but it's the presence of "Love"that makes us want to live.       If your heart gets hurt by the one you truly love... don't let go of the love for the person but let go of the person. You'll never know, love might be sweeter the second time around.It's hard to find true love because are too caught up looking for the perfect person. They don't realize that love is not finding the perfect person but being the perfect person for someone else. Love knows no reason, love knows no lie, love defies all reason, love has no eyes, but love is not blind, they can see but they just don't mind.       Love not because the person is the only one but because the person is the one you are willing to give up everything because  it's worth fighting for .       I  t's hard to pretend to love someone that you don't. But it's harder to pretend you don't love someone that you really do. Once you had love,you will always love. For what's on your mind may escape, but what's in your heart will always remain forever.      Love is not how you forget but rather how you forgive. It is not how you listen but how you understand, but by what you say, but by what you do and not by what you receive but what you give.       True love is wanting the person to be happy even if you won't be the one that the person will share his/her happiness with.       If you love someone,  don't hold back ,never hide your feelings, never economize your love and most of all never take the person for granted because you will never know what you have till it's gone. Sometimes we think that loving someone can be such a risky thing. How else would you win if you don't take chances?  You don't lose by giving, you lose by holding back.    (HMMM...)      Let love be the one to look for you so that when you start to fall, you will always know that the feeling is sure.       Yes!!! It drives you crazy, it makes you mad,jealous sad, it even causes you sleepless nights, breaks your heart.Well come to think of it? It is healthy to fall in love.       True love is not when the hearts beats faster or fastest but when it beats no more and yet the love is still there.          LOVE is not a word to say when we feel guilty, not the right word to say when we like a person...but love really matters when we share our thoughts, minds and hearts.       How do I say goodbye to someone I never had? Why do tears fall to someone who was never really mine? Why do I miss someone I was never been with? Why do I love someone whose love was never truly mine?             ''Love and get Hurt,get hurt and Learn,learn and Love again.."

       (my friend sent this to me... hmmm,just thought it might help out some people out there :D tc!)      A re u ready?       After any long-term relationship it may be tough to find the inner strength or desire to open your heart to love again. When a love interest comes knocking on your door, how do you know that old battle wounds and scars have been healed enough to let love in? Seeing as each person is completely individual, there really isn't a way to know exactly when the right time to begin a new relationship is. What may work for one person, may not work for another.       Fortunately, there are a few key attributes that successful relationships have in common. If you find that you meet these, then it may be time to let love in. When you're ready to analyze your heart's state of affairs, take an honest look at the questions below to determine how ready you really are.       1 - How stable is your life? How can you possibly hope to keep a relationship together if your life isn't put together properly? I think many of us use relationships as a way to help fix ourselves, when actually; we should be trying to do that before we find someone else. Isn't it true that a good many of our love interests result from someone who was there to give us a stable hand? How do you think your next relationship will benefit if you were already stable?      2 - Have you learned something about yourself from every past relationship? (yes!! :)) On our path through life we encounter many different obstacles, people and experiences. This is what makes us unique. Everyone has a different life experience. The people who create happy lives take each experience and make it work for them, especially if it is a negative one. If you haven't learned something about the way you interact with another person from your past relationships, you're living in cycle that won't get broken until you take the time to find out. You can't possibly expect to break negative habits if you're not aware of them.      3 - Have you narrowed down your specific desires as to what type of person you want to meet?Each relationship offers us an opportunity to review our master list of qualities of our ideal mate. Sometimes, what we thought we wanted didn't even come close to what we really needed. After a long-term relationship it is especially prudent to revise your list of desirable traits. Were there things about your past partner that hindered you from being really you? What traits would help you feel the most comfortable with being yourself?      4 - Are you really over your past? (yes.) I know, you're probably thinking it's a misprint? You may be thinking "Don't you mean past love?" Sometimes, I find we identify our past with our past loves. Our life may have included something that was special that we may be feeling is missing now. Somehow that gets wrapped up in our emotions with our past love. So, instead of trying to find new ways to make our life more complete, we think we need to have our past love to feel complete. Make sure you identify your real sources of desire before beginning a new relationship.      5 - Have you talked about your feelings with someone else?It is often easier to deal with the real issues of the heart privately. However, this isn't always the best option. Talking about what's really going on in your mind and your heart gives you the opportunity to release any painful or negative emotions you didn't know you had bottled up. Trust me, there are almost always bottled up emotions you're unaware of. Whoever you talk to, you'll be glad you did.      yup yup! anyway, if any of you need help/someone to talk to.. im here okay? hi krisca! hi tina! hi rose! love y'all!! muaaaaaaaah!! :D

       Crazy For You    Swaying room as the music starts    Strangers making the most of the dark   Two by two their bodies become one    I see you through the smokey air    Can't you feel the weight of my stare   You're so close but still a world away   What I'm dying to say, is that          I'm crazy for you   Touch me once and you'll know it's true   I never wanted anyone like this   It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss   I'm crazy for you, crazy for you     Trying hard to control my heart I walk over to where you are Eye to eye we need no words at all  Slowly now we begin to move Every breath I fall deeper into you Soon we two are standing still in time If you read my mind, you'll see   I'm crazy for you Touch me once and you'll know it's true I never wanted anyone like this It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss I'm crazy for you, crazy for you     It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you And you know it's true I'm crazy, crazy for you

       falling in love is a nice feeling. it makes you look at things differently. it makes you believe in things you never thought could happen. love indeed is a wonderful thing. but what if it turns bitter? what if instead of making you happy, it's making you sad? what if it has taken all the good in you and left only bitterness? what if it makes you miserable? what if all this happens, yet you're still in love? what should you do? should you say goodbye? is goodbye always the answer? for some, it could be but for those who truly believe in love, they hold on. they look forward to that day when it would all be the same again. but that could never happen. nothing would ever be the same unless you are both willing to take a chance. a one-way love could never work. so now do you say goodbye? you remember all the good things love has brought you. you reminisce on all the smiles and the laughter it brought you. you remember all those days when a simple "i love you" could make you feel better. you remember that day you knew that you are in love and the day you found out he loves you too. you remember all those things and you try to smile. but he has said goodbye, should you say goodbye too and move on? again, you reminisce. you remember the numerous goodbye's you've said to each other, but after a day or two, there you are again..saying you love each other. you remember all the harsh words you now are sorry for. you remember leaving so many times but go back the moment you hear his voice. you remember all the forgotten ocassions and all the making-up he does after such. now there you are, remembering how bad it was and remebering how it all went good. and you try to smile and wish it could happen again. you try to make him stay. you say all the things that could probably make one stay but you can't say the one thing he wants to hear. you fear rejection. you fear that even if you've already said what you feel you have to say, he'd still leave you. you fear that that something you thought was always there was never actually there. you fear that you could get even more hurt. you fear to hear what he has to say. you fear to hear from him a real goodbye. so you try to smile, you try to make him see that everything is just fine. the day you've feared most has come. he has come to say goodbye. and this time, you know it's for real. he says he'd be happier alone, and you know it's true. he says that he just can't feel they way he felt before, and you know it's true. so now you say goodbye. you wish him luck and happiness as he takes another road. you hug him tight for the last time to at least have something to remember him by, and you try to smile.

       hmm... ionno, my exes always become bitter.. even if theyre the "dumper's"! hmmmm... weird... maybe theyre just jealous cause i still end up happy/happier without them.. hmmm, i gave my all when we were still in the relationship but still they chose to leave me.. haaaay, ill never really understand why, i really dont care anymore..       dont get me wrong.. im not bitter. ive just learned to accept the fact that they didnt want to be with me anymore. from "its not you,its me" to "i need some time apart" sheesh.. ive heard it all.. one thing im thankful for though, is that each and every relaionship taught me valuable lessons for future relationships and lessons in life as well..      so to all my ex-boys.. thanks, seriously. im not mad anymore, just wish it didnt turn out this bad. wish all of you the best. :) miss bein friends too.. u guys take care :)         *****************************************************************************************************************   Wouldn't life be a little sweeter if we couldall just get along? But when it comes to exes,bad blood too often taints the mix.The weird thing is, theoretically, you used tothink this guy was the bomb! Even if you don'texactly miss being his = significant other, maybeyou do miss his hilarious sense of humor, hislasagna and the ways he really "gets" you as aperson. Okay, so the party's over, but does thatmean you drop out of each other's lives forever?Transitioning from breakup to buddies is a tallorder. = Even with the best of intentions, it'snot always possible to bury the baggage and makea fresh start as friends. But if you're both upfor the challenge, the rewards can be great.If you and your ex want to stay friends, makesure that you:Give it time. Changes of this magnitude doesn'thappen overnight. After a split, there willinevitably be issues to resolve, lives toreconfigure, feet to be gotten back on. It maytake a couple of years or more before relatingin a whole new way is really workable.Disconnect old buttons. Didn't it drive younuts, the way he always left his dirty socks onthe floor? Know what? It's not your problemanymore. Detach from old judgments andirritations that bedeviled your former days as acouple. Remember the bigger-picture stuff youreally like about him, and let the picky stuffgo.Dredge for grudges. If grudges lay buried inyour inner underground, employ grudge-removaltechniques forthwith. Whether your style is tosort it out in a journal, with a therapist or bybeating hand drums and burning sage, do yourhomework and work it through. You can't expectto have an honest friendship until you harbor nohard feelings.Clarify boundaries. Are you absolutely sureyou're ready to be friends, and just friends? Isa little tiny part of you secretly yearning tore-spark the old flame, or have a roll in thehay for old times' sake? If so, stop rightthere. It's not yet time to pursue a platonicfriendship if romantic intentions still residewithin either of you. Wish = each other well, andproceed with establishing your own separatelives for now.Jettison jealousy. Nobody's expecting you tolove the one your ex is with now, but do respecttheir relationship and be cordial, at least.Still, a little jealousy can be a naturalreaction,=20 turning that hip dinner for foursuddenly unappetizingly cold and crusty. Suck itup and be nice. Besides, she's the one who getsto=20 deal with that nasty sock habit now.Offer the olive branch. Accompany it with aslice of humble pie. Forgive yourself, and = him,for blunders and bygones. It's a delicateoperation, but with wisdom, patience, and care,you can welcome this man you once held mostdear, back into your inner circle. Like the oldcampfire song says, "Make new friends and keepthe old. One is silver and the other gold."

       I refuse to wait for you any longer. There was a time in my life when I would have saved myself for you alone. In my heart no one else would do. I belonged to no one else but you. That isn't me anymore. My heart finally caught up with my brain and I finally saw that all of it was just nothing but fantasies. Dreams that only I wanted. There was no hope left for us. As each day passed, it became clearer to me that it was never meant to be. We were never meant to be. I refuse to live in the past. What we shared lives in the past, it doesn't control me any longer. Don't get me wrong, I will forever treasure it but I won't let it hold me back. I won't let it ruin who I was and who I am now. For a time, I almost forgot who I was without you. I'll never let that happen again. I won't ever lose myself again. I refuse to fight anymore. For several months now, I've been fighting. I've been fighting for our friendship and for us. However, no matter what I do, I seem to be losing. Whenever I feel as if I'm going to buckle down because of the pressure, the thought that somehow maybe you are fighting for us too kept me going. But months have passed, I haven't heard from you. Somehow I finally realized that I was the only one fighting for us. I was doing everything I could possibly can for someone who was and never will be mine. I refuse to believe that you didn't love me. Somehow, someway, I know that I have a place in your heart. You may not have been able to love me the way I wanted you to love me but I know that even for just a second, you really did love me. I refuse to lose hope. It may not be you. It may take me forever to find him, but I will. Tears have been streaming down my cheeks for too long but not anymore. I have learned so many things from all this. Things that I felt should have been taught to me some other less painful way but somehow I don't regret it. It made me stronger. It made me look inside myself and really see who I really am and not who I thought I was. Hope kept me going. The hope for better things to come, the same hope that one day I will finally be over you.
