      well...this is my new and very first blog..wow. how very exciting. Lets say today was an odd day for me. Got up this morning because my brother woke me up. (how nice of him -_-) Not sure when that was...I think it was just alittle before 9 this morning. He can be a jerk sometimes..ok.. a lot..but i still love him as a big brother. He doesn't realize that he is my roll modle. Anyway, I got up and had a bit to eat and went outside where my mom told me to feed the animals...gerr I hate doing that. It got done reguardless. Later my sister's friend came over to stock us up on some pop and whatnot for the 4th tomorrow. I was confuzed and thought that she was going to be over tonight to do fire work stuff with us and all...but i thought wrong apparantly, and I supose we'll be doing that tomorrow night then, since tomorrow is officially July 4th :p     My sister's friends are over tonight, Brandy and Aaron. I have no clue what they are doing as far as if they are going to have a bonfire tonight or what. Reguardless I'm sure it will be just as boring as any other bonfire that is usually here. I usually end up being the slave then,  getting the food and stuff and dragging it out back, chairs, setting up the table, all that good stuff...and I dont seem to get a thanks. It sucks being the youngest.   As for the Brandy and Aaron thing, my brother Tom (the one that woke me up) was just plain rude to them, or atleast Aaron. Tom was working on his usualy computer stuff, and getting frustraited when Aaron glanced over at his work on the computer and stuff, and Tom is like "dont touch my computer!"....in my opinion, Tom has got some seriouse issues to work on with his people skills. Hes like that all the time..but to a guest? Thats just plain wrong! following this, Tom went out into our patio room and slammed the kitchen window shut..he has an anger issue with hearing people when hes doing something. anyway, when he did this in his anger he knocked down one of my mothers little snow globes that was sitting on the window ledge and broke it. He was too busy webcamming with someone so I didnt want to be rude and interupt him, unlike him who must come barging in on whomever he likes and getting an attitude, so i went on AIM and told him he had broke it..he didnt give a sh*t..just said "i was f****** SICK of hearing you!"..God sometimes i want to kill him......but i still love him as a brother. Im stuck with him so i have to deal with it.   It was about that time that my mom and sister walked in. I told my mom that Tom was having an additude and being rude...i was upset about his comment about the sick of hearing me...I was about to send im a IM tleling him that i was P'd off at him. Of course my mom saw it, and had not been there to witness what Tom was doing..She told me to settle down, i mouthed off at her because i was upset and told her to tell Tom that. she told me to stop..i was angry and i had never done this to my brother before, telling him what i honestly felt so i just ignored her and continued my typing. she threatend to unplug the computer, i told her what she knew was true "you know how he acts..you know that you want it to stop too" she paused for a second, i could tell i had hit her where it hurt, the "you know what, she right..and i dont like it" spot. Anyway, it ended up that she yelled at me...for what Tom had done..once again taking the blow of what others do. its amazing how that works here..or anywhere im sure.. you know what, if it ends up that there is proof at this house that i didnt do something its just a big F****** mystery about who did it..and a lot of the time its not me, but since im available, its my blame. Like i said, it sucks being the youngest. After i went to my room and slammed the door in anger, i started thinking and stuff..I wanted some way to write down things, like a journal, which i have but it takes way too long to write as oppose to typing so i decided to start a blog..so here it is and there you go. ...If you cant tell.. im one to make a novel out of one days happenings..but since today was the first day to do this i had a lot on my mind...whenever i next update, i dont think it will be as long..  well, cya  -Rachel  aka "The Fledgling Phoenix" aka Phoenix aka WingNut (Wnut) aka Spirit White Wolf (SWW) aka Risk Taker (RT) aka Light Of The Stars (LOTS)  (yup..that sould about do it for nick names :p)  Later!

      yet another week of my life down the drain.........  sorry about my abbrupt leaving last time. my brother kicked me off the computer..not that i really mind. anyway, been yet another hard week. Today, i go to band camp...about 10 minuts ago it would have been that tomorrow im going to band camp...consitering its 12:10 AM >_  yesterday/today sorta...i went to my aunt cheryl(spelling?) and uncle vince's house for a suprize aniversary party that my cousin threw for them. it was fun, and i once again brought up my love of flight and got myself into another peice of that. Its a bummer, my other uncle(ron), who is a flght fan himself, went to the Dayton air show, where as i had not. I had been tempted to call thim that weekend to see if he was going, but i decided not too, and i supose i should have. alwell, no use in crying over it..its done and overwith. and besides, im looking forward to going to a different air show in about a month anyway...of course, it all depends on how it works out.   its kind of funny though, i struck up a convorsation with my aunt jane about how i had gone to the USAF musuem, and when i mentiond to her, the feeling i got when i sat in that mock up cockpit (the tottaly awesome overwhlming oh my god this is so cool feeling), she popped the question "have you ever consiterd being a pilot then?"..i decided not to hold back on my answer and finnaly let it out instead of the usual shrug.."Actually yes i really want too...ive like the idea of doing so since i was in 5th grade"..which is the truth...(suprize to any of my siblings who might end up reading this)  it was then that the night started turning around. my uncle ron stated talking to me about it, and my uncle vince gave me a bunch of old books on planes when he found out about the fact that i was into planes..my dad mentiond me loving planes and flight while family and friends where sitting around talking and stuff..man..not to long ago did i have the first few steps of finnaly cutting loose the worries of what people thought and finnally took a dive into all this...i really feel like this is what i want to do/follow in my life. :-\  then there are times i look at myself in the mirror and wonder how that girl i see could ever end up doing something like that...and then there are the times when i look at the girl and think about how she had such a cool dream shes finnaly going for..*sigh*...not to mention, the election thing going on. Im for Kerry, especially after watching a large parth of the democratic convention. they had some awesome speakers there, and i agreed with almost everyhing they said. i dont think im going  bother watching the republican convention..i might just die from it ---> x_X ...that reminda me of some awesome news...my family is going to go see kerry today..that is..in 12 and plus hours...i wont be going..because of death camp..aka band camp..but my dad, mom, sister, and hoppfully both my brothers will get to go.   you know what, i think i know why tonight has been such a crazy night..its full moon..not to mention, a blue moon. and on the night of the 1st of August, the month of which this year will have a friday the 13th O.o thats just creapy..anyway, i think im going to go to bed...cuz in 10  hours, im off to the school to load up for band camp..and whill have officially have left the house just before 11:30..  ill cya later..iom a bout a week or more..  -Rachel, aka Phoenix

      yup..been awhile again. ive had another hard week. things with the war and President Bush and all, its just all really getting on my nerves. i went over to my friends house for about an hour and a half so we could get her computer up and running, which my brothter had fixed. the other night, i left my MSN and Yahoo IM for good, or atleast untill furthur notice. Its really been affecting my sleep schedule and my emotions..things as such. for some reason, ive just been really easilly depressed and stuff..i was watching the news last night, and all the stories made me want to break out in tears. mostly it was because so much of it was about shootings and car accidents and things like that. then there was a somewhat national news storie of a plane in colorado that crashed in a residential area. I almost cried! i remember when i heard about that jet crashing at an airshow in ukrain last year, i bursted out in tears. it was really sad because the jet malfunctiond, and the pilots ejected and lived, but some 80 or more people on the ground werent so lucky. i remember watching the explosion on a old black and white TV of my gradpas at his house before we sold it. we were re-doing my grandpas house before he passed away, getting it ready to sell, and we had that old TV sitting on the fire place thing, on the local news. i was already emotionally choked out because my grandpa was going to die soon, and then i saw the news, and for some reason, seeing it in black and white and actually watching the impact just really hit me. for some reason, when i see the aftermath of something like that it just doesnt bother me as much. Im really glad i didnt see the jets hit the towers on september 11th. I think i would have layed in bed crying for a long long time. but the thing that was even more sad about that, was that i didnt hear what exactally had happend until around 1:40 pm that day at school. and i can remember all to well exactally what it was like when i did.    *sigh*......i just dont know what to think of this all. God has thrown a lot of things at me in the past 4 years. i just try to think that it could be a lot worse. i just hope it dosnt end up really bad.   *snaps back to present time* in other news, ive been in band practice for a week now. this week is promising to be a hard one. doing marching an all, playing music out the butt. this comming week is known as HWMBME Hell Week for all Marching Band Memebers of Elida(my school)..usally just plain Hell Week.   The reason for the name, is because we do all the intense playing and preparing for Band Camp. which is next week. Band camp is where we learn our marching shows and memorize the music. We go to a 4H camp and stay there for a week, oppose to what most area bands band camp is: our Hell Week. We are quite proud of our bands marching. We do harder marching than most area high school marching bands. the only way we get better then the common bands  around is by having 3 weeks of hours of practice a day. all this week from monday to thursday we will have 4 hours of band pracice a day, and at band camp, we have all day of band practice, minus breakfast, dinner, supper, sleep, and free time.   ger..have to go..bye

      well today has been a lousy excuse for a day of doing things. yesterday was cool though. The USAF museum was awesome. I saw so many planes yesterday, i barely could soak it all in. I got to sit in an F-4 cockpit. (its a fighter jet... its gennerally called a Phantom or Phantom II)..the feeling of sitting in that cockpit just blew me away to say the least. It was like, i sat down in that thing and it was sort of a "oh my god" moment. i wish it actually flew :p wouldnt mind going on a joy ride at a few hundred MPH.  I didnt get to bed untill the wee hours of the morning last night because i was talking to someone on IM for a long time, and when im talking on IM, time seems to dissapear. I was almost sure i was going to have a dream about planes in one way or another..but alas when i woke up, if i had any, i didnt remember them. Today however has been just plain BORING....i went to band practice for 2 hours this morning which was just as exciting as buzzing your lips off and blowing through a trumpet for 2 hours..wait..thats exactally what i did!..and then when i got home there was about a hour skip and then it was off to the dentist....and then back here. for some reason, everyones all tired today. even those of us who didnt go to the museum yesterday..as soon as my mom and I got home, it think my mom crashed out on the couch or something. she was tired as ever. I myself had quite alot of energy this morning and now i feel like colapsing. must be the weather or something...alwell.   thats all for now...  -'Phoenix'

Ive been getting into arguments with my mom more often, and my mom and dad are arguing more often..of course..thats nothing new. in the past week, ive just been generally down about things. I usually try not to think about people dieing, but the past week has just been alot of it. ive heard about famouse people dieing and people i kind of know, and things like that. besides that ive really had a few things on my mind latly. id reather not discuss on them.   if nothting else, am atleast excited about going to the USAF musuem today. im leaving in about an hour. i was orriginaly going to go to the Dayton air show saturday, but my dad suddenly had to work. Today, i was going to aswell, but it didnt seem all the worth while when my brother didn't want to go today, because of his work tomorrow. he had wanted to go saturday so he wouldnt get tired today and then be dragging butt the next morning..after some discussion, it ended up that my dad, mom, and I are going the the USAF museum. im really quite excited as weird as it sounds..   well ill update later and stuff. need to go get ready.   cya yall later..  -"phoenix"

      so far today has been pretty much like yesterday..i was once again woke up by the phone. this time it was my moms friend calling..so i went to my bed and tried to go back to sleep but it was in vain. so i got up and watched some TV....i got bored of that, so i decided that i hadnt played my playstation2 for awhile...well, that didnt go so well. i turned it on, the screen was all weird like lines going through it, and the picture wasent showing up with the litte boxes and whatnont floating round that leads to the browser menu. when it tried to give me video it just gave me a big blue screen. gerr. i think its dead..ill have to see if my brother can revive it. hes good at all that electronic stuff. infact, he got a ps2 free from someone who wanted him to see if he could fix these 2 PS2s that had gone bad. he got one working, but the person said he could have it because it had required some pretty heavy hackings. so i guess if i want to play, then ill have to ask him/use his from now on. poo. i just hope he can get mine working again...i hope i didnt damage it to badly when i hit it really hard in anger *cough*ahem...  anyway, after that i went on here with lack of anything to do. and wated to go rant to someone about my delema of a dead ps2 :( no one was on so i decided to blog.   i would tell you how the rest of yesterday went but my mom just got back, and is insiting i do some things..yay! something to do! :p  cya later  -"phoenix"

      today has been an uterly boring one. i had a rude awakening of my mom calling the house from my grandparents house seeing if i was awake..i said "well yea... im awake now!"...basically i sat on the couch all morning watching various shows..just generally being a couch potato. got on yahoo IM a few times but no one was on..eventually decided to go blog. As far as the rest of yesterday went, just after i got off here my firend woke up and called her mom who told her she was going to be out of town, so my friend could either go home or stay over here. she decided to go home so i was bored for the majority of the day. im quite jealous (please excuse my bad spelling) at her. she gets to go with her b/f to cedar point..gerr. she said that her and her mom and stuff were planning on going and inviting me to come with them, but her b/f invited her to go with him so now her mom basically said there is no point in going twice...thus no cedar point for me..pooo. anyway, i spent about 2 hours stripping down the remains of the party from previous night yesterday after she went home. after that i spent the rest of the day doing mainly what im doing now...nothing..  well i must be off..my mom has assigned me some chores and whatnot to keep me busy..see ya later.  ~Rachel, aka Phoenix

      Ok this post is really on the 5th (i had a second blog that i copied the first(and only) post into here. i made some horrible spelling mistakes when i named the blog and typed in the url..so i made a new one, which is what it was suposed to be like in the first place...  Last night was quite fun. We all had fun together and my friend Tia even came over and spent the night here. We had fun hanging out, and setting off fire works of various assorts. Most people who look at me probably dont know that i have a new love of having something in my hand on fire and about to explode or spin around in an array of color (jumping jacks ect..)...before the 3rd i had only once held one on fire to throw it and i was not very used to it, never had something in my hand that could possibly blow up in it before. that was about 2 or 3 years ago...well on the night of my last blog entry (the 3rd) i got to do some of my first fire works lighting. it was very very very awesome feeling once you got used to it. last night i didnt do quite as much, but i still did. My friend wasnt feeling well, so she mainly sat around the whole time...im sure she eventually felt better because we were hanging out later, and she wasnt near as pale and sad looking...My sibblings and buddies were outside for the majority of the early morning...somewhere around 3 they came in, drunk as hell from playing a drinking game. this morning you can deffinataly tell who had it worst. I just hope they all wake up..so far most everyones up, except for my brothers. unless they are up and i dont know...i just hope they are ok. As far as my friend and I, were confined to the house inside and not alowed to even watch them, because of our under-agednessd...(is that a word? :p)its was still fun to watch them periodically come in with a buzz and act funny. even though my siblings and co came in first, Tia and I where the last ones asleep..and i was the last one period. i went to bed at 4 or so.   besides that, today has just begun for me. i got up, my friend was still sleeping, so i got up and let her sleep and went on here to update...what fun. and look! i have a whoping 12 hours left of my 24 hour day. 12 of them are already past! 4 of which i was awake in the early morning, 6 1/2 of which i have slept, and 1 1/2 of which i have been up from sleeping..and now its noon..thus 12 hours left of my day. what to do what to do?... :) :p   well, im going too be on my way. im hoping my next update wont be like a month later..but hey, alwell.   cya! -"Phoenix"

      well, i just got back from band camp............*sigh* what a week......im sooooo tired..and my body is so spent from marching..and im burnt to a crisp. it was hard work....and some/ alot of it was dissapointing....but for the majority of it, it was very rewarding...we learned 2 half time shows, and pregame.......what fun..seniors however, ruined one of the band greatest and most looked forward to traditions that has taken place at camp palmer for the longest time..the senior prank..and this year was Elida band's last.  this years seniors took our instramewnts and layed them out on the feild in the numbers "05" (for class of 2005)they had director approval..IF they cept instraments in their casses..sure enough they took some of them out..and the dumb arses left out snare drums on the feild, which the band boosters had just spent a nice chunk of monery fixing..the snare things got wet and it ruined them. thus the last senior prank ever because of this...gerrrr. some people...at least the seniors are the ones who pay for it.....not the rest of the band.   well, im spent..im gonna go sleep and stuiff..ttyl  -Rachel "Phoenix"
