        The great questions of the day will not be settled by means of speeches and majority decisions but by iron and blood.        So, to say that, what is all this fuss over Kerry's speech? I personally did not watch it. I would rather listen to rap than John Fuckin' Kerry--well, maybe that is an exaggeration, but you get the picture--and from what I heard from others I did not miss much at all.  Some people might not care who ends up in the White House this winter, but I care. All I can imagine happening if we elect Kerry is the spawning of a nation of faggots, child-murderers, and wimps. We don't need gay marriage. We don't need abortion. We don't need illegal drugs. We don't need welfare or social security.  We  do  need spending on defense, beating the national debt, and continuing support for the war on terror. The only places the government should spend money on socially is education and economic infrastructure such as highways and urban development. We  do  need those if we are to continue to be a world power.  We need to be careful that we do not succumb to tyranny--another word for terror. The first things that Hitler took away were the populationsâ€™ weapons, their beliefs, and their intelligence. He raped Germany for all she was worth, and look where it got them today.  So, hang onto your guns, keep your faith, and do not grow ignorant, or Kerry or someone even worse is going to end up telling  you  what to do.

          After seeing the remake of The Manchurian Candidate in theaters last night, I plan to rent and view the 1962 version. The remake is amazing, and what people are saying about the original makes me want to see it all the more.    Of course this movie brings up some interesting conspiracy theories, the least of which being those theories which claim our own government carried out experiments into the ring of the paranormal. Whether or not we did make such strides into the fields of hypnotism and brainwashing, such theories--and now movies--clearly bring up the question of the morality of such actions.  Conspiracy theorists are quick to point an accusing finger at the government regarding these issues, but if one must first ask  why  they believe in right or wrong before they question another's methods and motives.  As we determined with the last post, the ends do not always justify the means. Even though the survival of an individual or a species may seem noble enough, survival of one oftentimes signals the trampling of the rights of others. Sort of a "this town ain't big enough for the two of us" mentality is often  reality .  So does that mean that the goal of survival, a trait of many living things, is an evil attribute of mankind?  Well what is evil?  In the movie last night, which I will try to relate to without issuing too many spoilers, you'd think that Raymond Shaw's (Liev Schreiber) mother (Meryl Streep) would eventually realize that the actions she is sponsoring are twisted and evil;  bad science . Yet her and many  real  people do just such things that are frowned upon by the general population.  So is good and bad a constant, across all humanity, or is it relative, changing based on the current situation of each individual?  I tend to believe, based on my faith, that morality is a constant, the same standard for everyone.  And if this is the case, as I so believe, it is imperative for those who respect common morality to fight for and defend the life, liberty, and happiness of those who might be having their rights impeded by those who do not respect morals.

        So I am looking at this ass. A female ass. A girl's  butt  for all you who don't know what I am talking about. And I get to thinking, which is rare for me;  why exactly am I looking at this ?          Now that is a good question. Some people might say that I am just a perverted little bastard--maybe not far from the truth. Some stupid American kids might claim that it is simply because it's a  nice  ass. Other, more "scientific" people might say that it is because it is a built in reaction of the male mind to be attracted to such things.  While I tend to lean on the findings of the first hypothesis, of me being a bastard, it is a fact that whether we like it or not we often act before we know why.  Such can be illustrated as to what happens in the following situation.  Say, for example, you have three separate people in three separate rooms. You open the door to the first room, on a person who is a kind, peaceable, friendly person. You start up a conversation, which goes basically  nowhere , but this person is content because a simple exchange of friendly language appeals to them.  Then suddenly, out of the blue, you throw a punch; nailing this unsuspecting person in the jaw, bone connecting with bone. You follow up with a swing into the center of the chest, another to the stomach, and as the person bends forward following the hit to their belly; you bring your knee up hard, flattening their nose against their skull.  They cry out in pain, and fall to the ground, collapsing into a fetal position, their hands covering their face for  protection .  You shrug; anything you would have said to the person would have been pointless, as they are screaming too loud to be able to hear you anyways, and then you immediately leave the room, shutting the door behind you, the cries of pain dissipating into echoes.  The second room holds a more distrusting--shall we say paranoid?--person. This person heard the screams from the room next door and is not so content to start a friendly conversation. They first ask what is happening in the room next door. You announce that it is "nothing," so not to disturb your independent variable in this experiment.   Whack!   Whackwhack! Whump!   Same story over again, but this individual does not just stand there. This person actually manages to absorb the final motion, and instead of a knee flying into the center of their face, you only manage to glance your appendage off the side of their head, following a desperate roll they make to the ground. The person is on their feet immediately, hands protecting their body, like a boxer, blood streaming down their face.  They scream at you to get back, but despite their desperate measures of achieving defense-- protection --, you are a better fighter and they are quickly dispatched, following a pair of kicks to their legs and then face.  The third person is a career Kung Fu instructor. As soon as you pass through the door to the next room you are lying in a puddle of your own blood. This person watched you take out the first two people, and was not going to let the same happen to himself. He utilized his skills for  protection .  So despite the fact that we are all different--individuals--we all share the same common goals. Though we may attempt to reach these goals through different means--some of which are more successful than others--we may all want peace, or freedom, or any other type of human-common goal in the end.  The real catcher here is that different means are more successful than others. The end does  not  always justify the means.  So decide now, how you will reach the goals of the future. My way; or the highway?    And then I closed the picture of the luscious bottom and typed this.          By the way; I do not necessarily endorse the looking-on-of-asses. It just happened to appear, from somewhere, in this case. Remember, I  do  tend to be a bastard quite a bit of the time.

          When I was first instructed in the art of fire-making, I was given one rule to stand by; if you smart small, you can always grow larger, but in the case of fire, starting to big only means that you will burn all of your available fuel before the fire can be of any use. A fire can always be spread--unless it collapses in on itself as soon as it sparks.    Same goes for politics.  Many great idealists with messages of great potential burned out before they could make their mark in the world.  This Weblog--"Blog"--is starting small. How much damage can a single Blog do? Not much.  How much damage can a Blog Network, with hundreds (or perhaps even thousands) of readers do? Quite a bit, possibly.  So, brothers and sisters of a great crusade, start small, with me, learning and practicing, and one day we will grow to be a great force of power
