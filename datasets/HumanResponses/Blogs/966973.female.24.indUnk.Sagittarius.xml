						   Here’s a detail of my professional life that has been bothering me for a while.  I suppose I could summarize it by saying this: the levels to which people within our society’s various echelons of corporate structure fail to grasp even the most obvious and obtuse details of said structure is pure madness.  Let me explain.  If you’ve never worked in big business, you may be surprised and somewhat disheartened to find out that no CEO, VP, or other such high-ranking officer within a company writes, speaks, or really thinks for him/herself.  When you receive a letter, a phone call, a greeting card from a person of this nature, you’re actually receiving the product of a team of assistants, analysts, and other sundry staffers.  Hell, s/he probably didn’t even sign it her/himself.  Them’s the breaks, and you might as well get over it.  I don’t really have a problem with this, per se, though I find it pretty amusing.  The simple truth is that the success and endurance of the American corporate structure rests heavily on the elaborate system of buffers that surround The Powers That Be.  It’s pretty reasonable, really—if we allowed anyone and everyone access, both incoming and outgoing, to TPTB, the bullshit levels would really get to be intolerable.  The teams of buffer staff would instead spend their time cleaning up all the messes created therein rather than maintain what actually shakes out to be a pretty efficient buffer system.  Anyway, so the buffers are real.  What really rattles me is the levels to which people from other equally corporate structures seem completely oblivious to and often indignant about the existence of such buffers in my organization.  What the hell?  The number of people who call here and ask to speak to our SVP (asking for him, of course, by FIRST NAME) and proceed to identify themselves only by their first name and refuse to state their company or purpose for calling is really staggering.  Seriously.  They try everything, too.  They’ll get all shirty and demand to speak to him, then they’ll name-drop for a minute, assuming we’ve never heard of these people but will be really impressed that the caller has a battery of names to vomit on command.  I have to admit, the snarkier people get with us, the more resistant we are to let them through the buffer.    Oh, and don’t believe it, ever, when anyone tells you so-and-so is in a meeting/just stepped away/is behind closed doors if you’ve already told them your name and reason for calling.  You’ve just been defeated by the buffer, and there’s nothing you can do about it.

						   So I recently made reference to a list of People I'd Like to Kick in the Teeth, and it wasn't an idle tease.  This list will be ever-evolving, as it would be really difficult to ever shut the editorial door on such a broad and dynamic category.  Anyway, here it is in its current form.    ***The Welch's Grape Juice Girl.  Not the reasonably cute one of indistinguishable Asian decent--the blond freak from a few years ago. She actually started her career in commercials (okay, I first noticed her) with a dishwasher ad for Sears.  She was pretty insufferable then, but nothing like the mass of despicability she became during her tenure with Welch's.  Gag.  ***The Dell Kid.  I have no idea what affliction has stricken him such that his face must contort and spasm apparently independent of the rest of his body, but gawd.  If he could dial down the crazy about 6 notches, I could probably tolerate him, but at this point I'm about at my limit.  Dude, I'm getting my sledgehammer.  ***The Yes-I-can-freaking-hear-you-now Guy.  In the beginning, I actually thought this was mildly amusing, and sometimes even a little clever (such as the spot that appeared during the season premiere of Dawson's Creek where he stood in that boat in that creek).  At this point, however, I'm over it.  Not just in the I'm-over-the-mild-humor-that-once-was way, but the I'd-rather-weave-a-slinky-through-my-nasal-passages-than-see-this-dead-horse-beaten-again way.  Seriously, let's give the poor corpse a rest.  ***The Mazda Zoom-Zoom Kid.  I never thought this child was appealing.  Ever.  His little voice actually creeps me out beyond words.  I shudder every time I hear the music for a Mazda commercial beginning to vamp because I know it's coming....'zoom zoom.'  Yick.  ***Nicole Kidman.  Way too much color going on here, and a consistently in-your-face display of an inordinately high self-confidence, given her rather blah career. I normally steer far and wide from any celebrity gossip and whatnot, but I'm going to have to agree that Tom definitely traded up with Penelope Cruz.  Kidman never ceases to find new ways to squick me out.  For exmaple, there's a scene in Eyes Wide Shut (a totally worthless movie, btw) where she stands up to wipe after going to the bathroom.  I mean, she was once seated, and then advances to a fully erect, fully vertical standing position at which point she commences with the wipe and deposits the used TP behind her in the toilet.  What. The. Hell.   ***The aforementioned Texas car dealers and furniture fellas.  Like I said, stay tuned for updates.

						   If you've never been to Texas, you'll probably never understand me when I say it's like a whole 'nother country here.  I experience frequent, though fleeting, moments of utter paralysis when a little voice in my head reminds me that I LIVE here.  It's usually followed by another voice that whines "Nuh-uh!" and thus the paralysis starts, since the first voice has the bonus of reality to make its case and therefore inevitably wins.    It will never be home, for many reasons.  A large many of those reasons can be captured in the weather category, because the meteorological happenings of this place are just plain batshit crazy, and resemble nothing that comes close to my frame of, say, normal.  I'll come back to this much more in the future, but for now let's just say I don't get it. How in the name of all that is holy can it rain so damned much with absolutely no warning?  And the humidity....yeesh.  I recently conceded defeat in the three-year battle with my hair in which I have languished dispiritedly while attempting to grow it long.  Given the number of days wherein the air quality outside bears frightening similarity to a giant post-hot-shower bathroom, the ongoing quest for straight, non-frizzy, non-bushy hair seems a ridiculous exercise in wasting time and ending up with merely a set of tired arms to show for my labor.  So it's all gone, end of battle.  But this isn't the moment in which I feel like waging my fullout disapproval of the weather in this place.  No, right now I'd like to attack the insidious beast that is Texas car dealership ads.  I'm serious, if you want to completely overdose on your class-A good ole' boy Texas expectorant, spend a Sunday afternoon with Texas cable stations and you'll be good to go.  The market is so large that the budget for most dealerships is actually high enough to produce decent-looking local commercials--a far cry from the locally-produced pieces of crap I know from home.  However, if I'm going to put Texas car dealership commercials up against the local business wastes of airspace from back home, I'll go ahead and say the Texas ads lose overall, regardless of higher quality.  Don't get me wrong, those ads from home are nauseating as all hell, but I'm pretty sure it's a uniquely Texas thing to watch local ads and actually feel less smart. While we're at it, go ahead and lump local furniture store ads in that category.  Though certainly not as well-produced, they equal (if not surpass) the stupidity levels of the dealership ads.  In fact, I'm going to go ahead and pencil in the primary purveyors of said local ads to my list of People I'd Like to Kick in the Teeth (publication forthcoming).

						   Hoo.  It’s been a while since my last post.  Busy times here, and not entirely in a good way.  Well, let me rephrase that: there have been ups and downs, and the downs are making me sad as hell right now.  I’m thinking we’ll get everything covered nicely here with a recap of the turmoil, followed by a few random bitchings.  To recap:  I made major headway on the career thing and have managed to successfully pry myself off the ceiling.  Only a very select group of people in my life right now is privy to the new plan, and since that group doesn’t yet include my parents I’d rather keep it out of cyberspace for now.  Sawwwy.  But all is well on that front.  The more I work on my new plan, the more at ease I feel.  Clearly, good decisions abound.  Sadly, such goodness doesn’t color the rest of this update.  Arg…it started last Monday when my Dad emailed me to tell me (rather flippantly, I might add) that two of our dogs broke loose and ended up getting hit by a car and killed.  As if that weren’t traumatic enough, my father’s wife went and found a new dog the same damn week!  Not just any dog, a 9-month old border collie who has never had a name and has been kept in a kennel for the persuasive majority of her life.  What a prize, really.  Later that day (Monday), I had lunch with Mr. Drama, one of my closest friends.  For the record, we were good friends in college, had a brief and tumultuous dating encounter which was followed by a few months of we-can-totally-sleep-together-and-just-be-friends nonsense…now we’re friends again.  The point of Monday’s lunch was to provide a venue in which Mr. Drama could tell me all about the latest installment in the Mr. Drama Top Ten Dramatic Moments catalog. Prior to lunch, all I knew about the incident was that it resulted in him wearing (proudly, I might add) a woman’s necklace.  No, seriously, a silver heart pendant that smacks of an Elsa Peretti knockoff; it has no business being worn by a man.  None. Whatsoever.  Anyway, I’m going to skip the long version because it makes my head hurt and my stomach queasy.  Short version: after spending ONE weekend with an old friend from college he is head-over-heels in love and planning to move two states away to be with her in May.  They think the wedding will be in a year or two.  Are you fucking kidding me?  I only wish.  Worst part (and really, this was tough to pick): we’re driving back from lunch and as a *joke*, I ask “So, you’ll invite me to the wedding, right?”  He looked thoughtful for a moment and replied “Well, yes, if we’re still in touch.”  Well pass the Twang, bartender, because this papercut clearly needs some prodding before I achieve quality pain.    So that sucked, though not so much as breaking up with Boy at the end of the week.  * Sigh *  It was the best thing, considering our respective positions on relationships at this time in our lives (briefly: I want one, he doesn’t—not a lot of negotiation progress to be made there).  Thankfully, it ended quite well (aside from the gut-wrenching sadness).  We’re bound and determined to remain friends, which is stellar—I think the part that had been plaguing me most this week as things became increasingly weird was the thought of not having him in my life at all.  Conclusion: I’m still batshit crazy about him and am taking a few weeks to get some of that out of my system so we can get on with being friends again.  At least I haven’t lost him completely.  Okay, that pretty much takes care of the recap.  I can’t quite put my finger on what I plan to bitch about today, so I’ll just leave you with the following indisputable truth:  BOYS ARE STUPID.

						   CRISIS PENDING  Holy hell, people, it's all sorts of screwed up right now.  Last night, while inching through the med center in heinous H-town traffic, I realized that (drumroll) I don't think I want to go to medical school after all.  (Sound of head hitting desk repeatedly)    ACK! I'm just not sure I want to assign eight years of my life to nothing but manic chaos and aggressive competition, and it seems like a pretty stupid thing to get myself into without being pretty damn sure.  Med school is an extremely tiring and expensive place to decide you really want to do something else.  What the fuck?  I literally had a panic attack while driving and discovering all this.  Truly, I couldn't breathe, my chest was tight, everything was a little hazy and this overwhelming sense of panic just took over.  I almost pulled over but the sheer inertia of the whole thing made me keep going--that, and I was in the lane I needed to be to turn onto my street, so the part of my brain (albeit a tiny part) that remained rational said what the hell, head for the house.  I can't help thinking about all sorts of other options...specifically neuromuscular therapy and pain management.  That's the part of medicine that's always intrigued me anyway, so maybe I should find my way into it through a channel that allows me to start practicing for real before I'm 30 and allows time for, oh, say, a life and a family?!?  Shocking demands I place on life, no?  Arggg.....this sucks beyond words.  I just pulled my own rug out from under my feet, so I'm scared as hell, but I can't help loving the idea of new options.  Help?  Methinks this will be a weekend of reading and consulting with trusted personal advisors.

						   There’s a subcategory to People I’d Like to Kick in the Teeth that needs mention: People Who Give Completely Unsolicited Commentary and Advice.  You know them, you’ve met them, please tell me you aren’t one of them.  If you are, please leave my blog immediately and begin paying penance for your miserable behavior.  I’m not even close to kidding, this shit is annoying and it needs to stop.  Nothing brings about a hefty dose of UC&A than smoking.  Yeah, I smoke, sue me.  Yes, I am well aware of the health hazards, and no, my parents didn’t totally fail.  I just happen to really like smoking.  Really.  Okay, there’s a small part of me that also really likes sticking it to those bastards from truth.com, because the scare tactic thing is pretty over-the-top at this point.  People will do what they want to do, self-destructive or not, no matter how many body bags you show them.  It’s just one of those things you can either lament deeply or just plain get over.  Hell, I really don’t care if you get over it, just hush it up when you see me.    Back to the main road.  I am often, and by often I mean like more than once a month, approached by a total stranger while I smoke who offers his or her stance on my choice of pastime.  Back in college, I had a much friendlier response battery than I do now.  Back then, when someone would tell me I really should stop smoking, I would usually say (replete with big, sweet smile) “And you should really start.”  It usually shut them down, but in that friendly-but-tolerably-biting way.  Now, it’s not so pretty.  See below:  STRANGER: You should quit. ME: So should you. STRANGER: But I don’t smoke… ME: I meant your other habit. STRANGER: Oh yeah, and what’s that? ME: Handing out unsolicited advice.  See what an ass I’ve become?  But really, people, lay off me and my cigarettes.

						   I knew I wouldn’t last all afternoon without thinking of something to bitch about.  Here goes…  What the hell is going on with the gum packaging revolution sweeping the country?  Once upon a time—like, 18 months ago—the dominant gum presentation option was the traditional and highly appealing stick wrapped in foil.  I was down with that.  You had 15 sticks in a pack—20 in a bonus pack—and everything was kosher. I grew up with those sticks—made tiny foil airplanes and cranes out of the wrappers, initiated several attempts to smoosh the foil into as compact a ball as possible, etc.  The foil, I might add, was an invaluable thing to save for later as an incredibly convenient disposal receptacle.  It didn’t matter if you were near a trashcan when your gum died; you were prepared with your very own means for disposal.    The apparent wisdom and practicality of this system was apparently lost on the nation’s gum manufacturers.  All they want to sell me these days are those bizarre little rectangular blobbies that they insist on hermetically sealing in a foil blister pack.  Foil? What the hell? It’s GUM, not Nyquil, for the love of Pete.  This is, of course, to completely overlook my utter disgust with the new sizing of the blobbies.  You pop one, chew it, and within a matter of a few seconds it’s the size of about three mini Chiclets.  When I want me some gum, I want me some gum.  Whenever I’m forced to buy the ridiculously formatted gum, I always end up popping like three pieces at a time.  That’s just bad economy.

						   I pleasantly alarmed to report that, at present, I don’t have anything to bitch about.  In fact, I’m pretty apeshit happy this morning because the current social scenario with a guy I met a few weeks ago is rolling along swimmingly.  I could probably be talked into writing a few posts about how great it’s going, blah blah blah, but I hate the people who are wont to such smooshy rambling.  So, you’ve had a great couple of dates and are over-the-moon for each other?  Woo, hooray, rejoice.  The villagers will receive an extra 10 beans in their pay bucket to celebrate your burgeoning relationship….now get back to work.  Know what I mean? Yep, you don’t want to hear my gushing about this cute, cute man.  Hee…what a cutie…okay, I’m stopping.

						   Well then!  I’m back from the wilds of the Montana, and I’m sorry to report that there wasn’t any snow.  At least it wasn’t excruciatingly cold—only in the teens and twenties.  It was a lovely trip and I got plenty of much-needed rest.    Getting out of town, however, was less than simple.  After a lengthy and bloody battle, I admitted defeat and decided Phoebe would stay home rather than be boarded with Max.  I managed to screw up the pillowcase trick the first time, and after that it was really over.  With twelve minutes remaining until the pet resort closed for the night, I finally gave up, crammed a very scared and desolate Max into his carrier and took off.  In our struggles, Phoebe had managed to dig her back feet into the palms of both my hands leaving clusters of deep punctures that were actively bleeding stigmata-like as I drove to drop off Max.  Needless to say, upon seeing my hands the folks at Rover Oaks were rather pleased to hear that Phoebe wasn’t coming.  Thankfully, a kind friend at work was willing to stop by and check in on her during the week.  Though she didn’t destroy the apartment and seems to be in fine shape, she’s vehemently angry with both Max and me.  Max, contrary to my fears, had a fabulous time and doesn’t seem worse for the wear at all.  Apparently, he loved the attention and made several new friends.  $140 later, everyone comes out okay.    My car accident saga continues, as will be further detailed in the List.  Other than dealing with that, general boredom at work, tornadic activity to the north, and the looming threat of being killed in my sleep by an angry calico, things are swell and it’s good to be back.  I love going home, but there’s such a sense of life-suspended while I’m there that I kind of like coming back to my routine, even though I don’t like my routine at the moment.  Oh, and I finally decided on a topic for my book.  It’s going to be great, but the research will take a while, so no further details at this time.  Stay tuned…  Anyway, here’s this week’s list.  Things I Like  • The Cosby Show.  God Bless Nickelodeon for airing old episodes all the damn time.  This weekend, they had two marathons of classic episodes…I was in heaven.  I think part of the draw for me is that their family is so much more fun than mine.  Well, I guess my family is fun if you’re an outsider and are watching the circus-like spectacle unfold before you.  Being trapped there by blood, however, makes it difficult to see the fun in the millionth semi-drunk karaoke exhibition.  What can I say, I’m a square peg in a family of round holes.  Anyway, I dig the Huxtables.  I went through a phase as a child when I thought they might adopt me if I wrote in to the show.  I was pretty sure they wouldn’t mind that I was white, and it seemed like the house had endless bedrooms.  • Sleep.  And man, could I ever use some right now.  • Big ideas.  I am soooo excited about my book.  It’s really one of the best ideas I’ve ever had and I actually have a plan to see it through to completion.  Though I have no idea what the final form will look like, the research process is going to be pretty freaking amazing.    • Cute children.  I have to admit, I saw a bevy of adorable and relatively well-behaved children while traveling to and from the great MT.  I definitely went through a ‘kids are scary’ phase, but I think it’s over now.  Though ill-behaved children (especially of the shrieking variety) still drive me up the wall, the rest of them are great and I honestly wish I saw more of them.    • Nigella Lawson.  I love the way this woman cooks, almost as much as I love the way she writes about cooking.  If you aren’t familiar with her, she’s a British chef whose television show recently started airing in the US.  She has written two cookbooks, one of which I own, and she’s just an overall great addition to the cooking tableau.  Her show is pretty cool, although it freaks me out a little when she licks her fingers and keeps cooking.  I totally do that in my own kitchen, but never when other people are definitely going to eat the food.  If other palates are involved, I wash hands often, use spoons once, the whole enchilada.  I’d like it if she made at least a pretense towards believing in such standards for guests.    • Norah Jones.  If you haven’t heard her cd yet, go buy it. Don’t borrow it from a friend, unless you were planning to end the friendship anyway and tend not to feel guilt.  You will love it, I promise.    Things I Don’t Like  • Enterprise Car Rental.  The only good thing about these jackasses is that they do direct billing with State Farm.  This would be the only reason I am still doing business with them, because they clearly don’t know their ass from a hole in the ground.  Not only did they put me in an entirely unclean car this weekend, I have been jerked around by more people from their various Houston offices than one would think reasonably possible.  Watch your back with this group—they’ll screw you up at every turn if you aren’t preternaturally careful (and even then, it won’t be easy).  I’m greatly looking forward to turning this Mercury-piece-of-crap back in, digging up the name of the regional manager, and writing a seething letter of disgust.  Heh.  • Severe weather.  There’s “tornadic activity” headed our way at the moment, and that doesn’t warm my heart.  I swear, around here if it’s not floods or hurricanes it’s tornadoes or mosquitoes with West Nile.  Why, why, why does anyone live here?    • Christmas trees after Christmas.  Is there anything more depressing?  I don’t mean little-Disney-ragamuffins-singing-Britishly depressing, I mean gained-another-dress-size-worth depressing.  Muddy-dog-with-the-homeless-vet depressing.  Grandparents-forget-your-birthday depressing.  Yeesh.  • Overpowering perfume/cologne.  This may affect me more than some, as I have an extremely sensitive sense of smell.  Honestly, when applying any form of personal scent, I think everyone should put a tiny bit under their nose, so they can smell it.  It seems that all too often, people think it’s just not strong enough and want to make sure those in close proximity can smell it.  Man, not only can I smell it, I can taste it—a scenario that should only arise in slightly more intimate situations than standing on the opposite side of the room.  I work with a few people who, I swear, I can smell through the phone.

						   Well, it's time to go wrangle the kids into their carriers and pack them off to their pet "resort" for the week.  It is with no small measure of bravery that I move forth...Phoebe is already on edge because Maxey came home yesterday smelling like the V-E-T after getting his vaccines updated.  All I can say is that the pillowcase trick better not fail me this time.  Due to travel fun, I won't be posting next week.  You may expect a new and fabulous set of lists and other pearls when I return to my computer on the 30th.  Until then, read the archives, eat a candy cane, and have a truly wonderful holiday.   ~Peace on Earth~

						   Stars!  I’ve actually been busy this week.  I guess it goes to show that miracles really do happen in December.  This week, we conquered the sizeable task of getting several hundred Christmas cards out the door.  I think this is some sort of karmic justice for me, since I have never sent more than two or three Christmas cards at a time in my life.  This venture involved taking stacks of cards, signed by my boss (read: his secretary) and stuffing them into envelopes we addressed by hand.  Lord.  Since they were hand-addressed, it wasn’t possible to run them through the automatic sealer thing we have in the mail room.  Luckily, someone produced a gluestick at the crucial moment so we didn’t end up licking any.  That’s really spectacular, because I avoid licking envelopes at all costs.  See, a tech at one of the local emergency rooms told me a story about a patient she had whose lower lip was unbelievably swollen.  When they tried to lance it and nothing came out, they discovered that a few cockroach eggs had ended up in her lip from a papercut she received while licking an envelope.  The eggs had hatched and there were several roaches in larval state living inside her lip.  No joke.    Anyway, here’s the latest installment into the Things I Like/Things I Don’t Like list. Please adjust yourself to this format, as I will be utilizing it often for future entries.  Things I Like • Amy’s Enchiladas.  I hope the kind folks at Whole Foods never tire of seeing me in their checkout lines with a stack of Amy’s Enchiladas in my hands.  These things are like the heroin of yuppie food:  try them once and you’re hooked for all time and eternity.  I’m particularly fond of the cheese variety that comes with corn and refried black beans.    • The staff of the Downtown Post Office.  I’m not sure if it’s a commitment to good service or a continued effort to drop the disgruntled postal employee from society’s cultural memory, but the folks at this branch are downright chipper.  I appreciate this, and I applaud them.   • Gonads and Strife.  If you’ve never seen this lovely little Flash site, you should.  Don’t bother if your computer doesn’t have speakers—it’s the song that will make you laugh to the point of pain. Note: contains a few four-letter words and a few, um, choice pictures from Gray’s Anatomy (hey, you never know what will offend people).  http://www.frashii.com/wldo.swf   • State Farm Insurance.  My agent and all of her staff are extraordinarily kind people.  In the days following my recent vehicular incident, they have been most helpful and have demonstrated legions of patience while I figure out this whole claims process.    • The wonderful staff of Discover Leadership Training.  To avoid all chance of plagiarism allegations, I don’t do ratings on anything in my lists (to see the world’s most comprehensive and hysterically funny collection of ratings, visit the Brunching Shuttlecocks as http://www.brunching.com).  However, I’ll make one exception and give this crowd the highest grade possible—A+, four stars, 10 out of 10…whatever scale you prefer.  They keep my light lit, and there’s very little that tops that.  Noticed the rather profound absence of last week’s general misanthropic haze?  I give significant credit to this past weekend with the Discover crew.  Thanks guys, I needed that.  • Soup spoons.  They are, by far, the cutest utensil.  I actually stole a silver soup spoon from a B&B I used to work at.  Oddly, I never had the nerve to steal it while I worked there but rather when I visited on a trip back to Philly a few years ago.  I keep thinking about sending it back, but I happen to really like it, and I also happen to know that they have upwards of 350 and rarely serve soup.    Things I Don’t Like: • My job.  In case I haven’t mentioned this recently…  (though I am taking strides to remedy the situation—more on this later).   • The smell of money.  I freely admit that I have an extremely sensitive sense of smell, and that I am disturbed by odors that don’t register with many other people.  Still, I challenge anyone to tell me with a straight face that new bills fresh out of a brick from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing smell anything other than awful.  Granted, I probably have more interaction with such bills that most due to my place of employment.  Come on over, we’ll cash a check and you can smell the nastiness, too.  This stands as yet another reason I am in full support of a cashless society.  • Rental car companies.  In the two days following my encounter with the South Loop Enterprise people, I have given great heaps of thanks that the recruiter from Enterprise chose not to hire me when I applied for their management training program in 2001.  Gawd.  Aside from being incredibly schmarmy, the fellow who (at long last) helped me into a 2003 Trailblazer came quite close to earning the Bag of Hair Award for the day (as in, ‘dumb as a…’).  Apparently, no one who has ever rented from them before has been entirely indifferent as to which car they receive.  Usually, I tend to keep my “I just don’t care” commentary to myself, but this situation provoked me to actually say it about a dozen times.  Oy.  • Gender discrimination.  I’d really like to earn as much as one of my (male) colleagues who has yet to graduate from college, works about 5.5 hours a day, and has yet to discover the presence of spell-check.  Not to launch into a feminist fugue here, but really.  It wasn’t until I started working that I realized “little lady” is actually a working part of many people’s (men’s) vocabularies.  The funny part?  I’m not that little.  Go figure.  • The Real World.  I spent many summers absolutely glued to this show.  Now, it just makes me sad, though in a good-grief-ma way rather than a feel-the-pathos-with-me way.  I will probably use hours and hours of footage for research when I write my book about my 50th percentile theory.    • Cottage cheese with fruit.  I’m down with the fruit, I’m down with the cottage cheese.  It’s the combination that makes no earthly sense to me.

						   The holidays are around the corner…and I’m not very excited.  If you could see the gray, rainy yuckness that is surrounding this city right now, you’d have an accurate visual for my general mood.  I’m not even sure what the deal is—it’s not that there’s anything specifically wrong.  I’ve come to know intimate hatred of my job, and that’s probably the biggest life-damper right now.  Faithful readers know that I recently broke up with Boy, and though the relationship was short in tenure, it was long on promise (for me, anyway) and the fact that it didn’t work keeps sneaking up to bite me with big, sad teeth.  Lastly, I went to see a specialist about my back last week—hoping to open big new doors of pain management for the condition that has caused me daily pain for the last few years—only to be told that I should really just exercise more and learn to deal with it. Um…are you kidding?  The largest medical center in the world doesn’t have anything better to offer a 22-year-old in chronic pain than Celebrex and a pat on the head?  Second opinion, please!  Compounding my general blah is the fact that tomorrow is my 23rd birthday.  I just don’t care.  I’ve always been really excited for my birthday—looked forward to it for weeks, planned special days, etc.—and this year it just seems like another day.  23 isn’t an age at which I’ll be taken any more seriously than I am at 22, so who cares?  When I talked to my mom yesterday, she asked when she should call me Tuesday, and it took me more than a few beats to figure out why on Earth she’d be calling in the middle of the week!?!  Finally it hit me (duh, it’s your birthday, moron).    So, I hate to venture into this thought process because it’s rather counter-feminist and that smells bad, but hear me out.  I think a major source of my misanthropic tendencies this year comes from my harshly confirmed single status.  Seriously, I thought about it last night, and I haven’t been really and truly single for my birthday (and my extension, Christmas/New Year’s) since my junior year of high school.  I guess old habits die hard.  That’s not to say that I was always in a good relationship each year (and yes, it was always a different one—never made a relationship last longer than 10 months), but there was always someone occupying my space and time.  Maybe that’s what’s so depressing right now—I don’t even have any prospects.  Short of my briefly-lived fantasies of Ethan Stiefel (dancer with ABT) or Noah Wyle, there’s no one on my radar right now.  It’s one of the unpleasant realities of the “real world” that I’m still coming to grips with 18 months post-college.  Couple a complete lack of preferred-gender interest with a completely under-stimulating and mind-numbing job…and it’s rather bleak.  Please don’t get me wrong; I recognize and am immensely thankful for the outstanding lot in life I’ve been given.  I have, through hard work and gratuitous luck, had and continue to have a very exceptional 22 years on this planet and that’s absolutely nothing to sneeze at.  Everything just looks a little washed out right now.    I’m feeling especially guilty about leaving the cats for Christmas week.  Given that all my friends will also be out of town visiting their families, I’m left with no choice but to board them.  Gawd.  I can’t even board them at my regular vet—I had to be referred to a “pet resort.”  I’m going to pay $26 a day for them to be tucked away in private “kitty suites.”  This is seriously causing me great amounts of anxiety.  One the one hand we have Phoebe, who hates with a fiery passion any and all attempts by humans to take her away from her home and general sense of control.  Seriously, she was named "Meanest Cat in the City” by the folks who spayed her.  These are the people who spay wild animals…yeah, she’s a little on the wild side sometimes.  On the other hand we have Max, whose feline herpes is greatly aggravated by stress and is prone to bouts of abject sadness when I leave him for more than 20 hours.  Basically, I’m going to come home to weepy-eyed puddle of depression and one junior Satan.  And I’m going to pay out the nose for it.  Greaaat.  I feel guilty already.

						   Greetings from the land of boredom and under-appreciation.  For this afternoon’s post, I thought I’d throw out a two-part list called ‘Things I Like’ and ‘Things I Don’t Like.’  Sort of a self-propagated point-counterpoint thing, if you will.  Things I Like • Paula Dorf’s lipstick in “Gilda.”  This is a truly superb color and I pretty much plan to make it my new lipstick staple.  Hell, this could be the thing that puts an end to my incessant lipstick-purchasing compulsion.  Seriously, it’s bad.  I estimate that, at present, I own upwards of 60 shades/variations of lip color.  It’s a truly worthless obsession, but at least it costs less than handbags.  I tend to purchase them on a much slower cycle.  • Benetint, by BeneFit.  Truly amazing stuff here—it really is the sexiest flush you can get in a bottle.  The fact that it smells and tastes like roses is a nice perk, too.  Once in the olden days of my youth I went through a serious rose phase, in which I explored rose-related products in a bevy of incarnations.  I think the low-point was the rose-flavored breath mints.  They tasted like soap, but came in a neat bottle.  What was I thinking?  • Good dates.  Really, is there a better way to spend your time?  A good date can send you into a certain form of euphoria that science has yet to articulate in pharmaceutical form.  I hope they call me when they do, because it would definitely help nullify the yuck from a bad date (more on that later).  • Cheerful cashiers, particularly during the holiday shopping crunch.  I wish all retail employees could summon up a good game face for the brief weeks that precede the winter holidays.  When it’s good, it’s really really good…and when it’s bad, it’s horrid.  • Spell check.  I greatly enjoy any and all automated functions that save me from looking like a complete idiot…or at least from looking like the poor typist I truly am.  • Full tanks of gas.  For some reason, I get a brief but joyous high from knowing that my 19.5 gallon tank is totally full.  There’s always a part of me that thinks, ‘Reno.  We should drive to Reno.’  I have yet to act on it, but it’s only a matter of time.   • A cat under the covers.  Oddly, of my two cats it’s the completely evil one that likes this.  The cuddlier, snuggle-monster Max?  Won’t do it.  He’s a top-of-the-covers-only kind of boy.  Phoebe, also known as Prickles the WonderBitch, has entered this weird phase wherein she absolutely MUST crawl under any blanket that I’m under and lay next to my hip.  That’s not to say that she isn’t extremely fond of biting me while she’s under there, but it’s pretty sweet nonetheless.   • Great fonts.  Doesn’t the simplest of text look so much sexier when it’s written in a completely cool font?  I think it’s why I’m so taken with Calvin Klein underwear.    • Doctor’s appointments that take up the whole morning.  Wednesday, baby, Wednesday!  • White cake with pink frosting.  I have never made a white cake with frosting colored anything but pink and I don’t intend to change that practice.  Ever.  It just works.  Yes, dipshit, I know it tastes the same…or does it?  • The entire Elsa Peretti line at Tiffany.  I own one necklace (the silver bean), and that’s only the beginning.  If anyone is hard-up for a birthday present idea for me, I will gladly accept the Elsa Peretti silver and diamond ring in size 6.    Things I Don’t Like • Colorstay anything.  Let’s face it—it’s really better to have your lipstick wear off completely and hazard reapplication than to be stuck with the mouth of an unfortunate 90-year-old ½ way through your day.  You know it, you’ve been there: cracked, dry, flaking, an odd ring of cakey lipschmutz lining the inside of your lip.  It never works to reapply, so don’t bother.    • Bad dates.  I could actually pull together a nice anthology about this, but I think the interviews would take the rest of my natural-born life.  Wouldn’t you think that most people could dial down the crazy for two hours?  Two hours, I ask you!  To protect the innocent (misguided, perhaps, but still relatively innocent), I will withhold the specific details I have in mind, but gawd.   • Surly salespersons.  Oh, I’m sorry, am I inconveniencing you a great deal by asking where the hell the photo albums are?  This Matrix-like maze of a store you have here is baking my noodle something awful, so please understand that it’s against my better judgement to ask for help.  Please, go back to your absorbing conversation with Wanda about the ever-pressing issue of bangs versus no bangs.  My sincerest apologies.  • Grammar check.  I find great irony and rapture in the fact that the grammar check on this computer chose to underline the title of this bullet with it’s green squiggle of incorrectness.  Ah, the mobius strip of Microsoft logic.    • Cat litter in my bed.  I gave them a doormat to wipe their little paws on after exiting the box, but a few select grains find their way into my bed every day.  Sigh.  • Comic Sans.  This font is hideous and unprofessional.  Why it appears so frequently in the business world continues to baffle me.  People, it’s not cute, so cut it out.    • Thomas Kincaide and all of his “art.”  It’s not art, people, it’s good marketing.  This man and his hideously schmaltzy paintings make me physically ill.  “Likes Thomas Kincaide” appears in the top-5 on my list of Relationship Dealbreakers.  Right up there with declaring Canon in D as your favorite piece of classical music.  Hang on, nausea….overwhelming me…must…find…basin…  • Unnecessary acronyms.  This was a huge problem in college, and it only got worse when I left school for the financial industry.  Not to name names, but here at this country’s central bank, we have more damn acronyms than you can shake a stick at.  When you have to publish an online acronym dictionary, it’s time to admit you have a problem.    • Jennifer Lopez.  I could, in fact, add her to the list of People I’d Like to Kick in the Teeth.  Let me just say this briefly, and we’ll be done.  The woman is absolutely talentless.  She’s a talentless assclown.  She can’t act her way out of a paper bag, can’t sing, and REALLY can’t dance.  As we saw at last year’s academy awards, clearly having more money than God doesn’t mean you can hire a decent stylist.  The dress sucked and didn’t fit, the hair simply defied explanation.  Bottom line: she’s cheesy and I’m sick of her ass face.    I think that pretty much wraps it up for now.  I kind of dig this format, so we’ll probably be seeing more of it in the weeks to come.  Reminder: Boys Are Stupid.

						   I know, I know…it’s been twelve days since my last post, which was merely a rant at that.  Life has managed to take over for a spell, but things are back in balance again and I’m fulfilling my posting duty once more.  But I digress.  Here’s a little-known fact about the White House press office, which makes me really like them.  At the end of the daily White House briefing that they fax to a myriad of endpoints around the globe is a section called “Last Laughs.”  Every day, they publish the political jokes—specifically those about the current administration—from the previous evening’s late night television.  I’m mildly ashamed to admit that it’s the only reason I pay any attention to the briefing—I don’t think I’ve actually read the meaty parts more than twice, and both times were probably motivated by an unusually intense surfeit of boredom.  The Last Laughs are a great read, and it gives you the sense of last night’s late night stuff without having to sit through it.  I’m a big fat fan.  So what’s it like in my world?  My dinner companion of last night posed this question to me midway through our entrees, and I’ve been kicking around the answer since.  I think at the time, I responded that it was bizarre (true) and loud (also true), but I think there’s a lot more to it than that.  I’m really struck by what I would say if I had time to think about my response, and among other things I’d have to answer that it’s lonely—very, very lonely.  I don’t say that to garner sympathy or to complain, because it’s not a condition that I specifically lament.  I think it’s always been that way, because I’ve always been isolated in some way.  I have an uncanny talent for finding people who disappoint, or who desert, but I think it’s more than that.  It seems like I tend to think on a different plane than most people, and that is probably a major source of isolation no matter what your surrounds look like.  Being lonely isn’t always a bad thing, but perhaps I’d say that about anything that’s characterized most of my life.  Funny.  As to how I would characterize the rest of “my world,” that’s going to take some further thought.    I submit the following piece of information into the Ways In Which My Jackass Tendencies Are Self-Destructive file.  Recently, I rather skillfully managed to slice the tip of my own finger with a potato peeler.  Before you offer any sympathy let me clarify that it was while attempting to prove to myself that I can totally peel potatoes with either my right or left hand…you can see where this is going.  In my defense, it was a really small potato, and I peeled over 75% of it before slamming the peeler into the tip of my right index finger.  It bled like a stuck pig and finishing the peeling without bloodying the potato was more than a little tricky.  What can I say—at least I’ve never gotten involved with chainsaw ice sculpting or anything outwardly dangerous like that.  No, I find injury in the most benign of situations.  It’s a talent, really.  A few weeks ago, on my way home from work, I arrived at an intersection near a community college where I make a right turn every night.  I rolled to a reasonable (but not really complete) stop—call it a decent pause—and proceeded to turn.  As I rolled across the crosswalk, a young woman, presumably from the college, began walking across the street about 15 yards in front of my car.  Please note at this juncture that my vehicle was in the process of passing the crosswalk, therefore the woman in front of my car was nowhere near it.  It wasn’t clear whether or not she was going to wait for me to pass before crossing, so I did a little pause-and-go dance and waited for her cue.  Finally she decided to march right across, but not before she pointed aggressively at the intersection behind me and screamed “stop sign!”  Does anyone else find the sweet, sweet irony in the jaywalker criticizing me for failing to come to a complete stop?  Hey, I’m all for stopping at crosswalks, but if there’s one in sight and someone is readying themselves to dart across at another point in the street, I’ll be damned if I’m stopping.  I don’t like to encourage that sort of thing.  It’s like letting people make ridiculous left turns at places or times of day that absolutely warrant a creative right.  I just can’t support that kind of stupidity.  Someday, they’ll probably thank me.  No list today, I promise there will be a good one next week.

						   And so ends another week, which has been surprisingly busy.  Monday was my only obligation-free lunch day, which practically never happens.  Sadly, having lunch appointments every day of the week doesn’t mean a week of great food.  All I can say is that the bar really can’t get much lower for large-event catering in this city.  Twice in one week I found myself a luncheon where I was denied the opportunity for coffee.  The hell?    Anyway, the motivation for this non-Monday post is that there’s a PSA I need to get off my chest (ahem, so to speak).  I can’t for the life of me come up with a truly witty lead-in for this so I’ll just come out and say it.  Men of the world, and particularly this city and even more particularly my workplace...STOP LOOKING AT MY BREASTS.  Good grief guys, they don’t talk, and they aren’t in any danger of falling off my body, so please stop checking in on them.  I am not even close to kidding, this crap is ridiculous.  Yesterday, during a break of the BOARD of DIRECTORS meeting I am required to attend, a rather prominent economist couldn’t even manage to limit the back and forth action between my face and my rack to non-subtle eye movements—there was actual up-and-downage of his head.  For crying out loud, are we in high school?  Actually, I take that back.  You see, I teach test prep classes for high school students and I can say without reservation that the 16-year-olds are significantly less obvious or disgusting about their chest-leering.  It’s truly appalling, and I hate it—particularly in my workplace (where there are unfortunately about four blatant, repeat offenders with whom I interact on a daily basis).  I don’t really get it, either.  Mine are fine, but they aren’t *that* big and certainly not what I would describe as remarkable.  Every other person has them, and to be honest, they’re kind of weird.  But if you find them attractive, hey, that’s your deal…just stare when it’s appropriate and not while I’m talking to you about planning a conference, mmmkay?  Once again, a solid piece of evidence in my Boys Are Stupid file.

						   Happy Monday!  As another week rattles off to a riveting start (cough, sputter, chortle), I continue to ponder the possibility of attending law school.  I’m considering becoming a certified mediator to gain some perspective into conflict resolution and all that jazz.  I think I might actually be quite good at it since the challenge of applying reason and compassion without (or in spite of) emotion appeals to me greatly.  Actually, the continual logic-emotional conundrum of our legal system as a whole fascinates me to death.  I just love the painful challenge of applying black-letter law in a uniform manner—overcoming the urge to bend it in cases that appeal to us emotionally.  The fact that we can only make the system work by applying it to everyone equally is such a bittersweet pain for me, and I love it—like poking at a sore muscle.  It’s hard to explain—a bit too cerebral for me to articulate very well.   I don’t think I’ll do a list this morning—I definitely haven’t been thinking about it for the past few days and therefore don’t have anything rattling in the forefront of my consciousness to deposit into readable form.    My latest guilty pleasure is to watch syndicated episodes of Felicity on WE every night.  One thing I absolutely appreciate about the schedule is that they legitimately air an episode every single evening.  I hate getting attached to a syndicated show during the week and being stranded without it on the weekends.  Okay, okay, so I know that says a great deal about me and my relationship with the 13” box on my dresser, but let’s ignore that for a minute.  I love watching Felicity for several reasons.  1) I stopped watching on a regular basis when I left Bryn Mawr and it’s nice to catch up on what happened to the show.  2) While at Bryn Mawr, I watched it with a wonderful friend (Kateka) rather religiously and seeing reruns brings about all sorts of nostalgia for sitting on the floor of her room on the miserable third floor of Denbigh Hall (commonly knows as Den of Bitches—that was a bad year to say the least).  We would watch and dreamily sigh that that’s what school with boys must be like.  Oh, how wrong we were…well, sort of.  3) And this piggybacks on to the end of number 2—there are many pieces of the show that do, in fact, remind me about many good parts of college, and I miss that.  As much as everyone is sick of school by the time the graduate, I think there’s a certain sense of insulation and timelessness at college that can’t really be duplicated anywhere else.  Even amidst all the growing, the changing, the self-doubting, and the confusion, college felt like one of the safest places I’ve ever been.  4) I take a sick sense of delight and joy is watching the characters make ridiculously bad choices and I shriek at them with unabashed judgement.  What can I say, I love watching people screw things up when there aren’t any consequences.  5) Though there are pieces of the show that bear no witness on anything even remotely resembling reality, the writers actually managed to nail a bunch of things on the head.  I find myself watching and nodding (at least internally) at many of the things the characters experience.  There’s some truth there, though you might have to wade through Keri Russell’s hair to find it.     So if you read this blog on anything like a regular basis (or if you sporadically flip through the archives), you know that I am entirely and unapologetically single right now.  I can’t decide how I feel about that.  On the one hand, it’s fabulous and I am extremely pleased to have nothing in the way of romantic distractions or obligations to clutter this already confusing time.  It’s especially freeing whilst I search for a grad school decision since I can change my plan radically from day to day without feeling like I have to justify my complete about-face to the person on the other side of the bed.  That said, I greatly miss having someone over there.  That’s the funny part—even though I would admittedly love to have someone around to talk with and horse around in the kitchen, it’s the physical contact that I miss the most.  I am a very tactile, kinesthetic person and after all is said and done, I greatly prefer to have someone to drape myself across and just feel.  It’s not even a sexual thing…just tactile.  *Sigh*, yet another thing I can’t really explain.  Sadly, there really isn’t a solution for isolating that need and filling it.  I’ve been there before—Mr. Drama has stayed over for purely close sleeping and it was some of the best sleep I’ve ever had—but I’m pretty sure that was only possible given the long and varied path our relationship has taken.  I think you have to pretty much exhaust any sexual tension that may lie between you before friendly bedfellow situations are possible, and that takes both time and inevitable pain before that point is reached.  Sadly, the recent (arg, not so recent anymore, I guess) introduction of Mr. Drama’s future bride has wholly squelched the possibility of that ever happening again.  I’m still a little skeptical about that whole thing, if you can’t tell.  (See the entry for the week of November 25 for the backstory on Mr. Drama.)  So I don’t know where that leaves me, and that’s probably the most honest and complete statement I can make about the whole relationship issue at this time.  I really don’t know what I want.  That certainly isn’t to say that my ambivalence should be seen as refusal to accept possibilities or opportunities that may present themselves to me.  I guess I’m more in line with entering a We Shall See mindset for the time being.    And see we shall….

						   Monday was several days ago and I’m just now getting to my weekly entry.  Deal with it.  My dad came to town and I was out of the office until yesterday.  We had a super time—no horror stories of any sort to report (and to those of you who were willing it to happen so you’d have something interesting to read, shame on you.)  This week, I’m furtively plugging away at my on-going quest to figure out what the hell I’m going to do with my life.  The current thought is law school.  Okay, okay, stop shouting…it’s just a thought at this point.  Here’s the thing about law school, well, really things since it’s a multi-item list.  1) All I have to do to get ready to go is take an LSAT and fill out the app.  Since I spend a decent amount of time teaching others to beat standardized tests and am rather good at taking them myself, the LSAT isn’t much of an issue.  No additional prerequisites, no gratuitous expanses of time before I could even hope of entering.  2) I am extremely attracted to the idea of putting analytical absolutism into a verbal realm.  Essentially, it would capitalize on many of my strengths, and there’s something really seductive about a field you’d undoubtedly be extremely good at.  3) Piggybacking on number 2, there’s an absurd amount of rote memorization, which is one of my annoying strengths.  At last, something to capitalize on my ability to recall information in excessively mundane detail.  4) Holding a JD elicits the kind of instant credibility and respect that I (sadly) require in my professional sphere.  I could probably convert number 4 into a non-issue with a few months of therapy.   Anyway, we’ll see.  I came across a few books that look like they’ll be helpful reads in determining whether this is the thing for me.  Part of the struggle here is that I’ve always been so diametrically opposed to the idea of going to law school.  I’ve just always thought of it as a big yucky place for yucky people—and definitely not for me.  However, I don’t think I’ve ever really looked beyond the hype and stereotypes to see what law school is really all about and what one can in fact do with a JD (many, many things).  So we’ll see.   Without further ado, here’s the list.  Things I Like • My car.  No, I love my car.  The nice folks at the body shop finished their work and liberated me from rental hell earlier this week.  Not only did they do (as far as I can tell) good work with the repairs, but they did a substantial job of cleaning the car as well.  The exterior is so clean and shiny it looks new, and the interior has been shampooed, vacuumed, deodorized, and armor-alled within an inch of its life.  Seriously, my car hasn’t looked or smelled this good since I bought it.  Welcome home, baby.  • Cooking Light magazine.  I just started getting this, and it’s great.  They have some truly wonderful recipes (although the copy could stand a few more editing passes—some of the writing isn’t all it could be) and a nice variety of complexity.  I’m a fan, a great big fan.  • Borden’s new calcium-enriched milk.  I am shamefully delinquent in my calcium intake, and this is a great answer to my whining about consuming “so much dairy.”  One cup has 45% of my daily requirement.  What an idea!  Seriously, with the technology and resources available to the FDA and various agricultural and nutritional councils, why has it taken this long to reach this result?  It’s laziness, I tell you.  • My mom’s almond roca.  The box of my Christmas overflow came yesterday—I send one to myself from my mom’s house every year filled with whatever doesn’t fit back into my suitcase.  One of the items in this year’s box was a tin full of the almond roca we made while I was home (read: I stood in the kitchen watching rather uselessly as my mom made the candy).  This stuff has heroin-magnitude addictive properties and is without a doubt one of the best comestibles in the history of the world.  Unfortunately, it’s nearly impossible to make on an electric stove so I probably won’t be putting together my own batch any time soon.  I’ll just have to savor and ration this batch as long as humanly possible.  Sigh.  • Orlando Bloom.  Oh my good lord, this man is hot.  In case your connective mind is failing you, he plays Legolas in the Lord of the Rings movies.  Though I admit I find the long blond hair of his elfish character more appealing than his natural dark hair (an odd upset as I’m generally not prone to blondes), I wouldn’t kick him out of bed no matter what his hair looked like.  Sadly, this is one of those celebrity crushes of mine that’s still in the stage of absolutely denying the fact that we’ll never so much as meet.  If anyone knows him, kindly pass along my contact info and be sure to emphasize that I make the world’s best cinnamon rolls.  Who could pass that up?  Things I Don’t Like • The shoes I’m wearing today.  Sometimes cheap shoes are a hit and sometimes they’re a miss.  These are a miss.  They were certainly cheap, and I suppose when I bought them that I was hoping they’d be another frugal hero much like the other pair from the same brand has been.  I was sadly mistaken.  They’re a smidge too tight, they make an odd squeaking feeling when I walk (though surprisingly not a sound), and the angle/placement of the heel makes me feel like I’m always slightly off-balance and should therefore step with caution.  Not a good choice.  • The sound of fingernails being trimmed.  One would think that this wouldn’t really be an issue for me at all, since I don’t live with anyone and it isn’t an activity people normally conduct in the workplace.  Sadly, the bounds of normalcy don’t apply to my workplace.  The manager who sits behind me was clipping his nails about half an hour ago, and I’m still aghast.  Are you kidding me with this crap?  • Paying bills.  This is why I need a husband, seriously.  I can’t even tell you why I hate paying bills and dealing with balancing my checkbook, but I do.  Having someone else to pass that task to is one of the shining advantages I see to marriage.  That, and gift registry.  • My job, and many of the people who work here.  Let me just say this: incompetence coupled with ambition is a dangerous, smelly thing.

						   Today is definitely gearing itself to be a contender in the top ten slowest days ever.  I think I’ve been here at my desk for just about an eternity, clearly longer than a workday, yet it isn’t even four yet.  Amazing.  I think I’ve aged markedly in what the clock claims to be the last three hours.  More like three days, if you ask me.  Actually, this rate of aging is pretty good, because I’ll be able to swing by the post office on my way home to drop of my application for Medicare as I will clearly be past retirement age by five o’clock this evening.    Last night I saw a local commercial for a restaurant in a neighboring suburb.  It wasn’t bad, as local spots go (though I still stand firmly against the entire practice of people writing and producing their own ads) until they aired the name of the restaurant: “The Potatoe Patch.”  It’s been about 18 hours and I’m still speechless.  Yet another sign that I should really get the lead out on launching my CompetencyNow! campaign.  You know what I’m really sick of?  White male privilege.  Or perhaps, more specifically, the sense of entitlement our society has bestowed upon men, mainly white men but not exclusively, for centuries.  To be fair, I should probably note that this isn’t a problem limited exclusively to Western society—take a looksie at really every major civilization since, well, ever and you’ll find a bevy of problems that are essentially rooted in the struggles of men whose sense of entitlement has been infringed upon.  The short version of this phenomenon can generally be termed “Boys Are Stupid,” because that’s pretty much what it comes down to.  I guess I wouldn’t take such issue with this whole problem if the typical response pattern didn’t involve a) expressing oneself through violence and/or vandalism, b) pouting, moodiness, and general obstinacy, c) moral indecency such as theft, adultery, and other sundry corruption, and d) the transferring of blame and responsibility for the issue in question to whatever woman happens to be in range.  Though I adamantly contend that women can be unseasonably obnoxious to deal with in times of ire, I have to say that I really prefer the self-loathing/take things personally approach to the male invective.  I guess it’s a personal preference thing, really.  What exactly is it that has prompted men from the dawn of time to prove about themselves?  I just don’t get it.  Relax, guys—the neurotically domineering thing is far less attractive than you think.  And misogyny? I don’t think so.    Totally unrelated, my dad is coming to town tomorrow.

						   Yeah…so I never got around to posting last week.  I tell you, those Monday holidays are nice but they sure screw up the rest of my week.  Then again, I’ve had trouble keeping track of what day it is since about Thanksgiving, so that’s probably a pretty invalid excuse.    I just noticed that my desk chair makes an inordinate amount of squeaking and creaking as I shift around in it.  It’s probably always been there, but I’ve successfully blocked it out until now.  I wonder if it’s a source of intense annoyance for those around me…  Have you ever been at a crossroads in a friendship—when you come to realize that, despite a long and varied history, it’s time to cut someone loose?  I’m there, and it’s bizarre.  For reasons I don’t know (but can probably guess), one of my formerly nearest and dearest friends has all but disappeared—or at least has suspended all contact.  There was no fight, no incident, nothing, which is probably why this feels so un-final.  He’s just…gone, and it’s time for me to accept that and, in my own way, say goodbye.  It might not be a permanent farewell, but it’s necessary now.  So, goodbye, Mr. Drama—I hope you chose things that make you happy, and I hope the things that make you happy choose you.  Fare thee well.  At times like this, a good croissant would go a long way towards, well, I’m not sure what.  There’s really not a lot that’s wrong at the moment (and a few things that are substantially right!), so I’m not talking culinary therapy or anything.  Still, something with an overwhelmingly high butter content would be pretty fab right about now!  No list today—my little brain is a little empty.

						   Check it out…I’m actually posting on a Monday!  This isn’t the longest list I’ve ever posted, but it’s here and it’s on time, which has to be worth something.    Things I Like  • Hans Blix.  Actually, I haven’t completely formed my opinion one way or another on Mr. UN Inspector…but I really and truly dig his name.  Hans Blix…say it, you’ll feel nifty.  Hans Blix!  Some people have those names you just want to shout—I had a professor once named Heghnar Watenpaugh, which you should definitely shout in some fashion before the end of the day.  It’s pronounced exactly as it looks, and it’s very conducive to bellowing.  Go, shout it now.  • The Anna Nicole Show.  I am so guilty of loving this show I can hardly stand it.  Reality television, in general, bores me to tears.  Recently, however, I have made two reluctant exceptions to my opinions on RTV—The Anna Nicole Show and Joe Millionaire (I know, I know!).  To be honest, I can’t completely make myself watch and entire episode of Anna Nicole, because I reach breaking point with her vapid sluggishness pretty quickly…yet something always pulls me back.  It’s kind of like slowing down to see the car accident, getting grossed out, then circling back around the block for another look in spite of yourself.  Whatever it is, I can’t stop watching.  They’re airing a live episode on March 2, and if you think I’m not going to tape it, you’d better think again.    • Solid perfume.  You’ve seen it—looks like a tiny little deodorant stick you rub on your neck and wherever else you normally apply fragrance.  Though it can be difficult to find your favorite scent in this form, it’s pretty awesome when you can—the intensity stays constant for several hours (much longer than anything liquid) and it tends to leave tiny little shimmery bits all over your skin.  Not tacky, please-cleanse-thyself-Tinkerhell glittery, mind you, but nicely subtle sparkle.  A glow, if you will.  • Direct deposit.  I’m actually required by my primary employer to utilize this banking function, and I couldn’t be happier.  Seriously, is there anything that gives you the same unique sense of both security and glee than looking at the clock late Thursday night and knowing your paycheck just showed up in your account—in its entirety?!  No effort, no deposit slip…just the blind faith that your money is going to be there.  Yes sir, I love me some direct deposit.    • Lemony Snicket.  I know, I know, another cool name, but I can’t resist.  I have come to understand that this is actually a pseudonym of a children’s author named Daniel Handler (which, come to think of it, is a pretty cool name in and of itself).  Though I think Lemony Snicket is an absolutely smashingly wonderful name, I can’t help but imagine what an even better pastry it would be.  I can stand here today and say with complete certainty that I would order anything called a Lemony Snicket off any menu, regardless of the description.  It’s pure naming genius, and it sounds like it would be highly agreeable to any form involving a buttery crust.    • Federal holidays.  Working at an institution that follows the federal holiday schedule really bites you in the ass around Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Easter…but you come out even in random three-day weekends for holidays you wouldn’t normally observe.  Seriously, Columbus Day?  Never gave it a thought before, now I actively look forward to the second Monday in October.  This Monday is President’s Day, and I’ve got a full day’s worth of vegetating penciled in.    Things I Don’t Like  • Baby’s Breath.  Why is the industry standard for floral arrangement filler so unbelievably tacky?  Truly, you can take a perfectly wonderful grouping of flowers and greenery and turn it into cheesy shit by adding a few sprigs of baby’s breath.  It’s fugly, and there are a ziptillion alternatives.  If I could find a florist who refused to stock baby’s breath and consequently used any of the other triptillion options of filler, I would make them my one and only floral supplier.    • Ridiculous overreactions to cold weather.  Stop the presses, the temperature approached freezing here this weekend.  For some reason, this caused residents of this fine city to lose all sense of reason and accountability and take undue extreme measures to “protect” themselves.  Seriously, my apartment complex posted signs all over the place (huge, red signs) that read: “FREEZE WARNING! Drip faucets! Set thermostat to 65!”  Jebus, people, I spent the first 17 years of my life in places with legitimate cold and not ONCE did we drip our faucets to prevent frozen pipes.  Really, for pipes to freeze, you have to have a) an actual hard freeze that more than makes a gentle gesture in the 32-degree range, and b) it has to happen pretty fast.  Yikes.  • The Two-Week Freakout.  Unfamiliar with this concept?  Clearly you haven’t dated men under 30 in recent memory.  I’ll come back to the logic behind my age-bracketing here in a minute, but let me first explain this horrific phenomenon.  The Two-Week Freakout (TWF) is the unfortunate event that inevitably occurs after two weeks or so of dating someone new.  I’ve heard legends of women initiating it, but I think they might be pure rumor.  In my experience, after two weeks (or 3-4 dates, give or take), a sudden and unexplained distancing occurs.  At some point, this is followed by a bullshit conversation about “not wanting a relationship” and “needing to take time for [the speaker]” or possibly “you’re really great, but I don’t want to give you any false expectations.”  It’s entirely possible to smooth past the TWF, but its occurrence definitely dials up the crazy in any relationship, and that’s garbage.  Also, it strikes me as entirely lame that these boys, er, men, never seem to think for a *moment* that at least *some* of the women out there aren't wanting to define a Relationship after two weeks.  Yeesh, calm the hell down, guys, some of us would just like to see where it goes. Okay, back to my age bracketing—I can say with certainty that this occurs regularly and reliably with men under 30.  I’m furtively hoping it’s something they eventually grow out of, but time will tell.  Maybe less time than one would think…oh devil! I’ve said too much!     That wraps up this week’s list.  I’m loosely thinking about a Friday wrap-up for the week, but we’ll see how things go.  May your week be delightful and your metabolism speedy!

						   **********BONUS MATERIAL********** In addition to today's normal post of this week's list (see below), I'm adding a special essay that has been in the works (and admittedly on the backest of back burners) for several months.  I'm so damned glad about having finally forced myself to finish it that I can't wait to post the thing.  Here it is, approximately a year in the works if you can believe it.  I am a slacker of unprecedented proportions.  *** Ridiculous Things You’d Think a Quality Education Would Enable You to Outsmart: The Lies and Trickery of Victoria’s Secret A Tragedy in Two Acts  ~I~ This story begins with a wholly mediocre dress.  Highly decent fabric and color, but primarily shapeless due to the lack of fitting necessary to accommodate the complete absence of a zipper or other such closure device.  Picture the final project you might have attempted in 9th grade Advanced Apparel Construction, then imagine it falling into the boundaries of acceptable fit and showing up on the rack at Burlington Coat Factory for $17 a week before your company’s Christmas Dinner/Dance.  I admit, it’s not bad looking, and I bought it as a backup.  Having very little time to shop during the week, this was like my second string quarterback: not the first choice by any means, but sure to deliver an adequate performance if needed.  And cheap, which is a crucial detail to this story.    Further attempts to displace the backup dress with a first-string, above average, I-really-and-truly-like-it dress were entirely futile, which I could accept since purchasing formal dresses is generally a task requiring a significant time investment.  The Dress Formerly Known As Backup (DFKAB) has “spaghetti straps” and thus requires something other than my favorite black Calvin Klein bra underneath.  It needs, in fact, something strapless and preferably backless.  My experience with strapless-backless bras is less-than-positive….I think.  I have blocked out a few horrific experiences relating to hideous strapless dresses I was forced to wear in my community theatre days…there were weird straps around my waist and great quantities of boning, which just sounds wrong.  Anyway, I remembered Heather, my college roommate from junior year, and her rave reviews of what can only be appropriately called “sticky boobs.”  Why the hell not?  I stumbled into Victoria’s Secret, mumbling to myself different versions of how I might ask “hey, do you have those sticky boob things?” in different terminology.  Thankfully, before I could find someone to ask, I found a display of various support devices that utilize adhesives of some kind.  I really and truly intended to select one without the help of a VS sales associate, but the options were many and varied—far surpassing my decision-making skills.    “Caitlynn” and I debated the merits of two styles: individual, sticky, butterfly-looking things, and a more structured option.  The latter was essentially a sturdy pushup bra minus a back and straps.  It adhered to one’s body with a series of adhesive strips.  Hrmm…that seemed like it was asking to fall off and land around my feet.  The first option seemed completely helpful—just peel off the backing and apply!  The picture on the package showed smooth, flawless, strapless, backless support.  I was sold—especially since the sticky butterflies came in a pack of TWELVE, so I had plenty to practice with, and was about a third the cost of the sturdy thing.    ~II~ I made my merry way home, VS bag in hand and a sparkle in my eye.  Hey, if these worked, why not use them for other occasions when straps would be tacky?  This was sheer engineering genius and I was thrilled at the prospect of a dry run.  Oh folly, what a ruthless game you play.  Standing in front of the mirror, I shed my shirt and bra and grabbed the first sticky boob.  The instructions were simple enough: “Remove adhesive backing.  Apply by starting at centre and smooth outwards.”  More pictures of smooth support perfection…I was convinced all over again.  I removed the backing…wait, it stuck to my fingernails.  Unstick, unstick, unstick…success.  I now held a slightly rumpled but fully usable sticky boob.  I started at the, um, middle, and tried smoothing outward.  Yeah, nowhere near as easy as it sounds.  I ended up with a very itchy, very wrinkly, and completely unsupported left side.  Determined to conquer this sticky beast, I tried again on the right—this time pulling up more as I smoothed.  Though the second attempt yielded slightly better support, the visual was NOTHING like the picture of smooth perfection on the package.  Instead, I looked like the victim of an extremely unfortunate grease fire.    I threw on the DFKAB to see what they looked like under the garment in question.  Further disaster.   Not only was I shamelessly un-supported on both sides (the progress made on the right was clearly not sufficient), the edges stuck out more than a little. Gross.  Now I looked like the aforementioned burn victim trying to cover up my hideous scars and head out for a night on the town—in a cheap, untailored dress.  Giving up for the night, I decided to remove the sticky boobs.  This heralded the next problem of rather gargantuan proportions.  Not only was there no way to pull them off that minimized pain, but it soon became evident that my general sensitivity to adhesives was in no way overlooked by this product.  Blinking back tears, I pulled them both off and looked at my reflection in horror.  Where the wrinkly, burn-like surface had been now appeared as a splotchy, irritated mess.  Think of allergic reaction hives, but angrier.  Fed up for one night, I wadded up both stickies and gave them to the cat to play with.    ~Epilogue~ Between the night of the disastrous first run and the night of the actual event in question, I attempted two or three more trials that resulted in varying degrees of success.  By the time the crucial Saturday night rolled around, I had pretty well mastered the lift-and-smooth technique.  Okay, at least it wasn’t the train wreck I started with.  I did, in fact, wear a pair of sticky boobs to the Holiday Dinner thing.  I’m sure it was better than nothing, but not by much.  Since a group of us went out for drinks afterwards, it was a good 6 hours from the time I got dressed to the time of sticky boob removal.  Thankfully I was more than feeling the effects of the aforementioned post-fete drinks, so I have remarkably little memory of the removal process.  There were most certainly remnants of rash the next morning.    To compound the moronic agony of this whole experience, I should confess that I wore one of the remaining pairs of sticky boobs to the same event the following year (2002).  Clearly, I didn’t learn anything from the previous year’s hell, because I went into the whole deal all over again thinking it wasn’t a bad idea.  The dress was substantially better, but completely backless.  I probably could have gotten away with wearing nothing underneath it, since it was fairly well lined and rather fitted, but where’s the fun in that?  Of course, by fun I mean the kind of fun involved in taking out one’s own gallbladder with a spoon, but who’s counting?  I, for one, am far too busy repeating the cycle of stupidity programmed for me by Victoria and her rotten, rotten secrets.

						   I promised last week that a good list would be forthcoming.  I’ve been kicking ideas around in my head ever since, and have in deed produced a list…though its quality is a fairly subjective thing, so please bear with me.  As a side note--I have no idea what's going on with my archive list.  I know it would make sense for things to be listed in chronological order, but that doesn't seem to be in my control.  I think it's all there...but you never know.  Anyway, here's the list without further ado!  Things I Like  • Dreams about food.  I had an exceptionally vivid dream last night about some really spectacular food.  Is there a better way to ear?  Seriously, give it some thought—the options are essentially limitless, it’s probably going to be of exquisite quality, and there’s absolutely no nutritional/metabolic consequences whatsoever.    • People who kiss with purpose.  What a way to make you smile a little more and walk a little taller.  I have someone specific in mind here…hopefully he knows who he is and recognizes this for the shout-out I’m intending it to be.  • Hotel sales and catering management.  If I weren’t an inherently honest person, I would seriously consider making up a few business cards with a legit-sounding business name and a dedicated cell number on them.  I’d then make periodic rounds through this city’s hotels, claiming to be shopping around for a rooming block proposal.  Seriously, nothing makes sales persons pay attention faster than a prospective customer looking for a place to park a few grand in revenue.  Luckily, my current job allows me the opportunity to do this in a legitimate fashion, and as a consequence I have enjoyed several hours of small talk over lovely hotel food in the past several months.  I don’t think enough people realize that there are some truly fantastic restaurants in the above-middle-market hotel arena.  Of course, it’s much more fun to eat there when you’re a client.  In general, the better hotels in a major city do a pretty good job of hiring fun people for their main sales positions.  Bottom line: they’re paid to be exceedingly friendly, and it’s a fun ride.  • Cold milk.  I went through a bizarre lactose-intolerance phase, and it seems that I have fully recovered.  I managed to completely forget how great milk tastes, and it’s been an awesome rediscovery process.  I am ridiculously easily amused.   Things I Don’t Like  • Construction.  I know, I know…I live in the wrong city.  It’s a good thing I drive an SUV, because my daily commute through downtown would inflict serious damage to the suspension of anything smaller.  One of these days, I swear I’m going to see a Hyundai disappear into a pothole and never come out again.  Then all the other drivers will pause for a moment out of respect for our fallen road companion, then we’ll press on regardless.  • Monsters in the closet.  No, silly, not the kind I was afraid of when I was four…the kind we all have lurking about beneath the sunny displays we so skillfully project 99% of the time.  Some people call them skeletons, but I think whomever coined that phrase must have had an uneventful upbringing.  Granted, everyone has issues, and in some ways I think the sooner we recognize the common ones (trust, commitment, blah blah blah) and lower the drama at tad, the less BFD (big fucking deal) it will all seem.  But…what about the honest-to-goodness BFDs?  When do you have The Conversation with people close to you?  It never gets easier, and the anticipation process when I realize I need to say something doesn’t ever seem to lessen in intensity.  No matter what the ubiquitous ‘they’ will say, striking the balance between effectively communicating pertinent details about a former BFD and heightening it into a federal case is tricky.  Nondisclosure is always an option, but also a risky little game.  You just never know when someone will (unknowingly) say or do something that triggers you into a bad place and all of a sudden your BFD talk has become unavoidably necessary and you’re upset about it to boot.  What a crock.  Maybe someone should develop a line of t-shirts with customizable placards we could all use to broadcast our respective BFDs to the general population.  We’d certainly demystify a lot of things…  • Soy milk.  In general, I’m a huge fan of soy products, but I can’t get behind this one.  Perhaps I’d feel differently if people didn’t insist on using it as a substitute for regular milk.  Folks, get a clue: it tastes NOTHING like regular milk, and it never will.  I found this out the hard way, and ruined several cups of great coffee attempting to convince myself otherwise.  It’s undeniable, even to soy milk fans I know, that this stuff tastes markedly nutty.  I can’t think of any circumstance where I would actively choose to make my coffee taste nutty…nope, can’t do it.    • Taxes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that there are very few people who enjoy our method of taxation.  In the past, I’ve always been a fan since they pay for so many things we all use on a daily basis.  This is, however, the first year I will end up owing taxes instead of getting a refund, so I’m a little bitter.  Note to readers: change your W-4 at your primary job when you acquire a second source of income.  It didn’t even occur to me when I started my teaching gig, and I’m it’s going to bite me in the ass come April.  Sigh.  • Obligation gifts.  We have more wedding and baby showers around here than I can possibly count, and we’re all pretty much socially required to contribute towards departmental gifts.  Bless these people and their life events, but I’m a little tired of the bi-weekly baby shower wallet drain.  This morning, my department was shaken down for not one but two shower gifts.  Gawd, people, enough with the babies.  When was the last time we had a cool-single-person-who-would-totally-love-some-new-dishes shower?     Along the same lines as obligation gifts, I give you… Things I Have Conflicted Feelings About  • Valentine’s Day.  It’s a nice idea, really and truly, but I hate the way it makes people feel obligated to go through cheesy rituals they wouldn’t choose otherwise.  V-day is one of the few times I feel legitimately sorry for men in particular, because I think they carry the heavier end of the guilt/obligation knapsack here.  I’m thinking back to one particularly awkward February 14 my senior year of college.  I had been randomly seeing someone for a few months, but we had actually gotten to a place of really not liking each other than much and spent markedly little time together.  In all honesty, I think we were both looking forward to things fading politely away.  Unfortunately, Valentine’s Day came along, and poor Ethan felt the need to send me flowers.  Arg…I have no idea what possessed him.  To compound things, the florist he used ended up being oversold, so they couldn’t deliver on time. In case you’ve never had a problem getting flowers on Valentine’s Day, you should know that florists take that very seriously and issue many, many apologies—all of which confirm that the sender did not, in fact, forget to order your flowers on time.  I’m not kidding, I received two emails, three phone calls, a handwritten note, and a certified letter…all telling me how sorry they were to have screwed up my delivery and that I should, in no way, blame Ethan for their tardiness.  Ever wanted to take a mildly weird situation and pump the awkward factor up by about seven magnitudes?  This would be a great approach.  When they finally surfaced, they were lovely…but I felt really bad that he felt obligated to send them.    Thus I conclude this week’s list.  Until next week, keep your heads up and your coffee hot.

						   Greetings, campers.  I am returning to my (self-imposed) Monday posting-mandate.  Since I skated out of last week without any gesture towards a list, I feel strongly compelled to post one now.  I haven’t been kicking around much in the way of material for this list, so I have no idea what direction it will take.    Things I Like  • The recently-renovated fitness center at my apartment.  It finally occurred to someone that there may, in fact, be a better use for the space neighboring the fitness center than a racquetball court.  Seriously, who were they kidding with that?  Every time I went to use the elliptical runner (okay, both times I went) I was struck by the uncanny feeling that I had somehow become a stockbroker in the mid-80s and that I should do a line of cocaine at my earliest convenience.  Thankfully, I was never swayed.  Anyway, now we are sans racquetball court—and we have those crazy wonderful treadmills/runners/bikes with the personal flat-screen TVs mounted on them.  Oh, how sweet it is.  • My job.  No, not really, but that’s what they want me to say.  • Uni-ball Vision Elite pens in blue-black.  Though the actual writing utility of this pen isn’t my absolute favorite, the ink is second to none.  It’s truly the perfect colour—muted but exciting, if that makes sense.  It inspires within me an odd feeling of tranquility tempered by the extreme urgency to write something down.  Weird, eerie, but very fun.  • Hot and Sour soup.  I have no idea why I’ve been an Egg Drop Soup-only girl for this long.  On a whim, I added a container of Hot and Sour to my Chinese takeout order on Friday night and I damn near licked it clean.  I’ll admit without shame that I ended up going back last night for another quart.  • The word ‘payola.’  The actual definition of this word is nowhere near as fun as what I think it sounds like—a slang term for money someone owes you.  For example: “We refused to finish the job until he forked over the payola, man.”  Its use is greatly enhanced by slyly rubbing one’s fingers together and drawing out the vowels of the word.  Give it a whirl—go ahead, your coworkers totally aren’t looking.   Things I Don’t Like  • Waiting.  One of my most unfortunate weaknesses is my intense lack of patience.  I know, I know: patience is a virtue, virtue is a grace—put them both together and they make a smiling face.  Yeah, well, there are times when I need a little more than a graceful, smiling face to dial down the crazy.  I’m working on it, really I am.  • Born-again ex-smokers/dieters. I myself have now counted two months and four days of being smoke-free and I have dieted off and on for the past four or five years, so I am at full liberty to make experiential comment on the behaviors inherent to both groups here. When people decide to make a life-choice for themselves, I applaud them and support their efforts.  What I can’t stand is the unsolicited proselytizing the born-agains feel compelled to disperse amidst the as-yet unconverted.  People, lay off—if I feel like having a second piece of cake, I’m going to have my fucking cake regardless of how many goddamn points it’s worth in your Weight Watchers handbook.  The thing I really love about their whole points thing (and I speaking specifically about the community of Weight Watchers with whom I currently work) is that they act as though I give a shit about how many points something is worth.  I promise, I don't.  Not one bit.  Then there's the born-again ex-smokers like NYC Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who recently (and successfully) advocated the passage of a city ordinance banning smoking in all bars.  Smoke-free bars in New York?  What is this world coming to.....  • Vacuuming.  Once again, a place where having a husband would be highly useful, as I could completely pawn this off on him in exchange for, say, laundry and dishes.  As the cats are still woefully without opposable thumbs or sentience, I really don’t have anyone to bargain about chores with.     Yikes…so this was quite possibly the shortest and fluffiest list I’ve ever posted.  Fuck that noise, it’s here on Monday…and that’s an accomplishment in and of itself.

						   Ahem.  Greetings…and apologies.  I have no idea why I haven’t written anything for the past month.  Sometimes it be that way, I suppose.  Anyway, here I am, renewing my commitment to post on a semi-regular basis…furtively hoping my absence hasn’t drive away my entire audience.  Such is life.  Have you ever had one of your habits held up before you as being weird or different, but you never would have known it was outside the norm if someone hadn’t told you?  I recently went through this experience, though I’m more amused than scarred.  Backstory: a friend of mine broke her arm pretty badly a few weeks ago—needed surgery with plates, pins, the whole enchilada.  As her healing process progressed, we were talking about the ways in which she’s had to readjust her daily routine to compensate for the screwed up arm.  She said the toughest thing was hooking her bra, and we had all sorts of laughs about the funny ways she might get around it (I keep advocating using tape and the wall, but she thinks that has more potential for disaster than the benefits could possibly justify…potato, potahto).  Finally, I asked her what method she had settled on as the “way to hook a bra when you are physically incapacitated,” and she said she hooked it in front down around her waist and flipped it around.  This gave me great pause, since that’s the way I’ve done it since my first bra in the eighth grade!!!  Holy crap!  I was dumbfounded (well, for a moment—it was followed by gales of laughter that nearly made me choke on my pasta) to find out that my way isn’t the way everyone does it.  In the past, whenever I saw a woman on TV or in a movie hook it in back after putting her arms through the straps, I pshawed and said “No one really goes to all that awkward trouble—hook the dam thing where you can see it.”  Wrong.  I was apparently wrong beyond any shadow of recognition.  Since this revelation, I have polled several of my female friends, and ALL of them hook their bra in back.  So…I guess I’m weird.  (Surprise!  I’ll have to admit here that this was not, in fact, the critical piece of evidence to hit that point home…)  Alright…since I’ve been a big fat slacker for an entire month, here’s a list.  Things I Like:  • The new episodes of South Park.  I stopped watching this show for a long time because I though they were getting a little stale with some of the plots.  I think it was more a case of feeling a little restricted by their consciences, which is apparently no longer an issue as the episodes are more offensive than ever.  The writers may be going to hell with one-way, non-stop tickets, but they make me laugh to the point to pain, so I’m for it.  • Crazy people.  They make me feel ever so much more sane, and for that I am eternally grateful.    • Springtime in Houston.  Though I’m sadly and acutely aware that this won’t last, and that it’s a slippery slope from this point to the hot-as-balls misery of a Houston summer, current weather conditions are exquisite.  It’s one of the few things I really and truly like about living here.  Things I Don’t Like:  • This war.  Just can’t get behind the whole violence thing—and the couple hundred civilian casualties to-date certainly confirms my disgust.  I’m also extremely sick of people who support this war exacting such a strong invective against people who don’t.  Is it really so difficult to comprehend that some of us just don’t support an action at a) has changed its thesis on a bi-weekly basis, b) has essentially rendered the efficacy of the UN Security Council to that of a spider plant, and c) continues to yield an increasing body count of CHILDREN?!?  If someone can explain to me with any semblance of logic or reason how a child whose foot was just blown off by a U.S.-launched weapon is experiencing greater freedom than before?  Didn’t think so.  • Orange juice.  I can’t remember if I’ve said this before, and I don’t really feel like looking through my archive to find out.  I made my mom pretty sad when I told her a few weeks ago that I don’t like orange juice—she realized that she has been offering me something I don’t like every time I have had breakfast at her house for pretty much my entire life.   I guess it’s good that I came clean now, rather than twenty years down the road.  This is another one of those elements of the American canon of stuff you should enjoy that I happen to not.  Sorry folks, it’s right up there with The Beatles, Grease (musical or movie), and Rold Gold Pretzels.    • Eminem.  Sorry, can’t buy the “genius” classification no matter how hard MTV wants to convince me.  I’m not a fan of espousing hate in any medium, but I’m especially dismayed by the marketing machine behind this angry little man that has made his brand of hatred really, really popular with Youth of America.  I know that by typing this, I am rocketing myself squarely into the realm of old people who shake their finger at those darn kids, but I don’t care.  I think he brings ugliness to the world and it makes me kind of sad.  I saw a special about Mr. Mathers on VH1 the other day (shut up—you do so watch it when there’s nothing else on) and in every shot he was always sullen, and often flipping off the camera.  How. Original. How. Brilliant.  I wish I had thought of such a rich and insightful way to express myself.  Oy.  Sigh…not much of a list.  I will put some decent though into one over the weekend and write something of substance on Monday.  Promise.  No, really.

						   Yeah, I haven't posted in a million zillion years....and this isn't going to be a big one to make up for the past several months.  I'm really only posting at present to ask a simple question of whatever I have left of a readership:  What is WRONG with boys?  Seriously, What.  The.  Hell.

						   Sometimes, the greatest literary pearls pop up in everyday conversation.  I have to log this one, because someday I'm going to work it into a great essay, play, or other bit of genius prose.  "You took up smoking, I took up Mormonism...everyone tries ill-advised things when they're young."  Seriously, someday I will parlay that into something that smacks of genius.

						   I sent the link to this blog to a bunch of new folks this week, so perhaps I'll revive my posting habits.  The frequency with which I posted during the last half of 2003 is pretty sad, but sometimes that's how it goes.  As my voice mail says, you'll just have to keep livin' your life.  Wouldn't it be helpful if people would wear teeshirts that told you on sight what sort of person you're about to meet?  Think about it...you pass someone on the street or meet a new person in the office and BOOM! You know what you're getting!  Bitch with Sporadic Pushover Tendencies.  Slacker who Drools Absentmindedly.  Asshat, Through and Through.  See how helpful that would be?  Think about this the next time you encounter someone who does something awful.  Something offensive or in mindnumbingly poor taste.  Think beyond your boiling blood and realize that, in effect, they've just put on their shirt.  Their Asshole Shirt.  Then thank them.

						   A few truths for a Thursday (NOT in order of priority):  1) I do *not* want to teach tonight.  Not. One. Bit. 2) I am freaking out about finding a place to live in Ann Arbor for the fall. 3) The word of the day is Pete, and that makes all things substantially better.  Re: the first item....I'm kind of sleepy and definitely not in the mood for the Herculean labor it takes to get the Thursday kids to understand things.  Maybe I'll let them out early.  Re: the second item...I know this is totally doable, really.  I'm going to let myself have a little flip out time today and that will be the end of it.  Sheesh, this take-responsibility-for-your-own-life crap is a lot simpler when you start a decent-paying job in the city where you went to undergrad and everything just sort of falls into place.  Ah, well...people do cross-country moves every day, and so can I.  Re: the third item...how lucky am I?  Very.  How happy am I?  More than I know how to describe intelligently.  During a delightful conversation this morning over eggs, bacon, bagels, and espresso, I thought to myself "how is this possible?  How did I find myself looking across the table at someone so amazingly awesome?"  I don't know, but I it's been the best surprise to come my way in a looooong time.  Life is awesome, stressors and all.    In addition to the awesomeness that is Pete, there's nothing like a chocolate chip cookie the size of your head to make things seem a little bit incredible.  Damn, those are some good cookies.

						   I used leverage as a verb yesterday, and now I feel unclean.  Ewwww....how could I?  In the April 20, 2003 list of Things I Don't Like, I discussed my dislike for Eminem and made a few derogatory comments about the nonexistent levels of his genius.  The time has come for me to amend such statements.  It's not that I particularly like his stuff, but I have a new appreciation for him and his brethren of flow.  Recently, I attempted to write my own rap as part of a battle rap mishmash of sorts on the UCB.  Whoa, dude, waaaaay harder than it looks.  Both the rhymes and the flow were extremely tough to eek out.  It took me about an hour to write, like, 25 lines, and they weren't very good.  Funny, but not so good.  Mr. Mathers, I find your attitude relatively distasteful but marvel at your skill.  Sir, my hat is off to you.  It's a cliche and a half, but I will attest once again that sometimes the coolest things happen to you when you aren't looking.  I mean, one day you're coming home from a run and accept a last-minute invite to join a group for dinner...and end up meeting someone really and truly awesome.  I don't know what I did to deserve the past weekend, but it was off the charts.  Thanks, universe, I needed that.

						   Sometimes I watch The West Wing to get excited about my own job.  In a sad, sad stretch of my overexuberant imagination, I like to think that the staffers on that show are in some way similar to me in my day job.  I’m wrong, of course, but sometimes it helps me feel charged about being a handler.    Then again, sometimes it just depresses me.  Why can’t I work for Martin Sheen?  My mom saw him in the airport once.  She was heading back to Billings whence…I don’t remember.  Martin Sheen was at a neighboring gate, checking in.  Mom just sat there, but another passenger from her flight went running up to get an autograph.  It was this woman who works in a consignment shop in Billings, and we’ve always thought she was weird beyond words.  She always call my mom and me “girls” when we shop there, which just pisses me off.  Dude, my mom has been 49 for the last 6 years…she’s not a girl.  And quite frankly, neither am I.  Whatev.  Anyway, Crazy Consignment Lady runs up to Martin Sheen to get an autograph, but doesn’t have any paper (aren’t we in an airport?  I love that the Delta people just stood there and didn’t offer anything to write on) so she pulls out a book and has him autograph inside the front cover.  Except it’s not just any book, it’s her Bible.  From now through the end of time, her progeny will cherish the Martin Sheen Bible.    Remember when you thought you could get pregnant from kissing?  Thank heavens that was totally wrong.

						    Another Denial: The Good Fight Update              I received word from my mom yesterday that the insurance company denied her request for pre-approval again, so no surgery this week.  Perhaps most infuriating is that they claim there isn’t an appeal process for pre-approval—that she should go ahead and have the surgery and appeal their decision afterwards.  My issues are as follows:  Item, the first:  It is difficult to believe in the nonexistence of an appeal process.  If pre-approval is required for non-urgent procedures, I think they are obligated to provide a process for appealing unfavorable decisions.  Then again, that assumes a large measure of reason and fairness, which seem inapplicable to the insurance game.    Item, the second:  This entire experience highlights the ways in which our healthcare system is lacking in integrity.  Things would be just swell if everyone had the same assets and access, but falls short in our present, dingy little reality.  The suggestion that she go ahead with the surgery and appeal later is laughable—this is a $40,000 procedure.  If she had assets such that it didn’t really matter whether it was covered or not, the appeal probably wouldn’t matter as much.  It would still be a lot of money to pay out of pocket, but not prohibitively so.    Item, the third—a continuation of the second:  It’s sad that she’s probably going to end up paying a tidy sum in legal fees to prove that she’s in the right.  Again, a system lacking in integrity (please hold any and all jeers at my chosen profession until the question and answer period at the end of the sermon, thankyouverymuch).  You have to pay to play, and there’s no playing on your own.  This simply isn’t a problem that can be solved with a little diligence and phone work (though even if it were, she’d have a tough time with the phone part).  It seems pretty clear that nothing positive is going to happen without a little (big?) push to compel such action—probably in the form of little white papers wrapped in blue.  Oy.  Item, the fourth:  I’m uncomfortable with the fact that my mom essentially needs to prove why she deserves better hearing.  People, she’s damn near deaf and she’s a professor….isn’t this pretty plainly clear?  Am I just biased because it’s my moma?  I think not.    This whole thing is making me think very, very seriously about patient advocacy law.

						    It could be worse                                     Oy...speaking of insurance nightmares...from the Salt Lake Tribune:  A woman's months long fight for insurance coverage to pay for skull-replacement surgery has ended after her mother's insurer agreed to pay the bill, her mother said Tuesday.       But while Briana Lane's medical problems appear to be ending, she now faces criminal charges stemming from the crash.       The 22-year-old was cited for drunken driving the night of Jan. 10, when she lost control of her Jeep on an icy canyon road near Salt Lake City. The crash sent her through the windshield and eventually to the emergency room, where doctors removed nearly half her skull to treat bleeding on her brain.       For nearly four months, Lane lived in pain without part of her skull, while the hospital and Medicaid determined who would pay for her medical bills. Eventually, the health plan of Lane's mother agreed to retroactively cover her care, costing about $200,000, and doctors replaced the skull piece April 30.       A spokeswoman for the Utah Health Sciences Center, Anne Brillinger, said any alleged wrongdoing by Lane would "absolutely not" affect her medical care.       Lane has been charged with driving under the influence and failure to have a driver license, both misdemeanors, said Roger Blaylock, an assistant district attorney with the Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office.       According to court documents, Lane's blood-alcohol content was 0.15; the legal limit is 0.08. Lane said she has been summoned to appear in Salt Lake County Justice Court.      The case summary by a sheriff's deputy stated Lane was "yelling and screaming profanity" as she was loaded into an ambulance and a "very strong odor of an alcoholic beverage" was noticeable.       Lane's driver license was expired, the deputy wrote. There were no witnesses to the accident.       Lane said Tuesday that she can't remember the night of the accident, but that an unopened beer can in her car exploded, dousing her when the Jeep rolled over.       "By the time the cops came to the accident scene I was out of control so I could see how they thought I had been drinking," Lane said.       Her license expired on her 21st birthday, she said, adding that she didn't realize that having an expired license was tantamount to having no license.

						    Insurance people like crazytalk                    Thanks for all the kind words and thoughts about my mom.  She spoke with an attorney late last week, and they have a pretty sound plan in place.  The first step—which may be all that’s necessary—was to have her doctor write the insurance company a letter explaining why the procedure is medically necessary.  It’s pretty damn compelling.  If that doesn’t work, they’ll request an internal appeal.  If that doesn’t work, they’ll file for an external appeal, where another physician of equal credentials and experience reviews her file and determines whether s/he concurs that the procedure is necessary.  If all of that fails, she’ll sue.  The folks at the doctor’s office seem relatively confident that there’s a good chance the surgery may still go through this week as planned.  All we can do now is wait.

						    Whatsa matter, chuckles?                             I think I need to call people by their actual names less frequently, and use semi-condescending, generic pet names more.  Pally, chief, chuckles, and lollipop are definitely in order.  It’s both dismissive and twee, and I kind of like that.  If you look at it that way, it’s sort of like being Republican.  Since I’m heading off to be a poor and busy law student in the fall, I’ve decided to let my hair grow out again.  The last major chop from long to short was October 18, 2002, so I think it’s about time for a change.  The allure of a relatively maintenance-free cut is quite attractive these days as visions of student budgets dance through my head.  Plus, I’ve been with my stylist (Christopher) for over four years and I’m not too crazy about trying to find someone with decent short hair skills in A2.  When my hair is long, I’ll take a $16 SuperCuts job any day, but a crappy cut when it’s short turns into 6 months of yuck faster than a fat kid can spot the cake in a room.  Do you know those girls who take forever and a day to get themselves from a Pajama State to a Ready To Leave The House State?  I’m so confused by that.  Maybe it was all the locker room time during my swim team years, but I’ve always been decently efficient at getting ready.  Even on my slow, puttering days, I’m no match for some when it comes to distance ready-getting.  What is it they do during that time?  I mean, I’m pretty sure it involves lotion at some point, but the rest escapes me.

						    Take your policy and shove it.                        Is there anything more heartbreaking than knowing that your mom is really, really sad and you’re too far away to do anything but call and email?  For those who don’t know, my mom is profoundly hearing impaired and tackles the difficulties of being a university professor despite her hearing loss with a daily, Herculean effort.  She has about 16% accuracy on the single-word portion of an audiogram.  Recently, she met with a doctor who decided she was a perfect candidate for a cochlear implant, which would radically change her life.  Everything was scheduled for next Thursday…and the insurance folks decided today they’re pulling the plug on the whole thing.  “Not medically necessary,” they say.  Unless the billing crew from her doc’s office can make some sort of major headway in the next few days, her choices are to a) postpone and keep lobbying, or b) pay the whole $50k herself.  Makes me sick.  I don’t normally say/request things like this, but if you have a second, please send some positive thoughts in my mom’s general direction.

						    Color me surprised                                   I was a little surprised by Bush's show of support for Rumsfeld today.  Seems pretty ill-advised, since this kind of kills the possibility of spinning a Rumsignation into a free-from-the-poisoned-limb celebration for the Bush camp.    My calendar tells me that as of this Friday I'll have 11 weeks left at work.  I know that's starting to count down rather rapidly--and I'm happy about that--but damn if I don't want to quit in June and sit around and do sweet fuckall until school starts instead.  During times like these, I lament deeply the decision to get a desktop instead of a laptop the last time they replaced my computer at work.  A laptop means working from home, which I would really, really dig.  I wonder how well that would work...  Fine.  I know it wouldn't work.  I am, however, going to attempt to stay on payroll as a consultant during the fall.  Not unreasonable, and it might make the fall finances a bit nicer.

						    It's my party and I'll have it if I want to.         If I have one goal for the rest of the year, it’s that I’m going to have a damned birthday party if it kills me.  Last year, I had this awesome plan ready for a happy hour at my favorite pub in Houston—spent a long and agonizing week working on the guest list, carefully crafted to bring together a blend of people from the various facets of my world.  The day before I was going to send out the Evite, a woman from work sent around an email inviting people to *her* birthday-happy-hour thing the weekend before mine, at the same. Damn. Pub.  Given that the core of my guest list was made up of people from work who had just received the preempting email, I cancelled mine.  Feh.  This year.    Monster.com commercials these days—the ones where the people stand up and give their please-hire-me spiel—make me unbelievably sad.    Went to the fella’s house last night for dinner…man, can he cook.  I’ve dated guys before who felt like they cooked, but they were wrong.  Cereal isn’t cooking.  Skillet Sensations isn’t (aren’t?) cooking if that’s the extent of one’s repertoire.  No, the thing about P’s cooking that is sooo delightful is that it a) isn’t a big production number—he just moves into the kitchen and casually produces real, actual food, b) contains real ingredients in interesting combinations, c) tastes fanfuckingtastic.  You have to appreciate a man whose copy of The Joy of Cooking is flagged with Post-its.  Props, mad props.  Speaking of food, I’m starved.  If I listen really carefully, I think I can hear a Lender’s bagel calling my name from the freezer.  I should probably go see what it wants.

						    Life is good.   As I was walking across the parking lot of my apartment complex this morning, having just pulled in and parked after an evening furlough at Pete's house, I was struck by the truly delicious weather.  It was somewhere in the upper 50s, sunny, crisp...very fragrant air.  Wearing shorts and sneakers without socks, I felt like I was going off to do something active and summery--like hiking, kayaking...something more fun than work.  It was wonderful, and put me in a great mood for getting ready.  Not that I'm not already in a wonderful mood.  Pete can take most of the credit, for sure. It feels like everything is falling nicely into place for the foreseeable next few chapters in my life.  The housing issue for the fall is working itself out neatly, thanks to a few friendly realtors and a willing summer starter with a digital camera.  Various and sundry TPR dealings this summer will continue to provide a steady stream of saveable income that will help with the car issue (must sell the truck for something cheaper--need something in the line of a down payment) as well as the other millieu of expenses that are coming my way.  Man, this morning I added up in my head how much extra cash I'd have laying around if I hadn't had to pay for school visits, Michigan's deposit, and my mother[sexual intercoursing] taxes.  Kind of depressing...much like the depression that set in when I figured out how much I spent on applications.  Gah, it's cool to know I was able to pull all of that in with little turmoil, but holy crap I'd have a nice chunk of change sitting around otherwise.  Yeesh.  My thumb itches like crazy, and I don't know why.  The aforementioned Thursday kids were, as predicted, a special sort of hell.  I have *never* had a group with such legion comprehension problems.  Jesus tapdancing Christ...I damn near left during the break.  Imagine trying to swim through a river of mud with a pair of unruly rhinos, and that's approximately the level of difficulty I had getting the point across to them.  If folks don't understand, hey, that's cool...it's a bit of a conceptual mountain to climb.  What really frosts my cookies is when students don't understand, get beligerent about their non-understanding, give up, and tell me the technique can't possibly work.  There are definitely times when I want to announce that my ride home is waiting outside, that it's a big huff, and that I think I'll leave in it.

						    That for which we are thankful                     I had a crush once on a guy who I helped stage manage a play during the spring of my senior year in high school.  His name was Torrey, and, in looking back, I recognize now that he was just one of many not-so-sane and exceptionally dismal men I’ve been attracted to.  He flaked out on work—both things that paid and things that didn’t.  My mom sold him my car as I was leaving for college, and he paid a friend to “steal” it in hopes that he might not have to keep paying her for it…really, not one of society’s finest.  He was, however, a very skilled chef, and part of his apprenticeship had been with a Chinese master of some sort.  One of the tattoos on his forearm (I know, I know…give me a break, I was 17) was a Chinese symbol that meant “heart without anger.”    The experience of knowing Torrey taught me a lot of things—never set up payment plans on private car deals without bank involvement, how to recognize cocaine usage from the look of someone’s eyes…but the idea of a heart without anger sticks with me the most.  Today, I have no idea what the tattoo looked like—hell, I can’t really remember what he looked like—but the concept has stayed with me.  A few nights ago, as I headed to bed churning with anger over the day’s events, I remembered Torrey’s tattoo.  As I exhaled deeply, I let as much of it go as I could…and sent out a silent prayer of sorts for the serenity to experience a heart without anger.  It worked, at least long enough for me to fall asleep peacefully—and as I walked through the following day, I continued to gain perspective in a way that made the anger feel less important.  For that, and for the countless times before that I’ve called upon the idea behind that small tattoo, I am very grateful to Torrey.  Thanks.

						    'Tis a gift to be simple                         It’s been a long, long time since the last time I put together the Lists of Things I Like and Things I Don’t Like.  I think I stopped doing them for two reasons: a) sometimes the justifications portion of the lists take longer than my hurry-up-and-wait work day allows, and b) I’m intensely lazy and entitled.  Sooo….I’m bringing back the Lists, with a facelift.  In our current climate of complex and enigmatic social issues, I’m bringing a bit of sophomoric simplicity to life by polarizing it all into Good and Bad.  Good • Elaborate breakfasts on weekend mornings • Full-body sneezes • Gmail • Unexpected windfalls • Advance meal planning that facilitates snacks • Leaving work early • Boxing, when done by others • Running, when done by me • The fearless use of passive voice • Stevie Wonder • Spending 40 cents more to get real Q-tips • Bank errors in your favor • Birth control that comes with a video game • Potatoes • Naps, solo • Naps, with someone you really dig—particularly when they turn into Snaps • Slinkys • Inappropriate capitalization That Makes Your Point • Free pens  Bad • Fatigue • Raisins • Orange Juice • Boredom • Smelly garbage disposals • Skipped meals • Thermostats set at 68 when it’s 74 and raining outside • Drama • That truck that’s parked just enough over the line to make the second parking space inaccessible to everything but a Miata • Incompetence • Incontinence • Impatience • Saving 40 cents and going for fake Q-tips • Under-eye circles • Finding unpleasant souvenirs from the cat in the laundry basket • Cashiers who glare • Faucets that leak • Houseplants that speak • Unidentifiable odors

						    Counting, Betting, Complaining, Inviting          After today, I have 5 weeks and 4 days of regular work left.  There was a time (a long time) when I seriously considered working through the first week of August.  It seemed like it might be a good idea to get one more week of pay, to leave 5 more days of training my successor, etc….not so much.  The money—feh, I’ll figure that part out.  It looks like I’ll come out ahead either way I cut it, so the minimization of the agro is definitely worth it.    We rented a movie this weekend.  From Blockbuster.  On my card.  It’s due Saturday (see?  I know when it’s due!).  Anyone who’d like to cast bets on whether or not I bring it back on time is welcome…I won’t be offended.  In fact, I’ll start it out with an Abraham Lincoln that says I end up taking it back Sunday morning.    Not to complain (wait, what?  Who am I?  What is this blog about again?  Oh, right.), but I need to say in an official manner that it sucks *royally* to realize at 11:45 p.m. that you need to be at work an hour and a half early the next morning.  That, for those slow on the uptake, would be me today.  Due to a breakfast I helped organize, I hit the security gates this morning at 6:55 a.m.  It feels like I’ve been here for a hundred years this morning, and it’s only 8:35.  Wowie.  I think today *definitely* calls for some Bank Admin games.  It’s true, we make up our own sad little brands of fun.  There’s Poor Man’s Lacrosse, where Little RayRay and I use hardhats to catch a stress ball we throw back and forth across the divider between our desks.  There’s Peppermint Toss, where we try to throw Starlight Mints into a coworker’s shirt pocket.  Finally, there’s the many, many fun things we do with laser pointers.  Surprisingly, racing them across the ceiling takes a steady hand and no shortage of skill.  Sometimes, we play Laser Pointer Chicken, where we take turns shining them into the VPs’ offices for as long as we dare.  Really, it’s a good time to be had by all.    In other news, I [heart] gmail.  Now that I have invites, I feel like one of the cool kids.  In a way, it kind of makes up for all the crap I took in high school.  Who knew that the power to bring others into a beta release of a web-based email program could compensate for all the why-aren’t-you-pretty-like-your-sisters, what-are-you-looking-at-freak, why-don’t-I-just-take-this-orange-juice-from-you and well-we-know-YOU-aren’t-going-to-homecoming comments….wait, actually, it doesn’t.  But it’s pretty fun nevertheless.

						    Meet you by the swings in fifteen                 When I first heard about the proposal before the AMA requesting an endorsement for physicians’ refusal to treat medmal attorneys, I was really, really steamed.  In what way does that make anything resembling ethical sense, I thought.  After long consideration (okay, medium consideration), I’ve changed my mind.  Read this, then see my comments:  CHICAGO - A doctor's proposal asking the American Medical Association to endorse refusing care to attorneys involved in medical malpractice cases drew an angry response from colleagues Sunday at the annual meeting of the nation's largest physicians group.   Many doctors stood up to denounce the resolution in passionate speeches -- even after its sponsor, Dr. J. Chris Hawk, asked that it be withdrawn.   Hawk, a South Carolina surgeon, said he made the proposal to draw attention to rising medical malpractice costs. The resolution asks that the AMA tell doctors that -- except in emergencies -- it is not unethical to refuse care to plaintiffs' attorneys and their spouses.   "It expresses the frustration I have with a broken system," said Hawk. He said doctors are leaving his state or retiring early because of insurance premiums -- making it harder for patients to receive care.   Neurologist Michael Williams said although he understood Hawk's frustration, the resolution never should have been introduced because it seeks to discriminate against a group of people.   The resolution left the AMA "a really big mess to clean up," Williams said.   For years, the AMA's top legislative lobbying priority has been the medical malpractice system, and some delegates said the resolution could hurt those efforts by giving trial lawyers ammunition.   AMA committees considered more than 250 reports and resolutions Sunday. The committees will make recommendations to the group's delegates, who will begin voting Monday afternoon on policies to adopt.   Last week, the daughter of a Mississippi legislator said she was denied treatment by a plastic surgeon because her father opposes limits in damage suits against doctors.   Dr. Michael Kanosky said he referred Kimberly Banks to other plastic surgeons to have her burn scars removed because he had lobbied on the other side of the issue and saw an ethical conflict.  ******************************************************** We ask a lot of our physicians.  We ask them to be certain about uncertain things, to fix our bodies and our minds without consequence or tradeoffs, to undergo extensive and grueling training while being ridiculously under compensated so we can be “sure” that they’re adequately prepared to handle us.  We hold them to a high standard—as well we should--but often we do it without perspective or empathy.    And when things go south, we sue them.  We sue them and demand indulgently excessive remuneration.  We ask for their licenses, for money to cover additional treatment or long-term care, and for money to ease our fragile minds.  Medical malpractice insurance has become so prohibitive in some states that there are shortages in some specialties.  Try having a baby in Florida—Ob/Gyn malpractice insurance runs around $210,000, and there are fewer and fewer docs who are willing to continue practicing there.  Independent, private practices are the hit the hardest, since they don’t have the financial backing of a hospital to support their insurance payments.  In many states, the premiums can’t be spread over the year like car insurance--it’s a cash deal, upfront.    Given that, and given our current litigious climate in which more and more registered voters view plaintiffs as lucky bastards who have found a way to make an end run to a lottery jackpot of sorts, can you really blame a physician who says s/he doesn’t feel like turning the other cheek and smiling through treatment of a patient who earns a (handsome) living seeking exorbitant damages for medmal suits?  Granted, it’s a slippery damn slope, and I’m not convinced this is the path towards any meaningful, long-term solution.  Who is next?  What about the plaintiffs in frivolous medmal suits?  What about jurors who award astronomical punitive damages to plaintiffs?  Surely, each group holds a hefty corner of the responsibility bag, so are they the next groups for whom treatment is refused?    I hope there’s resolution here at some point, but I think it’s going to require two things--only one of which seems even remotely realistic, so I suppose I can reasonably foresee a partial solution.   Thing 1)  We need substantial tort reform legislation and we need it now.  We need it to be comprehensive, but to keep its eye on the ball and not to include a mixed bag of other access red herrings that pull voters and legislators all asunder from the real issue at hand (Texas Prop 12, I'm looking at you).  I think this is possible.  Not necessarily probable, but possible.  Thing 2)  We need a realignment of the expectations of the masses.  There are six people in each civil courtroom who wield a significantly powerful sword or responsibility in medmal cases.  The jurors, pulled from a random pool of registered voters, are (often) responsible for assigning dollar value to the actual and punitive damage awards.  The numbers they hand down are upheld more often than overturned, and to ignore their role in this circus is intellectually lazy.  The expectation that someone should be responsible when bad things happen doesn’t stay behind on the courthouse steps.  Worse, we have come to lose any distinction between “responsible” and “monetarily so.”  And we have adopted a truly inane value scale for what a medical mistake is “worth.”  I deeply, deeply disagree with the notion that an error in physicians’ judgment, a miscalculated treatment plan, hell--even a grievously misguided set of intentions should be rectified with ghastly sums of money.  Yet I am, apparently, in the minority on that one.    Once, during my more medically-oriented days, I treated a woman’s sprained ankle in an emergency room.  During my time with her, it came out that she didn’t have insurance, but it didn’t matter because she could pay cash for her treatment.  Why?  Her husband had been badly injured in a chemical explosion the previous year, and their settlement had been in excess of five million dollars, not including the reimbursement for medical care or workman’s compensation.  She breezily told me that, since the receipt of their settlement, they had bought cars for everyone in their family and were in the process of building a new house (it was, in fact, in looking at model homes that she had tripped and sprained her ankle--I wondered out loud if she was planning to sue the builder of the homes, and she was).  Though I was very sorry for her husband’s state of permanent disability as a result of the accident, I’m still not convinced such an experience warrants the instant affluence their family obtained.    If a chemical burn is worth $5M and some change, why isn’t it worth $10M?  $20M?  Gee, we’re really sorry this bad thing happened to you, so we’ll make you really wealthy to compensate.  It’s such fuzzy logic, and it demands a sort of absolute responsibility/blame for anything we don’t like…and that’s not how it works.  Still, until that mentality undergoes a big revision, I think we’ll continue to have exorbitant jury awards in civil suits.    Long-term, the refusal to treat medmal attorneys may not be the most ethically sound solution, nor may it give way to the most sustainable pattern of resolution.  Still, sometimes there’s something immediate and impressive to be gained from bypassing the traditional, administrative channels of resolution and meeting your opponent out by the swings.

						    The Waiting Game                                 If you happen to know anyone who took the April MCAT, give them a little (or medium, or big, or whatever strikes you) hug this weekend--scores should be out early Tuesday morning.  For my fellow law school applicants, folks, we've got nothin' on the med school peeps in terms of waiting hell.  It's been nearly 8 weeks since they took the damn thing, and that's enough to make the sanest of folks punch their crazy bag a few times.    And that's to say nothing of the ridiculously prolonged and expensive application process.  A tough row to hoe, for sure.  My hat is off.

						    Shoes and Schadenfreude: an Unholy Pair           My shoes are too big.  They’re too big today, they were too big the day I bought them, and they’ll be too big for all time and eternity.  I understand this, fully and completely, yet I continue to wear them every few months.  I have no idea why.  Do I think my feet will grow half a size?  Is it that I think I might have been a little wrong all the other times I’ve worn them?  Who knows.  Actually, I do know; they’re a size 9, and hence should fit.  Should.  That, and I bought them with store credit from the Christmas gift my boss gave me last year.  Really and truly, I appreciate the gesture but I just didn’t need another cut glass objet d’art.  No, not even a semi useful bowl.  If I were an octogenarian philanthropist with a large house and fancy candies needing a functional yet beautiful place to await hungry hands, it would have been perfect.  More importantly, the wedding countdown is on!  No, duh, not mine.  Yikes, though it would be an exciting thing at some point, it's waaaay too early and I think that would be the level of complexity this summer to push me into a fugue state, wherein I could only speak in lyrics from songs by men named Neil (most prominently, of course, the partners of my favorite imaginary law firm: Diamond, Sedaka and Young, L.L.P.)    The wedding in question is my stepsister’s.  In less than 6 weeks, she’s allegedly getting married in a small ceremony at her future in-laws’s house.  Why the doubt?  You be the judge:  the first notice of this blessed event came my way a little over two weeks ago via voicemail from my dad.  The message went something like this:  “Uhh….hi there.  I have an…interesting question for you.  It, um, looks like we’re going to be having a wedding here on July 17th and I was wondering if, uh, there’s, uh, any chance that you would be interested in, uh, being here.  Yeeaahh….it looks like M and D are going to have a wedding.  Aaaaaanyway, give me a call back and let me know if you think you can make it so I can get working on a ticket.  MBye.”  When I called back, gushing pseudo-enthusiasm for attending this happy, happy nuptial celebration, it was even weirder.  After a few minutes of the usual awkwardness we have on the phone, I tried to use the wedding as fodder for nice conversation.  Trying to seem genuinely interested, I asked “soooo….is she excited?”  And we rounded the corner into the truly bizarre.  Dad:  Um, it’s kind of strange, actually. Me:  How so? Dad:  Wellllll, he hasn’t actually proposed. Me:  I’m sorry? Dad:  No proposal. Me: Huh? Dad:  I know, it’s weird.   Me: But there’s a date…and you guys are trying to decide whether to have it at your house or D’s parents’ house… Dad: But no proposal. Me: [pause]  Does she know? Dad: Does she know? Me:  About the wedding.  Does M know this is happening? Dad:  Oh sure…she bought a dress last week. Me:  Does he know? Dad:  Does she know?  I just told you. Me: Nooo….does HE know? Dad: D?  Um…..I think so.  We talk about it in front of him an awful lot. Me: Oh my. Dad:  Yeah.  It’s complicated.  I keep thinking this is going to make him feel uncomfortable, what with the way we discuss it in front of him, especially when she turns to him and says “It’s not like I’ve been PROPOSED to yet!” Me:  Wow. Dad:  Yeah, I could talk for a long time trying to explain it, but it still probably wouldn’t make sense. Me:  That’s cool.  And to think, at first, I was only going for the food.

						    I’m not very good at this                         No matter which way I approach the matter, the truth is that I’m not very good at returning movies on time.  And of course, by “not very good” I mean “essentially incapable.”  In the days when I patronized Blockbuster, I think I managed to put three or four employees’ children through college and graduate school with my many, many late fees.  It’s enough to make one decide not to rent movies anymore.  From an economist’s standpoint (which I rarely take, given that I believe economics is a made-up science for socially inept people who are good at graphs), I can’t help but factor the late fees into the rental cost, yielding an actual cost that is much, much higher.    Did you know that not all Blockbusters are created equal?  They aren’t.  They can set their own prices, which really bakes your noodle the one time you go BBuster hopping trying to find a copy of  Superstar  to view before a pep rally at work, for which you’ve been asked to perform a Mary-Catherine Gallagher skit.  I don’t know anyone that’s happened to.    I really enjoyed digital cable when I had it a few years ago.  Not cheap, by any means, but I had the package that included something like 42 versions each of HBO, Encore, and Starz, so there was always a movie or episode of  SITC  to watch.  Always.  Of course, I solved this problem completely by taking on way too many teaching gigs outside of work and thus rendering the idea of spending upwards of 80 large a month on cable I would never be home to watch laughable at best.    I know, I know…there are other options now.  I hear people rave about Netflix all the time, and maybe someday I’ll give it a spin.  Come to think of it, I remember something about my mom promising to get me a 6 month gift subscription two Christmases ago, but it never happened.  Clearly, I’m no worse for the wear.  The idea is spectacular, but I fear the reality would quickly dissolve into me feeling angry and used over the fact that I continue to pay $20 a month for two movies I can’t bring myself to send back.  Oy.    Last year, it seemed like there was an answer to all my movie rental problems: they installed a DVD vending machine in my apartment complex.  For $3.50 (less if you have the coupon they email you after each rental), you can check out one of several new releases.  Perfect, right?  I thought so.  Your $3.50 gives you the thing until midnight on the second calendar day from the day you rent it.  The machine is in the fitness center, so it’s accessible 24-7.  Not a huge selection, but incredibly painless when you feel like  urlLink thurpling  downstairs and grabbing a movie without a lot of bother.    Pete and I decided to rent movies and do a whole lot of nothing last Friday and Saturday, and the DVD machine was really handy.  No trip to the out-of-the-way-for-both-of-us BBuster, a fine selection of new releases from which we chose two, and a price that’s at least a dollar below the rental market for our area.  All we (I) had to do was return them by 11:59 p.m. on Sunday.  It was a tragedy, therefore, that I decided to rewatch  Love Actually  on Sunday evening.  Somehow, as I sifted through the (muted) bonus material and listened on the phone to volumes one through four of the lizard-in-my-best-friend’s-house adventure, 12:30 came around awfully quickly.  Dammit.   They’re still sitting on my kitchen counter, too.  Double dammit.

						    That's that                                        For all practical purposes, today was my last day of work.  I'll go back in for one more (partial!) day later in the month when my vacation runs out, but this was basically it.  Three years, one month and twenty-six days doesn't sound like a tremendously long time, but it feels like my first day was a lifetime ago.  After all the agro and all the heartache that place has given me, I wasn't surprised that today felt so anticlimatic...but it still seems like I missed something.  Like I should have felt sad or excited or anxious...or....something.  Rather, I just tired very quickly of having the same conversation with people over and over again about where I'm going and yes I'll miss the Bank and yes I'm excited and no I won't miss the Texas weather and yes I know it gets cold in Michigan.   Still, I'm not sorry we didn't do more stuff to mark my leaving.  I really don't like being the center of attention at those kinds of events (I know, weird....there's actually a time when I  don't  like to be the center of attention...who knew?).  It was time to leave.  Despite a few well-intentioned folks, the Bank is a tremendously toxic, petty place filled with toxic, petty people.  This life is too short to be spent surrounded by people who spin nothing but negativity and make you question your self-worth.  It's a waste to be underutilized and underappreciated at 24 by people who are threatened by ideas, by intelligence, by creativity.  It's just not worth the aggravation, and the money definitely isn't enough to make it worth slogging along for a few more years.  I learned many things, but it's time to move on and do something more productive.   In the background right now,  City of Angels  is playing, and Nicholas Cage reminds me that "somethings are true whether you believe in them or not."  It's one of my favorite lines from that movie, and I've been thinking recently about the converse--that some things are false despite the depths to which you believe in them.  I think one of the more grisly parts of dealing with things in a nonescapist reality is recognizing that, sometimes, people and experiences aren't what you want them to be.  Sometimes, your expectations exceed what the situation can possibly yield, and sometimes your assessments are wrong.  Yet there's a decided lack of punch in the the practice of expecting nothing to avoid disappointment.  As Steve Martin reminds me in  L.A. Story , "a kiss may not be the truth, but it is what we wish we true."  Maybe that's why we tend to kiss with eyes closed--makes it easier to wish together the holes in what we know, what we feel.  The willing suspension of disbelief can be a shell of safety.

						    Don't ever get them wet &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Intuitively, it seems like suburbs are a safe zone outside the dangers realm of the city.&nbsp; Pretty stucco-exterior homes with sweeping driveways and zillions of bedrooms punctuate tree-lined streets, families stroll to community pools with bouncy children, and runners make their merry way through well-manicured greenbelt trails.&nbsp; It’s that last part that I chose to indulge last night, and the experience revealed a bit of the suburbs’ edgy side.&nbsp;   While housesitting for my canine niece and nephew last night, I decided to take advantage of the clean air in lovely Kingwood and go for a run on the trails that lace throughout the small suburb.&nbsp; I tied my key to my shoe, grabbed a water bottle and my phone, and hit the trail.&nbsp; The greenbelts, if you aren’t familiar, are wooded, paved trails that snake throughout the maze of streets up there.&nbsp; Since they weave through and across the whole twisty, cul-de-sacky mess, they aren’t exactly straight.&nbsp; Can you see where this is going?  I decided to go 15 minutes out and head back—I’m used to running inside and while it wasn’t especially hot, it wasn’t cool, either.&nbsp; After 15 minutes, it was getting pretty dusky.&nbsp; The alarm on my phone told me it was time to head back to the house, so I turned around and retraced my steps to the last turn I had made.&nbsp; It’s not possible to stay on the same trail for very long, because they all deadend into each other.&nbsp; To make things easier, I had taken only right turns, so everything should have been a left on the way back.&nbsp; Somehow, somewhere on the return trip, I either missed a turn or took a wrong one, because I found myself on a street that wasn’t anything like the right one.&nbsp; This was after making several wrong turns, finding myself on other wrong streets, and heading back into the trail.&nbsp; At this point, it was getting really dark and it seemed like continuing on the unlit trail was a b-a-d bad idea.&nbsp; Surely, I thought, that street would bring me out to the main road I knew and I could find my way back to the house from there.  That ended up being true, but only after about 40 minutes of wandering around.&nbsp;   Recall the contents in my hands at the beginning of this story—my phone and a water bottle.&nbsp; During the active running part of the evening (once I figured out I was lost, I started walking because I wasn’t sure how long it would take me to find my way and I didn’t feel like wasting energy I might need for lots of wandering), I (foolishly) kept switching the phone and water bottle between my hands.&nbsp; After a while, I think the phone was in a pretty wet hand nonstop.&nbsp; Shortly before I found the right street, a friend in Austin called, and I added to the phone’s water experience by holding it against my sweaty little face so we could talk.&nbsp;   To say the phone didn’t like that would be a rather offensive understatement.&nbsp; It actually  hissed  at me.&nbsp; Then it started pushing its own 3 button over and over again.&nbsp; Finally, it just gave up.&nbsp; You can turn it on, and you can push buttons all you want, but nothing happens.&nbsp;   So I went to a Sprint store today and bought the  urlLink phone  I’ve been eyeing for a month or so.&nbsp; It’s pretty great, though I’m kind of cranky that I had to buy it after all—I had only recently decided to forego this purchase as there was nothing wrong with the old phone.&nbsp; So it goes.&nbsp;   In other news that makes me look silly, I accidentally put my fingers in my coffee this morning, thinking I was reaching into my slinky.&nbsp;&nbsp;

There’s only one more week of work left!&nbsp; Technically, my last day isn’t until the 11th, because I decided to take my remaining vacation days rather than cash them out, but I’ll only pop in for a few hours that day.&nbsp; That is by no means to say that I’m doing “real” work now…rather, I’m staying entertained and perpetuating the myth that I might be doing something productive by spending gratuitous amounts of time on the resurrected UCB.&nbsp; As I write this, I’m about 15 posts away from the current post leader…which I’m not sure is an honor.&nbsp; Ah well, that’s how it goes when you’re winding things down at work.&nbsp; Especially on a Friday.&nbsp; A slow Friday.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

						    Items of Non-interest                             A few things that have punctuated the last 10 days or so: 1) Lizards don't belong in my bathroom. 2) Breakups are wretched, no matter how well everyone behaves. 3) Intense boredom has an uncanny way of amplifying one's tension and feelings of malcontent. 4) I really need to clean out both my fridge and my car. 5) I need school to start, like, now.  Coming soon: I'm going to go back to a more structured format for my posts, since the minutiae or my day-to-day stuff is neither fun to read nor fun to write.  I'm going to try keeping the bulk of my posts to recommendations about stuff I like.  I tend to have pretty solid product loyalty, but only after a lengthy trial period.  People, on balance, seem pretty happy with things I recommend, so I thought it might make sense to put them all in one place.    That's the plan, anyway.  We all know what happens to plans...

      I should toss out the caveat that, at present, I'm not using any books or other training programs.  That will probably change at some point, but right now this is all based on what makes sense to me.  Today, I decided it is important to build endurance by combining elements of the tri, in addition to working on them individually.  So I made this afternoon's workout a distance day of sorts, by combining the riding and the running.  I did 5 miles on a recumbent bike and immediately followed it with a 2-mile run.  Whoa.  The first half mile of the run was *tough*.  I had to stop and stretch for a minute before I could go on, but after that I felt great running.  It was definitely a different kind of feeling physically taxed, but it was good.   I need a bike--a real one.  That'll be my task to wrangle this semester.  In all honesty, that's the only part of running this thing that scares me off a little--it's a pretty expensive sport.  The AA tri pretty much requires a wetsuit, which I also need to track down in the next year.  I think I can find a prety good deal on eBay, so hopefully it won't be too terribly expensive.  Then there's the gear to go with the bike--shoes, helmet, etc.--and I'll certainly need another pair of running shoes by then.  Well, screw it.  This is important to me, and I want to continue doing it...so an investment or two is one part of making it happen.   All sponsorship offers will be taken seriously!

      Be forewarned that this blog is ridiculously self-masturbatory.  I'm writing it more to keep myself honest during the process of training for my first triathlon than anything else.  If you find it hopelessly boring, I don't blame you in the slightest.   Why tri?  I haven't been in very good shape in a long time--not since I quit swimming in high school.  Ugh, that makes me cringe.  I've half-heartedly started and promptly dropped various exercise plans since I was 17, and I finally decided to get serious this summer.  I'm 24 years old, and if I don't watch it I'm going to wake up 30 one day in crummy shape.  Bleh.  That thought process was further compounded by the impending start of law school this fall.  If I don't start in shape, what's to prompt me to get there?  It seemed like a fast track to end up on the other side of school with severely sedentary habits permanently ingrained in my lifestyle.   So I started running and lifting weights.  To my pleasant surprise, the running came more easily than I thought it would.  I started running 30-30s--30 minute workouts with a main set of 30 seconds run/30 seconds walk for 15 minutes.  Within 6 weeks or so of doing it seriously, I worked up to running 3 12-minute miles.  Between the weights and the running, I lost a good portion of the stubborn weight that's bothered me since I graduated from college.  Soon, it seemed like having a bigger goal was a good idea--something to keep me motivated, and something with more substance than "being thin" or even "in better shape."  My first thought was to train for a half marathon, but I decided against it.  I'm happier during weeks when I strike a more even balance between running, weights, and other cardio than on weeks when I run more than anything else.  My best friend suggested a tri and it made sense.  The sprint distance triathlons seem like a doable place to start, so here goes.  I'm planning to do the Elite Endeavors Tri in Ann Arbor next June.   At present, I'm 5'9" and weigh in around 150.  I'm not sure what percent body fat goes along with that, but maybe I'll find some calipers and enter it soon.  I don't trust the measurement that comes from the plates you stand on--when we had a health assessment at work two years ago, it told me I had something like 32% bodyfat, and the entire diagnostic report was laden with dire warnings about the severe health risks my extreme obesity bore.  I was about 10 pounds heavier than I am now, so whatever.  Stay tuned.  I'll log progress and thoughts as I make my way through the next year.

      I'm at a point in the process of losing weight and changing my body composition where I have a small "loose skin" problem.  I guess I've never stuck with it long enough to get to this point--where I've lost a decent amount of weight and bulk (2 size smaller!) but haven't lost enough overall body fat for my skin to have pulled back over my muscles.  Or something like that.  It kind of sucks, because I can see great muscle development is happening under there, but it's all covered with kind of smooshy skin.  There's, like, a *handful* of fat I can grab by my hip when I lay down.  Ugh.  Nothing to do but stick with it and lay off the Krispy Kremes.  Oh, I guess that makes breakfast this morning a loss.  Ah well.  The thing I have to keep telling myself is that I'm not on a timetable for the visual part of this process.  As long as I'm making fitness progress towards the longterm goal of completing the tri, the rest is secondary.  I'm making progress, and that's the important part.   I did a full round of weights yesterday--upper and lower.  Good stuff.   The Workout        Squats     2x10 @ 25lbs/ea Lunges     2x10 @ 20lbs/ea Calf Raises     2x10 @ 20lbs Shoulder Press     20x10 @ 20lbs/ea Lat Pull     3x10 @ 60lbs Dumbbell Rows     2x10 @20lbs; 1x5 @ 25lbs Bench Press     2x10 @ 25lbs/ea  I'll rest today (well, as restful as packing like mad can be) and run distance tomorrow.  Anyone think I can do 4 miles?  We'll see!

      I used yesterday as a rest day so today could be a distance cardio day.  Keep in mind as you see what I call "distance" is relative.   Today, it was 5 miles biking followed immediately by 2 miles running.  So, yeah, not exactly a Herculean task, but I was definitely done by the end of the second mile run.  No pain, just a very red face and a strong mental kick in the shorts that said "dude, don't do another half mile if you want to be anything like useful for the rest of the day."  I tend to listen to those admonitions.  Since I've been having some issues with headaches after cardio workouts from what I think is a drop in blood sugar, I came right home and made a few cottage cheese pancakes to munch on with a glass of water.  Don't freak out--the pancakes are pretty damn tasty.  They're made with cottage cheese, eggs, oatmeal, a splash of milk, and a banana.  Not too shabby, good protein, low fat, natural sugars.  Hopefully, this will exempt me from a headache tonight.

      Bah.  This moving business is total crap.  Who knew a small apartment could seem to have so much stuff in it?  The process of packing, cleaning, and avoiding all of the above has, in conjunction with some very sore legs from weights earlier this week, taken a little bite out of my workout schedule.  Ah well.  I ran 1.5 miles today.  Ta da.

      Rest day today.  The weights yesterday were definitely intense enough--serious soreness abounds.  That is all.

      Hoo boy.  I intended to be much more productive today, but somehow the pull to be somewhat lazy on the first Monday I didn't have to go to work was a bit too much.  Ah well, it was nice to screw around a bit.  The original plan was to get to my weights earlier in the day, when the fitness center wouldn't be so crowded, but such was not the case.     The workout:   Squats     2x10 @ 25lbs/ea; 1x10 @ 20lbs/ea Deadlifts     3x15 @ 30lbs/ea Calf raises (single leg)     2x15 @ 20lbs/ea Lunges     2x10 @ 20lbs/ea Weighted crunches     3x15 @ 10lbs  Though I really haven't wanted to, I think I need to get gloves to use while I do weights--at least while I'm still using dumbbells so exclusively.  Once I get above 20lb bells, the weight really starts to hurt my hands.  It's not a blister problem; it hurts the little bones in and around the first joints of my fingers (okay, maybe "first joint" isn't the right term--I mean the first joints that start in my hand, not the ones closest to the fingertips).   This was the first time I've done lunges since I took a Powerflex class in college.  Whoa.  It was a push to make it through two sets of 10.  It's been less than an hour since I finished and I'm feeling some serious (good) soreness in my glutes.  That's good, because the squats and deadlifts haven't been giving me soreness there so far.  As I was doing them, I also felt the gluteus medius working pretty hard.  Also good.

       Today was upper body weight day.  Since I'm still using the silly fitness center at my apartment, the lat pulldown is the only thing I don't do with dumbells.  The other machines are a little cheesy and not very well-designed, so I bypasss them almost entirely.       The Workout   Shoulder shrug     3x15 @ 25lbs/ea Shoulder press     3x10 @ 20lbs/ea Lat pulldown     3x15 @ 60lbs Dumbbell rows     3x10 @ 20lbs/ea Bench press     2x10 @ 20lbs/ea; 1x6 @ 25lbs/ea  After that was all done, I did this bullshit bicep curl-twisting thing I saw on (cringe) a VH1 special about Hollywood butts.  Dude, I know.  Basically, one starts with a dumbbell in each hand and feet about three feet apart, then twists to the right and does a bicep curl with the left.  Lather, rinse, repeat to the other side.  It was supposed to work butt, abs, and biceps, but as far as I can tell it's nothing more than a way to do bicep curls while making your legs look pretty in the mirror.  Lame.   Lower body tomorrow.  I've been taking a break from this one for a little while to let my right knee have a bit of a vacation.  It felt pretty great yesterday during my ride/run, and only marginally stiff this morning.  (Backstory: during an ill-advised rish hour run to Home Depot in 2000, a heavy metal door fell on the back of my right knee, crushing the soft tissue pretty well.  At the time, it bruised so badly I almost had to have it drained, and it's never been quite the same.)
