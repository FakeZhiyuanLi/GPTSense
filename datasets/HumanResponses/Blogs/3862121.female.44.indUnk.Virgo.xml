      I went to visit my dietitian yesterday in some trepidation, convinced that I would have put on more weight since my previous visit, but I was actually a pound lighter. So, from this relatively stable place, I think it's time for me to publish my current weight. 119.3 kilograms, or 18 stone 11, or 263 pounds.  Sounds like a lot, huh? Apparently I wear it well.  So what is the plan that I'm currently following? Basically I have to plan my meals and snacks each day (3 meals and 2 snacks, evenly spaced out during the day), and fill in a sheet every time I eat, immediately after I've finished eating. I have to say what time it was, precisely what I ate, where I was when I ate it, and any additional comments. I put a bracket around combinations of foods that I consider to be a meal, and an asterisk by anything I ate that I consider to be excessive. If I binge, I'm still supposed to eat the meals I'd planned. I'm not supposed to judge myself at this stage, but merely to keep accurate and timely records.  I keep a separate sheet for every day, so that I can see both what I planned to eat and what I actually ate. Some days are definitely better than others. Now that I've been doing this for a week, I can see that I'm a lot better at breakfasts and lunches than later in the day; I eat more sensibly when I'm in my kitchen than in my office; and I'm seriously rebelling against planning my meals in advance.  This is just step 1 of a 6-step plan, and I'm not supposed to move on to the next step until I'm reasonably adept at this one. Given that I haven't written down anything I've eaten yet today, and I'm going to be out and about for the next few days (which makes meal planning more difficult), I think I'll need to keep doing this step for at least another week.  One more thing I'm supposed to do on this plan is to weigh myself once a week. This might be difficult, since I threw away my bathroom scales over 20 years ago now. But I can see the sense in weighing myself more regularly. It's time to face up to the numbers on the dial. Not to scare myself or punish myself, but to know the truth and put myself in a better position to deal with it. The dietitian suggested that I could weigh myself fortnightly instead of weekly, using one of those pay-your-weight machines that you sometimes find in chemist shops. Not a bad idea, that.  A friend of mine who reads this blog from time to time suggested a while ago that I should post my weight here on an ongoing basis. I didn't want to do it at the time, but now I think it's a good idea. If this blog is truly about my journey towards health and fitness, it only seems right to let anyone who drops by know precisely where I'm at along the way. So if I haven't posted a weight update for more than a fortnight, please feel free to give me a nudge. Bigger or smaller, I'll keep you posted.

      1. When you feel hungry and it isn't time to eat, cleaning your teeth is a good alternative.  2. When what you really want is chocolate, a fisherman's friend is no substitute.

      The plan I’ve decided to follow applies more readily to bulimics of a normal weight than to binge eaters with a weight problem. It can be difficult for overweight people, because it’s all about ditching the diet and giving up any avoidance of particular foods. The theory is that dieting and food avoidance are two of the major strategies that trigger binge eating, and thus they need to be banished for good. Hallelujah, say I. Since I haven’t been avoiding any particular foods for many years now (other than foods I don’t actually like), I don’t think there will be much risk of a weight gain for me. But the mileage of other overweight binge eaters may vary, I am not a doctor, and other clichéd caveats. This is my blog, and I am speaking personally.

      My anonymous correspondent has suggested (in a response to my previous entry) that people are more likely to keep commitments to other people because of the consequences. I can’t comment on how true that might be for others, but I’m pretty sure it’s not the case for me. In many cases the consequences of failing to keep a commitment to myself far outweigh those of failing to keep a commitment to someone else. Most people are a good deal more forgiving than I am, for example. For me, I think it's much more likely to be an issue of self-worth than of consequences. That’s one of the reasons why I’m working on the self-worth thing. I’m also working on the forgiveness thing. And as for whether I’m working on the weight loss thing, I’ve had an important breakthrough this week.  On Tuesday I was due to be accompanying my partner to London for something important, but I was too sick to go. I’d eaten something on Monday night that had disagreed with me, and had to spend the whole of Tuesday within sprinting distance of a bathroom. I was really pissed off that I had to miss the occasion, and I was also pissed off about spending the whole day with gut ache. It’s been a long time since I’ve experienced that degree of hyper-awareness about my digestive system for that length of time, and it was extremely uncomfortable. So I gave myself a good listening to. I heard my frustration. I heard my anger. I heard my pain. And then, when I’d finished complaining to myself, I asked myself what I wanted. And I waited until I was able to give me an answer.  While waiting for my answer here, in the timeline of this narrative, I’ll talk about a book I’ve been reading over the last few weeks. It’s called Overcoming Binge Eating, by Doctor Christopher Fairburn, and it’s about binge eating disorder. It was lent to me by one of my counsellors when I told her that I saw my eating as a form of self-harm. Neither of us really thought I had binge eating disorder, but she thought I might like the book anyway. And she was right.  Fairburn’s book strongly agrees with something that I started becoming aware of over 20 years ago: dieting is a bad idea, and only exacerbates the kinds of problems that are associated with binge eating. That’s right: in case anybody still doubts it, there is now an impressive body of research showing that dieting facilitates binge eating.  I used to diet in my teens and early twenties, when I was a little bit overweight but a long way from obese. I became fatter in my mid twenties, read Suzie Orbach’s Fat is a Feminist Issue, realised that dieting was causing me a lot of problems, and gave it up. What I unfortunately did not do at that time was learn to eat sensible food in sensible portion sizes at regular mealtimes. To this day, I still have difficulty with that (for a number of complicated and convoluted reasons, some of which may well become clearer as this blog unfolds).  There has been very little research into the issue of binge eating in the obese population, so the book was geared more towards bulimics. Although I have never been bulimic (or anorexic), I recognised through reading Fairburn’s book that – in addition to all of my other issues around food – I still do have problems with binge eating.  The book ended with a detailed self-help plan for curing binge eating (based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), which for other reasons I don’t have a lot of truck with), and instructions on how to check your body mass index (BMI), the only accurate way of knowing how healthy your body weight is. There were also tables to check whether you’re overweight or underweight, including precise definitions for every cut-off point from ‘seriously underweight’ to ‘seriously overweight’. (For the record, with a BMI of more than 40, I am, officially, seriously overweight.) The food monitoring sheet suggested in the book was of precisely the same design as the one originally given to me by my dietitian, which piqued my curiosity. But that was about all, until Tuesday evening, and my answer to the question that I asked myself here five paragraphs ago.  So, what was it that I told myself I wanted? I asked myself to follow the CBT-inspired plan to deal with my binge eating problems. And yesterday morning I started doing precisely that. (To my anonymous correspondent: this is an example of a commitment to myself that I have every intention of keeping.)

      I visited some old friends this weekend. One of our conversations led me to recognise something important about commitment. I realised that I’m very good at honouring my agreements with other people. I’m also pretty good at making sure that others honour their agreements with me. But when it comes to the commitments I make to myself, I don’t seem to be anywhere near as honourable. I find it so much easier to renege on a promise I make to myself than to someone else, and I’m wondering what that says about my sense of self-worth. More specifically, I’m wondering if I make commitments to myself that I have no intention of keeping, or if I do intend to keep them but don’t think I’m worth the effort. I suspect that I’ve been guilty on both counts.  So here’s a declaration: from now on, I shall only make commitments to myself that I have every intention of honouring. And here’s another: if I notice myself reneging on a commitment to myself, I will call myself on it. I will treat myself with the same amount of respect and accountability as I treat others. I will forgive myself for lapses, just as I would with anyone else, but – again, just as with anyone else – I won’t allow myself to treat me like shit.  This feels like an important decision.

      My anonymous correspondent (whom I now know to be a 29-year-old male New Yorker) has sent me another comment, which I’ll get to later in the week, but for now here’s the last paragraph of his previous comment that I’d like to respond to.  “I hope you get angry, and wake up every morning with a fire in your fat belly, ready to head to the gym and shed the wait. I also know that gyms are shitty places: everyone looking at everyone else…staring…but don’t let that stop you. That’s never going to go away. You’re profile says you’re 44. You could have a lot of years ahead of you (if the fat doesn’t kill you). Take 3 or 4 years to loose the wait and you’ll still be young enough to party hard for a decade or two…”  He wishes me anger on a daily basis, but I’d prefer to resolve my problems with love and understanding. I believe there is too much anger in this world. I want to love my fat away, not fight it away. I want to thank it for the ways in which it has helped me up to now. I want to understand the messages it has for me, so that I can deal with them in different ways. I want to honour my excess weight and send it away with fondness and affection, not just evict it like some heartless bailiff. My fat has served me well, and I’m grateful for that, even though I no longer require its services. I believe that I now have the strength to live a slimmer life, but that wasn’t always the case. My fat has protected me from other demons, and I thank it for that. I now believe I’m strong enough to face those demons on my own, and I invite them to come and test me.  My gym is not, for the most part, a shitty place. People of all ages and sizes exercise there, and staring is rarely a problem. It’s the kind of place where everyone has their own fitness agenda, and that’s what they get on with. I dislike it when it gets overly crowded, smelly and noisy, but for the most part I go at the quieter times. I liked it a lot better when I used to go with my friend, last year, and I’m hoping that another friend or two might sign up before the summer is out.  I believe I have a lot of years left in me, and I would like to live them as comfortably and healthily as I can. It isn’t death I fear, but an unlived life.

      A good friend of mine who read my blog a couple of days back advised me not to take too much notice of what anonymous people say. If by this he means that I shouldn’t let it worry me, I’d like to assure him that it doesn’t. But if he means that I should ignore anonymous responses, I don’t (necessarily) agree with him.  I think my anonymous correspondent has given me a great gift. He or she has spoken freely, without fear of being named and shamed, some of the thoughts that doubtless swim about in many a head out there. It’s a privilege to have those words in front of me, where I can both experience their impact and analyse their content.  I probably encouraged some of those words by not flying off the handle in response to his or her initial comment. Although it looked like an insult and felt like an insult, and even ultimately turned out to have been intended as an insult, by allowing for an alternative interpretation I was able to solicit sufficient clarification for another whole week’s worth of journal entries. Had I either ignored the original comment or responded in anger or defensiveness I doubt whether I would have been so fortunate. Leaping to negative conclusions can stifle potentially rewawrding exchanges.  One of my tasks before I lose a considerable amount of weight is to live as a fat person in a world in which all manner of individuals have opinions about fat people, be they positive or negative. I will never know what most of them think, but it is good to have an example of at least one of those viewpoints. I may need to develop a stronger sense of self-esteem as a fat person before I’ll be completely willing to release my excess weight. I'm hoping that my creation of this blog, and my interaction with its readers, will help me to do that.

      My anonymous correspondent also said: “Fatness is a relative thing. Supermodels are hot. Playboy models are even hotter. Playboy models are generally bigger than fashion models. You put one next to the other and the Playboy model might even look “large”…but she’ll still be attractive. Fat people…well, who wants to look at a fat, hairy tub of lard…ever?”  Fat is a relative term, as my correspondent notes at the beginning of this paragraph, but forgets by the end. How fat does one have to be in order to qualify as a “fat, hairy tub of lard”, for example? And how about fat, balding tubs of lard – are they somehow “hotter” than the hairy kind?  But now I’m poking fun at my correspondent without making my own meaning clear, which is unkind of me.  So let’s take the term “hot” (which I take to mean “fanciable” as opposed to “overly warm”). Is that not also a relative term – or at least a subjective term? I’ve seen larger bodied people of both sexes whom I can think of as fanciable, and likewise with smaller bodied people. Is this not a case of beauty being in the eye of the beholder?  But perhaps my correspondent is talking nomothetic as opposed to idiographic, in which case I concede his or her point. It’s likely that a statistically significant proportion of the general population in Britain or America would consider a person of slim or average weight to be more attractive than a person of much larger than average weight. (I know it’s a bit of a stretch to get to this from fat, hairy tubs of lard… but I can be flexible.)  And it’s that final sentence which makes it crystal clear that we’re in insultsville again. My correspondent arbitrarily redefines a fat person as a “fat, hairy tub of lard”, setting up a straw man, and it would be hard to disagree with his or her proposition as stated. However, if you remove the sting and rephrase the question as “who wants to look at a fat person… ever?”, and count me as a fat person, you'd get a very different answer. I could (but won’t) give you a list of names.  And I haven’t even started on the relative importance of being looked at, as compared with what-all else one might have as one’s priorities in life - but don’t worry, I’m not going to go there today.

      Still chewing over the meat in my anonymous correspondent’s comments, today I want to see where the following paragraph takes me: “I think that fat people are look down upon. I don’t know why. Everyone’s got a weakness, a defect, an issue…and people are looked down upon because of such things. Maybe it’s a survival instinct…people (healthy or unhealthy) are repulsed by unhealthy people (of course, this is a generalization, but I think it’s generally true).”  Generalisations have their place. I think it would be very hard to process all the information that bombards us on a daily basis without recourse to stereotypes and personal prejudices. My correspondent has it right: it’s very likely that fat people are looked down upon, in most societies, in general.  And yet – and yet – I want to identify with the underdog. I want to stand with the oppressed. I, with my articulacy and intelligence and persistence, can do great work here. Why should fat people (or old people, gays, people of colour, disabled people, those of minority faiths, and whatever all else) be looked down upon? I, with my huge belly and my huge brain, can educate the oppressors. I, single-handedly, can show them the craziness of their ways....  Hah! Whose job is this? Whose craziness?  Maybe I, as a healthy person, no longer carrying excess weight, will live my life in such a way as to demonstrate to other healthy people that there is nothing repulsive about the fat or otherwise unhealthy among us. But how will I be able to do that if I have given up my own fat and unhealthy lifestyle? Surely a decision to leave all that behind implies a sense of unacceptability, perhaps even of repulsion....  Does the success of my own quest for health and fitness lie in the resolution of this dilemma? I think it might.

      In the second paragraph of my anonymous correspondent's most recent response, he or she said: "Look, I'm sure it's hard to loose weight. Especially if your so fat that you want to loose half of your body weight. And, from what I’ve read so far on your blog, I don’t pity you for the situation you’re in."  Which is great, because pity is not a response that I'm seeking at all. Understanding, yes. Empathy, yes. But pity? Pity is something that I find disempowering.  Self-pity may be one of the reasons why I developed this weight problem in the first place. Feel angry? Afraid to speak out? Have some more sweets. Fed up? Tired? Eat another bar of chocolate. Things getting on top of you? Does it all seem hopeless? Never mind, have a second helping of your favourite pudding.  Pitying someone is like feeding them after they’re already full.  If anyone reading this does pity me, I'd like to invite you to go beyond your pity and examine what lies underneath. Perhaps you feel superior to me, in that you don't have a weight problem yourself, and never have done. Maybe you feel judgemental of me, because I must lack moral fibre (or whatever) to end up weighing twice as much as I would like. Or possibly you feel a glimmer of understanding, a twinkle of "had circumstances been different, that could have been me". And perhaps that recognition scares you.  It is there, in that recognition, that I wish to meet you. It is in that recognition that the rational side of me needs to meet the overweight side of me; to understand what the overweight part needs, and lovingly enable those needs to be met, so that carrying all this weight is no longer necessary.  My rational side doesn't yet know why any of this weight is necessary. But I'm listening. Watching, and waiting, and looking for clues. And participating in this blog. And hoping.

      I was interested in finding out what someone's reasons might be for posting an insulting comment to my new blog, and I'm grateful to my correspondent for not ducking my question. His or her response began: "An insult just seemed fitting. I read your entry and reacted. The anonymity of the Internet removed the usual societal norm, which makes most people tolerate fat people."  One of my reasons for publishing this blog pseudonymously was to embrace the anonymity of the Internet. People who know me well may be able to identify me – I have mentioned my first name, and Rainbow Fury is not a new pseudonym – but I have not publicised the existence of this blog very widely. I am writing here on a single issue, and don't intend Concentration to become a general blog about what's going on in my life. The only people I have expressly told about its existence so far are those whom I know to be supportive. I expect to tell more people about it as time goes on, including those whom I have experienced as less supportive. I also know that other people may come across it by other means than my own word of mouth. I set it up that way on purpose. Happenstance is a wonderful thing.  Having said all that, I find it hard to understand how an insult can seem like a fitting response. I can certainly appreciate the existence of a reaction, and I'm pleased to have provoked a series of responses that I can engage with. I do understand someone's honest feelings of disgust (which is my interpretation of the source of the reaction), and I'm honestly pleased that it's out there, in the open, where I can see it and feel its impact. More than anything, I appreciate the fact that this person and I are now having an open dialogue.  Winding back to the original insult, though: I'm concerned about what it is that facilitates the expression of an ad-hominem comment like that from behind a cloak of anonymity. Is it only the existence of societal norms that allows fat people to be tolerated? If such norms were to be dissolved overnight, would the larger bodied amongst us be unanimously villified? My hunch is that the answer would be no.  I think it is the very existence of societal norms that allows minorities to be oppressed. Norms which, in 1950s America, held that black people were inferior to whites; or, in 1930s Germany, that Jews were inferior to Aryans. Even today we can see many forms of oppression that are sanctioned by societal norms.  If a toddler should point at me and make a comment about the fat lady, I appreciate this innocent reaction far more than the knowing shushing of its mother. It is that very shushing which plants the seeds of perceived wrongness in the toddler's mind. The child learns two things: overtly, that it is wrong to comment about someone's fatness; and, covertly, that it is wrong to be fat. If there were any way in which societal norms could convey the former without the latter, I would be in favour of them. As it is, I am not.  So I publish anonymously on the Internet, and I welcome anonymous responses. I embrace the existence of a society in which all the usual norms are set aside. I believe this place can foster exploration and growth, precisely because of the lack of those controls. And I'm willing to test that belief.

      My anonymous correspondent has sent me a veritable banquet of comments – far too much food for thought for me to manage in a single sitting. The whole meal can be found in the comments to my entry "A reader writes". I will select bite-sized portions to chew over during the week ahead. Thank you, whoever you are, wherever you are. I really appreciate you for this.

      It was great to spend a couple of hours with my friend again and catch up on old times. One chunk of our conversation leapt out at me, and I want to make a note of it here, so that I don't forget.  She and I have got into this pattern where neither of us calls the other very often. Every time we talk we're on the phone for a couple of hours, give or take, and both of us are very busy people. It's hard to set aside a chunk of time like that, and neither of us wants to cut the other one short. The talks we have are great. And then I made a connection with eating, which is the bit that I don't want to forget.  Banquets are wonderful things, but it's much smarter to have smaller, regular meals more frequently.  My friend got the analogy in an instant, and I think we'll be talking to each other a bit more often now. We'll be saving things for later rather than trying to cram everything into one extended phonecall. Just like I hope I learn to do with food.  I noticed that my friend - super fit, and not particluarly large to start with - had lost weight since the last time I'd seen her. She looked wonderful!

      Today I met one of my former flatmates for the first time in nine months. It was great to see her again. She was the person who first introduced me to the gym.  (Here’s where I want a wibbly wobbly font to indicate the clock winding back a year. You’ll just have to imagine that bit.)  She told me she was going to check out a new gym the next day. When I asked if I could come along too, she almost fell off her chair. My request wasn’t really in character. But along I went, and I was astonished to find that the place looked really nice and didn’t smell of sweat and Ralgex. Her enthusiasm was infectious; she assured me she’d show me how all the scary machines worked, and I signed up on the spot.  For the next three months we went to the gym quite a lot – sometimes together, more often at different times. She showed me how the machines worked. Sometimes we swam. I signed up for Yoga and Tai Chi classes. And then she moved away.  I carried on going to the gym pretty frequently for another three months. Then Christmas came. I was away for a week and lost touch with my routine. The next time I went back I lost my mobile phone. That shook me.  I plucked up the courage to go back again in January. Have you ever been to a gym in January? The place was heaving! Teeming with the grunting, sweating bodies of people who all seem to have resolved to melt away their excess lard in record time. I was horrified. I felt uncomfortable. It didn’t feel safe there any more. I didn’t go back again for weeks.  Between then and now I’ve been to the gym about three times a month. That compares with three to five times a week last summer and autumn. It's time to start going back there more often. But here I sit, typing my story into a computer instead. Hmmmmm....

      In July 2003 I promised myself that I would lose half of my then bodyweight over the next two years. Despite some initial successes, in June 2004 my weight reached a higher point than ever before.  There's something going on here, and I don't know what it is. I intend this blog to be the verbal equivalent of shining a bright light into all the nooks and crannies that stand between me and my goal. I am ready to examine and release whatever is blocking my path, and I'm ready to have a good time along the way.  * * * * * * * *  I was originally going to put those two paragraphs in my colophon (or whatever those little subheading-type thingies are known as around these parts), but then I decided to put a leaner version up there instead.   I still want to say them somewhere, though. Here might be as good a place as any.

      I’m still thinking about whether I want to embrace the term Fatso. And I’m still thinking that my answer is No.  Fatso tends to be an insulting term directed towards a fat person, whereas Fat can be a purely descriptive term. Of course it’s possible for Fat to be used as an insult – it’s possible to use practically any word as an insult – but I don’t see how Fatso can be used as anything else.  That, for me, is where the differentiation lies.

      An anonymous comment arrived in my e-mail this morning. It asked: Do you only want to reclaim "fat"? Or do you also want to reclaim "fatso".  That's an interesting question.  My immediate response is that I'm not very fond of "fatso": I felt insulted when I first read that e-mail. This could have been because of its anonymity, its brevity and directness, the word "fatso"; all three, or none of the above. I'd really like to know what triggered my "feel insulted" button, but I don't. I can generate a zillion conjectures from my head, though I know those don't help.  As I re-read the e-mail a couple of times, I began to feel a lot more comfortable. I started to feel pleased that someone had taken the time to send me a comment, and that my brand new baby blog had found itself a reader already, with no help from its mother. The comment was germane and to the point: there were no wasted words, and the intention behind it could be interpreted as kind and supportive just as easily as hurtful and insulting. Any perceived intent on the part of the sender was being generated by me, not by the person on the other end of the electrons.  So now I want to thank my anonymous correspondent for giving me the food for this entry, and to invite other readers to comment as and when they choose.  It feels great to be seen and heard.

      When I was first in therapy I would not allow my therapist to refer to my weight. I bristled when he dared to suggest that I might be a little bit on the large side. Who I am is more important than what I look like.  But maybe a couple of years back I started to melt a little. Yes, we can talk about my weight now. But don’t call me overweight – that would imply some judgement or criticism of my current weight, some need to be something other than I am. Call me something descriptive, something non-judgemental. Call me fat.  Why not? The gay community reclaimed "queer"; why can't we larger bodied people reclaim "fat" as a positive descriptive term?  So I'm fat, and proud. Even as I pursue my goal of a slimmer body and a healthier lifestyle, I still want to identify as fat. And yet I wonder if there's something in this very wish for identification that is preventing me from losing the weight I want to lose. Like the non-Jews in Nazi Germany who wore yellow stars in support of their Jewish brothers and in defiance of the party line, effectively proclaiming their own Jewishness, I want to declare in a very visible way that I support and affirm the rights and experiences of fat people. I are one. Even when I'm not. And there's the rub. Because I are one, I don't seem to be able to be not one as well. I want to find a comfortable solution to this paradox.
