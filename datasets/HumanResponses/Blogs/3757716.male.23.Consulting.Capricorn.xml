      Hey, everybody. Me again.  'Cause of the nature of this site, and the new posts every now n' then, I'm gonna post some of my old columns from my website. (sniff) Goodbye, hawkbatdesign.com.  5/4/04   Yeah, just another Tuesday.       Think I have Pneumonia again. Took me a while to get out of bed, even though I had a meeting to go to at noon. And I've been hacking flem like it's going out of style. And sneezing, too. Luckily, I'm not sneezing all over something when it happens.       So, enough about me.       Wait. This is about me. Huh.       Anyway, just watched some Azumanga Daioh for a few days. I have no idea what it is about this show, but it's one of my favorite anime series now. Right up there with Bebop and FLCL. Well, FLCL is a recent addition as well, and there's only six episodes, compared to Bebop and A.D.'s 26 each. But there's nothing wrong with it! It's graphic at times(FLCL, that is), and the themes are always adult-oriented, but (crap, am I getting off-topic. I'd better wrap this up quick.) in conclusion, these are series that are good.(there.)       Later in the day, after the first meeting, Jack, Blackie and I went to (insert generic discount bookstore name here) to scout what we want to put in the bookroom when it's done. To begin with, we checked series availability on our competition's shelves, and they had quite a bit of DragonLance, which we have a lot of as well, so, bases covered. We ruled out getting novels of Buffy, Mechwarrior, Babylon 5, and Star Trek(at least for a while), and chose to add some Mystery(some gray-area stuff, like psychic detectives and things). Then we noticed they have quite a manga selection(larger than ours), so we added that to the list. And their Horror section was mixed in with the regular fiction, so we're going to keep ours separate.       After our recon mission, we ate at (insert chain mall family-style restaurant), and discussed Blackie's previous DM weirdness. I won't go into much detail because there's a lot of subject matter. Anyway, it was all about her group trying their damnedest to derail.       The actual meeting was good, because for most of it, it was just us three, then Mr. Manager man sorta interspersed every few minutes 'cause he was busy. Mark quit on Sunday, but it wasn't a surprise. We knew it was going to happen either before or after that Sunday's meeting. Yeah, either we have too many meetings at once, or we have none for a long time. Crazy.       Went for a walk with Devorah, my neighbor, the one with the insane cat, who tries to kill me. Kinda weird, 'cause this one character in Azumanga Daioh has the same experience with one cat every day. Tries to pet it, be nice, y'know, but gets attacked. Funny, but sadly relatable.       Haven't seen the season finale of Tru Calling yet, but I recorded it. Just saving it, I guess.       Just noticed how much a background song on Inu-Yasha sounds like the Star Trek battle music from that episode where Kirk has to fight Spock. Speaking of unrelated things, who likes Muk-Luks?

      Well, this is it. Today is the day that I get back into gaming for real. Unfortunately, it's not tabletop. Well, sorta, but not really. I  will  be rolling dice, but it's a instant message thing, so there's no real human interaction here. Just floating electrons hurtling through space pretending to be people. I could cheat, but that's cheating me(I sound so responsible, don't I?), 'cause I haven't gamed for a year now.   The last gaming I did was I played a Buffy campaign, a short one, and this is the same GM. He's in Korea, and I could be gaming if I wanted to, but I'm either too lazy or too shy to actually get off my ass and ask someone if I could join in. Kinda my outlook on dating. Surprise!  So today I'm playing a Vampire game. The Masquerade, specifically. Well, to begin with, I'm going to start as a human, a mafia hug, really. Then I suppose I get turned. Or something. I dunno. Haven't played a game like this before. Not like I've never played a World of Darkness game or anything, just not Vampire.   And it's in about...45 minutes, so I'm gonna get ready. I don't need to shave or anything, just finding my character sheet, and dice. Oh, there they are. Sitting next to the computer.  Wish me luck!  Herph

      There comes a time, as is the course of all things(be it bellbottoms, wrist rockets, or milk), to expire.   As of this week, I will no longer have my very own web page. Not that I was doing much with it anyway. I had a few links to IMDB and Google, some columns, and a nice-looking logo. The logo is still mine, by the way. So, anyway, in a few days time, www.hawkbatdesign.com will be no more. Yahoo sent a notification on the 24th saying I had a week to pay off the monthly fee, so I waived it. Didn't Geocities give out web sites free back in the day? Now that they're owned by the big 'Y', they got all corporate.   Don't mind me, gripe coming through.   And, weirdly enough, though I spent more time and effort on creating my website, with the pasting and the positioning and the pretty colors, I feel more connected to this one, the Calf, which took me a grand total of three minutes to make, 'cause it was a pre-made template site. Plus I get to make these little comments here, real easily, and they show up like nothing! I don't have to link them anywhere! As my friend Anthony's fruit roll-up equivalent said, "Poof! Magic!" Little web gnomes are hard at work to deliver the bits and bytes for your monitor elves to interpret and draw backwards upon your screen(yes, Virginia, this is why your computer lags).   So, as is the custom in my culture, to mourn loss of fundamentally worthless things, I bid a farewell to hawkbatdesign.com, to its peach background and pinkish crisscross bars, the outlined logo, and all of the little files I had to create(that are floating somewhere in the abyss as we speak) to get it where it is now.   Godspeed(someone, somewhere, is playing Amazing Grace on bagpipes. The only way bagpipes can be played).  Herph

      Heh. Lured you, didn't I? Well, I should hope so. This is what I do, luring. Not in the biblical sense, though. Just with eye-catching titles like this one.   Yeah, I'm not sure what it means. I thought it sounded cool, though. So, here it is.   And yeah, this isn't exactly a breeding ground for excellent writing or anything, just my small chunk of the world, relevant or no.

      Okay, here we are, down to the wire. Bottom of the ninth, 10 seconds left on the shotclock and 3 more yards to a first down. This jumbling of sports references is to mark the very last two weeks until we have to move out of this apartment. As it is with most things, I have procrastinated. Quite a bit. I probably could've found a place within the first week of June if I wanted to. But now, the pickin's will be slim, because of the dreaded Return of the College Students all the old people that live in the east end worry about all year long. I can see their problem now. Umpteen campus mites parade in any given fall semester, swoop down with their big bags of money, and wrestle homeowners to the ground with their demands of cheap-rented apartments. Then they trip the elderly and steal the medicine, because robots use it as fuel. So, if any residents out there can hear my voice, this is an S.O.S. to any sane landlords in Duluth that wish to rent a three-bedroom place(possibly a duplex) to a few slacker townies with full-time jobs for less than $800 per month(ideally). Hopefully pets are okay(please?), since there is a mild-mannered neutered male, whose full-time job, it seems, is to sometimes lay on the floor, or perhaps lay on a bed. Or even sit on the couch, as a rebel cat would. I realize that this is probably a shot in the dark(loud noise, no one sees where it's coming from), but I'm desperate. Drop me a line?

      You ever have that favorite glass, or cup, or mug or whatever, that you refuse to wash because it'll take too long, and you may miss another opportunity to fill it up? I've had a variety of them. A few years ago, when I was still in high school, I had a grey, plastic cup, one that I had found at a gas station. You know, one of those tall ones, like you get when you buy like, 50 gallons of pop, but a generic one, very plain grey. I had a holster for it too, a belt clip I bought for holding my prop lightsaber. To convert my cup for easy access without having to carry it  and  books and stuff, I stuck a keyring on the handle, and clipped it to my belt. Eventually, I lost the cup, but it's not really gone, as long as I remember the way it lived(*sniff*). Then, I had a blue one, and a red one, just tall, plain-looking cups, and oddly colored. They only served their purpose, I really didn't feel anything about them. But their loss still hit me. Recently, I've had a tall, plain-looking green one. Like a neon green, it nearly keeps me up during the day, it's so bright. But as with my other cups, it's used to hold only water. I really don't understand the coffee thing, I'd rather drink something that's not pushing my stress levels up and forcing me awake, thank you. Not that the water here is anything fantastic. It's kinda hard, and a little fluoridic(is that a word?). But it's water, and fulfills my requirement. One day, I'm sure I'll lose the green one, as I have with the others. On that day, I shall go out and buy a new cup, as a way of remembering the great loyalty and strength shown to me by its predecessor.  Herph

      The last column(actually, the first) of my old, dearly departed website, hawkbatdesign.com. (Sniff) We hardly knew ye.  Well, this is the first of many, I hope. Knowing that people perhaps like to keep track of me, I am going to write columns, possibly weekly ones, about random stuff. Could be about me, other things, whatever I feel like ranting about at the moment.    For example, today, I did my laundry, which really needed to be done, because Matt's cat Sebastian puked on my comforter. Twice. So, I went to my parents and, of course, was assaulted with too much food. I swear to God, my mother is turning into my Grandma. And my dad, having two of them, gave me his gigantic recorder (the flute-ish kind) and a couple books on learning the recorder.  Now, this is not a regular kind of recorder. As mentioned before, this thing is MASSIVE. Like two feet long. Or, maybe a foot-and-a-half, more like that. So, I try it out, and of course I have no idea what I'm doing with the damned thing. Most of the time I have it in my hands I'm trying to figure out where to put my fingers. And I don't know how much air to blow into it, or how to put my lips around it. And for most of you, this is funny because it sounds like I'm describing someone else's penis. And now I've made you uncomfortable. Well, good. Take that, science class.    So, anyway, I look in one of the books and find out how to work it, and it's not the right model in the description. So, good, I have no idea what I'm doing. I take a guess and it pretty much works, so I go with it. A couple pages later in the book, they have a sample song you can play, using the first note you learn, B. Now, I'm no teacher, but as an ametuer musician, I'm pretty sure most songs must have at least two different notes in them. I might be wrong, but the first two songs only use B as a note. I play one, not moving my fingers, because it's the same note over and over. Just blowing into it, and it sounds like crap. Not because I can't play it (see above), but because someone wrote an actual song using one note. It sounds a lot like this: Doot, doot, doot doot doot, doot, doot, doot doot doot. This is not music. This is one note over and over pretending to be music. It sounds like I'm trying to send morse code, for God's sake. And they have horrible names for these one-note songs, too. 'My Kayak'. 'Winter Song'. 'Autumn is Coming', crap like that. Then, at last, a few pages later, they introduce another note. 'A'. So, now I know two notes, A & B. You'd think the songs would improve, but they don't. Instead of sounding like doot, doot, doot, now it's doot, deet, doot. Doot, deet, doot. Doot doot, deet deet, doot, deet, doot. Still crap.    So, I do my laundry and come home, and my neighbor Devorah calls me up and wants to hang out. So I go next door, hang out, watch a couple of movies, but all the while her cat Chai is watching me and hissing. I look over and she's, like, scowling at me. I try and pet her, and I get scratched. I pull my hand away and she bites it. Finally, tired of getting scratched and bit, I pick her up, and she's furious. She lunges at my face and hits my lip with her claw, ripping it open. It was like someone gouged a chunk of flesh out of my lip. Blood was all over my lip, Chai's paw, and my hands. Devorah locked Chai up in one of those cat-carriers as I tended to my lip. So now, even though I've had a horrible experience with cats today, I come home and grab Sebastian, even though he vomited on my comforter, and hug him. It's kinda cathartic to see an evil cat, then come home to a happy, affectionate pair of cats. Even though they're not mine.

      Life, as we know it, is strange. There's intervals of time that seem to pass either faster or slower without acknowledgement. Items that you once had and/or cherished disappear and we take no notice. Animals sense danger, evil and perhaps the fate of loved ones and we sit uncaring or unwilling to question. Death approaches ever nearer, and yet, we heed no warnings. As they say, 'Que sera, sera.' But to act upon, study, linger in thought within these topics is sick, and disturbing. Well, so is my use of commas, but I digress. It's funny how everyone slants toward a life that may or may not mean anything in the long run, could or couldn't be considered a failure, will or will not leave a lasting impression upon the world as we know it, or history as we write it. Life, as a collection of experiences, is faulty. Because once these experiences are through being collected, there might not be anyone left to remember them. Which is why we put a strut in our steps, sneer at the ugly people, trip and fall down stairs, laugh at bad jokes, and generally become a nuisance to everyone around us. Otherwise, the alternative is to seek refuge in a bottomless chasm of fear and paranoia, only looking back out long enough to see the wreck the world is, the horrible atrocities performed by our leaders and ourselves, and maybe grab a cold one and go back to a false sense of reality, one that pats you on the head and says, "Great job, friend! You're important! You may just be someone that matters!" Or maybe I'm just really tired. And worn out from staring at:  "Because I am not planted in the ground. I am held upright on a plate of cold granite."  - urlLink Atarikeiko

      Well, things have settled. Life is good. Cable works, which means everything works. Blue Monday #2 came out, so I've been reading it like mad, though it's only one issue. And the Devorah situation seems to have resolved itself, finally. She's apparently hung up on me, but she's not looking for a serious relationship. Just a casual, fling-thing. Which, to me, is death. Any woman that wants to have a serious relationship out there, please raise your hand. Anyone? Oh, well. Doesn't matter. I've gone this long without dating, so I can go longer. Bored tonight. Not much going on, besides me typing here at the lonely box™(yep, that's what I call it. It's copyrighted, too). Might hang out with my sister, might just sit here and dick around for the night. It gets boring after a while. Damn you, internet!

      Well, I'm done moving in now. It only took a few days, then I had to set everything up, like the computer and my T.V. and stuff. Then the cable got set up on Wednesday, so I had to deal with that too. So, proving from this post, the internet works, but not on my computer. Isn't it wonderful? The router dosn't seem to like my computer, or the cable or something, so I have to shell out some cash for a new network cable, one that's at least 40" long, so I can string it to my room from Chris'. But, since Chris works usually during the day, I get free reign over his computer while he's gone. Whee. My IM-ing isn't on this computer, and I'd rather not set it up 'cause what's the point? Once I get the cable, I'll just have to throw it out anyway. What else? Hmm. Oh, I don't know. I suppose that's it. Hooray.

      So, finally, after an exhaustive search of Duluth and the surrounding area, we found an apartment at the last minute(*phew*). I'm pretty much moved in. Most of my junk, electronics and such are hooked up, but the cable won't be up 'till Wednesday. So, I'll be pretty bored for two days, just watching some stock anime I have. Sebastian is still at the old place for now, but he'll be moved in by tonight. The old place looks  really  empty. Y'know, except for all of the garbage all over the place. In various bags and loosely scattered. The worst is over now, though. For me, anyway. Matt still has to move his big-ass couch up those stairs, and the biggest thing I have to worry about is where to put my loveseat. The place is nice, except there's a shower problem, with the water basically not coming out at all. And Chris is concerned about the toilet, but I doubt it's that big a deal. I mean, who spends that much time on the can, anyway? Devorah still has my Buffy season 4, might have to hunt her down for it.  Herph
