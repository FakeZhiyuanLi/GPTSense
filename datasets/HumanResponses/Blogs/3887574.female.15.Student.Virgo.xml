           Mood : Happy...and tired.   Listening To : Franco Un-American; NOFX  Today was slow, and I can't go to bed too too late because of my CAHSEE Math class tommorow. I was pleasently suprised to see that "I Love The 90's" came on TODAY and not TOMMOROW, so I got to see Dom early. He was dancing, it was damn funny, LOL.  Gah, don't do it Superman! He's at War World and has to fight Mongol and has to lose BADLY to him. J'onn is all weak and Hawk Girl & Green Lantern are looking for Superman now. I'd just like to say that The Flash is the best Justice League hero ever. LOL. The best superhero of ALL is of course Spiderman. Eww, Spiderman Unlimited is horrid. He has a FUCKING CAPE, ok? The hell, that's the GREATNESS of Spiderman, he doesn't have a cape like conventional superheroes. He's not like most superheros: he's a teenager with actual life problems. What other hero do you know like that? Not very many, 'cause Spiderman is different! Stan Lee didn't have anything to do with Spiderman UL, so it was just some lameass attempt at creativity. Looking pretty dumb, I'd say. LOL, I love superheros. :)  I need to diet. LOL  Man, it's really hot here. Kinda annoying. Ah, I forgot to link that wallpaper. LOL, I'll do it. Eventually. LOL. My cat is being odd. Haha, ok I think I'm done for now. Later.

           Listening To : Spongebob  Mood : Tired  There's this band I met named Straight Outta Junior High & I love them. I'm bored and I was gonna post my fave lyrics. ...but i've realized they have no lyrics online and I don't feel like typing them all out. *sigh* Oh well. I'll post something...interesting.  I'm happy! GC has 2 new songs and apparently, their new album is called " The Chronicles Of Life And Death ." I kinda think it's all up in the air, but I'm excited to hear some new material from them.   I'm thinking I should clean up my room soon so I can get my Merry and Pippin shirt.  My CD scared me, I didn't know there was a bonus track & it popped on out of nowwhere. My heart fluxuated, LOL.  Is it just me or does Elijah Wood's Frodo promo pics look awkward? Like he's uncomfotable or something. I don't know. EXAMPLE!:           That's just an odd pose to me; it doesn't look natural. His other pictures look good though. Maybe these are early Frodo pictures & he wasn't used to things yet.  I want to add a few more things to this page. I put a no-right click code, just because I don't want no one even TRYING to take my stuff. If I make something and I don't care who takes it, I'll put a text link to it. Because in fact, I'll probably make general graphics that I don't care if people have. I made a Elijah wallpaper the other day and I'll link that in the side panel along with some other things. I'm going to rest afterwards though. LOL, so that's it.

           Listening To : Hawthorne Heights - Silver Bullet  Mood : Bored & tired.  I changed the layout and man, it took  FOREVER . I'm very meticulous when it comes to layouts & stuff. I still think the text is took big but I'm too tired to fix it.  Ok, well I'm sitting around and listening to music. I'm very bored though. I'd watch FotR but I'm too lazy to start it up.   When I get online now and days, there's hardly anything to do. I look at most forums am in and then have nothing to do. I stopped posting at a lot of places and I feel bad but I just get bored. I was posting at LotR Plaza for a while and just got majorly bored. Now I'm bored everywhere else almost. I post @ IA Forums and these Dom boards I'm at, but still. Internet has lost it's luster!  I guess I always could work on my  urlLink LotR Directory  to keep me entertained, because there's a lot of stuff I need to add there anyhow, but eh. I don't feel like web building ALL the time. I'm a friggin' survey/quiz/whatever freak. I think I posted 5-6 surveys in my Xanga today alone, but it was really fun filling them out. I just took one of the Memgen's called " What ranDOM pic of Dominic Monghan are you? " and I got this picture:           He looks cute there. I just found a pic of him though. I know I gotta make a graphic with it now, LOL.           *glee* LOL, he's awesomely hot.  I just I should've mentioned how I screamed when my mom told me if I cleaned my room, she'd by me a  urlLink Merry & Pippin shirt  from Hot Topic. I think it's cute. They have a fucking Legolas pillowcase that I gotta get too, it's cute cute. I just need...money, LOL.  I think that's it. Um, yeah. I might post later. :)         Edit : I got something else worth posting, LOL;         You are Bouncy TRL Dom! Cheeky, hyper, and constantly moving, you bounced your way through your interview, humped Sean, danced like a crazy man, and stuck your butt in the air while jumping on a couch. We love you. We really, really do. Full throttle!    urlLink   Which Dominic Monaghan are you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

          K, so I was bored as hell, and I got 1 of THESE. I hope that uh, I don't know what I hope. This is my official "I'm an overly-obsessed Lord of the Rings fan and fuckin' proud of it" journal. So in otherwords, I'll post about myself (at times) but yeah, I'm gonna dwell on the greativity that is LOTR. :) I'll be back to post something highly obsessive real quick. LOL
