      Tomorrow is Lughnassadh, or Lammas, a pagan holiday that celebrates the harvest and the Sun God.  Not sure yet how I'll celebrate.  Make a feast for myself and my boyfriend, and then perhaps a small ritual for myself.  I need to go grocery shopping for this and clean up around the apartment.  -Marquette

      I'm so glad my summer job of teaching a health and wellness class for high school summer school is almost over.  Let me explain the program a little bit first before getting into my rant....  The Upward Bound program is actually a really cool program.  They have about 30 high school students who are college bound live in the dorms on campus and have their summer school classes on campus for five weeks.  They take science classes, math classes, Spanish, and English during the morning and early afternoon, have recreational activities during the evenings, and the wellness class that I teach three days a week during the evening as well.  Since my class is during the evening, the kids don't really consider it a "real" class, even though the director keeps reminding them they have to pass it in order to go on the trip to Minneapolis at the end of the program.   Alright, so there's a little background.  The director keeps saying how the wellness class is a "real" class, but ya know the ole' saying that actions speak louder than words?  It applies here as well.  Because for everything he says about the wellness class being a real class, he doesn't act like it.  For the awards banquet, all the teachers give academic awards, but traditionally the wellness teacher has never given an academic award.  A new member to the administration questioned that and so I got to give an academic award - but there was a lunch meeting where all the teachers got together and decided the awards together and I wasn't invited.  So come the night of the awards banquet, they all had these plans and spiels they worked on together and I knew nothing about it and kind of ended up winging the whole thing and looking stupid.  A member of the administration also made a memory book and a video - and guess who was the only person in the entire program not shown or mentioned in either one of them?  Yep, you guessed it - me!  And it bothers me as well that people always say "the academic classes and the wellness class."  Excuse me?!  I have a bachelor of science in health - as far as I'm concerned, it is an academic area as well.  Whatever.  I'm working for the program next summer anyway.  Alright, done with my rant.  -Marquette

      I got my first paycheck from Planned Parenthood today.  Only $150, but hey, that's cool.  First paychecks are always fun too.  So, yesterday I'm visiting one of my co-workers in her office and she handed me three pamphlets.  They're titled "What's Wrong with Contraception?," "The Pill - How does it work?  Is it safe?," and "A Chastity Manifesto."  Let me just quote some of the things that were printed in them...  From "What's Wrong with Contraception?"...  "In the man, vasectomy may cause health problems because of the necessity of the body to reabsorb sperm unable to leave it.  In the long term there is an increased risk of prostate cancer.  The sterilized woman is likely to suffer further gynecological consequences."  What a load of crap.  "The IUD, as a foreign body introduced into the normally sterile environment of the womb, can cause a chronic inflammation and reduced resistance to infections, which, if they get out of hand, can cause further illness including permanent sterility.  It is hardly used in the USA now because the manufacturers have been forced to pay large sums of compensation to users."  First of all, I wouldn't say IUDs are hardly used in the USA anymore.  There are two that I know of that are on the market, and I know we offer one of them at Planned Parenthood.  They are safe to use.  A few decades ago there was a brand of IUD that was taken off the market, but again, that was a long time ago and they're not used anymore.  "There are many harmful side-effects (of the pill) - mild, serious, and even fatal."  Well, all drugs have side effects.  When someone is put on a prescription drug, they should be told what those possible side effects are.  But the worse side effects of the pill are usually for women over 35 who smoke and have a history of things like blood clots - in which case most clinicians wouldn't put that woman on the pill anyway.  Besides, more people have probably died from the side effects of Tylenol than the pill.  But I don't see anyone trying to ban Tylenol.  "When a spermicide is used, there is an increased chance of a miscarriage or of the child being handicapped in the event of conception."  What the bull shit is this?  "The whole point of contraception is to enjoy sexual pleasure while eliminating the possibility of conceiving children."  Well, they finally got something right!  From "The Pill - How does it work?  Is it safe?"  "Is the pill safer than pregnancy?  No.  The health risks of the Pill outweigh by far the risks of pregnancy and childbirth to a woman's health, and any claim to the contrary is based on erroneous comparisons between healthy women on the Pill and women who do not receive normal care during pregnancy."  I think they are just blatantly lying at this point.  There are SO MANY risks to a woman's health during pregnancy and childbirth and to even try and compare using the pill to that and say the pill is more harmful is just ridiculous.   From "A Chastity Manifesto."  "There will be no wide-spread return to non-marital chastity without a rebirth of marital chastity.  It is easier to be chaste when married; married couples need to lead the way."  WHAT?!  Married couples shouldn't have sex?  What's the point of that?  And aside from that, I don't think there's anything inherintly wrong with non-married couples having sex.  I live with my boyfriend, thank you very much, and I don't feel I'm doing anything wrong at all.  Anyways, I could have put a ton more quotes on here, but this entry would end up being llloooonnnnggggg.  Plus, I'm really hungry and some Thai food is sounding good.  -Marquette

       All I watch, day in and day out, is CNN Headline News.&nbsp; It's the same shit over and over again.&nbsp; They don't cover the news I'm even interested in.&nbsp; But I can't stand FOX news, or all the news talk shows on other networks, so I guess I'm stuck with the headline news.&nbsp; At least there's the news ticker at the bottom with the sometimes funny and/or interesting little tidbits.&nbsp;   Currently, I'm working as an instructor for a high school health class - it's for a program called Upward Bound.&nbsp; It's basically summer school for high school kids who are college bound.&nbsp; They live in the dorms and have their classes on campus.&nbsp; This is my last week, and I'm excited it's almost over.&nbsp; When the program started, I was excited about the job, but quickly learned that being a teacher, at least a high school teacher, is not for me.&nbsp; It has been one of the most frustrating jobs I've ever had.&nbsp; I will be a teaching assistant for a university class this fall though.&nbsp; So far I'm pretty optimistic about it.&nbsp; I'll have a prof with me after all, so it should go smoothly.&nbsp;   Anyway, I've got things to do...  -Marquette

      Spent the weekend at my parent's house.  My boyfriend came with me and we pitched our tent in the yard.  It was okay.  Some of it was fun, some of it was frustrating.  Saw my sister and her new baby.  A baby's a baby - you've seen one, you've seen them all.  Today was my first full day at Planned Parenthood doing clinic by myself.  Everything went smoothly.  Everyone puts in long days though.  I was there for nine hours, which I guess isn't so bad, but there some days when people put in 11 hour days.  I can't imagine that.   -Marquette

      My boyfriend and I are going to my parent's house tonight to stay for the weekend.  My sister had a baby about two weeks ago, and she'll be there too.  My boyfriend and I are pitching a tent in the yard though - I won't stay in the house.  My parents don't let us sleep together when we stay there, but at least in the tent we could.  My parents are so funny - I live with my boyfriend, and I sleep with him every night here - why not at their house?  I'm hungry.  There's nothing to eat here.  I kind of want potatoes.  With cheese.  Mmmm.  That sounds really good right now.   I put up a sign on my deck yesterday that says "Pro-Kerry, Pro-Edwards, Pro-Choice."  I don't have a yard to put signs up in, so I put them on my deck facing the road instead.  -Marquette

      Well, I feel like I have a lot to say right now, so I guess I'll start with my trip from this Monday through Wednesday...  I went on a trip to Minneapolis (did I even spell that right?) with the Upward Bound program I worked for this summer.  30 high school kids and 10 adults on a bus for something like 10 hours...  not the funnest experience in the world.  We get to the city, check into our hotel, and go out for dinner.  I had some serious sinus pressure in my face and thought it was just allergies.  Oh no!  I'm really sick by that night, and spent all of Tuesday in bed in the hotel while the group went to the Science Museum, the zoo, and dinner theatre.  Wednesday I'm still sick, but we checked out of the hotel at 8am and went to Mall of America.  Oh god!  I feel sick, have no money, and am stuck in Mall of America for 5 hours!  Then the bus ride back home.  I'm glad my job with that program is now over and I won't be working for them next summer.  My next rant may be best understood by reading the article at this link first:  urlLink http://www.lufkindailynews.com/news/newsfd/auto/feed/news/2004/08/01/1091333650.18121.3890.4836.html?urac=n&amp;urvf=10917320947500.020138782400256017   I'm all about people expressing their mopinions - it's their right in this country and I would be the last person to take their right away, even if I don't agree with them.  But the guy in this article was crossing the line and harrassing this  woman who works at an abortion clinic.  I would have tried to get a restraining order.  He followed her around town, for christ's sake!  I call that stalking!   Anyway, I guess that's about it.  I'm glad I don't have to work until Monday again.  It'll be nice to relax for awhile.  -Marquette

      Had a HUGE dinner tonight.  Unfortunately, because I was cooking and baking all day, the apartment became sweltering hot.  Went swimming - Lake Superior wasn't cold for the first time that I've been in it this summer.  Was in the water for over an hour, swam out to some rocks and hung out for awhile.  Watched a movie, and am putting off packing my shit for the trip to Minnesota tomorrow.  I'm not looking forward to going.  I'll be on a bus for hours with 30 high school kids and a handful of adults that I don't really know that well.  I'll be bringing a disc man and a shit load of CDs and some books.  I'd prefer to keep to myself for as long as possible.   -Marquette
