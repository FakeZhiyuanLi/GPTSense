      My most intimate thoughts are of the death of both my parents. They died twenty three years apart. My mother died at age 52, my father 78. When they died, I lived thousands of miles away. I did not attend my mother's funeral. I attended my father's but the memories of their sickness and pain are equally haunting. My mother died of very painful bone cancer. From what my father told it while he was being treated of lymphoma, her pain was excruciating. He had to bring her from Hualien to Taipei, a three to four hours rough ride on the sea. There was no stretcher to carry her off the boat. Men grabbed her arms, picked her up, walked her down the deck to the street. They loaded her up into a taxi and that's how she arrived in the hospital. The doctors could not help her and they offered her morphine. Lots of morphine. My father brought her home and she lay in bed, in and out of consciousness. That's when I visited her after nine years living abroad. She cried whenever she was awake. Most of the times she did not recognize me or her eighteen months old grand daughter. When she drifted out of morphine, she would call the doctors liars. They all lied because she didn't have cancer, and she would get better. She clung to the hope of cure. She didn't want to die. I left her in the dying bed and came home to care for my other child. I called home often and one time I got to speak with her. She was clear minded and she said she did not remember I visited with her for a month. In August, my father called to say she had passed away. Thirty-some years later today I still dream of her living and speaking to me on the phone. In my dream, she is cured and well. She is waiting for me to visit her in Hualian again. My father died a very sorrowful man. His pain was mostly loneliness and anger. For years he was seeing a psychiatrist at the local hospital treating depression. I didn't know. I only thought he was getting sleeping pills. When he was diagnosed with lymphoma, he checked himself into a Christian nursing home. I visited him there, the living condition was horrible. A large quarter filled with patiens. My father called the patients garbage because they were the abandoned and forgotten people. After successful chemotherapy, he got better and moved back to his townhouse. He fixed the place up. He imported a young woman from Indonesia to live with him and care for him. His grand daughter visited him. My brother, sister and I took turns through out the year and flew thousands of miles to visit him. When I stayed with him in his townhouse, I actually felt good that he was well cared for. But things took a bad turn. He lost the Indonesian woman. Since he could not live alone, he tried to move in with his youngest son in Taitung, that didn't work out. He moved back to his townhouse and had a fall. From the fall he caught pnumonia. His brother checked him into the hospital in the intensive care. We all flew home again and visited him there. He was conscious sometimes and he ackowledged our presence. Then we all left him behind and returned to our jobs. From our uncle and aunt, we knew he moved out of intensive care for a while and got angry from time to time. He didn't want to live. When he died, we went home to bury him. Two sons and two daughters. But he lived his last days alone and lonely, feeling not lovely by anyone. This is why I think I feel haunted. I was not there when they took their last breath. And I could not help them feel better in dealing with death. I know I will be different when the time comes. I trust God that I will have a place to go. I want my children to know that I've lived a good life. And I am grateful that God gave them to me and make us a family.
