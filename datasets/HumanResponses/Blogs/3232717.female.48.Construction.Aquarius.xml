      THIS IS MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT BLOGGING I am using this blog as therapy.  Why do I need therapy - I don't really know.  Doesn't everyone?   Anyway, I am going to use this as my true thoughts page - no holds barred.   I am bothered by a lot of petty things today.  Seems a shame to be bothered by petty things.  Everyone has been through enought "big" things to know that petty things aren't worth being bothered by.  Knowing that, I am still bothered by the petty things.  What is the best formula for getting rid of petty bothers?  What is the formula?  A friend just suggest I "fix" my attitude by being nice to other ppl.  BUT but, I just want to be nice to myself today......

      Right now I am not sure why I started this blog since I think about posting a new one and don't. I woke up tired this morning because Rick was awake during the night and therefore woke me up.  I hate waking up tired.  As a result, I think, I had this eerie (sp?) numb feeling for awhile today.   I am setting my son, Dave, up this weekend with a young woman I know.  THAT ought to be interesting.  I have never done that before with any of my sons. Hopefully Allie will be getting a job soon as I need her to repay me for her tuition costs. Got the new camper yesterday and am frustrated now because we can't go camping.  Working this weekend, next weekend is Memorial Day and the campgrouds are too busy, next weekend is a party I want to attend and the next weekend Chad is taking the camper.  Might just go camping with him.  Sheesh! Have to brag about Gussy, my puppy.  Most mornings he is jumping all around when he sees I am ready for work.  He thinks I am going to take him along or go for a walk or something.  It's hard for me to get out the door because of it and the fact that I am always carrying stuff.  Here's the usual routine: he sleeps on the bed until he sees I am ready to go, then he jumps around, follows me out into the garage,  I put my stuff in the car, pick him up and get him into the house shutting the door quickly so he won't get out.  This morning, he remained on the bed, I went and put my stuff in the car, he came into his room and laid down in his bed, I bent down and kissed him for being such a good puppy.  The reality of the situation is probably that he has given up on me taking him with or for a walk and has resigned himself to napping instead.  He so obviously likes Rick more then me. Rick spoils him.  Rick is a spoiler.

      Okay, so I didn't mean to stick such a big pic of myself up there and COULD go back and redo but don't have the energy right now.  I was standing in front a beautiful lake in Colorado in that pic. I have been reading someone's blog for almost a year: http://www.thestudyofdesign.com/NC/ and that is how I got started doing this.  She (Beth) has a lot a ppl who read her blog unlike me who has no one. Which is ok - this is therapy?

      Lately, I have really been feeling like I need a vacation.  In the last few months I have: started working a part-time job, got fired in April, worked a few days at another part-time job, been busy at my full time job, been busy at home because it's Spring, had fights with 3 of my kids, had financial problems, and had tension in my family over my mom's possessions in other words - NEED A VACATION! I just need to go and refresh my mind and body for a few days.  Only have 10 hours of vacation built up at work (which is another sore point - that I have to 'build up' vacation and not just get it).  Right now I would be happy with a vacation that consisted of a really good book, a sunny spot to lay down and read it and lots of peace, quiet and naps.  I don't see it happening any time soon though.  Kids are coming home from college this weekend and working part-time job on Saturday. Sunday have to have the "family meeting" with my brothers and sister.  Hope that doesn't turn into a disaster! On a happier note, I am proud of my two youngest kids - they rocked in college this year.  Both above a 3 point. Way to go Dave and Allie! :)   Rick and I bought a used camper yesterday so maybe a vacation is on the horizon? If you are in the Omaha, NE area, go to see the band Monkey's Uncle - they rock too.

      I am reading a really good book.  It's "Killer Angels" by Michael Sharrar.  It is the book from which the movie "Gettysburg" was made.  I am facinated by the Civil War period in our nations history.  It was such a crucial time - if the war would have ended another way what a hugely different country I would be living in now.  I have been really busy at work this week - which is good, makes the days go by much faster.  I work at a construction estimating office.  We get plans from an architect and put together a price for the building they have designed.  I like my job and my boss's are great to work for, it's just that sometimes it gets slow and I don't have enough to do. It's 72 degrees right now!  Hallelujah! Spring has sprung.  I am going to plant impatiens and tomatoes tonight.  I love digging in the dirt.  It's from growing up on a farm. I have dreamt of my ex husband for the past three nights.  I guess it's because it will be the anniversary of his death on May 10.  I think I am over all that and then my darn subconscious mind steps in and send me dreams of him.
