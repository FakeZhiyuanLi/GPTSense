      I started this blog on a whim.&nbsp; I hope I don't end it with a whimper.&nbsp;   Have you ever looked at your life and wonder when and where you completely lost control of it?&nbsp; I think mine has had a leak - like a little hole in a dam.&nbsp; Every moment, when I decide once again to give a little of my power away, drip...drip...drip.  It's the small things, really.&nbsp; A momentary lack of energy to enforce boundaries, and lapse of control when demands are placed on me, and before I know it, my life is living me.&nbsp; I'm not living it anymore.&nbsp; I run from commitment to commitment - where did the time go?&nbsp;   And it even invades my leisure time - instead of mindfully and purposefully choosing what I will do that I really like to do, I find myself losing time in endless loops of Internet browsing, computer solitaire, and more naps than I really need to take.  Does anyone know what I mean?

      Well, it's almost 4 AM now, and I stayed up late to pay bills.  With the turmoil surrounding my parents' illnesses (we moved Mom to an Alzheimer's unit on June 15th, and Dad is in the hospital with major heart and kidney problems), I have been sadly neglecting my own personal affairs for several weeks.  It didn't help that the company I worked for went out of business a year ago, and we are running out of money and credit.  It's hard to pay bills when you just don't have the money.  Fortunately for us, things are looking up in that department.  I have taken on some new clients, with lots of work for me to do.  I'm a CPA, and I specialize in helping small businesses with their bookkeeping, payroll, and tax issues.  I'm not a "tax whiz" really, but I do like to fix things and straighten out other people's messes.  My own, however.....  Well, the point is that I stayed up late expressly to pay my bills.  I haven't balanced the checkbook in a month of Sundays, and the credit cards are likewise unchecked.  It really goes against my grain to pay bills without reconciling my accounts first.  The problem is, it's a really big job, and I don't really want to do it!!!  (I suppose...I don't know what else would be keeping me from it)  So, I returned from my Girl Scout service unit meeting, all prepared to do battle with my financial and organizational demons.   Fired up!  Ready!!  Psyched!!!  Did I tackle that big, ugly, overgrown dragon?  (hollow laugh).  No, I tackled the baby dragon that isn't really even a problem yet.  I spent several hours (yep - HOURS) preparing a calendar for the coming year for my Girl Scout troop.  I grant you that it needed to be done.  I'll even grant you that I was the one to do it.  But, aside from a quickie schedule of August and September, it did NOT have to be done in the detail I did it!!!  I know I'll be glad I got it all down on paper, and I feel ever so organized now.  As long as I don't look at my bills.  OR my checkbook.  OR my credit card statements.  As long as I dodge all calls from creditors, and laugh off my phone being cut off....  Ah, well.  Here I go - I'm already exhausted.  I may as well take a stab at it.  Ready,  fire, aim.
