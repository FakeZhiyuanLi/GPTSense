      I read  urlLink this  great article:    Tony Campolo, tells about a friend of his who made a career change. He says, "Some years ago, a friend of mine went to teach English literature at a state college. He was there for three weeks when he went into the dean's office to say that he was quitting.  "I'm not coming back next week, and I thought you ought to know," he said. The dean replied, "If you walk out on your contract, you're not going to teach here again. What's more, you won't teach anywhere, if I can help it."  Campolo goes on with the story, saying: After my friend left his job, his mother contacted me by phone and said I had to see him. She was sure he had gone crazy and hoped I could talk him into going back to his job.  I found my friend Charlie living in an attic apartment in Hamilton Square, New Jersey. I must admit that his apartment had a certain style: travel posters all over the walls, a good assortment ofbooks scattered around the room, and the stereo playing a Wagnerian opera. I sat down in a beanbag chair that swallowed me up. After we exchanged niceties, I came to the point.  'What have you done?" I asked.  "I quit," said Charlie. "I walked out. I don't want to teach anymore. Every time I walked into that classroom, I died a little bit."  Campolo says: I could understand him. I'm a teacher, and I know what it's like to go into a class and pour out your heart to students, to let every nerve inside you tingle with the excitement ofyour most profound insights. I know what it's like to passionately share the struggles of your existence, to lay your soul bare in an attempt to communicate your deepest feelings. Then, when it's all over, some student in the back ofthe room raises his hand and says, "Do we have to know this stuff for the final?" (We have some teachers here who know that feeling! I'm sure Jesus must have experienced that plenty when He was teaching!)  Anyway, Campolo goes on, saying: It wasn't long before I realized that Charlie was not about to go back into the classroom, so I asked him what he was doing with himself these days. He said, "l'm a mailman."  Reaching back into the value system provided by the Protestant work ethic, I said to him, "Charlie, if you're going to be a mailman, be the best mailman in the world!"  He said, "But I'm a lonely mailman. Everybody else who delivers mail gets back to the post office by about two o'clock. I never get back until six."  "What takes you so long?"  "I visit," said Charlie. "You'd never believe how many lonely people there are on my route who had never been visited until I became a mailman. What's more, now I can't sleep at night."  "Why can't you sleep at night?"  Charlie cried, "Have you ever tried to sleep after drinking fifteen cups of coffee?"  Campolo says: As I sat and looked at my friend Charlie, I envied him. He was alive with the excitement that comes to a person doing something meaningful with his life. Because he moved from being a college professor to being a mailman, he has lost status. But what difference does that make? As Charlie invests himself significantly in the lives of other people, his is finding fulfillment in, as Scripture says in James 1:27, 'visiting orphans and widows in their distress."  Is he a role ? Let’s be honest… no way. Ya like all our mom’s are telling their kids – you know, you should quit school and become a mailman… no way, it’s a great story but we want our kids to emulate rich successful people. Every mom wants their kid to be a doctor right?  Here’s a question no one ever asks… why? Why the heck do they want their kid to be a doctor… to help people? That’s the standard answer but its crap.      I think this really comes in line with my feelings that we've all got to live our lives to the max or else we slowly die inside... Sometimes I think i sound a bit like a broken record because, in my cell, i'm always telling the guys to "dream big, and don't stop."  The truth is, I can't stop encouraging them to dream and  live their dreams ... man I wish I couldn't get to sleep at night because i've spent so much time loving people...

      it's  urlLink snowing  so much in Toronto, i just think things might come to an end.    All this snow reminds me of some Norse Mythology; for them, the end of the world comes as a huge wolf gobbles up the sun and then everything gets quiet as a blanket of snow covers the whole world.    Not sure if that's this afternoon but we just might be close...

      May the power of your love, O Lord, fiery and sweet as honey, wean my heart from all that is under heaven, so that I may die for love of your love, you who were so good as to die for love of my love.     Sir Francis of Assisi

      reading  urlLink jordocooper.com  today and he posted the following by Reggie McNeal:  "Fallout is not limited to the clergy... The faithful.. wonder when they are going to experience the changed life they've been promised and expected to experience at church. In North America, these people have been led to believe that their Christian life is all about the church, so this failure of the church not only creates doubt about the church, it also leads them to all kinds of doubt about God and their relationship with Him.  "Many congregations and leaders.. adopt a refuge mentality. This is the perspective that withdraws from the culture, builds the walls thicker and higher, hunkers down to wait for the storm to blow over. Those with a refuge mentality view the world outside the church as the enemy [and] live within the bubble of Christian subculture.. Refuge churches evidence enormous self-preoccupation. They deceive themselves into believing they are a potent force.   "The point is.. all the effort to fix the church misses the point. You can build the perfect church--and they still won't come. People are not looking for a great church... The age in which institutional religion holds appeal is passing away. Church leaders seem unable to grasp this simple implication of the new world--people outside the church think church is for church people, not for them."   I think that's why it's so important to have smaller scale relationship... especially in the context of having large scale church.  Without small-scale relationship building, there's no life and we're all just refugees.  But when you have a home in the context of a large community, you can learn, grow, and contribute.

      Was reading  urlLink Kerismith's Blog  this morning and she has this beautiful post about just seeing the beauty in everything:   Last night I stopped in front of the local corner store. In the window I saw the owner talking to a customer. The customer was taking clementines out of a box and squeezing them, then putting them into another box. I saw the owner take a clementine, peel it open and then offer a piece to the woman. I could not hear anything of what was being said. It was like a scene from a movie, the way the light was, the colours, the snow, the quiet, and I had a front row seat. The act of peeling an orange for another person seemed so intimate and beautiful. And, yet I know in reality it may not have been, (was she complaining?) But something about the whole image summed up something so simple, an everyday task, an interaction with another human being. I watched as the woman left the store with a box of clementines and bag of Tender Vittles.    I love how she just puts the mystery in the everyday.  God spoke to me a whole bunch about this kind of stuff last year.  My fruit of the spirit that i was working on was gentleness and a large part of my learning came from enjoying life.  "Stop and smell the roses" and "take your time" were two important phrases last year.  Plus He really spoke to me through a chapter in  urlLink The Ragamuffin Gospel  where Brennan Manning talks about wonder.  I want to walk in wonder every day... drinking in the His beauty everywhere and in everything I do.   I think that's kind of why I love watching the stars (when i get out of the city) because there's nothing i need to do; I can just take it all in.    This all reminds me of this quote by  urlLink David Crowder :    You know in romantic comedies when the lead and their love interest are in the scene where they are at a dinner party with tons of other guests and conversation is going on all around them, some of which they are even involved in, for they are the leading couple, but then there is that moment. You know, the moment where the couple’s eyes lock. They communicate without any words spoken. Things no one else is aware of. They are still present with everyone else but they have checked out for a bit. This individual, romantic experience is had and no one else has any clue.   There is something similar that happens in the corporate worship experience that is truly amazing and transcending. I mean we know that our convening with God is not confined to any specific moment of any specific day, so what makes, say, a Sunday morning any more special than a Tuesday in the middle of traffic on our drive home? Is God less present on Tuesday? No. Yet, there is something so different and other than when we are in a room full of people that have gathered in the name of Christ.   But the thing that really sends my head spinning is that we can be in the middle of this corporate experience and feel like we have the sole attention of God. In the middle of a crowd, it’s just the two of us in this beautiful exchange. And these other individual’s voices who believe, no less than I, to have his total attention start to blend with mine. It doesn’t lessen my individual experience it only deepens and heightens the romance somehow. All of these individual voices blending to one.   not sure if this is a really connected entry, but it's my thoughts today and i like where they're headed  ;)

       urlLink Amazon.com: Books: Church in Emerging Culture: Five Perspectives   I want this book.   I'm reading some of  urlLink Jordon Cooper's  thoughts on the book and I've decided that I really want it.   Leonard Sweet's always got something challenging to say; I'm really thinking about all this Emergent Church stuff lately.  BUt there's a whole bunch of problems associated with growth (even though it's the most natural thing in the whole universe)...  Like when we leave behind old wine skins, how do we move into new ones?  Do we have to establish them?  Do they establish themselves?   Ok, i'm getting into my own circular argument...

       urlLink What Christian Theologian Are You?         "Sin is incurable by the strength of man, nor does free will have any validity here,  so that even the saints say: 'The evil which I do not wish, this I do.' 'You are not doing the  things which you wish.' 'Since my loins are filled with illusions,' etc."         You are Martin Luther!   Yeah, you have a way of letting everyone know how you  feel, usually with Bible quotes attached, and will think your way through the issues, although  sometimes you make no sense! You aren't always sure of yourself, and you can change your mind about  things, something you actually consider a strength. You can take solitude, especially with some music.        i think that's a pretty good description of me, even with the scripture in your face stuff... LOL

      just read this:   urlLink Going Canuck  "I need something to shake me from a recent nightmare. I was an actor on a movie shoot, in a bright white, mirrored shopping mall. There was a shootout, I thought it was part of the movie, but it was real, and I was shot. I died and went to hell. After a dark and bumpy ride down, down, down a dark red shaft in a rusty, wrought-iron elevator, I crash landed in a sunny suburb somewhere. No birds, no music, no sounds, and no people, just a gentle summer breeze. I went from house to house looking for someone, anyone. All I found were unfinished blueprints, unused airplane tickets, crumpled up music scores, and half-painted canvases. Dreams that'd never come true, for an eternity. Half-formed projects that'd never be completed. Creative yearnings that would never be satiated, ever. That was my hell. Sartre would be proud. 'Are these the shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of things that May be, only?' It ain't fire and brimstone, but it scared the crap outta me."  it's funny how real it really is;  and i like how he saw it: no hope

       urlLink The Danger of Grace Without Truth by Andy Comiskey   ok, just read this article, that Jan (from work) sent me...  it's interesting.    I have a few thoughts.  He just dives into his response without giving us much of an idea of Manning’s thoughts.  I like what he says about “cheap grace;” I’m not entirely sure what to think about situations like this.  I mean, Comiskey’s come out of the garbage and death that he’s talking about, so I’m sure he’s got the authority to say some of the things he’s saying.  On the other hand, I think sometimes the “church” tries to run from cheap grace and ends up running away from grace completely.    I think I’m a Manning advocate (well at least an advocate of his writings.)  I really like what Manning says in his books; I’ve never heard him condone any sort of sinful lifestyle… but more than encouraging us to get beyond our sin, his main message is to get in love with God.  I think the deeper you get into God, the more he’s lead you out of a sinful lifestyle.  God’s really big and I know he wants us to be free and pure more than any religious teacher, right?  He’s the one who does all the work in our hearts.    It’s interesting to hear how Manning feels about same sex relationships; I’ve heard Tony Campolo say similar stuff.  Although I would say that grace and love are our only roles with people who struggle with this stuff (well, who struggle with anything) I also think we can’t condone the sin.    I wish there was an easy answer for this, but there really isn’t.  It’s good; this has got me thinking…

      i found this really good opinion article on  urlLink theheresey.com :    My Postmodernity?  I think (Postmodernity) really has a lot to do with losing faith in society and its values because society has failed so many. When one loses faith in so many things it isn’t much of a stretch to lose faith in everything. For me growing up in a home with one parent introduced me to injustice. I hated divorce with a passion and I didn’t think it was fair. As I grew up I began to see that there were great many of our social institutions that didn’t live up to their billing.  When I became a Christian it wasn’t because I shopped around for religions and picked the one that suited me the best. I read the bible and God revealed Himself to me. It became clear to me that there was truth and that it could be found. Later on I realized that this truth is not found in many of the ways people seek it. When I started going to church it became readily apparent that only some of the people experienced what I had. Most of them knew Christ as a bunch of words on a page or a tradition to hold.  I am "postmodern" in so much that I believe that modernity oversimplified the search for truth. It is inherently arrogant by assuming people observe things impartially. The moral decay in society isn’t the result of postmodernity. It is the result of modernity which detached people from the real source life change. Postmodernity is just modernity caving in on itself. The natural end to a flawed approach to truth.   I don’t believe the church's best option is to abandon truth, discernment, or theology. I think the church's best option is to have integrity. People are looking for truth. Truth in more than just words, but in deed and life. It may offend them, but that is how the gospel works. By catering to a pick and choose culture we send an unspoken message. That message is "we really don’t know what we are doing" or "we really don’t know any better than anyone else." If that is indeed the case then why do we bother?   I agree.  “What is truth” really isn’t the question anymore.  I guess the issue is how do we stir hunger in people to keep on searching?

      wow, back from the encounter ...am tired but so happy  and wow, i don't know why i'm so surprised when He just does amazing and wonderful things on encounters... but again, i am. i watched him break down barriers, bring hope, and release deep peace...  Kenny and Gary (in my cell) spoke -- and they did an awesome job (i am so proud) i'm so thankfull that He has done so much   Romans 6: 4 - 11   When we are lowered into the water, it is like the burial of Jesus; when we are raised up out of the water, it is like the resurrection of Jesus. 5 Each of us is raised into a light-filled world by our Father so that we can see where we're going in our new grace-sovereign country. 6 Could it be any clearer? Our old way of life was nailed to the Cross with Christ, a decisive end to that sin-miserable life - no longer at sin's every beck and call! What we believe is this: 7  8 If we get included in Christ's sin-conquering death, we also get included in his life-saving resurrection. 9 We know that when Jesus was raised from the dead it was a signal of the end of death-as-the-end. Never again will death have the last word. 10 When Jesus died, he took sin down with him, but alive he brings God down to us. 11 From now on, think of it this way: Sin speaks a dead language that means nothing to you; God speaks your mother tongue, and you hang on every word. You are dead to sin and alive to God. That's what Jesus did.    thank you papa

      trying to come to grips with what today symbolizes. Now i am not part of a following that overtly practices Lent, but I've been feeling all day like I need to give its significance some thought.  So i went to some blogs that have given me some food for thought in the past.   Result: nothing of value.    urlLink Definition...   urlLink Warren Kinsella's got a small entry about his kids.   urlLink Antiseptic and a bit insipid thoughts by Alan McCormack on Lent.   urlLink Quote  by Patricia St. John from "The Alchemist": ...stooping very low, He engraves with care His Name, indelible, upon our dust,  And, from the ashes of our self-despair, Kindles a flame of hope and humble trust. He seeks no second site on which to build,  But on the old foundation, stone by stone, Cementing sad experience with grace,  Fashions a stronger temple of His own. I'm not really sure if anyone's thoughts so far do it for me.  I re-read T.S. Elliot's  urlLink Ash Wednesday  and it made me think a bit about how life is full and free and beautiful... but there will be one day when i will cease to draw air into my lungs.  I will die and my Father saw to it that there would be more for me than death.   I've been praying all day for some understanding about this.  I think I found some when  urlLink Alan Creech  led me to think about  urlLink Psalm 51 : 10 Create in me a clean heart, O God. Renew a right spirit within me. 11 Do not banish me from your presence, and don't take your Holy Spirit from me. 12 Restore to me again the joy of your salvation, and make me willing to obey you. 13 Then I will teach your ways to sinners, and they will return to you.

      was reading  urlLink McSpotlight  and found some terrible excerpts from  urlLink Fast Food Nation : ...the taste of McDonald's French fries, for example, has long been praised by customers, competitors and even food critics. James Beard, the legendary American gourmet, loved McDonald's fries. Their distinctive taste does not stem from the type of potatoes that McDonald's buys, the technology that processes them, or the restaurant equipment that fries them.  Other chains buy their French fries from the same large processing companies, use Russet Burbanks and have similar fryers in their restaurant kitchens. The taste of a fast-food fry is largely determined by the cooking oil. For decades, McDonald's cooked its French fries in a mixture of about 7% cottonseed oil and 93% beef tallow. The mix gave the fries their unique flavour - and more saturated beef fat per ounce than a McDonald's hamburger.  Amid a barrage of criticism over the amount of cholesterol in its fries, McDonald's switched to pure vegetable oil in 1990. The switch presented the company with an enormous challenge: how to make fries that subtly taste like beef without cooking them in tallow. A look at the ingredients now used in the preparation of McDonald's French fries suggests how the problem was solved. At the end of the list is a seemingly innocuous yet oddly mysterious phrase: "natural flavour". That ingredient helps to explain not only why the fries taste so good, but also why most fast food - indeed, most of the food Americans eat today - tastes the way it does.  The McDonald's Corporation will not reveal the exact origin of the natural flavour added to its French fries. In response to enquiries from Vegetarian Journal, however, McDonald's did acknowledge that its fries derive some of their characteristic flavour from "animal products."  Other popular fast foods derive their flavour from unexpected sources. Wendy's grilled chicken sandwich, for example, contains beef extracts.   A typical artificial strawberry flavour, such as that found in a Burger King strawberry milk shake, contains the following ingredients: amyl acetate, amyl butyrate, amyl valerate, anethol, anisyl formate, benzyl acetate, benzyl isobutyrate, butyric acid, cinnamyl isobutyrate, cinnamyl valerate, cognac essential oil, diacetyl, dipropyl ketone, ethyl acetate, ethyl amyl ketone, ethyl butyrate, ethyl cinnamate, ethyl heptanoate, ethyl heptylate, ethlyl lactate, ethyl methylphenylglycidate, ethyl nitrate, ethyl propionate, ethyl valerate, heliotropin, hydroxyphenyl-2-butonone (10% solution in alcohol), a-ionone, isobutyl anthranilate, isobutyl butyrate, lemon essential oil, maltol, 4-methylactophenone, methyl anthranilate, methyl benzoate, methyl cinnamate, methyl heptine carbonate, methyl naphthyl ketone, methyl salicylate, mint essential oil, neroli essential oil, nerolin, neryl isobutyrate, orris butter, phenethyl alcohol, rose, rum ether, g-undecalactone, vanillin and solvent.  The new enzyme-based processes are responsible for extremely lifelike dairy flavours. One company now offers not just butter flavour, but also fresh creamy butter, cheesy butter, milky butter, savoury melted butter and super-concentrated butter flavour, in liquid or powder form. The development of new fermentation techniques, as well as new techniques for heating mixtures of sugar and amino acids, have led to the creation of much more realistic meat flavours.   Cochineal extract (also known as carmine or carminic acid) is made from the desiccated bodies of female Dactylopius coccus Costa, a small insect harvested mainly in Peru and the Canary Islands. The bug feeds on red cactus beries, and colour from the berries accumulates in the females and their unhatched larvae. The insects are collected, dried, and ground into a pigment. It takes about 70,000 of them to produce a pound of carmine, which is used to make processed foods look pink, red, or purple. Some strawberry yoghurt gets its colour from carmine, and so do many frozen fruit bars, sweets and fruit fillings, and Ocean Spray pink-grapefruit juice drink.  ...shudder...

      so I went to a  gigantic  wedding Saturday night and it was completely not what I expected.  I have a gigantic family (hence the wedding size).  To give you an idea, each of my four grandparents come from families of at least  10  children.  Now each of my great aunts and uncles each had at least 5 children (my mom and dad's generation) and each of them had at least 2 or 3 children (my generation)...   the wedding was from my maternal grandmother's side (we had over 250 people just from our side of the family).    these things are usually pretty sketchy to begin with: lots of people trying to impress each other, tons of rich Italians, and at least one major fight.  This wedding had all that fun stuff but it's never all bad; a ton of good food and wine, plus some of my crazy uncles and cousins giving speeches and dancing... it was pretty good overall.   The thing that really amazed me was this ceremony that Greeks perfom; the father of the groom, the groom himself and my cousin (the beautful bride) link arms and begin to do this side-stepping dance to some slow Greek music.  Then, one by one, about 150 family members (from his side) came up to them, pinned some cash to their clothes, spoke a blessing over them and joined the chain.  By the end (about 30 mins later) there was this long chain that had coiled around itself a few times.   I watched all this completely amazed.  It was such a beautiful thing to see this public honouring as family members said (with their words and their wallet) "we believe in you, we bless you; grow, love, and build together."  The whole ceremony was very intentional but also very innocent.   In some ways, i think my heart longs for some of that in the church.  The truth is, although the ceremony is ancient tradition, it was real and purposefull for the people involved.  So many of my friends are practicing religious tradition that has no life; sometimes I wish they'd either overthrow that tradition (which isn't every easy in the church) or embrace the value in those traditions.    at any rate, I wouldn't mid marrying a Greek girl Father... ;)

      From  urlLink The NIV Application Commentary  - Genesis (p.189):  1. We must be willing to preserve a godly perspective on the issue and accord Christian respect to those we disagree with, refusing to belittle, degrade, accuse, or insult them. Ad hominem arguments and other varieties of "negative campaigning" should be set aside.   2. We must not allow our differences of opinion to overshadow and disrupt the effectiveness of ministry and our Christian witness.  3. We must decry the arrogance that accompanies a feeling of self-righteousness and portrays others as somehow less godly because of the position they hold. Man, I'm so bad at doing this the correct and loving way sometimes...  Thank God for friends who are full of grace (and sometimes as stubborn as I am).  via  urlLink Dashhouse .

      been finding a whole bunch around the net lately... Even in the best of health we should have death always before our eyes so that we will not expect to remain on this earth forever, but will have one foot in the air, so to speak...    When I preach I regard neither doctors nor magistrates, of whom I have above forty in my congregation; I have all my eyes on the servant maids and on the children. And if the learned men are not well pleased with what they hear, well, the door is open.    Faith is a living, daring confidence in God's grace, so sure and certain that a man could stake his life on it a thousand times.   To gather with God's people in united adoration of the Father is as necessary to the Christian life as prayer.   Who loves not women, wine and song remains a fool his whole life long.   You should not believe your conscience and your feelings more than the word which the Lord who receives sinners preaches to you.  And Martin Luther King Jr. said, If a man hasn’t discovered something that he will die for, he isn’t fit to live.

      Well here it is,  the top ten list of things going on inside of me this past Valentines weekend:   1) decided to get back in shape (my Christmas pudge hasn't left yet) 2) thought i had kicked performance out of my life, but after Friday night, i'm not so sure any more because i wanted to die after worship 3) longing for outdoor space as I'm trying to read  urlLink Celebration of Discipline  and I really want to learn how to meditate from a Christian perspective 4) had a good time with Gary on Saturday at  urlLink Ikea .  We actually sat down in their  urlLink café  and had a coffee... there were couches and everything.  It was good to catch up... i'm so honoured to have him in my cell.   5)  urlLink John 14:27  Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.  ... been thinking about Kate's message to our cell last Thursday.  She said some really good stuff about how God's peace means wholeness and fullness and rest.   6) kinda feeling alienated from friends but i think that's a good thing right now  because  somethings going on in my heart and it hurts ... it's really pushing me towards Him though 7) my sister and I have had some communication problems lately which majorly sucks; she's on reading week, so i'm hoping the rest for her will mean peace for us 8) spoke on Sunday morning and surprised myself at how much of the word is really hidden in my heart; Holy Spirit brought a whole bunch right back as I spoke on growing as a leader and being committed to the process of growing (yes, I see the irony) 9) dynamics in my cell are weird right now; i'm praying for balance 10) I really love God more than my life; i think the good thing about going through rough stuff in life is that it renews my perspective.  There is nothing else that satisfys or fills me.  There will never be anyone who could take His place.  Living for him and with him is the only way i want to live...  But I really needed to read this quote: The whole difference between construction and creation is exactly this: that a thing constructed can only be loved after it is constructed; but a thing created is loved before it exists. -- G. K. Chesterton created in love and for love...

       Chocolate is a number one Valentine's gift, but it's heartbreaking for most cocoa producers and their families. Cocoa farms are home to widespread child labor and even child slavery, especially in West Africa where most cocoa comes from. The U.S. chocolate industry has developed a plan of action but it still keeps producers too poor to cover labor or basic needs. The real solution is fair trade, which gives cocoa farmers the minimum price they need to send their kids to school, pay their workers, and live with dignity.  urlLink M&Ms  Mars, the world's biggest chocolate company, has refused to sell Fair Trade Certified chocolate despite an outcry from chocolate lovers of all ages.  Apparently it's a  urlLink really big issue .  I didn't even realize that there  was  fair trade chocolate.    There's a lot of good information at the  urlLink Make Trade Fair  website... It's not just for guys in Coldplay or Kenny... buying fair trade coffee, cereals, and now chocolate is easy and the products are available everywhere.    BTW, I hope  urlLink Cadbury's  (in the UK) uses fair trade cocoa... because i like their chocolate a lot...

      The above title referrs to a few things... Anyway, it's everyone's favourite deadly bacteria...  urlLink Ecoli!   the picture is quite beautiful, even though  urlLink 61 people die in the US  as a direct result of E. coli infection and complications.   urlLink Health Canada  doesn't have anything specific on Ecoli.   I'm not sure why things that look beautiful can hurt you so bad.  At times I look at the universe and I'm like, that doesn't make sense.  Doesn't every kid wonder: why should the stove look so cool when it's on and yet burn me when i touch it?    Oh, I don't understand.   Linda Cho was saying that it's interesting how there are 31 days in (most) months and Proverbs has 31 chapters.    urlLink Proverbs 12:  1 If you love learning, you love the discipline that goes with it - how shortsighted to refuse correction! 2 A good person basks in the delight of God, and he wants nothing to do with devious schemers. 3 You can't find firm footing in a swamp, but life rooted in God stands firm. 4 A hearty wife invigorates her husband, but a frigid woman is cancer in the bones. 5 The thinking of principled people makes for justice; the plots of degenerates corrupt. 6 The words of the wicked kill; the speech of the upright saves. 7 Wicked people fall to pieces - there's nothing to them; the homes of good people hold together.  8 A person who talks sense is honored; airheads are held in contempt. 9 Better to be ordinary and work for a living than act important and starve in the process. 10 Good people are good to their animals; the "good-hearted" bad people kick and abuse them. 11 The one who stays on the job has food on the table; the witless chase whims and fancies. 12 What the wicked construct finally falls into ruin, while the roots of the righteous give life, and more life. Wise People Take Advice 13 The gossip of bad people gets them in trouble; the conversation of good people keeps them out of it. 14 Well-spoken words bring satisfaction; well-done work has its own reward. 15 Fools are headstrong and do what they like; wise people take advice. 16 Fools have short fuses and explode all too quickly; the prudent quietly shrug off insults. 17 Truthful witness by a good person clears the air, but liars lay down a smoke screen of deceit. 18 Rash language cuts and maims, but there is healing in the words of the wise. 19 Truth lasts; lies are here today, gone tomorrow.  20 Evil scheming distorts the schemer; peace-planning brings joy to the planner. 21 No evil can overwhelm a good person, but the wicked have their hands full of it. 22 God can't stomach liars; he loves the company of those who keep their word. 23 Prudent people don't flaunt their knowledge; talkative fools broadcast their silliness. 24 The diligent find freedom in their work; the lazy are oppressed by work. 25 Worry weighs us down; a cheerful word picks us up. 26 A good person survives misfortune, but a wicked life invites disaster. 27 A lazy life is an empty life, but "early to rise" gets the job done. 28 Good men and women travel right into life; sin's detours take you straight to hell.  I guess there's no sense in living in fear.  I want to learn the lessons God's got for me... even when they're difficult.  I won't stop growing and I won't stop loving, even though it hurts.    Oh well, here's a  urlLink cool pic of salmonella .

      Had an amazing cell tonight with my guys.    I led a short talk on  purity  that was based on  urlLink Galatians 2:20  "I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.   It's amazing how much power there is when we realize that we're all dead meat.  I read most of the chapter from The Message and it provided so much insight for discussion.  I especially liked  urlLink  verses 15 to 21: 15 We Jews know that we have no advantage of birth over "non-Jewish sinners." 16 We know very well that we are not set right with God by rule-keeping but only through personal faith in Jesus Christ. How do we know? We tried it - and we had the best system of rules the world has ever seen! Convinced that  no human being can please God by self-improvement,  we believed in Jesus as the Messiah so that we might be set right before God by trusting in the Messiah, not by trying to be good.  17 Have some of you noticed that we are not yet perfect? (No great surprise, right?) And are you ready to make the accusation that since people like me, who go through Christ in order to get things right with God, aren't perfectly virtuous, Christ must therefore be an accessory to sin? The accusation is frivolous. 18 If I was "trying to be good," I would be rebuilding the same old barn that I tore down. I would be acting as a charlatan. 19 What actually took place is this: I tried keeping rules and working my head off to please God, and it didn't work. So I quit being a "law man" so that I could be God's man.  20 Christ's life showed me how, and enabled me to do it. I identified myself completely with him. Indeed, I have been crucified with Christ. My ego is no longer central. It is no longer important that I appear righteous before you or have your good opinion, and  I am no longer driven to impress God. Christ lives in me.  The life you see me living is not "mine," but it is lived by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. 21 I am not going to go back on that.  Is it not clear to you that to go back to that old rule-keeping, peer-pleasing religion would be an abandonment of everything personal and free in my relationship with God?  I refuse to do that, to repudiate God's grace. If a living relationship with God could come by rule-keeping, then Christ died unnecessarily.   all my guys agreed, we don't even want to move one inch in our own lives; the life we now life is completely in Jesus; there's no room for will-power or for trying to make the Kingdom happen in my life because  urlLink  I'm dead meat...   I'm dead to myself, but very alive in Jesus, and hidden in God.   It was just so great that this truth (that I've read so many times) became something dynamic for us.   Keep on leading us into more truth Holy Spirit.    Our first duty as Christians is to get ourselves happy in God.  --Puritan saying

      I missed all of the Grammy Awards last night because I'm not watching TV right now.    no wait, that's a lie.  I missed the venerable music awards because i didn't want to watch them...   so I guess,   I really didn't miss anything.    Here's  urlLink the complete list of this year's winners.    I'm just so not into all the hype and the fake emotion any more.  And with all the drama surrounding NippleGate, I can't imagine how they actually produced the show.   Truthfully, all that music has no effect on me; I think I've hit a place where I really want everything to be focused on Him -- especially my talents.  When I see other people using those same talents for no good, it turns me right off.

       urlLink TheHeresy.com  has a really good post based on "tract" evangelism.  This is especially good:  ... following Christ is more like a marriage than signing up for a cell phone plan.  With a marriage we carefully consider whom we are going to be with. The commitment we make is lasts our entire life and it encompasses all aspects of our life.  But that isn't how we spread Christianity today.  Today becoming a Christian is much more like signing people up for a cell phone plan.  Sign up today and get a free phone.  The real cost of the phone in the monthly service plan.  Unfortunately people can drop out of this contract at any time.  I believe the issue of the gospel is crucial because there are subtle differences between following Christ and following the values of a subculture.  There are many people in the church that don't know Christ. They are just living out the values they absorbed from others in the church.   No more people joining our club.   I want to grow lovers in my cell and in my circle of influence.  Father help me be a farmer and not a sales associate...

      was reading  urlLink Brian McLaren's site  and he had this quote by Ed Chin:    "'... in my own devotional time this morning, I read John 3:31-32: The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. He testifies to what he has seen and heard... ( The Message  translates this passage as: "The earthbound is earthbound and speaks earth language; the heavenborn is in a league of his own. He sets out the evidence of what he saw and heard in heaven...") 'The primary reason I ever attend a church service (or, frankly, even have serious or long conversations with Christians) is the hope that I will hear something proclaimed out of heaven, something that carries the majesty, the revelation, the heart and breath of God. I want my heart to burn with a word from Heaven. I want to hear something which rumbles through the corridors of His chamber and then creates a sonic boom when it enters my earth space. I am not interested in a 3-point guide for living or recycled Oprah or political perspectives or even a Bible study or exploring "styles of worship."  And, I'm not looking for more apologetics and theology.  'I want the sound of Heaven to invade my heart, scare the hell out of me, and split me wide open. I want my "Edness" to spill out on the ground and for Him to take up residence in the suddenly empty vessel. 'We all know that the more traditional churches live in a ghetto of unreality; they speak only to themselves, write books for themselves, and make music for themselves. No one else has any clue what they're saying. That's why serious people have been ignoring them for a couple of decades. 'While I appreciate the freshness and youthfulness of "the emergent church" (or "postmodern church movement" as some call it), sometimes I think they have simply become better conversationalists. They’ve learned the language and the concepts of the natives and are very good about engaging them in real conversations. I greatly admire and enjoy that. But, very honestly, I’ve not heard very much in that world that really testifies of anything seen in Heaven. Like most other church worlds, they speak from a distinct “earthview” and in a distinct earth-language."    I don't want that to be said of me.  i don't want to become so impressed with my desire to create something relevant that my words and lifestyle become impotent.  I think this is why the renewal is so revolutionary; you have people experiencing raw God and yet, he won't let that experience ever fit into an established wineskin.  Brian McLaren says,   "[the Emergent movement] could just become another marketing gimmick to sell books, build egos, and bolster sagging spirits with a new invisible wardrobe for a pudgy, pasty old emporer. No doubt, in some quarters it will squander its potential, but if you care about the possibilites being actualized ... please ... let's aim deep and high."   I think it's  God Himself  that drives us on towards new expressions of Heaven and of Him.  His bride is too important, I just know that He would never let her stray too far from Him.  He always has this way of making  urlLink the truth win out .

      ever wonder what  urlLink Heaven  is like?   When the baby died, the angels carried him up to Heaven and rested him gently on a cloud. A man was there, also new, and they decided to tour Heaven together. 'Tell me about yourself,' said the baby, trying to put the man at ease. 'I was old. I died in my sleep. I had a long life, so I can't complain.' The man looked at the little baby before him. 'You, though. How could God let you die so young? It's cruel. It's unfair.' The baby just shrugged. They walked on. As the man walked, he grew angrier and angrier at God. 'How could God bless me with such a long life, and give this little one nothing? What did I do to deserve so much and him to deserve so little? How could God be so unfair? When I see God, I'm going to demand that he explain himself.' They continued walking, and finally they spotted God, who was taking a walk. Despite his anger, the man prostrated himself before God. The baby smiled and wiggled his toes. God welcomed them both. 'I don't want to question you, Lord, but something's bothering me,' said the man. 'I lived a long life. I had so many years, had so much happiness. Why did you deny this little baby such a life?' God looked at the man with kindness. 'Your pity is misplaced,' he finally said. 'It is not this child who deserves pity. Ask him about his life; get to know him. Then you will understand.' Then, embracing both of them, he walked away. The man was stunned. 'What on earth did that mean?' The baby only shrugged. Exasperated, the man said, 'Tell me about your life, then.' The baby grinned. 'Oh, it was wonderful there. Always warm. Everyone was so gentle, so kind. Everyone loved me. Whenever I was hungry, they fed me. When I was dirty, they cleaned me with warm water and soft touches. When I was lonely I had only to cry out and a beautiful woman would take me in her arms and rock me until I fell asleep."  The man sighed. "Never to have known betrayal, or hatred, or deceit. I cannot imagine such a life."  The baby looked around with the shock of recognition. "Come to think of it," he said, "it was a lot like this place!"    heaven is given to the children, right?

      well, i got into a car accident tonight.  Even better, I had four of the guys in my cell in the car.    Yeah, so my rear drivers side door is damaged (badly) and i think the rear driver side axel is bent ($$$$)... kind of sucks but I'm so glad there wasn't any damage to her car (other than some chipped paint).   She was a really nice young lady and she totally wasn't looking to get anything out of me.    I could totally see God's hand in all this though, it could have been much worse and his grace was over me a whole bunch in all of this.  Plus Steve and Kevin both know tons about body work and they said they could help me out if I thought i was being ripped off by my body shop.    Trying to decide what worship looks like right now.  He  is  faithful and I can see that He was working in this.  He's a big God and i believe he's going to do something BIG in all this.  He is so good!

         My friend Tracy says that cats are from the Fall.  I agree.  Now cats may have more than nine lives. The company that funded the first successful cloning of a domestic cat two years ago has gone commercial.  An e-mail sent in early February to the company's gene-banking clients offered to clone up to six cats. The cost? U.S. $50,000 each.   ...given that Animal shelters kill roughly four million animals each year because they're not adopted,  The Humane Society of the United States feels cloning new pets should not be done. The group encourages people who want a cat or dog to adopt one from a local shelter.  Can't believe this stuff.  It's funny that dogs are more difficult to clone apparently (more brain matter).  We're just getting closer and closer to the end of the world as I know it.   Soon, they'll be cloning Donald Trump.  I hope that bad toupeé isn't clone-able.

      so very tired lately, i haven't been sleeping more than about 5 or 6 hours a night (which is really bad for me because i can't survive without sleep)... i think it's stress.  some advice from  urlLink About.com :  How to improve your sleep   Don't expect to fall asleep immediately after hearing or watching disturbing news.  Stop watching or listening to news programs at least an hour before trying to go to sleep.  Leave the war news (or other bad news on the TV or radio) in the living room or den and out of the bedroom. Engage in a relaxing, non-alerting activity at bedtime such as reading or listening to music.     For some people, soaking in a warm bath or hot tub can be helpful. Avoid activities that are mentally or physically stimulating.  Do not eat or drink too much before bedtime.  Alcohol is not a sleep aid; don't use it to try to help you sleep.  Only get into bed when you're tired.  If you don't fall asleep within 15 minutes, get out of bed, go to another room and engage in a relaxing activity such as reading.  Return to your bed when you're sleepy. Create a sleep-promoting environment that is quiet, dark, cool and comfortable.    During the day:   Consume less or no caffeine.  Excess caffeine has the potential to disturb sleep at night.  If you feel tired during the day, substitute a short nap of about 15-20 minutes for caffeine.  Naps can relieve acute sleepiness and restore alertness, but for people suffering from insomnia, daytime naps should be avoided. Avoid alcohol and nicotine, especially close to bedtime. Exercise, but not within 3 hours before bedtime. ... good thing about the exercise because my butt is still in winter hibernation.

      We spend an enormous amount of energy making up our minds about other people. Not a day goes by without somebody doing or saying something that evokes in us the need to form an opinion about him or her. We hear a lot, see a lot, and know a lot. The feeling that we have to sort it all out in our minds and make judgments about it can be quite oppressive.  The desert fathers said that judging others is a heavy burden, while being judged by others is a light one. Once we can let go of our need to judge others, we will experience an immense inner freedom. Once we are free from judging, we will be also free for mercy. Let's remember Jesus' words: "Do not judge, and you will not be judged" (Matthew 7:1).   from  urlLink Nouwen.net  via . urlLink Liquidthinking.org .

Nichole Nordeman's version of Grace is awesome and there's a couple of really fresh versions of some quality U2 stuff.    I was talking to our Rep from  urlLink CMC  who told me that they've been having tons of trouble getting this CD into Canada.  It's a really sucky situation.  He said it almost looks like the only people who are going to be making money from this CD is Lawyers.    Boo.

      I just read an article from the updated  urlLink Heart of Worship  website.   Matt Redman says some good stuff that has me dreaming again: One of the biggest obstacles to consistently fervent worship in a local church is that we miss the magnitude of the occasion. We focus in on the four walls surrounding us, and that becomes our reality. We see and hear a group of people in or out of tune with each other - sometimes passionate, at other times a little apathetic. And that becomes our whole reality. But there is a bigger picture to be seen.  Most of us have found ourselves in the midst of a large crowd at some event or another. Whether it’s 5000 or 100,000 people, we experience an amazing dynamic when we’re part of that many gathered voices.  ... let’s be honest, singing our hearts out in a home group setting with three or four of our less vocally talented friends just isn’t the same somehow. Or is it? Perhaps it can be, if we somehow in our spirits grasp the bigger picture. However small or large a gathering, however in or out of tune we are musically, we are joining with the eternal flow of praise that rise every moment before the very throne of God.  ... Take a moment to put the sound of this worshipping choir into perspective. Imagine every language you’ve ever heard. Every accent and dialect. Every beautiful vocal sound. Add to that every harmony and every crowd, every choir, every large gathering. As these voices blend into one in your imagination, they are just the tiniest ripple of what is to come. One day every tribe and tongue will join this song. Multitudes and multitudes of passionate worshippers. Add now the sounds of all creation – every birdsong you ever woke to, every ocean wave you heard reach shore, every clap of thunder, every wild animal roar - and every time you experienced a wind whistling through the trees. Blend this sound with those cries of the nations, and the orchestration begins to take shape. Yet it is still a mere whisper.  Find the whole article  urlLink here .

      Well, back from another awesome encounter... this time we were at the  urlLink Ontario Camp for the Deaf  which was stunning.  Everything was frozen but it was so beautiful.  I went for a (too) short walk on Saturday after a nap and was completely amazed at how much God's creation sings out his beauty and faithfulness.    Made me think of  urlLink  The Darkling Thrush   by  urlLink Thomas Hardy  I leant upon a coppice gate      When Frost was spectre-gray, And Winter's dregs made desolate      The weakening eye of day. The tangled bine-stems scored the sky      Like strings of broken lyres, And all mankind that haunted nigh      Had sought their household fires.   The land's sharp features seemed to be      The Century's corpse outleant, His crypt the cloudy canopy,      The wind his death-lament. The ancient pulse of germ and birth      Was shrunken hard and dry, And every spirit upon earth      Seemed fevourless as I.  At once a voice arose among      The bleak twigs overhead In a full-hearted evensong      Of joy illimited; An aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,      In blast-beruffled plume, Had chosen thus to fling his soul      Upon the growing gloom.  So little cause for carolings      Of such ecstatic sound Was written on terrestrial things      Afar or nigh around, That I could think there trembled through      His happy good-night air Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew      And I was unaware. This poem's actually been on my mind for a while now.  It's funny how creation just knows to trust Him. All creation looks expectantly to you to give them their meals on time.  You come, and they gather around; you open your hand and they eat from it.  If you turned your back, they'd die in a minute - Take back your Spirit and they die, revert to original mud; Send out your Spirit and they spring to life - the whole countryside in bloom and blossom.   The glory of God - let it last forever! Let God enjoy his creation!   He takes one look at earth and triggers an earthquake, points a finger at the mountains, and volcanoes erupt.  Oh, let me sing to God all my life long, sing hymns to my God as long as I live!    urlLink Psalms 104:25 - 33

      Ok, the French are  nuts ...  Two top French nutritionists are telling people to go for a Big Mac and keep their fingers off the traditional French quiche. In an unexpected message to a country priding itself on the superiority of its food, a new food guide praises the McDonald's burger for having a higher and healthier protein-to-fat ratio than France's Quiche Lorraine.  "Strangely enough, the products which are the most demonized are not necessarily the worst," Jean-Michel Cohen and Patrick Serog write in their book "Savoir Manger," in which they analyze 5,000 dishes available in shops and restaurants. The verdict published this month comes as McDonald's launches a new campaign to add healthier food choices to its menus. It has also said it is eliminating Supersize fries and soft drinks.   urlLink Link

      I once got in a pretty heated argument with one of my best friends about the prounication of equinox (past argumentativeness isn't something I'm proud of)...  Anyway, I read this great article today.  So, what's the meaning of "equinox"??   ... whether you are entering the season of light or darkness, don't be fooled into thinking that on the equinox the length of the day is exactly equal to the length of the night. It's not.  The day of light and dark equality always happens before the spring and after the fall equinoxes, according Geoff Chester, a public affairs specialist with the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C.   "Exactly when it happens depends on where you are located on the surface of the Earth," he said. For example, in Washington, D.C., sunrise and sunset were exactly 12 hours apart on March 16. Solar balance occurred in Bogota, Colombia, on February 24.   By the time the center of the sun passes over Earth's Equator (the official definition of equinox) the day will be slightly longer than the night everywhere on Earth. The difference is a matter of geometry, atmosphere, and language.  And you better pronouncence it right, Jeremy...  Read the whole article  urlLink here .

          Find a small pebble or stone and carry it around with you for a week. Use it to symbolise the things you are sorry for, or the things that are heavy and which you have been carrying around.  At the end of the week, throw it away – perhaps into a river or the sea. Forgotten and left behind.  "If you are tired from carrying heavy burdens, come to me and I will give you rest." Jesus, in Matthew 11:28   From  urlLink ReJesus .

      Ok, i just told  urlLink Kenny  that I was going to try and stay away from  urlLink heavy  posts this week but  urlLink Pomomusings  had a really good  urlLink post  about being at a dance competition: I found myself slightly amused at the few dancers from other groups I saw who had absolutely no idea what was going on. They were improvising the whole time, trying to follow others who were in the front lines. They were always a few steps behind - I couldn't help but laugh at them a little [maybe not a full-out laugh; more of a chuckle]. They were lost. Strugglers.  And then I felt like an ass. Well, at least realized that I too am a struggler. I too am so often a few steps behind - struggling to find the beat, to get the moves down. We all are. We are dancers, trying to figure out the steps of life, the hand motions, the moves necessary to follow God - and we're not doing the best job at it. But somehow -- with the help of watching those who have the moves down a little better than us (or have been practicing more, or...hmm, maybe the Holy Spirit?) we're able to get through...to make it to the end... Pretty sweet truth.  I had one of these moments yesterday at an extra long band rehearsal - I was ready to tell everyone what to do (even though i wasn't leading the practice)... Holy Spirit was quick to get things in check when I made a  urlLink suggestion  that sounded awful.  It's good to swallow the humility pill and realize that I'm in the learning process too.  I'm thankful for those times when i see my own ass-ness... it reminds me there's more to the journey and it keeps my heart  urlLink humble .

      I've found a new Blog that i really enjoy reading.   urlLink Father Jake .  He is a self-confessed eccentric and sometimes heretical Anglican priest... but I love the stuff he is saying.   I think this may be appealing to the hunger for discipline that's growing in me.  He had a really good post  urlLink yesterday  about Grace.  He writes: When my youngest son was born, the nurse gave him to me to hold. I walked over to a corner of the room away from the bright lights, and rocked him in my arms as I whispered words of joy. He shook his tiny head, and struggled to open his eyes. We gazed into one another. Time stopped. Nothing but the flow of love between us existed. A moment of grace. A moment that seemed so natural, so spontaneous, and in some ways, so familiar. I had been to that place before. But I couldn't remember when, or where.  As the years went by, the grace flowed. As love was given, it was now returned; not because I was such a perfect father, or the most handsome, or the smartest; but because I was Dad.   This is the root of my understanding of our relationship with God. God is madly, head-over-heals in love with us, and woos us, and all of creation, into being, because we are. I have a hard time holding on to this foundational relationship. In day to day life, it doesn't fit very well. Head over there and read his discussion... I promise, it will make you re-evaluate grace.    Grace   She carries a pearl In perfect condition What once was hers What once was friction What left a mark No longer stains  Because grace makes beauty Out of ugly things  Grace finds beauty In everything  Grace finds goodness In everything   -U2

      God's been doing a lot lately in me as I've been reading  urlLink Celebration of Discipline  still... I'm really hungry to have God establish more truth in my daily patterns of life.  Read this and it resounded:  Henri Nouwen, Lenten Reflections on the Prodigal Son  Discipline is the human effort to create the space in which God can be generous and give you what you need. When you are fearful, worried, or anxious, you want to control your life and to hold onto the reins. You want to do it your own way, whether it's like the younger son or the older son. The practice of discipline is to let the Father touch you, let the Father forgive you, let the Father receive you. And for that you need to be available; you have to be home. You have to have an address if you want to be addressed. You have to be at home in order to receive a guest or to receive God. So disciplines are ways of creating a space, a home within, in which God can come into your life to forgive you, to heal you, and to bring you many gifts.  The first discipline is listening. The word listening in Latin is audire. And if you listen with great attention the words are ob audire. That is the word for 'obedience.' The word obedience means listening. If you are not listening, you are deaf. The Latin word for deaf is surdus, and if you're actually deaf, you're ab surdus. The 'absurd' life is a life in which you're not listening. And obedient life is a life in which you are listening. Quote via  urlLink Onehouse .

      Was reading  urlLink The Heresy  today and Leighton Tebay said some real things about Church conflict: It’s been 8 years since I finished my 3rd year at bible college.  I’ve watched many of my friends enter ministry and come out shattered and broken.  Most of my closest friends that went in to ministry aren’t in ministry any more.  They were so deeply wounded they changed their career.  In many cases they were treated unfairly with very little regard for their feelings.  Their critics were harsh and in some instances cowardly.    There is a big problem with the way we handle conflict in the church.  Some people feel they have the right to say whatever they want because it is the “truth”.  Some people feel they have the right to say whatever they want because they have been victimized.  What these people are not seeing is the profoundly negative impact their actions are having on the church in general.  Those who can’t see beyond their interpretation of the truth or their own hurt feelings have neutered the leadership of the church.  Some leaders are so deeply wounded that their faith in church and God is profoundly damaged.  They leave ministry in tens of thousands of dollars of debt with no other marketable skills.  For some they would rather make 8 dollars an hour than work in a church.  Many of the leaders that do survive learn how to play politics and keep people happy but are completely ineffective at actually leading or challenging the church.   Like most, I've experienced some awful church conflict in my time in Christendom.  I don't quite know what it is that makes us buck against pastors and leaders when we don't approve of a decision or opinion (or when they don't agree with my opinion).    I really like what Paul says in Ephesians 4:1-6 In light of all this, here's what I want you to do. While I'm locked up here, a prisoner for the Master, I want you to get out there and walk - better yet, run! - on the road God called you to travel. I don't want any of you sitting around on your hands. I don't want anyone strolling off, down some path that goes nowhere.  And mark that you do this with humility and discipline - not in fits and starts, but steadily, pouring yourselves out for each other in acts of love, alert at noticing differences and quick at mending fences.  You were all called to travel on the same road and in the same direction, so stay together, both outwardly and inwardly.  You have one Master, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who rules over all, works through all, and is present in all. Everything you are and think and do is permeated with Oneness.

       urlLink Jordon Cooper  had this great quote by Henri Nouwen:  "Freedom from judging, freedom for mercy  We spend an enormous amount of energy making up our minds about other people. Not a day goes by without somebody doing or saying something that evokes in us the need to form an opinion about him or her. We hear a lot, see a lot, and know a lot. The feeling that we have to sort it all out in our minds and make judgments about it can be quite oppressive. The desert fathers said that judging others is a heavy burden, while being judged by others is a light one. Once we can let go of our need to judge others, we will experience an immense inner freedom. Once we are free from judging, we will be also free for mercy. Let's remember Jesus' words: 'Do not judge, and you will not be judged' (Matthew 7:1)" It reminds me of a story  urlLink Pastor Steve Long , here at TACF, told once.   The gist is that he was severly offended by someone.  He went to God and said "I want justice... this is unfair.  I haven't done anything wrong to this person God.  They have no right to act the way they have."   God said, "are you sure you want justice Steve?"   Steve: "Yes!!  This is not fair and I want what's fair."   God: "Go to hell."   Steve: "...ok, maybe I don't want justice Father."

      it's my  Happy Birthday!   so, according to  urlLink Encarta  and  urlLink Wikipedia , on this day 1834: Toronto, Ontario, (originally called York) is incorporated as a city.   1899: Bayer registeres aspirin as a trademark (i'm actually allergic to aspirin...)  1836: About 170 Texans perish at the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, when approximately 3,000 Mexicans commanded by general Antonio Lopes de Santa Anna overrun the Republic of Texas garrison.   1980: Novelist Marguerite Yourcenar becomes the first female member of the Académie Francçaise.   1981: Walter Cronkite, longtime anchor of the CBS evening news, signs off for the last time.  Other people born on this day: Michelangelo, Italian painter, sculptor, architect, and poet (1475)  Elizabeth Barrett Browning, English poet, political thinker, and feminist (1806)  Valentina Tereshkova, Soviet cosmonaut and first woman to fly in space (1937) I also thought, since it's my day, I should post an amazing poem:  Pied Beauty   GLORY be to God for dappled things—     For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;       For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;   Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches’ wings;     Landscape plotted and pieced—fold, fallow, and plough;              And áll trádes, their gear and tackle and trim.      All things counter, original, spare, strange;     Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)       With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;   He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:                            Praise him.   Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844–89)  Poems , 1918.  This is probably my favourite poem of all time... it reminds me to look for the beauty and the handiwork of God in everything.  Even though this past year has had its challenges, I have seen my Father's love and grandeur in so many new ways...    Here's to another year!

      Saw  urlLink The Passion of the Christ  on Sunday night.  Man it destroyed me.    There were a few times I felt like I was going to lose it... I mean,  I was crying for most of the movie, but a few times I couldn't control the weird combination of grief and love that was building in my chest and I felt like I needed to either wail or explode.   I didn't explode.    The most difficult aspect of the movie was watching Jesus carrying his cross.  Don't get me wrong, the scourging and the actual crucifixion were dreadful… but watching him drag the object that would mean his death was too much for me.  At one point he falls and just as his mother comes over to him he says, “see Mother, I make all things new.”  I had to describe it to a few friends and my sister on Monday and all I could say was that it was horrible and awesome.   The torture and pain he suffered was apparent in a new and terrible way… and yet  The Passion of the Christ  I walked away thinking “that’s my Jesus…” and loving him so much more than ever.  The only thing about this movie that makes me a bit disappointed is how some people are using it as a tool to shove the gospel down the throats of pre-believers.   urlLink Paradox talks about his 2nd viewing  of the film and how two guys got up and tried to do an altar call.    I’m kind of torn on this.  I felt like doing an altar call after I watched the movie and looked at the shocked faces of people leaving the theatre.  I could tell they were recognizing not just the scope of what Jesus did but also the love present in that act.  But for some reason the world (or at least my perception of it) tends to have a strong distaste for Christianity  on the offensive .    I  did   pray for them afterwards in the car and at Billy’s place that night.    I’m hoping that for each one, there would be someone in their lives who could throw out a net that they would respond to.  And I pray that Father  would  use this movie as a tool… in the same way he uses a sunset or his word or a death in the family or a street preacher to bring his children home.

      "Lent can be more than a time of fasting; it can be a season of feasting. We can use Lent to fast from certain things and to feast on others." Lent is a season in which we can:  Fast from judging others; feast on the Christ dwelling in them.  Fast from emphasis on differences; feast on the unity of life.  Fast from apparent darkness; feast on the reality of light.  Fast from, thoughts of illness; feast on the healing power of God.  Fast from words that pollute; feast on phrases that purify.  Fast from discontent; feast on gratitude.  Fast from anger; feast on patience.  Fast from pessimism; feast on optimism.  Fast from worry; feast on divine order.  Fast from complaining; feast on appreciation.  Fast from negatives; feast on affirmatives.  Fast from unrelenting pressure; feast on unceasing prayer.  Fast from hostility; feast on nonresistance.  Fast from bitterness; feast on forgiveness.  Fast from self-concern; feast on compassion for others.  Fast from personal anxiety; feast on eternal truth.  Fast from facts that depress; feast on verities that uplift.  Fast from discouragements; feast on hope.  Fast from lethargy; feast on enthusiasm.  Fast from thoughts that weaken; feast on promises that inspire.  Fast from shadows of sorrow; feast on the sunlight of serenity.  Fast from idle gossip; feast on purposeful silence.  Fast from problems that overwhelm; feast on prayer that undergirds.  from a Benedictine website as quoted in The Tablet, 3 March 2001, p. 325   via  urlLink Jordon Cooper  via  urlLink Grace Lent Blog .

      My  urlLink sister  downloaded a  urlLink virus  yesterday on my home computer and it's a beast.    She's been looking for a full-time summer job lately and she's sent out tons of resumeés... yesterday afternoon she received an email (from an unknown email address) with just the text, "here's your application"... and an attachment (which was actually a virus).  I thought all well-meaning computer amateurs would know to  NEVER  open an attachment from someone you don't know.    Anyway, i spent about an hour cleaning up my hard drive last night.  It doesn't look like i'll have to reformat.  Thank God that I paid to keep on retreving updates for my  urlLink Norton Anti-virus  because this was a brand new virus.    I need to ask the question: who are these virus-creating people?  Can't they use their power for  urlLink good  instead of  urlLink evil ??    And why make viruses?? I mean, you can't see all the angry people...  like me

      This is amazing.  It looks like they've found it... the Ark.   The Trinity Corporation today announced that they have collected new satellite images taken over Mount Ararat in Eastern Turkey that will add a new twist to an exploration that has been going on for centuries. The images, which were revealed at a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, DC today, reveal a man- made structure at the site where the Bible states Noah's Ark came to rest. The first pictures of the site, taken by the U.S. Air Force in 1949, revealed what seemed to be a structure covered by ice, but were held in a confidential file labeled "Ararat Anomaly" for years. In 1997, the government released several of these images, but experts deemed them inconclusive.  The summer of 2003 provided a great opportunity to take a new series of photographs. It was the hottest summer in Europe since 1500, which caused a massive meltdown on Mount Ararat. It's a really good article.  It's also interesting that the American Government has kept the info secret for a long time.  Read the whole thing  urlLink here .

       It’s the soft underbelly of church that I love. Most churches have a soft side, but it’s hard to see it because of the hard lacquer of organization and marketing that forms over time. If you let this shell get thick enough, it almost seems like the shell is all you have. And that’s not what church should be.  One of our goals for our church is to keep this veneer from forming. We want to keep the soft things exposed because the soft things are the truth and all that really matters.   It takes a lot of intentional work to stay soft. It makes us vulnerable and even weak. It makes us unorganized and a little messy.  It makes us children in the Great Kingdom. Tru Dat. from  urlLink Real Live Preacher .

       Now there are four little boys at our church, all about the same age, all hovering around three. Kevin, Steven, Jacob, and Adam. And a merrier band of swashbuckling fellows you've never met in all your life. I want you to imagine the four of them, arms around each other's shoulders, fists full of toy trucks, plastic swords shoved in their belts, singing at the top of their lungs because the world is a great place and everyone loves them. Imagine that and you’re getting the picture. This is awesome because i think every man has one of these guys inside (whether they know it or not).  It also reminds me of my amazing mates (Billy and Adam) and how hanging with them just makes me want to climb stuff, laugh, and be a son to my pop.  from an amazing  urlLink story  (Real Live Preacher).

          Give up something that matters  Close your eyes for a moment and think of something that you just can't live without. Your morning cup of latte? How about that gin and tonic after work? Or your favourite television programme?.     Make a pact with yourself that starting right now, you will forego that pleasure for an entire week (or a month, in the case of a weekly activity). Don't wait for Monday or any other "right time". Just do it now.  Tell God your plans and ask for his help in sticking with it. And when it's time for that latte or television program, have a quick chat with God about it or anything else that comes into your mind.  Note: Fasting normally involves abstaining from meals or specific foods for a certain length of time – for example, not eating at all for 24 hours or skipping lunch for a week. Health considerations are important, so if you have an eating or metabolic disorder, fasting from food is not an option for you. There are other ways to fast, though. Soap operas, shopping for little luxuries and eating chocolate are all good targets for fasting! And then there's silence. How about no talking for an hour, or even a day?  Try to spend the time you free up to give something to others – write a letter, run an errand, send an email or pray for them.  "When you go without eating, don't try to look gloomy as those show-offs do when they go without eating. I can assure you that they already have their reward. Instead, comb your hair and wash your face. Then others won't know that you are going without eating. But your Father sees what is done in private, and he will reward you." Jesus, in Matthew 6:6-18   From  urlLink ReJesus .

      Looks like Shakespeare's coined words (including the two in this post's title) are now common currency... While William Shakespeare died 388 years ago this week, the English playwright and poet lives on not only through his writings, but through the words and sayings attributed to him that still color the English language today.  Some Shakespeare-coined phrases: • Eaten out of house and home • Pomp and circumstance • Foregone conclusion • Full circle • The makings of • Method in the madness • Neither rhyme nor reason • One fell swoop • Seen better days • It smells to heaven • A sorry sight • A spotless reputation • Strange bedfellows • The world's (my) oyster Really interesting article (ok ... maybe it's only interesting for English-buffs like me).

      I'm having a Robert Frost day today so I decided to post some of my favourites:  Meeting and Passing   As I went down the hill along the wall There was a gate I had leaned at for the view And had just turned from when I first saw you As you came up the hill. We met. But all We did that day was mingle great and small Footprints in summer dust as if we drew  The figure of our being less that two But more than one as yet. Your parasol Pointed the decimal off with one deep thrust. And all the time we talked you seemed to see  Something down there to smile at in the dust. (Oh, it was without prejudice to me!) Afterward I went past what you had passed Before we met and you what I had passed   On Looking Up By Chance at the Constellations   You'll wait a long, long time for anything much To happen in heaven beyond the floats of cloud And the Northern Lights that run like tingling nerves. The sun and moon get crossed, but they never touch, Nor strike out fire from each other nor crash out loud. The planets seem to interfere in their curves But nothing ever happens, no harm is done. We may as well go patiently on with our life, And look elsewhere than to stars and moon and sun For the shocks and changes we need to keep us sane. It is true the longest drouth will end in rain, The longest peace in China will end in strife. Still it wouldn't reward the watcher to stay awake In hopes of seeing the calm of heaven break On his particular time and personal sight. That calm seems certainly safe to last to-night.   The Vantage Point   If tires of trees I seek again mankind, Well I know where to hie me--in the dawn, To a slope where the cattle keep the lawn. There amid loggin juniper reclined, Myself unseen, I see in white defined Far off the homes of men, and farther still, The graves of men on an opposing hill, Living or dead, whichever are to mind.  And if by noon I have too much of these, I have but to turn on my arm, and lo, The sun-burned hillside sets my face aglow, My breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze, I smell the earth, I smell the bruisèd plant, I look into the crater of the ant.

      was reading  urlLink Liquidthinking  before work this morning and was taken aback by some thoughts, I don't know what to do with things like "Turn the other cheek"; "Sell your possessions and give to the poor"; "I came not to bring peace but a sword"; and "Don't worry about tomorrow"? I don't think Jesus was kidding, so what the heck I'm I supposed to do with it all?  We are so quick to judge. Next time you're tempted to think a bad thought about someone, just remember you don't know what they are facing in life and you don't know what you might be like if you were in their situation. Take the time to know someone's story, then, when you might possibly have the right to judge you probably won't want to anyway.  What would it be like if the criteria for telling someone about Jesus was that you must be willing to die for them? What would that change? Paul said that if his being cut off from Christ meant that his Jewish brothers could find salvation, he would do it...can you imagine that?  I've often thought, how far would I go to show God's love.  I mean, I've said  urlLink I would die  for my faith but if I was actually faced with that situation I wonder if my passion would still be strong... Also, all that stuff about turning the other cheek and selling my possessions is really easy to teach but really difficult to live.    Recently, someone told a half-truth and it ended up looking like  urlLink my sister  had made decisions that were not hers to make (here at church… sorry if that sounds unclear).  Basically, she was being used as a scapegoat and it made me really angry.   Then yesterday, my good friend Sarah challenged me as I was sharing my frustration (read:  urlLink gossiping ).     Sarah : “I think you’ve picked up an offence Andrew.”  Me : “Crap, I think you’re right.”  It’s difficult to not pick up an offence when it’s someone you really care about.  (That kind of sounds like I still want justice and not mercy… boo)  Father, help me to live a  urlLink lifestyle  of  urlLink forgiveness .

       (1) people want to see a more honest reality, and the pomo [postmodern] church does that a little better than the modern church.. the latter finds itself too often being the answer dispenser, while the pomo church is more capable at showing the raw footages, the real angst of unanswered prayers, the reality of things not always turning out okay in a 30-minute sermon, the open ending, but yet real people holding on to hope, in God and in the community.. (cf. 1 Peter 3:15), let the camera's run 24/7 (2) life unscripted, let's see how things happen in real life, unrehearsed (3) The Apprentice is about business, nothing personal; The Church is about being/doing together, it is personal -- love one another is the big commandment from The One, regardless of chemistry or personality, we're in the Body of Christ, we share in The Family, we have to work together for The Mission..  (4) The Donald has bad hair and a coupla billions in the City; The Savior has great white hair full of wisdom, owns it all, and is building a New City, and says you're hired to do the best job for Him, and get the best perks as shareholders (cf. Rom 8:17) from  urlLink DJ Chuang's website .

      So  urlLink it 's over.  I just did a  urlLink quiz     I am like  urlLink Bill    --  "I'm a trained killer - in business."     Bill was the Project Manager for the Celebrity Auction Challenge, the Pedicab Challenge, was in Interview Round for the Final Four and the final Golf Tournament Charity Event Challenge.  Been looking online a whole lot today.   urlLink Jeremy  said some excellent stuff  urlLink here .  The best things I've found though, is about Omarosa from  urlLink USA Today  Omarosa ... could host an Apprentice for divas. Whether trash-talking her competitors, overacting an injury or deliberately (or accidentally) sabotaging finalist Kwame, she's big enough to go by just one name. (If Trump gave her a company to run — perhaps into the ground — that would probably be worth a spinoff.)  I guess her next stop will be Oprah.

      So, I've now done the  urlLink Life Languages  test... and man is this stuff right on!  I totally "borrowed" the table from  urlLink Kenny ...  This is  my  life languages breakdown. I'm a Shaper-Influencer-Producer-Responder.       Language  Score  Rating    Shaper  67.7%  High    Influencer  62.6%  Moderate    Producer  62.1%  Moderate    Responder  52.5%  Moderate    Mover  42.4%  Moderate    Doer  37.4%  Moderate    Contemplator  27.3%  Low    High Intensity  74.73  Range Moderate     As a HIGH SHAPER, you tend to be organized, visionary, focused, delegating, strategic, and efficient.  You can be quite articulate, especially when it comes to sharing your plans and vision. Generally, you can do this in a very persuasive manner, ensuring that others catch your vision.  The Shaper's major desire is TO LEAD, and Shapers lead others automatically and naturally through planning and delegating.  Shapers feel loved, valued, and motivated by receiving from others SUPPORT AND AGREEMENT: support in their plans and agreement of shared values, goals, purpose, and destiny. Shapers are not interested in agreement just for the sake of agreement, as would be the case with a "yes" person, but they are concerned with genuine compatibility of goals and direction. Because Shapers are generally in leadership roles, and leaders are often targets of criticism, they need the security and calm of safe, supportive relationships.  It's all really interesting stuff.  I really enjoyed doing the test and learning about the different types.  I also learned a few ways I can improve: keeping sensitivity to people as well as the project, choose to trust others, taking time to relax, reflect, and relate.

      I want the will of God.    Lost something yesterday and was a bit disappointed.  Even though it wasn't meant to be, I thought of this poem:  One Art   The art of losing isn't hard to master; so many things seem filled with the intent to be lost that their loss is no disaster.  Lose something every day. Accept the fluster of lost door keys, the hour badly spent. The art of losing isn't hard to master.  Then practice losing farther, losing faster: places, and names, and where it was you meant  to travel. None of these will bring disaster.  I lost my mother's watch. And look! my last, or next-to-last, of three loved houses went. The art of losing isn't hard to master.  I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster, some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent. I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster.  --Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture I love) I shan't have lied.  It's evident the art of losing's not too hard to master though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.  Elizabeth Bishop  from   The Complete Poems 1927-1979

Do you hold doors open for others using the back of your hand...which may I add is covered by your sleeve?...like I do? Do you press the STOP REQUESTED button on the bus with your wrist like I do? Do you flush the toilet in public restrooms with your shoe like I do?  I am guilty of opening doors (especially restroom doors) with my sleeved hand.

Even though this is difficult, I really feel like the Lord is going to show you that you’re on the right path.  Sarah, my amazing sister, I love you.  When do you fly out? Andrew   From: 	Sarah Dailey   To:	Andrew Gazaneo Subject:	RE: Sorry  My heart is killing me. I know it was crazy fast. Felt like a confirmation to me when Dave talked to me last night. Thank you so much for understanding...I know God is telling me to move back home. I'm really excited about it, and nervous all at once. I've learned so much from being here...I don't regret coming here, not for a second.  I love you too Drew. My sweet friend.  I'm not sure when I'm flying out. My mom is sending me a flight confirmation when she books the flight. She's paying for it obviously. Joanna and Nicola are still coming to visit me in May. That's gonna be amazing to see them. I don't wanna say goodbye...harden my heart..shut it down!!!! NO!!!  From: 	Andrew Gazaneo   To:	Sarah Dailey Subject:	RE: Sorry  It sucks that you’re leaving, but DON’T SHUT YOUR HEART DOWN.  NOPE.  DON’T DO IT!  I’M WARNING YOU.  DON’T!  Aww Sarah, it’s ok to say goodbye.  And it’s ok for it to hurt too.   See if you can at least stay for all of Fresh Wind, ok?   Andrew   From: 	Sarah Dailey   To:	Andrew Gazaneo Subject:	RE: Sorry  CRAP, I forgot about Fresh Wind. ARG. i have to call my momma. I don't think I'll work..I'll just go to the whole thing for free!! Yup.  I have to go...I know you're sad I'm leaving. Pull it together man...suck it up. You'll get over it. =) Sarah  From: 	Andrew Gazaneo   To:	Sarah Dailey Subject:	RE: Sorry  It really IS SAD… I wish there was some way you didn’t have to leave us Sarah.  Have you told your girls?  They must be bawling by now.  This overall sucks from our perspective, but I really think God is going to lead you into even better stuff.  I pray you have his peace today as you start to get things in order.   Andrew   From: 	Sarah Dailey   To:	Andrew Gazaneo Subject:	RE: Sorry   No, I told Sarah [her roommate] last night. She was kinda weird about it.   Thanks for your prayers Andrew. We'll talk about it later. Maybe I'll just leave on Friday and tell everyone then. So right then i get an email from her roommate From: Sarah Wagler To: Andrew Gazaneo Subject:   Hey Drew. Sarah said she told you the news. Don't tell her I told you this, but I"m glad she's leaving. Just between us, things have not been working out in the room. She just drives me crazy, i know she feels the same way about me. One week til freedom!!  see you.   From: Andrew Gazaneo  To: Sarah Wagler Subject: RE:   Holy cow Sarah, that's kind of harsh Andrew   From: Sarah Wagler  To: Andrew Gazaneo Subject: RE:   Andrew, you don't even know what it's like. Knowing that she's going just takes a weight off my shoulders. Ah, this day is just getting better and better.   From: Andrew Gazaneo  To: Sarah Wagler Subject: RE:   OMG Sarah.  I think it's really sad that she's leaving.  I guess living arrangements and stuff can be hard sometimes, but Sarah's a great friend.  I think you'll miss her once she's gone. Andrew   From: Sarah Wagler  To: Andrew Gazaneo Subject: RE:   I doubt it. I think everyone feels the same way.   From: Andrew Gazaneo  To: Sarah Wagler Subject: RE:   Holy cow, what is going on?  Are you drunk or something?  Woman, think about what you're saying!!!  Sarah's awesome.  Just because you're on crack doesn't mean everyone's glad she's leaving.   Man Sarah, I think that's pretty rude.  What's is going on with you? Andrew  At this point I was freaking out so I ran over to their office.  As i walked in, Sarah (Dailey) had her back to me and was just telling someone "yeah, and I can't believe he's falling for all of this..."  Then she turned around and started howling.  ok, so it's Sarah 1, Andrew 0...   we are not amused.

       I'd like pews that are more like the theater seats...you know, where you can raise or lower the armrests and even recline a little. I'd really like that. I want to feel appreciated. Maybe a statue in my honor...or just a simple plaque on the wall. I think a personalized parking place may be a little much, but it would help me to feel appreciated. Again, I'd still like to see more sexy people in churches. Like, is there a supermodel church or something? That would really be my kind of thing. Actually, it could just be sexy women. I don't really want my wife (who is a sexy woman) looking at sexy men...especially during church. Fewer anouncements. I mean, did Jesus make anouncements? I don't think that's WWJD material. Heck, let's just go with no anouncements. That's probably a more Scriptural approach. Some type of free work-out facility. Gyms these days cost too much money. That's my excuse. I'm certain that if I had a church that had a free work-out facility I would actually do it and be a healthier person. That would also help me to fit in with the other sexy church goers. I want a pastor who understands me. That would probably lead to him appreciating me more (see above desire). And that way when he's preaching he could look at me and we could exchange those knowing glances...maybe even wink at each other. YOu know, like we've got some kind of inside joke. Some type of chocolate covered almond candy...I really like chocolate and almonds. Also... fewer people that I don't like. People I don't like bug me. Donuts - The good kind. With the frosting put on just right. To much glaze makes me sick and distracts me from worshipping properly. Bagels might be a better alternative to the sexy church... but if there is a free work out room I can always spend a few more minutes on the stairmaster. Excitement - I think there should be hand clapping, people who don't like hand clapping need to lighten up. Hand clapping may be the sole reason God gave us hands. That and the Michealangelo painting on the ceiling of that one place over in that foreign place. Yes enthusiasm is important. as long as noone gets to happy. I dont want any blues brothers churches services. from  urlLink liquidthinking , makers of the  urlLink True Love Waits Condom  - For when it's not True Love.

      this is funny:   Left Behind left behind:   Rapture occurs, sales of popular series plummets  Authors and publishers hurt by lost revenue, agonies of tribulation  The global disappearance of Christians earlier this week attributed to the "rapture" predicted by premillennial theologians, and the corresponding disappearance of Left Behind books from bestseller lists have left authors Tim LaHaye, Jerry B. Jenkins, and their publishers discouraged and soul-searching. They're also disappointed that they were not among the airplane pilots, school bus drivers, or toll booth operators taken up to heaven in the wink of an eye, leaving behind piles of empty clothing as well as chaos, terror, and inconvenience, respectively.   When asked why the rapture hurt sales of a series that would seem more timely than ever, Jenkins commented, "Apparently the folks who've actually been left behind aren't interested in reading about it. And I can see why - it's a real kick in the teeth for me personally. This goes way beyond bitter irony."   Related headlines:    BUSH RAPTURED!

      Reading Andy Mullins'  urlLink Blog  and he says some good stuff about ChurchÂ© The corporate church is about reputation not righteousness. Its not about repentance and vulnerability. This world is so jacked, why do we really care whether someone else thinks we have it all together.  The church must embrace our broken, wicked hearts and allow us to struggle.  Who is unfit for ministry the man who confesses his sins or the man who feigns that he has no sin. Today the church would rather have a liar than a struggling growing believer.  I think one of the most difficult things to do help people to deal with their sin.  Being a cell leader gives me this ongoing privilege... but it does take a lot of grace  and  a lot of brokenness on my part.  Sometimes it almost feels like the blind leading the blind... but I have to believe God has put me in these people's lives for a reason.  I can be in process  and  lead them forward.   urlLink i think .

      Darkness is an unlit wick A simple spark would vanquish it Truly I could burst to flame Every time you call my name Do I do for you the same?  In our ever-present need of Thee Grant we fathom peace Fashion instruments of souls set free For don't the caged ones weep?  God is like a honeybee Penetrates the soul of me Truly draws the sweetness in  Nectar of the meek ones is He in me and I in Him  In our ever-present need of Thee Grant we fathom peace Fashion instruments of souls set free For don't the caged ones weep?  Sometimes sober, sometimes bliss Every union knows of this I have stood here in His rain Bear the marks of fertile plains Swelling streams & swollen grain  In our ever-present need of Thee Grant we fathom peace Fashion instruments of souls set free For don't the caged ones weep?  So will I console the fog Of cheerless creatures great & small What of sadness can endure When love divine makes insecure The growing claims of shame's allure  -- St. Francis of Assisi

         Sonnet 17 by Pablo Neruda     Aw, you're a romantic. You believe in true love and all that sort of stuff. How cute are you? To you, love is incredible and amazing.   urlLink     urlLink Which poem are you?   To be honest, I'm really surprised with my results.  I thought I'd get something more traditional like Shakespeare's  urlLink Sonnet 116  or Blake's  urlLink The Tyger .  Anyway, here's Neruda's poem:  I do not love you as if you were the salt-rose, or topaz, or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off. I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul.  I love you as the plant that never blooms but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers; thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance, risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body.  I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride; so I love you because I know no other way  than this: where I does not exist, nor you, so close that your hand on my chest is my hand, so close that your eyes close as I fall asleep.

      God's really been hanging out with me lately.  I know that sounds vague, but it's my reality.  We've been just laying in bed together, he's sat beside me in the car while i'm driving, stood beside me as I installed new lighting fixtures in our family room...  It's good; I think he's getting my heart used to his everyday presence.  His peace and love and kindness with me every moment.  Linda Cho said to me today, "I realized that so much of my identity was wrapped up in other people's love for me, and I can't live like that, because then my foundation is built on the sand!  I realized I needed to be grounded in God, the solid rock."  I think I'm really getting my identity from Him right now. I read  urlLink this  on  urlLink liquidthinking.org  and it made a lot of sense.   I sort of had a vision/imagination last night where I pictured Jesus and me sitting on the deck in my backyard. It was in the cool of an early morning. Both of us were drinking coffee and staring off into a hazy nothing. No words were spoken. We just sat there. After a while we looked at each other for a second like we were going to say something, but then we laughed like two friends who share some kind of inside jokes or too many close calls, and we didn't need to say anything to bring the memories of them flooding back. Then we continued drinking our coffee and staring off into the haze with little smiles on our faces.

      do you ever have one those moments where you feel like you're really,  really  alive?  I read the following quote today on  urlLink OneHouse  and thought about those moments... and how they seem to be right there when I need them.   The settled happiness and security which we all desire, God withholds from us by the very nature of the world: but joy, pleasure, and merriment, He has scattered broadcast. We are never safe, but we have plenty of fun, and some ecstasy.  It is not our hard to see why.  The security we crave would teach us to rest our hearts in this world and oppose an obstacle to our return to God: a few moments of happy love, a landscape, a symphony, a merry meeting with our friends, a bathe or a football match, have no such tendency. Our Father refreshes us on the journey with some pleasant inns, but will not encourage us to mistake them for home.  (C.S. Lewis -  urlLink The Problem of Pain )

      So, because I'm going to be in jolly old  urlLink England  for the month of July doing some ministry with my amazing  urlLink pastors  and some of my cell guys I figured, why not go back to Belfast?   I was there in January 2003 and have still got some connections there (thank God for Deirdre!)  How the heck could I go all the way to England and not see a city that's got a big piece of my heart???  So Stephen and I are heading over...  I  urlLink searched  and  urlLink searched  and  urlLink searched , and I finally found seats for dirt cheap.  Our flights  to  Belfast are  ZERO  dollars.  Really.  I mean it.  All I had to pay was the taxes (is that awesome or what???)  Just finished booking our flights back to London and we had to a bit more but I'm ok with that.    Man, i can't wait to be there.  Can't wait to see the people, eat the cheese, and see the city.  (Oh, and drink the beer...)

      So the price of petrol is becoming criminal.  Thank God I filled up yesterday at  82.5 cents a litre  ... can't believe that price is actually a deal.    Anyway, lots of people are freaking out.  I really like what  urlLink Leighton Tebay  says  urlLink here : The price of gas has risen to all time highs.  Our government is benefiting because they collect more GST at the pump.  Our 3 main political parties each have different solutions.   Conservatives: Charge GST on only the first 85 cents a litre.  The solution to everything is to lower taxes.  Liberals: Put extra revenue from gas taxes in to medical equipment:  Buy stuff we can't afford to pay anyone to operate.  NDP: Regulate the price of gas.  Because we know the big oil companies are screwing us over all the time.  It doesn't matter that one Canadian province already does this and it makes no difference to the price of gas.  HEY, HERE IS A THOUGHT!  Take the money from gas taxes and invest it in to alternative fuel research and clean air technology.  It is GOOD that we are paying through the nose because we have to stop using fossil fuels.  The longer we wait the deeper the economic impact will be when we finally run out.  Easing the pain now will just make it more difficult tomorrow.  or else we could just take the  urlLink TTC  more.

      Stumbled across one of my most favourite poems today.  It's by Denise Levertov and it's about the poet Caedmon.  Basically Caedmon's story is told in Bede’s Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum (find the original version  urlLink here .)  So Caedmon lived as a labourer at the monastery of Whitby, founded in 657.  Unfortunately, Caedmon was pretty much mute.  One night, the servants of the monastery were gathered about the table for good-fellowship and the harp was passed from hand to hand (as was often done.)  Caedmon, knowing nothing of poetry and unable to sing, left the company in shame.  He went back to the stable with the cattle.  As he slept, there stood by him in a vision a person who called him by name, and asked him to sing.  "I cannot sing, and therefore I left the feast."  "Sing to me, however, sing of Creation."  So Caedmon began to sing in praise of God verses that he’d never heard before.  This is so significant because this is recognized as the beginning of English sacred poetry.  He was the first English Christian Poet.  This is his poem (in modern English): Now let me praise the keeper of Heaven's kingdom,  the might of the Creator, and his thought,  the work of the Father of glory, how each of wonders  the Eternal Lord established in the beginning.  He first created for the sons of men  Heaven as a roof, the holy Creator,  then Middle-earth the keeper of mankind,  the Eternal Lord, afterwards made,  the earth for men, the Almighty Lord.  Now this is Denise Levertov's brilliant poem from Caedmon's perspective: All others talked as if talk were a dance. Clodhopper I, with clumsy feet would break the gliding ring. Early I learned to hunch myself close by the door: then when the talk began I'd wipe my mouth and wend unnoticed back to the barn to be with the warm beasts, dumb among body sounds of the simple ones. I'd see by a twist of lit rush the motes of gold moving from shadow to shadow slow in the wake of deep untroubled sighs. The cows munched or stirred or were still. I was at home and lonely, both in good measure. Until the sudden angel affrighted me--light effacing my feeble beam, a forest of torches, feathers of flame, sparks upflying: but the cows as before were calm, and nothing was burning, nothing but I, as that hand of fire touched my lips and scorched my tongue and pulled my voice into the ring of the dance. Isn't it awesome?    Portions from  urlLink Ian Lancashire  a brilliant professor at  urlLink U of T .

      This is amazing! WITH every rib in his little body broken and his lungs on the verge of collapsing, seven-year-old Tyler Moon trudged through 2km of bushland to save his father's life.  Tyler and dad David, 40, had been zooming around on the family's quad bike in bushland next to their property near Milton, on the New South Wales south coast.   But in a freak accident on Saturday morning, the bike hit a large wedge of wood and jolted suddenly, throwing the pair over the handlebars.   The bike landed on top of David, with the motor still running.  Read the whole article  urlLink here .

      So i was watching (to my  urlLink chagrin ) the  urlLink Dateline NBC  special last night on " urlLink Friends ."  I was forced because my sister and mom desperately wanted to watch it.  Anyway, at one point they read the original pitch for the show (written over a decade ago) and something stuck out at me.  One of the hosts said, It’s about being at a point in our lives where anything and everything is possible.   Looking for intimacy, and love, and relationship yet being afraid of intimacy, and love, and relationship. All I could think was, that's exactly the experience of being a Young Adult.

       Years ago I sat in a worship service listening to a retarded girl in her twenties sing a song she had written. She started slowly, awkwardly, the room felt uncomfortable. As she sang the words were difficult to understand her pitch and timing were absolutely terrible. Strangely something about her song brought me to worship. The next woman to sing had an amazing opera voice. I'm sure it was a beautiful song but it was anything but contemporary. I suppose I felt it was unworthy for true worship. The next girl to sing was the pastor's daughter. Like the second woman, she too had a beautiful voice, I had never met her but she seem very snooty, she sang a contemporary worship song, one that I liked, but I sat annoyed by her singing.   Looking back over the years I've thought about that situation many times. Was it anointing? My attitude? Their attitudes?  I had grace for the retarded girl and not for the other ladies. My lack of grace cause me to miss out on worship an activity that helps me or were they just performances I didn't like, simple as that.  Regardless, I think a lot of pressure has been put on music ministers to perform and deliver excellence. I don't think Jesus is critical of a persons singing voice, or style of music. I do believe he looks at the heart. Maybe we need better ways of teaching excellence in the heart.  from  urlLink Liquidthinking

       urlLink    I want  urlLink One .  I've always had this ongoing fascination with  urlLink Macs ... but the new  urlLink Powerbooks  are so powerful and sleek.  I really admire Macs for that great combo they seem to always pull off.  Too bad they're so expensive.   Anyone feel like buying me an early Christmas present?

      I know, i know, like I need  another  reason to love Costco... Indeed, Costco's pay is much, much, much better -- a full-time Costco clerk or warehouse worker earns more than $41,000 a year, plus getting terrific health-care coverage. Wal-Mart workers get barely a third of that pay, plus a lousy health-care plan. Costco even has unions!  Yet, Costco's labor costs are only about half of Wal-Mart's. How's that possible? One reason is that Costco workers feel valued, which adds enormously to their productivity, and they don't leave -- employee turnover is a tiny fraction of Wal-Mart's rapidly revolving door.

      In my  urlLink iTunes  here at home i've got a few songs on repeat tonight.    1.  Everything's Alright  - Charlie Hall (this song is great except it's almost impossible to find a recording of it.  Kind of has a  Toad the Wet Sprocket  sound...)    2.  Enigma Variations  - Edward Elgar (very regal sound and yet really emotive as well.  and so beautiful.)  3.  Above all Else  - Wendy O'Connell (Vineyard UK) (the chorus lyrics are "Above all else, above all else, above all else, give me yourself."  I think that says it all.)  4.  Here I am  - Emmylou Harris.  (I know I've  urlLink already written  about this song but it's so relevant and i need to hear God pursuing me right now in this season of my life.)  Lyrics :  I am standing by the river  I will be standing here forever  Tho you're on the other side My face you still can see  Why won't you look at me Here l am  I am searching thru the canyon It is your name that I am calling Tho you're so far away I know you hear my plea  Why won't you answer me  Here I am  I am in the blood of your heart  The breath of your lung  Why do you run for cover  You are from the dirt of the earth  And the kiss of my mouth  I have always been your lover  Here I am  I am the promise never broken  And my arms are ever open In this harbor calm and still  I will wait until  Until you come to me  Here I am

      read a  urlLink passage  today from Henri Nouwen's  urlLink The Genesee Diary  and it reminded me of John Elderedge's  urlLink Waking the Dead .  He talks about the fact that I am the Glory of God... walking around here on the Earth everyday. Obviously, all this is more than an insight, an idea, a way of seeing things. That is why it is a subject of mediation and not so much for study. But once you start  "realizing"  in this very intimate and personal way that you are indeed are the glory of God, then everything is different, then your life takes a decisive turn.  Then, for instance, your passions which seemed so real, more real than God, show their illusory nature to you and sort of dwindle away.

       MY LORD GOD, I have no idea where I am going. I do not see the road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where it will end. Nor do I really know myself, and the fact that I think that I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so. But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you. And I hope I have that desire in all that I am doing. I hope that I will never do anything apart from that desire. And I know that if I do this you will lead me by the right road though I may know nothing about it. Therefore will I trust you always though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death. I will not fear, for you are ever with me, and you will never leave me to face my perils alone. Thomas Merton  From  urlLink the Ooze Blog .

      well, i'm getting back to life again.   Things have been up and down but God's really spoken to me a lot.  I guess  urlLink Comet's  death was harder for me than i thought.  It's funny how God uses these times that we're vulnerable to really do deep stuff.    Just as I've been unsure about my heart and asking him about my future... I've gotten about 10 prophetic words from people telling me exactly what I've been asking God for.  They all keep saying things like "God wants you to step out," "Step into prophetic worship," "Dig into intimacy."    I have really been wanting a greater depth in my God-relationship...   urlLink Don Potter  really challenged me last Friday night about living in that most Holy and intimate place.  When my buddy Bill and I went out to dinner with him, everything he kept saying was something like "I've just dug right into God... I don't live for other people at all anymore... it's just Him." I waited patiently for the LORD to help me, and he turned to me and heard my cry. 2 He lifted me out of the pit of despair, out of the mud and the mire. He set my feet on solid ground and steadied me as I walked along. 3 He has given me a new song to sing, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see what he has done and be astounded. They will put their trust in the LORD. 4 Oh, the joys of those who trust the LORD, who have no confidence in the proud, or in those who worship idols. 5 O LORD my God, you have done many miracles for us. Your plans for us are too numerous to list. If I tried to recite all your wonderful deeds, I would never come to the end of them...  urlLink Psalms 40 .

       The familiar figure of Nelson Mandela, with his trade-mark floral shirt and ready smile, will be fading from the international limelight. The father of South Africa's democracy and icon of many across the globe has announced his intention to retreat from public life.  Speaking at a gathering of media and friends on June 1 in Johannesburg, Mandela said: "I'm turning 86 in a few weeks' time [July 18], and that is a longer life than most people are granted. "I have the added blessing of being in very good health, at least according to my doctors. I'm confident that nobody present here today will accuse me of selfishness if I ask to spend time, while I'm still in good heath, with my family, my friends, and also with myself."   He said he did not intend to hide away totally, but he missed the opportunity for reading, thinking, and quiet reflection and would now do these things and work on his memoirs. the  urlLink whole story

       Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up.   Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor.   You can safely assume that you've created God in your own image when it turns out that God hates all the same people you do.

      my puppy is dying.    Well, he's not a puppy any more.  Comet's 14 years old now and he's lived a healthy life; over the past six months, his health has rapidly declined.  It's been really hard.  I hate having to let him go, but I don't want him to suffer for another 6 months.  I don't want my last memories of my dog to be terrible.    Just this past weekend, there's been a lot of bleeding and we feel that it's time.  I'm really sad.   It looks like i'll be the one to take him into the vet tonight; then my grandfather has volunteered to bury Comet in some private land.    In all of this, God has spoken a lot to me.  I have peace with letting him go; there  is  a time for everything: to be born and to die.  I'm still processing... please pray if you can.  He's been a part of the family for 14 years... and he'll be missed.   urlLink      urlLink      urlLink      urlLink

       Our church service today was meaningful, and moving. I don't want that to get lost in this story. Our community of believers held each other tight, and shared our struggles.  The beginning of our service in particular was very hard.   Our friend, Barbara, is dying. Gordon announced that Barbara is now hospitalized. The sudden and rapid decline of her health has been very difficult on our entire congregation. It's been especially rough for Amy who feels that, due to her own health problems, she has not had an opportunity to be there for Barbara.   Today we prayed for peace for Barbara and for God to somehow grant us the ability to accept His apparent will.   Amy wept.   I asked for prayers of strength and healing for Amy and our good friend Cynthia held Amy close.   I shut my eyes holding back tears.   Gordon prayed aloud and walked over to where Amy and I sat to lay his hands upon us.   Unfortunately my giant mug of sweet tea was in the aisle at my feet and when Gordon came to us, his foot hit the mug and a measure of tea reminiscent of the Exxon Valdez oil spill gurgled out onto the floor of the sanctuary.  It was no big deal, most of the church members didn't notice, and those who did didn't care.   Our small community of faith is quite used to messy church...personally I think that's how church is supposed to be.   To his credit, Gordon didn't miss a beat. He kept reaching toward Amy and prepared to deliver more deep and heartfelt words of prayer.  However, he did take one brief moment to give me a quick glance and jokingly whisper, "Don't blog about this."  It made me smile and despite her tears I saw a slight smirk from Amy.  Honestly, I'm not sure I could have asked for a more immediate answer to prayer. for the rest of this really good story go  urlLink here .

       I wait quietly before God, for my salvation comes from him. He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress where I will never be shaken. So many enemies against one man – all of them trying to kill me. To them I'm just a broken-down wall or a tottering fence. They plan to topple me from my high position. They delight in telling lies about me. They are friendly to my face, but they curse me in their hearts.   Interlude   I wait quietly before God, for my hope is in him. He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress where I will not be shaken. My salvation and my honor come from God alone. He is my refuge, a rock where no enemy can reach me. O my people,  trust in him at all times.  Pour out your heart to him, for God is our refuge.   Interlude   From the greatest to the lowliest – all are nothing in his sight. If you weigh them on the scales, they are lighter than a puff of air. Don't try to get rich by extortion or robbery. And if your wealth increases, don't make it the center of your life. God has spoken plainly, and I have heard it many times: Power, O God, belongs to you; unfailing love, O Lord, is yours. Surely you judge all people according to what they have done.  urlLink Psalm 62  (NLT)

Hello, is it me you're looking for? 'Cause I wonder where you are And I wonder what you do Are you somewhere feeling lonely or is someone loving you? Tell me how to win your heart For I haven't got a clue But let me start by saying ... I love you  Yes, I know it's lame... but that's the song in my head today.
