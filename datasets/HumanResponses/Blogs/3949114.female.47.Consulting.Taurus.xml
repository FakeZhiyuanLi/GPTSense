      Howdy to all-  McFlurry Queen I love your insight. Yes choice is what we as humans are all about, we may not relize it, but we thrive on choice....that is why FREEDOM is so precious. (joke) Let's ask Martha in a few months!!!  &nbsp;  Ok, when I mention Oprah what do you think of (in the context of weight loss). Yep, I consider her the poster child of every diet, yoyo, binge and fad diet that has crossed all of our paths over the years.  &nbsp;  I will write about this in both of my ELetters, but I wanted to share this with all of you today...SHE GETS IT NOW!!! As a coach, a fellow dieter and life changed person her message is right on.  &nbsp;  I am going to give you one BIG SCOOP (like the kind you get a Cold Stone) on the key to all of this...WHAT IS THE GOAL ???? Let me know what you think the GOAL is, and we can kick it around. It will be the major focus of the next sessions of WHGL-Building Bridges to Relationships With Food.  &nbsp;  Keep on keeping on...and remember there is choice.

      Welcome to the coaching world of weight loss....I hope to give some insight on my experience in the area (I have lost 100+) over the past eight months...and the changes (other then the obvious) that I have experienced. I am also a Certified Comprehensive Coaching, who coaches others in areas of motivation, success and dream realization (weight loss, business, sports). I hope this area will be helpful to all of you and that you post freely any insights you may have to the success in weight loss, your experience in dealing with weight loss and how we can better understand...WHY and HOW.

      "If we listened to our intellect, we'd never have a love affair. We'd never have a friendship. We'd never go into business, because we'd be cynical. Well, that's nonsense. You've got to jump off cliffs all the time and build your wings on the way down." Ray Bradbury  Change is something we all struggle with O      What is it that holds us back O      Why can some change & adapt easily O      Why is it we are able to make changes in one area, but not others  “You cannot change your destination overnight, but you can change your direction”- Jim Rohn  FIVE BARRIERS TO CHANGE- O      Coasting in your comfort zone O      Apathy & indifference ( A NEW LIFE WELCOMES CHANGE) O      Fear- OR WHAT DO YOU FEAR (Rejection, failure, judgment, humiliation, success) O      Justifying your actions O      Putting things off  How many times have you heard “You NEED TO CHANGE YOUR WAYS”. You cannot illicit change in another unless they are open to that change.  WHY WE CHANGE- O      DESPERATION O      INSPIRATION  Desperation- THE WAKE UP CALL OF LIFE…YOU HAVE CANCER, YOU HAVE BLOCKED ARTIERIES, YOU LOST YOUR JOB, YOU LOST YOU PARTNER, YOU LOST YOUR FAITH.  INSPIRATION- THE JOY FILLED MOMENT- THE BREATH OF FRESH AIRE- You make a choice at change  GET REAL-MAKING THE CHANGE O      Are you authentic in your life, or do you want to play it safe behind your self-imposed limitations? O      Who are you, who do you think you should be? O      Where did the real you go? Your mask may deceive the outside world, but not your heart.    TAKE OFF YOUR MASK-  FIVE COMMON MASKS  O      APPROVAL SEEKER- Hard to celebrate you, when you are always wishing you were somebody else. Get in touch with your emotions, respect your feelings. Allow others to see you as you really are. Take care of YOURSELF first. Only then will you be available to others. O      VICTIM MASK- Could have Should have. Never seem to be capable of changing the perspective on life. Have a difficult time looking for inspiration O      BUSY BEE MASK- (WE ALL LIKE TO BE BUSY) the differentiation is as follows         A) Can you sit alone and do nothing?        B) If you stopped doing would you still feel worthy? Being busy is one thing, knowing what you are busy about is far more important.  O      INTELLECTUAL MASK- Detached and will use thinking and reason over any feelings that may be present or at the root of the cause. ALL THINGS CAN BE EXPLAINED AWAY and REASONED   O      RESCUER MASK- “Any time a cry for help goes out the rescuer will be in line”. Understand EVERY ACTION YOU TAKE IS MOTIVATED BY INTENTION AND PURPOSE. Next time you jump into the “LIFEGUARD MODE” ask yourself- DOES THIS PERSON NEED TO BE RESCUED, AND IS IT MY RESPONCIBILITY?  We can be a mixture of all of these, or you may find you are just one. What ever the case, they are blocks to change, and until you recognize them as such, change will be difficult and at times impossible to accomplish. Dig deep and find out what mask you wear and how it blocks you from your desires and goals.  PRESSURE vs. STREES- I use two examples in relation to this topic. One is the “COAL to DIAMOND” illustration A lump of coal (YOU, but I prefer to think of all of you as just ruff cut diamonds) when pressure is applied become a diamond. If STRESS is applied to the piece of coal is will break into small bits, but even the DIAMOND the hardest substance known under STREES, hit at the wrong point will CRACK and break into millions of pieces. PRESSURE BUILDS US makes us into BRILLANT DIAMONDS…STRESS causes us to lose our strength and the ability to hold it all together.  Use the PRESSURE in you life as a building of strength…ELIMINATE THE STRESS. LET GO OF THAT WHICH YOU CANNOT CONTROL…control what you can and feel comfortable in that process.

      More and more research is showing that people who have the personal guidance of a mentor or coach have a far greater chance of succeeding on their weight loss program than those people who try and go it alone. Three good reasons to back up what I say Reason one: I know exactly where you are at today. Otherwise you wouldn’t be reading this letter. Right? I weighed 345lbs at age 45. I suffered the same discrimination and humiliation that overweight people experience everyday. Reason two: I agree with you that when it comes to diets and weight loss programs it’s very hard to separate the hype from reality. The principles and techniques I use are not hype. They personally worked for me and continue to work for me today. Reason three: 130 lbs later (and still losing) I am proof of what anyone can achieve. Sure there are experts who know a lot more about the science of weight loss than I do. But most have never been there personally. I have walked in your shoes and continue to walk in those shoes today. Here is an outline of the benefits you get ·         Get step-by-step advice/coaching and ongoing support as you start your diet and weight loss program (and don’t forget – the program is also for you if you are already following a diet and you want to improve results) Take the stress out of experimenting with what does and doesn’t work ·         Discover the little known simple principles and techniques that people are using to lose weight successfully and keep their weight off (and its more than just a diet) Discover what’s working for these people, how it can work for you and why you may have been following the wrong principles all along ·         Get off to a fast start. Lose weight right from the beginning and keep losing No time wasted – maximize your efforts to lose weight most effectively ·         Research has shown that having person to person support and human interaction with others will increase your chances of succeeding You aren’t facing this alone. You have my support and the support of others in your group. You have the greatest chance of success no matter how many times you may not have succeeded in the past ·         We cover everything that you don’t get when you just sign up for a diet. No stone is left unturned! You get all the information. For example, you will even hear from someone who had a “tummy tuck” after they reached their goal weight. Was it worth it? What were the benefits? You ask the questions! ·         Sit in on exclusive interviews with visiting experts Find out all you need to know about making the most of your efforts and enjoying your new lifestyle to the utmost ·         Hear from “Success Stories” Have the opportunity to ask the people who have succeeded how they did it, what their biggest challenges are now, and how life has changed for them. “Success breeds Success” ·         Develop a network of “buddies” within your mentor group Turn to real live people for personal support and encouragement. ·         Learn simple, but unbelievably powerful ways to alter your thinking so that your dreams become achievable for you Its going to be up to you – but you will feel (maybe for the very first time) that you really can make your personal dream come true ·         Create a plan, manage your progress and develop a record and scorekeeping system Keep control, do the activity and watch the results take care of themselves ·         Get the low down on exercise – what’s hot and what’s not when it comes to weight loss Start feeling a whole lot better about yourself, enjoy the amazing benefits to your health and look great! ·         Discover the things that you need to start getting used to doing every day without even thinking about them.

Love what you have while pursuing what you want. Celebrate life starting today! ·         Be aware of the barriers to your success and how you can be sure that they don’t become roadblocks to your success Turn the biggest reasons why people fail on a diet into your greatest opportunity to succeed
