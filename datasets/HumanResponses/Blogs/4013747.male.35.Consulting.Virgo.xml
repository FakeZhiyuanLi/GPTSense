      I was horrified by an experience my 5 year old endured the other day. To begin, I taught my son how to play chess and he has gotten pretty good. He has honed his skills against me and a wonderful game called  urlLink Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster . I can no longer take for granted that I will thrash him and he no longer needs the chess board that has pieces that show which direction they can move. So, to explain the incident, he was playing chess with an adult who supposedly new the rules of chess, but hadn’t played in many years. They played for a while before they got into a violent disagreement about the rules. Does a pawn eat pieces diagonally or straight ahead? After being accused of cheating and being told by the adult that they wouldn’t play with him anymore if he was to continue cheating he broke down in tears and stormed out. All the other adults that were around couldn’t settle the dispute since none played chess. They conferred a while and noted that my son did have a habit to reinvent rules in other games to favor him. With this fact in hand they decided that he had to be cheating. So the consensus was that he must be guilty as charged. Not one person bothered to call someone or even look up the rules online to verify their decision. Much later after everyone had left, it was learned that yes pieces did eat other pieces diagonally and that my son knew what he was talking about it was to late to rectify the damage. This whole situation just shows that as adults we think we always no more than our children and use the little information we have available to us to jump to conclusions that have a lasting damage and effect. I know that I myself will no try to understand the facts before I draw any conclusions. At least I hope I will.

      A FRIEND AND CLIENT OF MINE WAS HAVING A BAD DAY.  THAT IN ITSELF IS NOTHING NEW, BUT IT LED TO HIM ANSWERING A SIMPLE EMAIL WITH MULTIPLE IMBEDDED QUESTIONS IN THE WRONG WAY.  WE WERE TRYING TO ASK HIM HOW WE SHOULD HANDLE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS SYSTEM AND HE RESPONDED IN A VERY SHORT MANNER AND WITH ANSWERS THAT DIDN’T QUITE MATCH THE QUESTIONS ASKED.  NORMALLY WE WOULD HAVE BRUSHED IT OFF BECAUSE OF THE STRONG RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE WITH HIM, BUT THIS RESPONSE HIT A NERVE ON OUR SIDE.  WE READ THE EMAIL AND STEWED NOT ONLY ON HIS MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE QUESTIONS ASKED, BUT THE SHORT TONE HE USED WHEN ANSWERING.  LET ME BE CLEAR, I LIKE THIS CLIENT AND THE LOYALTY WE MUTUALLY HAVE WITH EACH OTHER WASN’T RESONATING WELL IN THE EMAIL.  SO, ON OUR SIDE WE BROKE DOWN THE EMAIL TO FIND WHAT WAS BUGGING US.  IT WASN’T JUST THE SHORTNESS OR THE MISUNDEERSTANDING, BUT THAT HE WROTE ALL HIS RESPONSES IN ALL CAPS.  THIS SUBCONCIOUSLY LED US TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS SCREAMING AT US.  ONCE I REALIZED THIS I CALLED THE CLIENT ON THE PHONE TO TALK THROUGH THE ISSUES AND FOUND OUT THAT HE WASN’T ANGRY WITH US, JUST WAS IN A RUSH AND USED THE CAPS LOCK TO MAKE HIS COMMENTS MORE VISIBLE WITHIN THE EMAIL.  I LEARNED SOME VALUABLE LESSONS THROUGH THIS EMAIL.  THAT IN THIIS ELECTROINC AGE WE CAN MISREAD OR MISUNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF AN EMAIL.  THAT WE READ IN OUR OWN VALUES AND PERCEPTIONS THAT WE WOULD PICK UP THROUGH TONE OF VOICE OR THROUGH BODY GESTURES.  SO WHEN IN DOUBT, DON’T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT INTENT.  JUST GET ON THE PHONE OR MEET THAT PERSON FACE TO FACE.  THAT WAY THERE IS NO MISUNDERSTANDING.  I ALMOST FORGOT, DON’T USE ALL CAPS SINCE IT DOES INTONE SCREAMING AND LOOKS TERRIBLE TO READ.

           I didn’t think I would ever do something like this, but we did and it ended up being a fun day out for the family.  We went fishing at a, ugh, Trout Farm called Lake Julian.  With a 5 year old, a 2 year old, and a newborn we figured it would be a simple and quick experience that would keep everyone from being skunked.  What we didn’t count on was fish that were a little harder to catch if you didn’t know the secret to Lake Julian.  That secret, fish love fish food and ignore worms.  After hours of trying to coax many a fish onto a baited hook, we resorted to the $.25 trick.  We lowered an empty fish hook to the surface of the lake and then threw a handful of floating fish pellets right around it.  The ensuing frenzy for surface food induced an accidental bite onto the expose hook and a quick fight to pull them in.  So, a few minutes of renewed fishing produced 4 fish to take home.  For an extra $.50 the Lake Julian employees gut the fish so it was up to me to prepare them for our evening feast.  Never having prepared a fish for eating, we immediate called the in-laws for some advice.  They gave us words of wisdom, but maybe not of much use.  They said “when we have had trout in a restaurant it served bones and all”.  Well, that is a little to close to just slapping it on the plate as is so I lopped their heads, fins, and tails off and prepared a batter for frying.  After screwing up the batter, who new you coated the fish with oil and then dipped them into the bread crumbs, I finally finished cooking the food.  Now, trout are bony fish so we proceeded to eat caveman style making sure all the bones were out so that we would not have any choking kids.  All in all it was a good trip with satisfying results.  All except for the part where my 5 year old asked, “Do you think the fish felt pain?”  To which I calmly replied, not any more.

           How do I know that? Well that and few other things were learned over last Friday. My son, who is 5, was complaining of a pain of 10 out of 10 in his cheek. Upon examination of his mouth we realized that a piece of his tooth had broken off. He seemed to be handling the pain by the time we had talked to Dentist at 8 PM on Thursday so we resolved to wait until the morning to handle the issue. In the morning we found out that my dentist was on vacations so we reviewed our dental plan for available dentists “in network” and found a few that took children. Once we started calling for appointments we realized that a large percentage either didn’t work at all on Fridays or only worked until noon. Well, with a little luck, we found a dentist that would look at my son and evaluate the situation. He noted that a cavity caused the tooth to break and that he would need a  urlLink Pulpotomy  of tooth #S and then would need the tooth to be capped. Neither of which they or most dentists perform on children so I would have to find a Pedontist, Pediatric Dentist. So my first thought is, what is a Pulpotomy? My second is that only Dentists would number things with letters. My last is, here we go again, time to find a dentist, Pedontist, on a Friday.       So I call my insurance company to find a Pedontist that is in network only to have the insurance company tell me that I can look it up on the internet. I calmly tell them that while I am superdad, it is hard to look things up on the internet while sitting in the parking lot of the dentist. I informed them that if I had access to the internet I wouldn’t bother to call so it would be great if they could get me a list. Well, the answer is none, at least not any within 50 miles. Now, I do not live on the planet mars, I am in a suburb of Chicago. Nice insurance huh. I then revert to the old fashion way of doing things and page through the yellow pages to accomplish the task at hand. After calling every Pedontist in my city and surrounding cities, 7 total, I find, 1, yes that is a 1, Pedontist open and able to take my son in to do the work. So, while spending my afternoon at the Pedontists office having my son get the dental work done I realized, I should be a dentist so I could take Fridays off also.

      I actually have some advice for those would be managers out there.  Yes, they are a necessary evil, but they can be useful.  Here is my advice:  Gould Managers:      Set and manage the boundaries     Ensure quality     Enforce the rules     Run the project     Understand the business     Get their Hands Dirty     Listen, Listen, and Listen    Bad Managers:       Stop listening     Are inflexible     Deny risks and issues     Ignore or not understand the business or its needs     Don’t know or understand the people that work for them    Now, here is my advice to you leaders out there.  Not everyone can lead.  Some are born with it and others grow into it.  Good Leaders:      Live the vision     Actively include all in decisions     Are honest     Always have the end in mind     Listen, Listen, and Listen     Break Down roadblocks     Take the bullet for the team     Lead from the front     Put the team first     Know the team    Bad leaders:      Give the responsibility but no the authority     Circumvent the rules     Ignore the controls     Are secretive     Believe the ends justify the means     Don’t understand the motivations of the team    Ok, I have gotten this subject off my chest for now.  I believe it will resurface at some future date, but for today I am cleansed.

          My favorite Covey quote from  urlLink 7 habits  is “You can quickly grasp the important difference between the two if you envision a group of producers cutting their way through the jungle with machetes. They’re the producers, the problem solvers. They’re cutting through the undergrowth, clearing it out. The managers are behind them, sharpening their machetes, writing policy and producing manuals, holding muscle development programs, bringing in improved technologies and setting up working schedules and compensation programs for machete wielders. The leader is the one who climbs up the tallest tree, surveys the entire situation, and yells, ‘Wrong Jungle!’”  I once read that managers define the project, plan the work, manage the work, manage issues, manage scope, manage risks, manage communication, manage documentation, manage quality, and manage metrics. To that I say great, as long as they understand what they are managing. A manager that gets their hands dirty is worth their weight in gold. For the most part though it means that someone else is doing the work and they are just dotting the i and crossing the t in the project. They do no real work and add very little value. The worst types are the ones that I refer to as “Seagull” managers. These are ones that you never see around except for their occasional swoop in to remind everyone that they are there, to try to steal your food and then poop on everything before leaving.  Leaders on the other hand define strategy and goals, estimate the work, motivate the workers, resolve issues, lead by example, act on risks, openly communicate, teach others, develop trust, and achieve success. They can manage, but aren’t really managers. They can and will work, but aren’t workers. They are the glue that moves and organization forward and that the producers flock to. Just because someone has a fancy title, doesn’t make them a leader. After slugging it out in Consulting for the last 10 years I have seen plenty of “Seagull” managers and “Pretender” leaders. Let me qualify pretender leaders. They are the ones that rule by fear and by brandishing their titles. They have to shout “I am the boss” with everyone knowing that the answer is “no you are not”. They give all the responsibility to other while keeping all the authority so that they can stick it to you later. So what is my point? Lead, Follow, or get out of the way. Oh, and dodge the shit.

          As we head into the presidential election all my friends that are republicans sent me the site  urlLink www.demsextrememakeover.com  so that I would understand what a two faced turn coat Kerry is.    All my democratic friends want me to see Fahrenheit 9/11 to sway me to anti Bush he attacked   Iraq   for personal reasons side.    As far as I am concerned, they both are less than ideal candidates.    We are stuck with Bush as a candidate since he is the current president, but come on, Kerry?    How do we American’s keep putting candidates up there that do not represent the American people?    George, not the sharpest tool in the shed, Bush at least sticks to his guns and doesn’t waffle.    Both are of an American Aristocratic elite that really doesn’t understand how 99.99% of the rest of us live.    As far as my vote, I just don’t know.    I will vote, but I will vote conscience.    I will vote for the person who best represents my ideal which is small government, states rights, and no welfare.    I used to think that was republican, but now am no longer sure.    For any of you out there who haven’t seen  urlLink www.jibjab.com  it is a good laugh.        On a side note, What do you think about Barack Obama’s,   urlLink http://www.obamablog.com/index.php , run for the Illinois Senate seat?    That seems to be a candidate you can really like.    I was skeptical about him at first, but have grown to like his sharp wit and intellect.
