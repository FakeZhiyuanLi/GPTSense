       i went and saw anchorman with alix, ryan, and nathanial. it was fun. the movie was really funny and me and alix were cracking up. we laugh really loud!! ryan was alittle embarrased. but oh well... work sucked today. i really didn't want to be there. chrissy made me soo angry. i wanted to cry. i did. i felt alittle better. unfortunately i have to go back there tomorrow. i am really sick of floral right now. i only get 12 hours&nbsp;a week and chrissy gets like 20 and she doesn't do as much work as me. it's soo frusterating to know that i work harder and get less hours and paid the same amount as her. i guess vanassa is wanting to come back and if she does my hours will get cut even more. that is not gonna happen. i will be pissed!! so ya i guess im not in a good mood. im mad at my mom cuz she doesn't really spend much time with us. she's always at work. so i've just given up and am not going to even try to make time because she doesn't do that for us. watever...

       i feel like such a&nbsp;bad girlfriend. i was upset with jeff tonight and for a really dumb reason. we were at brice's house and he didn't talk to me at all and so i figured he didn't want to be around me so i left him alone. and it hurt my feelings. but then he thought i was mad at him. and i feel dumb for being upset just cuz he wasn't talking to me, but he's never done that before. and it was just weird and i thought i did something to make him not want to talk to me. plus i was having a crummy day. i feel like im starting to slip back toward where i was a couple months ago where nothing was good and i just didn't like anything. all the feelings i had then are coming back really strong. i just don't feel good enough or that im strong enough to deal with all the emotional problems my parents splitting has caused. i just want to be happy. and im just so angry at both of them for not making things work and for not being able to stay married. things have become so complicated. my dad is always angry and yells soo much, and i kinda blame my mom for that. because she's the reason he is so mad. and when i talk to her about it she says there's nothing she can do about it or acts like she doesn't care. and that makes me even more mad. i don't want to make things easy for her or dad and try soo hard to make it harder for them. i don't want to be this good kid that gives them no problems because they have given me soo many problems and i would kill to give them the same in return. idk.... i made a decision well kinda about wesley. i don't think im going back. they started setting up for vbs and didn't even try to get a hold of me. melissa was like well i don't have your number because it's unlisted well kerri and a whole bunch of other people in the church know how to get a hold of me, and they didn't call me. i don't like feeling that i don't belong there. and thats how i feel so i'm going to try and find somewhere else to go to church.    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***im supposed to get my car tomorrow night!!*** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      today was good. my dad, brother, and sister are in rockford so i have the house to myself. it's very nice. so after work i called my dad and he told me that if i have people over they have to be gone by midnight. so then later i called him like he said to tell him wat was happening. so i called to tell him who was coming over and he started yelling at me, and that he said no parties.&nbsp; okay so i have like 5 people over! and he said it was okay. then he was like you dont respect my house and dont pick up after your friends. but i do, and my friends dont even make a mess. and if we did i'd pick it up. it was my little brother and his friend who made a mess downstairs. so i got yelled at for him mess. that made me mad. but then he was like just make sure things get cleaned up.&nbsp; so i made sure and even cleaned extra!!! jeff was scaring me tonight. he couldn't breath that good and when he breathed it made these weird noises. he needs to go to the doctor. but it was nice being able to see him and hang out with him. that made me happy. well time to go!

      last night was good and bad. softball sucked cuz they team we played pissed me off. they thought they were "gangsta" but they were a team of white girls and it just wasnt working for them. and plus we lost the first game which we shouldn't have cuz nikki pitched good. our defense didnt make the plays, we didnt hit good, and the ump was sqeezing the strike zone like crazy. one a good note.&nbsp;me and jeff are better than ever. we talked last night about some stuff that i thought i was doing wrong, but it turns out i really wasnt. and so yeah it's good. and he's is an awesome boyfriend, and im gonna be selfish and keep him for a long time so no one else can have him. sorry ladies!! looks like ure outta luck, oh well. then we went to jewel to get stuff for my dad and then unfortnuately i had to take him home. it was sad i didnt want too. but i'll see him soon. IM GETTING A NEW CAR!!! i am soo excited. my dad found a 94 thunderbird for sale in lexington kentucky. and he put a deposit down and is going to finish paying for it and bring it home thrusday (tomorrow). its red and it has red interior. i think theres a cd player and if not we're gonna put the one in the jeep in there. so its gonna be pimp!! haha.. well adios...

       i dont like this losing&nbsp;stuff. it's getting really old. maybe it wouldnt be so bad if more than a handful of people cared that&nbsp;we lost. im so frusterated. tomorrow is another day though so hopefully we can manage a win or two. that would be a nice change of pace. as crappy as tonight was it was also good. i have a really awesome boyfriend. he came out to my game tonight and is coming out tomorrow too. isn't that sweet of him. my mom's coming to my game and i'm really excited because she hasn't been to one yet. it's gonna be cool!! i should go to sleep. i have a day ahead of me.

      ah.. i bought a skirt today! i wanted one so bad. i can't believe it. i've totally turned girly this summer. this has never happened to me. i used to never want to wear skirts. unless i was forced to, but now i bought one on my own, and i wore another skirt today just to wear one. oh well not much you can do. i guess it's not that bad of a thing. well since sunday there hasn't been any excitement. which is good. things have been calm and should remain so until next sunday when we go to my mom's for the week. i have a tourney this weekend. jeff said he'd come with me to my game tomorrow which is good cuz i dont want to drive up there by myself. especially when i dont know where im going for sure. saturday&nbsp;i have to drive up by myself but that'll be easier cuz i'll have an idea to where i am going. so yeah some guy named diego called me on my cell tonight and was like hi do u have a bf or whatever their called, and i was like yes i do why? he's all im calling on behalf of my friend who wants to know. i was like okay well now u know bye. and he was like do you want to know me? i was like not really bye. he sounded really weird. whatever. it was a pretty funny question. he told me who the kid was. me and alix went to walmart and while we were walking out these 3 mexicans walked past us and were like hey girls and me and alix didnt say anything and kept walking. i figured they'll get the pic that we're not interested. then they start whistling and growling at us so i turned around and was like shut up and dont act like that towards me. its disgusting! i wouldnt have said anything if they would have quite at the hey girls part. but no guy is gonna make noises like that towards me and get away with it. it was absolutely disgusting. they looked like they were in their late 20's or early 30's which made it 10 times worse. yucky....

      man my softball game but me in a good mood. we won both our games. and i was gunning people. it felt good. i picked a girl off, threw one out a second, and got a girl in a pickle but she was safe but kept her from getting home. she would have been out but the shortstop dropped the ball at thrid. it was a hard play i threw it alittle too late. my hitting sucked though. i dont know wat im doing wrong. it just wont all work at the same time. i got to catch both games too! it was fun. jeff came with, and it was nice. he's soo nice. i was glad he came. he really enjoys coming to my games. well i cant wait for tomorrow. it's going to be such a good day. just laying out and getting a tan! aww.. how nice. then maybe  i wont be so white that i glow.

      i hate my period! it is awful. i was at brice's house today and i just started balling for no reason. i dont want to be around people! me and alix have a day planned. we are going to go to my dads and lay out on the trampoline and get a tan then go for a run then go hangout with my grandma. i have to work at 4 but we'll have enough time to get all our stuff done. softball should be good. hopefully i dont have to sit out. that is soo boring. i hated it! it's not so bad when i get to bat, but when i dont even get to do that it sucks majorly. i need a girl day real bad. i need to hangout with ashley with NO boys around. that'll be the day. my dinner is ready and i need to wash my softball uni!!

      man oh man. sometimes i really hate being a girl. we get way too emotional. i can't stand it. i was having a really good night at tyler's tonight, but then i started thinking about alot of stuff and my mood just went way down. then i think i pissed jeff off on the way home cuz i wasnt talking. and he always puts his hand out the window and i always forget he does it, and i was cold and i accidentally smushed them. i didnt mean too, but he wasnt too happy after that on top of the fact that i wouldnt tell him wat was wrong. who knows. goodness! i need serious help people. i need a vacation away from everything...

      well since i cant get into my online diary at my moms house i figured id give this a try. thanks melissa. this way i can post comments on yours! well i am in a very good mood. we won both games of our double header (and jeff came with to watch) awe... wat a good boyfriend i have. then he came back to my moms with me and we ate dinner and watched the replay of the homerun derby and cuddled! it was fun. cuz i havent spent much quality time with him where we were just chillin enjoying eachothers company. he is such an amazing guy. ahh he makes me really happy, and he's soo nice to me. im floored.. he's wonderful. but on a bad note things with my parents arent doing as good as i thought. things were good and i thought the bad times were passed but sunday night (last night) my dad got so mad right before we left to go to my moms house, and for no reason to. so when me and eugene pull into my moms driveway she's on the phone with guess who... yup my dad. he's yelling at her and i guess he was like fuck you michelle and my mom said it back to him. then she was like this is crazy im done talking and hung up. so we get in the car and leave to go get mcdonalds. as were driving my dad passed us. he was on his way to my moms. he flipped a u-turn and followed us to mcdonalds. so were in the drive through trying to order our food when my dad gets out and starts screaming at my mom and saying every swear word imaginable. while im in the front seat and my 10 year old brother and an 8 year old boy my mom is watching is sitting in the backseat. my mom is like gene lets not do this in front of the kids but he wont listen. then he shuts off the car so we cant leave and pulls the keys out. it was awful. finally he leaves but threatens to hurt my mom. i was so scared. i hate when he gets like that. its really scary. my uncle said he would talk to my dad about how he acts. because my moms going to call the cops the next time he does something like that, and she's going to get a restraining order. there is no reason for him to act that way. i can understand that he's mad about the divorce but he's ruining our lives by acting that way. jeff's really good to talk to about this stuff because his parents are divorced and he's been through it all. i talked to him about it yesterday and he's so understanding and listened. man what did i do to deserve this.   if anyone reads this please pray for my friend leah and her family because her grandma just died... and for my family and the whole restraining order situation. thanks a million!!

       i got my cartilage pierced today. finally i got my mom to go with me (it sucks not being 18)!! but anyways that was fun. and i went out to eat for lunch with my dad. then there was work which was like being in hell. it was awful.  on top of what vicky left me to do i had customers coming in like crazy. this one customer is having us do this ugly ugly centerpiece for a 50th wedding anniversary and i tried to make it look better by making suggestions but no it had to be the way they wanted it, and it looks awful. but oo well nothing i can do about it. then i was like 10 minutes late clocking out cuz i had to wrap 3 dozen roses together for this one customer then wrap another dozen for another customer. the department looks awful. hopefully tomorrow vicky'll do all the processing and i'll get to fill ballons and clean the cooler cuz the cooler is soo nasty and really needs to be cleaned. and i love cleaning it out. it's like my favorite thing to do there. after work i went to brice's house and we had a fire. it was alot of fun. the guys were putting soda cans in the fire and watching them explode well one was buried in the coals so we couldn't see it, and we all sat back down by the fire and it exploded!! it scared the crap out of me. it was soo funny though.

      i dont know why this year i started getting so nervous around new people. i never used to have a problem with it. i think it's because i've done so much changing and am really not around any of the people i had been used to basically most of my life. i get sick to my stomach im so nervous. its so weird. and i want to be able to not be scared but i am. its so frusterating. i dont know wat to do. i feel bad cuz they're all jeffs friends and i know he wants me to not feel weird and i try but it just doesnt work that way. oo man what am i going to do.

      i want to cry. things are not very good. i think things are beginning to be like they used to be. me not liking people. lately i feel soo unconnected. like there isnt really anybody who i can talk to and who can understand me and the way i feel. im so scared for school to start. its so hard for me. i dont fit in there and i hate not having friends not having people to talk to.  who knows maybe this year will be better than last. i just need to find someone i can trust! and thats getting harder and harder.
