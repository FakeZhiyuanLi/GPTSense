      I'm on a crappy NTL tv package, no great shame in admiting this.&nbsp; I have this package because&nbsp;I refuse to buy the next package up for fifty quid just so&nbsp;I can watch an extra 10 channels.&nbsp; However, we do have MTV, which&nbsp;I though would be quite good as&nbsp;I do have a passing interest in some music (mostly classic rock and metal).&nbsp; However, i turn it on and it's a show called CRIBS.&nbsp; It's "Throught the Keyhole" without the guesswork basically, and the person taking you on a tour is the owner of the house.&nbsp; Two people who don't exist as far as I knew, who are somehow famous, except no-one knows who they are.&nbsp; Next up "Making the video", pretty self explanitory.&nbsp; Up next, MTV News, reporting about people who are not yet famous, and people we thought had died years ago.&nbsp; Next, More CRIBS, followed by "Newlyweds, the series." Big brother for the famous. &nbsp; For over seven hours i flicked back and forth hoping to find the one thing playing I got the channel for, Music!&nbsp; There was none to be had.&nbsp; I checked the TV listing on the net, and lo and behold, Music was to be played at 8am the following day.&nbsp; I double, and triple checked the listing, with no change.&nbsp; There was music on at 10pm that day, right in the middle of sky one's more bearable shows.&nbsp; I decided to try the 10pm music show, only to be appaled at the low quality of the actual music.&nbsp; Techno-club remix hour, followed by "The Osbournes". &nbsp; Two hours of music a day on a music TV channel.&nbsp; Un-shagging-believable! &nbsp; So now&nbsp;I am forced to find some way of getting VH-1 and VH-1 classic back.&nbsp; I hadn't actually watched MTV in over a year, so i didn't know what had happened, but it's all been religated to it's spin-off channels and the prime channel is nothing more than some shallow, pop-culture, trash pile.&nbsp; I mean come on, who realy want's to know what the contents of Julian Markhursts bread bin are?&nbsp; And more to the point, who the fuck is she?&nbsp; Anyone? &nbsp; Even MTV news has gone to the dogs.&nbsp; It used to bring tour-dates, cancelations, new gigs and music releases.&nbsp; Now?&nbsp; Madonna has stubbed her toe, and will be cancelling her european tour, also, Britney has a new man in her life! For twenty minutes, whilst tour information is religated to the website now, unless it's by someone realy populare, like Christina Agulera's body, plus whatever outfit she's wearing this minite. &nbsp; Have people become that shallow and vain now?&nbsp; Please, surely the human race hasen't devolved that much in two years.&nbsp; All the good stuff in now on channels costing almost twenty pounds a month for the 2 channels, which doesn't seem fair somehow.&nbsp; But then life isn't fair is it. &nbsp; Rest in peace MTV's soul, for the corporate trash have forever buried you.

      Imagine it's the twenty first century, mobile technology, cable and satelite communications, computer networks spreading across continents, and so forth.  I can talk to a complete asshole stranger across the world and tell him why his head is so attracted to his own rectum after the comment "But she's only a woman so her comment doesn't count!" and chat to a friend who i've not seen in almost 20 months (as he's in china) and even drop a few e-mails to a mate traveling across europe.  Imagine this upotia, this communication hevan.  What could possoble ruin it?  Try talking to someone in the same town as you using the same technologies as you would communicate to people around the globe, and you hit a bloody brick wall.  This is the weeks litany of hate, "Fucking Phones!"  I sent 16 sms messages to a pretty good mate of mine, sent him 3 e-mails and 5 message minders.  Result, he got 1 of them that i know about (received a delivery note) and no reply.  Sent 6 sms messages and an e-mail to another friend asking where we were meeting, result, we all stayed at home waiting for contact.  The broadband is working and the mobile is on, so why can no-body be reached?  The answere came as rather a shock.  Appartently, the sms service in my town is prone to outages during and after storms.  We had a storm about a fortnight ago, and they still havent sorted it?  So what about the e-mails? Due to technical difficulties by my e-mail provider, messages will be held in a que until the server has been upgraded.  Expected to be finnished on the 21st july. Thats over a fortnight away, and they started the work with out informing anyone.  Inspired internet management.  So what about the home phone option, surely someone would have answered? Nope! I've rang various people over the last week, and there all busy. doing something/one else and can't come to the phone, or are not there.  And yet i can get in contact with someone on the other side of the planet.  Does this make sence?  Personally, i'm a little pissed with all this, and the future loks to be even worse.  Contract renual time is coming up on mobiles soon and thats when numbers usually change too.  Ever get that deep dark sence of forboding?

      Well, need something a bit profound to start this Blog off so, here we go! Manchester, city of Lancashire, great hub of the north.  Shithole of england. I went today to pick up some gear for paintball, I needed some equipment to fix my gun and thought that the best place for it was in Manchester, as it's just down the road.  HA!  Mite as well ordered the damn stuff online, but i wanted to question someone about the gear I was purchasing.  So we set off, and spent two hours being bounced around the bloody city becasue a major roadworks was in place and had diverted the traffic almost 10 miles in both directions.  And here's another little kicker...  Manchester has very few main roads!  Yup, you read that right, it's mad up of THOUSANDS of little streets and alleyways.  And were does all the traffic have to go?  Down all these little streets because someone in the council decided that mid summer, after the biggest storm in the last 5 years has hit, is the best time to dig up all 7 main arteries to the city for maintenance and widening.  Bloody inspired!  How about building more roads through the goddamn eyesore first!  They could start by moving residents out of 3 main areas through the inner city, as 90% of the areas are vacant, and free up the damn space for roads and new industry lots.  I mean come on, i passed 3 industrial estates that were vacant and falling to bits, yet the council wont level them as its (and i quote) "Merely a shift in the ecomomic balance of the country.  Soon the balance will teeter back and industry will pour back into the city." well thats all fine and good, but those industrial estates have been abandoned since before I was born!  Somehow, I don't think they'll be filled any time soon.  Worse still, we finally get there, and the buggers have moved about 10 miles closer to the city centre.  Seems that no-one could get to them, so they moved last saturday, and hadn't bothered mentioning this when I phoned them on the Friday.  Anyone think someone was taking the piss a bit?  Anyway, have found another place to get the equipment, so i'm sodding manchester off as a source, and hope never to set foot in that cesspit again.  At least till the next time.  But today has been an eye-opener, if nothing else.  City planners have alot to answer for here in the north, especially when it comes to real-estate.  So while the city smothers itself in it's own car fumes, it's residents can sleep easy knowing that 50 year old, none existant industry has a home withing it's city limits.

      Well, lets see, where to begin.  A few weeks ago, my mum asked me about travelback to the UK for a little trip, only a week, before going back to Ireland.  Fair enough, i have no problems with this, although i wish there was more room here so she could bring my grandad as well, but money is tight as always and there's not enough room.  So, I make arrangements, plan things and all that.  Wednesday comes roud, and I receive a phone call, would I mind coming round this weekend and fix the modem, my brother will bring the parts round and I can take the ferry to see her.  This is a bloody 1,200 mile round trip, to fix a modem and stay for 2 nights.  I was going to argue the point, but was told that if they went to the local computer guy he was charging about 90 euro's for the fixing of the modem.  Fuck that, they can pay for my bloody ticket and i'd go over myself and fix it.  Things have gonna bad there since my boss closed his doors to business (12 grand still owed to him, and local busines'es not paying there bills on time for 10 years.  He's had enough and left).  He WAS the local computer guy, and charged quite cheaply for what we did.  But some people still want quality service for free, theiving bastards, and now we have a bloody con man running there IT.  Well, what could i do, my mum cancelled her trip, and we made plans for me to go over there.  Here's why it pissed me off!  Wednesday, get message, have to go upto the post office and collect the money for the ticket. Get to post office, the picture id i presented wasn't enough.  It was my provisional licence, the same shagging licence they processed for me a week before.  An hour waiting for the bus (again) meant thet once I got home, it would be way to late to return and colect it.  Whilst I was waiting for the phone call (that arrived at 4pm when I rang them),   I stepped into a local travel agent to ask about tickets and so forth, most helpful, or so I thought.  Thursday, Finally get the money order (Long que, glass walls, no air conditioning, Very hot day), I trooped down to the travel agents and asked to book the ticket.  "What package would you like?"  Package?  What were they on about!  I made further enquieries and found out they dont make National Express/Euro Lines bookings anymore.  They do the National Express/Eurolines package bus tours!  I specifically asked the airhead bloody agent about the ticket types they did and she told me, right to my face, that they booked them.  Not 20 hours have passed since this exchange, and now they dont according to the three of they that I asked!  Fucking wonderful.  I had to make a 6 mile trip into manchester to book the ticket with national express themselves.  I go home rather pissed off as I know that after 2 pm, getting a bus into manchester is an impossibility.  Well, not without killing someone it isn't.  Friday, last day to book for the weekend.  I get a lift off my dad (Look, just cos I can learn how to drive doesn't mean im confident to drive into Manchester.  Think New York city with only 1 lane in either direction), and in we go.  Twelv narrow misses and 1 padestrian almost mounted to the bonnet (wanker walked right out into heavy traffic that was moving) and we get to National Express.  I march into the que, get told I pushed in front of someone (she should have been talking on her cell phone and payed attention to the fact she was 6 feet from the nearest person) and managed to get to the counter in under 2 minutes (they like to get you out of there sight, wonderful system).  I get asked wher i'm going, what the specific destination is, what type of travel blah blah blah.  All goes into the computer, which is linked to Eurolines and Bus Eiran (Irish Busses).  The destination i selected does not exist.  We did a search for M, and down they scroll.  Not there, id have to get off in Limerick and board in Limerick, even though the place i want is 2 hours travel back up north (Limerick being in the far south), Fuck that!  I didn't argue the point, I just got it booked for Limerick and that was that.  The drivers wont give a shit, as long as I disembard and board somewhere.  Finally, after a week of stress, it's done and I got home, 20 car accident averted and 2 pedestrains still alive (the return trip was frought with pillocks as well).  Got a new case for my pc, got a processor on order, and some new ram (This pc is 4 years old, and was built from cheap parts.  The Motherboard was replaced after christmas, so this is just a natural progresion.) thats due soon.  All is well, and it will be nice to see my Mum and Grandad again.  I do miss em, and it's a pian that I have to do all sorts of stupid things just to go see them.  Whats next, sacrific a chicken to some pagan god before you can book at National Express?  I remember not too lang back it took a quick trip into a trvel agents to sort all this out at once, but thats now a myth, ever since Mr Turban decided to wage war on the west.  I'm suprised that haven hit China or Korea, places that needs that type of shake up..... makes me wonder sometimes, it realy does.  I travel on Monday, and am back Thursday.  If all goes well.  CoH Update:  Hagan, my magic healer/electrical caster is now almost lvl 20 (yay).  Took some doing seems how my BroadBand has been going offline for long periods.  Were getting a free upgrade, as they now have enough money to update the system, that and they got 1 million customers now.  So when maintenance starts, the lines go down.  Thi sis going to go on for the next 4 weeks were told, although work has progressed well.  Super Shooter, a mate of mine in the game is also coming along nicely, he hit lvl 19 yesterday, and may hit lvl 20 about the same time as me, hopefully tomorrow.  Were working hard at this as were trying to get to Hero status (lvl 20+) as we can then get capes (soon).  Also means we can get 2 uniforms, something they add as a progression status, which can be fun in it's own way.  You can also add more to your back story if you wish, as well as a journal function (look, it's a roleplay game, these things are important).  The only problem is the super group i'm in.  I like the group, but I apear to be the only person on during daylight (na dsome night time) hours, even at weekends.  This is annoying as i wanted to add some other players to the group, and I cant do it (the boos has been offline all week).  Gonna try tonight and see if I can catch him on, try and get the admin settings sorted out.   L8r Guys.

      Well, whats new with the misserable sod this wee then?  Suprisingly, not much...... until last night that is. Went to see I, Robot as i'm an Azimov fan I decided that it might not suck and actually be worthy of the mans vision.  It is!  Will Smiths overacting was actually needed for some of the bit's in the film (not giving anythig away, just go watch it).  The backdrop was spectaculare, the visuals stunning and the story, well, i'm very suprised someone could actually pull of an Azimov based story without his help, him being dead and all.  It's well thought out and planned, and it's a compelling storyline, it comes hightly recomended.  So, after watching such and excellent film (The last one i saw at the cinema being Charlies Angels 2, what a pill of shit!) what could possobly put me in such a miserable fucking mood?  Well, i had to take the bus there (5 passed by, all full) and it took me 30 mins of waiting till i finally got a ride.  But on the way back, things were going smoothly, until i got to the town centre.  I had to transfere to another bus, and i could be at home inside fifteen minutes.  A half an hour later, me and twelve other people were still waiting for the damn thing to arrive.  Considering that there should be one every 5 minutes, it was begining to ruin my day.  Almost an hour later, an alternative bus pulls up (goes NEAR to were i live) and i decide to catch that one and get home with a littl bit of a walk involved.  So, just t reiterate, 30 minutes spent waiting for a bus earlier in the day.  An hour in the evening, and it's not over yet.  We have areas of the town which are heavy traffic zones so no pedestrians are allowed to walk down them (too many accidents and a few deaths prompted this) and the bus is in the middle of one when it suddenly looses power.  We broke down.  And we couldn't get off either, as it was rush hour and we were boxed in.  We had to wait almost an hour till a replacement bus arrived, and then had to transfere whilst the police halted traffic.  Un-fucking-real.  I'm now traveling home on the SHORTEST route and it's taking me 2 hours.  If i'd known, i'd have walked, it would have only taken me 30 minutes.  It's now 2 and a half hours wasted traveling in humid heats on a vehicle thats mostly glass.  Yeah, I was just pissing peachy.  Bought a chippy meal (for our none english readers, I ordered takeaway food), and fucked off home to eat it.  Three fourteen year old girls tried soliciting me (thats a first, i can tell you) and I was told I was the scum of the earth by a passing drunk.  Considering all this, i should have stayed at the cinema and watched Garfield.  Instead, i decided to wait till monday to do that (yeah, like i got anything better to do).  In other news, I started playing City of Heros (CoH) a few weeks ago, and have decided to make my primary character my healer, called Hagan.  Been tricky trying to figure out what character to go for, but i decided to settle with him fr 2 reasons.  1) It's a support class, and i like playing them. 2) Healers tend to get more respect off of other players, and less harrasment (lets face it, would you piss you doctor off whilst you bleeding all over the floor?).  The bad side is your either always in demand, or you get everyone trying to get you into there supergroup.  I recently found out that no-one likes playing them, as they have shit defencive and offencive capabilities, and you have to spend so much on them to keep them safe.  Also, going solo is not a good idea.  Still, i got some friends who have got a Super Group up and running so ill join them, and carry on as normal, see where it all takes me.  Updates soon.
