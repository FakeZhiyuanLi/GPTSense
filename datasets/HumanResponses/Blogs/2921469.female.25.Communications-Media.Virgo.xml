      I didn't believe it was true. I guess now I have to. This is from a  urlLink Meier & Frank  ad in  urlLink The Oregonian . If you can't tell who it is, click on it to see a larger version.   urlLink     As a longtime member of  urlLink Netflix  (since November 2000 to be exact), I wasn't sure how to take this  urlLink news . But then I decided, like any good consumer, to sign up for the free trials at both  urlLink Walmart  and  urlLink Blockbuster .  I want to stay with Netflix because, hello? It came up with the idea. However, both Walmart and Blockbuster are charging less, now that Netflix went and raised its rates. We'll see how happy I am during my 30 days with Walmart and my two weeks with Blockbuster. At any rate, I clearly will be doing some seriously intense DVD watching for the next few weeks.

      These are just a few of the many many things that can drive me mad:   Saying "funnest" or "funner" (not words; say "most fun" or "more fun," please; thank you)  Writing your when you mean you're (or vice versa)  Mispronunciation of common words (example: Nolan says "REAL-UH-DUR" or "REAL-UH-TUR" instead of REALTOR; notice how there's nothing between the l and the t? Let's keep it that way)  Leaving the toilet seat up  Toilet paper that rolls from under instead of over (I change it, even in other people's houses; seriously, don't invite me over, I'm crazy)  Loading silverware into the dishwasher with the handles facing up (because, ew, the part you eat off of is down there where all of the food residue will fall)  Putting clothes away on top of the clothes that already are put away (I put T-shirts and the like on the bottom of the stack so that all of them get warn about equally; same with dishes).  Labels on my shower products facing inward so that I can't read them  People who talk (or tap their feet or cough or wheeze or laugh obnoxiously) at a movie theatre  Picky eaters  Snoring  Cigarette smoke coming into my house when my windows are open (smoke if you want to, but PLEASE don't do it outside my window)  People who listen to their head phones so loudly on the bus that I can not only hear music, I can hear words and discern what song they are listening to  When someone doesn't "get" the things I'm mad passionate crazy in love with (such as "Fight Club," The Beatles, "Arrested Development," "Queer as Folk," "The Amazing Race," Johnny Cash, "Ali," etc.)  The other way around (people who like the things I loathe, such as Jennifer Lopez/J. Lo, Mischa Barton, most pop music, many blockbuster movies, etc.)   OK, in all honesty, not all of those things will definitely make me hate you (in fact, many people I love love LOVE do those things). The truth is, if I start to love you, I'll look past anything. If I don't know/like you, however, watch out. Because I am picky.  Oh, and speaking of Mischa Barton (I was a little while ago in case you'd forgotten), TWoP's second segment of the  urlLink Tubey Awards  have so much Mischa Barton hate and "Scrubs" and "Arrested Development" love that I think they only counted my vote.

      Is this really what politics comes down to:  urlLink ketchup ? I must tell you that there is no one, no issue, nothing that will make me choose one bottle of ketchup over another. Politics is politics, but ketchup is ketchup. I believe in a separation of ketchup and state. Seriously, though, I find that weird. Although, proceeds go to scholarships, so I shouldn't complain.  And are you or have you ever been  urlLink tired ? That's just another weird but true story I couldn't resist sharing.  In my real life, I went out for a drink after work with my friend  urlLink Katie  and her friend Jessica. It was very fun. I hadn't seen Katie in ages (since the day of the  urlLink record-setting Portland snowstorm , also known as New Year's Day). It was great to see her, talk to her, laugh with her and just hear stories about her life. Who ever would have thought stories about Anchorage could be so fabulous? Well, I didn't. But they are.  Nolan is gone on a hunting trip with his dad and his two brothers, so I'm alone for however long they're gone (yes, that's all of the information I get, because they don't know when/if they're going to fill their tags). I've been so busy and I'm still so busy that the alone time isn't bothering me. Yet.  I will try to have a more exciting life or at least a little creativity next time. I promise.

      I'm not really sure what I'm doing here, but I thought I'd pass this along and see what happens. I got it from  urlLink Sarah . If you have a blog, feel free to do the same thing and let's see if it works:  There are by some estimates more than a million Web logs. But most of them get no visibility in search engines. Only a few "A-List" blogs get into the top search engine results for a given topic, while the majority of blogs just don’t get noticed. The reason is that the smaller blogs don’t have enough links pointing to them. But this posting could solve that. Let’s help the smaller blogs get more visibility!  This posting is  urlLink GoMeme 4.0 . It is part of an experiment to see if we can create a blog posting that helps thousands of blogs get higher rankings in Google. So far we have tried three earlier variations. Our first test,  urlLink GoMeme 1.0 , spread to nearly 740 blogs in 2.5 days. This new version is shorter, simpler, and fits more easily into your blog.  Why are we doing this? We want to help thousands of blogs get more visibility in Google and other search engines. How does it work? Just follow the instructions below to re-post this meme in your blog and add your URL to the end of the Path List below. As the meme spreads onwards from your blog, so will your URL. Later, when your blog is indexed by search engines, they will see the links pointing to your blog from all the downstream blogs that got this via you, which will cause them to rank your blog higher in search results. Everyone in the Path List below benefits in a similar way as this meme spreads. Try it!  Instructions: Just copy this entire post and paste it into your blog. Then add your URL to the end of the path list below, and pass it on! (Make sure you add your URL as live links or HTML code to the Path List below.)  Path List  1.  urlLink Minding the Planet   2.  urlLink When Knitting Was a Manly Art    3.  urlLink Sarah’s Homestead Blog    4.  urlLink DeAnn's blog   5. (Your URL goes here! But first, please copy this line and move it down to the next line for the next person).  (NOTE: Be sure you paste live links for the Path List or use HTML code.)

      Well, I arrived safe and sound back in Portland around 10 p.m. Sunday night after a few exhausting but very fun days. It was so wonderful to see how truly happy two of my dear friends are together. And, as usual with weddings, it was so nice to see so many people that I haven't seen or talked to in ages.  As the "Wedding Coordinator" (the wedding program even said "Wedding Coordinator: DeAnn Welker, high school friend of bride"), I must admit to still being thoroughly tired. So, not much posting for now. Don't give up, though. I promise I will be back soon. Before I go, though, I'll leave you with this funny wedding story:  Instead of a conventional slow dance for their first dance, Courtney and Waylon did a choreographed "performance" to "It had to be you," complete with top hat and cane. It was very cute and VERY Courtney! Now they're off dodging hurricanes in Jamaica, while I'm sitting here exhausted in front of my computer.  I'd love to write more, but my bed is calling me. If I didn't write enough for you, go read my  urlLink sister's new blog . She promises to actually update this one with some regularity.

      Sorry for the abbreviated post. I'm in Medford for the night, leaving early early (for me anyway) in the morning to head to Chico for  urlLink the wedding ! I'll give you details, and hopefully photos, when I return. Have a lovely weekend. What are your plans?

      Today I did something I generally try to avoid doing: I went to Starbucks. Well, technically, I went to Safeway and walked up to the Starbucks counter, but that's beside the point.  The point is the conversation I had with the barista, who not only wore a tag that said "Starbucks manager," but who also, at one point during our conversation, referred to himself as the manager. Pay attention to that. He is the manager! Of Starbucks. This will be important later. Write it down if you need to.  Me: So, what's different about the new  urlLink light frappuccinos ?  Starbucks manager: They are made with Splenda instead of sugar, so they have lower carbs, fewer calories and less fat.  Me: How do they have less fat?  SM: There's no sugar.  Me: That wouldn't change the amount of fat. Are they made with skim milk instead of regular?  SM: No. We don't put milk in them.  Me: They obviously have milk in them.  SM: We don't put the milk in them. We use a mix.  Me: So, what's in it?  SM pulls out a sheet of paper and reads: This says they have 60 percent less fat,  blah blah blah  fewer calories and  blah blah  fewer carbs. (I can't help it if I didn't pay attention to everything he said; that was a long sentence!)  Me: But how? What is in them?  SM: I don't know.  Me: You don't know!?  SM: No. We use a mix. We make it every morning, so it's fresh.  Me: It kind of disturbs me that you don't know what's in them.  SM: I don't think they want us to know.  (I have to interject here to ponder the mystery that is the FDA. Our groceries have to be labeled with what is in them down to the smallest ingredient, but if someone prepares your food/drink, they can serve you, say, cow's ass, and they wouldn't even necessarily KNOW what's in it, let alone have to tell you?)  Me: Well, they must use skim milk.  SM then pulls out a BOX (nothing screams freshness like mix in a box, does it?) that looks similar to a soy-milk box but says "Starbucks Light Frappucino," and reads: Yes, it says here that it has skim milk in it.  Me: OK, thanks. I'll take a tall light coffee frappuccino, please.  SM: That will be $475.25.  Me: Thanks!  The point? I'm really dumb. Despite all of the reasons NOT to buy one, I did it anyway. And it actually was pretty yummy!

      One of my book clubs has decided to read "Why Girls Are Weird" by  urlLink Pamela Ribon  for our next book. When I told Nolan the name of the book we're reading, he said, "That must be a really long book." Heh. Yep, that's my boyfriend ... making jokes at my (and all females') expense. I'm so very proud.  Did you know President Bush has a blog? No? Well, it has to be true. There's an article about it  urlLink right here . And don't forget to read the most important part:  urlLink the page grab from his blog . Seriously, go there. Whether you love Bush or hate him, it's VERY interesting! Among other things.  I watched  urlLink "The Village"  last Friday. Not sure how I feel about the movie as a whole. The acting was tremendous. And it was very well done. It just ... wasn't what I expected. And here I'm always arguing that expectations don't change my moviegoing experience. This time, they might have.  Now I'm mainly excited to see  urlLink "Garden State,"  and I'm also anticipating  urlLink "Collateral"  pretty greatly. Shut up. It's Michael Mann. The man is a genius.  Seriously, though, I don't know why I ever go to the movies. At least not without  urlLink these . Because people? They're just rude. I'm not talking about any of you, of course. Only all of the people in the world who DON'T read my blog.

      Well, here I am getting all fancy with a new blog look. You can feel free to tell me what you think, but I believe this one will be sticking around for quite some time. If you miss the old one, you can visit it  urlLink here , but I won't be updating it.  So, to get this started on a familiar note (about TV of course!), the Parents Television Council issued its  urlLink annual list  of the 10 best and worst TV shows for families. I certainly don't agree with their No. 1 pick for worst show. I sometimes think they try to choose something they know will be controversial just so that they'll get written about in the media. Anyway, they're wrong. Believe me, not them.
