      ok my god daughter died on wed.- im not sure how i  feel about that i guess its because i didn't know her - im relieved though because all i thought of was what kind of life would she lead if u can call it a life at all - she most likely would have never spoken or walked. she would not have a life - along with that i found out that my ex has a serious girlfriend he went away with her to i guess meet her family and i can honestly say that i hope that she is a good strong women she sounds nice over the phone { my ex and i  work together } i also hope that he is genuine with her - i want her love to change him for the better - he is soo used to using people that i have come to the conclusion that he doesn't know how to love or respect women- and i am not saying this because i am scorned - because if him i have learned how to step aside and see a situation from an outside position - but i have witnessed how he treats his daughters not answering their calls, leaving them on hold when they call the office for him - its a mess and completely disrespectful- those are your children - i look back now and i ask myself how in the hell could i have lost my self esteem and allowed him to treat me the way that he did - then when i step outside of that i can see that i have learned a lot from him i now know first hand how i want to be treated and what i deserve. if he could treat his daughters that way how could i ever expect him to treat me like a queen - i also think that i was too  young for him to respect me as a woman and as an equal= there is a 15 year age difference - his present girlfriend sounds as if she is in her 30's which makes me comfortable. we started having problems when i started to grow up and change - which led him to loose love for me - i cant help that it was out of my hands - i lost respect for him when i started to notice his cheating - he was getting loose with it- i heard the girls on the phone with him and he would still deny having female friends = as if i was that damn stupid = anyway i guess deep down there is some bitterness but i think that i am truly happy for him - i have been trying to get on with my life - trying to date and meet new guys - BUT IT IS SOOOOOOOO HARD - truly i know that i am not bad looking - i get complemented on a daily basis from many men and boys their ages and races range - and a few females both lesbian and straight - i have come to believe that it has a lot to do with feature placement, height and weight ratio and a certain look. i think that i have them all and i have a great personality - now i am noooooo beauty queen or super model im not saying that - i am saying that i am attractive but i would put my money on my personality and loyalty before i would ever drop a dime on my looks - i will be me forever and my looks will only fade - im a good person i know that - i have a health sense of self - im just ranting i like that fact that i don't know if people are reading this or not - i don't care - im not worried about typos, personal opinions, or constructive critics- i feel free to subject jump and just plain let it out. me

       i just got a phone call from one of my oldest friends mothers my friend Champ gave birth this past saturday may 23,2004 - her daughter Wynter was born via emergency C - section - her daughter was born  1 1/2 pounds, on sunday the under went a battery of tests to see if and how they can help her make it - the tests determined that she had bled on her brain and if she were to survive she may never walk or talk - on monday  another round of tests showed that the babies kidneys were not functioning properly either- i tried to go and see my friend on saturday to see the baby and show my support my i was not allowed in the hopsital because i did not have any valid ny state picture id - sunday i was i guess very selfish i just could not bring myself to see my friend in such a  state -  monday i heard that my future god daughter was seriously ill  - and i made up my mind to stop thinking just about me and think of my  friend-she is my oldest friend and she is going through some horrible ishh - i needed to show her my support of only for a few minutes - so monday after work i tracked across manhattan in a thunder storm  to the hospital -when i got there i had made sure i had enough id to open up a bank account and purchase some stocks - when i arrived on the 9th floor all the time preparing myself for the worst possible situation - i approached the receptionist and was told she was in her room - i felt hot and dizzy rounding the maze like interior of this hospital with hundreds of questions and short comforting saying should the occasion arise where i needed to be her backbone. as i got to her room i took a deep breath and entered the room only to find it empty - i returned to the receptionist and asked if she could call down to the NICU to see if she was there visiting my god daughter - she was not i was directed to the fathers waiting room were i waited for almost 2 hours - finally Champ arrived with her mom and step father - her face lit p upon seeing me which made me feel good - at least i could tell that my presence helped a little and that i had made the right decision in comming - her mom and step-dad had to leave soon after we met up - and me and Champ were alone - she told me about how 5 doctors had come into her room to attempt to talk her into pulling the plug on little Wynter- she said they were medicating her to a point where she felt nothing - she wanted her baby to live as did i - but deep down i knew that even if se did live what was going to happen to her what type or quality of life will she have. what would happen to Wynter shoud anything happen to Champ and her husband - as it is they are living in a shelter ( they are trying to get public housing ). well Champ continued to fill me in on whats been happening the last few days- she decided to have the baby baptized that morning just in case - which i agreed with - she also choose not to tell her husband (for he has already lost 2 other children -one of his ex girlfriends was shot to death when she was 8 month pregnant and the other child died of SIDS) she wanted to spare her husband the truth - but for how long i thought he deserves to know but it was not my place to tell her - i was there just to listen and try to comfort- Champ wanted me to see her soldier ( as she called Wynter) we left her room and decended down the elevator to the 8th floor - i was told in a stern almost snobbish manner to wash my hands and don a paper mache gown and not to touch anything - i just shrugged and did as i was told - when i first saw Wynter i was in awww i thought about my own son in my belly almost 8 years ago when i was 6 1/2 month pregnant - thinking is this what he looked like - she had this jet black spike hair and a uni brow -she was really light (her mom and dad are dark skinned) she was slightly larger than my hand - but boy was she beautiful - i was looking at her trying to imagine what she would look like in 3 months when she should have been born - i was praying to whoever is out there to please let her be ok - allow her the chance to be peacefull weather in life or in death - i was assuring Champ that it was in  gods hands that the hospital was doing everything that it could possibly to to help her but now its gods up to god - she needed to remember that god nevers hands people what they cant handle - well that was monday her we are and its thursday - Champ was released  from the hospital on Tues. and she told me that she would keep in touch considering that she was living in a shelter/hotel -( which is another story - her husband and their secret marriage) btu she had no phone and no way of allowing people to contact her - she promised to talk to me everyday and if she every needed anything that she would call me and tell me and i would provide or help her get what she needed / wanted. i tried to call the hospital to check up on my god daughter but i was denied any information because i was not a family member - i was givingvery little information other than she is stable - stable was still grave for her her kidneys needed to expell a certain amount of urine inorder to keep the toxcins at a normal level she needed an upgrade - well i have been praying for a solution a means to an  - well i just got the call that my god daughter passed away last night at 9:43 pm and her mom and dad have been missing since around midnight - Champ held her daughter for the first time after she died - she refused to give the baby up they allowed her to sit there for 2 hours - after she put her down she just left - im pretty worried - and angry - I hate not being able to help - i am a control freak to a certain extend i enjoy the comfort of knowing that i am a master of my surroundings to a certain extent  - i like being able to help the people that i love and care about - but in this case i am useless.

      please don't  answer this unless u actually work with that indescribable person - i work with him - the sound of his voice that past few weeks has been leaving me with homicidal feelings. it makes me sit up straight  and makes my face contort. no i am not  still in love with him - actually i dont even like him much - no i am not jealous that he has moved on - i dont like him for valid reasons that i have only just discovered after not being with him - it has taken me almost 6 years to understand that he is a user - he uses everything around him - he has no other avenues to employ he knows no other way.  i try to treat him like a stranger ( which for me is not hard at all ) i learned from the best him - in the years that i was with him i have just about perfected the art of self removal- i am able to shut down and turn my attention to other things in a matter of seconds. i treat him the way i would treat any other person on the street - i am friendly to a certain extent - i am able to joke around and even talk to him with normal tones. but deep down inside all i want to do is bash his head in - u see we work in a small office of only 6 people - everyone knows that we were a couple - so its not that bad. which can be good in a way  for me - i am known as the level headed one out of the two of us he takes on childish roles and tries to reverse blame onto me - he will ignore me when i ask him job related questions just because he knows that it will piss me off - i breath easily and try not to cuss him out - but hey im human - i DO snap - like today i asked a simple question and he refused to reply now ppl this question was not personal not stupid -not out of the ordinary -he was not   busy - he was not engrossed in a valid conversation - he was not reading he was actually standing directly in forms of me yet he refused to answer my question - finally i broke and told him to go f*ck himself - NOW he decides to answer me - not even my questions he states that i am acting my age . WTF .... i am so angry right now that i cant even breath. i am trying not to react but its getting harder and harder each passing day.  i am looking for another job i'm calling my job search that just for now search something just as the title says just for now -

      last night i went out to a club alone {granted i kinda new 2 people who were going to be there} but still about 12:30 am i decided that i needed to stop crying about not having a life and not being able to meet new people and get out of the house - so there i was sitting here and it dawned on me that i had been online for over 14 hours {wtf is that} i am a pretty girl,confident and funny and yet i am always home and always online - i am starting to believe that i am depressed - depressed is something that i refuse be - so i got into the shower and started to think about the pros and cons of going out alone = should i drink - that was the main thing on my mind and i decided i would not dress in my normal club attire {which is usually a skirt or dress and some killer heels}last night i wore a pair of blue jeans, a white long sleeved fitted t-shirt and a pair of 2 1/2 chocolate brown riding boots and of course i wore my pink pimp hat. i looked both casual and put together - it was a good lounging outfit - to me it told the people on the club that i wasnt worried about impressions or trying to snatch an man for the night. i hailed a cab from in from of my house and called my new friend Ray - Ray and his partner Big Mike promote this club - i met ray a few weeks ago when my friend Kim invited me to a male revue with some of her friends, they had had their tickets already and all i have to do was call this 800 number and obtain a ticket for myself. i called the number and Ray answered and was pretty cool, i respected him because he didnt seem to mind that i only wanted one ticket yet he  still wanted to know why only one - i told him that i had just broken up with my boyfriend and some of my girlfriends had already gotten their tickets and i had just decided to tag along with them - to make a long story short we kinda clicked nothing on a personal level but in the last i'd ay month or so we have spoken numerous times and have had some cool conversations -  like i said its nothing personal just on a friendship level- he calls to see whats up and if i'd like to go to his club {where ever he is promoting that night}i think he will eventually try to get with me but as of  right now its cool. anyway i called ray and i got his voicemail. i left a message telling him that i was in a cab on my way to the club and that i would call him when i got there. when i got infront of the club i was kinda nervous because i had called him a second and again i got the voicemail. this time my message said that i was about to enter the club and i was going to  stay awhile and if i didnt see him or big Mike i was going to go home. as soon as i entered the club Ray was playing cashier. all in all it was a cool night Ray had Big Mike get me my favorite drink a Apple Martini and he hung out. Ray seems to know that i am kinda interested in this whole club promotion thing. as i was watching him work the door i was impressed and weirded out by the types of lines that people try and give the cashier {as if their excuse for not wanting to pay full price to get in -is something new}. to me it was funny. Ray told me all of the gossip that was happening that night {it was the clubs last night of business} he told me that the  girl that they had working the door {as a cashier} last night robbed them of like 2 thousand dollars. he had said that she claimed that only 300 people showed up last night and i guess she kept the rest. the bouncers were talkin about robbing bottles of moet and the pictures off of the walls. around 2 am the bouncers started charging people outside to just come inside of the velevt ropes - then the same people had to pay the entrance fee  to get into the club itself. i was comfortable hanging with ray and big mike - towards the end of the night Ray had asked me to hold onto a  bookbag which i assumed carried his money and most likely a gun {to walk around new york city with thousands of dollars in cash- u will need a gun}- i enjoyed the view of the club that i was getting the backend that is - what regular customers do not get to see. Ray would count the money and pass it to me and i would stuff it into this bookbag, that went on for a few minutes, we then transfered the money to the kitchen of the club where i left Ray to count his money in private. i stood outside and enjoyed the music. when ray returned we went to the bar and popped a bottle of moet my favorite and tried to talk. it wasnt that late maybe around 3 am - but then i started to feel sick and hot - i guess i had too many drinks between the apple martinis and the glasses if moet. while at the bar  i had Ray laughing because i was being a neat freak {and that is soooo not me} but the female bartenders were not doing there jobs- the bartender gave us glasses that were just off the shelf and behind some bottles - i didnt know if they were clean or not and the bar itself was sopping wet- i had asked Ray to tell the bartender to at least rinse the glasses and i kept wiping down the bar. it was kinda funny i guess but i hate wet elbows. but that was me and i wasnt going to pretend to be someone else, i was there to relax and have fun. i wound up leaving around 3:30am i had had enough - i left it with ray that we are going to hang out again this weekend - hes cool and hes going to start promoting a new club in the city - he also invited me to   some black expo where he is going to be marketing budwiser stuff. i guess that i am going to go - he may be my ticket to some fun for this summer. i hope that we become friends  but i dont think that that is going to happen. hes a man and we need to build a foundation - i think he likes the fact that i am not a club going person and that i stay home alot - i think it makes him want to show me " his world" the club and lounge scene. im hopefull and im excite im glad that i went out - it proved to me that i am as confident as i think i am.  me
