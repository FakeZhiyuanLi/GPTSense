           Well, it's sometime in the wee hours of the morn and I'm beat.  I just got back from the Eighteen Visions, Midtown, and Lostprophets concert and I am sore.  I have a fracken shoe print on my shirt!  All the dudes from the bands were cool, they signed some stuff and talked to us.  I even met some scene sluts, ooh don't like scene sluts.  Crazy show, a lot of moshing, and yes I did get killed, I think I have a broken rib.  Finger Eleven is sometime soon and got to recoup in time for that one.  I'm going to pass out....later.

           Well folks, it's almost that time of the month.  July 17th, 2004 at 8:00 PM, Lostprophets are playing at Tremont.  I suggest everyone should go, unless I don't like you.  But I won't see you anyway so come if you want, make them money.  They are playing with Midtown and Eighteen Visions, bah, eh.  That's what you get for $15.00.  I recently shelled out $50.00 on an Usher ticket, this guy better juggle fire or something.      urlLink Click Here to Watch "Burn Burn" by Lostprophets

       Some say a picture is worth a thousand words, I say a picture is worth a thousand laughs.  Honestly, can someone be so stupid to post pictures in hopes of meeting "internet girls", knowing your enemies have access to them?  Let the flaming homosexuality begin....          I rest my case....Steve is a douche.

       I have determined that IMDb are racist.  They gave  Soul Plane  a 2 out of 10.  Watch a bunch of douche bags.  Let's kill them all, they didn't even feature any memorable quotes.  Come on Lil' Jon was in the movie, that should at least get it a 3 out of 10.  All right, just kidding, it was funny, but it sucked.   I got my schedule today...looks like I may have to work the first semester, but second 180 minutes straight of computers..  AP Calc AB 45 - Hoffman Spanish 3 45 - Simpson Networking 1 - James Chemistry - Godfrey English III Honors - Reeves  AP Calc AB 45 - Hoffman Spanish 3 45 - Simpson US History - Jones Network Engineering 2 - James E. Commerce I - Miller  Leave a comment or IM me if we have any classes together.  Time to watch  The Girl Next Door ...The DVD-Screeners have just been rolling in the last couple days.

       So I was sitting around thinking, "Let's switch blogs".  So I did.  Actually, Xanga just sucks ass.    You're so wise. You're like a miniature Buddha, covered with hair.    Ahh  Anchorman , to simply put it, one of the best movies this summer.  And I'm bored, that didn't take very long at all.  Before I depart, I leave you with something so hilarious you will piss your pants twice.   urlLink
