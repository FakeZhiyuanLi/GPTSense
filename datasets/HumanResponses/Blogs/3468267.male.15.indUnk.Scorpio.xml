      sigh... life is so cruel... yeah.... i studied for my papers... they were extremely easy... but now my major concern is shafiqah... it was so obvious she was trying to reject me in a certain way while i was chattng wif her... she saed 'watever the outcome, i hope this doesnt ruin our frendship' ... that was like the BIGGEST giveaway hint... so i knew that she was rejecting me... she was supposed to tell me her reply todae but she told me on msn last night that she couldnt... HOW conincidental... then todae in sch she was like so obviously ignoring me... she was supposed to walk past me... tat was her original motive... but once she saw me... she quikly rushed to the nearby stairs... i feel that she dusnt want to come to the fateful dae where she has to reject me rite in front of my face...but dude, i dun blame her...  i was so fuking hurt last night i actually teared... i never lost a tear for anithing... especially not for ani girl... but she jus made me cry... i was so damn delusional and hysterical i was like lying on my bed, staring at the ceiling... crying... sigh... wat a misery... well... life is a bytch... jus gotta live it...  anyway... i would like to thank faizal for his words of advice... i really do heed them... thanx man...

      I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand I wake in vain I dream of love as time runs through my hand  I dream of fire  Those dreams that tie two hearts that will never die And near the flames The shadows play in the shape of the man's desire  This desert rose Whose shadow bears the secret promise This desert flower No sweet perfume that would torture you more than this  And now she turns  This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams This fire burns I realize that nothing's as it seems  I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand I wake in vain I dream of love as time runs through my hand  I dream of rain I lift my gaze to empty skies above I close my eyes  The rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of love  I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand I wake in vain I dream of love as time runs through my hand  Sweet desert rose Whose shadow bears the secret promise This desert flower No sweet perfume that would torture you more than this  Sweet desert rose This memory of hidden hearts and souls This desert flower  This rare perfurme is the sweet intoxication of love  this is the lyrics of a song sung by sting... it is called desert rose... veri beautiful aint it? aniways... i really dunno wat is going on i sch now... am i ignoring shafiqah or is shw ignoring me? i dunt noe no more... whenever i see i her i feel like i wanna tok to her... yet sumthing is holding me back... i hv toked to her before... but why the weight on me?... could it be of the rejection that dae? i cant forget that dae... neither can i forget her.................................................................    aniways, sorry for not blogging for quite some time... veri busy studying... bloody black out last nite.. chem paper today was a killer.... gonna study sumore... and i still hav tamil oral tommorw... so i might be blogging less often... but that wont stop me  from blogging! chow!

      William Shakespeare (1564–1616).  The Oxford Shakespeare: Poems.  1914.   Sonnet XVIII.   Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? ~ Shakespeare  SHALL I compare thee to a summer’s day?    Thou art more lovely and more temperate:    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,    And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:    Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,            And often is his gold complexion dimm’d;    And every fair from fair sometime declines,    By chance, or nature’s changing course untrimm’d;    But thy eternal summer shall not fade,    Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,    Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,    When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st;    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.     this is a really beautiful love poem written by  will.i.am shake.a.spear .... it is really how i feel abt shafiqah... u noe wat i am saeing? aniway, todae was the last day at camp todae, and my ass is in a cramp... i got reAlly bullied todae, sigh, my life story.... WAHAHAhA!... no lah.. jus kidding... onli think everyone jus pick on me... hehe... got to noe alot of sec1s todae... they aint that bad at all.. hehe.. it was a fun camp lah... i even got to jump out of a window... kinda scary, but i managed... and here is another poem which describes me aswell...  The Road Not Taken ~ Robert Frost       TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood,   And sorry I could not travel both   And be one traveler, long I stood   And looked down one as far as I could   To where it bent in the undergrowth;              Then took the other, as just as fair,   And having perhaps the better claim,   Because it was grassy and wanted wear;   Though as for that the passing there   Had worn them really about the same,              And both that morning equally lay   In leaves no step had trodden black.   Oh, I kept the first for another day!   Yet knowing how way leads on to way,   I doubted if I should ever come back.              I shall be telling this with a sigh   Somewhere ages and ages hence:   Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—   I took the one less traveled by,   And that has made all the difference.             OK LAH.. damn tired... go and sleep... nitez

      yesterdae du art until nearly die... then, guess wat? i had only completed my first plate... damn... the misery... okok... i was thinking today wif sum frens of mine on wat to get shafiqah for her bday... i noe it is kinda far away but i need to plan and safe sum cash, see? so, they were like sum girly stuff and all that then i was thinking abt sumthing that she might be able to use... maybe a handphone? tat would be  a thing that she would use... cos it has been long since she had one.... i think the last time i saw her wif one was in sec2? dunno... but where the hell am i gonna get money for a fone? nobody was gonna share... and they  suggested abt givin her a second hand fone or a colorless one... like nokia 3310 or 2100... i dunno man..... shud i? i will jus sav up till tat dae and think abt  a few daes before her bdae... many of my frens are not veri successful in their love rite now... jus like me... so here is the advice... DONT GO AFTER UR TARGETS NOW... DO UR 'O'S WELL AND HELP THEM BY ALLOWING THEM TO DU THEIR 'O'S WELL BY NOT GIVING THEM PRESSURE... AFTER THE 'O'S THOSE GALS MIGHT CONSIDER... AND I SAED MIGHT! but in my case i noe that it is never gonna work out... yet why du u du so much for her tern poh asked me... i saed i feel that she is wif me even when she isnt... the first cut is always the deepest... she was the first cut in my heart, she wasnt like the others... she has the deepest impression in my heart... so huever she may be wif... i will always be there for her... if not as a lover, then as a fren...  so... and i am really pressured by the exams,.... sigh... so tired... so stress... no one to tok to... only source of relieving my tension is jamming my fingertips on these keys sending words on the net so that ppl can read how i feel... sigh... i wanna go and sleep... but got tuition... aiya.... go do homework... byez

AMY LEE  I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away I keep your photograph; I know it serves me well I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open And I don’t feel like I am strong enough ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel light when you’re gone away  The worst is over now and we can breathe again I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away There’s so much left to learn, and no one left to fight I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open  And I don’t feel like I am strong enough ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open And I don’t feel like I am strong enough ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel light when you’re gone away  IF U DUDES/DUDETTES WANT THE SONG PLS CONTACT ME... I WILL SEND IT TO U...

      yesterday, i heard from wq that aloy and  shafiqah were going steady... i did not believe it..... aloy? so i messaged him to get the same answer... yes,they were going steady.... i could not fuking believe it..... not becos she went steady wif aloy, but rather that he did not tell me... i never knew he liked her... i nvr knew...  today i toked to him.. he saed to me yesterday that he did not tell me tat they were going steady becos he did not want to break our friendship.... but guess wat, when we were toking some time ago, i told him that if the person going steady wif shafiqah was my fren, i would like him to tell me, i shuld be the first person to noe... but today, i was proven wrong... tat my frenship was equivalant to nothing... i was just a nobody, and i still am... i am just one of the dudes who come and go in aniones life... i dunt make and impression... not even a bad one.... i am so forgettable... of course, if ur stead were to be shafiqah, yeah, u wouldnt giv a shit abt the world.... haha... so after his explanation, i congratulated him... cos she found sumone better than me... my money could not buy her love... so most probably it would be my looks... i aint that handsome... but i aint ugly...as i saed, i am forgettable... but the fact that i was literally holding back my tears when i congratulated him really was weird... never felt so much pain in my life... never...  staying wif her in the same class and not toking to her is the biggest fuking thing in the world... i dun noe how much longer can i take this animore... she jus looks more beautiful everyday... but i  dun think it is rite for me to tok abt her animore since she is attached to someone else... my misery... betrayed, abandoned, not loved, i couldnt get to ani deeper misery can i? wahahaha... my life is such a joke.... i am writing all of this in the web cos this is the onli place i can express my tru feelings... not to my frens, to my family ... to no one... i could not sleep last nite that i took 5 pandol extras for the pain... but it didnt work... wahahahahaha.... life goes on..... hope she is happy, thats all that i want... tats all i could giv her.... but she would never be with me.... it is obvious to everyone, yet, i still make up that tiny hope and act oblivious... well, those dreams are shattered... dont u think? hahaha...
