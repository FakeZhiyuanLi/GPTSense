      This is a two-series books by  Helen Fielding . It tells a story about a British woman in search of...love? Well, basically it's about a journey most women has to get through in her life. The first book tells a story of Bridget falling in love with her boss, Daniel Cleaver, and gets involved with him. Later on, she finds out that he's actually already engaged to an American woman. Daniel isn't the only man in her life, there is also the lovable Mr. Darcy, who at first doesn't seems too lovable. They first meet at a family gathering, giving each other the wrong impression. But as time goes by (and as Daniel breaks her heart), she finds something she's been looking for in Mr. Darcy. I love this book. It's sooo girl power, in a simple sense. I learn a lot from this book, because Bridget is so down to earth and just like average women. I'm still reading the second books, called  The Edge of Reason . But so far, the story is about Bridget and Mr. Darcy's relationship. The first is already turned into a movie with the same title, staring Renee Zellweger as Bridget, Hugh Grant as Daniel, and Coling Firth as Mr. Darcy. The second one...still 'in talk' status, but already listed as 'upcoming'.

      This week featured cafe is  Black Coffibar . This cafe (or coffee bar like its' name) is actually sponsored by a cigarette brand. It's located at two malls, one is on the main artery street, Jalan Dago at  Plaza Dago . The other location is at  Bandung Trade Center , ground floor, just beside the south entrance of the mall. This is the one I went to just yesterday.    Interior Design   Overall, the place itself is a comfortable place, suitable for an afternoon breeze or a fast lunch. I don't know how the one at Plaza Dago looks like, but I assume it's quite similar. Some of the tables are quite unique. They are made from wood and on the center has this glass pane, underneath are coffee beans. The color scheme is...well, black! With a touch of brown from the wood. Not exactly my favorite color scheme, but still attractive.    The Menu, Please   The cafe serves...coffees, of course! All kinds of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, etc. I chose a  Black Mint Coffee , which taste excellent! Then for the meal, I choose  American Pancake , which also delicious! Other personal recommendations are  Sunrise Crepes , crepes with orange filling and sauce; and  Tuna Sandwich , loves those tuna salads! The menu lists coffee (hot and cold), sandwiches, pancakes, pastas, fajitas, and snacks. The price range is between 7,500 to 30,000 (in Rupiahs). Pretty expensive, especially if you only want to unwind and have coffee, but believe me...the price is worth it!

      This is the twisted fairy tale of an ogre named  Shrek  (voice  urlLink Mike Meyers ). The movie tells a story of an ogre who suddenly looses his beloved swamp to a bunchful of fairy tale characters. To get his home back without any interference, he confronts  Lord Farquaad  (voice  urlLink John Lithgow ), the short, cruel, self-absorb prince who really wants to be a king. Lord Farquad then cuts him a deal, if Shrek could bring him  Princess Fiona  (voice  urlLink Cameron Diaz ), who is captured in a tower with a dragon guarding it, then he gets him swamp back. Shrek then goes the rescue with a donkey,  Donkey  (voice  urlLink Eddie Murphy ), who he saved previously from the clutches of Farquaad's army. So...to cut the whole thing short, along the way, Shrek finds friendship and love. I really love this movie, which is based on a book with the same title. This is not the common fairy tale read to you for bedtime stories. This is twisted (in a good way) and pretty much in touch with reality. My favorite bit is when Princess Fiona says she supposed to be beautiful - she's an ogre now (a curse is involve in it), Shrek replies "But you are beautiful". Awwwww, it just melts my heart. Now if I could just find a man who would say that to me.    Link    urlLink Official site - http://www.shrek.com  Does it need description? It's the official site.

      Another romantic comedies! Yeah, yeah...I confess. I'm totally love romantic comedies. It's the most entertaining genre ever. And no...not every romantic comedies are enjoyable. Believe me, I've came across some that's not into the category of enjoyable. Anyhoo, let's talk about the movie.  I saw  Lucky 7  on  urlLink Cinemax  just yesterday. I actually made some plan to watch it when I saw the synopses, because it sounds good. But I didn't watch it until yesterday, when I accidently flip around the channels and came across the movie.    The Story    Lucky 7  tells the story of Amy Myer ( urlLink Kimberly Williams ), a lawyer from Seattle. Amy's mom ( urlLink Gail O'Grady ) dies when she was 7. Before she dies, she left some kind of timeline (schedules, rules, bla bla bla, based on time). One of them is how to find the perfect husband. The rules (or guidelines) goes like this: the perfect man for perfect husband is lucky boyfriend number 7 (hence the title). From watching the movie, I found out that to determine wether he is a boyfriend or not is when the man announces that Amy is his girlfriend. One day, Amy meets this gorgeous and handsome man (so the synopses says) named Daniel ( urlLink Brad Rowe ) at a bagel store. Daniel is a handsome, succesful, and somewhat to be ideal man. But the glitch is...he's only boyfriend number 6. So...Amy cooks up a scheme to make Daniel the lucky number 7. Fortunately for Amy, she has found the pseudo-number-six man. His name is Peter Connor ( urlLink Patrick Dempsey ), the man who work at the bagel store. Also fortunately for Amy, Peter also has a scheme. He was invited by his old friend to their wedding. And...he needs a pseudo girlfriend to prove to his golddigging ex that he's over her. So they goes to the wedding and pretend they are happy couple. But here's where the problem starts...they actually fall in love. So...will Amy follows her heart or her mother timeline? Well, guess. Nah, just kidding. The movie ends with happy note (you know what I mean).    The Review   I just like this movie. It's a remake of an old classic (or so say the  urlLink Cinemax  site). It's also a very enjoyable romantic comedy. I would give it a B+ (the plus is for  urlLink Patrick Dempsey  - he's totally cute in it, not like when he plays the NYC mayor's son in  urlLink  Sweet Home Alabama  . Totally better).

      Just like the name,  Kapulaga  is a restaurant and also a cafe.  Kapulaga  is located at Jalan Teuku Umar number 6, Bandung. The building used to be a house. It is very obvious if you see architeture (forgive the mispelling), also the neighbourhood surrounding  Kapulaga . It also can be seen from the separation inside.  As you walk inside, there's a dining area on the terrace with several tables providing seats for three each table. Perfect for dining on a sunny weather. Not recommended on rainy day though, you might get wet. Inside, there's another three dining area, separated by big open door and awning. The last and the deepest dining area has a few tables with booth-like couch, instead of chairs. Another dining area is outside, just left of the terrace dining area. It's also perfect for dining on a sunny weather. Not recommended on rainy day, although each table has their own big umbrella. Overall, the atmosphere is cozy and homy, very good for lounging or dining with friends.  The menu combines Western food and Eastern food. There's a list of pasta and steaks, also salad and soups for appetizer. But  Kapulaga  also provide a list of Oriental and traditional food for appetizer and main course.  Kapulaga  also sells alcoholic beverages here, mostly wine. The wine ranges from 39.000 rupiahs to 200.000-ish. But for those who doesn't drink alcohol, there's also non-alcoholic drinks like  Lemon Tea  (my personal favorite); coffee e.g.  Cappucino ,  Caffe Latte , etc; also fruit smoothies. My personal recommendation is  Pattaya Chicken Steak , which is chicken steak with sweet chilli sauce, a mix of west and east taste. Another is the  Chicken Salad , broiled chicken with cuts of potato and apple, covered in mayo. One thing to be remember is that the main course a big portion, so make sure you're ready to finish it all up or share it.

      Thus the third time Harry Potter back in action! But this time dear Harry got it a bit darker and a bit more interesting, I must say. And for you teens out there, our Harry ( urlLink Daniel Radcliffe ) has become quite a hunky guy alongside with his best mates, Hermione ( urlLink Emma Watson  - with not-so-bushy-now hair) and Ron ( urlLink Rupert Grint ). Enjoy the guys and drool!!  Having blowing out his nice-in-a-very-sadistic way aunt Marge out of the Dursley's house, Harry storms off to another year in Hogwarts. That means another adventure and probably another encounter with Lord Voldemort. But not this time. This time Harry only has to encounter a psycho killer who's a follower of Voldemort. Not only that, but also a horde of dementors (which is a thing who guards Azkaban) in pursuit of the psycho known as Sirius Black ( urlLink Gary Oldman ). Hogwarts also has a lot more surprises in this movie. The big and sensitive Hagrid becomes one of the professors and yep, you guessed it, another Defense Against The Dark Art (sp?)'s professor. So what else is new? The Famous Marauder's Map. What does it look like? Well..don'cha have to find it out yourself? ;)  This third installment of the Harry Potter series gives me (or us) a refreshed view of Harry Potter. Being directed by  urlLink Alfonso Cuaron  ( urlLink Y Tu Mama Tambien ,  urlLink Great Expectations ), the world of Harry Potter turns unexpectedly dark and serious - unlike the previous movies. We can also see that the characters really do grow naturally physically and psychologically. The costumes and the settings also support the movie in a beautiful way. We can see the complete landscape of Hogwarts such as the path leading to Hagrid's hut.  On the other hand, although it doesn't take time as long as the previous two movies, Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban doesn't satisfy enough. The Prisoner (of Azkaban) only visualizes the book, which is of course has more complete explanations. For you out there who doesn't read the book (which is a pity and also impossible because almost every person reads Harry Potter), I suggest..yeah..read the book. I'm also disappointed with the way the characters express their sadness. At one time when Harry was mourning the fact that Black is his godfather, I didn't catch if he was crying or not. He sounds like crying, but I didn't see any tear or anything similar to that.  Personal Pick: - Check out the Weasley's twins, Fred ( urlLink James Phelps ) and George Weasley ( urlLink Oliver Phelps )! They've grown their hair in that famous British style which I like so much. I even search the actors in the Net! - Funkier Albus Dumbledore ( urlLink Micheal Gambon ). With all due respect to the late Dumbledore, our new headmaster of Hogwarts plays his part really good. If I were to choose my high school's principal, I would choose him.  That's all from me. Since this is my first time ever writing a review, I really appreciate all the suggestions and all the critics. =) Until then.. Mischief managed! *poof*   Links    urlLink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Official Site     urlLink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - IMDb.com

      New look? Hmm, I'll think about it.  We've got announcement to make. As it today, the blog will be called  Double Mocha Latte . With the addition of my darling little sister...wait, my darling sister, we think the blog need a facelift...well, a title-lift...wait...oh whatever. Since my sis will also doing some posting, the range of subjects we're going to review is wider. My sis, the self-proclaimed curly haired rock chick, is totally into music. She will doing some album reviews, among other things. Hopefully this would fill in the blog (since I haven't doing any updating for a while now). Enjoy!

      *phew* What a week!!! I've been loosing my sleep lately. The local TV station is airing  Band of Brothers , 5 days in a row, since Monday. They air it every night on 10 pm, which lasted about 2,5 hours (the original series's duration is 2 hours, here is + 30 mins commercials). *yawn* I'm soooooo sleepy.  Anyway, I'm just gonna say what a coincidence. They air  Band of Brothers  about a week before the  Dreamcatcher  release. See? What a coincidence. Hopefully, this will make people flock to the theatre and watch the movie.  Aww, man. I feel awful. This is what I get if I had a weird dream last night. But I can't even remembered it. Aaaaaaaaargh!!! At least, I got to see  John Vause  again this morning. He's still in Basra, reporting on the pumping of crude oil there. Gooosh, *yawn* sleepy, sleepy, sleeepy. Maybe I should get more sleep.

      Aaaaaaaaaaa!!! Bugger!! The Internet Explorer just suddenly decided that I'm the enemy. Yuch! I was ready to pour my guts (and my heart) but it just shut. So here we go again.  After a few days missing, John Vause finally reported again. Still from Nasiriya, he reported about the Iraqi doctors that help one the POWs, Jessica Lynch. Looked good in blue shirts and (maybe) a grey pants, he talked with the doctors and was shown the room where Jessica Lynch was found. He listened very carefully to the resident doctor. Hmmm, very thoughtful of him. Makes him even more...aw, I won't even write it. *blush*  Good news (for me). I have bought The Forsyte Saga VHS set from the  urlLink Amazon . Bought through the used & new feature. Got meself a new one for only $42, while the one at  urlLink Amazon  is $71. Quite a bargain, eh?  Gosh, I am still sleepy. I had to wake up at 5.30 this morning, because I gotta do Mom a favor. I'll take a nap after this.  I just finished a book called "Confession of A Shopaholic". It tells a story about a shopaholic, who has trouble keeping her money or credit cards to stay in her wallet. While I was reading it, I keep thinking 'this woman is stupid', or 'can anybody be this stupid?', or 'oh my gosh, this woman is totally obsessed'. I just can't believe that anyone actually can get fired because she was hooked with a zebra-textured jeans (which I think definetely not worth the ordeal) and wouldn't let a costumer in the store she worked in to buy it (she hid it behind a curtain). As I read through the chapters, I kept feeling really annoyed by her. At that time, I wished I could just jump into the book, shook her, slap her, or do whatever it takes to get her mind work. But as I told my sister the story in the morning, she said "But that's how all shopaholic are". Oooooooooooh. Big 'round of applause for my sis. She's 5 years younger than me, but she can be wiser sometimes. Cheers sis!  Now, after reading that book, I moved on to "Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps". This books is very interesting, as it stated that men and women are different, not better or worse - just different. One simple and logical answer to all the unsolved questions about men and women, and the relationship between them. I just finished one chapter, and now reading the second one. I found some interesting things in the first chapter. They say men dominate the remote control. Well, I like to dominate the remote, but I'm 100% a woman. They also say that women has a short-range spatial skill, which makes them a bad map-reader. Well, I can read map and I don't have a problem telling right from left. But as I questioned that statements, I moved on the the 2nd chapter and find my answer there. But I won't tell you the answer untill I read the whole chapter. I really recommend this book. It has a lot of scientific explaination on those things that ticked you about both sexes. I'll put it on my list, on the left.  Aaaaaah, that's it for now. I need my nap therapy...cheers!

      Finally, the template editor works. A new featured link, just on the left. Check it out. More to come, the links page.  Ehem. I finally saw  John Vause !!!!! He is now at Nasiriya, covering on the meeting about Iraq future there. Oh, finally, finally, finally. *slap self* I gotta get a grip of myself.  Did watched  Band of Brothers . 3 full episodes. Aaaah,  Mr. Lewis  himself. Just so damn gorgeous. So people, do watch his new flick  Dreamcatcher . It's a must see. Weell, at least for  Damian  admirers.

      Heeeeeey! What happen to the template editor? I was going to put some new stuffs, but I guess that will have to wait.  I just found a Yahoo Groups on John Vause. Yeah, that's right. I can't believe it myself. There I was, just typing 'John Vause' on the group search, thinking 'Maybe..'. Then voila! There is a group dedicated to him. So now I'm officially  urlLink the group 's 6th or maybe 7th member. Hurrrah!!! There's a group to share my fixation.  I was going to put a link to another blog,  urlLink qHate.com . I read it once a while, the blog is about 'love and hate in Quwait'. It has a lot point of view from people who are Quwaities and live in Quwait. Right now, the reports on CNN are all about the allegation on Syria being 'helpful' to a lot of Iraqi officials. Whatever. Can people just hold that thoughts? There are a lot of other issues in Iraq than that, and more important! Humanitarian aids, please! A lot of people are suffering because of their wounds, but no humanitarian aids just yet. People are moving to slow. Get those damn aids there! You have troops all over, security is not supposed to be an hold-up for the aid. Aaaaaargh!!! I wish I could do more than this ranting. Is there any big air vessels that can carry a whole hospital? Guess not.  Oh what else? What else? Oh yeah, seems that Francesco Coco (the football/soccer player) is injured and would need a month to recover. Which means that he probably won't played again the rest of the season. Oh well, look at the bright side. I only need to watch 2 games now, Milan's and Juve's. Ah, 10.30 already. Better get going and watch that BOB vid. Let see...which episodes??

Also a featured links every posts, which will be archived on the links page.  Finally, I'm getting used to this. Hurraaah!!!  PS : Damn cable!!! Instead fixing the problem with Star TV, they change the channel. Not that I don't mind having Now!, FashionTV, and Soundtrack Channel...but I need Star World, you eedjits!!! I already missed Oprah for 3 weeks!!! Aaaaaaaargh!!!

      Another post? Yes. Another one. I'm trying to get use to this, so I changed the layout (again). But I'll stick with this one though. Don't worry. Another change will be made...not in a short time. Meanwhile, I'm also trying to costumize my blog. Been trying to remember some of the HTML tags. It's been a while since I made a website. One of the recent site I made was a tribute site to  Francesco Coco , an Italian football/soccer player who plays in   urlLink Internazionale Milan  . Don't bother to check the site. It has 'Under Construction' tag on the main page. Maybe I should be fixing it and run it again. As soon as my modem is repaired (it got hit by lightning one night, didn't blew up just refuses to recognize a dial tone). When? Soon. No actual or acurate answer to be made.  What else? Oh yes, no new report yet from  John Vause . The last one I saw was still the one about the Iraqi traffic police who were trained by British troops to control checkpoint. A short glimpse of Mr. Vause, the rest was just his voice on the report. Ah, better than nothing I guess. I'll try to find the url of his profile from the CNN.com as soon as possible. After I manage to get used to the HTML tags again. I've been using Netscape Composer for a while, that's why I've been neglecting HTML tags. I guess it's better to use the FrontPage...you can still see the HTML tags. But wait a minute, the latest Composer does have HTML view too. Oh well...fix the modem first, fix the modem first. There goes another spending. So when am I going to go back to my piano lesson?  Damn cable!!! Instead of fixing the problem of their subscription with the  STAR TV , they change the damn channel into something that didn't even aired. Then they got two, not one, two TV5 Asie. And they didn't recover RAI International. Damn them! I'm stopping my subscription if they still have this problems next month. I'm changing my cable service next month, if they can't get the STAR TV channels running. Totally not professional.

      Ahhhhhhhhh!!! Finally...me own blog. I've been wanting to have one for a while, but never seem has the...time to do it. Sure, I've known the net and the art of webmaking for years, but on the blog stuff...I'm a newbie. Thank god I found Blogger, a really cool and easy way to make me own blog.  This is my third week on 'vacation'. I've skipped classes for two weeks in a row now. Beginning to feel bored now. I have CNN on now, watching the reports from Iraq. What on now is the reports about the school music in Bagdad which got trashed in the so-called 'jubilation' after the city was freed. There are a few music instrument that got broken. A grand piano with no keys or lid or legs. Breaks me heart sometimes, watching all of this reports. Been thinking what I could do to help. Find one...which is so common. But then again, I don't exactly have the same opinion as others have. Pity.  Why watch CNN? Well, the Cartoon Network on my cable suddenly vanished. So the only reasonable thing to do is to switch to CNN. Just checking the latest development on the post-war Iraq. And...just incase  John Vause  pops up on the screen. Yes...I do have a fixation? A crush? An admiration? Oh whatever, bottom line...I do like  John Vause . There, I've said it. On the internet. On my blog, where people can see. Eeeuch. I feel sick suddenly. Need a dose of Ginger himself, quick. Bad thing is... Dreamcatcher  due in April 29th. Waaaaay tooo long for a dose of Mr. Lewis himself. Guess back to  Band of Brother , for a quick one.  Hmm, that's it for intro I guess. More Ginger fixation on the next posts. Cheers!

       Panic Attack   What is exactly signs of panic attack? I've been wondering that for a couple of days now. It all started when I realized that I'm now more...um, sensitive, a bit touchy, or even down-right cranky. I get upset over little things, the lamest scene on tv could make me cry. Then I realized that I got this funny feeling in my tummy. I wonder what it is. Is it a panic attack? Or is it just another hormonal events. It happens a lot. But I'm pretty sure this isn't PMS. Or is it? As in post menstrual syndrome? Does that even exist? The nausea happened again just about...now. Everytime I think of 'someone' doing 'something'...I feel a lump in my throat and nausea. Is it anger? Or just plain sickness. Yuuuck!!! And yuuuuuuck again!! Better search for panic attack at google. Then head downstairs for some chocolate. Yuuuuck!!! (translated as: Damn you, Coco!)

       New Found Inspiration  Oof! I finally back. Damn, it's been a while. I've been down and back. Just found my new found inspiration: emotional turnmoil. I guess now I understand how certain people need strong emotions throughout their life to obtain inspiration. It does give you a lot of inspiration. I hope I can find some...um, scientific explaination about the whole. Why? It makes the whole thing more understandable. So...how do you feel when you're in love? How does it feel to be in love? I just found out that when I'm in love, I get nauseated. Is this just me?  Coreshaker : someone who shakes your heart badly, your one great love (from episode 1, season 5, Sex and The City)  I also just found out who is my coreshaker, but I'm too shy to say who it is.

       The Aftermath  Okay, okay. So this all 'my coreshaker looses his shakes' is part my fault.............................. Okay, it's ALL my fault. I should put the blame on my exessive expectations. Fine, fine! My bad. But exessive expectations are like hope. Or maybe not. But one does expects things or rather guess from the visible traits of one other. Those we can see, becomes our base in judging, or in my case, assembling personalities of a coreshaker. Basically, one can dream, can't they? Or at least guess, hope, exessively expect. Whatever. So...what is a coreshaker? Someone who shakes your core. But now I should put a footnote on that description that say: Remember, he's only human. He's no angel, my coreshaker. Though his visible traits and personalities does somehow closely resemble one, he's no angel. He has faults, he made mistakes (he's divorced for crying out loud), so what if he is a playboy. So what if he is a player...he's still a man (a real man, for sure). Bottomline, keep in mind that a coreshaker is still human, definetely no angel at all. Whatever...

      It's a sad day. I just heard that one of my sister's friend just died. She had a motorbike accident just yesterday. She was thrown off the bike, hit the road, then dragged a few more feet. She broke her neck and fractured her skull. When she was brought to the hospital, the doctors said that it was only a matter of hours. She would not make it. It is a sad tradegy.  This happened when the girl was just finishing her high school. Just days away from her graduation and weeks away from enroling college. A youth soul cut short. It happened so suddenly. No one ever expected it. But it did happen. And it makes me think.  This probably would not have happen if: Her boyfriend ride the bike carefully, not speeding, and not trying to cut the traffic from the opposite side because he wanted to go faster. This happens a lot lately. Motorbike riders sometimes do not care about the rule, therefor do not care about their own safety and the safety of the people they are riding with. They cut traffic. They go zig-zagging inside the crowded traffic to find a very tight space, so they could reach their destination faster. Bottom line, they're not careful just for the sake of getting there faster.  She wears the proper gear for motorbike, which is a motorbike helmet. This also breaking the rules. Not that I want bad-mouthing a deceased person or anything. I just thought to point out that this also happens a lot lately. People, the rider and the ridee, wears unproper helmets. I've seen it so many times.  It makes me think a lot. I've been quite upset about the condition of the motorbike lately. They're getting rude and unsafe more and more each day. And when this happens, it just prove it. This is the case, the example.  To all the motorbike riders and ridee out there, please be careful. An extra concern note to the riders. You have the advantage of being the riders, please be careful. The ridee is not going to be as lucky as you are if something happens. So remember when you drive carelessly, you are endangering another person. That you have someone else's life in your hands. I'm sure you don't want to life forever regreting your careless driving.  PLEASE BE SAFE!

      Okay, this is disappointing. First, it was Jennifer. Then George Huff. And now? LaToya. Those are three of four the best singers in the competition. Hellooooow? What's happening? What's next? Fantasia? If she ever get voted-off, my American Idol-watching-routine is gone baby! No more American Idol in this house. I can't believe that two of the 'alright' singers stay on the competition. Because of what? Are they good singers? Not as good as those three (Jen, George, LaToya)! Are they good looking? Well, surely people think so seeing the way they stay. For your information...it's a singing competition, not a popularity contest. This is turning to be the ugliest season ever. Even Ryan Seacrest doesn't worth it if Fantasia got booted.  When Jennifer was voted off, I stayed on. When George Huff was voted off, I shruged off the possibility of stop watching. I will stay watching until it turns to the ugliest possibility ever...that two 'alright' singer is going to fight for the top position and it's runner up. If that happens, that's it. Might as well rename the show into something like American something.  Wait, I have take care of my zit first. Damn these hormons.  Okay, back. Got a cotton with alcohol on it. Hurt a little, but the price to be beautiful. Hwahahahaha. I can't believe I've said that.  All of this mess wouldn't have happen if...I could vote. Being geographical impossible to vote get to my nerve. I'll pay good amount of money if only I can vote. *sigh* Me feel bad. Me feel a piece of cookies coming right into my mouth this any minute. Wait...okay, I still can eat something. Cut-off time is 8 pm. I'm off...to get my cookie.

      This is the end for the azzurri. Just as some of their fans predicted, they didn't make it to the final 8. They gained a victory against Bulgaria for 2-1. But the Swedes and the Danish drew on 2-2, making the victory nothing but a bittersweet taste of the Euro. And their ticket home.  Farewell, Azzurri. Hope this misfortune would be a way to better Azzurri next time. We'll see you in Germany 2006.  *solemnly puts a mourning outfit*

      Fresh from watching the match of Italy vs Sweden which resulted in a (another) draw. Only this time it's 1-1. The italians led first when Cassano headed a pass from Panucci. But came the second half, the italians were tired and under a lot of pressure. Just 5 minutes before the 90 minutes time is up, the swedes even the score. It was 1-1 by Ibrahimovic. The score stayed unchange until the time is up and quoting the commentator 'Italy's hope is hang by a thread'.  Honestly, I do feel disappointed (naturally). After having a glimpse of glory, I was denied by the mishap in front of the net. I'm not blaming anyone. It has been a rough european campaign for Italy. First, their opening match against the Danish resulted in a goalless draw. Then misfortune came with the form of Totti's 3 matches ban (which personally, it's not such a great loss). Now, the whole campaign hangs by a thread after another draw. But also frankly, I don't think that Italy would make it to the finals. They still have a chance by beating Bulgary next week. But only if the swedes also defeat the danish. If the danish wins, the italians have to pack their bags and go home sooner than they expected. The whole thing does remind me of what happen to France at the World Cup 2002. Could it happen again, this time round to Italy? We'll just have to wait and see.  I do feel disappointed more than I wanted to, till the point of accepting the simplest consolation like having Trulli finally finishes (at what cost) at the USA Grand Prix, after having (another) misfortune at the Canada GP last week. Golly, even seeing him is a consolation (naturally).  Well, off to bed now.

      Aaaaaaaaaaarrrrrgggh!!! This has been a helluva day! Don't mind the spelling now, I'm sleepy right now. It's 15 past midnight and I only had 1 hour of napping.  Did some shopping this morning. Got myself a...wait, two new pillows and two new pillowcases. Loves the color. It's baby blue with faded parquet texture. Just my thing. Didn't buy any holster yet. Maybe next mind, oops, next month. But planning the color combination right now. Damn, so sleepy right now.  Let's just get to the highlight of the day shall we? I need my beauty sleep. Anyway, I was rushing over to the cinema to see the new Harry Potter movie. Stood on me line, bothering me own business, when three ungrateful, spoiled, impolite, barbaric people just stand on the wrong side of the line. They were trying to swipe the line! Bloody barbarians they are. Nasty too. Got all steam up and decided to do all or nothing (with my dear cousin encouragement of course. Love you lass). Tap one on her shoulder, let her know there was only one line. Yes, ONE line u eedjit. One minute later, she was gone leaving her somewhat younger companion still on the WRONG side of the lane. Guess what? She came back dragging an awful looking thing I presummed her brother. And he, instead correcting her manner, stood on her previous post. I assumed they are siblings, you can see clearly from their manners and behaviour. Implecably rotten. Nasty rotten. Then my dear cousin (who was standing behind me) said that we should leave it to the boys (there's a man in front of me). She suggested that we should see if he (the man standing in front of me on the RIGHT lane) would up to the challenge. And bloody well, he wasn't! Then it all up to the ladies then. Almost on the edge of the lane, we tap him (the ungrateful lot) on the back and ask him to get in line. Yes, the RIGHT lane you eedjit. And like any other ungrateful lots, he refused and claimed that he got there before we do. How nice...rotten and a lying smug. They are definetely siblings. And apparantly badly need some bottlebottom glasses because he didn't see me there standing on the lane, before he did. Me! Me! The big girl with white shirt. Hello? Oh wait...he didn't have his glasses on. And his manner too. Damn those three ungrateful, rotten lots.  Anyway, there's me story on today's event. I'll be back tomorrow for the review on Harry Potter (who is turning out to be fine young lad. Watch out Orlando). Without the rage of course (thos damn ungrateful, rotten, impolite, barbaric eedjits).   Ps. If anyone feel offended, well...since I'm not in a very good mood...bugger off! Don't mind me post then.

      So what do you with your past if it comes knocking on the door? Do you confront it? Do you embrace it? Do you...throw stones at it? Do you run from it? Do you hide from it? Me, I still have trouble deciding what to do. Sometimes I want to run and hide. Sometimes I just want to throw stones or something at it. But never was I confront it or even embrace it. I was too scare, too frightened, to be able to look it on the eye.  Well, one of my past just blast in yesterday (hence the title). It came so sudden, unexpected. I was browsing friendster just the other day. Clicking around on my kindegarten-elementary-junior-school page, when I saw someone I know from school time. He was this popular guy, not my crush but I had some encounter with him. I click his pix to get to his profile page. And there it was...on his list of friends, my old flame. The guy I proclaimed my first love, smiling in his pix. 'Damn' was my first reaction, 'I didn't expect this', was my second. Then while keep cursing (silently of course, didn't want to upset anyone), I click his smilling pic. The curiosity got the better of me.  So...I read his profile and found out that he's married and his job. Then I read the testimonials and found out his wife's name. Also he's a daddy-to-be. And I was...like...well, blasted. 'Damn' I said again. 'He has a good life' I said silently. Then I was...upset, unbalanced, or whatever. I didn't like that, for sure. I was ticked that he's having a good life when a couple of years ago he broke my heart. Wait, did he? Yeah, he did. He broke it with the worst possible scenario a broken heart could have.  I've been broken hearted before him. It was harsh, hard, and cruel. The guy totally reject me in the cruelest way. I was angry, gutted, pissed, and vowed for revenge. But it was the easy way out of love. It's like having your wound ripped even wider. But instead making it worse, it healed faster. I have no grunge or what-so-ever with that guy. But this guy...he didn't reject me, dissed me, or did something harsh. He was nice, friendly, kind, etc. At that time, I was so damn in love, so...so...in 7th heaven, so...so...on cloud nine, I thought there's something behind his niceness. I mistaken the signal...I thought I had hope, but he was just being nice.  It was the worst. It feels like you're flying with wings, frolicking between the clouds...then *poof* the wings are gone and you're falling down. But the fall feels like taking forever. And even when you hit the ground, you're still going even lower. The detox took almost 5 years. And it was costly...for me.  To be continued...

      Just saw  urlLink Van Helsing  last Sunday. It was...well, how do I put it? Felt like watching another sequel of  urlLink The Mummy . Only this time it's  urlLink Hugh Jackman , instead of  urlLink Brendan Fraser .  urlLink Kate Beckinsale  instead of  urlLink Rachel Weisz . And it's Count Draculla instead of Imhotep. The action was good. One thing about this  urlLink Stephen Sommers ' movie...like it's predecessor it was damn good thriller. Every scary scene, I could feel the intensity. And the hair on the back of my neck started to rise. I remember I was holding the collar part of my t-shirt, ready to pull it up and hide.  But I also remember how buff  urlLink Hugh Jackman  is. Especially when he ripped his shirt, ready to turn into werewolf to kill Count Draculla. Wooooohooo! A feast for a woman's eyes. There are a lot of scenes showing  urlLink Hugh Jackman 's buff body. It's one of it's strong point I must say. But there aren't much...well, exposure other than that. The vampire brides wear these sexy outfit, but not too sexy.  urlLink Kate Beckinsale  wears this corset kind of outfit. The only exposure done are by the men of the story.  One notable performance is by  urlLink Lord of the Ring 's Faramir,  urlLink David Wenham . It's a total turnaround from his role in the famous trilogy.  urlLink David Wenham  plays the role of Carl, the friar that follows Van Helsing to Transylvania. Carl provided the comic relief in most of the scene. He's clumsy, slow-witted, scared easily. But what fascinate me is that it's different role from Faramir. But  urlLink David Wenham  play it excellently. He did great. He made me laugh uncontrolably...a lot. Well, that happened maybe becoz I was comparing him the Faramir through out the movie. My fave scene is the one when Carl and Van Helsing are in Rome, under the cathedral. Carl is showing Van Helsing around, when he shows him a big batch of glyserine. He takes a drop on his finger, and throws it toward a bunch of barrels. The barrels explodes, surprising people. Carl appologizes, and when he turns around facing the camera he's wearing this thing (looks like a goggle or glasses, just like the one  urlLink Johnny Depp  wears in  urlLink Sleepy Hollow ) and it makes his eyes looks bigger. And that just hit me like...a lightning of tickles, and I laugh so hard! So hard, I have to hold myself back real hard not to laugh outloud (nobody's laughing...or at least what I remembered). Good job,  urlLink David Wenham !  I didn't put this post on my other blog ( urlLink Lemontee's Favorite Things ). Despite I love  urlLink David Wenham 's performance in it, it's not that good overall. Especially the vampire part, it's a bit lame. Seriously. Totally lame. Even  urlLink Queen of the Damned  looks better than that.

      I was just reading this book this morning. It was written by  Ann Brashares . I read the Indonesian version of course. They brand it TeenLit, meaning Teen Literature. The four main characters: Lena, Tibby, Carmen, and Bridget; are teens. The book told their second summer after they found the sisterhood pants (read the book for more explaination). Even though they are teens, their stories somehow resonate to most people's stories. Me, a 23 year old woman, even thinks it's a good book.  But I'm not talking about the book here. Well, it started when I was reading it. I was reading the story of Bridget, who visit her mother's hometown to find and get to know her grandmother. And it dawns to me, as I was helping my dad close the gate and the garage door, that I don't really know much about my dad. I was looking at his pair of badminton/tenish shoes, thinking why he bought them. Does he play tennis? If yes, when? And with who? Despite the reason why he bought the shoes are clear (to play tennis), but the latter questions haunted me. When and with who? Then I realize I don't much about him. There's a lot of his history that I don't know. I usually found out about it when it already happened for a while (could be for years). Like when he went to India. I didn't know about it untill he told my sister, then my sister told me. I also didn't know that he had pilgrimage (sp?) until my dad told my mom, then my mom told me. I'm almost totally clueless about him. I also didn't know he actually played football (soccer) and was a star. But an injury forced him to retire. I know bit of pieces of his life...told years after it happen. I understand if they happened before I was born. But the things happened after I was born...it shouldn't take years.  I sort of the made a promise to get to know my dad a little better. Just now...the promise fade away. Just because he told me to change the channel (I was watching Powerpuff Girls), because he thinks that 'it has no benefit'. A sense of rebelness take over. What about happiness? What about joy? What about enjoying myself? I linger a little on the channel (in case you didn't guess, it's Cartoon Network), but a stroke of fear overtake me. And I flip around the remote, changing channel. Then I realize...I still fear my dad's wrath of anger. No, no...he wasn't abusive. But I did have several bad incident involving his anger, which turn out to have more impact that I thought. I'm still affraid to invoke his anger. And I still fear that it would be a heavy one.  My super-quick analytic ability took over. I over-analize everything...it's a habit, a not-so-benefitting one. I analize why I still like cartoons (like any other people), why I still fear my dad, why I couldn't stand up to him, etc. I also quietly say inside my mind that even though he tries to have new visions, thinking outside the box, he still puts me in a box. Since I'm his daughter, I should follow his guidelines. Being 23 years old means I'm an adult. An adult is not suppose to like cartoon. Because it doesn't give you any benefit. Then I see through all his effort all this time...he was trying to make me an adult as early as he can. My mom told me about this several times : 'He was just trying to make u independent, just in case. Because you are the oldest daughter'. Unfortunately...his plan and efforts had backfire. I'm maybe 23 years old...but there's a child screaming inside of me. Knocking my conscious with all her might. The age may be right...but my emotional age is not. I don't feel like an adult...I don't want to be one. I don't want to get older. And by that, all the efforts backfire. Instead making me an independent, responsible adult...I'm almost the opposite.  ...It just backfire...  ...Am I depressed?...  ...Yes, totally...

      I'm thinking how one of my unwritten-but-exciting stories ends, I realize that giving up is really hard to do. If I was to surrender to the lost of the fight, start the journey home to the man-who-will-accept-me-as-I-am with my tail between my legs...It would be somehow a very tragic defeat indeed. I am such a fighter inside, but somehow that spirit doesn't translate outside.  ...  Or maybe it's just because this anxiety that I have after a very surprising and shocking accident at Silverstone, which unfortunately was involving Trulli. Luckily, he is unhurt and ready for the next race. Damn it...I could've had a heart attack.

      Aaaaaargh!!! I cannot believe it. Czech Rep lost to Greece for a single silver goal. Okay, the tournament has officially became suck. Now what excuse do I need to watch the final? Portugal? Greece? I don't even know them. Oh gosh, this year's tournament been so kind to the underdogs.  The upperdogs mostly been eliminated, except for Portugal (they're the host, so they have the benefit of "host syndrome"). Italy and Germany didn't even make it out of the group phase. Italy was stopped by Duo Nordic, Sweden and Denmark. Italy's performance was...well, a little poor. They didn't live up to their reputation as the 'football nation'...the nation with the best football league. Italy did two in-a-row draw and a win, but to a bitter end. They were...stumped by the Duo Nordic draw performance. Germany also didn't live up to their reputation. But I can't blame them...they were at the hellish group with Czech Rep and Netherlands. The competition were stiff, and one of them got to go home early.  Moving on to the quarter finals, England was beaten by Portugal after a dramatic penalty shootout. England media and fans blamed the loss to the referee, the likely scapegoat, for giving the Portugal a penalty when the Brits are winning. Making the match end in a 2-2 draw, forcing the Brits to go into extra time. I also heard that some sportcaster has became so irritated that he crosses the journalism ethic (source: Forza Juventus mailing list). What a sore loser. Anyway, the next upperdogs that fell down the drain are France, who lost to Greece for a single goal. The coach claimed that exhaustion is the reason. Well, at least they don't point their finger to the referee (like some team). That would be the sooooo cliche.  Overall...it's been disappointing! I have lost interest since the first Italy's match. The poor performance and the spitting incident has left me cold...and yearning for my sleeping time. But since Euro only happens once in 4 years (thank god it's another four years from now), I kept on watching. And like I've predicted, it didn't fail to disappoint me. The upperdogs fell flat on their faces and the underdogs rules. But the salute goes to Greece, who has advance so far without any some sort of tricks (Well done, greeks!). The big award of unsportsmanship goes to the Duo Nordic, Denmark and Sweden. And the sore loser award goes to the Brits (Yes, it sucks to lose doesn't it?).  The final is approaching the end is near. But I already putting my nightcap on and my slippers off. I'm (so) ready to say "farewell Euro 2004, welcome World Cup 2006".   Disclaimer: Offended? Well, bugger off. I don't take nasty harassments. Decent comments are welcome though.
