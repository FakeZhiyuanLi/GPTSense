						   We found a church!&nbsp; On Sunday, we went to the Vineyard church right across the street from Ben's work.&nbsp; We went to the 7:30pm service, which is lovely because that means we can sleep in on Sundays. :)&nbsp; We wore our "nice clothes", but when we walked in, we were greeted with a sea of jeans and casual-ness, which was also great.&nbsp; Looking forward to wearing comfy clothes to church (just like back home).&nbsp; The evening service was probably 80% people in our age group (25 - 35)&nbsp; so hopefully we'll find people to get to know.&nbsp; They are starting small group Bible studies in September so we'll join one then and get to know some people.&nbsp; They had coffee and tea before the service started, and in typical Tracie fashion, I accidentally grabbed a spoon from the used-spoon pile to dump my sugar in.&nbsp; Yum!&nbsp; After the sermon, before everything wrapped up, the pastor said, "The bar will open up after the service."&nbsp; Ben and I shared a chuckle at how that sounded, and assumed he meant coffee bar. We were wrong. We stood up and turned around to leave, and before us we saw a full bar, and a bunch of people standing around drinking pints.&nbsp; They had hard liquor and everything too.&nbsp; I don't think I've laughed that hard in months, just out of pure shock.&nbsp; It was just unbelievable!&nbsp; I personally have no problem with drinking in moderation, but I just never ever imagined I'd see a bar at a church!&nbsp;  I've noticed some interesting word situations.&nbsp; One of Ben's co-workers was on the phone to his fiancee and they were talking about this waterpark they were going to take us to.&nbsp; His co-worker said, "She says it's run down and falling apart.&nbsp; How does that sound?" and Ben said, "That sounds awesome!" and he said to the phone, "He said that sounds great!" and I wondered why he hadn't said 'awesome' like Ben did.&nbsp; Then I read an article in the paper that talked about the things that have come over from the states, and it listed the word "awesome."&nbsp; I guess that didn't quite take over here.&nbsp; We're going to have to start saying "brilliant" instead.&nbsp; I have actually heard the words "daft", "blimey", and "bloody" all used in real sentences!  While 'awesome' didn't take, unfortunately, my friends, the mullet has taken.&nbsp; And it's making a come-back.&nbsp; We've all known 80's clothes are slowly making their comeback (which makes me feel way too old), but to augment them, it seems the mullet is tagging along.&nbsp; I've seen way too many mullets over here, on people who otherwise look fashionable.&nbsp; If I come home at Christmas sporting a mullet, hold me down and shave my head. Well, there's a bunch more to write, but Ben just got off work and he's starving so he's dragging me off to get some fish 'n chips or something.&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp;

						   We got approved on the town house and are moving into our new place on Saturday - I'm so excited!!!! While I really like our housemates, there is something to be said for having the house to ourselves and not having to time my shower around everyone else's.  Wheeeee!

						   Well, I've made it through the job interview.  Whew!  It wasn't as horrendous as I'd feared.  And it wasn't with Catherine, although I did see her today and made VERY SURE to call her Catherine. :)  They wanted to know all the usual stuff - all about my past work experience and how I'd handle different situations and how I was as a person and what I've learned in my past jobs, yadda yadda.  I feel like I did okay, so if I don't get the job, at least I won't think to myself, "If only I had done better in the interview, I might have gotten the job!"  Of course there are always things I would change about what I said, but it's fine.  The second interview is next week or the week after, and she told me they'd be reviewing the rest of the applicants too.  So I'm not getting my hopes too high, but I'm not ruling it out either.  This weekend we went to the Nottingham Castle!  It was so fascinating.  We took the bus into town and walked about 20 minutes to the Castle.  Right before we got there, we found a church with gravestones dating from the 1700's.  We walked around and read them; a lot of them were sad, being little babies or talking about how the whole family was buried there within a couple of years of each other.  A lot of them died at what in current times we consider to be young ages - often in their 40's.  When we got up to the castle, the only part left from the actual, real castle that was built in the 1100's is the castle wall and the moat (now filled with trees and paths).  In the 1600's, a mansion was built where the castle used to be and it now houses a museum.  We went on a tour of the tunnels and caves under the castle, and saw a real dungeon.  Freaky.  At the foot of the castle are caves where they used to store bodies during the Black Plague to try to keep it from spreading.  You just gotta wonder if some little fragment of the Plague somehow remained somewhere and is just waiting to spring back... or maybe I've just watched too many movies like Outbreak.  We saw the oldest pub in England, where the crusaders used to drink before they left to convert the world in their barbarous ways.  Then we went to the oldest building in Nottingham, a mideveil shop that looks just like they do in the movies. :) We finished off the day with shopping in the mall, a nice flash of Americana.  I just can't wrap my mind around the fact that I am surrounded by so many ooooold things.  It's so amazing.  I touch the wall of a building and wonder who else has touched that wall in the last 500 or 1000 years.

						   Wow, what a week it's been!  On Tuesday, Tish from HR drove Ben and I around to look at houses.  I was really sick that day and had thrown up that morning (no, I'm not pregnant, but my entire gastronomic system is very unhappy with the new food I'm shoving into it and my bizarre sleep schedule) but I really wanted to go out and look at homes so I stuck it out.  We wanted to get something in the area so that Ben could walk to work if possible (the bus is pretty expensive) so we drove around for ahwile, looking at places with For Let signs up and writing down their phone numbers.  We then drove over to Belvoir Lettings and told them what we were looking for - 2 bedrooms, £550 a month or less, furnished, and oh yeah, we have a menagerie of animals we'd like to bring with us.  Well, that last part just didn't fly.  Probably about 90% of the lettings are "no pets", 9% are "pets negotiable", and 1% is "bring on your lovely pets!"  We are so used to the Northwest where everyone has pets and if one rental won't take them, the one right next door will.  The guy at Belvoir also told us that "pets negotiable" usually means "one cat negotiable" and that it would be hard to find a place for our puppy Pip.  He came up with a place that doesn't accept pets but was very close to Ben's work, so we went to the open house at 1:00pm that day.  It was very cute, 2 bedrooms, fully furnished (with Ikea-style furnishings, the man made sure to tell us several times), and has a nice big backyard with a fruit tree!  And a washer and dryer!  There were three other people looking at it at the same time, so when we got back to the car, we decided to try to get it!  It was the first place we looked at, but we figured we liked it so why not.  We raced back to Ben's office and called Belvoir Lettings, and we were the first ones, so we paid our application fee (usually around $30 in the US - £179 IN THE UK!!!) and our deposit and I think we're good to go.  We had to turn in applications, so I don't know if they are going to do a credit check or what, so we'll have to see, but I think we got the place!  And how's this for coincidence - one of Ben's housemates just moved into a new room and his old room is free, with its closet and DOUBLE BED, till July 17th.  We can move into our new house on... you guessed it!  July 17th!  But I don't believe in coincidence, I believe God is blessing us!  Woo hoo!  So we have slept much nicer the last couple nights.  I love the man but I can only take so many elbows in my side all night. We will have a six-month lease there, which is how long it will be until my puppy and kitties can come over.  At that point in time, we will hope either the landlord has had a major change of heart and is willing to let our pets come live with us, or we'll move.  Luckily, since it's fully furnished, it won't be too big of a deal to move.  And at least this will give us time to find a good place that will take pets and not grab the first thing we see.  We are considering, though, not bringing our kitties over... it is so stressful on them to fly and move to yet another new house, and it might be better for them to just wait for us in the States.  Pip would adjust much more easily to the new place and the flight, I think.  So that's something we're thinking about.  Plus, it will be a lot easier to convince someone to take one puppy than one puppy and two kitties.  We'll see.  Sad. :(  I saw a commercial for cat food last night that had a big fluffy gray kitty on it, and it looked so much like my Koshka that I burst into tears. :(  I miss my babies!!!  I've been dreaming about Pip pretty much every night. In other news, I've got a job interview on Monday at 11:00am, YIKES!  I'm super nervous about it. I haven't interviewed in so long!  (Except for MFT, but that was different than a job.  That was a life passion.  This is, "Hey, I want to work in your office!").  After the interview, they give you a "psychometric exam" to assess your personality (Myers Briggs?) and a math and english exam (to make sure you're not stupid).  I AM stupid in math, so I hope I don't totally and completely embarass myself.  Ben slid by all that since he got transferred from the US, lucky guy.  The job is for the coordinator of the learning center, which sounds really cool!  They also have an opening for a personal assistant to some lady, which they are also interviewing me for, but I'm not as thrilled about that one.  But I'm sure any job would be great!  They think I can piggyback on Ben's work permit, so I hope that's the case!  I was actually hoping I could be a bar wench or something like that, that I'd probably never do in the States, but if this is what God wants to drop into my lap, I'm not arguing.  Like literally, I didn't even seek this out.  They approached me and the next thing I knew I had an interview set up!  The HR lady told me that this is the time of year when a lot of people are getting out of school with their new qualifications and are applying for jobs, so there will probably be a lot of competition, so I'm not getting my hopes up too high.  We shall see!   So, to add to the blunder list: Wednesday I went to Belvoir Lettings to turn in Ben and I's applications.  As I sat down, I got this cough in my throat.  Every time I tried to talk, I coughed.  I had tears streaming down my face, and the handsome fellow at the desk didn't quite know what to do with me.  I got my voice back, and then he asked me a question, and I started coughing again.  It looked like I was trying to cover something up or something.  Wednesday, I decided to wash my hair in the sink.  They have a hot spigot and a cold spigot.  The hot got REALLY hot REALLY fast, so I had to wash my hair under the freezing cold spigot.  Then, the sink is super tiny, so I discovered that once I started using only the cold side, I couldn't fit the left side of my head under the spigot to get the soap out!!  So I was getting total brain freeze trying to make my head become a contortionist and scoop water over to get the soap out.  It was a lovely morning. :D  Then, today, I came in here to Ben's work to the Learning Center to use their computers to e-mail.  Just as I got here, I saw the HR lady that I met with Wednesday, and who will be interviewing me on Monday.  We chatted for awhile, and as she stood to leave, I said, "Thanks, Elizabeth!"  Then I stared in utter horror at her back as she walked away, because her name is CATHERINE!!!  I have no idea where I got Elizabeth. :(  She didn't react or say anything.  Argh!!!  Another great impression I made!  "Hire me, I forget who I'm talking to in the middle of a conversation!" This upcoming weekend we are going to play tourist and visit the castle and Sherwood Forest and all that good stuff.  Can't wait!

						   Whew, here we are!  Our flight left Saturday, July 3rd, due to a long wait for our visas.  The flight was fine except for a little turbulence over Greenland which freaked me out.  The townhouse we are staying in is really cute!  It has a cute back yard (back garden as they say here) and lots of windows which equals lots of light.  Our room is tiny (English bedrooms are classified as "double" or "single" and we have a single).  Our luggage takes up the entire floor.  Last night we found that we could indeed squish both of ourselves into a single bed, but it wasn't the most lovely sleep I've ever had. :)  Today I came to work with Ben (we slept 10 hours and I think we're beating jet lag pretty well!) so I could learn the bus system and see the city and I've been reading People and Time while he works.  A lot of his co-workers have gone out of their way to come up to me and chat with me for awhile.  Most of them are around our age so I see some friend potential!  Yay!  So far my experience of the English has been that they are incredibly nice and welcoming.  Ben and I met with Human Resources today and one of the ladies is going to drive us around tomorrow and help us find a flat or home to rent.  I feel relieved that we will have some help! So far today I've managed to: put my money in the wrong slot on the bus so the driver had to ask me which transfer I wanted but I couldn't understand what he was saying so I just stared at him like an idiot and finally he printed out the wrong transfer for me; I spilled a pop all over the floor by Ben's desk; I tripped up the stairs; and I met one of Ben's co-workers who he bought Cinammon gum for in the US.  She came over to introduce herself and thank me for getting her the gum.  I said, "So you can't get Cinnamon gum over here?" and she said, "No," and I said, "Well, where did you have it that you found out you liked it if you can't get it in England?" and she stared at me and said, "I'm from Canada, can't you tell that I don't have an English accent?!" and then I felt like a total and complete idiot because it was obvious she didn't have an English accent but somehow I hadn't registered that fact.  Nice first impression I made!  (Marie, she's from Surrey.  I thought about asking her if she knew my friend Marie from Canada, but I figured I'd already made a big enough blunder for one day). I left my puppy on Friday evening and I'm really sad about it (thanks Craig and Rochelle for taking my little bundle of insanity).  I lived with my sister and her hubby for over a month before I left so I got really attached to them and am missing them like crazy, and the rest of my family and friends too.  But I just have to get through that time of adjustment where I grieve the loss of leaving my home and I know that in time I will get used to it.  I'm absolutely THRILLED to be here.  As soon as I adjust to living in Nottingham, we are going to start visiting Euope!  But I feel like I want to settle in here first before we start going all over the place.   Ben's work has a learning center and I found out I can use their computers, so I'll be able to come in to work with him and e-mail.  They also have a gym we are going to join and a bar where I just had a beer with my lunch.  Fun fun!   The HR lady thinks that I can get a job as a work-permit dependent.  I hope she is right!  I'm going to look into the possibilities.  She sent me some links to some employment agencies that she thinks I should look up.  So we shall see!

						   Let me just say, I adore reading all of your responses to my postings!  Thank you so much for all of your thoughts.   We've had a lot of fun lately, but are itching to travel.  It's painful to be so close to so many amazing things but not have visited them yet.  Of course, we've got to figure out just how much money we have to spend on fun things like travel, and with me not working yet, there isn't a huge amount of "fun money."  There are some amazing travel deals though, so I'm sure we'll make do.  The problem is deciding where to go first... Scotland?  Ireland?  Wales?  Paris?  Italy????????? Of course, money is only useful when you can get your physical hands on it.  That is to say, if we were able to get a bank account, we could deposit Ben's paycheck and everyone would be happy.  However, getting a bank account in this country, as a foreigner, is harder than getting a personal appointment for afternoon tea with the Queen.  In America, one walks into a bank with 25 bucks, and in 15 minutes, one has walked out with a checking account, savings account, and debit card.  In England, however, the story is a little different.  Two weeks ago, we went in and met with the bank officer who was going to help us set up our account, Gareth.  He looked younger than us and was quite friendly.  At first, he was going to give us the "crap account," (my name for it) that they give to the non-English.  Our friends from New Zealand who are living here in Nottingham have ended up with this account.  After applying to 6 or 7 banks and getting turned down by all of them, they finally got the "you're-a-foreigner-and-we-don't-trust-you" account.  It has no checking, so they can't write checks for their bills, no online services, and the debit card is only taken by a few places.  Luckily, our friend Gareth was able to get us a better account based on the fact that Ben was making over £15,000 and some other factors.  So we spent about an hour in his office, slowly going through this enormous application, with Gareth making about 50 copies of every document we could possibly come up with (from passports to Ben's job offer to our marriage certificate).  We finally finished up the app, and Gareth mailed it off to London to be inspected by some high bank official to detect any signs that we might commit fraud, rob the bank, or write 500 bad checks.  We got a letter in the mail a week later, saying that our application was being processed.  A week after  that , we called Gareth and he called London and found out that someone had not seen the note he had placed on our file to get us processed, and they had already mailed us another huge application packet.  Gareth told us that when it comes, we should ignore it, because now that he's talked to them, they are going to speedily process our application.  We shall see!    So until then, we have borrowed money from my parents (generous, lovely parents!) so we can continue to afford blood pudding and kidney pie. :) I never heard back after that job interview, so I'm going to assume that's a no-go.  It's actually a relief; the day after the interview, I had that sick-tummy feeling about the job - I just didn't want it.  But I would have felt like I had to take it had I been offered it.  I'm looking at some jobs at the University of Nottingham, so we'll see if anything works out there.  We also can't set up the internet or get a cell phone until we have a bank account (both require direct debit) so my job search is a little inhibited at the moment. We had some fun this weekend, went to a pub with our New Zealand friends Milly and Chris on Friday night and decided to start a little Bible study with them, so that should be neat.  Saturday night one of Ben's co-workers dj'd at a club so we went to hear him and he was amazing!  However, nobody warned us that it was a super-gothic club, so we all felt stupid in our "regular" clothes, surrounded by people wearing all black, pierced everywhere, crazy hair, eye liner on the guys.  At least I could have worn black, but by Murphy's Law, I was wearing a white top.  In the black light, let's just say I stood out amongst the crowd.  However, everyone we met was super nice and didn't care that we stuck out like sore thumbs.  I guess, if you dress goth to be different, then maybe you appreciate people who are different in the midst of sameness.  I mean, they all looked the same in there, and  we  were the ones who looked different.  I've kinda always had this hidden desire to express my dark side that way - to be punkish and gothy in my dress.  I blame it on growing up listening to Robert Smith (the Cure).  However, I've never gone there.  When you move to a new country, you can reinvent yourself, right?  Watch out, I may come home looking like something from The Nightmare Before Christmas, or I may come home with a mullet.  You just never know.
