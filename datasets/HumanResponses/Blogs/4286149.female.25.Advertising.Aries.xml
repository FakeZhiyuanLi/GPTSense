      til 4 am It was sister reajoy's birthday again, another year has passed, hindi namin namalayan,, isang taon nap ala at magkikita ulit kameng magkakaklase. Tama, every birthday ni sis lang kami nakukompleto, well, almost, kase yung iba ndi nakarating. Pero mahirap naman mangyare yun, dahil some of us arent residing here anymore, si ivy nasa north carolina and si inna nasa canada. Yung iba, ang hirap hagilapin.  Nagpost ako ng bulletin days before the event. Actually, we planned this a week na, when we met at a book fair in World Trade Center at Roxas. This time hindi na surprise for sister. Last year's event kase was a surprise party at their convent, nagpot-luck kme. Now we decided to have dinner outside. Initial plan was in Dampa (seafood market at Baclaran), but friday (a day before our planned date) Con texted na Gerry's Grill located at Blue Wave, Roxas Blvd, na lng. Doon kame nagdinner nung nagkita-kita kme for the book fair. Not bad.  Friday, I was texting people to confirm if they are coming or not, for the headcount for the reservation, also, yung mga isasabay ko, to go there. I  will be passing by edsa and will meet them at glorietta4. Saturday, 3pm. I was ready to go, I first met Gabs and Iso since we're like kapitbahays in this side of country which is the east. Then off to Makati. First time I passed thru Kalayaan going Edsa. Normally, I would take the Fort route then Buendia to get to Ayala Ave. I was sharing a story to Gabs and Iso that the last time our section met, nahuli ako sa may Heritage Hotel for swerving violation. P200 kotong din yun! I took the left turn from Kalayaan ave to Edsa, as I drove nearer to turn to ayala ave, while sharing the story, I saw a MMDA waving for me to stop the car! Ano na naman ito?! A yellow lane violation. I explained that I was about to turn right Ayala Ave, that is why. Kesyo 100m dapat pala ako magchange lane. Aba may panukat ba sila, I mean I was really near to my turn. He got my license, but I know that he should not be doing that according to the latest ruling. Akala nya hindi ko alam. Pero 500 pa rin ang babayaran ko if he issues me a ticket. So, cge na, I was making excuses that I cannot afford that, that I am only a student. "Bahala ka na!" he replied while giving me back my license. A likely story, isnt it?! So I gave him my precious P100 bill (maliit na halaga pero ang masakit ay yung thought na  naisahan ka na naman) Certified Huli-Magnet ako. They say maybe because babae ako.  We met apple and waited at tower records, for G, but she was caught in traffic goin to where we were, so we decided to go ahead. Nakarating na din kame ng Roxas, 30 mins less drive from Makati. They ordered already. I brought our compiled pictures (my collection) of our whereabouts in college. Our beach trips, Ilocos trip, Baccaulareate, Graduation pics...andami, ansaya to go back to the old times tru those pics. We look at them while waiting for the food to be served, at syempre, mawawala ba naman ang camera ko? Another momentous occasion, added to my collection of photos. At ayan na ang waiter, may crispy pata, sinigang na hipon, sinigang na isda sa miso, sizzling sisig, baked tahong, inihaw na pusit, chicken barbeque, dami. I was starving kaya nun nandon na, galit- galit na. Busog. Some didn’t make it on time pero sumunod na lng, like si SR and Wilbert. Mas exciting kay wilbert, nakarating sya ng Cavite looking for the place. We waited for him kaya matagal din kame nagstandby at blue wave, tumawag din si Ivy, and talked to everybody, it was a pretty long phone conversation. She never fails to call us, kaya considered present sya every meet ups. Si Peach nagtext hindi na makakasunod, taya n lng daw sya next time. Inannounce yun, and I’m sure everybody remembers that. Twice our number siguro next gimik. Then we decided to bring sis back to the convent. She thanked us for the wonderful dinner. She asked us kung hindi ba raw kami gigimik? Sayang nga lang curfew na nya.  Convoy. With me are Gabs, Iso, Apol and Con. Next stop is Pier One, Timog. Una, Pier One Roxas, but since it's quite far from our place, I suggested na Timog na lng. Rain was pouring hard on the way to pier one, hindi na ko nakasunod sa convoy, pero nakita ko din sila turning left to GMA station na. Matagal din kami bago nakakuha ng table. They ordered buckets of beer, while nagnon-alcoholic drink ako. Mahirap na pauwi. At first walang mapagusapan, but as the hours move on, nalalansing na ang bawat isa (except me) revelations came after. Well some of those ay alam ko na, first hand ako sa mga ganyan. Gabs, earlier, went out for awhile to meet naman his ID friends nearby the area. After one hour lang sya, cause he'll accompany us back home. He's back with RR.  Okay 1am, tinatawagan na ko ni papa, I texted him back that malakas ang ulan. 2am, I am REALLY wanted to be home, pero nagkakainitan na ang usapan, pinayuhan pa ako ni SR ng kung ano-anong dahilan para hindi mapagalitan. 3am I ‘m a dead meat, ngayon ko lang nagawa to be out with the car at these wee hours. But I told them I am ok and that they don't have to worry. Quarter to 4am. Ok I REALLY HAVE TO GO. Nag-uwian na kami. We got the bill and bid our good byes. Si G, naka-two bottles, medyo hilo na, pero kaya pa naman daw, alalayan ko na lng daw sya pababa ng stairs. Con, Apple and Gabs are with me goin home, Iso with Wilbert ( ang "couple for the night" ) Sr with G and Jumbo. Si Eduard at Jo naiwan pa, andun din pala si Greg and Ryan, humabol.  I was a bit nervous driving back home. BAD things popped in my head but Gabs was sharing a kilig story kaya it cleared my head. We finally arrived home past 4am, sandali lang ang biyahe. We took Anonas then Xavierville, scary kase taking the other route. Tulog na si mama, shempre anong oras na?! She opened the gate for us, tahimik It's good Aps and Con slept over, iwas sermon. Pagdating, tulog na agad. Nag-wash up muna ko, dahil sa amoy ng yosi. No talk tulog agad. Tanghali na nagicing. Pinakalate nagicing si Con, akala ko nga may lagnat. Lamigin kse to si Con. Tambay muna, then they left around 4pm.  It was after all a great time with college friends. It was worth the misadventures on the side.  Matagal-tagal na din kaming hindi nagkikita, yun nga lng hindi kami kumpleto. We are planning of  Puerta Galera trip again, before the year ends siguro. Sana matuloy.  Post script: May maliit  na card na sinusulatan ng lahat for their message kay sis. “Sister, We are so blessed to have you in our class. You keep us together, that’s why we love you so much. Happy Birthday! luv, Connie”
