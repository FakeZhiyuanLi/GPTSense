      Well, I am pleased to announce that after my morning jog/walk, I weighed in and found out that I lost 3.5 pounds over the Thanksgiving week!  I didn't lose any bodyfat, but that's okay.  This makes 84.0 pounds and 25% bodyfat lost since my journey of LC started.  I am enjoying the CD's I bought at Circuit City during their Black Friday CD sale.  I bought Josh Groban-Closer, Nick Lachey-SoulO, Freaky Friday Soundtrack, Gilmore Girls Soundtrack, and I Am Sam Soundtrack.  What can I say?  I love soundtracks!  You don't have to buy an artists CD for only one or two songs.

      Whew!  It's hard to believe that it's been a week since I last wrote.  Let me try to catch up.  Firstly, on Sunday, my weigh-in went very well.  I lost 0.5 pounds and 2% bodyfat.  I am glad about that.  I just tomorrow morning is just as forgiving when I weigh-in again.  Last Monday, I had to substitute for my department head, Pat.  His son had something wrong with his ears.  I just hated being away from my family, so, in the afternoon, I brought Debbie and Michael back with me.  They got to see the second-year students.  Now they know what I have to put up with.  Last Tuesday, I took everyone down to Westfield Shoppingtown Independence in Wilmington.  We had a good time.  I also took them to Smithfield's for lunch.  Debbie really missed southern sweet tea.  We affectionately call it "crack tea" since it can have that effect.  Tuesday night was also my last night class until January.  Deb got to see my co-instructor and her husband "up close and personal."  I think Debbie was quite underwhelmed.  My oldest nephew, Michael, surprised me by going jogging twice with me during the week.  I really enjoyed jogging with him and wish we could do it more regularly.  Moreover, I was glad that I jogged twice for at least 30 minutes a clip.  I'm planning on continuing to jog maybe 1/2 as much as I walk.  Wednesday, my other sister Donna and her kids came down from Alexandria.  I was so glad to see her three kids, but especially little Donna.  The kids had a great time playing with each other.  Donna and Michael are close, Jon and Peter loved playing Gamecube, and Krystie loved playing with Sarah.  Wednesday night, we celebrated Christmas.  Everyone opened presents since we were all together.  I took many digital pics.  I gave Mom and Dad money for Christmas.  I was surprised to get a new AT&T phone for my room along with a Kitchen-Aid 5 quart stand mixer.  It's an Artisan, white on white.  I really love it.  I can't remember when during the week it was, but I took Debbie over to the Beirut Memorial.  She had a high school friend who was killed.  We took photos and Deb did a rubbing of his name.  It was very sad, especially since this was the 20 anniversary of the bombing.  The weather was quite appropriate, cloudy and cool.  Thanksgiving went well.  Dad and I worked extremely well together.  Everyone had plenty to eat.  It's amazing that all that preparation culminates in such a quick meal.  The irony isn't lost on me.  This morning, Donna and her kids left at about 6am.  Debbie, Robert and their kids left at little before 7am.  Mom, Dad, and I cleaned up and basically got the house back to normal.  I love for everyone to visit, but I love it even more when the house is quiet after the dust settles.

      It's Saturday afternoon and it feels like this day has already had 40 hours in it!  We're waiting for my sister Debbie and her family to arrive.  I just returned from a 50 minute walk.  Earlier today, I bought myself a new pair of Adidas running shoes.  I also replaced a pair of Sketchers.  I had to break in the Adidas.  I love their shoes.  Today was the 49th Jacksonville Holiday Parade.  It's broadcast on WITN-7 every year.  I hope it was a good parade.  I was too busy making fudge and helping Dad with the yard to watch it.  The weather is so nice today.  It's a cloudless blue sky, low humidity, gentle breezes, and highs in the mid 70s.  I'm glad Mother Nature is giving Debbie and her family nice weather.  We just heard from Debbie.  Their train was an hour late getting into Washington's Union Station.  And then, they stuck them with a Buick Regal (too small).  I just hope they don't get lost or get a ticket.  Robert has been known to speed on occasion.

      Well, it's Friday morning, and only  one day  until Debbie and her clan get here!  I cannot wait!  Whilst watching the weather, I noticed that this weekend will be sunny and in the mid to upper 70s.  That'll be a nice change of pace for anyone accustomed to Chicago weather.  Man, I cannot believe how good  ER  was last night!  I was stunned all hour.  You know, it was kinda anticlimactic to see Dr. Romano crushed by that burning helicopter.  And I got so upset when Dr. Lewis thought her ex Chuck was dead.  Night class went well.  Only one class left on Tuesday.  I did very well considering.  You see, I normally teach my night AutoCAD classes solo, but this semester I had to "team teach" with the new full-time instructor.  There's just something about her that turns me off.  She's SO standoffish.  It's almost like she thinks of teaching as a "9 to 5" gig.  If anything, however, teaching is more than that.  Teachers are there for the students, not for the pay.  I kinda feel bad because instead of doing my morning walk/jog, I'm doing this blog.  I guess you could say that I'm taking a "mini-break" from my exercise.  More than likely, I'll feel bad about it all day, then walk this evening.  That's usually how my mind works.  Mike Meyers was just on  The Today Show .  He is so funny!  I cannot wait to see  The Cat In The Hat .  A plus of the movie is that Sean B. Hayes plays the voice of the fish.  I'll probably take the kids this weekend.  Debbie wants to see  Love Actually , so I might take her to see that.

      Well, my field trip yesterday to New Bern went very well.  I was just happy that Mother Nature didn't send rain or hot temps my way.  First, we took the students to Eastern Building Components.  They make roof and floor trusses.  After that, we went downtown.  We walked around downtown for a bit, then broke into groups for lunch.  I went to  Fred & Claire's Restaurant  with Pat, Eugene, Eddie, and Matteo.  I had the chef's salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  It was very good, and quite reasonably priced.  After lunch, we went to Tryon Palace.  In case you don't know, Tryon Palace was the first permanent capitol of the British colony of North Carolina, and was also the first NC state capitol after independence was declared.  Visit it at: http://www.tryonpalace.org/  We returned to the college in time for me to have night class.  I really didn't feel like teaching last night.  I guess since there are only two classes left, I was "itching" to be done with it.  It might've also just been that I was tired from walking around New Bern.  I ended my evening with an all new episode of Queer Eye For The Straight Guy.  I just love that show.  I feel kinda bad for the poor schlubs they choose.  I mean, I'd love for the "Fab 5" to give my life a makeover, but I couldn't parade my life (such as it is) on television.  Today was SO depressing!  It was windy and rainy with dropping temps.  My only consolation was knowing that Debbie and her family will be here in only 3 days.  Woo Hoo!

      Well, I think I might slip into madness before my sister has a chance to rescue me.  We found out that my dad can't take his vioxx from now until his "scope" next Monday.  It's a whole week away and, already, it's not pretty.  He's got a shorter fuse than normal, and my mom just cannot realize that.  I just hope they don't kill each other.  Either that, or I might just snap and kill them both to save me the aggravation.  Work was the same as always.  While at work, I was listening to http://www.shoutcast.com.  There are a couple of emo channels on there.  Tomorrow, we're taking the kids on a field trip to New Bern.  First, we're going to Eastern Building Components.  They manufacture trusses for construction.  Then, we're going downtown to visit Tryon Palace.  I'll let you know how it goes tomorrow night after night class.  Speaking of Tuesday night, Queer Eye For The Straight Guy is back with new episodes beginning tomorrow.  I just love that show.  I like all of the guys, but Ted (food & wine) is, by far, my favorite.  Both my sister and mother think Kyan (grooming) is the best.  Well, we all have our own tastes.

      Well, after a long 60 minute walk this morning, I weighed-in just like every other Sunday.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that I had lost  3.0  pounds and  2%  bodyfat.  That makes  80.0  pounds lost and  23%  bodyfat lost.  I was quite pleased.

      Well, this afternoon, I went to the movies to see  Looney Tunes: Back In Action .  I had a great time.  The theater was practically empty.  There were some great coming attractions.  The main attraction was vintage Warner Brothers.  It appealed to little kids as well as the adults who grew up on Looney Tunes.  The cameo appearances are not to be missed.  The only negative is that, at times, they is so much to absorb.  I'll have to see it again just to try and catch the sight gags I missed the first time.  Warner Brothers returned to it's roots, thankfully.  I hope the days of  Space Jam  are behind us.  I highly recommend that all Warner Brothers fans run out and see this movie.  Tomorrow, I'm thinking of seeing  Elf .  I have heard from everyone who has seen it that it is hilarious!  I'll have to judge for myself.

      Last night, the HP tech came and put our new  HP DesignJet 500+  plotter together.  It is  SO  cool.  Also last night, I tried to load the necessary plotter software and such on all 21 computers, but to no avail.  My night students had too many questions to do both.  This morning, I got all 21 computers loaded with the drivers.  Now the new plotter is good to go.  My department head, Pat, asked many questions of the computer company, ASA Computers, that was the lowest bidder on our new computers.  They answered them to our satisfaction, so the computer order will go out next Thursday.  I hope to get the new computers before the end of the semester, December 18.  Today, my Dad had an appointment at the VA hospital in Fayetteville.  It was to get the results of his CAT scan.  Last appointment, they detected microscopic amounts of blood in Dad's urine.  The CAT scan showed a tiny stone in his left kidney.  The doctor said that the stone wasn't the cause of the blood.  They scheduled Dad another appointment on Monday, November 24 to get his bladder "scoped."  The doctor wants to see if Dad has a tumor in his bladder.  The doctor told both Dad and Mom that this was nothing to get "worked up over."  Dad and I am taking that advice.  Whatever Mom says to the contrary, I can tell that she's probably going to work herself up into a lather worrying.  I have the utmost confidence that all will be well.

      I cannot express how much I  hate  how the state community college system is screwing with our department.  Wait, let me back track.  I work at the local community college, in the Architectural Technology Department.  Part of my job is to run and maintain the computer lab.  It contains 21 computers.  These computers are going on 5 years old.  In layman's terms, they're  ancient !  Because we're not using the state contractor (IBM) for the new computers, the state requires we send it out as a "closed bid."  This afternoon, they opened the bids.  The company we want to get the computers from, Xi Computers, is 4th on the list of bids.  The three cheaper bids are fly-by-night companies that I've never heard of.  My department head, Pat, is trying to argue that we still need to stick with Xi.  I have the feeling that all he's doing is beating his head against a stone.  More than likely, we'll end up getting the computers from the lowest bidder.  Unfortunately, it will end up costing more because invariably, those companies end up using discontinued and incompatible hardware.  Our software (Architectural Desktop 4, Autodesk VIZ 4, Photoshop, and Premiere) might have conflicts with the hardware.  We've had that happen before.  The good thing is that our new 42" HP plotter was delivered this afternoon.  It is replacing our 24" HP plotter.  The techs are supposed to come tomorrow to set it up and get it connected to the network.  Then we can plot up to 42" wide! Woo Hoo!!

      Today was a beautiful day in southeastern North Carolina.  The sky was azure blue with nary a cloud.  The temps were in the upper 60s-low 70s.  As an added bonus, the humidity was low.  This morning, Dad and I went for an hour-long walk around the neighborhood.  It was very nice.  Mom and I went and did some errands.  While out, I noticed that the inspection for the Grand Marquis was October 2003.  Yikes!  Well, we went to Jiffy Lube post haste.  They did the inspection and an oil change since we were due.  Whew!  I usually catch those kinda things.  It must be "half-timers" disease.  That's when you remember only 50% of what you're supposed to remember.  The neighbors to our left, Robert and Jennifer, had the rest of their pine trees taken out of their back yard.  Boy, the back of our house is now flooded with afternoon sun.  It was really nice.  I can't wait to experience that sun on the first bitterly cold day.  While they were taking the trees out, we had their little black dog, Tyler, in our back yard.  He was running around, marking everything.  When my niece Sarah gets here, she's gonna have a ball playing with him.

      Tomorrow is  Veteran's Day  here in the  US  and  Remembrance Day  in  Canada .  Military holidays always fill me with pride.  Even today is special.  Today is the 228th Birthday of the United States Marine Corps.  My dad, MGySgt Don Heck, gave 28 years to the Corps.  That makes me a "military brat."  I am so very proud of my Dad and all of the other veterans.  Growing up as a military dependent, I was different than my civilian counterparts.  It started with school.  Going to a base school is different than other schools.  In first grade, I had to know my Dad's Social Security Number.  I still know it to this day.  Riding the bus to school was also different.  I rode in either a Navy grey or Marine white bus instead of ordinary yellow.  Once in school, we gathered around the flagpole for the raising of the flag and the Pledge Of Allegiance.  The hardest part, however, was moving from school to school.  It wasn't too bad as long as you were going into another base school.  Transferring to a place without base schools was much worse.  You immediately became an outsider.  Being a "military brat" also had it's privileges.  I got to " see the USA in my Chevrolet ."  I made some great friends.  A few I still keep in touch with.  Turning 10 and getting an ID card was the ultimate for me and other kids.  It gave us the opportunity to go to the 7 Day Store, the pool, and the movies without our parents.  Military kids earn and learn responsibility earlier than civilian kids, IMHO.  Veteran's Day also makes me very sad.  On days like it, I remember back to when I was young.  My Dad was often overseas without us.  Mom would get out Dad's old reel-to-reel and we would make tapes for him.  Talking into the microphone was fun, but it also reminded us that Dad was away for yet another holiday or birthday.  Mom would often get emotional listening to what we said on the tapes.  I imagine Dad also got very emotional.  Even now, Dad still has the laminated photos of my Mom and us that he carried with him overseas.  Dad speaks very little about his times away from us while he was in the Marines.  I know he has it locked away to keep it from hurting us.  I silently thank him for that, but I also wish he had some way of forgetting the harsh memories.  So, tomorrow, please remember.... Veterans: All gave some, but some gave all .

      Well, I weighed-in this morning like usual.  The results are as depressing and dreary as the weather.  I  gained  2 pounds and 2% bodyfat!  I feel like crying.  That drops me to 77 pounds lost and 22% bodyfat lost.  More than likely, I'll just stay in bed and read my Harry Turtledove novel.  Now I'll  definitely  have to go on the  Tic-Tac Diet .

      I was just listening to my  Bette Midler Sings The Rosemary Clooney Songbook , and the song "Sisters" was just on.  I've already chatted a bit about my sister Debbie.  It reminded me to chat some about my other sister, Donna.  Donna is seven years my elder.  Growing up, she was always the legbreaker and bodyguard.  If anyone picked on me, I'd tell Donna and she'd take care of it.  I remember when we first moved into Staff Housing in Cherry Point, NC.  I went out and saw a boy and girl my age (5) standing in the back of a pickup truck on the side of the road.  I went over to say hi and ask if I could play with them.  No sooner did I get out there, the boy took his toy rifle and used the stock to pop me in the eye.  Needless to say, I ran back home crying.  Donna asked why I was crying.  I told her, and she took care of it.  I still don't know what she did or said to the kids, but they never messed with me again.  Donna also took care of the trouble Debbie got into.  Debbie would get into it with another girl not because she was a fighter, but because she new Donna could take care of it!  It's hard to believe Donna is now the mother of three kids and a wife of 20 years.  She's supposed to be bringing the kids down for Thanksgiving.  I can't wait to see them all!  I know Donna thinks Debbie and I are silly because we cackle like hens telling jokes, but I also like talking to Donna about cooking and recipes.  The things I do with Donna are different than the things I do with Debbie.  Why, who else but Donna taught me to enjoy Beefaroni and French dressing on my salad.  I remember that Donna had classic "middle child" syndrome.  She even tried to say she thought she was adopted!  Unfortunately, one look and both my Dad and Donna is more than enough proof that she isn't adopted.  I love Donna so much, despite the fact that she smokes and listens to country music!  LOL

      MMMM.......I just love autumn afternoons and evenings.  I just got back from a 45 minute walk.  A cold front came through last night.  Today we were mostly cloudy, cool, and breezy.  Our morning high was 67 and the temps fell from there.  At 3:30, it was down to 57.  While I was walking, I could smell the damp leaves and smoke from people's chimneys.  I love that burning smell.  It always makes me smile.  Also, the damp, musky smell of wet leaves reminds me of Virginia Beach, where I grew up.  Of all the seasons, autumn is my very favorite.  Earlier today, I went "scooter-poopin" with Mom.  We went to Target where I bought the new Harry Connick, Jr. Christmas CD.  Mom got some more candles and four packages of Halloween Peeps (90% off).  We also went to the Dollar Tree to get votives, Office Max to get Mom's 2004 daily diary, and Books-A-Million.  I could spend countless hours in bookstores.  I bought the new Harry Turtledove novel,  In The Presence Of Mine Enemies .  It's an alternative history.  I am a fanatic of the genre.  I also got a  Queer Eye For The Straight Guy  calendar and a 2004 Cancer horoscope book for Mom.  Tomorrow is my weigh-in.  I always dread Sundays for that reason.  On Saturdays, I basically fast and kvetch.  I worry that I haven't been "good enough" and ponder what I can do, in one day, to redeem myself.  Yes, I know that I'm crazy!  Add that to my myriad of other disorders.

      Oh, this morning, I was so mad!  You see, most mornings I walk before breakfast.  I try to walk about my neighborhood for 30-45 minutes.  It's something that helps me lose weight and it gives me time to think.  I usually walk with a walkman.  My pace is brisk, but not that of those hip cracking speed-walkers (not that there's anything wrong with that).  Let's just say that my pace is fast enough to keep my shins burning.  Anyhoo, this morning I encountered 2 loose dogs on my walk.  I do not carry a stick or anything else.  I'm seriously considering carrying pepper spray.  There are about 3 dogs that are constantly loose.  They usually stay close to their respective homes.  Now, I'm not sure if the dogs get themselves out of their back yards, or if their owners set them loose.  All I know is that I am often startled out of my reverie by barking dogs.  Luckily, I've never been bitten and I pray I never am.  As a former dog owner, I abhor hurting a dog.  But more importantly, I hate these delinquent dog owners.  They are forcing me and other walkers to take actions against their pets.  Whew, that felt good to rant about.

      Hey there.  Just thought I'd chat a little about myself.  Sorry I didn't post anything last night, but I had to teach night class.  You see, I work at the local community college in the Architectural Technology Department.  I teach part-time and run the CAD lab.  I've worked there ever since graduating.  Last night, I was teaching "Intro to AutoCAD."  We are using Architectural Desktop 3.3.  I love teaching AutoCAD.  I've used AutoCAD since Release 9 (way back in 1990).  Okay, more about me.  I know this might come as a shock to some of you, but I'm gay.  I know, I know, you're saying to yourself, "Donnie can't be gay!  He's so butch and manly!"  My reply to those people is, "Excuse me Mr. Magoo, but you might want to replace the batteries in your BellTone and get a stronger eyeglass prescription."  Another revelation about me is that I've been battling my weight for as long as I can remember.  Happily, I've lost 79.0 pounds and 22% bodyfat since 10/27/02.  I've been doing Low-Carb (LC).  I kinda took the best from the multitude of low-carb diets out there.  I weigh-in every Sunday morning.  I have the coolest torture device.  It's a Tanita bodyfat scale.  Oh, how I loathe it!!  Right now, I've kinda hit a plateau.  I've been thinking of doing RuPaul's "Tic-Tac Diet."  For breakfast, a tic-tac; for lunch, a tic-tac; for dinner, a glass of water - no tic-tac.  Right now, I'm writing this blog whilst I'm listening to the "eclectic XL" station on Radio@NetscapePlus.  I love listening to it at work and at home.  So please, try it for yourself!  Now, that didn't sound too much like I'm a shill for "the man."

      I have two older sisters.  This post is about my eldest sister, Debbie.  She is the one who has a blog and urged me to start  blogging .  We'll chat about my other sister, Donna, a little bit later. Debbie and I are symbiotes.  We're ying-and-yang.  Even though nine years separate us, we act like twins.  Debbie is my sanity lifeline, and I am hers.  So, expect to hear about her and her life in Chicago. After reading the previous paragraph, I chuckled because it reminded me of the old  Patty Duke Show  song.   "Oh they're cousins, identical cousins..."  Another thing you'll notice after reading my blog is that I always refer back to movies, TV, cartoons, and music.  My head is crammed with the minutiae of life lived since the beginning of the 1970s. What were we chatting about?  Ah yes, my "Debbie Doo."  That's what I used to call Deb when I was small.  Even now, if I want to make her weepy, all I have to do is send a mushy Hallmark card addressed to "Debbie Doo."  Both Debbie and I are suckers for "weepy."  Every once in a while, I'll drag out the videotapes of "The Bells Of Saint Mary's" or "The Electric Grandmother" so I can have a good cry.  Not to be outdone, Deb will watch "Little House On The Prairie" and blubber ( Pa, I can't see, Pa! ).

      This is what I hate about being off from work.  I suddenly forget what day it is.  My days are associated with my teaching schedule.  Funny, isn't it?  After a nice jog this morning, Mom and I were once again out and about.  We both got haircuts at the local  Fantastic Sam's .  Rhonda squeezed us in during a perm.  She's one of the only hairdressers who apologizes when she nicks my mole on my neck.  I told her not to worry about it since she was talking to the lady from Sally's Beauty Supplies.  Try as I might, I relented and went to  Wally World .  We grabbed some liquid potpourri and browsed the grocery section.  In honor of the impending new year, they had a whole aisle display for low-carb foods, et al.  It's nice to see them cater to us LC customers, but I fear this is merely for the new year and the resolutions that follow.  I bought some  Atkins  low-carb spaghetti.  We just finished dinner (spaghetti and meatballs) and I'm not a big fan of  Atkins  pasta.  I think  Keto  makes a better pasta product.  After the bank (to cash Mom's check) we went by  Circuit City .  Since I have new media towers, it's time to get more music.  Mom got an Irish music CD, and I got 3 CDs:  Joseph Arthur  -  Redemption's Son   Steve Burns  -  Songsfordustmites   Death Cab For Cutie  -  Transatlanticism  They're all very good.  I commend my research and purchases.  In case you're wondering, yes, that is the same Steve Burns that once hosted  Blue's Clues .  No, his CD is not for kids, but for their parents.  I put together my second media tower.  Believe it or not, but all of my CDs, 45s, and cassettes just fit.  I might have room for maybe 20 more CDs.  Yes, I know that I'm a music junkie, but that's one addiction I can live with!

      After sleeping in until about 8am, I got up and worked on a puzzle Mom started yesterday.  Once Mom got up, I showered, and we did all of the errands we had to do today.  After stopping at the ATM to get cash, I went to  Office Max  and bought two 20"x60" media towers.  They were on sale and I am in dire need of someplace nice to place my ever-expanding collection of music.  Then, we went to Target.  There, I bought a CD from  Something Corporate  and a  Memorex  CD boombox for work.  My old CD boombox is about 6 years old and it's been dropped numerous times.  Besides, since I keep it in the drafting class, the students have wrecked it.  This new one will be in the drafting class while I'm there, but in my office when I'm not.  Once I came home, I put together one of the media towers.  It looks so much better than what I used to have.  Tomorrow I'm going to out together the other one.  Then my computer room will be less cluttered.  Whew!  We called the  Mercury  dealer this afternoon.  The service manager said the part came in AND the  Ford Corporation  will cover the repairs under the warranty.  Whoopee!!  Since they're shorthanded this week, the appointment is for Monday morning.

      After a 45 minute jog around the neighborhood, I came back and weighed in.  I gained 1.5 pounds but stayed the same on bodyfat.  So basically, I'm in the same spot I was on 12/14/03.  Jeeze, I'm gonna get whiplash from all this back-and-forth.  In an obsessive-compulsive mind, I alphabetized my CD collection after putting away the Christmas CDs.  I have quite a few CDs.  Not much else is going on.  I'm listening to an mp3 mix CD that my sister Debbie made me.  That reminds me of making "mix tapes" back in the 80s.  Memories...

      Boy, today was a lazy day!  I didn't do much of anything.  Mom did our usual grocery shopping and the like.  We finished a 1000 piece puzzle and just vegetated.  Yesterday afternoon, I went to see "Cheaper By The Dozen."  I love both Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt.  And having Tom Welling in it was just the icing on the cake.  He's SO dreamy.  I should be married to that tall, dark, hunky man with size 14 feet!  WOO HOO!  Ok, now I've got to think about something boring and mundane.  What, you said think about my life?  Done, and done.  With the leftover turkey, I made a yummy casserole for dinner last night.  I'm usually not jazzed about swiss cheese, but it was good.  Tonight was just hot dogs, sausages, kraut, and chili.  The 'Rents also had seasoned fries.  Right now I'm listening to the "Adult Alternative" station at www.launch.com

      Happiest of holidays to everyone!  Last night, Mom and I stayed up and watched Midnight Mass From St. Peter's Basilica.  Every time I see Pope John Paul II, I can see his slow decline in health.  It makes me so sad to know that he is trapped in his failing body.  Today was really quiet.  Our Christmas was when the kids were here at Thanksgiving.  The main excitement was that we took all of the holiday decorations down.  The living room looks so much larger now that the tree is down.  Now the house is back to normal.  Afterwards, Dad and I went for a long walk.  It was extremely quiet and peaceful.  We walked down to the new subdivision off of Corbin.  It will be nice once our two subdivisions are connected through more than just one street.  Today was the initial test of Dad's new deep fryer.  We fried a 22 pound turkey in it.  It was relatively easy and very good.  The only bad thing was the length of time it took to bring the oil up to temp.  Not much else is going on.  I'll probably go to bed early.  Tomorrow, I might go to see a movie.

      Since today is Christmas Eve, and since I didn't have much else to do today, I decided to cook a pumpkin pie.  But not any pumpkin pie. . . a low-carb pie.  I tried a recipe called  "Pumpkin Pie with Pecan Praline Crust"  from a cookbook written by Dana Carpender entitled  500 Low-Carb Recipes .  After dinner tonight, I tried it.  It was a slice of heaven!  You'd never guess that it had only 10 grams of "effective carbs."  Dad tried a slice and said it was good, even though we didn't have Cool-Whip to go on top.  While making my pie, I got to use my Kitchenaid mixer for the first time.  It was a JOY to use.  Mom was amazed at how quiet it was.  I was amazed at how powerful it was.  Another plus was that it was a snap to clean.  Not much else going on.  All three of us were home today.  I can hardly contain my joy.  Dad put a large dent into his weekly beer supply.  On days like today, I feel like I've been beating my head on a rock.  Oh well.....

      I just returned from a nice jog.  The forecasters say we're supposed to get up to the upper 60s.  I believe it.  For my jog, I wore Nike Shorts, a tshirt and a hoodie.  When I was done, I was drenched!  It's already in the upper 50s.  Bright and early this morning, we had an appointment at the local Mercury dealer.  If you remember, the car makes a high-pitched whistle or squeal when the heater is turned off and you continue driving.  Very annoying.  Well, they finally duplicated the noise at the dealer and think it's the motor that controls the vacuum between our heat & a/c.  The service manager says the part is only about $20, but the labor will be expensive, since they'll have to remove the whole dash.  It will also take all day.  Since we were in there before passing 36,000 miles and since we are just past 36,000 miles, he has to get an approval from Ford before they'll cover it under warranty.  Unfortunately, the woman who does that is on vacation until Monday.  So, once the part and authorization comes, they should fix the Mercury sometime next week.  Whew!!  Not much else going on.  I need to take another shower now cuz I'm stinky and sweaty from my jog.

      Starting yesterday, and only in the Sunday comics, Berkeley Breathed's new comic strip  "Opus"  debuted.  Not surprisingly, our podunk paper isn't carrying it!  I'll have to dash down to Books-A-Million to see if they have a copy of yesterday's Washington Post.  I just adore Opus!  He was me, immortilized in pen and ink.  I have all of the Bloom County and Outland books.  Hell, my sister even gave me a copy of  "A Wish for Wings That Work."   I only wish that I videotaped the TV special the  ONE  Christmas it was aired.

      Well, we just finished with dinner.  We had a pork roast, kraut, gravy, lima beans, and cauliflower.  I had everything except the lima beans (too many carbs).  It was very good!  Earlier this afternoon, Mom and I went to the movies to see "Something's Gotta Give."  It was a very funny movie.  It reminded me of how much I enjoy Diane Keaton.  Plus, I got to drool over Keanu Reeves as a doctor.

      After a nice jog in the crisp, cold morning air, I weighed-in.  I lost 1.5 pounds and 5% bodyfat.  That makes 86.5 pounds lost and 26% bodyfat lost total.  My low carb fudge is very good, IMHO.  Dad also thinks it's very good.  I even gave Fred, a neighbor 2 doors down, a piece and he liked it.  Mom's response was, "Gee, it tastes like peanut butter."  Granted, it has low-sugar peanut butter in it, but it's not supposed to be peanut butter fudge.  Oh well, I like it!  And besides, what do you expect from fudge with only 1.8 carbs per piece?

      This morning, we had a few snow flurries.  That's a big deal here in southeastern North Carolina.  It didn't last long, but was nice while it lasted.  I tried to take the Grand Marquis to the dealer to be serviced, but their service department isn't open on Saturdays.  You see, after I turn off the heater or defroster, a high pitched squeal is heard.  It's really annoying.  It stops after the car is turned off.  Monday morning, I'm taking it in to get it checked.  Personally, I could live without heat, but Mom likes her heat.  We also heard that our neighbor across the street, Bob, was admitted to Onslow Memorial Hospital yesterday.  His one leg was so swollen that it was hard to the touch.  He's supposed to have an MRI to see if he has any blockages.  I hope all goes well.  This afternoon, Dad and I went for a short walk.  I had intended to go for a long walk, but Dad kept saying how cold the wind was, so we called it quits after 30 minutes.  Tomorrow morning, before I weigh-in, I'm going to go jogging regardless of the temperatures.

      Yesterday afternoon, I got a call from Pat, my department head.  He asked me if I wanted to teach day classes in addition to my night classes next semester.  I said, "Hell yeah, what happened?"  He told me that the other instructor quit, and that they needed someone to pick up the slack.  I agreed.  This morning, I went into work to pick up the books and stuff that I'd need to get ready for the new semester.  Everyone thanked me for stepping in.  I even saw the "outgoing" instructor in her (now my) office.  I said, "Sorry, just need to get these two books."  She replied wanly, "Good luck."  She was only there today to turn in her grades.  Nothing like waiting until the last minute.  They were due by 10:00 am.  After doing some errands, I made Mom a fire.  She loves them.  I had to admit, when we had about 10 minutes of snow flurries this afternoon, I liked it too.  I tried a new recipe for Low Carb Fudge.  It was one without cream cheese, thankfully.  IMHO, the ones with cream cheese just taste like chocolate cream cheese bites.

      Yesterday, I brought all of my gifts into work.  I also brought cookies and chocolate coins for the students.  I had my hands full yesterday afternoon.  The impending end of the semester means tallying up students lab hours and the requisite paperwork.  I also began burning CD's containing the students stuff.  Over the semester break, our old computers will be taken out and our new computers will be brought in.  So, I have to make sure everything important is copied off the old computers.  I can't wait to get the new computers!!  Today, I brought in  Hazelnut Mocha Fudge  for the office.  Everyone loved it and clamored for the recipe.  Since it is SO simple, I recited it for them.  Here is the recipe for you:  Ingredients  - 3 cups  Hershey's  semi-sweet baking chips - 1 (14-ounce) can  Eagle Brand  sweetened condensed milk (not evaporated milk) - dash salt - 1 teaspoon  DaVinci  sugar free hazelnut syrup - 1 heaping teaspoon  Folgers  coffee crystals  Instructions  - In a heavy saucepan, over medium heat, melt chips with condensed milk and salt. - Remove from heat; stir in syrup and coffee. - Spread evenly into foil-lined 8- or 9-inch square pan.  Chill 2 hours or until firm. - Turn fudge onto cutting board; peel off foil and cut into squares. - Store in ziplock bag in fridge.

      It began raining last night during  SNL , and it's still raining!  I hate rainy weather.  I especially hate cold, rainy weather.  Needless to say, I didn't get a chance to walk/jog this morning before weighing-in.  Fortunately, I lost 0.5 pounds.  Unfortunately, it says I gained 3% bodyfat.  It baffles me sometimes!  Not much else going on today.  It seems like most of the television channels are devoting 100% of their day's schedule to the news that Saddam was captured alive in Iraq.  HoHum!  Maybe I'll take the $10 gift card I got from one of my students up to  Blockbuster  and see about renting a DVD or two.

      Yes, my  Advocate  magazine woes are, seemingly, gone.  In two weeks I'll know for sure.  This morning, while in Sam's Club, Dad and I got Mom a DVD player for the den.  It's a Kawai and it was only $55.  I went to Circuit City to get an S-video cable, and was shocked to pay $40 for it.  Who would've thought the cable would cost that much.  Once we got it hooked up, I gave Mom a lesson on watching DVDs and listening to CDs on it.  Then, while she was listening to a Dennis Day CD, Dad and I went to Suncoast Video and I bought Mom  The Thin Man  on DVD.  I really wanted to get  Charlie Chan , but they didn't have any of them.  Not much else is going on.  Last night, I was kinda down.  This time of year always makes me miss my Gramma and my dog.  More than likely, I'll watch  The Bells of St Mary's  and  The Sound of Music , which will make me cry and cry.  I know, I'm a glutton for punishment!

      What is it about magazines?  I'm a subscriber of  The Advocate  and  Out  magazines.  They are both LPI magazines.  Well, about a month ago, I renewed my subscriptions, plus added free subscriptions for my sister Debbie.  Two days this week, I received 2 copies of The Advocate.  Of course, there isn't a phone number to call to rectify the situation.  There was just the website.  I went and logged in.  I emailed them telling them I was receiving duplicate copies.  I didn't hear anything from them, so I went back to the site and changed the mailing address for the secondary subscription.  I hope Debbie starts to receive it soon.

      I must confess!  I have a guilty pleasure.  It is bodybuilders.  I just love bodybuilders!  I especially love bodybuilders who look almost morphed.  Some favorites are: Lee Priest, Eddie Moyzan, Brett & Kraig Feldman, and Bruce Patterson.  Here are some good links:  urlLink Teen Muscle Guys   urlLink Bodybuilders, Inc.   urlLink Bruce Patterson   urlLink Lee Priest   urlLink Brett Feldman   urlLink Repetrope Men's Videos   I also admit to reading muscle growth stories.  Reading about a regular guy who magically turns into a huge bodybuilder is a great distraction.  Some great sites to visit are:  urlLink Muscle Growth Stories   urlLink Muscle Growth Stories at Yahoo Groups   urlLink Metabods   I know a lot of you won't care or understand my "guilty pleasures."  That's okay.  I'm not forcing anyone to visit any of the above links.  It's just, if you want to browse, feel free.  I promise I won't tell anyone! ;-)

      It was raining this morning when I awoke, so I decided not to walk/jog.  Because of a cold front coming through, we were quite breezy.  I had to bring in the flags and put down all of the lawn stuff that could possibly blow away.  I feel for those families that have already decorated their exteriors with lights and figures.  Maybe they won't blow down.  After dinner, in the middle of the deluge, Mom and I went to Wally World.  God knows, Mom needs her holiday yarn, no matter the weather.  We were both soaked to the bone by the time we returned home.  I don't know if it was the weather, or just my mood, but while showering, I was feeling very melancholy.  I was imagining that nobody (save my family) will love me.  I'm going to be one of those elderly, confirmed southern bachelors.  Ok, enough wallowing in self-pity.  Now I'll return to my walled psychological fortress.

      I'm not quite certain, but last night I think a girl flirted with me.  Let me try to explain.  You see, normally, I am 100% oblivious to flirting since people never flirt with me.  And plus, being a gay man, you don't expect it from a woman.  Well, I had taken Mom to Wally World to get replacement bulbs for the tree and plastic canvas.  We were checking out in the "Lawn & Garden" department, and a black girl said, "You look familiar, I think you know my sister ________ ."  I replied, "Yeah, how's she doing?"  We chit chatted a minute or two, then she said, "You're looking good, and you have great skin."  I was kinda taken aback.  I think I said something about my large pores and let it drop.  Then we left the store.  Now, if only a hunky guy was flirting with me!!  Oh well.  All day at work, I kept forgetting what day of the week it was.  I SO hate when that happens.  Then, when I was leaving, I had forgotten that I had parked in the staff parking behind the building instead of next to the building, as usual.  I'm just glad I made it back home without any weird incidents.

      Today started like every other Monday.  Once I went to work, however, all things changed.  As I walked into the CAD Lab, I saw three hampers filled with men's clothes.  I mean, all kinds of clothes...underwear, socks, bathing suits, shorts, pants, shirts, sweaters, and shoes.  I was dumbfounded!  Apparently, a student went through his closet, and decided to bring in all of the clothes he either didn't like or couldn't wear anymore.  He asked, "Hey Donnie, you want some clothes?"  I replied, "No thanks, I have plenty of clothes various sizes."  The amazing thing though, there were students rummaging through and taking stuff.  When I stopped home for lunch, Debbie called to talk to Mom.  She was all upset and crying.  She feels like she's in between a rock and a hard place.  They're having money troubles, and she feels like it's all her fault.  I feel so helpless when she's upset and crying.  I feel like I can't do anything to make it better for her.  I tried to make her laugh, but I don't know if I helped ease her anxiety.

      This morning, after Dad and I returned from our walk, I weighed-in.  I lost 0.5 pounds and gained 1% bodyfat.  Don't ask me to explain that anomaly.  I'm just pleased with the weight loss.  I didn't do much else today.  I did go to Target and get Christmas gifts for the guys at work.  I hope they like them.  I still have to wrap them.  I'll probably bring them in next Tuesday since that is the last day for "block schedule students."  On that Monday, I'm bringing in Christmas cookies for both the first- and second-year students.

      Last night, since there wasn't much going on, I went to the movies.  Despite what the critics have said, I went to see  The Cat In The Hat .  I really enjoyed it, despite the gaggle of Jr High/High School kids in the back.  Alec Baldwin was a sheer delight.  I returned home just in time to see a great new episode of  Life With Bonnie .  I love that show, but wish they would've explained why they wrote off the daughter.  Today, after going to the commissary, the package store, and Sam's Club, I took Mom to see  The Missing .  Normally, Dad goes in for westerns, but since he thinks all movies are "too damn loud", we went alone.  Mom wanted to see it because it was scary.  Surprisingly, I also enjoyed it.  Boy, empty movie theaters are the best way to see a movie!  I need to go walking/jogging.  I didn't get to yesterday since I substituted.  I'll go in about 30-45 minutes.  I just ate dinner (hot dogs and brats for me...fries for everyone else) and don't want to ralph!

      After a long, monotonous day willed with cloudy skies and rain, I decided to take in a movie.  Since I didn't get a chance to go see "Love Actually" with my sister while she was here, I took myself after dinner.  It was a great movie!  Please visit the website http://www.loveactually.com/  It was the perfect balance of happiness and sadness.  Everyone should go see it.  Tomorrow I have to substitute for Pat.  It's not too bad.  I'll basically just have to be there to make sure the students don't burn the place down.  They're pretty much on auto-pilot since they're working on their projects.

      Geeze, I went into work today, and you would've thought that I usually dress like a hobo.  All of the students said, "Boy Donnie, why are you all dressed up?"  I mean, I had my black leather car coat, a grey Cremeaux dress shirt, black Savane pants, a black Grinch tie, black socks, and my new black Sketcher shoes on.  Admittedly, I was a tad monochromatic, but not any more dressed up.  I think it was the coat.  Today was cold enough for me to wear my coat.  It might've also been that I didn't have my sleeves turned up per usual.  I just got finished making ham salad.  There were three slices of ham left from Thanksgiving, so I thought I'd turn it into salad.  Dad enjoyed my turkey salad, so I thought he'd like this too.  I tried it and must say, it is damn fine!  I just hate the fact that I can't have it on rye or pumpernickle bread.  Of everything I've given up for my Low Carb, bread is the hardest.  Queer Eye was really good last night.  The preview for next Tuesday, however, alludes to a "must see" episode.  It deals with a former marine getting a makeover!  Color me there!  It's supposed to be rainy tomorrow.  I hope it holds off until after I exercise in the morning.  I feel bad when I have to miss my morning exercise.

      Today was my return to work after being off Thanksgiving week.  I was glad to get back.  On the plus side, I don't have to teach anymore night classes for the rest of the year.  The bad thing is that I won't be getting the extra money from night classes.  It's all a trade-off, I guess.  Right now, I'm listening to the radio.  One of the local radio stations,  102.7 WGNI , is playing nothing but holiday music until the end of the holidays.  They have a great collection of eclectic music.  I wish they streamed on the internet so everyone could enjoy it with me!  Today, I wore a new outfit to work.  I wore the new navy oxford I got at Old Navy yesterday, a pair of the khaki pants I got for "Christmas", my new Sketchers dress shoes, and a SpongeBob tie that Daniel got me last year.  Everyone at work liked the outfit.  Speaking of Daniel, I hope he's doing well.  I haven't heard from him since Halloween.

      Sorry I've been remiss in blogging.  I'm just now regaining my voice.  Wednesday and Thursday was a joy teaching with such a raspy voice.  Last night, I had two new students enter my Intro to AutoCAD class.  That makes 15 students in my night class.  I've never had a night class so full.  I feel bad that I've been slack on my exercising this week.  I would've exercised more, but I felt lousy all week.  I hope my slackness doesn't reflect on Sunday's weigh-in.  We'll see!

      Well, to listen to me this morning, you'd think that I spent last night singing in a smoky lounge.  I'm very breathy!  My "sinus thing" has evidently moved into my throat.  It's funny, but my throat doesn't hurt, I just sound very raspy.  Last night was also my first night class.  I had 13 students enter my "Intro To AutoCAD" class.  Funny this is, my voice wasn't too bad until the end of class last night.  It must've been from all that hot air!  I'm taking it easy today.  My morning class had to work on their floor plans with as little vocal assistance as possible.  Afterwards, I came home and have been drinking hot liquids like coffee and tea to soothe my voice.

      Yep, the college cancelled day classes once again.  I only hope that tonight's night classes go on as scheduled.  Tonight is the start of my Tuesday-Thursday night class.  I really cannot fathom the reason why day classes were cancelled and not just delayed.  I'm getting over a sinus thing.  For the past couple of days, I've had congestion and post-nasal drip.  It's convenient that I've been sick during my "involuntary vacation."

      Late last evening, while watching  The Golden Globe Awards , I found out that the college would be closed today (Monday 1/26).  Yesterday and last night, North Carolina was hit with a winter storm.  We got mostly freezing rain and ice.  Other parts of the state received upwards of 4" of snow.  So, once again, the  "powers that be"  cancelled classes.  I'll tell you one thing, I'm still going to Chicago for Spring Break!  I don't care if they have classes or not!  Since I had the day off, I went to H&R Block and had my state and federal taxes done.  It was virtually painless.  Now I'll be awaiting my refunds.  I think I'll also go get my haircut today.  Then I will be clean cut for the start of my night classes tomorrow night.

      When I awoke, I found the sky a steely gray and the air very cold.  Not wishing to go jogging right after waking up, I waited until after returning from Sam's Club.  After jogging for about 35 minutes, I weighed in.  I stayed the same both weight and bodyfat.  That's 89.5 pounds and 25% bodyfat lost.  Forecasters are predicted wintery weather for the region.  I think we'll just get a cold rain.  Areas west and north of us should get a snow, sleet, rain mix.  I just don't want anything to mess up class tomorrow.  Tonight is the Golden Globe Awards.  They are very entertaining and less stuffy than the Oscars.

      It gives me great pain and sadness to report that  Bob Keeshan , also known as  Captain Kangaroo , passed away today at the age of 76.  A large portion of my early childhood development came from watching  Captain Kangaroo ,  Sesame Street , and  The Electric Company .  Even as I write this, I am weepy eyed.  In one swift blow, an educator to millions of children is gone.  Whether he was playing Clarabell The Clown on the  Howdy Doody Show  or Captain Kangaroo on his own show, Bob gently led generations of children down the road to education.  My condolences go out to his family.

      This evening after dinner, I bought my plane ticket to Chicago.  My annual Spring Break trip to visit my sister and her family is coming up the week of March 15-19.  Yes, that's right, I'll be in Chicago for St. Patrick's Day!  There's no better place to visit then, save Ireland.  Work was routine.  I've been showing Matteo, one of my second-year students, the ropes of being the computer lab assistant.  Since I had to take over Anna's classes, someone had to take over for me.  Pat and I both thought Matteo would be perfect.

      Today, I didn't want to get out of bed.  I was so warm under my covers, and 6:00am came with a vengeance.  Work was good.  Thankfully, it was one of my short days.  When I came home, Mom and I did some errands.  Afterwards, I was so sleepy sitting in Dad's recliner.  I didn't succumb, however.  I got off my ass and went jogging for about 30-35 minutes.  Not much else going on today besides the 40th Birthday of my sister Donna.  Jeeze, it seems like only yesterday we were all living in Va. Beach in Little Creek Housing.  Was that really over twenty years ago??  I can almost hear  "Sunrise, Sunset"  playing in my head.

      A cold front came through and brought back the cold temperatures.  I went back to work today.  My department head, Pat, was out sick today.  Evidently, everyone in his house is down with a nasty bug.  I hope he feels better soon.  A graduate substituted for his class.  One of my second-year students gave me wonderful news!  On Sunday, he and his family ate at RuckerJohn's.  He was surprised to see the former instructor there working as part of the waitstaff.  I thanked him for making my week.  I was very pleased to read about our Senator John Edwards earning second place in the Iowa caucus.  I hope he continues to do well.  I'm just hoping he gets the VP place on the Democratic ticket.  At this point, I'll take ANYONE but Bush!

      Today was a quiet one.  We grilled out for dinner (marinated steaks).  Dad and I walked for about 50 minutes.  I made a new Valentine's Day wreath for the front door.  It turned out very nice.  I'm thinking of making others for St. Patrick's Day and Easter.  I was very "crafty."  I had to go to Target this evening.  My TV remote died for the computer room television.  I bought a universal remote to power both the TV and VCR.  It works like a dream.  While at Target, I bought myself three CD's.  I got:  Various Artists - Punk Goes Acoustic Finger Eleven - Finger Eleven Howie Day - Stop All The World Now  Right now I'm listening to the Punk Goes Acoustic.  It is "wicked good."  I wonder if any relatives want me to burn them copies?

      Just finished having dinner.  My meatza went over very well.  Both Mom and Dad liked it.  They said they didn't miss the traditional crust.  I loved it!  It satiated my craving for pizza.  I will definitely make this again.  Before dinner, Dad and I took a short walk.  It wasn't very long since it looked like it would pour any minute.

      This morning I was amazed at how warm it was when I went for my pre-weigh-in jog.  It was drizzly and in the low 60s.  When I weighed-in, I was astounded to find that I had lost 3 pounds and 3% bodyfat.  That makes 89.5 pounds lost thus far!  Yesterday, Dad and I walked for just over one hour.  Mom and I went to Blockbuster and rented three DVDs.  Mom and Dad watched Jackie Chan in "The Medallion.:  Afterwards, we watched Heath Ledger in "The Order."  It was quite good.  Somewhat of an intellectual thriller.  Not much else going on.  I'm contemplating going to the movies this afternoon.  Either that, or I'll make a new Valentine door wreath.  Mom and I just returned from Michael's with all the supplies to make a new one for the front door.  It's also time for me to fix up the one my sister Debbie made for us.  That one is almost faded completely white.  Tonight for dinner I'm trying a new low-carb meal..."Meatza."  It's basically a pizza with a ground beef crust.  I plan on topping it with mushrooms and green peppers.  Topping it with meat would kinda be redundant, don't ya think?

      Today was a great day.  The main reason was because it was Friday.  The second reason is because I have a three-day weekend because of MLK Day.  I do, however, need to grade some drawings and prepare for Tuesday's classes.  Not too shabby.  After coming home from work today, Mom and I went to Sam's Club.  I had to get more of my "fat pills."  The Hydroxycut there is less expensive than in GNC.  Afterwards, we went to Books-A-Million.  I bought a new paperback by Robert Conroy called "1901."  It's an alternative history.  I got Mom her monthly horoscope magazine.  At checkout, I was chastised into renewing my discount card.  I brought some raspberry mocha fudge in to work today.  The kids loved it, but said that they really couldn't taste the raspberry syrup.  Next time I'll have to add more.   Now I'm waiting for dinner.  I'm making roasted chicken, veggies, gravy, and boiled potatoes for Mom and Dad.

      Yes, I realize that I've been delinquent in my "blogging" duties.  Please forgive me.  Work is keeping me quite busy.  That, and the fact that my life is quite uneventful.  The past few days, my two classrooms have been as warm as the 9th level of hell!  Complaining seems to be all for naught.  I actually had a trickle of sweat run down my spine this afternoon during Codes class.  Speaking of students, I have one first-year student who just rubs me the wrong way.  He's a boy right out of High School who thinks he already knows everything there is to know about this curriculum.  He is a smart-ass who is quite flippant.  I'm just biding my time until I can send him a drop notice for excessive absences.  Is that SO wrong?  I'm thinking I'll make some mocha hazelnut fudge for class tomorrow.  Either that or raspberry fudge.  Who knows...

      Today I went back to work after our "no snow" snow day.  I don't yet know how the college plans on making up Friday.  It was nice and warm today.  It got up to about 62.  After I got off from work, I went for a 30 minute jog.  I felt SO good afterwards.  During my office hours, I played with the new version of Architectural Desktop (ADT 2004).  It will be a while until I get used to it.  I've been a lifelong "pulldown" and "toolbar" user.  With ADT 2004, a lot of things have moved to "tool palettes."  After dinner, I need to prepare for Tuesdays classes.  For Presentation class, we're going to begin one-point perspectives.  In Codes class, we're beginning the Building Codes Illustrated book.

      Well, I'm lucky I'm not a popsicle!  Last night, at about 10:50pm, I heard a loud boom, then the lights went out.  Apparently a transformer blew.  The lights were out on our street from Pebble Lane to Wisteria Drive.  The lights came back on at about 12:40.  Believe me, it got pretty damn chilly in the house.  This morning, since it was 24 degrees when I got up, I decided not to jog.  I didn't want any part of me freezing and falling off.  I weighed-in before my shower.  I didn't lose or gain any weight.  The scale did say that I supposedly gained 4% bodyfat.  I'm thinking that was because I didn't jog beforehand.  That's my theory and I'm sticking with it!  Later on when it warms up, I'll probably either go walking with Dad or jogging alone.

      Well, I awoke this morning at 6am to find out that the college was closed due to inclement weather.  Unfortunately, there wasn't any such weather to speak of.  There have been some flurries, but no accumulation.  I hate it when the college jumps the gun and cancels classes.  It also seems like whatever the local school district decides, the college tows the same line.  I just hope that the college doesn't take any of our spring break away to make up today's snow day.

      This morning, while I was in my morning class (Architectural Presentations) with the second-year students, Pat found out that the new computers had arrived.  He made his students disconnect and remove the old computers.  The computer techs brought in the new computers.  After my morning class, Pat and I helped Dom (one of the computer techs) hook up and install stuff on the new computers.  They are  SO  fast and sleek.  I love them!  Tomorrow, we're supposed to have " wintery weather ."  I hope it doesn't start until after 12 noon.  I'll be done with classes then.  I hate it when classes are cancelled and I have to make them up.  This afternoon was my first Building Codes class.  It wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be.  Still, 4 hours a week is about 2 hours too much (LOL)!

      Well, this morning was my first day back to work.  Today was officially called "workforce development."  Tomorrow is the beginning of classes.  I am teaching three day classes and one night class.  Whew, what a load!  When I went into work, they moved the office I was to be in.  Since they're doing geothermal heating systems in other buildings, they moved an office over to Anna's old office.  Now I'm across the way.  I have a new phone number and everything.  I also spent the majority of the morning cleaning up the manual drafting lab.  The students and Anna left it a catastrophe.  Luckily, Pat put together the three new drafting tables.  Now all we need to do is cover them and install the parallel bars.  The computers still haven't gotten here yet.  Pat and I are upset because the supplier said that we'd have delivery on January 5.  HA!  Now the CAD Lab has 21 old computers and the middle of the room has 21 Viewsonic monitor boxes (the new monitors).  Not much else going on.  I'm going to type up some stuff for class tomorrow.

      Well, at about 4:30-4:45pm, the Mercury dealer called to say the Grand Marquis was ready.  Dad and I went to get it.  We won't be able to tell if it's really fixed until after we get another cold snap.  I really hope things are fixed for good.  Just finished dinner.  I made "Fake-aroni & Cheese Casserole."  I thought it was pretty good.  Granted, I would never mistake it for real macaroni & cheese, but it was a good replacement.  Mom got her bank statement, and she's still having problems with the Credit Union and the automatic payments for Dad's truck.  They're still taking it from their savings instead of their checking.  If it's not one thing, it's another.  Jeeze, the melodrama.  Tomorrow, I go back to work!  I'll be glad to get back into my routine.  Being off this long is for the birds!

      It's quite warm and breezy here in anticipation of the cold front that's supposed to roll through here tonight.  Bright and early this morning (7:30-8:00), Mom and Dad dropped the Mercury off at the dealer.  I hope they can fix the heater/ac today.  I hate the fact of getting a loaner if they don't finish today.  The waiting is the worse part.  It's 2:00 in the afternoon and we haven't heard anything.  Pat called me this morning.  It seems like I'll be teaching Anna's three curriculum day classes.  I'm supposed to teach two night classes, but I don't know if they'll let me teach both of them.  If they do, that'll put me over the limit for a full-time instructor, much less me being a part-timer.  We also talked about having Matteo be the Lab Assistant, if he wants.  Sad to say, but Matteo is the only second-year student I think would make a good assistant.

      After a 40-45 minute jog this morning (oddly-warm morning), I weighed-in.  I lost the 1.5 pounds that I gained last week.  I also stayed the same on bodyfat.  That makes 86.5 pounds lost.  Supposedly, the temperature is going to reach 77 today.  Mostly cloudy and warm, it's crazy!

      Last night, since I was bored and there was nothing worth watching on television, I took advantage of a special sneak preview of  Win A Date With Tad Hamilton .  It was very good.  Both Nathan Lane and Sean Hayes were great as Richard Levy and Richard Levy.  The main reason I went to the movie, however, was to see  Topher Grace .  He was even more attractive than his usual  That 70's Show  self!  I had a nice lunch date today.  Don't get too excited.  The lunch date was with three former students.  One of them, John, is moving to Raleigh to attend NCSU.  Wendy came with her new son, Steven.  He was a cutie-patutie with long eyelashes.  Lori was also there telling us how newlywed life is.  Wendy kept questioning Lori as to when she was going to get pregnant.  We had lunch at  Schlotzsky's Deli .  I had a small garden salad and a Diet Coke with lemon.  It was good to catch up.  After lunch, Dad and I had a nice 45 minute walk in the warm weather.  Today is sunny and in the low 70s.  It feels like April or May, not the beginning of January!

      Mom and I stayed up to watch Dick Clark on TV.  It was oh so exciting!  We both toasted in 2004 with a glass of wine ( Manischewitz , of course).  Then, we went to bed.  I sure can party down, huh?  Earlier, we all watched the DVD of  LXG:The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen .  It was really good.  The special effects were "top shelf" and the story was good enough to warrant a sequel.  There are 2 more DVDs that we rented with my Blockbuster gift card, but for the life of me I can't remember them.  Well, after putting all of my music in my new media towers, I had the notion to make a database using Microsoft Works.  I finished the inventory this morning.  I have  614  albums, cassette singles, cassettes, 45s, and CDs.  Now, if I'm crazy enough, I might just put them in alphabetical order!

      After about a 45 minute jog-walk, I can back from the wonderful outdoors and weighed-in.  I didn't lose or gain either weight or bodyfat.  For that, I am extremely thankful!  Keeping my fingers crossed, my monitor seems to be doing well.  I just changed my windows color scheme to be a little "lighter."  I hope that works.  Since the weather is so nice (highs in the mid to upper 60s - clear, sunny skies), I decided to try on an old pair of Gap khaki shorts (size 32).  Miracle of miracles, they fit!  I paired that with a yellow cotton pique polo.  Tonight is "Oscar night."  Mom and I never fail to watch them.  We usually watch every awards show.  Yes, we're award show junkies!

      Today was nice and quiet.  We did all of our routine Saturday stuff.  It was around 60 degrees and sunny.  After dinner, Dad and I went for a 50 minute walk.  When I came back from my walk, I noticed that my monitor was awfully dark.  I checked all the settings, and they seem normal.  I sure do hope that my monitor isn't going out.  That would just be the icing on the cake!  I'll keep you abreast of the situation.  Tomorrow is my weigh-in (cue scary organ music).  I hope everything goes well.  Since the weather was cold and rainy last week, I didn't get a chance to exercise as much as I'd like.

      Today is one of those cold, miserable days that just can't help from filling you with ennui or melancholia.  We haven't received any snow from this winter snow.  We're fortunate enough to just get rain, freezing rain, and sleet.  Tomorrow is the birthday of my department head, Pat.  After my night class last night, Mom and I went to Wally World to get four dozen mini-cupcakes and a birthday card.  He was genuinely surprised when both first- and second-year students and I sprang it on him.  Last night, I also picked up a box of the Slim-Fast low carb snack bars.  I got the cookies and cream flavor.  Despite their miniscule size, they are very delicious, and only 2 net carbs.  Just to give you some insight to my mood, I'm listening to the "Chill Out" station on LaunchCast radio.  It's a perfect accompaniment to my indifference.  Full of Morcheeba, Air, and Portishead.

      I was having a wonderful day today.  Work was going very well.  I got home and ran some errands with Mom.  When I got home from errands, the mail had been delivered.  Much to my dismay, the ER doctor's bill arrived from Akron, OH.  The bill was for $510.  With a crestfallen attitude, I wrote my check out.  I'll drop it by the post office on my way to work tomorrow morning.  I pray, to whomever will listen, that I am finished receiving bills from my "incident."  It almost makes me want to get married to a lesbian service member.  That way, I would get my ID card back and be able to go to the Naval Hospital.  I have a deep throbbing headache.  I'm not sure if it's from the bill or just from nature.  It's probably because I didn't jog this afternoon.  More than likely, I'll jog either right before or right after dinner.  Tomorrow, approximately 350 high school students will be visiting the college to visit three curricula of their choosing.  We had a good crowd last year and I hope this year's group is just as nice and orderly.  When I returned from night class last night, Mom informed me about President Bush and his constitutional amendment to limit marriage to "one man & one woman."  My thoughts:  I don't know why Bush is all "fired up" about protecting the institution of marriage from the "bad old gays & lesbians" like me.  With the divorce rate at over 50%, what's so special about gettin' hitched.  Hell, you can knock someone up without a marriage license.  If this amendment does get passed, not to fret.  Prohibition was an amendment too, and see how long that lasted!

      A friend of mine sent me a cool little java quiz to take.  It is based on the  Harvard Computer Society Dialect Survey .  It is located at:   urlLink Yankee or Dixie Quiz    I took it many times, and got two different answers.  I guess that relates back to me being a military brat of NY parents.  I scored just barely Dixie and somewhat Yankee.  I wish I could've taken the actual Harvard survey.  That would've been a "hoot."  You know, every time I think about Ralph Nader entering the 2004 Presidential Race, I want to spit!  It wasn't enough that he help nail the last nail into Gore's chances in 2000, but now he's going to get your (not mine) dunderheaded president re-elected.  My only solace in GW Bush getting re-elected is that it guarantees he'll be out of the political picture in 2008.  Work was very nice today.  I always enjoy my short days.  If only all of them were like today.  We also had very pleasant weather.  It was sunny and in the upper 60s.  This afternoon and evening, it started to cloud up.  The rain is supposed to begin tonight.  I just hope we don't get any "wintry mix."

      After a 40-minute jog, I weighed-in.  I lost 1.0 pounds, but gained 1% bodyfat.  That's okay in my book.  A good thing was that the one pound weight loss was without me taking my Hydroxycut.  I might or might not go back on it.  It's supposed to be nice today.  Temperatures in the upper 50s - low 60s, and mostly sunny skies.  I'll be glad once spring gets here.

      Today was very spring-like.  It was achingly sunny and quite warm (low 70s).  The only distraction was the wind.  After doing our routine Saturday shopping and such, I decided to take in a movie.  I went to see "50 First Dates" with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore.  I really, really liked it!  It was extremely funny, yet also sad at times.  Sean Austin was a welcomed surprise playing Drew's brother.  Who could've guessed that he was so buff and hunky?  Not much else going on.  I might even go see another movie tonight.  Lord knows there's nothing on television.

      Yesterday after afternoon, I received the first of many bills for my fainting incident.  The bill from Onslow Memorial Hospital was $1,431.25.  Today when I came I went and paid that bill.  While there, the "patient representative" told me that I will be receiving an ambulance bill and a bill from the "emergency physicians association."  When I got home, guess what was waiting for me?  An ambulance bill for $406.  I wrote out the check and told my parents that under NO circumstances can they call me an ambulance, ever!  Push come to shove, I'll freaking drive myself.  Work went well.  My morning class was working on their side elevations.  Our department was supposed to be visited by a group of High School Juniors today.  They were going to be the children of Hispanic Migrant Workers.  The Duke Endowment Fund was paying for them to explore their options other than becoming migrant workers.  The never stopped by.  Next Thursday, the college is holding a "career expo" for all the local High Schools.  Three different groups will be touring us for 30 minutes each.  Sounds like a blast!

      I'm sorry for neglecting my blogging duties.  I promise to do better.  Well, let me catch you up.  On Monday, I awoke to a light dusting of snow on the ground.  Luckily, I had work as usual.  A few of my students were under the misguided impression that we were having a 2-hour delay.  Afterwards, I came home and walked for almost an hour.  I didn't jog because it was bitterly cold.  Dad was off for Presidents' Day.    Tuesday, things were crazy because everyone was wondering if we were going to get more "wintry weather."  Thankfully, we didn't.  Dad came home from work before I went in because he was sick and not feeling well.  He has a head cold and an unproductive cough.  It was good to see a new episode of "Queer Eye For The Straight Guy" after my night class.  Today was another short day.  It wasn't as cold today (upper 40s).  It was also achingly sunny, but for that I was very glad.  This is one year that I happily wish for spring and summer.  We've been wetter and colder than normal.  This afternoon I went for a 35-40 minute jog.  The blustery winds were my only distraction.  I'm counting the days until I fly to Chicago.  I can't wait to see Debbie and the kids.  I just hope it's not too snowy and cold.  We're planning on being "Thelma & Louise" all week.  I'll also be lucky enough to be there during both big St. Patrick Day Parades.  The weekend before I go to Chicago, I'll be going to Asheville, NC on a school trip.  Every other year, Pat and I take the students up to see the Biltmore Estate.  It's an excellent example of American Castles.

      The weather has been steadily declining all day.  Mom and I just returned from shopping.  At Old Navy, I bought a pair of flat-front black khakis in size 32-30 for only $7.00.  They were slashing prices.  Mom bought Sarah a denim shortall and 6 pairs of socks.  Then, we went to Circuit City.  I bought 2 CDs.  I got  Five For Fighting - The Battle For Everything  and  Queer Eye For The Straight Guy Soundtrack .  Right now I'm listening to Five For Fighting.  It's very good.  If you enjoyed their last, then you'll like this one.

      I cannot believe that the weather people are predicting wintry mix for us tonight and tomorrow morning.  I just can't win!  After reading the paper this morning, I went for a 35-40 minute jog.  It was cold, gray, and drizzly.  When I got home I weighed-in.  I didn't lose or gain any weight, but I did lose 2% bodyfat.  That makes 93.0 pounds and 27% bodyfat lost.  Woo Hoo!  My new BP med is making me more like Mom.  My hands and feet are usually cold now.  I'm just thankful that my nose isn't also cold.  LOL  I'm contemplating going to the movies or maybe Circuit City.  Hell, I might even go to Books-A-Million.  Watch out, I'm crazy!

      It was cold (mid-40's) and rainy all day today.  Mom and I went to the commissary, then all three of us went to Sam's Club.  In addition to all the usuals, we bought "Lost In Translation."  It was very good, albeit a tad sad.   I napped this afternoon since there wasn't anything else to do.  Right now, I'm watching SpongeBob SquarePants on Nick.

      I was a very good instructor today.  I brought in Valentine cookies for the first- and second-year students.  Needless to say, all 72 were eaten within an hour.  It makes me happy to bring goodies to the class.  After class, I had office hours.  During that time, I was playing around with the new version of Architectural Desktop.  Once I got home, Mom and I went to our respective banks to take care of our NC tax refunds.  Mom and Dad's and my state refund came in the mail yesterday.  Now I'm waiting for my federal refund.  Woo Hoo - I love a windfall!  Not much else going on.  Mom and I just returned from the mall.  We were in JC Penny, getting three short outfits for my niece, Sarah.  She's such a tall skinny minnie.  Speaking of the impending Valentine's Day, I really feel left out.  I never get anything, or get the chance to give someone something nice.  Little by little, however, I'm accepting the fact that I'll always be single.  As long as I have the love of my family, it doesn't seem so bleak.  That's not to say that if someone like Tom Welling or Travis Fimmel came knocking on my door, I'd turn them away!  I might be lonely, but I'm sure as hell not stupid!  My head is slowly getting better.  My scab is still jagged and raised, but it doesn't itch anymore.  The back of my head isn't very tender.  I can lay my head back on pillows and recliners without wincing.  It's a good thing my head is SO hard!

      In another hint that things are returning to normal, I went jogging this afternoon.  I jogged to 35 minutes.  It felt good to be back to exercising.  It makes me feel like less of a slacker.  Work went well.  Mom's appointment at the Naval Hospital went well.  Nothing much else going on.

      Well, I now have a little less metal on my body!  My doctor's appointment went well.  Dr. Eldin took out my staples and wrote me a scrip for Toprol-XL.  He said he'll see me when I reach my goal weight.  He again told me to watch out for dizzy spells, "Passing out and falling could lead to fatal injuries."  I dropped my scrip off at Eckerds.  I'll probably pick it up after dinner.  I might also stop by the new coffee place.  It's open now and looks like it has some good atmosphere.

      After Dad and I went for a 50 minute walk this morning, I weighed-in.  I was kinda apprehensive about this week's weigh-in.  Shockingly, I lost 3 pounds and 3% bodyfat.  That makes 93 pounds lost.  Yippee!!  Mom, Dad, and I went to the new Home Depot.  It was nice, but their appliance selection left a little to be desired.  I just hope that it doesn't become all cluttered like the one in Wilmington.

      Today was sunny and mild.  The wind seems to be dying down as well.  I just came back from the movies.  I went to see "Big Fish."  It was very good.  Mom and I went to the commissary this morning.  I'm still trying to get used to the news beta blocker.  Nothing bad, just makes me feel like I'm taking cold medicine.  Dad and I went for a 50 minute walk around lunchtime.  In the sun, our jackets were too much, but in the windy shade, we were glad to be wearing them.  Since I'm waiting for dinner (strip steak on the grill), I thought I'd blog.  I hope everything is good tomorrow when I weigh-in.

      Well, I'm back from my short day at work.  I can tell that the Toprol-XL is working.  Besides my BP being lower, I'm feeling somewhat lethargic.  It's not too bad, I have to admit!  Surprisingly, my head doesn't hurt that much.  I haven't had to take any of the Tylenol-3 w/codeine.  I usually just take 2 regular tylenol before bed.  The bad thing is that I try not to roll over in bed, so I end up getting a cramp in my right hip (from laying on my right side all night).

      After great care, I managed to shampoo my hair without hurting my 5 head staples.  I was also amazed that I didn't roll over in my sleep.  After a good breakfast and only my vitamin, I went to work.  My day was very uneventful.  Of course, everyone asked after me.  I hate all the fuss.  Mom and Dad gave me a Thank You card to give to everyone at work.  They were so thankful for their quick action.  At 2:00pm I went to Dr. Eldin for my appointment.  Since I didn't take any meds this morning, my BP was 150/90.  My pulse was also very fast.  He decided to change my meds to TOPROL-XL 50mg a day.  He gave me 21 sample pills.  I'm to take one a day and record my BP and pulse between now and my follow-up appointment on Monday afternoon at 2:30.  That's also when they'll take out the 5 staples.  He said he'd look at my BP/pulse record and write a prescription for the TOPROL-XL.  At the doctor's office, it said that I was 2.5 pounds heavier than my Sunday weigh-in.  I imagine that is from the 3-4 bags of IV they pumped into me yesterday at the ER.  I know Mom and Dad feel better now that Dr. Eldin has me on a new track.  I feel better too.  I hope that all this is behind me now.

      To my great horror, I fainted in class this morning.  I was walking around class, helping students, when I felt all hot, sweaty, and lightheaded.  I turned to tell the class that I wasn't feeling good, then the next I knew, I was laying on the floor.  I passed out and cracked the back of my head open on the edge of one of the drafting tables.  The students called 911 and then alerted security.  Everyone came to my aid, and I felt the complete fool.  The paramedics came and took me to Onslow Memorial Hospital.  My secretary, Donna, called my Mom.  Mom called Dad, and they met me at the ambulance.  I got to the ER and was checked in.  I was diagnosed with "Dehydration/Vagal/Hypotensive Syncope with Left Occipital Laceration."  Evidently, me restarting my lisinopril and my maxide caused my bp to drop as well as extreme dehydration.  I was monitored and had about 8-9 leads stuck to my torso.  I also had an IV and about 3-4 bags of IV solution to rehydrate me.  There is a 3" vertical gash (not deep) on the back left side of my head.  They had to close it with 5 staples!  The needle to numb my head was the worst!  I checked into the ER at 10:58am and was discharged at 1:07pm.  I am so thankful to the students in my second-year class.  Matteo (I think called 911) and Paul used his "hoodie" on my head wound.  Even as they were taking me away by ambulance, I told Donna to try and get someone to cover my afternoon class.  She told me that was the last thing I should worry about.  But, it wasn't.  After returning home, I called work and talked to both Donna and Pat.  Jenice (a graduate) covered my afternoon class.  They notified Continuing Education, and Steve (their director) cancelled tonight's night class.  I told everyone that I'll be back to class tomorrow.  I still have an appointment with my regular doctor tomorrow at 2pm.  They were notified about my ER visit.  I have to bring them copies of everything from the ER.  I'll be glad once this is all over.  What makes this all even worse is that today is my parents 42nd Anniversary.  I felt like such a boob!  I'm just SO grateful that I didn't wet or mess myself when I passed out.

      Well, I woke up this morning and felt "odd."  I took my blood pressure and was not surprised to see it and my pulse quite high.  I went about my business and went to work.  Today was a short day, and I came home at noon.  I took my bp and pulse again, and found it still high.  I called my old doctor and made an appointment for Wednesday afternoon at 2.  I also took my old lisinopril and maxide (I had kept about a week's worth saved).  As of 2:45pm, my bp has gone down, but my pulse is still kinda high and it feels kinda "fluttery" every once in a while.  When the mailman came I was happy to see my ticketless travel itinerary from Southwest Airlines.  Now I'm all set for my trip to Chicago in March.

      After much trepidation, I weighed-in this morning without jogging first.  I lost 0.5 pounds, but gained 3% bodyfat.  That makes 90 pounds lost.  I'll take that gladly!  I had a hard time getting to sleep last night.  I was awake until after 2am.  I kept listening to the heater click on and off.  As the minutes dragged on, my mind was screaming that I needed to get to sleep.  For the past day or two, my TMJ has been acting up on the left side of my jaw.  Well, if it keeps up for too long, that'll help my diet (ha ha ha)!  Since today was the start of my Gold Card Week at GNC, Mom and I went so I could pick up some things.  I got a canister of Atkins bake mix and my CardioFlow.  Oh, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Sam's had the new flavors of Fruit2O.  I picked up a case to try out.

      If you recall, I got my haircut on Monday.  Well, it's short enough for me to comb forward in a "Caesar" style that is popular with the "hip kids" who shop at AE and A&F.  When I went into work on Tuesday and today, quite a few students said that they liked my new 'do and they thought it made me look younger.  I took that as a compliment even though in the back of my head I was thinking,  "What, was I looking 'old' before?"   Oh, I heard through the grapevine that there were four applications for the full-time job (me and three others).  I couldn't get any more information from my "source."  They did say that they'd keep me in the loop.  Our divisional meeting went well.  It was a lunch meeting, so we had salad and Chik-Fil-A.  Of course, I had salad with ranch dressing and the chicken from the chicken sandwich cut up on the salad.  It was quite delightful.  In a little bit, I'm going to jog on the treadmill.  I didn't get a chance to when I came home from work because I had stuff to do.  I also had to make our low-carb "meatza."

      HoHum!  I feel good, but unmotivated.  I just finished having dinner.  I made low-carb "Joe" (sausage, green beans, eggs, and cheese casserole).  After work, Mom and I got haircuts.  It was my treat.  I got mine cut kinda short because I wanted a change.  Then we came home and I went for a 40 minute jog.  After that, I did some exercises (push-ups, crunches, etc).  Mom made her "crack tea" today with Splenda instead of regular sugar.  It is plenty sweet enough, but Mom always puts SO much lemon in.  It's more like lemonade with a tad bit of tea!  The local weatherman is saying that we're supposed to get down to 43 degrees tonight.  Brrrr!  Luckily, we're supposed to rebound tomorrow and get up to the low 60s.  Tomorrow is my Advisory Committee Meeting.  Basically, every department is supposed to have an annual meeting with the people out in the "working world", in our field, to let them know what has been accomplished over the past year and what we plan to do in the next 12 months.  We usually have lackluster attendance and it only lasts about an hour.  I just hope it doesn't take too much out of my lunch/office hours.

      Well, after a 40 minute walk on the treadmill last night, and a 45 minute jog this morning, I weighed-in.  I was disappointed to see that I had gained 3.0 pounds.  Luckily, I stayed the same on my bodyfat.  That leads me to believe that I might've gained muscle.  We all went to Sam's to get our weekly essentials.  Then we just vegetated for the rest of the afternoon.  I even took a nap for about an hour.  Mom and I went to Michael's and Target.  I ended up buying 2 bags of jelly beans since I know Mom and Dad like them.  We just finished dinner.  It was a beef roast in a "brown-n-bag" along with red potatoes.  We also had mixed veggies and brown gravy.  Nothing too fancy.

      Mom and I went to the commissary this morning, like we do every Saturday.  Well, coming off base, we were stopped at the light at Tarawa Terrace I housing.  Then, I feel someone bump into us!  I pulled right into the Blockbuster parking lot.  An old guy driving a Ford Crown Victoria also pulls in.  I get out to see if anything was wrong to my car.  All there was were the two indentations from the screws holding in his front license plate.  The old guy gets out of his car with a portable oxygen tank!  We took his name, address, and phone number.  I was SO furious I could've strangled him with the oxygen line!  Anyway, we go home and Dad decides just to get some touch up paint.  Mom calls the geezer to let him know that we were just going to touch up the paint.  The old guy said he would send us a $10 check.  Poor Mom, evidently, the guy is also almost stone deaf and couldn't hear our name and address very well!  I'm tellin' ya, nobody should have a license except for ME!  After that debacle, Mom and Dad took the Mercury down to Sears because the rear driver tire has been slowly losing air since before I went to Chicago.  We were thinking that it was one of the new tires from Sears.  It was one of the two original tires that was plugged prior.  So, they just went ahead and replaced that tire.  Now I only have one original tire left.  Not much else is going on.  We just finished having dinner.  We had hot dogs, bratwurst, chili, sauerkraut, cheese sauce, and oven fries.  Of course, I had all but the fries (boo, hiss).  Later on, I'll probably walk on the treadmill.  You know, the treadmill makes me feel like a giant-sized hamster!  Kinda like my life is an endless monotony.

      It must be the warm weather, or it might be that I'm in a "manic" phase, but this morning I stopped by Dunkin Donuts and bought two dozen donuts for the students.  Needless to say, they scarfed them up like they'd never eaten before.  The weather today was very lovely.  It was sunny and in the upper 70s.  After work, Mom and I ran some errands.  Then, we came home and I took a nap.  I felt very guilty napping in the afternoon.  It was such a luxury!  Not much else going on.  I might go to the movies tonight or tomorrow.  I want to see both Ladykillers and Jersey Girl.  Oh, celebrity gossip alert!  I just heard that Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz are officially split up.  My sugar-daddy is now free to sweep me off my feet!

      Today is a beautiful spring day.  It's sunny and in the mid 60s.  I just finished a 45 minute jog around the neighborhood.  You know, I'm beginning to like jogging more and more, but I don't like it when my nipples get rubbed raw.  Yes, I know, what an unpleasant thing to talk about.  Hell, I might have to start wearing those little round band-aids.  Nothing's worse than bleeding on your shirt!  Work was good today.  Pat returned from his convalescence.  His ortho doctor told him that he actually broke (not fractured) his collar bone.  The doc said Pat broke it in "the best place possible."  Call me insane, but I don't think there's ANY good place for a break.  Everything should heal nicely.  I still think Pat's just lolly-gagging to avoid wearing a tie!  Right now, in the background, I have Fuse on the television.  Sometimes I feel SO out of touch with today's popular music.  At least Fuse still plays music videos, unlike MTV or VH1.  I haven't heard anything "through the grapevine" about the job opening.  It's probably still too early.  Maybe Donna, our secretary, will keep me posted.  I'm hoping that I'm the only one to apply for the position.  LOL - like that kind of good fortune falls in my lap!  I haven't heard anything from Key Risk, the company handling my workmen's comp. claim.  If I get any money to cover my doctor bills, I'll be extremely happy.  Who knows, with that money I might buy something frivolous like an mp3 jukebox (20-40GB) or maybe even a laptop.

      I really didn't want to get out of bed this morning.  It was cold and sunny, and I longed to stay under my covers.  I did, however, manage to make myself presentable.  I even wore my new Dr. Martens.  When I got to work, I saw that Pat, my Department Head, had a weird contraption around his shoulders.  It was like a backpack, but without the pack.  Two arm straps were just around his shoulders.  He was also holding one arm up to his sternum (like it was in a sling).  He told us that he had fractured his collarbone.  Evidently, this past weekend, Pat had gone to Georgia for a bicycle race.  About 200 meters before the finish line, the guy on the bike in front of Pat caused a crash.  Pat swerved to miss it, but managed to clip the guy's rear tire, and flipped over and landed on his shoulder.  Pat came to work this morning because we have a policy that states we cannot extend a holiday.  Kinda silly, huh?  Pat left work at noon.  I substituted for his afternoon class.  It was just two hours of "babysitting" the second-year class.  He'll also be out tomorrow.  Since I also have classes tomorrow, he asked a graduate to sub for his morning class.  After my morning class, I hand delivered my application to the Personnel Department.  I felt SO much better once I dropped it off.  I was dying to ask how many other applications were submitted, but they wouldn't tell me if I did.  So hopefully, the fourth time will be the charm!  I think I'll walk on the treadmill at 7pm tonight.  Since I had to sub, I didn't get the opportunity to walk or jog.  You know, I'm seriously thinking about applying for ABC's Extreme Makeover.  I want to have all of my extra skin removed.  I also want liposuction and maybe a neck lift.  I don't want anything done to my face.  Hell, I might also apply for Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.

      Well, it's Sunday afternoon, and I had a great vacation in Chicago.  I'm glad to be back home, though.  Last night, we got home about 6:30.  Mom and Dad were SO glad to have me back.  I have to admit that it's great to be back.  I unpacked and relaxed.  I woke up after almost 11 hours of sleep.  I slept the sleep of the dead!  I read the newspaper and then I went on a 40 minute jog.  After a week of no "regimented" exercise, I was worried that I had gained some weight.  I weighed-in and was amazed to see that I lost 4.0 pounds and 1% bodyfat.  That makes 99.0 pounds and 28% bodyfat lost.  I guess me cooking for Debbie and her family was good for my diet.  Mom and I went to the PX.  While there, I got a pair of Dr. Martens Gibson Shoe in brown.  Not much else going on.  I'm going to go work on dinner.

      I can hardly believe that I tomorrow I'll get to be reunited (and it feels SO good) with my wacky sister!  We turn into two clucking hens when we're together.  Work went by in the blink of an eye.  I brought cookies in for both first- and second-year students.  They were gone in no time.  One of the students made and brought in Tollhouse chocolate chip cookies.  Everyone thought they were good, but just too crumbly.  So, I'm still winner and champion of cookies at work!  Since I'll be on vacation when I normally weigh-in, I decided to weigh in this afternoon.  I was very happy to see that I lost 2.0 pounds and 1% bodyfat.  That makes 95.0 pounds and 27% bodyfat lost.  WOO HOO!!  Now, if only my stuffy/runny head would just go away.  This change of weather is the only thing I hate about the onset of Spring.  I can guarantee that we'll get to RDU Airport in PLENTY of time for my flight.  Good thing I'm bringing a book to read while I wait for my flight.

      It's hard to believe that it's already Thursday!  Where did the week go?  I can't wait until Saturday!!  I'll get to see my sister in Chicago.  Last night, I walked on the treadmill my other sister gave me.  I walked for 3 miles.  I walked at a pace of about 3.6-3.7 miles per hour.  I was quite sweaty afterwards.  It felt good.  I have a sinus thing going on.  I'm pretty sure it's because the pollen is beginning to fall.  All of the flowering pear trees are bursting with white flowers.  Western Boulevard looks absolutely angelic.  Unfortunately, the blooms are short lived.  Today was my Marianne's birthday.  She's the Divisional Chair, my boss' boss.  I bought her two pillar candles from Target.  One was a blackberry candle in a glass apothecary jar, and the other was a rose candle with flowers embedded in it.  Marianne said she loved them and thought she'd keep them in her office.  Tomorrow, since it's the last school day before Spring Break, I'm wearing a yellow shirt and a VERY green tie.  I'm also bringing Shamrock sugar cookies to the students.  I hope they like them.  One or two students have suggested I bring chocolate chip cookies instead.  Can you believe the nerve.  Nothing like looking a gift horse in the mouth!

      Back to the daily grind today.  Work went well and I always love my short days.  This week is kinda odd.  We're just back from Asheville, and this weekend is the start of our "Spring Break."  I get the feeling that not much will get done this week.  Well, yesterday's newspaper had the job listing posted in the classified section.  The closing date is March 23.  Because of that, I went over to the registrar's office to get an updated official transcript.  I already have my cover letter and resume updated.  Now I need to fill out another application.  Donna, our secretary, agreed to write me a letter of recommendation.  Two graduates have also agreed.  I only plan on reusing my "professional statement."  It was what I was most proud of last time.  I went on a nice 38 minute jog this afternoon.  It was sunny, breezy, and in the upper 50s.  Even though I have a new treadmill, courtesy of my sister Donna, I still plan on jogging as much outside as possible.  I'll mainly use the treadmill of my long work days and rainy days.

      Well, it's a beautiful Sunday afternoon and I just returned from my weekend trip to Asheville with the department to visit Biltmore Estate.  Since Sundays are also my weigh-in days, I just weighed in.  I gained 1.0 pound of weight but didn't lose or gain bodyfat.  I'm not too surprised, but also not too happy.  The trip up to Asheville went well.  Eddie, Eugene, and I rode in Pat's Jimmy.  We stayed at a Quality Inn & Suites.  It was a very nice hotel.  Friday night, we all met up for dinner at Applebee's.  I had the blackened chicken salad.  It was windy and rainy Friday night, and the outlook was grim for Saturday's trip to Biltmore.  Saturday morning, the rain moved off to the east and the sun came out in full force.  It was also about 62 degrees.  We toured the house, greenhouse, gardens (not in bloom), and took the "behind-the-scenes" tour.  Then it was off to the winery.  We all did some tasting, then I went to the gift shop.  I bought a bottle of Chenin Blanc for myself, and a hat pin for Dad, and a 3D magnet of the house for Mom.  Saturday night, a group of us went to eat at a great German-Italian restaurant called "Black Forest Restaurant."  I had the saurbraten.  It was SO good!  This morning, we left the hotel about 8:30am.  Pat made good time, and we got back home at 2:30.  I'm glad we only make that trip every other year.  I always learn something new, but the trips to the estate can get monotonous if you're not careful.  This weekend, Mom and Dad went up to visit with my sister Donna and her family.  Of course they got home before me.  They also brought back with them a treadmill that my sister had bought for my two nieces.  I am so thankful to Donna.  I'll get much use out of it.  I also hope Mom can get a little use out of it.

      Boy, today is  SO  beautiful!  It is partly cloudy and in the upper 70s.  There's a gentle breeze and the humidity isn't too high.  Days like today make me itch for Spring and Summer.  Work was good.  I don't understand it, but here lately, I've been filling out quite a few warning and drop notices.  Students are starting to get "spring fever" even before Spring.  In preparation of my trip to Asheville this weekend, I went to the store to pick up some snakes for the 5-6 hour drive.  I picked up both low-carb and regular snacks.  I got two different kinds of string cheese, two flavors of sliced pepperoni, two cans of mixed nuts, gum, Altoids, pretzels, vanilla & chocolate cookies, Cheese-its, and flavored water.  That should be enough for me, Pat, Eddie, and Eugene.  If not, well then, too bad!  I just got out of the shower after a very sweaty jog.  I jogged for a little over 30 minutes, but was soaked through my hoodie!  Talk about a sweaty Betty!  Tonight is the premiere of  Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital .  I can't wait to see it.  I don't know if I should tape that or The West Wing.  I'm so conflicted!

      Today was in the low 70s and partly cloudy.  A very pleasant spring-like day.  I love days like this!  I stayed up last night and watched the 76th Annual Oscar Awards.  Billy Crystal did an excellent job as host, and managed to get in a jab at both the Governator and GW Bush.  I really want to see Cold Mountain and LOTR:ROTK.  Work today went smooth as silk.  Maybe that's because all of the students are glad this is a short week.  Hell, I'm glad we're going to Asheville on Friday.  Supposedly, we're in store for nice weather this weekend.  This afternoon, out of the blue, I got a call from the "front office" at work.  They were questioning me about my "incident."  They needed as much information as possible for the incident report.  They even requested I bring in copies of all of my bills.  I copied them and brought them all 4 bills.  I should get one more phone call, but then, who knows.  I might even get partially reimbursed.  After that, I decided to go for a jog in this great weather.  I did about 40 minutes and was soaked!  It felt good though, especially in the shower, working out the soreness.

      I just finished working on my Powerpoint presentation for my interview.  All I have to do now is make some handouts for the kids and burn the presentation to a CD.  I'm in the den with Mom.  She's watching Jerry Springer.  I can't believe that she watches him and all of the "judge shows".  Mom is also doing her plastic canvas crafts.

      Nothing is going on with me.  I'm sitting here in the den, watching the local evening news.  Last night, I walked on the treadmill for 2 miles.  It only took me 30 minutes.  I didn't walk for too long because I wanted to watch ER without any distractions.  So, I walked during Will & Grace.

      It's really phenomenal, I'm sitting here in a recliner in the den blogging on my new laptop.  I love it!  Earlier this evening, I walked on the treadmill for three miles.  It took me about 43-44 minutes.  I'm getting better and better.  I hope to be back to jogging at full force soon.  Although, walking instead of jogging is better for me (or so I hear and read).  I talked to my sister, Debbie, this evening.  She's got an appointment to see about getting WLS (weight loss surgery).  I worry about her.  I know she'd do well, but I keep hearing about the high mortality rate.  I couldn't bear to have anything happen to her.  Fat or skinny, I love her unconditionally!  I know she feels like a failure because I'm losing weight with low-carb, but she shouldn't.  I don't have three kids to cook and deal with.  I just have two parents who are more than flexible when it comes to me cooking and eating low-carb.

      Today was the 50th birthday of our Divisional Secretary, Donna.  Yesterday afternoon, I helped our Divisional Chair, Marianne, decorate the office once Donna had left for the day.  This morning I brought in a card and a "Joe To Go" coffee card.  I wanted to get her a gift card to Dunkin Donuts since she gets coffee there almost every morning, but when I stopped in they said they didn't do gift certificates or gift cards!  How insane is that?  Disgruntled, but not deterred, I went to Books-A-Million and got a gift card from their Joe Muggs coffee shop.  She really loved it.  She told me that since Joe Muggs doesn't open early, she'd have to send one of our students to pick up her coffee.  I said, "Sure, no problem."  That's one of the perks of having students.  I didn't get a chance to stay for Donna's actual birthday celebration since I had to be home waiting for the RoadRunner people to come hook up the wireless internet.  Two different guys came.  The first guy swapped out the modems, and the second guy came and configured everything.  Now I'm all wireless internet.  The thing that kinda sucks, however, is that even though I have two computers hooked up to the internet (one wired, one wireless), they aren't networked together.  Oh well, at least I can surf the internet all though the house and yard.

      I love technology!  I took my new laptop to work with me this morning.  I hooked it to our internet and was up and running in no time.  I registered stuff and authorized software left and right.  The students were thoroughly impressed!  After work, I came home and cleaned up my bedroom.  I had a whole nightstand's worth of papers and magazines to sift through.  I had a very heavy lawn bag when I was done.  In the process, I found some stuff I was looking for.  Afterwards, Dad called and said that our answering machine wasn't picking up.  I tinkered and fiddled with it before coming to the conclusion that it had, indeed, died.  Mom and I went to Circuit City where I bought a new AT&T phone/answering machine.  Now we're set.  This morning, Mom drove me to work and picked me up because she had to drop by the Naval Hospital to have blood drawn prior to her Friday appointment.  After getting the new phone set up, the hospital called to tell Mom to come back in so they could draw more blood.  The initial tests showed Mom had elevated potassium levels.  So, we returned and Mom was sucked dry.  This time, the results were normal.  Sometimes, I don't think the Naval Hospital knows what it is doing.

      On Friday night I walked 3 miles, on Saturday night I walked 3 miles, and this morning I walked 3 miles on my treadmill.  That helped me lose 0.5 pounds and 1% bodyfat.  That makes 98.0 pounds and 27% bodyfat lost.  Not much else is going on.  I might go to the movies today.  I want to see "Ella Enchanted".  Mom wants to go to Belk at 1pm.  I also need to get a bag and mouse for my laptop.

      Today was a good day.  After work, Mom and I went to the commissary and the package store.  I played with my laptop for a while.  I'm trying to get the swing of the touchpad.  I might just get an optical USB mouse.  We had meatza tonight.  It is always SO good.  It feels like I'm cheating on my low-carb lifestyle, even though I'm not.  I made one that was half pepperoni and half mushroom.  I had to pick up my blood pressure script this evening.  Afterwards, Mom and I stopped by Belk's.  She was searching for a new pair of sandals to replace a multi-colored pair with numerous straps.  Trust me on this, her old ones are NOT a pretty sight!  I think she should get either some Birkenstocks or some Rainbows.  Then she'll be the "hip" Mom/Gramma.  I walked on the treadmill tonight for the first time since I fell jogging (Sunday).  I walked 3.0 miles at a pace of 4 MPH.  Tomorrow and Sunday will be more of the same.  I need to do a week's worth of missed exercise before I weigh in on Sunday.

      Well, I feel so naughty.  Yesterday, Mom and I went to the PX so I could pay on the exchange credit card.  I was dumbfounded to find out the limit was raised.  I was looking at the laptops.  They had Sony Vaio's on sale.  I didn't get one yesterday, but this afternoon, Mom and I went back and I bought a Sony Vaio PCG-K15 laptop.  I brought it home and noticed that it was already opened.  I plugged it in and saw that it had been previously purchased.  Well, I wrapped it back up and Mom and I returned it (post haste).  They were shocked to hear it was "used."  I exchanged it for an "unused" one.  Now I'm good to go.  Next Wednesday, the RoadRunner guy is coming to hook up my wireless internet.  WOO HOO!  Welcome to the 21st century!

      Today is a beautiful summer day.  It's a cloudless blue sky with abundant sun and temps in the low 80s.  I love days like today, especially on my short days.  This morning during my shower, I had to rip off the bandages and band-aids.  Unfortunately, the scabs stuck to them.  After the shower, I sprayed them with the no stick, no sting spray and put new band-aids on them.  While at work, I got a call from VP Lewis about the interviews.  Evidently, I was his first call.  I had my pick of the 4 times and days.  I chose Tuesday, June 4 at 3:45pm.  It is the first appointment, but I want to get it over with as soon as possible!  The topic for the teaching demo is, "Lettering Techniques Used In Manual Drafting".  I'll probably do a PowerPoint Presentation along with my "hands-on" part of the lesson.  I also want to have a color "handy handout" with a 6 point lesson plan.  When I got home from work, I was surprised to see that Dad had taken the afternoon off.  He was planting Mom's new hibiscus tree next to the garage.  Dad said he was also taking tomorrow off.  They went to Lowe's and got all of Dad's animal food.  He really spoils the birds and squirrels!  They eat better than some of the neighbors.  While they were gone, I changed into shorts, took off all of my band-aids (to aid in scab formation), and sat in the sun reading my new issue of The Advocate.  When they returned from the store, I went online to www.Southwest.com and booked our flight to Chicago during my summer break from the college.  Mom had asked me if we were going to visit Debbie even if I didn't get the job.  I said, "Hell yeah!"  No job is worth jeopardizing my sanity!  So, Mom and I fly to Chicago on Saturday, June 26 and return Sunday, July 4.  Debbie should get a copy of the email itinerary when she checks her mail tonight.  Not much else going on.  I need to go make a salad for dinner.

      All three of us are back from Virginia.  Dad and I went up to Donna's house to pick Mom up from her "vacation".  We left up there at about 2:30am and got home at about 8:15.  Since today was a "weigh-in" day, I decided to change and go jogging.  The jog began like any other.  The weather was warm and the azaleas were in full, fragrant bloom.  I got near the Post Office, and tripped on some uneven sidewalk.  Well, I went down like a sack of anvils.  Luckily, I didn't break anything except my pride.  I felt like an utter fool!  My walkman came out of the pocket on my hoodie, and I landed on my left knee and hand.  I scraped the skin off the left knee.  I also scraped the skin off two knuckles (middle & ring) on the back of my left hand as well as a patch of skin off the fat pad next to the thumb on the inside of that hand.  I'm all bandaged up now, but until I walked (not jogged) home, I was a bloody mess.  I dressed my wounds, took to arthritis Tylenol and am trying to ignore my sore knee.  I know nothing is seriously wrong because I can bend and walk on it.  It's just REALLY sore and tender.  I'm so glad it didn't swell up.  After that, I did weigh-in.  I was pleased to see that I lost 3.5 of the 4 pounds I gained last week.  Unfortunately, the scale said I gained 2% bodyfat.  I just can't win, can I?  Oh well, at least I lost weight.  Mom and I went to the commissary when it opened at 11.  Since we hadn't gone in the two weeks Mom was away, our bill came to 180 dollars.  Then, all three of us went to Sam's Club.  Now I think I might go lay down.  I'm so tired from leaving Donna's at 2:30.

      It's really odd!  It's after 6:00pm and I'm not in class teaching.  I'm home, enjoying my break from night classes.  My next night class begins May 18.  Work went well today.  I heard through the grapevine that the topic for my teaching demonstration will be hand lettering techniques.  I still haven't heard about scheduling my interview.  I hope they don't try to call tomorrow afternoon.  When I get off from work, Dad and I are driving up to my sister's house in Alexandria, Virginia.  We're going up there to pick up Mom.  She's been up there for two weeks.  Last night I jogged on the treadmill for little over three miles.  Tonight I might jog another three miles.  I need to jog since I won't be able to this weekend.

      Today is one of those grey, chilly days.  It's currently 3:00pm and it's only 52 degrees.  I can smell that our next door neighbor has a fire going.  I love that chimney smell.  It always reminds me of autumn.  Work went well today.  I heard that the interviews are supposed to be May 4-6.  I hope to hear something soon.  Evidently, one of the applicants is a woman from Indiana who is relocating to Wilmington.  Another is a former student who works for a local builder.  I'm the third one, but I haven't heard anything about the fourth one.  Not much else is going on.  My allergies are acting up despite the fact that I'm taking Claritin.  I'll be glad when the pollen is all gone.

      After a 40-minute jog on the treadmill, I weighed-in.    The results mirrored the grey, dreary weather.  I gained 4.0 pounds, but lost 1% bodyfat.  In my mind, I'm hoping that I gained muscle and lost fat.  Irregardless, I'll be going on the "tic-tac diet" for the next week.  Not a damn thing going on.  We called Mom to wish her a happy Easter.  The girls were sleeping and Mom wasn't sure when Donna & Dennis were returning.  Dad and I decided to have Tyson roasted chicken tonight for dinner.

      I didn't think my weekend could get much more quiet, but boy was I wrong.  It's 5:00 pm and I haven't left the house.  I almost feel like a "shut-in".  The weather is very nice.  It was in the low 70s and sunny.  Mom called this morning after Donna & Dennis left for their weekend alone.  She was planning on taking the kids to see "Hellboy".  That was mainly to appease Jonathan.  I'm sure Donna and Krystie could care less about that movie.  I might go to the movies tonight.  Sad thing is, I really have no urge to go out.

      Ah, to be off from work!  This truly is a "Good Friday".  I woke up at 7:45 feeling like I'd slept the day away.  Right away, I trimmed, pounded, and marinated the steaks Dad and I are having for dinner.  Then I started the laundry.  I thought I'd get started on the wash so it wouldn't "accidentally" get ruined.  I've already received phone calls from Dad at work, and Mom up in Virginia.  Mom said that Donna & Dennis just left for their "Harley Weekend".  After the laundry is done, I plan on jogging, showering, and maybe going shopping.  Woo Hoo, what an exciting day!

      Ah, a warm Wednesday!  Great weather like today was even sweeter since it was my short day.  After work, I went to the store to pick up some cookies to bake for my first- and second-year students.  I'm baking them right now to take in tomorrow, since the college is closed for "Good Friday".  I'm making white chocolate/Macadamia nut and chocolate chip with pastel M&Ms.  After a lovely dinner of ham steaks and cheesy broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots, I jogged three miles on the treadmill.  Ah yes, what a busy life I lead.

      It's Monday, and I had a short day at work.  This morning was kinda weird since I didn't have to be quiet while I got ready for work.  I still miss Mom, though.  After work, I went to Wal-Mart and Sam's.  I had to pick up some stuff that they didn't have at the commissary.  I jogged on the treadmill for 3 miles before dinner.  Dad came in and scared me.  For dinner I made a big chef's salad.  Dad also had a sandwich.  I just had the sandwich meat.  Tonight will be a quiet one.  Dad and I had to click on the heat in case it gets cold in the house.  We're supposed to get down to 32 degrees.

      For lack of anything else to do, Dad and I went to see "Home On The Range."  It was a very good cartoon.  The music was great, but I wish the movie wasn't as short as it was.  Surprisingly, Dad also enjoyed the movie despite all of the kids.  Dad didn't even complain about the loudness.  After the movie, Fred & Mary came down and visited with us for about an hour or so.  Mary is SO funny.  We were discussing her kitchen remodel.  We both were talking about the things we liked and disliked in new kitchens.  She has expensive taste as do I.  We finished dinner a while ago.  Dad and I had the boneless pork rib "mystery meat" with green beans and broccoli.  It was good and easy.

      Well, we survived Daylight Savings.  I am on time.  This morning, after a 40 minute jog around the neighborhood, I weighed-in.  I lost 2.0 pounds, but gained 1% bodyfat.  That 's two pounds lost from the three pounds gain from the previous week.  Mom called a little bit ago.  She said she was having a good time and that they'd be in and out all day.  I told her that Dad and I would probably go see "Home On The Range."

      Mom left with Donna and Krystie this morning at about 4:45.  Mom called at about 10:45 from Donna's house to say they got there safely.  I hope Mom has a safe and happy time up there.  Dad and I cut the grass this morning.  It was quite breezy and unseasonably cool.  This afternoon, Dad and I went for a walk that lasted one hour.  It was very nice.  After that, we went to Logan's Roadhouse for dinner.  My cousin Jo gave us a gift certificate for Christmas and we redeemed it tonight.  I had the chopped sirloin and steamed veggies and Dad had the steak & rib combo.  Not much else going on.  Tomorrow Dad and I might go to see a movie in the afternoon.

      Thankfully, it is Friday.  Mom and Dad went to the new Marine Federal Credit Union this morning.  Since Dad will retire from Civil Service next April, he wanted to talk to someone about getting an annuity and having his questions answered about his TSP (Thrift Savings Plan).  Dad said everything is set up for next year.  If nothing else, Dad is always prepared for things you CAN prepare for.  At least I don't have to worry about them eating cat food.  Work went well.  I'll be glad to have next Friday off for "Good Friday."  Who knows, I might just make some Easter stuff for Thursday.  Maybe something low-carb.  After work, Mom and I went to the commissary to get stuff for the next two weeks.  Normally we go every week, but since Mom is going to visit my sister Donna in Virginia for two weeks, we got everything Dad and I will need til she returns.  Donna and Krystie arrived about 3:20 this afternoon.  They came to pick Mom up.  Dad will go get her the Friday after Easter.  I might or might not go with him.  I went to Old Navy this afternoon.  I got some great deals during their 10th anniversary sale.  I got two hoodies and two pair of cotton sport shorts.  I christened one outfit after dinner when I wore it running.  I really love shopping at Old Navy, American Eagle, and A&F now that I'm thinner.  Not much else is going on.  Mom, Donna, and Krystie plan on leaving by 5am tomorrow.  That'll get them back up to Alexandria in enough time for Jonathan's birthday party.  You know, I'm going to miss Mom while she's gone.  Her going away is different than when I go to Chicago.  I hope she is careful and has a nice time with the kids.

      Today has felt like Sunday all day.  It's been cloudy and humid all day.  This morning Dad and I went for a walk around the neighborhood.  We walked for about 50 minutes.  I was going to walk a little longer, but Dad said "Hell no, you've walked me long enough!"  We were both soaked to the bone with sweat.  I took Mom and Dad to see  The Day After Tomorrow  at 1:45 this afternoon.  The movie was totally packed.  We got there an hour early, so we had prime seats.  Both loved the movie and was glad I recommended it.  Dad even brought his ear plugs since the movie was somewhat loud.  We had leftovers for dinner tonight.  I had some turkey (white meat), gravy, and green beans.  Dad finished off the dark meat (yuck) and mom made a turkey sandwich.  I really had a craving for the cranberry sauce, but it's too high in sugar.

      It started raining this morning about 9:15 or so.  Now the rain gauge in the back yard says that we've gotten over 2" of rain.  Whew!  We won't be able to deep-fry the turkey for dinner tonight.  Dad has already started roasting the turkey in the oven.  We'll be having turkey, mashed potatoes, corn on the cobb, green beans, gravy, cranberry sauce, and yellow bundt cake with chocolate glaze.  This morning I walked on the treadmill for 45 minutes.  Afterwards, I weighed-in and lost 0.5 pounds but gained 1% bodyfat.  I think I gained the 1% bodyfat because I only walked, and didn't do crunches, pushups, and other exercises.  Fred, Mary, and their boys are coming over for dinner tonight.

      Yesterday I went to see  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow .  At quarter to nine last night, I went to the movies to get a ticket for the 10pm showing.  Surprisingly, they were sold out for that showing, but I did get a ticket for the 10:30 show.  So, I waited around the movie from 8:45-10:30.  The movie was an excellent disaster epic.  It was balanced between funny and sad.  I really was rooting for  urlLink Jake Gyllenhaal .  It might just be because I think he's extremely  gorgeous !  Not much going on today.  Mom and I went to the commissary.  I was a tad upset that they used the majority of the parking lot for a "case-lot" sale.  We couldn't park in the MGySgt spot.  Thankfully, it was mostly empty.  Afterwards, Mom and I went to Belk to see if they had a pair of black slip-on dress shoes to replace my old ones.  My old ones split across the footbed on last Monday.  The local Belk didn't have any in my size, so Mom recommends we go to the Belk in New Bern.  We take a drive up there and, lo and behold, they have a pair of Rockports in my size and in a "non-dorky" style.  Mom said that was my gift for getting the job.  I was most appreciative.

      Less than one month to go before we go to Chicago.  Woo Hoo!  Work went well today.  Not much going on.  I got a card from Marianne officially welcoming me to the Division.  She also sent out an email to all of the others in the Division letting them know about my promotion.  I walked this morning for about 45-50 minutes.  It's good to walk.  I know that walking is better than jogging, but somehow I always feel like I exercised more when I jog.

      Jeeze, I think I'm falling apart.  Ever since Sunday morning, I've had aches and pains.  My right knee and left hip are giving me grief.  It was bad enough to make me not walk or jog on Monday.  Yesterday I walked before work for about 45 minutes.  Since I walked as fast as possible, my hips and shins are aching.  I really wish I had the body of a 21-year-old  urlLink Abercrombie  model.  Work went well today.  I'm working on the new house that I'm going to use for the fall drafting class.  It's basically a variation of my house.  It's hard to believe that a month from today Mom and I will be flying to Chicago to visit Debbie and her brood.  I can't wait!  I'll be there for both the  urlLink Chicago Pride Parade  and  urlLink Taste Of Chicago .

      It's a little after 5pm and I'm sitting here at work.  I have lab hours until my night class begins at 6pm.  Tonight we're going over making walls for the floor plan.  I might get to cover inserting doors and windows.  Work went well today.  When I went home for lunch, Mom and I went to the bank so I could deposit my check from  Key Risk .  They're the company that takes care of workmen's comp claims for the NC Community College System.  They sent me a check for $406 (what I paid for my ambulance).  That's probably all I'm going to get from them.  I don't really mind, because I had to pay the bill anyway.  It's all gravy now.  Tonight is the last night for  PBS'   Colonial House .  I'll be sad to see it end.  I always get so involved in all of these series by  PBS .  The bad thing is that they are so few and far between.

      I got home from my morning lab hours a little after noon.  A few minutes after that I received a phone call from VP Lewis.  I have had him call me three times previously with the news that I hadn't gotten the full-time position.  Fortunately, this time he called to offer me the Full-Time Nine-Month Position with the Architectural Technology Department.  I was SO happy and relieved!  Everything else he talked about whizzed by in a blur.  He asked if I would mind stopping by his office in the afternoon to officially sign my letter of intent.  Needless to say, I got an instant headache!  I mean, I was glad to get the job, but the stress of this journey was difficult.  I'm overjoyed to get the job, yet scared because now all the "powers that be" will be scrutinizing me for the next year.  I have faith that I will rise to the challenge.  Mom was ecstatic!  I thought she would explode.  We called Dad, Debbie, and Donna.  They were all overjoyed as well.  I then called a former student, Susan, who had written me a letter of recommendation.  I owe her and another graduate a lunch.  When I went back to work in the afternoon, I was greeted with hugs from my Divisional Chair, Marianne, and our Secretary, Donna.  Ronnie, the Fire Science instructor, shook my hand and told me it was about time.  In the class, Pat was lecturing to the students.  They didn't know yet.  I went up to the Admin building and signed my letter of intent.  In the meantime, either Marianne or Donna must've gone down to tell Pat to let the students know.  When I returned from "on high", Pat and the students were very congratulatory.  It made me feel very good.  Before he left work, Pat came into the lab and asked if I would mind meeting with him tomorrow at lunchtime.  I said, "I'm all yours for the next nine months."

      I just returned from seeing  Shrek 2  at the local  Carmike  multiplex.  It was a complete sellout in the three theaters it was running in.  Now I know why.  It was an excellent movie!  I honestly think it was better than the original.  In my opinion, the two characters who stole the movie were the  Fairy Godmother  ( Jennifer Saunders ) and  Puss-in-Boots  ( Antonio Banderas ).  They both played pivotal parts in the film.  They were also given wonderfully funny personalities.  It was a shame for the movie to end.  Just don't be the kind of people who leave the theater right at the end.  There are some great stuff during the credits.  The previews before Shrek were excellent.  There are SO many movies I want to see this summer.

      It's Sunday morning and I'm pleasantly surprised after my weigh-in.  After a short jog (35 minutes) I weighed-in to find out that I had lost 2.0 pounds.  I didn't lose or gain any bodyfat.  That makes 99.0 pounds and 28% bodyfat lost since I started Low-Carbing.  In today's paper, the Parade magazine is dedicated to low-carb lifestyles.  It has some great stuff in it.  At noon, Mom and I are going on base to pay my DPP.  Then we're going to JC Penny's so Mom can get some patriotic t-shirts.  Evidently, they're on sale at "ridiculously low prices".  After we're all done with our shopping, I might go to see Shrek 2.

      Just got out of the shower after a 50 minute jog around the neighborhood.  It was still very hot out.  I was soaked when I got back.  The humidity was horrendous!  You could feel the air.  While on my jog, a sweat bee or some other flying insect kept "bugging" me by flying around my sweaty face.  I swatted at it continuously until he flew away.  I know I must've looked like a sight.  My right knee is somewhat sore and kinda twingy.  I hope it's not acting up.  I just took two Tylenol Arthritis after making some sugar-free Kool-Aid (Blastin' Berry Cherry).  Wish me good luck on the weigh-in tomorrow!

      It's a very hot and muggy Saturday.  Mom and I went to the commissary.  When we came home, Dad had already cut the front lawn, but I did have a chance to help him cut the back yard.  During the process, my allergies began acting up.  After the lawn I had a sneezing fit for about 15 minutes.  I took a  Claritin  and a few sprays of  NasalCrom .  Then we all went to Sam's.  We got our routine stuff.  They were doing a fundraiser there for Children's Miracle Network.  The store managers were up on the roof in a tent until they raise $5,000.  I wasn't feeling good when we got back from Sam's.  I began sneezing again and my head felt like it was stuffed full of mashed potatoes.  I was short with Mom, then I decided to go lay down in my bedroom.  I woke up at almost 4pm.  I felt a little bit better.  I woke up in time to help Mom make dinner.  We made "breakfast" for dinner (eggs, bacon, sausage, and hashbrown potatoes).  Right now I'm watching "The In-Law's" remake while I blog.  I need to go jogging.  Lord knows tomorrow won't be a pretty weigh-in if I don't jog both tonight and tomorrow morning beforehand.

      It's Friday evening and the local news is on.  Work went well today.  I had to do computer maintenance on the CAD Lab.  We have 21 computers in the lab.  Eight of them are not working thanks to the crappy computer company who won the bid.  The thirteen other computers needed routine maintenance.  Now we're waiting to see if the other computers die.  Last night was the last night for new students to join my night class.  Luckily, only one new student came.  Now the class is locked in at 5 students.  That's an excellent number.  I cannot wait until we go to Chicago!  We have 36 days before Mom and I go.  My nephew Peter is about ready to bust!  Every night when I chat with him on the computer, he's wishing we're getting there tomorrow.  Me too.  I heard through the grapevine that the committee will be meeting on Monday afternoon.  I hope they make their decision then.  At this point, I just want to know one way or another.  The committee was supposed to meet this afternoon, but they had a schedule conflict.  This waiting is killing me.

      Well, I'm sitting here watching the beginning of the Law & Order season finale.  I just finished watching The West Wing and Smallville finales.  I just hate having to wait until this fall to find out what happens.  I'm such an impatient person!  I recorded the "follow up" episode of Showbiz Moms & Dads.  I'll probably watch it after Law & Order.  I shouldn't, but I know I will.  Today at Target I bought myself an armband radio made by Memorex.  I needed something smaller than either my Walkman cassette or MP3 CD player.  I'll try it out for the first time tomorrow morning when I jog.

      It's Tuesday night.  I'm watching the second night of "Colonial House".  It's an excellent show.  I've been a fan of the entire PBS series.  I just returned from work.  I began my "Architectural Desktop 2004 (Abridged)" night class.  I have 4 students.  Thankfully, the minimum number of students is 4.  I love small classes.  It makes the class more intimate.  Thursday night is the last night that students will be allowed to join the class.  If no new students joined, I'd be happy.

      Ahh, to be off on a Monday.  I love it.  Don't get me wrong, I can't wait to get back to work.  This morning I went for a 40 minute jog.  Then, I came home and I sprung for new haircuts for me and Mom.  Now I'm ready to start back to work.  We also dropped off a blazer and slacks at the cleaners for Dad.  We'll pick them up on Wednesday.  When I returned from my jog this morning, Mom had made an appointment for Dad at the "convenience clinic" on base.  He has some tiny bubbly blisters on his right index finger.  His appointment is for 8pm tonight.  Mom is going with him.  We were joking Dad that his appointment is 30 minutes after his bedtime.  I can't wait until the  "Colonial House"  begins tonight.  It's on your local  PBS  station.  This afternoon, Oprah's episode was about her weekend journey to the "Colonial House."  Her and her friend Gail spent the weekend at the end of their run.

      Stop this see-saw, I wanna get off!  What is the deal with my weight loss?  After a 40-45 minute jog this morning, I weighed in.  Much to my chagrin, I gained 2.5 pounds but lost 1% bodyfat.  To make myself feel better I'm telling myself that since muscle weighs more than fat, I actually lost weight while gaining muscle.  Hopefully, that's the case since last week I worked out more with my power bands, push-ups, ball crunches, etc.  While at  Sam's Club  the other day, I picked up a box of  EAS AdvantEdge Carb Control Bars .  They are very, very good (the "chocolate cream pie" flavor).  It only has 3g impact carbs but 26g protein.  I'm going to use them to replace some of my meals during the upcoming week to see if that helps or hurts me.

      This morning was the college graduation.  It was outside on campus.  It was in the low 80s and sunny.  I was wearing a black gown over my outfit.  By the time the 90 minute ceremony was over, I was soaked through!  It wasn't a pretty picture.  After that I came home and Mom and I went to Belk's to get Dad a new dress shirt and tie for little Donna's graduation.  We got Dad a white long sleeve dress shirt and a black/grey/white diagonally striped tie.  They will go great with Dad's grey slacks and navy blazer.  We grilled out this evening.  Dad grilled kielbasa, brats, and Emeril's new sun-dried tomato sausages.  Mom had regular boiled hot dogs.  We also made chili, kraut, and green beans.  A little while ago, I went on my daily jog.  I made the mistake of forgetting to put little band-aids on my nipples to prevent bleeding.  By the time I was back from my 35 minute jog, my Carolina blue hoodie had blood stains on it.  Right now, I'm washing it after putting the "stain stick" on it.

      It's hard to believe that it's Friday already.  This morning I went for a jog.  Then I came home and Mom and I went to the commissary.  Then, we came home to find out that Dad had killed yet another weed wacker.  After putting the groceries away, Dad came with us to  Sam's Club  and  Lowes .  Dad got a  TroyBilt  weed trimmer.  He was very happy.  I just can't understand how one person can ruin so many weed wackers?!  Mom and I sat out in the back yard for 30 minutes.  I did 15 minutes on my back and stomach.  Mom always does the whole time sitting on the chaise, doing her needlework or crocheting.  I just finished getting my outfit out for tomorrow's graduation.  I'll be wearing black slacks, tan dress shirt, and black tie.  They say we're supposed to be in the mid to upper 80s.  Graduation starts at 10am.  I pray that it isn't too oppressively hot.

      Both this morning and yesterday morning, I went for a jog around the neighborhood.  I absolutely love jogging in the morning.  I didn't get the chance last semester since I had to start at 8:00am.  Now that I'm break, I get to jog in the am before it gets too hot.  Granted, I did jog both days whilst wearing a  hoodie .  That makes me very sweaty by the time I'm done.  I jogged for at least 45 minutes both days.  I don't have a pedometer when I jog, so I don't know how far I've gone.  I just try to jog for at least 45 minutes.  I'm getting lost in all of the minutiae of blogger and customizing it's templates.  There are various ones on the internet, but I haven't found one that suits me.  Yes, I am very picky.

      Well, today was the last day of the semester.  I figured out my grades and turned them into the registrar.  I only had to fail one student.  I always feel bad about failing students.  When I got to my office this morning, my graduation gown was waiting for me.  This Saturday is the graduation of our small second-year group.  Not much else is going on.  I'll probably jog on the treadmill this evening.  Tomorrow, I'll be able to jog around the neighborhood in the morning.  I won't have to worry about waking up early.  Mom and I will be able to sit out in the sun and cook ourselves in preparation for our trip to Chicago.

      Well, it's Monday evening, and I just came to my blog page.  Whoa!  It's all new.  I like the new interface, but I wonder how I'll like everything else.  Today we had a potluck at work.  Both the first- and second-year students brought stuff in.  I brought in "low carb sausage casserole".  Everyone enjoyed it.  A few students even want the recipe.  I feel so proud.  Ironically, that same casserole is what we had on the menu for tonight's dinner.  Mom and Dad both loved the casserole.  It was a hit that I will definitely make again.  Dad had an appointment this afternoon at the Naval Hospital.  He went to see about his plantar wart on his foot.  The doc didn't do anything.  He said Dad was doing the correct thing by using the medicated pads to dissolve it away.  It might take as much as 6 weeks to go away.  Not much else is going on.  Tomorrow is the last day of the semester.  The summer semester starts back up next Wednesday.  My night class begins next Tuesday night.  It'll be an abridged class where I teach Architectural Desktop 2004.  This Saturday, our small group of second-year students are graduating.  Today was the last interview for the job.  I hope they don't take too long before they make a decision.  The anticipation just might kill me!

      To all of the Mother's out there, let me say, "Thank you for bringing us into the world".  Today is your day!  Celebrate!  This morning I went for my first jog outside since I had my little "accident".  I was very careful and only jogged in the road and steered clear of the sidewalks (they are my downfall - literally).  I jogged for a little over 40 minutes.  It was quite invigorating.  After jogging, I was soaked to the bone since I was wearing a hoodie in the warm weather (70s).  I weighed-in and was pleased to see that I had lost 2.5 pounds and 1% bodyfat.  That brings me to 99.5 pounds and 27% bodyfat lost.  I'm SO close to that 100 pound marker.  Not much else going on.  We went to Target and I bought Mom three summer candles: raspberry lemonade, pineapple, and margarita.  I also bought myself 2 CDs:  Anne Murray - The Best ...So Far, and Gary Jules - Trading Snakeoil For Wolftickets.

      Last night, I jogged/walked for 3.35 miles in 45 minutes.  It was very energizing.  Yesterday after work, Mom and I went to the commissary and the package store.  Then, we stopped by Old Navy where I bought 2 tank tops (red w/navy edging and black) in size L and one pair of red nylon athletic shorts in size M.  I sat out in the sun wearing the red outfit.  Mom and I got about 30-45 minutes "sun time".  Neither of us want to be Casper when we go to Chicago.  Today, I helped Dad with the front and back lawn.  He and Mom ran errands this morning.  They picked me up a hummingbird flosser from Oral-B.  It is SO cute!  I tried it this morning after my shower.  It works like a dream and makes flossing enjoyable.

      Today was one of my long days.  When I got home, Dad was already home.  He had taken two hours leave.  It was very warm when I got home.  I thought it was okay.  Our neighbor Mary came down to visit.  We all went to sit on the back patio since Mary wanted to get some sun.  She said she came down here because she didn't want to sun alone and knew we'd sit out back and chat with her.  She's such a hoot!  At work today, I found out that the person who interviewed yesterday afternoon was a woman.  She's the wife of a former Art instructor.  Evidently, she's from Estonia and had a strong accent.  The students also said that she spoke extremely fast.  Another student said she had difficulty using the department's laptop to navigate her Powerpoint presentation.  This afternoon, another woman was supposed to interview.  I don't know anything about this woman.  Next Monday, my student Eugene is interviewing.  I'll keep everyone abreast of the outcome.  It's now almost 80 degrees in the house and in the upper 80s outside.  We turned on the AC and shut all the windows.  Tomorrow we're supposed to get up into the 90s.

      Jeeze, I really didn't want to get up this morning.  I was very grateful for the students and bought them 2 dozen donuts this morning.  They scarfed them up in no time.  After coming home, I went to the Hallmark store to get two Mother's Day cards.  One from me and one from Dad.  I also had to pick up boxed Thank You cards.  I'm going to send them to the committee.  It's the polite and courteous thing to do.  While there, I saw this crystal angel with a mirrored back and a frosted glass "Mother" message.  Once Dad came home, we gave Mom our cards and gift.  Needless to say, Mom got very emotional.  She got all weepy and red-nosed.  This evening, I spent quite a bit of time making 9 recovery CDs for my laptop.  I finally finished that and am blogging while CSI is on.  It's a rerun, but Mom and I haven't seen it.  It was probably one of the ones when The Apprentice was also airing.

      It was a LONG day chock full of anticipation.  My interview wasn't until 3:45.  My last class ended at 3pm.  I was all set up by the time I walked up to VP Lewis' office.  We walked back to the class and had nice banter.  I was amazed that he didn't "un-nerve" me along the way.  I did my teaching demo and I got a few chuckles out of my jokes.  It feels like I "killed."  Then, the students were taken next door to fill out an evaluation.  After that, the committee reviewed my portfolio.  They seemed to like it.  Then, we went to the conference room and had a Q&A session.  They took turns asking me hypothetical and probing questions.  I never know how I do during that part.  Then, VP Lewis talked to me about his role in this process, his expectations of the prospective instructor, etc.  All very mind-numbing.  Lastly, we went back to the office and I had a chat with Marianne, my Divisional Chair.  On the whole, I have good feelings.  The remaining three interviews are Wednesday @ 3:30, Thursday @ 3:45, and Monday @ 3:30.  Not much else is going on.  All I'm doing now is decompressing.  I told my students yesterday, "Don't bother me with anything until after Tuesday."  They laughed and said, "Yeah right."  Those foolish kids!  If only they knew how serious I was.

      Well, never was there a more appropriate song.  The Carpenters hit the nail on the head with that one.  Today was so dreary!  It's 6 in the evening and the sun is just beginning to peek out from behind the receding clouds.  This afternoon I finished my preparations for tomorrow's interview.  I made 20 copies of my "handy handout."  I'll pass that out to the students and the committee at the start of my teaching demo.  I already made a CD of my Powerpoint presentation.  I also just finished putting together my portfolio.  Hell, I even have my outfit picked out.  I'm going to be wearing a navy blue oxford, dress khakis, navy & maroon striped tie, black shoes, and black belt.  Thank you to everyone for your well-wishes.  I hope to do you proud.  I'll just be glad once it's all over.  The other interviews will be Wednesday, Thursday, and Monday afternoons.  I have no idea when the committee plans on making their decision.  I really hope they decide before I go to Chicago.  That way, I'll enjoy my trip without having that in the back of my head.  Mom and I watched the first part of the NBC mini-series "10.5" last night.  It was very good, despite the hokey comic-book like panel fades.  It reminded me of The Hulk movie.  Tonight is the conclusion.

      Well, the weather is humid, gray, and rainy...not unlike my mood.  After walking 3 miles last night and 3 miles this morning, I weighed-in and was disappointed to see that I had gained 1.0 pound and 1% bodyfat.  You know, I just don't understand my body sometimes!  When I feel I've done poorly, I lose weight.  When I feel like I've been "on track", I end up gaining weight.  Right now I'm in the computer room, on the big computer, watching Absolutely Fabulous on Oxygen.  That is one of my favorite shows.  It's wicked humor fits me to a tee.  Later on today, I might go see a movie.

      It's Wednesday morning in Chicago.  Mom and I are on vacation at my sister's house in Evergreen Park.  I usually come to visit twice a year.  For the past few years, they also come to visit North Carolina every Thanksgiving.  We've been having a great time.  The weather has been very cooperative.  My knee is feeling better, albeit a tad sore.  I'm trying to be good on my diet.  I'm only splurging a little (like a trip to Starbucks for frappaccino).  The other night I took Debbie and the boys to see Shrek 2.  Sarah went to see it with her school when it first came out.  This afternoon I'm taking them to see Spiderman 2.  I've been cooking low-carb dinners and everyone seems to be enjoying them.  Tonight we're going to be having "Meatza".  I really love all of the recipes from  urlLink Dana Carpender .  She has wonderful low-carb cookbooks!  I might blog more tonight.  I feel bad when I don't blog, but it's kinda hard when I'm so busy doing "vacation" stuff.

      It's Thursday afternoon and I'm at work all alone.  The lab is dead quiet.  There are also two more dead computers.  One of the new dead computers is the one I use to teach with.  I have no earthly idea what I'm going to do tonight for my last night class!  On the whiteboard I have written:  THURS. 06/24 *LAST CLASS* -DEAD COMPUTERS, COLORING W/CRAYONS!  Speaking of our computers, I came back to work this afternoon and was told that if we send the computers back and get a refund, we'll lose the refund after June 30 (next Wednesday) because of complicated financial "wrangling" used to get them in the first place!  They're telling us that we'll get new computers, but we just don't know when.  I just wanna scream sometimes when I try to fathom the absurdity of the State System!  I'm wearing my stylish black velcro adjustable knee support since I have to be here for night class tonight.  It makes my knee feel more stable.  My knee really doesn't hurt anymore, just the calf muscle under that knee aches.  Who knows, you would have thought that my "unlimited warranty" ran out last week (since I'm falling apart this week).  When I get home tonight I'll pack my suitcase.  Mom told me that she put it in my room to "get it out of the way".  Deciphered, that means "pack tonight or I might just snap!"  When I was getting ready to come back to work, Dad came home early.  He asked me, "Are you planning on using your computer before you leave?"  I told him I'd use the one at work.  He is so anxious to repaint the computer room.  And to do so, he has to take everything out of the room.  Yes, I am scared to think about what Dad might break.  I'll go home tonight and probably find the room bare.

      It's Wednesday afternoon and things are quiet here at work.  I'm in the computer lab all alone, and that's a good thing.  It gives me time to relax, surf the internet, and blog.  I know I should be more diligent in blogging.  This morning my knee didn't feel too bad.  I was worried since I was on my feet for 2.5 hours last night during my night class.  For tomorrow night's class (last class), I'm going to wear my new adjustable knee brace.  Mom got it for me yesterday afternoon at  urlLink Wally World .  Speaking of yesterday at Wally World, Mom also bought the autobiography of Bill Clinton,  urlLink My Life .  It is quite a hefty tome.  Mom is going to get a workout lugging it around.  When I was home for lunch today, Mom and I sat out on the back patio.  Mom was only out there a short time (she said it was "too hot"), but I stayed out there 30 minutes (15 minutes a side).  Tonight after dinner, Mom insists we go to Target to get me new boxers.  I've gotten to the point where I usually just humor Mom.  Here's the skinny on our computer situation at work:  As everyone knows, the computers we got from the lowest bidders in January have been dying left and right.  Our computer techs have been "reviving" the ones we desperately need.  The other 8 computers are sitting dead.  We've been going round and round with the state and the computer company to get them to DO SOMETHING.  Well, this morning when I got to work, Marianne asked if I had read my email she forwarded?  I said I hadn't.  She handed me a copy of an email from the company giving us 2 options... 1.  Box the computers up, send them back, and get our money back... 2.  Have them send a technician to us to fix the dead computers... Pat, Marianne, and I all want to do option 1.  Marianne talked with "the powers that be" and they concur.  So, we'll ship these crappy computers back, and get new computers from whatever company was second to lowest on the bid.  I don't even know what company that is.  Maybe the state will tell us to just get them from  urlLink Xi Computer Corp  (the company we wanted all along).  I might blog more at home, later on tonight since there isn't anything on TV.

      This morning, I called to get an appointment to see Dr. Eldin.  I was shocked to hear that they had an 11:30am appointment.  I was a little surprised to hear my BP was high.  Jean, the nurse, said it was probably due to my injury, or my worrying about it.  Dr. Eldin felt my range of motion and said my joint path was nice and smooth.  He asked loads of questions.  He said it was probably tendon or ligament overuse/strain.  He gave me a prescription for  urlLink Bextra  as well as an 18 day sample of it.  I'm supposed to rest the knees until I get back from Chicago.   I'm just worried about my lack of exercise and related weight gain .  Dr. Eldin said that if the knee isn't better by the time I return from Chicago, to come back and have him write a referral to a Sports Medicine Doctor next door to his office.  Since I didn't go to work for my morning lab hours, Mom and I also got haircuts in preparation for our vacation.  I got mine cut a tad shorter than normal.  I like it.  No muss, no fuss!  When I went back to work this afternoon, all the students asked if I was okay.  I told them the 411.  My Divisional Chair, Marianne, came back from recovering from (cue ironic music) knee surgery.  She said she's feeling much better.  She was in a soft leg brace.  When I was telling her about my knee troubles, she said that I sounded like her problem.  That almost sent me over the edge.  I don't want ANY surgery on something that helps me stay "mobile".

      This morning I didn't walk before my weigh-in.  My right knee is still acting up.  I weighed in and was pleased to see that I lost 1.5 pounds, but no bodyfat.  At this point, I'm just glad that I didn't gain any  more weight.  Me not being able to walk or jog is really a bummer.  I think I'm going to try and get an appointment with Dr. Eldin this week.  I need to do something about my knees (especially my right knee).  It isn't inflamed, just very tender.  There aren't any sharp pains, just a dull ache.  It feels like my right knee is going to "give out".  Last night I went to see Garfield.  It was a good movie.  Granted, it wasn't an Oscar winning movie, but it was cute and in keeping with the books by Jim Davis.  I might go to see another movie today.  I want to see either The Terminal or Dodgeball.  For dinner, we're having meatloaf, au gratin potatoes, gravy, and two veggies.  Yesterday, Mom and I gave Dad his Father's Day cards and gifts.  I bought Dad the new live Celine Dion CD and a bag of the mini-KitKat in three flavors (milk, white, and dark chocolate).  Mom got Dad the largest bottle of Stetson cologne.

      The weather is cloudy and humid.  It was threatening to rain all day, but it didn't start raining until about 6:30 tonight.  It's just a light rain.  I hope I don't get any thunderstorms tonight.  Mom and Dad left for Virginia this morning at about 5am.  I tried to get back to sleep, but I couldn't get back into deep sleep.  I drifted in and out of light sleep.  Work went well.  I had to load some software on two computers that died yesterday.  Dad called a little after 11 this morning to let me know that they got up to Donna's house.  They were going to check-in this afternoon.  I hope they have a good time at little Donna's graduation tonight.

      You know, when I lost my weight, I was supposed to have less knee problems.  Ha, that's a laugh!  I just wish the  "knee fairy"  would come and replace both of my bum knees.  I didn't walk this morning.  My knees were hurting.  I'm hoping that it's due to the wet weather we've been having.  Hell, I wouldn't mind having double knee replacement surgery.  My master plan is this:  First, I need to get the federal government to recognize same-sex marriage;  Second, I need them to also accept gays in the military (openly);  Finally, I need to marry a hunky Marine so I can get me ID Card back.  See, it's not too bad.  Hell, I'd have better luck trying to raise the dead!!  Since I haven't been as active, thanks to my geezer knees, I have been eating and snacking less.  I hope it works.

      I am despondent beyond measure.  After Dad and I walked around the neighborhood for 53 minutes, I weighed-in.  I gained 2.0 pounds and 3% bodyfat.  I'm going in the wrong direction and I just want to cry.  I think I might have to go back on the Atkins "Induction" phase.  I don't know what else to do to reverse this trend.

      This morning, instead of just Mom and I going to the commissary, Dad went with us!  Now, don't think that he wanted to go shopping with us, he just went to get his haircut.  The barber is next to the commissary.  After Dad got his haircut, he joined us for the rest of our shopping.  When we were checking out, the checker (one of our regular checkers) was all up in arms about how the commissary was open yesterday during Reagan's funeral.  Apparently, the base said the commissary would be closed, then changed it's mind and said they'd be open.  We also went to Sam's to get our "essentials".  Just the regular stuff.  Since Dad has been saying that he wanted to see  urlLink Troy , I decided to treat him for Father's Day.  It was a great movie, albeit a tad long.  There were only 12 people in the theater.  I was pleased to see all the muscular eye-candy in the film (Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom).  We came home and Mom was listening to her new  urlLink Daniel O'Donnell  CD.  She has all of his CDs.  I think he sounds like an Irish country singer.  But hey, Mom loves him so that's all that matters.  Dinner was pretty much "go for yourself".  Since we didn't have a structured dinner, I decided to go back to the movies to see  urlLink The Stepford Wives .  It was an absolute riot!   urlLink Roger Bart  and Bette Midler stole the show!  Tomorrow I want to see Garfield.

      I hate my damn knees!  This morning, I was going to walk on the treadmill, or maybe even outside (since it was beautiful this morning).  My right knee had other plans.  When I got up, my knee was "achey".  I didn't walk, lest I aggravate my condition.  Work went well.  The only bad thing was that another computer died.  That makes 10 computers dead.  Supposedly, we're going to have a conference call on Monday afternoon with the company, the state, and us.  If the computer company can't rectify the situation, the state might make them take back the computers and we'd go to the second company on the list.  Tomorrow is the funeral for former President Ronald Reagan.  Since I'll be at work, I plan on watching it live via the internet on  urlLink C-SPAN .

      I was watching  Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn  last night on Comedy Central.  One of the guests was Carrot Top.  During the episode, Colin kept mentioning that Carrot Top was "ripped."  He browbeat both Carrot Top and Rich Vos into taking off their shirts and showing off their physiques.  When Carrot Top took off his long-sleeved red plaid shirt,  POW !  I was greeted with a funny comedian with a jacked-up physique.  He had luscious pecs and huge biceps!  I was taken back.  I'm a sucker for muscle, and boy, does Carrot Top have it.

      It's Wednesday night and I'm pleasantly surprised to see new episodes of  The Drew Carey Show  on ABC.  I'm watching the second episode.  When I got home from work, the State Funeral for former President Ronald Reagan was just beginning.  Mom was recording it.  We watched it while I made  "low-carb Joe"  for dinner.  I can't get over how small and fragile Nancy Reagan looks now.  It's almost like she's gotten more frail since President Reagan died.  This morning I walked on the treadmill for 35 minutes while I watched  The Today Show .

      It's Monday night and I was a terrible slacker!  In the morning, I usually either walk around the neighborhood or walk on my treadmill.  For some reason, this morning I didn't walk.  I think it was mainly due to the dreary, humid weather.  It was also probably because I needed a "mental-health" day.  I've been walking for over two weeks straight and sick and tired of not seeing any weight loss.  Work went well.  I didn't want to go back this afternoon.  Mom and I were watching MSNBC and we were watching the Reagan family go to the library in Simi Valley for the family service.  Tonight for dinner, we had hot dogs and polish sausage.  Mom and Dad also had macaroni and cheese.  They also had buns, of course.

      This morning I walked around the neighborhood for 62 minutes.  Afterwards, I weighed-in an was disappointed to see that I had gained 1.0 pounds.  On the plus side, I lost 1% bodyfat.  I know, I know, that usually means that I gained muscle and lost fat.  I just hate seeing my scale bob up and down.  I just want it to go steadily down.

      Last night, I was SO disgusted with nothing on television, I went to bed at 9pm.  I missed Debbie's phone call at 9:30.  She told Mom all about her appointment at Northwestern.  This afternoon, I talked to her and she told me how everything went.  She's on her way to possibly getting gastric bypass.  Her doctor is more concerned, however, with her high blood pressure and high cholesterol.  She might also have acid reflux and sleep apnea.  Jeeze, she's in bad shape (wink, wink, nudge, nudge)!  Irregardless, I love her with all my heart and soul.  This morning, Mom and I went to the commissary while Dad mowed the lawns.  Afterwards, Mom went and took about a 1-hour nap.  During that time, I went to see if I could get a ticket to see Harry Potter.  This was at a little before noon.  All of the early shows were already sold out.  I bought a ticket for the 4pm show.  The movie was an excellent one.  I preferred this movie to the previous two.  It had an elegantly dark look with just the right amount of biting humor.  The young stars are growing into their adulthood nicely.  I was sad to see that Maggie Smith had such a small role in this outing.  I hope her role in the next movie is expanded.  When I came home, I noticed that Dad had the American flag at half-mast.  I had a feeling that something was wrong.  When I came in the den I said, "What happened?  Why is the flag lowered?"  Dad told me that President Reagan had passed away.  Despite the fact that I'm a died in the wool Democrat, I was saddened to hear that Reagan had passed.  My only consolation is that he is in a better place, out from under the iron grip of Alzheimer’s disease.  I pray that none of my family are ever touched by it.

      I'm waiting desperately to hear from my sister Debbie.  She had an appointment this morning at  urlLink Northwestern Memorial Hospital .  It's also the same hospital her husband, Robert, works.  Her appointment is to evaluate her for gastric-bypass surgery.  She said she'd call Mom to let her know how it went.  Mom, in turn, said she'd call my cell phone to let me know.  The waiting is killing me.  I know Debbie wants the surgery, but I'm  SO  apprehensive about potential complications.   urlLink Northwestern Memorial Weight Management - Bariatric Surgery

      We're supposed to have an 80% chance of rain and thunderstorms today.  It's raining right now.  The  Queen  is  NOT  amused!  I hate the rain, even though we need it desperately.  Last night, I had an EAS AdvantEdge bar before night class.  I also had over a liter of water.  Boy were my back teeth floating.  Night class went well.  I think I might have a dropout in the class.  One of my five students has been absent for the last 2 classes.  I haven't heard anything from her, either.  When I got home from night class last night, I had some mixed nuts and a breadless roast beef & cheese sandwich.  You're probably thinking, "How the hell can he have a breadless sandwich?"  I'll explain; I took a slice of American cheese, then put some deli roast beef on top, then a tad bit of mayo, then I folded the cheese like it was a taco shell.  Voila!  This morning I walked on the treadmill for 42 minutes and 2.75 miles.  I tried to keep my pace at 4.0 miles.  Afterwards I had my usual breakfast of an EAS AdvantEdge bar.  I think I'm getting addicted to the Wal-Mart  Clear American  flavored water.  I usually buy them in the one-liter bottles and drink them at work.  Right now I'm about 1/2 finished with a  Blackberry Apple .  After I finish it, I'll go to the water fountain and fill the bottle up with cold water.  Needless to say, my kidneys are getting a workout!

      Boy, am I full!  When I came home for lunch, Dad was already home.  Him and Mom went to get the truck inspected.  They're also going to Sam's to get Dad some water for work.  I guess he felt left out when Mom and I went yesterday.  I came home and decided to make a green salad.  Mom had boiled some eggs for me to put in the salad.  I made it with: bagged salad, cucumbers, celery, tomatoes, chopped egg, and shredded mozzarella cheese.  For my bowl, I also added low-carb Italian dressing and crumbled bacon.  After that, I had the leftover meatballs and low-carb sauce from last night's dinner.

      Well, I'm almost off to work.  I just thought I'd stop in and jot down what I've done this morning.  I plan on keeping a better track on my food and exercise.  I walked on the treadmill this morning while I was watching the Today show.  I walked for 2.25 miles at a pace of 3.8-4.2mph.  After walking, I had my breakfast, which was an EAS AdvantEdge bar (chocolate peanut butter).  I've also had 2 bottles of Fruit2O so far.  I'm off to work.  I'll write more after lunch.

      I cannot take this stultifying boredom.  Summer is the vast wasteland of reruns.  The days are merely running together.  This morning I walked for over 50 minutes.  Just like yesterday.  Walking for over 45 minutes makes me feel SO much better.  It lets me clear my head.  And it is good for me (groan).  Work went well today.  When I was home during my lunch break, Mom and I ran some of my errands.  I went to  urlLink Sam's Club  to get  urlLink EAS AdvantEdge  bars, fully cooked burgers, and fully cooked chicken breasts.  Then I went to  urlLink GNC  to get my  urlLink Twinlab Ripped Fuel Extreme Cut .  It seems to be working, and for less than Hydroxycut.  Tonight for dinner, we had spaghetti and meatballs.  Of course, I had chicken breasts covered in sauce along with a few meatballs.

      Well, I took Mom to see  The Village  earlier this evening. I liked it very much. Mom wasn't so happy since it wasn't a  classic  monster movie.  First of all, let me say that I would categorize the movie as"A Merchant-Ivory period piece/morality play like the  Crucible  or the  Lottery /and an old  Twilight Show  episode".  The acting was above average. You could tell that some of the actors strained against the reigns. Adrien Brody was excellent in his portrayal of "Noah". I was disappointed in the lack of use of Sigourney Weaver's talents.  The visual style was miraculous. Cinematography, set decoration, and wardrobe were indulgent. The music was great, if only a little "heavy handed" at times when M. Night wanted to  really  emphasize something.  Overall, I am glad that we saw the movie, but I'm even more glad that we saw it during a matinee showing.

      It's a quiet Friday afternoon at work. I had to substitute for Pat this morning. I think he is in Asheville for a bike race. I helped the students with their framing plan that was due today. Some of them were done, and some were totally clueless and hadn't even started.  After I get off work, I told Mom that I was taking her to the 3:45 showing of  urlLink The Village . We are both so eager to see it. Mom is excited because she loves anything scary or suspenseful. I'm excited to see any movie from M. Night Shyamalan.  Last night before John Kerry made his acceptance speech, I walked on the treadmill for 2.0 miles (while watching  Extreme Makeover ). I was bowled over by John Kerry's speech! I cannot wait until he wins the election and corrects the course that Bush has forged.  Later on tonight I'll write about going to the movies with Mom. We're supposed to have fish and fries for dinner tonight. I'm not sure we will, though. Dad's not a big fan of fish, and I can't really eat breaded fish portions like I'd like. We'll see.  I am such a  Big Brother  fan. Mom and I faithfully watch it every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. I also read the live feed transcripts on  urlLink BigBrotherUpdates . Last night's HOH competition was an "endurance" challenge. The episode ended before we found out who won HOH. If you go to the link, you can find out like I did!

Today was a very rainy day.&nbsp; It was also as humid as the rain forest.&nbsp; I think that's why my right knee is aching.&nbsp; When I came home from work tonight, I had to take two Tylenol Arthritis.&nbsp; I might not walk on the treadmill tonight, even though I should.   At work, I've been getting ready for the upcoming semester.&nbsp; Just before I began to blog, I finished updating my syllabi.&nbsp; I'll be teaching four day classes, one night class, and one online class.&nbsp; I'll be a busy bee this fall.&nbsp; I'll just be happy once my benefits kick in (medical & dental insurance, 401k, etc.).   Tonight is the two-hour premiere of UPN's  urlLink Amish in the City .&nbsp; As a plus, last night  urlLink Trio  showed Devil's Playground, a documentary about the Amish rite of rumspringa.&nbsp; Since my father's side of the family hails from Pennsylvania's Amish/Mennonite/Quaker area, I've always been fascinated about those cultures.

      I just got out of the shower.&nbsp; Before that, I was walking on the treadmill.&nbsp; I walked for 40 minutes (2.0 miles) while watching MSNBC's coverage of the Democratic National Convention.&nbsp; President Carter gave an impassioned speech.&nbsp; Now I'm listening to Senator Clinton introducing President Clinton.&nbsp; I hope and pray with all my heart that John F. Kerry becomes the next President.   Tomorrow I have to substitute for Pat.&nbsp; I'll also sub for him Thursday afternoon and Friday morning.&nbsp; He's using up some of his leave before his wife has to go back to work teaching.&nbsp; During my short lunch break, I plan on mailing two packages: one to my sister Debbie and one to my niece Donna.&nbsp;&nbsp;They both have&nbsp;copies of the three CDs I bought at Target.    urlLink The Killers -Hot Fuss   urlLink The Rasmus -Dead Letters   urlLink Keane -Hopes And Fears   I love them all.&nbsp; The great thing is that all three of them were on&nbsp;sale.&nbsp;

      This morning I was blown away when I weighed-in.&nbsp; This is my biggest  "whoosh" .&nbsp; In case you're wondering, a  "whoosh"  is an unexpected weight loss.&nbsp; I lost  6.5  pounds and  1%  bodyfat.&nbsp; That makes  105.5  pounds lost.&nbsp; Now I have one reason to thank Donna, Dennis, and Jason.&nbsp; Their arrival caused me to hole up in my bed after dinner, causing me to abstain from snacking.   I wonder how Debbie is doing keeping her normally outside dog, Sergei, in the house?&nbsp; His ears were so eaten up that they couldn't keep him outside anymore.&nbsp; I'm taking bets on how long it will last.

Mom and I went to the commissary.&nbsp; We also went to Wal-Mart in the middle of a thunderstorm.&nbsp; For dinner, I treated Dad to  urlLink Jersey Mike's Subs  and Mom & I to  urlLink Wendy's .&nbsp; We didn't have anything on the menu because we weren't sure when they would leave.   Tomorrow is weigh-in.&nbsp; I am a tad apprehensive since I didn't walk on the treadmill or around the neighborhood.&nbsp; But then again, I haven't been eating after dinner for a few days.&nbsp; We'll see.

      It's Thursday evening and I'm holed up in my bedroom.&nbsp; I absolutely hate my life right now.&nbsp; Lest you get worried that I'm suicidal, let me assuage your fears.&nbsp; I wouldn't kill myself because I'm so self-conscious about being found dead.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, it's much better to be homicidal.   It's been 5 days since big Donna dropped off her three kids.&nbsp; Most of the time has been great.&nbsp; Things, however, have begun to grate on my every last nerve.&nbsp; One of my nieces is prone to whining and bickering.&nbsp; My nephew has become annoying to the extreme.&nbsp; He reminds me more and more of  "Eddie Haskell"  from  Leave It To Beaver .&nbsp; And earlier this evening, after dinner, he took almost 20 minutes to brush his teeth.&nbsp; Now, I'm all for good oral hygiene, but this was ridiculous (especially the grating spitting).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, after Dad and I played UNO with them, he went and spent another eternity re-brushing.&nbsp; I snapped and asked, "Why the hell are you brushing again?"&nbsp; His smarmy answer was, "I just drank a soda."&nbsp; My head felt like it would explode!   My sister is having problems with their rental property down here.&nbsp; The tenants seem to have skipped out and left the house trashed.&nbsp; Yesterday, she came down with her husband and brother-in-law to fix things up since they don't want to pay anyone else to do it.&nbsp; Now it's 10:48pm and I'm waiting for the three of them to come here to flop here for the night.&nbsp; They didn't sleep here last night.&nbsp; They stayed at a hotel that they claim was "outrageous".&nbsp; Of course, since Mom is such a soft touch, she said they could stay here in addition to their three kids and us three already here.&nbsp; That'll make 9 sleeping here tonight.   I cannot wait to go to work tomorrow!&nbsp; I hate the fact that I have to escape from my own house.&nbsp; I shouldn't have to.&nbsp; I really need some psycho medication!&nbsp; All will be well when things are back to their normal routine.&nbsp; No need calling the authorities because you think me a danger to myself or others.&nbsp; I'll just be sitting here on my bed, rocking back and forth, calmly reciting to myself   "Serenity Now!"

       Man I absolutely hate this!!!&nbsp; I was just blogging.&nbsp; I mean, like 7-9 paragraphs.&nbsp; Then I went to do a spell check before posting.&nbsp; My damn computer froze on me.&nbsp; I had to reboot my computer, so now I've lost my previous blog. &nbsp; Now I have to remember what all I blogged.  &nbsp;  Let's recap yesterday since I didn't blog.&nbsp; I took  11930  steps yesterday.&nbsp; That was amazing.&nbsp; I chalk it up to my walking on the treadmill (1.5 miles/30 minutes) during  urlLink Will&amp;Grace  and me going all over the CAD Lab while I was at work.&nbsp; The reason I was all over the Lab was becasue I had to reload  urlLink Architectural Desktop  on four computers that had died and were resurrected.&nbsp; Of course, the four computers were spread out across the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus far today, I've logged  5906  steps.  &nbsp;  Work went well.&nbsp; After work, Mom and I went to the commissary.&nbsp; If you remember, one of my students works as a cashier there and told me that one of the guys who works in the office is gay.&nbsp; She told me at work that she found out he was 20.&nbsp; Man, that means he was born when I was 13!!&nbsp; It made me feel like a cradle robber.&nbsp; Anywhoooo, Courtney told me to come to her checkout today so the guy could  "get a look at me"  and see if I was too old or not.&nbsp; We checked out&nbsp;at her lane, but I dunno if he saw me or not.&nbsp; She tried to point him out to me, but I didn't get a good look.&nbsp; It must've been my bad, aged&nbsp;eyes (biting sarcasm)!  &nbsp;  We're waiting to see when Donna, Dennis, and the kids are leaving Virginia to come down.&nbsp; Unbelievably, they haven't left yet.&nbsp; I thought they would leave once Donna &amp; Dennis got home from work.&nbsp; Hell, I was just IMing with little Donna and Krystie.&nbsp; They say Dennis is sleeping and when he wakes up and packs, then they'll leave.  &nbsp;  While at work today, I told everyone that I was going to take Monday and Tuesday off so I could spend time with the kids.&nbsp; To listen to the students, you would've thought I was abandoning them or something.&nbsp; Well, when Donna and Marianne heard about my days off, they told me I ruined their plans for Monday.&nbsp; So, they gave me my card/gift this afternoon.&nbsp; In my card was a book of gift certificates from  urlLink Carmike Cinemas .&nbsp; I got the same thing last year and was SO glad to get it again!&nbsp; I'll probably use them to take the kids to the movies while they're here.

      It's another Wednesday night and I'm sitting here in the den while Mom watches something on A&E.  I have  3405  steps on my pedometer so far for today.  Last night I walked on the treadmill for 30 minutes (1.5 miles).  That gave me  7941  steps for yesterday.  We watched  urlLink Big Brother 5  and  urlLink Queer Eye For The Straight Guy  (UK version) last night.  On BB5, I really like Will, the gay RN.  I hope that Mike gets evicted tomorrow.  Queer Eye was great!  I loved the  urlLink UK version  almost as much as the original.  The "translations" for Americans made me feel spoonfed.  I am quite the connoisseur of British programming on PBS and BBC America.  I also liked that the episode was evenly divided among the Fab 5.  The tall blond was a cross between Prince William & Simon LeBon.  Today was quiet and uneventful.  Pat is almost done with our new bid for the computers to replace our crappy "new" ones.  One of our students, Courtney, works at the commissary on base and is trying to pimp me out to any of the gay guys who also work there.  The bad thing is that 98% of them are young, like 20 years old.  Hell, that's 13 years younger than me.  I'd feel like a dirty old gay guy.  I felt kinda "blah" when I came home from work tonight.  I made dinner (meatza), then watched the DVD Mambo Italiano.  It was a good movie.  It wasn't as funny as some gay movies, but better than many non-gay movies.  Another plus was that it was a Canadian production.  Today was  Bastille Day .  I am glad that France now is a democracy and no longer a dictatorial monarchy.  We might not have the best relationship with France, but it is my country twice removed.  My maternal grandmother was from Quebec, and her family was certainly originally from France.

      It's Monday evening and humid as hell!  We got some rain this afternoon.  Work went well.  Mom and I went to Winn-Dixie at lunch time to get some stuff for dinner.  While there I wanted to look for Diet Rite Black Cherry soda.  Of course they didn't have it.  So while browsing around I noticed that in the Latino food they had  urlLink Canfield's Diet Chocolate Fudge and Diet Cherry Chocolate Fudge  soda.  I thought they only carried it in Chicago.  As a matter of fact, I got some last time I was there.  So, I bought a six-pack of each.  Not much else is going on.  I didn't wear my pedometer yesterday, but I did today.  It "claims" that I've taken 2729 steps so far today.  That's a crock.  But I'm so much of a penny-pincher I'll keep on wearing it so I can convince myself I'm getting my money's worth.  Today was the anniversary of  urlLink Hurricane Bertha .  Back in 1996 on this day, Bertha landed just south of Jacksonville.  That was the start of a bad year for hurricanes for eastern NC.

      Mom and I took the truck down to Wilmington to shop at the new Kohl's and the new Mayfaire Town Center.  At Kohl's, I bought two pairs of cargo shorts (size 31) and two tshirts (size L)!  I am SO excited about the size 31!  Here is a pic of me in one of the outfits:   Also at Kohl's, Mom bought Dad two patriotic tshirts.  Then we drove over to Hecht's in the new Mayfaire Town Center.  We didn't buy anything, just browsed.  Then we went to Barnes&Noble.  For some odd reason, the store smelled odd.  It was reminiscent of mildew and sewage.  Needless to say, we didn't stay long and I didn't purchase anything.  I long to go back to shop in the William-Sonoma, Pier 1 Imports, and all the other outdoor shops.  It's very similar to other "outdoor shopping malls" or "lifestyle centers" like Old Orchard in Skokie, IL and Short Pump Town Center in Richmond, VA.  I like this trend more than the massive enclosed malls of the 80s.  Coming home, Mom and I hit a massive thunderstorm that was ravaging Jacksonville and heading southwest along the coast.  Brynn Marr was flooded and many trees were down.  Just as I suspected, Dad had his rain slicker and Sneads Ferry sneakers on cleaning out the two storm drains to stop the street from flooding up into the yards.  Did anyone else help?  Nope.  Did the drivers slow down when they drove through the standing water on the road?  Nope.  People can be SO inconsiderate!

      It's morning on an extremely muggy Sunday.  I just weighed in.  I gained 1.0 pounds but lost 2% bodyfat.  I'm not overjoyed about it, but I am glad that I lost bodyfat.  Mom and I are thinking of driving down to Wilmington to go shopping at the new  urlLink Kohl's  and  urlLink Hecht's .  It'll also give us a chance to check out the new Mayfaire Town Center.  Supposedly, there's a huge new Barnes&Noble located there.

      I just finished watching two DVDs from Blockbuster.  After dinner, Dad and I went up to see if there were any movies worth renting.  I rented 4 movies: Cold Mountain, Secret Window, Mystic River, and Mambo Italiano.  We all watched Cold Mountain and then Dad went to bed while Mom and I watched Secret Window.  Dad plans on watching Mystic River in the morning before Mom and I get up since we have no desire to see it.  Mambo Italiano is a funny gay movie that I have been wanting to see since it came out on DVD.  Nothing much else is going on.  Today we had to get the Mercury's brakes replaced.  Since we returned from Chicago, I've noticed that I've had to press the brake pedal almost all the way down to the floor.  The brake pedal also "felt funny" when I braked.  After going to Sam's, Dad and I dropped the Mercury off at Meineke.  They replaced the brakes and rotors.  Now were ready to stop on a dime.  I am SO sick of hearing about the "Federal Marriage Amendment".  You know, last time the government used the constitution to prohibit something, we were subjected to Prohibition.   Let me see if I can remember, did that last very long??   Besides, the institution of marriage isn't all it's cracked up to be.

      Yesterday I took  6889  steps.  So far today, I've walked  3062  steps.  Sometimes I think that the pedometer misses steps if I walk softly.  I usually walk lightly.  I never understood people who tromp around.  I just returned from the movies.  I went to see  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  at 7:10.  I was shocked:  1. it was playing in this military town 2. it was a packed theater this long after it's release  It was a great movie.  It was both funny and touching.  It opened my eyes further than I thought they could be.  I was never a fan of "W" and now am vehemently opposed to anything related to Georgie-boy!  I wish every Democrat and Independent voter go see the movie.  I would even love it if you could persuade a Republican to see the movie with you.

      It's Friday afternoon and I'm here at work.  Nothing much going on.  Pat just left after printing off some drawings.  One of the students, Stuart, is here working on his English stuff.  They have a "graphics portfolio" they have to do.  It's letters, memos, pie charts, graphs, etc.  Last night I walked on the treadmill while I watched  urlLink CSI .  I didn't walk fast and yet my knee still was aching afterwards.  I even wore my brace.  Then, I took a hot bath and put some  urlLink Aspercreme  on it.  Today it seems to be back to it's normal "gimpy" state.  I was surprised as hell last night when I got a call from my oldest niece.  At first I thought something was wrong since she never calls to talk to me (we usually just chat on the AIM).  She has started The South Beach Diet and was asking me about my low-carb eating.  Basically, what I can and can't eat.  I feel for her because I know how hard it is for her, especially since everyone else in her house eats LOTS of carbs.  I told her that when she and her siblings come down for a week (next week), I'll help her do low-carb.

      Today has been one of those days when you're like, "What?...When?...Huh?"  I've been kinda out of it all day.  Yesterday, I took  9049  steps.  That was with my 40 minute walk around the 'hood.  Today I haven't walked as much as I should've.  As of 8:20pm, I have  4561  steps.  I also didn't walk after dinner.  I don't want to overexert my knee.  Speaking of my knee, I picked up my Bextra from Eckerd Drugs this afternoon.  I wasn't too shocked to see a 30 day supply of 10mg priced at 101 dollars.  I'll just have to be frugal in medicating myself.  Jeeze, I sound like one of those elderly people who talk about whether to eat or get medication.  Everything else was quiet today.  Mom and I went to Wally-World after getting my meds.  I had to get some "Clearly American" carbonated water and Hood Carb Countdown yogurt and smoothies.  Today at work, I had to chose the payment plan I wanted for my salary for the upcoming year.  Since I am Nine-Month Faculty, I can choose to get either 9 paychecks or 12.  I chose 12.  That way I won't have to go three months without pay.  Surprisingly, it doesn't drop my pay that much.

      Today was my first day back to work.  I was glad to return to my usual "routine".  I did get up later than usual this morning.  That was one consolation.  My total for my first day using my pedometer (yesterday) was 4641 steps.  That was from about 1:00pm until about 11:00pm.  Right now, my pedometer has 4422 steps on it and it's only 7:00pm.  I might walk up to the post office to check my mail after I blog.  That should help.  This afternoon, when I was home for lunch, I sat out on the back patio for 40 minutes (20 minutes a side).  By the end of that time, I was soaked through in sweat.  It got up to 96 degrees here in Jacksonville.  The heat index was over 100.  Tomorrow is going to be the same.  Work went well.  Pat and Marianne were telling me that we've been given the "okay" to re-bid for the computers.  Pat said he will make the bid SO specific that only our favored company will want to bid on it.  I hope that's the case.  I just wonder how long we'll be using the "old" computers.  Granted, they're more stable, but they're running the old version of Architectural Desktop.  Not much else going on.  I'm off to walk around the neighborhood with my knee brace on.

      It's Monday, yet it feels like Sunday.  This morning, I got up at 8:30am and weighed in after reading the paper.  I was amazed to see that I had lost 2.5 pounds but gained 1% bodyfat.  I have now lost 100.5 pounds and 24% bodyfat!  I'm just glad to be past that 100 pound sticking point.  I think it was all of the running around in Chicago coupled with me not snacking at night.  All of us went to  urlLink Sam's Club  and  urlLink Eckerd Drugs  this morning.  Mom dropped off two rolls of film at the one-hour photo place.  I tried to drop off my prescription for Bextra, but the pharmacy was closed today at Eckerd.  They probably were open yesterday.  I'll just have to drop it off tomorrow on my way to work.  Mom and I went to Hallmark to get a whole mess of cards for July events.  I used my 20% off birthday card from them.  We also went to Target to get me a pedometer and some candles.  Mom bought Dad some cargo shorts for him to wear to work.  He's too hot working in jeans.  He's the last worker in TMO (I think) to wear shorts to work.  I don't know why he didn't wear them sooner.  My  urlLink pedometer  isn't too sensitive.  It's not picking up all of my steps.  I hope it gets better over the next day or two.  The thing that sucks is that it cost 18 dollars!  They had a cheaper one that just counted steps, but I opted for the one that counts calories, steps, and distance.  We just finished dinner.  We had an old-fashioned cookout.  Dad grilled boneless beef ribs, smoked sausage, and Hebrew National dogs.  We also boiled some regular dogs for Mom.  Mom made her famous macaroni salad for her and Dad.  I also cooked broccoli and cauliflower.  It was very yummy.  Dad did an excellent job repainting my computer room while we were in Chicago.  It is SO white.  I like it very much.  I think he's going to do the other rooms just like it.  The only think I had to do was put everything back on my bookcase and reconnect my computer and portable phone.

      Well, it's Monday evening and Mom and I are safely back in the Tarheel State.  Yesterday was crazy!  We got up early and got everything ready to go home.  I didn't eat anything before getting on the plane.  Before we left Debbie's, Mom and I played cards with Peter and Sarah.  We played Go Fish (or as Sarah calls it, "Goldfish") and Old Maid.  Unfortunately, Peter was the Old Maid all three hands we played.  Debbie got up early and drove us to Midway.  We were there two hours early since we thought security was going to be that much tighter, due to the holiday.  Nope, same routine as usual.  My Birkenstocks set off the metal detector, so I had to go through barefoot.  Believe me, they need to clean that linoleum floor a little better.  After that, we went to the Chicago store in concourse B to get Dad some pins for his hat.  We were the seventh and eighth person to check into our flight.  Mom was disappointed that they weren't filming anyone for the A&E show,  urlLink Airline .  We had a restful flight without incident and landed at RDU on time.  Dad was overjoyed to have us back.  We claimed our bags and drove home.  We hit a little bit of rain, but made it home before 7pm.  I love going to visit Debbie, but I like it even more when I return home.  I had a wonderful time and long to visit again.  I hope she and the kids had a good time while we were there.  Mom is supposed to fly back to Chicago when Debbie has her bariatric surgery (when and if that is).  After eating and soaking in a nice hot tub, we all watched the fireworks specials from Washington and Boston.  Dad went to bed a little after 9pm and I went to bed about 10:15pm.  I fell right to sleep and slept the sleep of the dead!

      Today was a beautiful and hot day on the south side of Chicago.  We didn't do too much.  Michael went on a job interview at a local banquet hall.  He should hear something next week.  Peter had summer band this morning.  We went to Wal-Mart, then Wendy's for lunch.  This afternoon, we went to Border's to get some books.  I got two books and two magazines.  I also bought Debbie two books.  Everyone also got sugar-free Kaluha mochas at the cafe.  Now, I'm making dinner: smoked pork chops, noodles, two veggies, and white gravy.  Oh, yesterday afternoon, we went to see Spiderman 2.  It was excellent!  I actually think it was better than the original.

      It is a brilliant blue out and the sun is shining. The humidity is low and there is a gentle breeze. Ah, if only every day was like this!  Last night, Mom and I went to Belk. She insisted on getting me three dress shirts (burgundy, red, and green) for work. I also got three pairs of socks. This morning after we went to the commissary, Mom and I went to Old Navy. I bought three pairs of pants (black, khaki, and stone) and two belts (black and brown). Boy, I sure do love the Tax-Free Weekend! The only bad thing is that I wanted to buy some computer software. Unfortunately, I found out that software is no longer exempt. Isn't that always the case?

      It's Friday afternoon and we just opened up all the windows and shut off the A/C. It's 78 degrees with only 56% humidity. That is  SO  much better than what it has been. It almost feels like the beginning of fall. Unfortunately, this cool and dry weather is supposed to end on Monday.  Today was the last day for our students this semester. Monday they have an English final. I'll go in to work on Monday morning to turn in some paperwork, then I'm off until Friday the 13th. That's New Faculty Orientation. It's from 9am until 4pm. Woo Hoo! Then, the following Monday and Tuesday are our Fall Workshops. Yippee!  Last night while Mom and I were watching Big Brother 5, I made a low-carb berry cobbler (for us) and a low-carb grasshopper pie (for work). Dad and I like the cobbler. Mom hasn't had any yet. The kids descended on the pie like locusts! It was gone in a flash. They said it was good, but  a)  it needed to be more minty and  b)  it had an aftertaste. I told them,  "Hey, beggars can't be choosers!"

      It's Thursday afternoon and I'm at work. Tomorrow the students have their semester design project due. More kids stayed for lab today than any other day this semester. Why am I not surprised?? If only they paced themselves throughout the semester, they wouldn't have to stay late at the end. Hell, about three of them also plan on coming in early (about 6am) tomorrow. I laughed and said, "Good luck, I'll still be sleeping."  During my lunch break, Mom and I ran all over Hell's Half Acre getting stuff for me to make low-carb Grasshopper Pie and Berry Cobbler. The cobbler will be for the house and the pie will be for class tomorrow. Tonight after dinner I still need to get some vanilla whey protein powder. I really wish we had a big organic grocery/health food store like my sister has up in Chicago. I would spend a whole lot of money there. Jeeze, I sound like such a shopaholic!

      I was glad that Hurricane Alex didn't hit southeastern North Carolina. Today was the first day of school for the county. Both the county and the college had 2-hour delays. That didn't really affect me since I don't go into work until 10 anyway.  Dad took off today and will be off tomorrow as well. He went to his appointment last night (about his swollen leg) and was told to take more of his water pill, keep his legs elevated, try to stay out of the heat, and cut out all salt or  "lite salt" . When I stopped home for lunch, his legs looked good. Well, they looked as good as they could've looked!  On my way back to work, I stopped into  GNC . This week is their Gold Card Member discount. I went in to see if they had the new  urlLink Carb Control Hydroxycut . I was shocked as hell to see it locked behind their glass cupboard. I bought a bottle to try it out. I've used regular Hydroxycut in the past with great results. I'll keep you posted on the results of the new stuff. I took my first dose here at work about 45 minutes ago. That way, when I get home for dinner, it'll be working. Speaking of dinner, tonight after dinner I have to remember to walk on the treadmill for at least 40 minutes at 3.0 mph.

      It's Monday evening and I'm waiting for tropical storm  Alex  to visit. Of course, the forecasters aren't sure if it will hit the coast or not. They also don't know if it will become a hurricane or not. Right now, it's raining like hell. A squally rain band is over Jacksonville. Mom and Dad are up at the Naval Hospital. Dad's right leg is swollen above his ankle. Mom got him an appointment at "Extended Care". Now, his appointment isn't until 9pm, yet they left at 7:30pm in hopes that he'll get seen sooner. They really do make me chuckle!  Today at lunch time, I got my haircut. I originally went to  Fantastic Sam's  before 12:30. It was standing-room only. The place with packed with Mom taking their kids for school haircuts. I left and came back at about 1:30. By then it had died down. Ronda fit me right in before I had to go back to work.  Last night while watching  Extreme Makeover: Home Edition , I walked for 2.0 miles on the treadmill.

      Well, it's just after 6:00pm, and "Alex" is off the South Carolina coast. Here is the message from the National Hurricane Center:    ... STORM INFORMATION... THE CENTER OF TROPICAL STORM ALEX IS LOCATED ABOUT 90 MILES SOUTH SOUTHEAST OF CHARLESTON SOUTH CAROLINA. ALEX HAS BEEN STATIONARY FOR MUCH OF THE DAY. A SLOW NORTH TO NORTHEAST MOTION IS EXPECTED OVER NIGHT. MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS ARE NEAR 40 MPH. SOME SLOW STRENGTHENING IS POSSIBLE DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS. ... WIND IMPACTS... WINDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE ALONG THE COAST OF NORTH CAROLINA TONIGHT... REACHING TROPICAL STORM FORCE MIDDAY MONDAY... THEN SPREADING TO THE OUTER BANKS MONDAY EVENING. THE STRONGEST WINDS WILL BE ALONG THE COAST.    Not much else is going on. Earlier today, Dad either took stuff in or tied it up so it wouldn't blow around.

      Well, this morning I weighed-in and was thoroughly disappointed to see I had gained 4.5 pounds and 1% bodyfat. When GNC opens, I'm going to get a bottle of  urlLink Hydroxycut  to help me. I've used it in the past with great results. That, in addition to my tic-tac diet, should kickstart my weight and fat loss.  I'm really  not  looking forward to having this Tropical Depression hit us. I hear that if it strengthens any before landfall, it will be called "Adam". I don't mind the rain, but I really hate the winds.
