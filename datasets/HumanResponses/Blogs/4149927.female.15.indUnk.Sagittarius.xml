       Haha.. i noticed something pretty funny- I went back and read my blog. I go from still feeling for Luke to basically tell him to fu#k off.. I like the second idea best.    I finally completely told my mama about Eric. I mentioned his name and she asked me who he was... so I asked her what she wanted to know and it went from there. I got to the age part and she goes "hmm... *eye roll*"... but then she told me that she's glad and happy for me.    I don't know if she knows how much that means to me that she approves.. I don't think I could handle being "rebelious" or whateveer you might wanna see it as. My mom is my life.. and I couldn't let her down if I tried.   I talked to Eric for maybe 10 minutes and I told him that I told my mom and her comments. I think he might've been majorly surprised that she approves of him. I don't think she'll disapprove until she has a sound reason or something to fall back on.    I know he really wants to see me and all.. and I sooo want to see him as often as I can- but I really think I have to go easy on my mom... haha. I don't want her to freak on me yet.    Just talking to Eric- I'm soo comfortable and that's really important to me. I don't know exactly how he feels about me.. but hope to find out soon. Maybe I'll get to see him on Sunday- I'm going to be with Amanda.. or Monday- b4 Amanda's party on Tuesday.    I swear some days I would make confusion confused- but It keeps me going. My g-ma's favorite quote is "Don't settle for the one you can live with... wait for the one you can't live without"... I wonder... :.. dOeS sHe HaVe A pOiNt?...:  Loadsa Love, Shana

       Okay the world will be glad to know this one... to everyone that told me to get over Luke I didn't do this for you but I did it for me. I realized after all the pain that we both put eachother through that it's not worth it.   I guess I'm just too damn proud, young and dumb to deal with him. I need someone to love me for me- that I don't have to babysit.    And I'm falling for someone. His name is Eric- and he's the gr8est, coolest, most caring guy I think i've ever met. Last nite we talked on the phone and he played guitar for me.. omg- talk about swooning to his every move. That's a sure way to get to my heart.    The one thing that I could see coming between us is our age. He's 19- there's 4 yrs and 3 days between us. Age is just a number and I have family members that have 9 or 12 yrs between them. I don't see the big deal. I'm sure my mom will approve- there's nothing not to like about him. Even if we don't make it "together" I still come out of the whole deal with the best friend.    Things change I know shit happens- but I would really want to make this work.. if he was willing to try.    For once I might actually be happy! :... yAy...:  Loadsa LOve, Shana

       Well.. today is another day. Ryan told me he read this.. hope he likes the posts about him..lol. Well I'm having boy problems again.   I really like Eric... he's totally awesome, but he's 19 (mom might freak) and supposedly i'm not supposed to go anywhere until I'm 16- so I might not get to see him very often. I'm not sure how he feels about me but I really want to know. I guess I'm just going to come straight out *like Amanda told me :) * and be like "is there ever going to be anything between us, do you want us to be together, do you think we could work, do you like me like that or what's your deal?" Hope it works!   I tried to talk to Eric about some stuff.. but he didn't really say much of anything. I'm not sure what to think now. Then Luke's talking to me and I don't want to hurt him.. so what if Eric and I don't work out is Luke going to be around again? or what if Eric and I do work (which i really hope this is the case) is Luke going to be "the friend" and support me? I'm just not sure. I told Eric and he said that me thinking about all of this and worrying about someone who doesn't care about me is a sign of immaturity. I'm not immature I'm just the type who considers EVERYONE's feelings.. Maybe that's bad?   If I didn't have my friends I don't know where I would be.. seriously. Eric's a great guy and we have mutual friends but I'm not sure what he's thinking about all this. Plus, how the fuck am I supposed to tell my mom?! I have a feeling that might not be exactly good. I'm not predicting anything though.. she might really like him. Ha! Who knows?   I guess I'm just going to have to sit back and let things happen.. if Eric comes into my life I'm DEFINITELY not going to stop it.. he's a great guy! If he doesn't and Luke comes back then okay i guess.. or if neither of those happen then there must be someone else out there. This is just messing with my mind. I know what I want I'm just scared I won't find it.   :...iT'S cOnFuSiNg...: Loadsa Love, Shana

       Last nite I went to a 50th anniversary party- that made me think- yeah I know omg... Shana thinking yeah that could've been a disaster. It made me think about how long 4ever really could be? And if I'll find "the one" and one day we'll have our 50th, 75th, 100th... ya know?   I said yesterday that I was talking to Luke- well i think he's still pretty floored (maybe) that I have feelings for him? I'm not sure what he's thinking about. He read that e-mail that I accidentally sent him when I sent it to Katherine-- all he said was "wow"... idk if that was a good wow or a bad wow.. but hmm... that last thing he said was "call me sometime" so... maybe it was good? I hope so...   One thing.. Amanda is trying to set me up with Matt.. I like him a lot. Then there's Eric- and the other 10 guys that have asked me out... I don't wanna hurt anyone. Eric told me that he just wants me to be happy... well I want that too.. but Idk where to find it. I'm not sure if I fix things with Luke if they'll ever really be fixed becuz the trust and everything has been damaged soo many times for too damn long. I'm just not sure. If Luke and I do get back together- then gr8 by me but ppl are starting to think that both of us are just plain "pathetic".. i don't care what they think if we really love eachother but I don't want it to be just so he and i are together.. ya know?   I know things will be a lot ezier once I turn 16- then I'm allowed to be with whoever i want to be with.. but right now I still have ... what?... 2 friggin months.. yahoo!. I don't understand why mom has to go to the exact day but then again why question her madness.. she is my mother.   I'm soo scared that I'll mess up in life and then things won't turn out like I have planned. I don't want anything to interferre with my "plans".. i want my dreams and me to come first.. then if someone fits in there- well hey i'm not stopping it but i don't wanna be controlled... what's going to happen.   I think I have all these thoughts becuz of "my mom" and how she didn't get to live her life to the fullest.. was it her fault or was it planned that way? I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do? I'm not sure why I'm living this life? What's my purpose? Thinking about all of this... well :...iT jUsT hUrTs...:     Love, Shana

       Sorry.. it's been a while since I've written- but you all will live. A lot has happened believe it or not.. remember "everything happens to Shana"    Well the other nite Jamie, Amanda, Jolene and I went to the fair it was lots of fun but Eric was supposed to come and he stood me up. Yeah well he told me that he was sick- I guess if that's the case then I'll 4give him.    Luke was there- he didn't say more than two words to me.. so I know that we are defintely over. I guess it's a big loss for both of us.. I don't know- that's how I feel anyway. I don't know if it's worth it.    Amanda is trying to hook me and Matt up- well we both like eachother and he's totally perfect.. but I don't get it why all these guys want me? If that were the case you'd think that Luke would want to get me back a.s.a.p. but i don't think that's the case. I guess I have to move on becuz that's what he's telling me to do. Hopefully someday someone will pull me aside and be like "shana, this is why i like you" I wish.... I still Love Luke but I can't wait 4ever.   I haven't talked to Ryan since I said last.   It's been 8 yrs since my dad died now... i can't believe he's actually gone.   OMG- Luke is talking to me online.. go figure.. I halfta go.. ttyl

       So... Another day huh? Some friends come into our lives and quickly go, Others stay for a while and leave foot prints in our hearts that last forever..... A Life with Love will have some thorns but a Life without Love will have no roses. That makes perfect sense to me... so why can't i understand it?!?   Yesterday I called Luke... i can tell he's still really mad @ me. He doesn't talk to me like he used to... now he's the one with the reserves. I completely understand why... i think? but it's just really hard. I think deep down the only reason he talks to me @ all is becuz he doesn't want to lose me.. He even told me that once. I don't know if he still feels that way but I hope so. He also told me that I will have as MANY chances as I need so we can get it right, does he still mean it?! I don't know how to fix things and I want to SO bad... But I don't want to push it either- that could make things worse... ya think?   I'm just lucky I have such gr8 friends... they keep me going. Starting with .....   :...@M@ND@...: She's totally my everything. Our lives are parallel. It's so crazy- the first time I met her my immediate thought was that we would NEVER be friends.. haha- oops! Now we're inseparable.. And I wouldn't have it any other way. It seems like everything happens to us @ the same time. We both fall in love- we both break up- we both think everyone hates us- and we both think we're nothing that anyone should do flips for. I'm SO happy that I have her. If I were to die tomorrow I would owe her everything.. She hasn't let me down yet. Plus, she introduces me to some pretty gr8 ppl ( ie: Donny ;)...lmao) She's one of the best ppl to be around- we always laugh when we're around one another. It's the best times. A lot of ppl that don't know her judge her by the way she looks or acts (I did it too :S ) but Manda is one of those ppl that if you don't get inside of her head you'd never understand.. I for one have gotten really close to her.. we tell eachother everything even things we don't wanna know. She's my soul sister.     :...@LlI$$oN...: We didn't get to be really close until the end of the year. We always talked- especially in band. I pretty much tried to help her as much as I could with the harder music and I hope I did. But then we started talking about life... we got to know eachother pretty well. She's always smiling and it's pretty much infectious. I love the way she can walk into a room and make everything better- I hope i'm like that too. We always give eachother advice and our latest project is trying to get a dance team going @ school. We WILL do it- there's no doubt about that. I think Allison has a tendency to keep a lot inside- I wish she would open up more but I'm not going to pry her into anything. She's perfect the way she is and I wouldn't change anything- I'm so glad I can call her my friend.     :...j@MiE...: Starting @ day one... Everyone thought I was her... Even her twin sister. We don't see it.. but they obviously did. We're very similar in SO many ways and we love to steal eachothers clothes. Someday I have a feeling she'll come over and take 'em all...lol. Nah- she's not that mean..;) She's gr8 to be around- she's always trying to do what she can for everyone. That's where I see a lot of myself in her. She's Luke's best friend... go figure, right? I think it's kinda hard for her to balance us when we are fighting. Jamie and I do a lot of the same things.. Forensics, drama club, etc. , etc. It's really awesome to have someone I can share everything with (including my clothes..lmao) I don't mind she always returns them..:) She has some really good advice to... she knows how to word things to leave holes so everyone is happy. She does have her moments, like the rest of us and that basically makes her human- I love it. We've had SO many good times and I know there's more to come.      Those are prolly my BEST friends... hmmm- anyone notice Ryan's not on that list?.. lemme explain.   :...rY@N...: Ryan is one of my best friends- I tell him almost everything. But I noticed that he doesn't like a lot of the things I choose in life. One being- Luke. I don't think he has any idea how much it rips me apart for my so-called best friend to HATE my b/f. It's like he doesn't even support the fact that I wanna make it work. He always tells me "You deserve better"... well to him better is... him. I love Ryan.. he's fun to be with. BUT i could never be "with" him. There's no way around it.. we're not meant to be like that. We used to joke around about getting married... it was just that a joke. I know he likes me more than a friend and it's hard for me to balance the friend side and the love side. I don't understand why he would like me more than a friend. I don't even understand what Luke or any of the guys that like me sees. I don't see what I have to offer that some other girl doesn't. :S . Ryan's never had a g/f... I know there's a perfect girlie out there for him.. but it's not me. I know it.. it's not. I don't feel it- I don't know if I can feel it. He doesn't like Luke becuz of "the things he does, says and how he treats me" well... I really like to know how Luke treats me in his mind. Luke has pulled some shady things and it's not like I haven't. Ryan's just a little prejudice- he'd choose me over anyone. He loves hanging out with me when Luke's around just to try and prove that he has higher status I think. I love Ryan's family and his mom is soo gr8. But I could be the same with Luke's family in a heartbeat- I just haven't had my opportunity to do so. I can't keep calling him my best friend if he's just going to shoot down my dreams. It doesn't work like that. Luke is my ultimate.. he's everything I've ever looked for and more.. and I will NOT lose him becuz of Ryan- but I fear that I already have! If I have to choose one over the other I'm going to have to, right?     :...lUkE...: I could never apologize enough to him. But I'll sure as hell try. No one will stop me from trying. I think I hurt him in ways that even I don't know about. That I REALLY don't know how to fix... he doesn't talk to me about it. I've put a lot of ppl in the middle of us, and I can't even understand why I did that. It's like I was trying to protect myself from being with him? We've never really been "alone"... becuz I haven't let him be alone with me. It's like I'm expecting him to be something he could never be and I know he would never be. I can't deal with not being with him... but sometimes it's hard for me to BE with him. I know why... becuz I do put distance between us. That relationship with "N" has dramatically changed my life for the worse. I can't even begin to repair the hurt he caused me. I need help doing it... and it's not that Luke didn't help me- it's more like I never gave him the time of day to help. My mom won't let me go anywhere with him until I'm officially "16" that I don't understand. I've never done anything to lose her trust- I have good grades- never been in trouble- sure I'm not perfect but can I get any closer to it as far as she knows? Nothing is going to change now to then.. but right now I don't have to worry about it. Luke isn't around... I wonder if he does have feelings for me still or if he just completely erased them all. I want to be with him but he's mad....   :..iS tHis hOw iT hAs tO bE?...: lOadsa lOve, Shana

       Hey- if you're reading this you MUST be one of my friends. I'm starting this so my friends can basically read up on what's going on in my life. No, not like a journal- just about things that go on. Starting Now....    :... lUkE ...:  Maybe you know what's been going on with us. We've been on and off for about a year now. I love him so much- but I seem to f**k it up more than I fix it. I've never had a problem showing how much I love someone~ Until I met Luke. The first time I ever saw him- it was the first day of school, in gym class. I didn't know anyone I was "THE NEW GIRL"... i saw him playing basketball and something just made me stop and glance again. I wasn't sure what it was @ first.     He has a smile that could make any one melt. Not only his smile but his eyes got me. I think since he met me I've pretty much confused him beyond recognition- I'm so not proud of that. Both of us have broken the trust but I have more. Right now, we're not together but I would do anything to change that. We are talking but it's not the same, and I have a feeling it might not be- ever- but I don't care... I don't want it to be the same.     I have a problem with giving what I don't get. There's only ONE PROBLEM- Luke gave me everything and still I could give. I know I'm not selfish I'm just scared. If you're my friend you know that I've had bad experiences in the past- and I can't believe I let that or those... get in the way. I can't take it back and I know you're not supposed to have any regrets in life... but this is definitely one of them.   I love him and everything about him and his family and I could go on and on and on.... BUT i wonder if it's fair to him that I have reserves. I tell him almost everything but he still feels like I don't. I don't know how to change that. Is there something I could do?    The reason we broke up last time- was becuz things were said that I never meant to say. Nor did I intend to say. It has a lot to do with my friend Ryan.. I used to call him my best friend- but I realized that he doesn't want me with Luke.. so when we broke up he thought he could move in. A BEST friend wouldn't do that.. nor would a best friend tell me that I shouldn't be with the only man I've ever loved like this. That's Luke.. it's not fair to me or Luke. He' s not a best friend. We broke up becuz Rumors say that we're more than friends. If only I woulda told Luke how I really felt about Ryan... maybe I will do that when things calm down. I love Ryan- as in the friend sorta way- NOTHING MORE--EVER!    I'm not going to push us to get back together if it's meant to be it'll happen, right? It seems like just when things get good they're done. I was just getting out of my "stand-offish" mode.. and then I was thrown back into it again. That's not cool! It's like thing ended before they started. I hope one day he could read this... I love him soo much. But if we can't be what I want us to be @least I come out with the best experience of my life so far. I have so many dreams for my future and they fit PERFECTLY with his. It seems meant to be to me.    All I could even think about saying to him right now is   I'M SOOOO SORRY!    if he doesn't think I'm sincere then I'll find a way to prove it. I don't give up.. I won't.. I can't. My heart is telling me to go get what I want. His name is Luke.. if you don't know him you should. You'd love him too. He makes my life better. I've never been so happy- I just don't know how to show that I'm happy.      If he comes back into my life I have to show him. Things will be sooo much easier after I turn 16! Then I'm actually allowed to love him..lol. You know how the parental units get. I want to be with him. He's perfect- but everytime I realize that. That's  :..wHen tHings cOme cRashing dOwn...:  lOadsa lOve, Shana-Marie
