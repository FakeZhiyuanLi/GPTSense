       Well having had quite a hectic week I will finally settle down for some much needed vacation time. My family and I are flying down to  Cabo San Lucas  for 10 days which should be nice. I just read online that it only rains 5 days out of the year there. Imagine  that!  Being a man of bad timing that I am, of course I  had  to plan it just as principal animation starts on our pilot  The Jackalope Boyz  but sometimes you just have to go and leave it all behind. While there I do intend to spend a bit of time doing illustrations for the next  Ribeye  book,  The Sands of Fate  so when you see those drawings you'll know that they were done in good ol' Mexico.   I intend to take a few of the original Ribeye books  Ribeye the Bullbarian and the Jewel of Baloni  and just leave them in some cafes . Hopefully someone will pick one up and read it!  Little Trivia:   Did you know that when the Spaniards came over to Mexico that the country was originally called  Mehico  and the Spaniards for whatever reason changed it all "h" to "X" and that's why even todfay all Mexicans refer to their country as Mehico. True story...  I will try to post some stuff while I'm down there but if I can't you can be sure Harry will be updating regularly. Oh yeah and watch for a nice surpise coming on our website on the 4th of July! This is Milo saying over AND out!  Peace!

       One of the coolest things about working at a big studio like Warner Bros. is the celebrities that come through doing voice-over work and promos. Recently I have seen, Casey Kasem (Radio personality), Michael Clark Duncan (The Green Mile, Scorpion King), Ron Perlman (Hellboy), That blonde girl from The Bachelor that just recently won and Peter McNichol ( Ally McBeal, Ghostbusters II).  Who else, let's see, over the years I've met Steven Spielberg walking around the studio, Ted Turner, Joe Barbera, Bill Hanna, Bruce Timm, Alec Baldwin, Chuck Jones, and a ton of others I can't think of at the moment. It's really nice as well that the studio can pull in that caliber of actor for it's shows.  Warner's is a great place to work actually and while they definately look to cut corners where they can ( who doesn't) they seem to really have their act together unlike Disney's which I ehar is a complete mess. My crew on Xiaolin Showdown is known as the party crew and every Thursday we trun one of the reception areas into The Showdown Bar complete with mixed drink, TV, music and bar stools.   Apparently it's gotten around L.A. as well as people from other shows have started coming over to hang out with us as well. You know you work at an excellent studio when you can turn it into an after hours bar!

           It's cool coming across old artwork. Mike and I have been working on projects together since 1986, and we're always finding old stuff one of us did years ago.   This image I find particularly cool: It's from a birthday card Mike Milo made for his mother in 1993. It features all of our own characters from that period (including Ribeye and Cubesteak, seen in the center with Charlie Hippo), as well as characters from studios Mike worked at up to that point: WB's "Tiny Toons", "Tazmania", "Animaniacs" etc.- Film Roman's "The Simpsons" and "The Critic" and the Honey Nut Cherrios bee which Mike animated in several commercials.

       Well, my wife is off on a tour of her native country Estonia for the next few weeks. She's part of an Estonian theatre troupe, and they are doing a tour of Estonia and Latvia. She has a big performance at a festival in Riga, Latvia coming up.  Gee, it sure is quiet around here without her! I'm speculating that means I'll be able to buckle down and get a lot of writing done, but I've also got to be twice as vigilant in resisting the procrastination bug.  Technology never ceases to amaze me. It keeps us together, even when we're around the world from each other. We've been able to keep in touch via video-cam on the internet. It's a far cry better than the telephone as it offers picture and sound, and it's certainly cheaper. I was able to see and talk to her earlier this week while she was staying with her sister in Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia. I also got to see our little niece who is 4, and our newborn nephew! And of course my wife and I have been keeping in touch via plain old fashioned IM's and e-mails.   Also my wife has been doing a blog of her own. In fact, helping her set hers up is what inspired me to start one myself. She's been documenting her trip with blog entries whenever she can get online. Now if she could just find a way to upload some images!   This coming week, with no distractions pending, I'm going into virtual seclusion so I can hammer out the final writing chores on the second Ribeye book. Procrastination shall not triumph!

       Today I was having lunch with Mike over at WB Animation in Sherman Oaks, and we were walking down Ventura Blvd. when out from the back of a limousine steps animation legend Joe Barbera and his assistants on their way to lunch. Joe is an animation legend. He and William Hanna created the famous Tom and Jerry cartoons for MGM in the 40's through the late 50's when the rise of television killed the theatrical cartoon.   Rather than cave-in to the 'threat' TV posed on animation, Hanna and Barbera pioneered their own special brand of limited animation that made it affordable to create original animation for television. Their studio (which I'm proud to have worked at for several years back in the 1990's) created the first prime-time animated shows like the Flintstones and the Jetsons, as well as most of the Saturday morning fare many of us grew up watching. (Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, Scooby-Doo, Johnny Quest and the list goes on...)  Sadly Bill Hanna passed away in 2001 and is greatly missed by his fans.   Joe Barbera is in his 90's and he's still out and about. It was an honor to shake hands with such an animation icon. Mike and I both had the honor of meeting him previously during our H&B days a decade ago. I own an autographed copy of his autobiography: "My Life in 'Toons: From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century" and several autographed cells from H&B grace the walls in my home.  My hats off to a man who was key in making the industry I've made my living in -Television Animation- a viable reality!

       Now that the recording for the Jackalopes film is done, our next step will be to make what is called an Animatic. In the 30's and 40's it was referred to as a Leica reel. By either name, it's basically the storyboard scanned into the computer and edited together with all of the dialog to form a sort of slide show; complete with sound. This step is where we really start to see the film come together and it helps us find out if it's on time or too long. It also helps us read which jokes work and which ones don't. During the recording we had the actors ad-lib in places and in some cases recorded multiple lines for jokes so we could see which ones were the funniest. An animatic is an extremely useful tool when used correctly.   It's also a great tool for people who can't really "read" a storboard well and need to see it move in front of them. A lot of executives like to use animatics so they can really see the flow of a film without having to work to hard.  Harry would know best about that after a six years stint as an Assistant director over at Klasky Csupo who made such hits as Rugrats, As told by Ginger,The Wild Thornberries and a host of other faves for Nickelodeon before Paramount pulled the rug out from under them.

       The recording session for the Jackalope Boyz went fantastic. We arrived at Salami Studios in North Hollywood at 9am Tuessday morning, (June 22nd), joined by the WB Cartoon Monsoon development staff, as well as the record crew, and of course the incredible voice talent.   First to record were veteran voice actors  urlLink Carlos Alazraqui  and  urlLink Joe Alaskey.   Just check out the long and varied credits of either of these two (by clicking their links above) to see the amazingly high caliber of talent we were fortunate enough to work with! Virtually everyone has to have heard some of the characters these guys have voiced over the years, and chances are great there are a few of your favorites on the list.    Mike Milo watches the record from the control room at Salami Studios.   It was a treat to hear these guys provide the voices for our main characters and supporting cast. We went through the storyboard and witnessed the actors in the booth give life to our animated vision. Both Joe and Carlos had us cracking up as they acted out their assigned character's lines. They both acted several characters. Carlos did an amazing Manuel (The Jackalope Boy wearing the hat- see the model sheets in the previous posts) and Joe turned in a slide-splitting performance as their overbearing boss, along with other roles.    That's me, Harry McLaughlin. No, I'm not asleep, just keeping a tab on the record script as the session progresses.   Around 11am another veteran voice talent arrived:  urlLink Candi Milo . (No relation to Mike, just co-inky-dink!) Her career and list of credits is as long and varied as the others'.  Candi did several of the female voices, as well as the male child voices of 'baby prodigy' Arriba (the middle Jackalope), and Jaime (the tall Jackalope).     Mike smiles, not for the camera, but because Joe Alaskey was cracking him up.    It was a blast seeing all these talented folks do their thing, and a total trip realizing that they were bringing to life the characters that Mike and I created! It's really amazing to watch someone act out the lines that you have written, and bring life to characters you've dreamed up. All around, a truly awesome experience as it always is!

         When I'm not writing, or working on a cartoon with Mike, these days you're likely to find me plugging away on website development work. I really love doing web design and learning new things. For example, figuring out how to make this blog work, and integrate nicely into my site was a lot of fun.  I'm the the 'webmaster' of a site called  urlLink HI-POD.com  as well as this one. (Heh, I like the title 'web-master'; it sounds akin to 'Kung-Fu master' or something.) The HI-POD company is run by a good friend of mine named Enrique. We worked together for five years at the animation studio Klasky Csupo.   A HI-POD is a high-end camera monopod that can elevate a video or still camera to a 15 foot elevation, and allow a single camera person to shoot and monitor the signal at eye-level. The unit is fully controllable, and portable; there's nothing else than can do the same task without an unwieldy multi-person crane or jib setup. And you can't begin to get those into the same small spaces the HI-POD can fit into.  I think the HI-POD's origin story is remarkable. Enrique originally started a sporting event taping company. His idea was a fleet of mobile-studio vans that could cover smaller local games that media wouldn't normally document. He needed to quickly get multiple cameras covering the field, and feeding back to the mobile van- the same set up as the big guys use, but with every element scaled down to it's most compact possible form. In the course of developing a compact and portable field camera platform for game coverage, Enrique invented the HI-POD.   The idea was so good and the HI-POD was such a success, that he eventually dropped the original sports taping company and made manufacturing the HI-POD his core business.  It just serves to remind me that many times great ideas are born wholly unexpected out of the rubble of cast-aside dreams. It's a fascinating part of the creative process. You just never know when you start a creative endeavor, exactly what will emerge in the end.  That's what I like about writing books and creating animated films. I know that I'm in for a wild and crazy journey from start to finish. I love knowing that along the way, new and unique ideas and concepts will be born out of the fury of creative shuffle. It's just one of the many things I love about the creative process.

       It's true, I'm addicted to freelance. No I really am because no normal man would subject himself to the things I do just to get a little extra cash. I was up until 2 am this morning doing freelance sheet timing and the bags are big under my eyes today. I called a friend of mine on the new Cartoon Network show Krypto the Dog Wonder and he gave me 200 feet of footage to time out. Sheet Timing is a process whereby they have big sheets of paper that account for every frame of film and the timer's job is to mark out each and every action ALL the characters do in the entire film, including background pans and camera moves. Doing exposure sheets is a tedious job and it has made me a tired man.  It's actually been a tough week as all my Aunt was visiting from Joisey last week and at the same time I had to reboard over 15 pages of lost storyboard for our short The Jackalope Boyz. Don't ask how it happened because I can't really answer you. It's somewhere in Cartoon Heaven I guess.   To make matters even more difficult, as a Director on Xiaolin Showdown we are also expected to storyboard half an act of our show which amounts to about 5-6 pages of script. That PLUS directing can be very tiresome and difficult... At least for me. I'm an "okay" storyboard artist but I wouldn't count myself in the top ten or anything and sometimes it's difficult to make my deadlines. So far I've done it but each episode it gets harder. To top all these goings on, like an idiot I went ahead and found some freelance to do when I didn't really have the time to do it.   On top of that we had a lil' hiccup on Friday when we got 7 pages of notes from the Development team for Jackalopes just before we were to record. Stressed me out to be sure! Add to all that some EXTRA work, and as you can see I am addicted to freelance.   My mom used to say that I liked to have "5 plates in the air at all times"... I guess she was right. Tonight I will once again burn the lamp at both ends to finish the sheets for Krypto and get back to work to finish my section of storyboards for Xiaolin Showdown. Now if I can just figure out how to squeeze in the drawings for the new Ribeye book...

       During the process of designing the characters we went through many different instances of design. Initially The Jackalope Boyz started as The Iguana Boyz but the dev. execs wanted us to change that due to a conflict with another Monsoon short. Below is the original design and the subsequent designs that led up to the final one. This is the original designs      We liked the designs but they had to change so...first we tried monkeys...      Then we refined on that idea...      Then we tried parrots...           Then we hit on the idea of making then into jackalopes! Building on that we started from scratch and this is what first came out...       Then we got some notes from the execs and we refined it a bit...      and ultimately we tweeked and tweeked until we ended with the final result which is what you will see when the film premieres!

         Another intersting thing to mention is our short The Jackalope Boyz which records at Salami Studios in North Hollywood tomorrow. We've got a nice lineup of characters for the case.   urlLink Cartoon Monsoon  is a very interesting site that's owned by Warner Bros. and has dedicated itself to create new and invigorating cartoons for the web. Some of the stuff that's been done from last season is specatacular for a flash cartoon and pretty amazing when you think about that you are downloading a real live cartoon over a tiny wire in the back of your computer. We've come a long way in my book!   The voices for our short so far are as follows... Candy Milo - Dexter on 'Dexter's Laboratory, the Flea on 'Mucha' and Astroboy on 'Astroboy' Carlos Alazraqui - Rikochet on 'Mucha,' and the voice of the Chihuahua on those old Taco Bell ads Joe Alaskey - Bugs, Daffy, Sylvester, etc..... In a different type of casting we will pick the voices from each right there at the record depending on who can do what. Should be interesting though!

       Here it is! The cover of the second Ribeye the Bullbarian Adventure:   _______________________________________________________________________  The cover began life as a rough layout that I drew. My original idea looked like this. At first we weren't quite settled on the villain. Here the deadly 'sands of fate' are looming over our heroes, but the exact nature of the threat was just a little too ambiguous:    _______________________________________________________________________  Mike Milo did a more polished layout that more closely resembles the finished cover art:   _______________________________________________________________________  Finally, Mike penciled and inked the finished line art. I worked out the background image, and placed the final elements together. Then I colored the characters for the final cover.   _______________________________________________________________________

       I miss the days of drawing comics. Mike and I created quite a few comics back in the day. Perhaps one of these days we'll have to seriously consider doing more of them.   Usually we'd start with a layout. That's how I like to write and rough out the details of a comic book story; in layout form. The layout isn't meant to look great, I don't really try to put the characters on model, or polish it at all. It's just to get a basic overview of the story. Here's the layout from a Charlie Hippo comic book from the early 1990's:     Mike takes the layouts, blows them up to the size of a standard comic page and pencils the artwork. Along the way, he refines the character poses and cleans up problems with the layout. The pencils are then inked and lettered to produce the finished page:     Ahh well, so much for comic nostalgia. I'm currently knee-deep in writing chores for our new book, but enjoying every minute. Back into seclusion I go!

           I love how ideas often take on a life of their own. Often, you lose track of them before finding them again years later, whereupon they take on another form. Mike and I had an idea called the Bunny Brothers many years ago. It was to be a show about two brothers who were always cooking up odd schemes. The idea never really went anywhere, but we did actually use them in a comic book published by an independent press called Robot Publishing in 1996. It was for a comic book called (of all things!) "Hot Mexican Love". The comic was a collaboration, containing stories by a host of animation artists, most of them my colleagues at Klasky Csupo.   Here's a portion of the comic, penciled by Mike, and inked and lettered by me:      The comic was obviously for adults, and an odd 'Mexico' theme. (Incidentally where Mike is now, in  Cabo San Lucas ! Though I doubt his vacation trip there with his family is anything like the blatant debauchery that the Bunny Brothers got up to on their trip south of the border!)  The Bunny Bros. was an idea that sat dormant for years, and except for that one rare and forgotten comic appearance, seemed destined to be one of our ideas that we'd never revisit.   However, when we were looking for a project to pitch to Warner Brothers recently, we revisited the Bunny Bros. By the time we finished re-developing the core of the idea that was never very developed, the rabbits had become Jackalopes, and there were three of them rather than two.   The bunnies evolved into the 'Iguana Boyz'. That idea we kicked around for a few years before they evolved into to Jackalopes. You can see the evolution in picture form in Mike's post  urlLink Jacks Designs.

       More illustration layouts for the new book finished today. Mike is cranking out the finished drawings like wildfire. I'm resisting the urge to post new illustrations on here (you'll just have to wait for the book!) but there's just some really nice new stuff. I'm currently laying out the illustrations for the final chapter.     Ribeye re-united with his kid brother Cubesteak after a harrowing separation.   Since there's a lot of emphasis on illustrating our work, I've had people ask me: "Are the Ribeye adventures picture books"? The answer is no. These are full novels for kids and young adults (and the not-so-young type as well) just that we love to cram them full of illustrations. Though of course any novel uses the reader's imagination as the primary stage, I believe it's also rewarding for the reader to see what some of the crazy cast of characters, outrageous situations, and exotic locales actually look like.  Specifically, I love books that have a nice balance of story and illustration, where the illustration doesn't give the story away, rather keeps you wondering. I turn the page and see the illustration and think, "Wow! I wonder what that's all about? Let me keep reading and find out!"   When I was a kid, I loved books by author William Steig. He always managed to strike that perfect blend of illustrating his stories in a way that made me want to know more, without ever giving anything away. I recently dusted off and re-read his book  urlLink 'Dominic'  which was a childhood favorite.   Another book I've been inspired by recently is Tor Seidler's  urlLink "A Rat's Tale" , with illustrations by Fred Marcellino. The book is just beautifully done. The story is fantastic, and the stunning illustrations compliment the story perfectly.  Great works by others inspire me greatly, and make me aspire to get better and better at what I do. I can only hope to be half as capable as most of the great writers and illustrators out there. Right now, I'm going to get back to the writing grind, and keep striving for better!

       Whoosh, what a week it's been. I've been pedal to the metal in my writing chores, and I've gotten a huge amount of work completed. The final draft of "Ribeye the Bullbarian and the Sands of Fate" is in great shape.  It can finally be told; the next Ribeye book after this I've already outlined. It will be called "Ribeye the Bullbarian Beyond the Great Wall of Chow Mein." More on that later.  Mike is back from Mexico. While he was there, between saving people's lives (it happened!) and relaxing with his family, he managed to do a lot of the drawings for the new Ribeye book. Today I finally got to see them, and let me tell you, this book is going to look fantastic! Mike's outdone himself! All the new characters that are introduced look great, and the new illustrations are top notch. A writer simply can't have it any better, than to have an artist as talented as Mike to work worth!  I'm also plugging away on the layout drawings for the new book. As with comics, I usually draw a rough layout first, and from that Mike does the finished drawing. That's a pattern that has always worked out well for us.  I'm exhausted from days of seemingly non-stop work, but I love it when my creative energies are as focused as they are lately. Leila will finally be back on Sunday, and it won't be soon enough! I've really missed her! Now to get the house cleaned up before she gets back! Nah, it's really not so bad, but I know she's convinced I've wrecked the place having been left up to my own devices for so long.   Well... now that I look around, my writing desk is indeed a jumbled clutter!

       An amazingly talented 3D modeler and animator named Trentity DeWitt is working on 3D models of Ribeye and the cast of characters from our Ribeye books. Mike and I are hoping to eventually make animated 3D cartoons of Ribeye and his Bullbarian Age world.  3D modeling is an extremely complicated process that takes many years to master. Drawing well in 2D is difficult enough, but the thought process behind creating characters that work in full three dimensional form is another whole level of skill altogether.  Ribeye is built by the modeler based on hand-drawn animation model sheets done by Mike. It's hard enough 'sculpting' an accurate 3D version of a 2D character like Ribeye- just getting him to look right on the 'outside' is only half the task!     Beneath the outward appearance of the character, is an inner structure that's incredibly complicated. There are actually 'bones' that control the character's limbs and motion. Beyond that, there are controls that the animator uses to manipulate the character's features, allowing him to talk, blink his eyes, and make facial expressions. All of these inner workings operate based on a given range of computer-coded control that is set up by a skilled 3D modeler.   Creating this internal structure called 'rigging' is an extremely difficult skill to master; it requires a lot of very precise calculation, and knowledge of how to create anatomy that simulates the actual laws of physics. For example- in reality a person cannot twist their leg 180 degrees backward, nor have their arm disappear inside their torso. A 3D model by contrast, can easily break any rule of physics if not given a set of programmed restraints that mimic the real world. Unrestrained, the contortions a character goes through when moved look ridiculous on screen.   When an animator poses the character -like a digital puppet- the inner anatomy as 'rigged' by a good modeler, makes the character move and behave in a way that gives the illusion of true volume, weight and gravity.  It's a fascinating process! I had to the good fortune last year to work on a 3D animated feature film, using the application 3D Max. It was an experience that's hooked me on wanting to do more 3D animation.

       It's the 4th of July! Time to eat a little too much, hang out with friends and family, watch fireworks, and write books...  Well... as for my agenda, one out of four ain't bad!  There will be none of the usual 4th festivities for me this year... but I will be doing quite a bit of writing today. I'm pleased that the finishing stages of 'Ribeye and the Sands of Fate' are coming along very nicely. All-in-all, I like how things are shaping up with this new book.  I talked to my wife the other day via internet video/phone. (Technology rocks!) She's having a great time in Estonia, but I think she's getting tired of all the travel. She'll be back home next week. I'll sure be happy when she's back, even though I've enjoyed this time to work on my things without interruption.  Thats it from my neck of the woods! Time to shackle myself to the desk again, and get back to my writing.  Happy 4th to all!

       As Harry said, I've been making these dolls since the early 70's and it's always been a source of great enjoyment for me. My mom got me started doing them and it was she who coined the phrase "Bendanimals". I would always bug her to get me the new GI JOE with the Kung Fu grip and eventually she got tired of buying me new ones so she told me to go make one myself and that's just what I did. My first one was a werewolf when I was about eleven and man I played that thing into the ground as you can clearly see by it's ratty state.&nbsp;           The first Bendanimal, the Werewolf, made in the 1970's.      My brother Andy used to chew the feet and eventually they fell off but I kept the thing anyway. What's now ironic about the werewolf (I still have it) is that the hair on his head came off and so just like his creator he is now balding! :-)    I stopped making the Bendanimals for a while and started them up again when I made a Charlie Hippo one around 1989. This one was much beefier and I understood much better how to make the characters and work with the clay and plastic. Unfortunately a week later I was showing it to my girlfriend's friend (who I hated BTW) and she said "EH, I guess that's cool, does it bend?" She bent the leg and it fell off! I was crestfallen because, to me, it was a piece of art and she had just destroyed it.&nbsp;

         Mike Milo is not only a great 2D illustrator and animator; he's also an accomplished 3D artist as well. Not&nbsp;just 3D in the computer sense, but character sculpting as well.             Our character Charlie Hippo as a Bendanimal made by Mike in 1993        Since he was a kid, Mike has made these really cool sculpted cartoon action figures he's dubbed 'Bendanimals'. The name is derived from an internal wire armature that allows these sculptures to freely bend, so they can be posed. Only the heads, hands, feet and various accessories are made or rigid clay and plastic- much of the body is a plush mesh of gauze and pillow stuffing.  &nbsp;  Mike has a whole collection of these creations dating back to the first one he made as a teenager in the early 1970's! It's a sculpture of a Werewolf, and he still has it!&nbsp;                 Bendanimals of Luke and Lester, from a project we sold to Universal Cartoons called 'Cool Patrol'.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;      Since he can describe the actual process, I asked Mike to give us the low-down on exactly how he creates a Bendanimal:&nbsp;  &nbsp;        "The Bendanimals are made of armature wire wrapped with gauze and blanket batting, which is what they use to stuff comforters and pillows. I then dyed the fur and sewed it on each character.  &nbsp;  The fingers, feet and heads of the characters are made of Sculpy (a baking clay) and then painted to match the fur color. The horns are made of a product called Friendly Plastic."    &nbsp;

       I've definitely got the bug to start drawing comics again. Just today over lunch, Mike and I were discussing the possibility of doing a Ribeye the Bullbarian comic book. We're both psyched to attempt it! Ironically, we started laying out a Ribeye comic back in 1993, we just never finished it.   I started wanting to draw comic books long before I ever learned how to draw! It's a kick to go back and look at my early efforts. I drew comics from my earliest days, the first dating back to 1977 when I was 9 years old. I still have many of my early comics- my mother has the whole collection.   One of the things that clicked between Mike and I when we met in art school, was the fact that we both had a desire to draw our own comics and write our own music from an early age.   I loved super-hero comics a lot, and wrote and drew adventures to amuse myself and the small readership of classmates and friends I had. Back in the days before affordable PC home-printing, I used to use the library photo-copier as my main 'printing press', and later the presses in my school's communications classes. I was a budding 'publisher' from an early age.        Various issues of 'The Raiders'    One of my favorite series was the adventures of a super-hero group called 'The Raiders'. I drew 72 issues of this comic from September 1982 to July 1986 at the rate of several 16- page issues per week. I used to sell copies for 10, 12 or 15 cents, imitating the price structure of silver age comics that I was a big fan of. I usually drew most of the issues, but many of them were written by my friends, most notably James Fitzgerald who plotted about half of the stories. My next door neighbor and childhood buddy Steven Brown wrote and drew quite a number of comics himself, including a few Raiders adventures.        A stack of Speed Demon issues    My favorite super-hero was the Raiders' leader, a character named Speed Demon. He was popular enough with my tiny readership to spin off his own series of 24 issues. Speed Demon was something of a high-speed acrobat who got by without any real super powers, other than generally being too speedy for his foes to hit. His worst enemy was a sinister criminal syndicate known as C.L.A.W. which was rumored to stand for Criminal Legislative Authority Worldwide, though it was never officially confirmed. C.L.A.W. was always gunning for S.D. and they cropped up every few issues with some new sinister plot.        Sound Wave #1 from May 1986    Another character I really liked drawing was one called 'Sound Wave'. He was a teenage kid who suffered a freak accident while experimenting with a 'hyper-sonic' Hi-Fi stereo system in the garage of his best friend and inventive genius, Arnold. The incident left him with the ability to wield hyper-sonic sound as a weapon. But rather than take on the big time bad guys of the world, I wrote the character with the limitations of a teen stuck in a small city. He was the only 'super-hero' who had to bum rides off his parents to get to a battle, and who had to finish up before dinner time. His foes were mostly the local petty criminals and gang-bangers. Only his friend Arnold shared in his super-secret- and the two of them couldn't wait for Arnold to get his driver's license. All the while Sound Wave aspired to be a 'real' super hero someday, and maybe join The Raiders.        A Rack story from Zap Funnies #23, May 1985    I drew a lot of funny comics also. A favorite of mine was a character called 'Rack'. Rack was a suburban raccoon, and 'Pup-Scout' leader struggling to be a good role model for his young son Rackiddy. Unfortunately, most any lesson he tried to teach his son or the Pup Scout troop, backfired on him with disastrous results.   Ahh well, enough reminiscing, back to writing! By the way, I picked up a bunch more of the new drawings for the Ribeye book from Mike today- they all look GREAT!

       I've been interested in book-binding since I was a small kid. I experimented constantly with making my own hardbound and paperback books.      Hand-printed proof copies of my book "Ribeye the Bullbarian and the Jewel of Baloni"   As a writer, I've found that what I've learned over time about do-it-yourself binding has really come in handy. For example, I love to make perfect-bound, trade paperback-sized proof copies of my books at every draft stage.  The benefits for a writer are enormous. First and foremost, you can hand a good-looking perfect-bound copy of your latest manuscripts to your friends/family/co-authors/illustrators/ - anyone whose opinion you'd like, or who is a part of the creative process with you. You stand a far greater chance of them reading a perfect-bound book (and therefore giving you in-depth feedback) than you will just handing them a cumbersome stack of manuscript pages. People may not always tell you, but most folks don't like reading lengthy tomes in other than a book form they're used to.  For myself, I find a proof makes editing and re-writing far easier. I don't know what it is, but reading through your work in actual book form makes mistakes and needed changes just leap off the page- far more than viewing copy on a screen, and more than in just loose manuscript form. Not just copy errors, but actual story element mistakes. It's far better to find all those mistakes in a proof copy, than later in the real published thing. I find it more intuitive to mark up a proof and it's easy to do from anywhere I happen to be. Consolidation of time and effort is a writer's best friend!      A current proof copy of the latest Ribeye book. Note, red lines on every page, margin notes, illustration notes, etc. A proof is a perfect overview of your book in physical form.   And best of all, the process is so ridiculously simple and inexpensive. I use a word processor to format and print my pages correctly, standard inkjet paper, an inkjet printer, and the right kind of glue. I don't need any special book-binding press, nor special tools.   Generally a single black inkjet cartridge at a standard setting will yield about 10 copies of a 200-page (50 sheets x4) book. Consider that I use an Epson printer with cheap knock-off brand cartridges that cost $4 each for black, and you can see that it's quite cost-effective. Print time is roughly 20 minutes for 2 copies of a 200-page book. If a person owns a laser printer, the process is even faster.  The covers are simple to make as well- all one needs is some oversized matte-finish card stock of just the right pound weight, and a paper-cutter to make legal-sized sheets that will go through an inkjet. (Obviously you can't use a 8.5x11" sheet- there's no room for the spine!)      Printing, cutting and gluing your own perfect-bound proofs is far easier than you might think.   I'm thinking of producing a tutorial on the process if anyone is interested. It's easy to do, but there are some pitfalls that I've learned to avoid over the years. One involves cutting. Always make copies in even pairs, for a very simple reason. First off: don't waste time trying to cut the copies yourself. You can take an entire ream of printed copies to the local Kinkos and they'll cut the entire stack for you for a mere 50 cents to $1. However, no cutter in the world will produce two perfect halves! There's almost always a slight overhang of one side or the other. That's why you always print and cut in pairs.   Imagine cutting just one copy. You've got an 8.5x11 stack face up, with the center spread of two facing pages on top. You have the stack cut down the middle, and fold the two cut sections together to form the complete book- only right off you notice a problem- the two halves will almost guaranteed not be perfect. One side will be slightly bigger than another. Even if the difference is only a few millimeters, when you glue the spine, the overhang will cause problems. Look at any perfect-bound book- the spine  has  to be flat.   The solution is never cut uneven numbers of copies. Cut two at a time. The first copy is laid center to center with the second. Each side of the stack forms its own complete copy. When cut down the center- both copies are perfect. A ream ready to be cut, is always a stack of facing pairs.  Anyway, there are a few other details I'd love to outline in a tutorial at some point- the exact glue to use (took me a lot of trial and error to find the best kind and exactly how to spread it to form a perfect bind) exactly how to make the covers, certain crucial do's and don'ts, etc. None of my techniques require complicated book presses, irons or hot glue guns, or other clunky binding set-ups, and produce very nice results that make a comfortably readable book.      It's all in the spine. Flexible enough to bend properly, yet strong enough to bind.   Currently, I'm getting ready to fire up a run of fourth-draft (near finished) copies of the latest Ribeye book, complete with illustrations. At this stage and as with previous drafts- only my creative partner and illustrator Mike gets a copy. We'll both tear the draft apart, make notes in the margins, x-out passages, jot down changes, whatever- then get together and compare notes. I'll then make the changes to the next (hopefully final) draft. Keep in mind, none of this would work very well without a proof copy to hand off. I'd never expect Mike to bother lugging around a loose manuscript, yet a proof copy of the book is perfect.  When it's at a very final stage, I'll send out proof copies to my close family and friends who I always love to have review my work before the absolute final goes out. My mother in particular, an avid reader and very creative person (whom I get most of my own creativity from!) always has good advice after reading my work. My wife of course always has her set of very good suggestions and changes too. The feedback is invaluable, and I'd feel much worse about sending out a final draft to a publisher before I took all this great feedback into consideration. Readable draft copies make that level of extra feedback possible.

       Things are back to normal around my house, now that my wife is back from her trip to her native Estonia and Eastern Europe. Even though she had a great time, she's happy to be back as weeks of travel can be tiring, and indeed there's no place like home! Tonight we'll go through all the photos she took while there- over 2 gigabytes worth that I've got to transfer from her laptop, and I can hear more about all the details of her trip.  We both went to Finland and Estonia together the year before last, so I can personally relate to traveling in this region.  She brought back so much European stuff and many really nice gifts from our friends and family there. Plus she stuffed her luggage with lots of food we can't get in the states. She knows I have a total sweet-tooth, so she brought me plenty of exotic candy from Estonia, Latvia and Finland!     Tons of Eastern European goodies!   We both love to have publications from the countries we've been, so she bought a wide range of material: art books, music CDs children's books, an illustrated calendar, and even a handful of comic books from the Baltic States. Comics are a more respected form of art in Europe than they are in the states, so there's a broad range of them available. Ironically, it's not so much super-heroes and action comics that are popular there, but a lot of funny animal stuff such as Disney comics that were popular state-side in the 1950's.  Well, back to writing, but now I've got plenty of cool Euro-stuff to distract me!

       As Harry mentioned in an earlier post I have been feverishly drawing to get the Ribeye illustrations done for the next book and it's really a lot of fun. Even I enjoy watching a drawing come to life and seeing the characters form in front of me. They almost take on a life of their own. I never know what's going to come out of my pencil until I'm done and so I love to draw because it's always a surprise. That may sound weird but it's true.     The cover illustration of the  urlLink Zaptoons  site this week    I have now finished over 25 drawing and there's at least another twenty to go which kinda makes me sad that I'm almost done. Also I know you're thinking that twenty drawings is still a lot to go but for me, that's about two days of work, maybe three so you see, I really am almost done. Still, there's always the next one! Yeah I know it's sick but I can't help it. I'm having way too much fun for one person to have!

       I have known Harry for&nbsp;nearly 20 years now and we have collaborated on many different projects from  urlLink comics  to  urlLink music  to  urlLink cartoons  and now  urlLink books .   I met Harry in the Fall of 1986 at  urlLink The Joe Kubert School  and he was a skinny teenager and I was a skinny young man. My how things have changed.   The Kubert School had purchased an old mansion as their dorm rooms and it also contained a carriage house on the property which is where Harry lived. I lived in the mansion and we really didn't become friends until the following summer but we did know each other. Harry likes to tell the story of the first time we met.   The story goes that Harry was visiting some friends over a the mansion when he heard this obnoxious noise coming from another room. Loud laughing and a booming voice. It grated on Harry's nerves instantly. Wondering who was making all that racket, he looked around the corner to find this loud-mouthed obnoxious kid with long hair laughing and making way too much noise. He thought to himself "What an annoying guy!"   Funny thing is, shortly we would become best friends although he would still comment from time to time that I was a loud and obnoxious dude and some would say I still am ;-)   Still, Harry and I did find something in common- music and our friendship was sealed when we wanted to make a cartoon and together and decided that we needed music for it.   It was called  The Hole Thing  and perhaps Harry would be so kind as to post it someday. It mostly consisted of various animals and things coming out of a hole with music. Riveting to say the least. Nevertheless, we enjoyed it and soon we had twelve projects going at once, with none of them ever really being focused on. That was one of the biggest things early on that we had in common was a lack of focus. So much creative energy can sometimes be a distraction and we had huge helpings of it.We had so many irons in the fire we never reawslly could concentrate on one thing at a time. We usded to joke that it was "  Making the Happy Meals before the film was done " and to some degree we just recently figured out how to stop that and focus on one thing- Ribeye the Bullbarian.   I remember how Harry showed me these little comics he did while growing up and they fascinated me. No bigger than an index card they were lovingly illustrated and very detailed in their stories. Some were superhero comics and others were about this raccoon aptly named  Rack  and his son  Racky . It was fascinating and I had never seen anyone ever do anything like it before in my life. Harry gave me that belief that we could do anything. Something that is rare.  Sure  we could make a cartoon! Of course we could write and draw comics! Why not?  Doggone  right we could write and record songs! He was fearless. I was always amazed by Harry's belief in himself and eventually in me as well.   Over the years I have come to have more confidence in what I am doing by simply hanging out with him and for that I am truly indebted. Just a short conversation with Harold J. inspires the heck out of me and when it's over my mind is swirling with new concepts, ideas and funny little cartoons and characters. Harry brings that out in people.   The future for  urlLink Zaptoons  (named after a stray cat Harry picked up) at this stage looks very bright indeed and I look forward to all of the things we have going. Yes we still have quite a few irons in the fire but as we grow older we've started to learn how to balance them better and I, for one, am just about to burst sometimes with all the creative possibilities the future holds!

       On Friday I saw the latest animated scenes on our short cartoon for Warner Brothers Animation called 'The Jackalope Boyz'. The project is really coming along! A number of the scenes look particularly good- the character animation is handled very competently, and the final rendered backgrounds are just pure eye-candy.   It's hard to explain what an amazing thing it is: first&nbsp;for&nbsp;Mike and I to &nbsp;see voice talent create unique voices for the characters we've created, and act out the stories and dialogue we've written. Then to witness everything coming together;&nbsp;animated characters brought to life and a film shaping around a framework of one's own ideas, creation, and writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's all &nbsp;just an incredible experience.   I'm so fortunate I've been able to see stories and ideas Mike and I have written brought to life this way. We've been very fortunate to have had the experience a number of times, and it never ceases to thrill me.   This weekend I'm tightening up the fifth-draft of 'Sands of Fate' and I'll be firing up the 'presses' to make a very-complete proof version. This 'ARC' version will go out to close family and friends and includes about 95% of Mike's final illustrations, and my layout illustrations standing-in for the rest.   This ARC will have the original 'viper' cover. However, we're re-doing the book's cover for the final release. I received much advisement that the original cover we did was way too violent-looking, and didn't portray the true 'fun and lighthearted' nature of the book itself. I really had to take a step back and come to the conclusion that this advice was correct. A person really does have to take the advice and criticism of others into consideration- that's why I welcome input from others with open arms. I consider myself blessed to have a number of folks whose sage advice I really trust. It ultimately only makes my efforts that much better to weight their input. Ultimately, Mike and I came to an agreement over the original cover design, and we're changing it. I now like our new concept far better than the old. It's one of those things that's a twist on an old adage: if it doesn't kill your project, it will only make it stronger!

       Today I've been going through the latest draft of my current book line-by-line, and word-by-word. Lately I had been thinking, "This book is in pretty good shape!" but as I really tear the guts out of it, I find that there seems to always be something that I could do better. And so it goes: re-write, re-write, re-write. That's got to be some kind of writer's mantra.  I always find myself wondering, no matter what project I'm working on, when and where will that magic moment come when I'm able to sit back and say with confidence, "Okay, it's finished!" and really mean it.  I have days where I think, "Man, I'll never get this exactly the way I want it!" and other days where I'm thinking, "It's in pretty good shape." Today was one of the "Mission Impossible" days. But I'm sure tomorrow my outlook will shift back to "Hey, this is going to work nicely." And so on.  One thing remains a constant however: I enjoy the heck out of writing. It's one endeavor above all others that I want to pursue with the most blood, sweat and toil for the rest of my days. Well... if I can avoid more of the 'blood' sacrifice than the others and still get my writing done, that'll be fine too.  There's nothing quite like finding something you really love so much that despite it being hard, challenging, brain draining, nerve-wracking work, you find that there are few other things on earth you'd rather be doing.  For me, that's the art of writing.  Basically, I love the whole process of putting together a project, and working with Mike on the entire 'package' as a whole. Mike never quite knows how an illustration is going to come out, and finds the end result a surprise even to himself. I'm the same way with envisioning a finished book.   I have something of an image in my mind that I'm shooting for; I can quasi-picture how the finished work will look, feel and read. I'm very much a stickler about final 'look and feel' of a project. I want the finished book to reflect a certain vision I have for the work as a whole. I try my best to remain true to that vision. But despite it all, I won't know for certain what exact souffle this whole crazy recipe of words and art will bake, until that fateful moment when I'm holding the final result in my hands. That finished creation will be familiar work in some sense, yet at the same time a total surprise to me. I always get a major rush at that exact moment I first see the final results. It's as exhilarating as a thousand Christmas mornings put together!

       Ahh yes, the good ol' days! Sometimes I simply can't believe how much times have changed- and the ways&nbsp; my friends and I&nbsp;have changed too over the years. I look at the 'kids' in these old photos and can't believe that was really us!           Mike Milo and Harry McLaughlin in San Francisco, 1990             Mike Milo at his drawing desk in Parsippany, New Jersey in early 1990   just before the big move out west. Mike&nbsp;was&nbsp;probably working on animation for 'Tiny Toon Adventures', or any of the various freelance gigs he had at the time. All around his animation desk are various Zaptoons comic books, model sheets,&nbsp;and artwork from the animated projects we were always working on.

       When I was a young boy my mom wanted me to be an artist. I wasn't always so sure. My mom used to love to tell everyone about when I was 5 and someone asked me what I was going to be when I grew up. My answer was "a clay man in the army".    Now what that is exactly, I'm not quite sure but it was obvious to my mom that I was going to be an artist. It wasn't, however, so obvious to me. In fact I once had the belief that I never wanted to be an artist because I didn't want anyone to be telling me how to draw. I was just going to draw "my own way" and not listen to anyone about how to do it the right way. Kinda stupid when I think back on it.   Still, I kept drawing and never stopped. An old teacher of Harry and mine told us we had to rack up a lot of pencil mileage before we were good at animation and he was right. You can see a smattering of old animation Harry and I made  urlLink here    We had a ton of fun on these old cartoons and I wouldn't trade it for anything. It's this stuff that helped me on my first job as a Character Layout artist on  urlLink Tazmania  starring the Tazmanian Devil where we used a process called  urlLink Character Layout  which involved blowing up the storyboard and adding subtle nuances and drawing every key frame that you see in the final film. It was like "Animating Lite" and I really loved it. Some shows still use this method such as The Simpsons and King of the Hill. It's one of the reasons the shows are so successful. Quite a few old Warner Bros. cartoons were made employing this method such as  Animaniacs, Tiny Toons, Tazmania, Batman the Animated Series  to name a few. Disney used this method as well on a few of their shows, primarily  Around the World with Timon and Pumbaa  and T he Shnookums and Meat Funny Cartoon Show    It's too bad that Character Layout has all but disappeared because it allowed newcomers to learn how a film was made by making you figure out camera moves and staging. Sadly quite a few artists today in the Animation Biz know nothing of these core elements and as such animation suffers with bad cartoons as a result.

       Man! Yeah I have to agree, Flash is pretty much all the things I've ever hoped for in a film producing package. One of the greatest things about Flash is that you can make a film in a day if you want and although it might look like crap at the end, it's still a film and you've done it and it's a finished piece of art. I sometimes get lil' ideas that I don't want to spend weeks on but still want to make such as  urlLink Cirrus  and  urlLink Just Desserts  or  urlLink Monk mischief .

        urlLink Macromedia Flash  is the most amazing program! Back in our art school days, both Mike and I used to wish for something even half as useful as Flash. We both used to say: "What if there was some affordable system that allowed you to create animated cartoons right in the comfort of your own home, without exceedingly expensive camera stands, film, and frame-by-frame shot capable equipment!?"  It doesn't sound like much of a request nowadays, but up until fairly recent times, there was literally nothing that fit the bill.  In the old days we were dependant upon an extremely expensive 3/4" video editing deck owned by the art school we attended. This machine was capable of recording separate audio and video tracks, and more importantly, able to capture a single frame of video at a time. Hooked to a camera stand, it allowed us to create pencil test animation. (See main menu-Toons/Pencil tests.) At least we got to animate, but it was near impossible to do create anything that looked finished, without going the added (ridiculously expensive) route of preparing finished color art work, IE: painted backgrounds and painted clear acetate animation cels. Such a setup is simply not feasible outside of a major animation studio.  Computers always seemed the logical route, but even these we tend to take for granted today. When I did my first computer animation in 1989, any system that was beefy enough to handle color graphics and animation, was still outrageously expensive. Systems that today would only be suitable as doorstops cost in the neighborhood of $5,000 and up.  Mike bought an expensive video deck in the early 1990's called a Lyon/Lamb pencil test system. It had frame by frame recording, but no flying erase head. Therefore in order to shoot a complete project, you had to do so IN ONE SITTING! You couldn't start and stop shooting animation as you pleased; if you stopped recording frames and started again, you'd get a nasty video glitch between the start/stop points. So we had to do all the animation first, test individual scenes, and then have crazy marathon all-day shoots of entire projects. One glitch or mistake in shooting (which is likely when shooting stacks of animation) would screw up an entire production. It was an insane way to work!  Later on, Mike got an Amiga, and he managed to do some animation with that. I experimented with any Mac or PC I could get my hands on, but for the longest time, creating animation with them was hit and miss.  Flash-forward (literally) to today, and Flash is pretty much exactly what we were dreaming about all along. It's like having the most powerful multi-plane animation stand and frame capture system ever devised, all on your desktop. Keep in mind that most Flash animation you see on the web has to be compromised somewhat in order to keep it a downloadable size, but the program is capable of producing stunning broadcast quality output for film and video. Many new TV animation productions currently in Hollywood are being done entirely in Flash. The beauty of this is that actual in-house animation is returning to LA studios. This is an industry that has since the early 1980's shipped virtually all of its animation production overseas to the orient. The fact that some of this can now be stemmed with in-house Flash production is nothing short of miraculous.  Anyhow, I'm just amazed at how versatile this application is. Anyone who is interested in doing animation should learn Flash. I envy the current young generation that will grow up with incredible tools like this readily available. It'll be amazing to see what the next generations of creative folks do with all the technological advances they are growing up with.

       I should travel more often. My wife recently pointed out to me that I seem to get a lot of good writing ideas when we're on the road somewhere. I always take a small laptop or portable computer with me, and whenever the chance comes up, I'm busy writing.  During a trip we took to Eastern Europe in 2002, I wrote the outline for 'Ribeye the Bullbarian and the Jewel of Baloni' during that trip. There was a lot of time we spent sitting on airplanes, on trains, ferryboats, etc. that was excellent writing time. I did a lot of writing outdoors in a big public park in Tartu, Estonia, and in the Esplanade Park in central Helsinki, Finland.  I simply love to travel to other places, and write there, amid an atmosphere that inspires me in some different way than my home in Los Angeles. I'm a big fan of taking weekend writing sabbaticals, driving somewhere where I won't have too many distractions of home, and writing. I just recently went on a 're-writing/editing' sabbatical in Palm Springs, one of my favorite places to get away.  At the start of 2003, I had to travel back and forth several times to North Carolina and Virginia to deal with a family medical emergency. Though none of it was by any means a trip for pleasure, the good that came out of it (besides seeing my family) was that I did a huge amount of writing during the travel time. Large sections of my first novel were written in hotel rooms in North Carolina, in the air over the country, and in airport stopovers all across the country.  I like to think a little bit of each place I travel shows up in my stories. There are always people to meet and places to see that spark the imagination. I find that the wide-open spaces of the American West in particular can't help but inspire a writer. Every rock mesa, every canyon, every cliff, every painted desert vista tells a story all to itself.  Last summer I was stranded for five days in the Mojave desert. I had gone for a day drive and my car's radiator blew up. (Thank God for both AAA and cell phones by the way). I had to have my car towed 38 miles from the middle of nowhere to the sleepy outskirts of Barstow California, and there I was stuck in a hotel for five days while the parts had to be ordered to fix my car. I always have a portable computer with me, so I spent those five days writing, even though I hadn't planned them. A three hour tour, turned into a five day mini-exile.  Right next door to the motel I stayed in, was a small farm with a chicken coop out back. Just watching those chickens gave me some ideas for an book/cartoon series Mike and I had been kicking around for years called 'The Barnyard Avenger'. I spent those few days dreaming up Barnyard Avenger situations, as well as outlining some other projects. What could have been terrible downtime, turned out to be an unexpected windfall.  Little unexpected things like that are the best forms of inspiration. Naturally, I love the idea of traveling and writing. Even if it's only driving out of town for the weekend, and parking myself in the shade of a Yucca tree somewhere in the California desert and working on a chapter or two, getting out of the house and out into the world is a major inspiration that keeps me writing.
