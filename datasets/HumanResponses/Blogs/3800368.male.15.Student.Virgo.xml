      Cheerio mates, 2day wasn't too bad but it wasn't good either so lets just say it was....normal. Its started out bad cuz I overslept til like 2:30 when I had plans with Tim at 11:30 to go to the local EB games and the bike trail. But, we did get a chance to hang out like 5 mins after I got up, lol. but we didnt go to EB but we did go to 7-11 which was kinda worthless cuz we got this wanna-be surge drink that had a messed up after-taste. but it was cool. I did this awesome tailslide while riding off the trail to test my new diamondback, woo7. And, the rest of the day was just boring, I had to babysit my mom's co-worker's son, but   honestly I didnt watch him, i just went back in my room and watched T.V. and yea the next couple hrs arent important so...yea, but now I'm on the phone with Kevin and Maria which I have been for a couple hrs now. Kinda funny how you can stay on the phone for so long and talk about nothing. Hah, being a teenager is confusing experience.  piece.

      nice title eh? its the name of one of my fav songs ^_^ anywho, 2day has been a typical day for the most part, which is cool, i guess.I woke up around 1:30 this afternoon, probaly since i was up til like 4 o clock last night on the computer and/or watching tv, there was like a 5 shows of mad tv in a row and i watched them all, lol then some infomercial for a "male enchancement pill" came on (why cant they just say a penis growth pill, like no one knws what the hell a male enhancement is -__-) and yea i wasnt gonna just sit there and watch that so thats when i decided to go to bed. then i woke up and ate a fruit salad for breakfast then awhile later got on AIM theeeen kevin called but i had to call him back later since my mom was on the phone, and yea we talked for alil then my mom decided to go out since it was her b-day, to look for her a new bike, she wanted to go to wal-mart (just.....no) for one but i convinced her to go to like Dick's (sporting goods store) or like the Catonsville Bike shop, she chose Dick's since i got my bike from there, ummmn yea we looked at bikes and this new bike rack thingiemajig, for the truck. she picked this pretty decent GT front fork suspension mountain bike, for like 250 (hah my bike was 330, i win). that took like an hour to get over with then we went to Compusa for some ink for the printer, a new mouse , and keyboard   for the comp (duh). We couldnt find the right type of ink for the printer cuz we have to get each color (cyan, light cyan, black, magenta, light magenta, and yellow) and they only had light magenta. so my mom just decided to get the keyboard and mouse. i finally have a optical mouse instead of that damn trackball mouse. then after that, she decided to go to dinner, at this place called sunset over in glen burnie, and i hate that place so i wanted to go home, my mom gave me a 20 to order a pizza with. ^_^ like 20 mins after i got home, i install the keyboard and mouse and decided to order the pizza from domino's. i ordered a large pepperoni, sausage, and ham thin crust (oh yea im healthy *sarcasm* it took like 15 mins for the pizza to come when the dude said it would be 45 mins, he lied to me.i should get 5 bucks back for that >>', it took an hr and an half for me to finish off the pizza, cuz the phone kept ringing, damnit and after that i just chilled around the house. around 10:30 my mom came back, she went to the store and got those mini little bottles of dasani (sp?) waters, which is awesome, to me atleast lol. and yea thats pretty much how my day went.

      yea, its been a couple days since i updated but what can ya do? well yesterday was kinda fun yet depressing at the same time. For some reason i started thinking why do i always hide behind my own shadow, sorta speak. Like how somethings bothering me, i'll never speak up and tell anyone, i always just mask it with a sorta smile or not smile at all (which i normally do)and keep going, i doubt that its because im shy or anything tho, anywho (still on the topic of yesterday) i went to the mall/movies, with kevin, maria, kris, and luke. It started out really cool, but as the day went on it kinda got alittle tiresome but i picked on maria the whole while (haha biotch XP). we went to see dodgeball, it didnt turn out as good as i thought it would though which also sucks. then after that we went to the arcade, that was kinda fun, not too much to turn around the whole day but just enough. I beat kevin....again in tekken 4 and now he cant say that the button was suck which caused him to loose, because it wasnt, then a couple mins later since i was over playing some tennis game that was kinda out of the view from the group i decided to go get a icee, so as i did that, i came back to atleast finsih the tennis game but it took my quarter (bitch) and i saw my mom walk out of one of the movies, and i really wanted to leave cuz i ready to go, so i went with my mom and maria came around walking to the restroom and passed by my mom and me and then my mom asked who was she and i told her, and me knowing my mom of course shes going to turn around and speak, which she did. while leaving i didnt say peace to anyone which to me ive done plenty of times before and dont find it that big of a deal but maria said kris was pissed over it (big whoops)then we went to columbia crossing to get to the macaroni grill (my fav resturaunt) and yea had dinner, then went home. the only thing im actually happy about is that i finshed my 1st graphic over the size of 400x400 and version 2 of my site is underconstruction. woo7

      Well since i forgot to update yesterday i'll just add it to this entry along with hows 2day going and i'll just predict the rest of the day. Well yesterday was a pain the ass to start with since i didnt get any sleep yesterday night and i had to ride to EB with to to make up for my laziness from the other day. That was one of the worst bike rides ever. my bike seat broke a-bunch of times  but i was able to repair itand my lock kept falling off. other than that, I chose to ride there on to me, one of the hottest days of the summer. I was soo glad to make it to the store since they have A/C (like any normal store would) and they had spiderman 2 the game demo out on a playable display which was awesome since i stood there and played it for a couple mins, i couldnt really enjoy it cuz Tim kept bugging me -__-'then after a few more mins he decided to go but i wasnt ready at all, that A/C felt like heaven, but i didnt argue cuz it was almost time for me to get home anyway. The ride back home wasnt all that bad due to there being more hills going up while going than coming back. I stopped at 7-11 and got that Sobe energy drink, it reeeally good but i dunno why they come in such small cans. well, the rest of the day was a drag so i'll skip it. Aqua teen was halarious and umnn yea that was the high point of my night...then i went to bed..Today started out ok, i slept til like 12 and ate cherrios, my mom told me to pack some clothes cuz we're staying at the embassy suites cuz my uncle and aunt are coming from ohio for the 4th of july and they're staying there and my mom whats to stay there too, i guess it'll be ok, they do have a indoor pool (awwwesome) and my younger cousin is coming too so thats cool but i doubt other than that it'll be any fun. oh well.  peace.

      uuh yea...  2day was pretty typical for meh, nothing exciting...at all. for some reason tim was raggin on me alot 2day, only if he knew, i could have got him bck good about him and his little (literally) crush but im a nice fellow and plus sysy was in the chat and that would be just embaressing. my mom took me bck the state park and to let me get some good shots of patapsco river, that was fuuuun, i got about 3 good shots cuz i forgot to adjust the brightness setting since it was outside.  i sat in a squat for 10 mins to help my legs hold football positions better, aaand it works o.O. thats about it for 2day

      another meaningless title brought 2 you by yours truely.  the past few days have been okay, i guess, with some bad things happening along with some good things, like 2day how i learned a new digital art technique (im quite proud of myself ^_^) and seeing new hope for me making varsity this yr after talking to zach, who played in his freshman year, said tryouts are easy and just about everyone makes the team, al they do for tryouts is run the 100 yrd field and see who can do the distance, push those carrier things, preform stances, and hit people with the pads. those dont seem hard at all, the only thing i  would  have a problem with is running the whole field thing, but i am trying out for a lineman, so i dont think they would stress that part as much as they would with someone trying out for a WR. (next subject) my mom is being all over-protective since one of her policy holders got hit by a car this weekend, its annoying the hell out of me cuz she brings it up everyday since it happened and she even wants me to go to the funeral, like hell if i am, not to be mean or anything, but i didnt even knw the lady, so why would i be there -_- (nextsubject) this is day 3 of me constantly listening to taking back sundays new cd, for some reason i always do this when i get a new cd but oh well.(next subject) im starting on version 2 of my site, which is awesome cuz i just learned some new flash techniques, that im going to apply to my site (next subject) well sysy played a trick on me and admitted that she was behind it yesterday (the prank was from a week ago, and it was some dude that she knew , who IMed me acting like some girl from school........gay -_-..i knew she was behind it all along tho but thats besides the point) well i told tim, and he came up with some idea that i had to tell sysy that i asked a girl out and she said yes and tim would act like the girl( i have to say it was quite funny at the beginning) i never thought the joke would actually work nor did i knw sysy was so gullable, but anywho, we carried on the joke for like 30 mins, then kevin got into it and went to find some random girl pic and acted like that was the girl tim was pretending to be knwn as "liz" then it continued for like 10-15 more mins then we all left it alone, but during the whole thing we were all wondering did she knw it was a joke, then we decided to go ahead and tell but not straight foward, but through like different little hints like how tim said "liz" last name was mattingly, which should have gave it away......................but it didnt -____- then after that i think he tried a couple more hints and then just left it alone but we still werent sure if she knew or not, ok then we all just gave up and told her, she took it way more harsh than i thought and blocked all of us then made an entry in her LJ that kevin linked me to and it said stuff about me and how mad she was and...stuff (gawd me and my no emotions) it felt like i was obligated to make a comment on it which i did saying i was sorry....and stuff, like it helped any, but she did unblock which is a plus i guess. she hates me now which i dont knw why it was just a joke, if you cant take one dont make one (as chessy as it sounds, i stand behind it) she pulled one on me, so i did one back, and im the one whos suppose to feel guilty -_-, not fair.........not fair at all.

      woo another title from a song that has no meaning whatsoever to the main idea of the entry (well maybe alil) i got the new tbs (taking back sunday) cd 2day and im really pleased with it, its way better than the first, imo but both are cool none the less, (next subject) now that i knw i have to tryout for football, i have been trying to jog or ride my bike everyday to atleast increase some stamina b4 the tryouts on the 14th, i knw i wont make the team since i just started conditioning with only 2 weeks left til tryouts (;_;) but im trying anyway(next subject) yesterday i went to towson w/ maria to the mall and places that was around the mall....area, the bike/outdoor store over there is awesome, those bikes cost a penny and lets see i picked on her the whole day which was fun cuz she deserved every bit of it but in return i got hit in my sensitive area(;____;) mark my words, she will pay tho, mwhahahaha (next subject) i tried propel, that shiz isnt as good as i thought and i tried the new powerade arctic shatter, that was awesome, its like a rehydrating lemonade o.O and yea thats pretty much it     P.S-like the new layout? i was bored with the other one
