						   Sorry for my long delay - I tried to de-frag my computer, which didn't work, so I just re-set all my defaults, which seems to work ok so far.  Again, not much baseball news to talk about, but the overwhelming theme here in the Houston area is  The Super Bowl .  There's a lot of NFL-related activities going on in The Woodlands, too, which has officially been designated Football Town, USA for the weekend.  Honest.  In fact, all the CBS guys are staying about 2 minutes from where I work.  Too bad Jim Nantz or Dan Marino or Deion Sanders don't want tennis lessons, because I'd probably be the one to give it to them.  The game itself may not be the most exciting Super Bowl ever, but I think it should be low-scoring and close.  In the end, though, I think both teams stop the run but Tom Brady is just a little bit better than Jake Delhomme, so the  Patriots  win, 13-10.  Now that I'm getting on-line again, Drew should send me Round 2 of The Sandman's Tournament pretty soon, so look for it.    Enjoy the game tomorrow!

						   I finally got my certification from the USPTA yesterday: I'm an official tennis teaching professional now.  I was ranked as a Professional-2, but if I retake the exam I only have to re-do the group and private lessons, which are notoriously difficult to get a Professional-1 score on.  Now I have to decide whether I should stick with the racquets and clothes that I've been wearing or "sell out" and sign a contract to use only HEAD racquest and wear LOTTO clothing while I teach, in return for getting all that stuff for free.  It's a tough one, since I have to send my contract in by Saturday and I've never played with a HEAD racquet in my life, though I do have a demo racquet on the way (should be here any minute now).  In other news, I'm ready for Round 2, Drew.  Let's rumble.  P.S.  Marat Safin is back.  He's now taken out 5 (!!) Americans in the Aussie Open: Vahaly, Martin, Blake, Roddick, Agassi.  Whoa.

						   Jason's detailed explanation:  "Food is my Scrabble" - Barstool

						   Mom talks about her Scrabble (or lack thereof):  "Hi Jack! I bet you don't get many responses from your (legions of) female readers revealing their personal obsessions.  Why not?  Because we ladies just don't think that way.  We do obsess, but about personal and (practical) stuff: food, clothing, and shelter. You see, it's All about Us, and our loved ones (an extension of Us).  We are under-represented in the  highest levels of competion in cerebral games (chess, Scrabble, bridge) not because we don't have the brainpower, but because  those things are just too removed from our personal lives ...we're not willing to devote our energy to things that are so abstract.  We'll use our analytical skills to find the best bargains, learn to prepare the most delicious and nutritious recipes,  or dissect the intimate lives of our friends.  All close to home.  You guys, on the other hand, seem to need to escape from "home" (and from Us???!) by obsessing about sports and politics,  or daydreaming about space exploration (about as far away as you can get!) Perhaps this has something to do with why you fellas enjoy fantasy the world so much, whether in sports leagues, epic movies, video games, or erotica.   That's all I have to say about that.  madre.

						   Not much baseball news lately, so let's try something new.  I just finished  Word Freak , this awesome book about Scrabble.  Yep: Scrabble.  It's not really a book about strategy or how to improve - basically, a Wall Street Journal reporter took a year off from work to become a full-time Scrabble player.  This has happened before in other fields - I'm almost sure a guy who was doing a report on the  World Series of Poker  entered the $10,000 event and made it to the final table.  This book doesn't quite have such a happy ending - the guy, Stefan Fatsis, becomes an above-average but not expert player - but the characters he profiles are fascinating.  None of them are normal, and Fatsis theorizes that for anyone to become an expert Scrabble player - which requires hours memorizing words, practicing anagrams, and memorizing more words - you have to be a little obsessive about the game.  But this got me to thinking, if this is true for Scrabble, wouldn't it be true for anything, really?  Am I obsessed with the Astros?  With tennis?  With video games?  With Keira Knightley?  I think we all have our 'Scrabble', in one form or another, whether it's a sport, a game, a hobby...whatever.  If you want, IM me with whatever fascinates you, and I'll post results tomorrow.

						   Lots of hella good Astros news to talk about this weekend.  Let's jump right in:  Tim Redding was officially named the 5th starter a few days ago by manager (and JT's nemesis) Jimy, "One M" Williams.  I love this move.  I was terrified that Jeriome Robertson would be named the 5th starter because of his insanely lucky 15-9 record last year.  Taking out the wins and losses, which pitcher would you rather have:  Pitcher A  160.2 IP  180 Hits  23 HR's  64 BB  99 K's  5.10 ERA  1.52 WHIP  Pitcher B  176 IP  179 Hits  16 HR's  65 BB  116 K's  3.68 ERA  1.39 WHIP  There's no comparison between these two guys.  Pitcher B is better in every category.  Tim Redding is much better than Jeriome Robertson, and younger too.  While I'm talking about Robertson, I really think our best bet is to trade him ASAP, while his  15 games won in his rookie year!  sheen hasn't worn off yet.  Even after we lose Clemens next year we should have much better options in Carlos Hernandez, the eternally underrated Kirk Saarloos, Brandon Duckworth, and maybe even Taylor Bucholz ready to go.  What, exactly, do we trade him for?  Bench help or prospects.    With the Astros lineup currently looking like this:  Biggio Ensberg Berkman Bagwell Kent  Hidalgo Ausmus  Everett P  there's a good chance that we'll get a sub-750 OPS out of the bottom three hitters EVERY DAY.  Jason Lane and Orlando Palmeiro will hopefully get the bulk of PH at-bats, with the rest going to...Jose Vizcaino.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Jose Vizcaino should be your last option off the bench.  I admit, he's had some big hits.  Hell, I saw him take Mark Friggin' Prior deep.  But he hasn't posted a 350 OBP in 8 years, and he's NEVER posted a 400 SLG.  He's about to be 36 years old.  He is not a guy I want up frequently in late game situations.  We need a backup corner IF with some power.  A guy like Russell Branyan, even though he strikes out in half of his at-bats, would have been nice.  Surely a guy like Robertson could bring in someone like that.  If not, the Astros farm system isn't exactly loaded.  A prospect or two would be great.  Finally, we're supposed to sign Dave Veres soon.  I'm ok with this signing; Veres is 37, and his ERA jumped up to 4.68 last year, but his K rate is steady, and he's death on lefties.  My only concern is this might over-crowd the bullpen.  Here's everyone that's got a chance to make it:  Dotel (lock) Lidge (lock) Ricky Stone (should be a lock) Dan Miceli (probably a lock) Dave Veres (probably a lock) Duckworth/Saarloos/Roberston/Hernandez/Gallo  I might even be forgetting someone.  Those first five guys are all righties; I'm sure we're going to have at least one lefty.  It's possible they're signing Veres so that we have a lefty-killer so we can carry all righties, but I kinda doubt it.  So that leaves two out of the last five that I listed to make the bullpen (we'll carry 12 pitchers max, and we've got our 5 starters), and I'm betting at least one will be a lefty (Roberston / Hernandez / Gallo), so that means that either Duckworth or Saarloos get left out.  I guess having so many bullpen options is not a terrible problem to have, but I want Duckworth and Saarloos on the team.  I think Dan Miceli should be the odd man out - I wish we hadn't re-signed him.  My ideal bullpen would then be:  Dotel (closer) Lidge (main set-up) Duckworth (secondary set-up) Stone (righty-killer) Veres (lefty-killer) Saarloos (middle relief / 6th starter) Hernandez (middle relief / 6th starter / LHP)  Wow.  That's a pretty damn good bullpen, if I say so myself.  Just bump Miceli, trade off Roberston for a lefty bat...holy crap.    Finally, I know I always say the Astros could have done some things better, but the reality is we've had an awesome off-season.  I can't wait for the season to start.  Take care, peoples.

						   Nicole hijacks my blog again, to talk about TV and other assorted things:  "Somewhere in LA, the last episode ever of Friends is being filmed today. The one-hour episode will air May 6 after a one-hour retrospective. It’s likely that the show will set a record for the sixth straight season as the highest-rated comedy on television. Still not impressed? To note the significance of the show, thirty second ads for the finale are reportedly being sold for $2 million! Now that’s almost as much as companies shell out for Super Bowl commercials. However, the shortened season means the inevitable reruns. It’s almost February sweeps, so I can hold out. On the other hand, NBC pulled through this week with a new episode of Scrubs.    Now there is something I have noticed about scrubs…they are big. A few years ago I got a pair of scrub pants for a sorority thing and although I ordered the smallest size, I think I could fit three of me in there. When I worked in a hospital, the “small” scrubs still dragged on the floor and were not at all attractive (somehow on TV they manage to get ones that fit…hmmm, not so real) Anyway, this brings me to a disturbing fact. Women’s clothing stores are doing a very bad thing: they are changing the size of their clothes. “Why is this bad?” you ask. Well, I will tell you. It means people are getting fatter. Stores want people to buy clothes so they make the big clothes have smaller sizes to make the fat people feel better about themselves and think that they wear the same size they did ten years ago. And therein lies the problem. If the big clothes have the small sizes, the clothes that used to be the small sizes are no longer existent. For someone like me this is unbelievably frustrating because I can no longer buy anything in normally priced stores…it kinda takes the fun out of shopping.    Luckily some things are still fun. One of these is going to see a very good Vandy basketball game (I believe this was mentioned a few days ago) The Vandy/Florida game was by far the best I have been to in a long time. In addition, the conclusion has been made that the top balcony in Memorial (on the student side) is The Place to watch a game. And to celebrate the victory, nothing less than Maggie Moo’s (yes in January) and some rousing video games would be acceptable."

						   Sorry for the one-day hiatus.  It's been a busy tennis-filled week for me.  This afternoon I've been watching some of the Australian Open, including a match between Mark Phillipoussis and Fabrice Santoro.  These two guys are probably as different as two athletes can be: Phillipoussis is a 'hunk' (according to Mom) - 6'5'', muscular, huge serve, huge forehand.  Santoro, on the other hand, is about 5'8'', agile, all touch, angle, and guile.  It's a great matchup, and it's inspiring to watch, kinda like watching a tennis version of 'Rudy'.  Santoro takes the first set, then Phillipoussis comes back to win, but it's still awesome.  There's more to life than power and strength.  Try a drop shot every now and then.  I think Drew's about through with  The Tournament, Round Two , and I believe Nicole's got another guest column planned, so keep visiting the next few days.

						   And now for something completely different...  There has been a lot of news devoted lately to the news that "Mankind is going back into outer space!" and so on.  I have to admit that I was initially excited by this.  I mean, we could make new discoveries, broaden our horizons, look beyond small, insignificant, Earthly problems...except, it doesn't really work that way.  Here's why, according to Dr. Bill Wade (a.k.a. Pa)   Take me to the stars: why???  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'd like to play devil's advocate about the recent proposal to send a man to Mars by 2020, without reference to any of the political overtones of who's proposing it & why. I have one elementary question:  Can anyone please cite me a single concrete reason why we should do this?—to send humans on a return trip to the moon & thence on to Mars? To me, it is painfully apparent that we have no true justification, only excuses.  The excuses I've heard so far are three:  1.   "One step at a time": we need to send men back to the moon so as to use it as a launching pad for Mars.  - Unh hunh: & the reason for going on to Mars then would be why?.....  2.    "We need new worlds to conquer": gotta keep striving. Personkind needs to reach for the stars, or we will wither up.  - To what extent have we as a species withered in consequence of not returning to the moon these past 25 years? This is an airy-fairy virtual admission that there is no rationale beyond high-falutin' rhetoric.  3.     "We need new worlds to destroy": we're laying waste to Earth, so we better be ready to move on.  - Is this not the drug addict's explanation as he panhandles for money for the next fix?—is it not far wiser to give up the habit entirely? Even so, we can better use those bucks to help stop our laying waste to the Earth. Is that not the more useful & noble task? I think so.  Just for practice, perhaps someone can cite one reason why we went to the moon in the first place? And by a reason, I mean a justification in & of itself, nearly merely because we felt compelled to be there prior to any Russians. As best I can tell, the only candidate explanations are so that: a) Neil Armstrong could deliver a noble one-liner—oops, he blew it: he meant to say "small step for A man", & b) so that Alan Shepard could set the world (sic) record for distance on a golf shot.   In contrast, I can supply you with ample concrete reasons why it is wise not to include human beings in our space exploration endeavors for the time being. But the two strongest arguments—deaths & unneccessary expense—should suffice to keep our feet on the ground for now.   I'm more than open to a future policy change if & when the stars are better aligned; in fact I can promise that—no longer being here—I will not utter a single word against it.  I know it's alluring to have something like the first man setting foot on Mars during one's lifetime. I know many of you young folks would not only enjoy seeing a man reach Mars, but feel slighted that the moon missions were over & done before you were born, & would perhaps feel even more slighted if Mars was never reached during your lifetime. I'm one of many millions fortunate enough to have watched the moon landing on tv. But I don't believe that our government should throw money at every program that might make me or you or other Americans feel good. I believe that part of maturity is learning to accept that there are feel-good goals not worth their price. And for what it's worth, remember that Americans quickly got over the excitement of the moon landings in the 1970's & paid essentially no attention to the later missions, aside from Apollo XIII's near non-survival. In the absence of a true compelling purpose, such things are simply not all that you dream they will be.

						   Ultra fast road trip recap: Drive up good.  McDonald's good.  Sports bar good.  New England-Indy game bad.  Sunshine Wheat beer good.  JT's computer good at first.  Then bad.  Then worse.  Carolina-Philly game bad.  JT's computer still damn bad.  Sleep good.  JT's computer fixed!  Wait, no, still bad.  Watching tennis good.  Watching tennis in 30 degree wind chill bad.  Chili's good.  Drive back good.  JT's computer good, after 12 straight hours of work on it.  So yeah, it was fun.  The Astros made a couple of moves today, agreeing to terms with Wade Miller (3.4 million), Roy Oswalt (3.25 million), and Octavio Dotel (2.8 million).  I had earlier hypothesized that both Miller and Oswalt would earn 2.5 million and Dotel would get 3 million, but one reason Miller and Oswalt made more money is that Kip Wells, a young pitcher with similar (but lesser) stats, got 2.575 million from the Pirates.  One minor downside to signing both Pettitte and Clemens is that it prevents the Astros from signing, say, Oswalt to something like a 4 year, 20 million dollar deal, which would rock.  But that's small beer.  I think Dotel for 2.8 million is a steal, and that after a 40 save, 2.00 ERA year, his value will suddenly skyrocket and we'll probably lose him to free agency.  But we've got Lidge ready to replace him, although he did struggle near the end of last year.  All three of these deals are fine by me, and avoiding arbitration, during which a club has to put together a case against a player being too valuable, is always nice.  On a side note, Baseball Prospectus disagrees with me with respect to Orlando Palmeiro.  They have listed him as one of the best free agent signings of the off season, saying that he's an excellent fielder, posts a solid OBP, and can still run well.  That is all true, but they're ignoring his HR-every-300-AB's power.  I confess, though, we do need a LH bat, and although I'd prefer Travis Lee or Fred McGriff or (thanks, JT) Jeremy "Little" Giambi, Palmeiro is better than nothing (a.k.a, Jose Vizcaino).  Prospectus also likes the Clemens signing, since Clemens was (according to SNWAR...don't worry about it) the 20th best pitcher in baseball last year, and we got him for 5 million (3.4 deferred).  So the signings of Pettitte, Clemens, and Palmeiro outweigh the initially bad signings of Vizcaino and Ausmus.  It's been a down-then-up kinda offseason, but I like our chances next year.  Coming soon: Drew's Tournament, Round Two.

						   I'm leaving for College Station for a weekend of football and friends soon, so I gotta be brief.  But first:  HOW 'BOUT THEM COMMODORES?  #23 Vanderbilt beat #11 Florida, 86-72, last night.  Vandy had lost two straight SEC games on the road, and we really needed this one.  It was close until we went on an 18-4 run early in the 2nd half, and we pretty much cruised from there.  Matt Freije had 23 pts, Mario Moore had 21, and Corey Smith hit some big 3's during the run.  It looked like an awesome scene at the end of the game, with students storming the court, something that I love to see but have only done twice, I believe, both freshman year: once against LSU, and once against Tennessee.  I'll always remember the one against Tennessee because 1) they're our biggest rivals, 2) they were ranked #4 coming in and 3) the game ended on an alley-oop pass to Dan Langhi (Vandy's best player), who absolutely SLAMMED it home as time expired.  Man, that was awesome.  I can't even really describe it.  Sheer pandemonium.  I won Poker Night last night, mostly thanks to this crazy, crazy hand.  I'll assume you guys know how to play Texas Hold 'Em - if not, look it up real fast.  Anyway, I'm dealt pocket aces - AA.  The flop comes A, J, 2, all offsuit.  The two guys ahead of me (Matt and Brandon) both bet.  I go all in.  I mean, COME ON.  3 of a kind aces.  THEY BOTH CALL.   I couldn't believe it.  Matt flips over his pocket 22.  Brandon flips over his pocket JJ.  WE ALL HAD THREE OF A KIND AFTER THE FLOP.  The odds of that are...staggering.  Seriously.  Anyway, another J or 2 didn't fall, I win big, and then slowly wear down Todd from there, getting lucky on the last hand to finish him off.  Man, poker is fun.  Well, that's it for now.  Round 2 of The Sandman's Tournament should be up pretty soon.  Until then, watch a lot of football!  P.S.  My padres and I always listen to The Puzzler on NPR on Sunday mornings.  Here's today's:  Take the name ' Nestor '.  Using any letter in the name as many times as you can, make a 12 letter word.  Hint: it's not a plural.  For example, the name 'Seurat' makes 'restaurateur'.  Somehow I got this one in like 10 seconds, though I don't know how.    Go Colts!

						    The Sandman’s Uber-Supreme Championship of Toughness   What follows is the first round of The Tournament.  I was sitting down trying to think of something I could write about for Jack’s blog.  I needed something that I knew pretty well, toughness, and something that I could have fun doing (researching toughness and tournaments).  So I skipped class to do some research and write up this monster.  I’m sure some will disagree with the results, but keep in mind, I did research for a whole three hours, which means that I know more than you and my word is law.  So shut your yapper and eat it!  Anyway, some of you will find obvious omissions from the tournament, and I am sorry.  Chuck Norris and Wesley Snipes definitely belong here, but I forgot.  Besides, I give a reason for leaving old Chucky out later in the tournament.  Keep in mind, this is real toughness, not movie toughness.  While I do occasionally draw from the movies in my analysis, this is purely an entertainment aspect.  If movie toughness was considered, Harrison Ford would be in here due to his feats as Indiana Jones and Han Solo.  I hope you enjoy, and I’ll talk to you again when I write up the second round.   Vin Diesel vs. Mr. T  This match can be called the  Battle of the Bouncers .  Yes, both of the fighters were bouncers at one time in their lives.  However, Mr. T once received the award of America’s Toughest Bouncer.  I don’t believe I ever recall Vin Diesel winning this award.  Let’s look at Vin for a bit.  Besides the whole bouncer gig, he doesn’t really have any formal training.  True, he is a big as an ox, but so is Mr. T.  While Vin grew up in a fairly pampered life, Mr. T grew up in the ghetto takin’ care o’ his momma.  The worst thing Diesel ever did was vandalize a theater, which led him to majoring in the second-most wussy subject in college, English.  That’s right Jack, it’s a good thing you didn’t major in English, else I’d have to dub you Señor Pansy.  A minor isn’t quite so damning.  This fight gets ugly when Diesel calls up Mr. T’s momma in his former job as a telemarketer.  This bothers the Mother of Jibba Jabba, and sends Mr. T into a rage.  That’s right, Mr. T uses his skills as a former Chicago wrestling champion to rip Vin Diesel a new one.  Hell, I pity that fool.   Clint Eastwood vs. John Wayne  Here it is ladies and gentlemen!  Or should I say, lady?  I have a feeling that Nicole may be the only female reading this thing.  When I first sat down looking at this matchup, I thought it would be a huge rumble.  However, one of these guys is putting up an enormous front.  He may look hella tough, and he may be pretty über in most of his movies.  However, thinking that a movie career as a tough man would lead people to believe that the Spy Kids were tough.  It just ain’t so.  Clint Eastwood is a huge letdown.  He’s super-polite, and a really nice guy.  Hell, that was his original role in Rawhide.  The people who cast him in that role saw him walking down the hall, and they decided that he looked nice enough to play the character.  How the hell is THAT guy gonna beat John Wayne?  While they both played cowboys, John Wayne really was one in his youth.  Also, while Dirty Harry was possibly Eastwood’s toughest role, John Wayne was actually the original choice of the moviemakers.  Eastwood has always been second fiddle to Wayne, and that’s just going to be the way it’s gonna stay.  John Wayne walks up to Clint Eastwood’s plush hotel room and beats the hell out of his bodyguard in one punch, just like when he did the same to Frank Sinatra’s bodyguard.  Sorry Clint, you’re gonna have to as YOURSELF one question, and it isn’t “Do I feel lucky?”   Alexander Karelin vs. Hulk Hogan  This interesting matchup pits the world of professional wrestling against the world of Olympic wrestling.  Unfortunately, that means comparing a real sport to a fake one.  Granted Hulk Hogan is HUGE, but he’s doing it all under a script.  I’ll give him his due respect though: wrestling, while fake, is incredibly tough.  Those guys endure intense punishment to get out and perform every week, and Hulkamania’s been around a long time.  Hogan’s been taking abuse to his body since he was a little pudgy kid getting beat up by bullies.  The 6-time WWF/WCW/WWE champion has earned the right to be in this tournament, no doubt about it.  Hell, he bodyslammed Andre the Giant at Wrestlemania II to really kick professional wrestling’s popularity into high gear.  However, while Andre was a huge man, he wasn’t less than 5% body fat, which is what his enormous competitor is.  Karelin is also a multi-champion.  He won the Olympics so many times I can’t even remember how many there were.  He hadn’t even been scored on in a decade.  While he did lose recently to a guy almost 20 years younger than him in the most recent games, that was because his hands came apart about an inch for a split second.  In a real fight, that’s not going to be the end of it.  I’m sorry, but Mr. Nanny (in his pink tutu) are going to be reverse body lifted by the Russian Bear.  While the Hulkster has taken multiple pile-drivers, he’s never had a real move performed on him by this beast.   Jackie Chan vs. Jet Li  Here we have the match from the East.  Two Chinese action stars coming to battle it out.  The Drunken Master vs. The One.  Jet Li received his training at the Wushu Academy in Beijing, while Jackie Chan learned his fighting skills in the Seven Fortunes, which trained in an opera school.  Li went on to become the Chinese national champion, while Chan learned all about gymnastics, martial arts, and theater.  Yep, this looks like it’s going to be a good one…  Wait a minute!  No it doesn’t!  Sorry, let me repeat myself.  Jet Li, national champion, vs. Jackie Chan, graduate of opera school.  I looked high and low for more of Jackie’s training, but he received it all at the school.  While it did eventually make him become one of the greatest stuntmen and action entertainers of all time, I don’t think Jet Li is going to be impressed.  Unless Chan can find a couple strange objects lying around, let’s just say he found a Skip-It and a ladder, he stands no chance.  My guess is that Chan starts frantically looking for some props, but Li, who’s obviously become familiar with Chan’s style through watching his plethora of movies, will not let him get anywhere close to anything that could be used by Chan.  Jackie better fight as the Drunken Master, because that’s the only way he’s going to be saved from the pain of the beating he’s about to get.   Steven Seagal vs. Dolph Lundgren  Finally, we have a good match!  Once again, let’s compare the fighters.  Both are masters of their fighting styles, Seagal in Aikido and Lundgren in Karate.  Both have worked as bodyguards.  Both have won championships, with Seagal winning the Aikido championships in Japan and Lundgren winning the European karate heavyweight championship.  I’ll have to admit, I didn’t want to give either of these fighters too much respect.  Seagal has become a joke as of late, and Lundgren… well, let’s just say that I don’t respect a guy who gets the crap kicked out of him in virtually every movie that he’s ever been in.  The tide began to shift Seagal’s way when I learned about his previous wins over other tough guys.  Yes, Steven was hired to train none other than James Bond himself, Sean Connery, during the filming of a Bond movie.  He must have gotten a little pissed at his accent though, because he ended up breaking the Scotsman’s wrist.  However, shouldn’t a martial arts expert be able to control his body well enough to prevent himself from hurting the ones around him?  Perhaps this means that his skill was slipping a bit.  Lets look at how these two guys aged.  Seagal has become a fat man who gets no respect in the movies anymore.  His mind is also slipping a bit with his tendency to write in incredibly bad lines in his environmentally-friendly movies.  Where’s the guy who could kick the hell out of a bunch of sailors with a butcher’s knife?  Dolph, on the other hand, was the team captain of the US pentathlon team for the Olympics in the 90s.  The pentathlon is arguably the toughest event in the Olympics, and Dolph had to have kept himself in pretty good shape to keep up with this.  The match plays out like this.  Dolph brings the woodchipper from the movie Universal Soldier, in which he met his unfortunate end inside.  While fighting, Seagal gets his ridiculous ponytail stuck in it and gets sucked in.  He’s already proved that he can’t hold on too long.  He got sucked out of that plane in Executive Decision.  Do you think that He-Man couldn’t have held on?   Sylvester Stallone vs. Bruce Willis  Alright, that last match was way too long, so I won’t waste too much space with writing up the featherweight match of the first round.  Sure, both of these guys play tough guys in almost all of their movies, but Clint Eastwood showed that movie roles don’t amount to much in this tournament.  Sorry, but Bruce Willis has no chance.  He has no training in any fighting skill, and while he’s shown his toughness by walking across glass barefooted, Rocky could take a hell of a beating as well.  Stallone didn’t have any formal training either, but he did learn how to box a little bit in the Rocky movies.  His trainers even said that he was really pretty good at it… a natural!  Hell, he used those skills to beat Dolph Lundgren and Mr. T, both of whom are in this tournament.  While we’re speaking of movie roles, why don’t we talk about one.  Did you know that the Arnold Schwarzenegger was supposed to be the lead in Die Hard?  He turned it down.  The next choice was Stallone.  He also turned it down.  Lowly Bruce Willis was the third choice.  Granted, he was fantastic, but the THIRD choice?!?!?  I’ll say this match goes to the only man who has shown real toughness, by being voted the most likely to end up in the electric chair in high school.  Sly wins this one before anyone has time to sit down.   Bruce Lee vs. Jean-Claude Van Damme  I’ll be honest with you.  When I first sat down to analyze this fight, I figured it would be another blow out.  How will a spandex-wearing pretty boy beat out the man voted as the greatest martial artist of the 20th Century?  However, the Frenchman is not all that wimpy.  Like Lundgren, Van Damme won the European karate championship.  He won it in the middleweight division.  He then went on to try to win the US championships.  He lost.  However, he was very determined.  He later challenged his defeater to another match and beat him in less than two minutes.  This is oddly familiar to the plot from the Bruce Lee biography movie.  For those who haven’t seen it, go out and watch it!  Van Damme has also had some pretty good movie toughness.  Bloodsport and Kickboxer were hella tough!  Hell, Van Damme was even originally supposed to play the Predator in the movie… uh… Predator.  Arnold would have had his hands full if that would have been the case.  Unfortunately, Van Damme was fired from his job, probably due to his wild behavior, which has led to some DUI incidents.  Anyway, let’s look at how these guys are linked together.  Actually, they’re the first two of the three guys in this tournament that are part of what I want to call, the Norris Factor.  Yes, Chuck Norris is linked with a few of these fighters, which is why he was picked as a referee instead of a contestant.  Van Damme was Norris’ training partner.  I’d say that puts him at about the same level as Chucky.  However, Bruce Lee was Norris’ master, and he trained him in Jeet Kune Do, which is Lee’s own made-up style of fighting.  This fact alone sets Lee above Van Damme.  Lee used to face challenges from other movie martial artists all the time, which is how I’d imagine this fight would begin.  However, Lee never lost one of those challenges, and while Van Damme was busy doing one of his slow-motioned punches, the man who was so fast that the cameras couldn’t even catch his moves it going to be laying into him.   Lou Ferrigno vs. Arnold Schwarzenegger  Here’s the final match of the first round, and it’s got a twist to it as well.  Both Arnold and Lou are former body-builders.  However, if that’s going to be the only criteria, then Arnold wins.  While Ferrigno was the youngest person, at 21, to win the Mr. Universe competition and to follow up the next year as the only one to do it consecutively, Arnold won Mr. Olympia SEVEN TIMES!  He’s been called the greatest body-builder EVER, and called the most perfectly formed body in human history.  They both have been in tough movies as well.  While Arnold was beating up Van Damme’s replacement in Predator and scaring children in Terminator, Lou played the Incredible Hulk.  However, this is a fighting tournament, and while body-building and tough roles does mean you’re a beast, it doesn’t mean that you could beat up another beast.  So to determine the victor, I ask you, where are they now?  Well, Arnold is the governor of California.  He sits up in a plush office and practices the pronunciation of Culeefornia-, I mean California.  Lou on the other hand runs a personal trainer service, where he become another person to take advantage of the Norris Factor.  Yes, he’s Chuck Norris’ personal trainer.  At 50, he still benches 400 lbs, although he could do 560 lbs at 25, his prime.  So, let’s compare some recent pictures of the two.  Lou looks like  urlLink this , and Arnold looks like  urlLink this .  I guess all that makeup and black leather in Terminator 3 was covering up for something.  Arnold gets broken into several pieces in this fight, ala the T-1000 in Terminator 2.  He made the mistake of making Lou Ferrigno angry, and you wouldn’t like him when he’s angry.  Hasta la vista, baby!  The Tournament Will Return.  Coming soon: The Second Round.

						   It's shaping up to be an exciting weekend here at The Juice Box - football playoffs, a road trip,   The Sandman's Uber-Supreme Championship of Toughness   coming up soon (check Drewbacca2's IM for 1st round matchups), and today, another guest column, from Mom:  "In answer to that important 21st-century question "WWJD?" (What Would Jesus Drive?) the answer is clear: MY new car (and I hope I would be Christian enough to loan it to Him...). My new Toyota Prius gets 60 mpg, or so they tell me at the dealership where I bought it yesterday.   And no, that's not 60 miles per HOUR, but ... 60 miles per GALLON.  Of regular gas.  And hey, if He never got it into 4th gear, He'd need no gas at all, because the engine runs on a battery until it reaches 35 mphour.    And no, He wouldn't need to plug it in to recharge it, cuz that battery charges itself with kinetic (or is it potential??) energy.  Every time He used the brakes,  (like to let a baby squirrel cross the road) the friction (=energy) would recharge the battery. No, it's not an SUV:  this car is a ULEV, an Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle.  It practically makes the air cleaner when driving through a smoggy area.  Like downtown Houston.  It has five doors (one is the hatchback) and carries five passengers, so I'll be taking you fans down to Minute Maid Park ( that's The Juice Box, Mom )to see the Astros et al. on ONE gallon of gas, round trip.   Pretty miraculous, huh?  And if it keeps raining this weekend, I'll see how it drives on the water....."  You can see where Andy and I get our sense of humor from, I hope.  Ok, football predictions (maybe I can go 0-7!):  Carolina at Philly.  The Eagles managed a running game last week despite Brian Westbrook, thanks to Donovan McNabb, who finally started scrambling again.  He might find it tougher going against the Panthers, though, who have probably the best defensive line in football.  I don't think Philly scores much.  But it might be enough, because the Eagles have an excellent pass defense, and the Panthers may or may not have Stephen Davis.  Can Philly possibly lose two NFC Champhionship Games at home in a row?  You bet they can.   Panthers, 16-10 .  Indy at New England.  Indy's coming off a crazy game against the Chiefs, one in which their offense absolutely dominated.  But last time I checked, the Chiefs didn't punt either.  Indy's D might be picked apart by Tom Brady.  The Patriots...well, I don't like the Patriots.  They're not really an exciting team to watch.  They're kind of...bland.  They win close games, they play smart, blah blah.   Colts win (please), 27-23 .

						   Apparently some people (girls) who read this blog want to read about stuff other than sports.  As opposed as I am to the idea, I'm all about getting as many people (girls) to visit this site as I can, so what the heck.  Today's guest writer: Nicole Serago!   "Ok, so I’m one of those people that read this stuff because I have nothing better to do, even if half of it just looks like a bunch of numbers to me.  Every once in a while there is the lone sentence about something not baseball related and now that is what I am here to provide.  Don’t get me wrong, I like baseball (even if my lifetime baseball viewing experience is pretty limited to things that happen in the Pittsburgh area and one trip to Fenway – but then again, you tell me if you have been to an All Star Game or the world premiere of Angels in the Outfield) but I also think there are other things in life that are worthy of attention.    First priority: Friends.  And by that I mean the TV show (not that I don’t love all my actual friends, but that would be a gossip column) which as any person with half a brain knows is in its tenth and final season.  So I begin with last night’s episode.  To begin, I am ridiculously happy that the last season didn’t end up being the same year as college graduation because I don’t think I could have handled the trauma of both things ending.  See, the last season is a lot like senior year.  There’s a lot of moving on and saying goodbye (both in the show and for the actual cast).  While the majority of the episode was not new footage (meaning they actually all got paid the $1 million for about 5 minutes worth of show time this week), the writers are definitely setting up the last few episodes to be pretty emotional for the true fans.  I’ve always thought it would be neat to be able to rewatch special moments from the past like they do in TV flashbacks.  I got a new appreciation of an old clip that I had forgotten – no matter what the situation, the end of living with the same roommate for years is one of the hardest goodbyes.  So when the question “How can you leave this place?” is posed, the reality of it hits you.  The moral of the story:  Sometimes the place you’ve gotten used to being isn’t the only place you want to be.  And on the lighter side, a fun question from this episode: Which would you rather give up, food or sex?       Now as far as sports go…so the Super Bowl is coming up soon.  Better yet, right after that is the first episode of Survivor All-Stars.  You know what that means: another dose of Colby for the ladies in case that Schick Quattro commercial wasn’t doing the trick.  And as Ankita says “awesome we will have to watch unless it’s in conflict with friends”  See, someone knows what’s important."

						   Astros update:  According to today's  Chronicle , we're going to announce the signing of Orlando Palmeiro today.  (On a related note, Greg Norton, JT's pick for utility guy, signed with Detroit.)  First the good news: Palmeiro is an excellent fielder, he can play all three outfield spots, he bats left-handed, and he's got a career .357 OBP.  The bad news?  Six.  That's how many career home runs Palmeiro has in nearly 1800 at-bats.  That means if he gets 150 at-bats this year, we can expect him to hit half a home run.  He can't really steal bases, either - only a 57% mark for his career.  Finally, um, we have Jason Lane, and (also according to today's  Chronicle ) Hidalgo's staying with Houston (yes!), so why, exactly, do we need a 5th OF who is not any better (but more expensive) than Colin Porter?  I guess Palmeiro will also be used as a lefty pinch-hitter, but I think Colin Porter could do just as well.  I don't like this move much.  We still really need a backup IF, preferably one with some power that might actually make a pitcher nervous in late-game situations when we pitch-hit for Ausmus or the pitcher.  Someone like Travis Lee (28 years old, 807 OPS last year with 19 HR's).  In other news, I'm getting ready for a big weekend trip to College Station to visit friends.  This will rock because: 1) I'm driving up there with Barstool.  Road trips of any duration with Barstool are hella fun.  Hella fun.  2) We're going to watch football.  I like football, even though I don't know crap about it.  3) I'm probably gonna lose some money to JT in poker, which is always fun.  and 4) Did I mention Barstool?  Tomorrow I'll make my picks for the Colts-Pats and Panthers-Iggles, but I've gotta pick carefully and try to keep my winless streak alive.  Until then, e-mail me with news and I'll put it on here.    P.S.  JT showed me that I can actually pick up and move my keyboard around, so I'm typing this from my bed, which is awesome, and the best.  Thanks, JT!    Party on, playaz.

						   I'm going to take a one-day break from the world of sports and talk about...well, things other than sports.  I read a really great article from  The New Yorker  the other day about sport-utility vehicles (SUVs).  Quick summary: SUVs are unsafe, inefficient, and incredibly popular.  Why?  Because people believe that they are safer than an average car, despite every test and statistic indicating otherwise.  It kinda reminds me from a quote from  Sneakers  (my favorite movie), in which Ben Kingsley (bad guy) tells Robert Redford (good guy): "The most important thing...isn't reality.  It's the perception of reality."  SUVs are not safe - but they are perceived to be safe, and thus are selling like hot cakes.  Anyway, food for thought.    Oh yeah!  Andy's first newspaper article was about Cameran Eubanks, a cast member of the new  Real World  who is from Anderson, South Carolina, where Andy's interning for a couple/three months.  And...she's hot.  Really hot.  And she's got a cute southern accent.  And she likes sailing.  So...whatcha waiting for, Andy?  Get to it, buddy.  I'm finally starting to get ripping on some grad school apps, but I think I'm going to study statistics and break into the impossible-to-break-into world of professional sports.  Sorry, future students.  So we've got two cats at our house, a few next door, and a few neighborhood cats that just kind of wander by our house all the time.  Yesterday I went to pick up the mail and there were five cats just hanging out, really lazy, watching me walk to the mailbox.  Then they just kinda stopped watching me and went back to hanging out, because they were bored with me.  Therefore, cats are cooler than me (and you, too.)  So as you can see, I'm running low on material.  If you're reading this, you probably know me, so if you've got something to say, e-mail it to me and I'll run it.  Where else can you get that kind of free publicity, I ask you?    Keep it chill, yo.

						   Andy looks at the 2004 Astros through slightly-rose-colored glasses, predicts the lineup, playoffs, and suggests that Dan Miceli is poop.  I make occasional comments (in  bold )  "i love all your new posts, but you seem to be making a 180 degree  turnaround from the statistician field. Which is awesome. I've always  thought Bidge and Bags should stay with the Stros, even if it meant  keeping them around for longer than they were valued. I'm sure Billy  Beane and all his followers would have shipped off the old guys long  ago (or at least traded them in their primes), but you're exactly right  about those two having a HUGE effect that isn't reflected in their  stats.  They're team leaders, they draw a crowd, they create team identity,  they helped bring Pettitte and Rocket, and they're still DAMN GOOD. I say  Biggio goes .280-.350-.500  ( Biggio's slugging % the last three years are .455, .404, and .412 ) and swipes at least a dozen bases to reach 500. While I'm at it, Bagwell goes .300-.375-.600 ( Bagwell's slugging % the last three years are .568, .518, .524 )  and has another 100-rbi season. In fact, I bet Hidalgo finally pieces together two  consecutive monster seasons, but gets overshadowed by Berkman's huge comeback with 50 -- count-em -- homers ( he had 25 last year, although he did have 42 the year before ) and a 1.000 OPS. Kent goes for a .950 OPS, finally healthy ( I think this is pretty likely ).  Ensberg drops off a bit, but still impresses with an .850 OPS  ( I think that's very likely ). Ausmus uses his second half as a springboard to a .700 OPS season ( I hope so ), and Everett wins the Gold Glove while putting up a .750 OPS ( very possible ).  Oh yeah, and the Stros will be the first team in history with four 20  game-winners, and we go 150-12 (all 12 losses are Redding's, despite a  sub-3.00 ERA). And we don't lose a game in the playoffs.  ( I like it.  Seriously, we could win 100 games pretty easily. )  But seriously, might we shop Hidalgo to Baltimore? Who could we get? I  like Jay Gibbons, but not THAT much. The thing is, we don't need  anything that we could get in return for Hidalgo. Maybe a RF, but if we  do shop him, we'll have Lane. I say there's no way we get ridda him,  not after all these emotional signings. It'd leave a bitter aftertaste in  the collective mouth of Houston, and if (should my predictions somehow  miss the mark) our offense falters again, we'll miss his power.  ( If we do shop Hidalgo, I imagine we'd try to package Roberston with him and get prospects.  I also hope we don't - Lane has fewer than 100 AB's in the majors, and we would miss Hidalgo's patience, power, and arm.)   I was pondering our best possible line-up, rotation, bench and bullpen,  and a potential playoff schedule whilst at a school board (read: bored)  meeting in Starr, S.C. Methinks you will partake in imbibing me quaff  of  shit.  Lineup: 1. Biggio .280 - .350 - .500  ( probably closer to a .450 slugging ) 2. Berkman .300 - .450 - .550 3. Hidalgo .300 - .425 - .525  ( Hidalgo's never drawn more than 58 walks, so I don't see a 425 OBP ) 4. Bagwell .280 - .375 - .600  ( probably closer to .550 slugging ) 5. Kent .300 - .400 - .550 6. Ensberg .275 - .350 - .500 7. Ausmus .250 - .300 - .400  ( Ausmus will not slug .400 ) 8. Everett .275 - .325 - .425  Bench Vizcaino .250 - .300 - .400   Lane .280 - .350 - .500 Chavez .250 - .300 - .400 Porter .275 - .325 - .450   Rotation: Oswalt 2.50, 1.15, 250 K   Pettitte 3.00, 1.20, 180 K  ( higher ERA ) Clemens 4.00, 1.30, 200 K Miller 3.00, 1.25, 225 K  ( higher ERA, fewer K's ) Redding 3.50, 1.30, 150 K  Bullpen: Robertson 4.50, 1.50 Hernandez 3.50, 1.35 Duckworth 3.25, 1.25   Miceli 4.00, 1.30 Saarloos 4.25, 1.40   Stone 3.50, 1.20 Lidge 3.00, 1.15, 100K Dotel 2.00, 1.00, 100K  Playoffs:  LDS: Astros over Padres Phillies over Cubs  Angels over Boston  ( nooooo...)  K.C. over Yankees  ( yay!!!)   LCS: Astros over Phillies  ( hopefully we avoid Wagner as much as possible )  K.C. over Angels  ( I would love this ALCS )  WS: Astros over K.C.   You like? I like. I'm calling it now: K.C. in the playoffs. Anyway,  right now I got 13 pitchers, 12 batters, which I suppose isn't  realistic. I suppose they could send down Robertson or Saarloos. (Or  trade Robertson or Redding). But why on earth would you trade anything  for bench help? This, to me, seems dumb. Aren't bench players like  crappy relievers? They spend very little time actually playing. Why  would you pay anything for a guy who (one figures) might not even get  100 ABs. I say Viz is fine. even better yet are Lane and Porter.  Especially Lane. He shouldn't spend any more time at AAA, as he knows  -- as we know -- that he is ready to play in the majors. But it might do  him good to spend a season as a bench player. he could learn a lot, and  he wouldn't have the immediate pressure of playing full-time. The only  reason the bench plays a factor during a season is filling in for  injured players. And Lane would definitely be the first guy to fill in  should an OF or Bagwell go down, so he should get 300 ABs or so.  ( If Lane is the 4th OF and the backup 1B, he'll probably get around 200-250 AB's.  Orlando Merced, who filled a similar role last year, got 212.)   I like the bullpen, too. I don't know why. The only guy I don;t like is  Miceli, and that's because he is poop. We have Robertson, Hernandez, or  Duckworth could fill in for an ijnured pitcher, and I like all three. I  think Duckworth will really fit in well here. In fact, I can see him  becoming the first link in the Big Three, Vol. II. Think about it.  Duckworth, Lidge, Dotel. Unstoppable. That is, of course, unless Rocket  goes the distance. Which he has done ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN TIMES in  his career. But seriously, Duckworth will benefit from a change of  scenery, Saarloos will finally become the "thinking" pitcher we've all  hoped he could be (in the mold of Maddux), Robertson will struggle but  improve his stats, Hernandez won't know it, but he'll save his elbow  for the rest of his career while pitching well. And Stone will be money.  Amazingly, we'll avoid the no-lefties-in-the-bullpen problem that we  always manage to find ourselves in. Hernandez will be #1 threat against  Jenkins, Patterson, Edmonds, Dunn, etc. And we don't have to waste a  big  league spot on Gallo or Bland. Not a weak link there (except Miceli of  course).  Do me a favor and look up Oswalt's first 50 starts versus Prior's. I  bet they are eerily similar.   ( How about their combined first two seasons instead?    Oswalt: 54 starts, 374.2 IP, 341 H, 86 BB, 352 K's, 30 HR's, 2.91 ERA, 1.14 WHIP Prior: 49 starts, 327.3 IP, 281 H, 88 BB, 392 K's, 29 HR's, 2.75 ERA, 1.12 WHIP Prior's gets more K's, but otherwise pretty similar.  Damn, Prior has a lot of K's.)   Obviously Prior has the better upside, but I bet these two could start a tremendous rivalry. Just imagine if the Cubs traded for, say, Tom Glavine. Think about how close our two rotations  would be:  Oswalt :: Prior (dominant but quiet, fast-working pitchers) Edge: Cubs Clemens :: Wood (hard-nosed arrogant Texan assholes who throw at  people's heads) Edge: Cubs Pettitte :: Glavine (crafty lefty veterans with postseason success)  Edge: Astros Miller :: Zambrano (power pitchers who sometimes lack control,  physically and mentality) Edge: Astros Redding :: Clement (bearded, short, lanky, ugly: they even look alike!)  Edge: Astros  But after this series, we gotta gear up for the mighty Kansas City  Royals! Boo BYE!"

						   The trade is official: Roger Clemens, one year, ~ 5 million.  One thing that struck me during the Clemens press conference was that it was obvious that Pettitte, Biggio, and Bagwell are a huge reason that Clemens signed.  I've tried to write about this before, but here goes: are Biggio and Bagwell getting older?  Yes.  Are they overpaid?  Yes.  Is Biggio a good defensive CF?  No.  Might Bagwell's arm fall off if he throws a relay home?  Yes.  Does any of that matter?  NO.  Well, yes, it matters a little.  But is there any way we sign Pettitte or Clemens (or Kent last year) without having Biggio and Bagwell (maybe even Ausmus) on our team?  I doubt it.    Baseball isn't all about what you do on the field.  Biggio and Bagwell are class acts, well-liked, respected guys who play the game the way it was meant to be played.  I just used way too many cliches in the last sentence, but today I don't care.  Today we signed Roger Clemens, and you can thank Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell as much as you can thank Drayton McLane.

						   Well, thanks to the Packers defense allowing the Eagles to convert on 4th and 26, I went 0-4 this past weekend with my football playoff predictions.  This teaches me one important thing: I should never, ever, bet on sports games.  Ever.  All the games were pretty close, leading me to think that football (unlike basketball and baseball) really does have the competitive balance thing down pretty well.  Anyone think the Panthers and Packers would meet in the NFC Championship Game at the beginning of the year?  Anyone?  Well, I didn't.    The big Astros news today (press conference at 2pm) is that Houston has signed  Roger Clemens  to a one-year deal worth 5 million.  I've heard the 'Stros will try to let Clemens make most of his starts at home, in front of his family and friends.  This is, in my opinion, an excellent deal for the Astros: 1) Clemens will practically pay for himself.  He's a local, a first-ballot Hall of Famer, and probably the best pitcher in the modern (post-WWII) era.  The fans should come in droves to see him pitch.  2)  Clemens is, however, 41 years old.  Exercising the caution that the Astros apparently were unwilling to use with Brad Ausmus, signing older players to one-year deals is smart.  But Clemens isn't your run-of-the-mill 41 year old.  He's never missed significant time due to injury, he's in great shape, and he struck out 190 batters in 211.2 innings last year.  In fact, don't just take my word for it - go to his  urlLink career stats page  and look in awe.  Roger Clemens has been an amazingly good, amazingly durable pitcher for nearly as long as I've been alive.  I really can't believe the Astros will have 2/5 of the 2003 Yankees starting rotation in 2004.  It's insane.  Here are your 2004 Astros starting pitchers, with 2003 IP, ERA, and K's:  1.  Roy Oswalt  (127.2, 2.97, 108) 2.  Roger Clemens  (211.2, 3.91, 190) 3.  Andy Pettitte  (208.1, 4.02, 180) 4.  Wade Miller  (187.1, 4.13, 161) 5.  Tim Redding  (176, 3.68, 116)  That rotation scares me.  It should scare any non-Astro hitter in the National League.  That is an absolutely dominant, better than the Cubs, better than the Red Sox, better than the A's starting rotation.  The bad news?  Ummmm...sorry, Carlos Hernandez, Brandon Duckworth, and Jeriome Roberston - have a seat in the bullpen or AAA, 'cause we just signed the best pitcher of the last thirty years.  If the Astros can get a decent bench soon (which could be easily accomplished by siging a backup IF and a backup C), they may well run away with the National League next year.  It's a good day to be an Astros fan.

						   Damn.  So, a day later, but no wiser, I am currently 0-3 in my football playoff picks, while JT is a cool 3-0.  I am ashamed.  I could say something like "Well, all the games were close, and if Mike Martz wasn't incredibly bad at clock management and if Drew Bennett makes that %@%@ catch and if the Chiefs defense could not be painfully crappy, then....."  But NO.   No excuses.  I guess that's why I think of this blog as a baseball blog, first and foremost: because I should write about what I know, and I clearly know NOTHING about football.  Right, JT?  Jt:  Damn straight.  You will bow to me and acknowledge my football superiority.  I own you in baseball too.  Also, it's too bad I'm not the GM of the Astros because we'd have Greg Norton instead of John Valentin as our new bench player.  Someday!  As for now, I will go for the quadruple...4-0 in my predictions...every one opposite of you and every one working out for me so far.  I own!  Barstool:  The only reason I'm 2 and 1 is because I had a sympathetic pick for the Titans.  So I wanna see McNair move on....oh well.  I'll take the loss.  I know nothing of baseball, but I know far more than Jack about football....even though I've only been following the game for three years.  Jack picked Kansas City.....KANSAS CITY against the Colts.....I swear, he smokes crack.  He's doing lines right now.  I wish he'd put out the light in his bong...it's smokin' up the joint.  I'm going to go play tennis now...but look for Green Bay to beat the Eagles tonight.  J.T. says otherwise.  Jack picked the Pack also...which is why they'll probably lose now.  He's jinxed everyone so far.  boo BYE!  Well, that's the guest column for today.  See what my friends are like?  Now you probably understand why I have no self-esteem.  Well, gotta go.  Weekend's a-wastin'.

						   I've got a big day planned (helping Dad take down the Xmas lights, watching 6 hours or so of football, and playing some tennis), so let's get right to it.  1.  The Mets are reportedly close to signing Vladimir Guerrero to a 3 year, ~40 million dollar deal.  First of all, let me say: HOLY CRAP.   That would be an unbelievably good deal for any team, much less one with the payroll that the Mets have.  If they do sign Guerrero, suddenly their OF is Cliff Floyd, Mike Cameron, Vladi.  I am damn glad the Astros aren't in the NL East, and I've got a hunch that is going to be an absolutely brutal division next year.  2.  Some smart-ass vet school kid suggested to me that the Astros go after Greg Norton.  Here are Norton's batting splits against RHP (he really can't hit left handed pitching very well) over the last 3 years:  .254 / .324 / .503 with 26 HR's and 95 RBI's...in 461 at-bats!  Yeah, that is slightly inflated by playing half his games at Planet Coors, but:  1) Norton can play any infield position  2) He's left-handed  3) He's one of the best pinch-hitters in baseball.  Greg Norton is not a great baseball player.  But the guy whose at-bats he'd probably be taking, Jose Vizcaino, is significantly worse in every way.  Viz's OPS the last 3 years with the Astros:  666, 739, 646.  We need a guy like Greg Norton badly.  Let's get him.  He can't be that expensive.  Well, I'm off.  Hope everyone has a great weekend.

						   "I feel found."  That's a quote from  House of Sand and Fog , a really good, thoughtful (kinda American Beauty + My Life as a House / 2) movie.  And it's got Ben Kingsley, one of the top ten greatest living actors.  So go see it.  Jennifer Connelly provides the eye candy.  Anyway, I thought I'd talk about football today.  It's the quarterfinals of "The Tournament", as everyone seems to be calling the NFL playoffs (although in my opinion, March Madness is the  real  Tournament.)  I'll go through each game, throw some stats at you, and give you my opinion.  1.  Carolina at St. Louis.  Carolina's coming off a complete thrashing of the Cowboys, one in which they racked up 380 yards (most of that in their blowout 1st half), had 0 turnovers, 0 penalties, and basically kicked the @%^$% out of Dallas.  On the other hand, Marc Bulger has never started and lost a game at home, and the Rams as a whole have only lost 4 games at home over the last 3 years.  Marshall Faulk is rested and should get at least 25 touches.  I say the Rams keep that gaudy home record intact.   St. Louis , 31-14.  2.  Tennessee at New England.  The Titans are coming off an emotional win at Baltimore, one in which 44-year old Gary Anderson nailed a 46-yard field goal (by a cool half a yard) as time expired.  Steve McNair is having a great year, although his 1st half was much better, but the real unsung hero of this team is their defense, which has stopped the run and pressured the quarterback all year.  The Patriots are undefeated at home, have allowed the fewest points in the NFL, and have the constantly underrated Tom Brady at the helm.  Too bad they're going to lose tomorrow.   Tennessee , 17-13.  3.  Indy at K.C.  I'm still not that impressed with the Colts.  The only good team they've beaten all year is the Titans.  However, they are 7-1 on the road, and Kansas City isn't playing that well...or are they?  Yeah, they had bad losses to Denver and Minnesota (giving up 45 points in both games) down the stretch, but they've still got Priest Holmes, and they're undefeated at home (who isn't, by the way?)   K.C.  in a shootout, 38-34.  4.  Green Bay at Philly.  Green Bay's got Brett Favre, fumblin' stumblin' rumblin' Ahman Green, and....well, that's about it.  Philly has Donovan McNabb but no Brian Westbrook, great pass D, but no run D.  They gave up 192 yards to Green earlier this year, and I don't think they can stop him this time either.   Green Bay  wins it, 24-14.  Well, that's it.  I'm gonna go outside for a while.  Oh yeah - my brother's taking over  urlLink AIM  (1st 3 stories only).  Give 'em hell, bro.  Later.

						   It's a rainy January day here in Houston, when a young man's fancy turns to...Brad Ausmus??  Brad Ausmus's re-signing with the Astros (1 mil '04, 3 mil '05) has been a hotly debated topic in the past month or so.  I'd like to take an in-depth look at what he brings to the Astros.  First of all, and there's no getting around this, Ausmus was an offensive sinkhole last year:  He posted a .229 / .303 / .291 line in 450 at-bats last year.    *Pause*.  Those numbers are good for a 594 OPS, a .209 GPA (courtesy of  urlLink Aaron Gleeman ), and a .209 EQA (courtesy of  urlLink Baseball Prospectus )  Regardless of the metric used, Ausmus was awful at the plate last year.  However, (and this better be a big however, when you're slugging .291) he is still excellent defensively.  I don't think anyone would argue that he saved the Astros runs last year with his defense.  But how, exactly, do you measure this?    1.  You stop the running game.  Ausmus threw out 37 of 105 runners this season, a 35% caught-stealing rate.  This is down from his best years (2000, 2001) where his CS% was around 50%, but it's still fairly good.  How good?  Other catchers and their CS% in 2003:  Bengie Molina  44% Toby Hall  43% Charles Johnson  42% Paul LoDuca  41% Damian Miller  39% Brandon Inge (Ausmus's successor in Detroit)  36% Brad Ausmus  35% Ivan Rodriguez  33% Ramon Hernandez  33% ...etc.  Anyway, you get the idea.  Ausmus was slightly-above league average in CS%.  2.  You call a good game.  This one's almost impossible to measure.  Yes, you can look at CERA (Catcher's ERA), but Ausmus (whose CERA was 3.68) caught a disproportionate number of innings by Oswalt / Lidge / Dotel / Wagner, while rarely catching Jeriome Roberston, for example.  What can't be argued is that Astros pitchers and pitching coach Burt Hooton have universally praised Ausmus for handling the pitchers well.  One thing that can't be measured by good ol' statistics is the confidence that Astros pitchers have to throw pitches that other catchers might not be able to handle.  Lidge's slider comes to mind.  Maybe that doesn't make much of a difference, but maybe it does.  3.  Baseball Prospectus 2001 said that the Astros signing Brad Ausmus was a hidden cost of having Jeff Bagwell on your team.  I don't think there's any doubt that Bagwell and Biggio like playing with Ausmus.  In addition, having a respected guy like Brad Ausmus behind the plate surely helped the Astros land Andy Pettitte.  Again, neither of these factors can be measured, but they should both be mentioned.  4.  Finally, it's not like the Astros have Mike Piazza sitting on the bench.  John Buck, catching prospect of the future, has yet to have a full year at AAA.  Raul Chavez has a career 658 OPS.  There aren't significantly better options in-house; we could make a trade for a catcher, but the Astros seem reluctant to do so.  In the end, despite Ausmus having reached near-useless levels at the plate (he did post a 344 OBP in the 2nd half last year), I think he's worth retaining.  He's still a defensive asset, he's well-liked, and he's not costing us that much.  I do wish we had only signed him for one year with a club option for the 2nd, though: I think John Buck should be ready next year.  Well, that's it for now.  Hopefully Ausmus can put up something like a 240 / 320 / 330 line this year, rebounding to his 2002 level.  I think we'd all take that.  In the meantime, think of him as a hidden cost of having Bagwell / Biggio / Pettitte - when you think of him that way, it's not that big of a cost to pay.  Plus, as my Mom says, 'He's so cute.'  Tomorrow:  Football playoff preview!

Ray Kerby has done a phenomenal job with this site, and it is undoubtedly the best place on the 'Net to interact with fellow Astros fans.

						   How's it going?  I'm Jack Wade, pleased to meet you.  I'm a huge Houston Astros fan, but (truth be told) an even bigger fan of baseball in general.  I wasn't that keen on it for a while, but I was a math major in college, and I got into statistics which led to a baseball stats project which led to Bill James and Rob Neyer and Baseball Prospectus and so on and so forth etc. etc.  I do occasionally think non-baseball thoughts, so I reserve the right to post about whatever's on my mind.

						   I added a few links at the bottom of the page.  A short description of each:  Baseball Primer - The Grand Central Junction of baseball information on the web.  Their 'Clutch Hits' message board is fantastic, although I'm most impressed by their discussion that's not related to baseball at all.    Baseball Prospectus - Most of their content is subscription-based now, but some is still free.  I'm not a member yet, but probably will be soon.  They publish their annual Baseball Prospectus book every February or March; I've got every one since 1999.   Aaron's Baseball Blog - Aaron's a real inspiration to me - he really knows his stuff, he's a huge Twins fan (so is my Dad), he goes to U of Minn (my brother goes to Northwestern), and he's only 21!  (I'm 22.)  He's got new posts all the time, and they're always informative, funny, and lucid.  Stop by a lot.  U.S.S. Mariner - I guess the Mariners are probably my favorite team in the AL, because I *almost* got an internship with them.  Well, maybe not, but I still like them.  These guys know more about the Mariners than anyone, including (especially) the new GM, Bill Bavasi.  This website is a bit sadder and a lot more sarcastic than it used to be, but I still visit all the time.  Ok, enough for now.  Oh yeah,   Contact Me - tell me what you think.

						   There is a very interesting post on AstrosDaily about the possibility of trading Jeriome Robertson to the Baltimore Orioles for middle infielder Brian Roberts.  The Orioles would almost certainly do this deal because they've got Jerry Hairston, Jr. blocking Roberts at 2B and newly signed Miguel Tejada at SS.  I kind of like this deal, and here's the long, stat-heavy expanation:  Roberts is a hell of a lot better than Jose Vizcaino and Eric Bruntlett.  Ok, so maybe trading a young pitcher who just won 15 games for a backup middle infielder with a career high 704 OPS sounds a little weird:  The Good  1.  Roberts is 26.  He's going to get better.  2.  He has an excellent career SB% - over 80%.  He would immediately become the Astros best pinch runner (not saying that much)  3.  He's an above average fielder.  He had a Range Factor of 5.08 at 2B last year, compared to 4.94 for the league, and a fielding percentage of .987, compared to .982  4.  He draws a few walks.  46 out of 460 ABs last year.  5.  He hits righties fairly well - 720 OPS against them last year.  The Bad  1.  He has very little power.  2.  (The Main Reason)  We might be able to get more for Robertson.  A good prospect or two (from Milwaukee, Tampa Bay, the Rockies, the Rangers...) would be great.  All in all, if Gerry Hunsicker can't find much else for Robertson, he might want to do this deal - Roberts isn't going to set the world on fire, but anything that'll get Jose Vizcaino off the team next year has my approval.

						   The I-can't-believe-they-were-All-Stars team:  C Ramon Hernandez 1B Dmitri Young 2B Luis Castillo 3B Troy Glaus SS Rafael Furcal OF Hideki Matsui OF Rondell White OF Carl Everett DH Jason Varitek  SP Roger Clemens SP C.C. Sabathia SP Shawn Chacon  RP Lance Carter RP Mike MacDougal RP Armando Benitez  And the All-Star MVP:  RP Mike Williams (with an ERA over 6.00)  These guys don't even make a good fantasy team.   I also like that Atlanta and St. Louis accounted for 6 of the NL's 8 starting position players.

						   Pop quiz, hotshot.  Jack's favorite place in Amsterdam was:  A)  The Red Light District B)  The Netherlands House of Cheese C)  Grey Area, a local 'coffeeshop'  If you answered B, you are damn right!  Ok, which sounds better to you:  Having scantily dressed....um....women of the night...beckon provocatively at you, unravel the Stoner Mysteries of the Universe, or biting into a huge hunk of goat cheese with herbs?  I mean, COME ON MAAAAN.  Barstool knows what I'm talking 'bout.  Plus the cheese place was in this awesome little town called Zaanke Schans, like a twenty minute train ride outside big ol' Amsterdam, so it was really nice to get away for a bit.  Plus there were sheep and windmills.  Ok, new baseball idea: it's commonly accepted that a starting pitcher who normally throws 90 mph, if converted to a reliever, could throw 93-95 mph by 'letting it all hang out'.  So if this is true for relief pitchers, might it also be true for pinch hitters?  That is to say, if a guy knows he's not going to get many AB's, does he really GO FOR IT when he doesn't get that many AB's?  It's an interesting idea; you could check it by comparing a guy's OPS as a pinch-hitter vs. his OPS as a regular.  Food for thought....  Using my advanced math skills, I realized I still have approximately 16 places I had planned on visiting  (Ready?  Berlin Prague Budapest Munich Vienna Bern Venice Florence Rome Athens Barcelona Madrid Bordeaux Paris Dublin London) and about 35 days in which to do it.  So I gotta cut down...2 days per place is too rough a pace to keep up.  I don't know what to cut out, though.  More approximations: I finished my first disposable camera already!  That's like 30 pictures gone in 10 days.  And they're all of cheesy landscape/touristy stuff, too...I'm still kind of embarrassed to ask people to take pictures of me doing wild things.

						   Yeah. It's snowing in South Carolina too. Which must be about 3000 miles south of Amsterdam. Weird.  Anyway, I have to say I am now officially scared of the Cubs. Let's just forget about the Astros for a minute. Compare the 2003 Cubs with their 2004 roster. They have improved in numerous areas (bullpen, 1B, rotation) and will have improved starters at 3B and CF for the entire year. Plus the 6-fingered freak is not haunting them.  True, the Cubs got "lucky" last year, meaning their run differential was not as impressive as the Astros'. But this means nothing. They still won more games than we did, and their club is looking even more impressive this year. If Clement and Zambrano can dominate again, we have some trouble.   I think whichever team can stay healthier will win the division. Both teams have aging stars, and both teams are relying heavily on their position players. Houston has a slight advantage in terms of bench strength and spot starters, but either team will suffer greatly if any pitcher or position player goes down.  Houston cannot afford another bad wrist from Kent or another groin pull from Oswalt. At the same time, the Cubs are relying on Corey Patterson's complete recovery from knee surgery, which is asking a lot.

						   Well, no one else is writing much (Andy?  Barstool?), so I better keep it up.  There's another great article at Baseball Prospectus about the Astros, although it's subscribers only, but I'll give you the scoop:  They don't like Craig Biggio or Brad Ausmus.  Surprise, surprise, huh?    They go through the entire offense in terms of VORP (Value Over Replacement Player), and Biggio and Everett are slightly positive, Ausmus slightly negative, and everyone else pretty solid.  They also project a massive rebound year for Berkman and for Hidalgo to regress a bit, both of which I basically agree with.    Ok, but here's the thing about Biggio.  They project him at .267 / .344 / .401....which is NOT that bad.  They also have him at below-average defensively, which I also agree with....but he's not insanely bad, like Bernie Williams.    They project Lane at .275 / .340 / .472, which I think is also pretty accurate.    Anything surprise you there?  Biggio has a higher projected OBP than Lane!  Yeah, yeah, Lane is younger, has more power, is better defensively....  But OBP is still the most important stat in baseball, and if Biggio's is projected to be higher, it's not an absolute tragedy that he's starting over Lane.  Hopefully Lane will still get plenty of AB's (backing up Biggio, filling in for Berkman against LHP, backing up Bagwell, first PH option), so it's not a question of Biggio-or-Lane.  Anyway, I'm gonna get a little more of Amsterdam in before I leave for Berlin tomorrow.  Bye!

						   It's snowing in Amsterdam, which means I've got a little free time at the computer, so get ready for a nice big post.  First, I think JT's on the right track about Tyler Houston.  He's got some pop, a career 724 OPS against righties, can play 3rd and back up Ensberg, and is much better than Viz.  I wish he drew more walks, but what the hell, we're kind of desperate.  I say DO IT.  And you gotta love the PR from having a last name of Houston.  Second, there have been some really good articles (most of them subscription-based, unfortunately) about the Top 50 prospects (anyone can see the final list, actually) at  urlLink BPro .  The good news is that it's entertaining to read - the bad news is 0 - the number of Astros on the list.  NONE!  Lane is too old to be a prospect anymore, and the only other ones that could be considered are Burke and Bucholz, I guess.  That's not a great sign for the organization - we need some good drafts/trades in the next few years.  Hey, it stopped snowing!  So anyway, it's a bit misleading that everyone thinks of Amsterdam as the World Wide Weed Capital, with one Smokey McPot as the mayor, 'cause it's not true.  Well, maybe a little, but there's a lot more, tons of classic old buildings and canals and nice people who all speak English and awesome beer and clean beds.  If it would stop snowing (it started again) I'm a-gonna rent a bike and rip up - there are bike lanes all over the place.  I'll probably be here for a coupla days, and then on to Berlin.    That's it for now.

						   Alright...so I've got what needs to be the Astros next offseason pickup....  Tyler Houston!  The Yankees just released Houston...they had no use for him now that they've convinced the greatest SS in the game to play 3rd for them.  He's a lefty bat who can back up Ensberg if needed, so that Viz isn't given the at-bats that he doesn't deserve.  Houston's also got a little pop.  He can also be an emergency catcher since he used to play there too.  AND his name is H-O-U-S-T-O-N...I mean, c'mon it's only fitting.  What's not to love...I say DO IT!

						   I'm in Brussels, the capital of Belgium, and so far it has been a night-and-day kind of city.  Night: I get in from a delayed six-hour journey from London, am immediately disoriented, wander around aimlessly for two hours, an ATM eats my debit card for a minute before finally spitting it back out, then I finally ask someone for help, and find the hostel in the next ten minutes, at which point I grab a quick beer and go straight to bed after waking up my other five roommates.  Day: I walk through the entire city, stopping only to maul a Belgian waffle dipped in chocolate.  I took about ten pictures, it was awesome weather, I found this great internet cafe...everything's perfect.  What a difference a day makes.  Tomorrow I'll be heading to Amsterdam sometime - I've got a hostel lined up.  I'll probably check out the city the first day and then rent a bike and cruise around the countryside - supposedly there is a lot to see outside of the main city.  Can't wait!  But until then, I gotta relax for a while.    On a side note, Astros fans,  urlLink check this out .  How awesome is that??  OSWALT STARTS OPENING DAY.  I adore our rotation: Oswalt, Pettitte, Clemens, Miller, Redding.  That is *spectacular*.  Bring it, Cubbies.  See ya.

						   My time in London is coming to an end - I booked a bus/ferry/bus combo thing to Brussels, Belgium, home of Tintin (most famous comic book hero in Europe), Mannekin Pis (a statue of an impudent little boy peeing - think Calvin and Hobbes), and Van Gogh.  London's been a lotta fun, but it's a little too BIG.  I mean, it's huge.  There are people and buses and dogs and parks and monuments and museums and libraries and it's all EVERYWHERE.  Man, my feet still hurt just thinking about it.  But the people are friendly, the beer is great, and the fish and chips are salty and hot, so all in all it was pretty good.  I gotta move on, though, lots more to see and only 5.5 weeks to do it in!  The next time you hear from me it'll be in Belgium.  Until then, au revoir.  P.S.  Maddux to the Cubs.  Man.  I remember watching Maddux pitch for the Cubs.....over ten years ago!!  Man, those were the days....Shawon Dunston, Ryan Sandberg, Mark Grace, Andre Dawson, and Greg Maddux.  Andy knows where I'm coming from.  ANd now he's back in Chicago.  Too bad the Astros are still better bwahahahahaha.  Later!

						   Baseball: How good is Jeff Bagwell? Only 10 players in baseball hit more homeruns than he did last year. And he was one of only 29 major leaguers to reach 100 RBI. But he also posted his first sub-.900 OPS since 1995 (his OPS has declined in each of the last 5 years). He'll turn 36 in May and, as Jack says, his right arm may fall off at any moment. He is no longer a premier slugger (his OPS wasn't in the top 40) but he can still produce. It all depends on the size of his goatee.  Non-baseball: I'm still undecided as to whom I like for the Democratic candidacy. Here's the breakdown:   John Kerry plays guitar. Apparently he was in a rock band back in the 70s. 5 points.   John Edwards' daughter is hotter than either of Kerry's daughters. 10 points.   Kerry is a HUGE Red Sox fan, and still hasn't forgiven Grady Little for leaving Pedro in to pitch the 8th inning. 50 points. Kerry wins.

						   So I've been reading about the ARod trade and I've been discussing it with some friends.  Turns out, after all is said and done, that the Rangers will end up paying ARod $140 million for 3 years of service.  Meanwhile, the Yankees will only be paying him $110 million for 7 years...which is about $15.7 million/year.  How exactly did the Rangers think this was a good deal again?!?!  This trade just further increases my hatred of the Yankees, and yet another one of my favorite players becomes less liked because he has joined them (the first was Giambi).    So the true question is...if the Yankees are only having to pay ARod about $16 million/year, why the hell didn't the Astros make a run for him?  I mean, trade the Rangers Hidalgo and Redding (or whomever they want for that matter).  I mean lets face it...the Rangers got a good offensive player (but hardly a stellar defensive player) in Soriano, but they still have one of the most pathetic starting rotations in baseball.  I would venture to say that Redding would be their #2 starter this year.  Certainly with all our pitching depth, we could have helped them out there.  We'd throw in Hidalgo to help us out financially this year, and the Rangers can not resign him and get their payroll flexibility.  And the best part about this trade....we could actually keep the best SS in baseball at the SS position.    That is all for now.

						   C'mon, guys, nothing new posted yet?  Anyway, I'm here in London, arrived at 6:15 am here, took a train to central London, and finally found the hostel after wandering around for 4 hours or so with my big-ass backpack.  Good exercise, though, and I managed to stumble across Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, and Royal Albert Hall.  Unfortunately, it's overcast and drizzling, but I guess that's to be expected.  Oh, and I watched Matrix: Revolutions TWICE on the flight over, and I still don't like it.  Start writing crap, you lazy bitches, Jack

						   So I'm watching ESPN and all of a sudden a harmless little message scrolls across the bottom of the screen: Alex Rodriguez to the Yankees for Alfonso Soriano and a PTBNL (player to be named later).  Wow.  I mean, WOW.  The Red Sox had tried to add ARod earlier this offseason, but it fell through.  So the Yankees wait a while, pick up Kenny Lofton, Kevin Brown, Gary Sheffield, Javier Vazquez (ho hum).....and then add the best all-around player in the game, an inner-circle Hall of Famer, and probably the best shortstop of all time, who just happens to be 28 years old.  Ok.  First, the good news if you're not a Yankees fan:  1)  Apparently, the Yankees are going to move Arod (an excellent defensive shortstop and Gold Glove winner) to 3B, and keep Derek Jeter (a terrible defensive shortstop who does, however, have a good arm) at SS.    2)  They're trading away their only remaining good YOUNG player in Soriano.  Yes, Soriano's overrated - he doesn't control the strike zone well, he's only average defensively, and he's too aggressive on the basepaths.  But so was Sammy Sosa, and Soriano is only 25, and he's the type of player that's likely to age well.  Now: who do the Yankees put at 2nd?  Miguel Cairo??  That immediately takes away some of the gain from the ARod deal.  But seriously.  Forget all the stats and defense and everything on the field for a second.  The Yankees just traded for the best, most marketable player in the game................at a position where they already pay their team captain 16 million a year!!!  What the HELL is going on??  Seriously, this is ridiculous.    I understand it from the Rangers point of view, though.  Yes, it's ARod.  But they're going to save tons of money, Soriano is not a free agent for two or three more years, and ARod has been wanting to play in a national market for a long time.  Well, here ya go, Alex.  Have fun.  Damn, I hate the Yankees.  If one team doesn't play by the same rules as everyone else, I think it's time to change the rules.

						   One of the hot topics that has been dominating talk at a few of the baseball message boards that I visit is this:  Right-handed batters have a fairly consistent platoon advantage against left-handed pitchers.  On average, righties have an OPS that is 8% higher against left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers.  Here's the thing, though:  At the major-league level, no matter who the right-handed batter is, and no matter what they've done in the past against left-handed pitchers, the odds are that they will remain approximately 8% better against lefties than righties.    Why does this matter?  Well, for one, some batters have a reputation for being "lefty-mashers" - guys that just kill left handed pitching.  Frank Thomas, Reggie Sanders, Brian Jordan, Phil Nevin, etc. all have much higher career OPS against lefties than righties (more than 8% higher, that is.)  So why is the smart money on betting that everyone will do equally better?    Well, a few things.  Sample size.  The average right-handed batter only gets about 100-150 AB's a year against lefties - some a lot less than that.  That's not a whole lot, really.  You're going to get a lot of variance.  There are also a TON of right-handed batters in baseball.  Every year, a few will do much better than normal against lefties, and a few will do much worse than normal.  But you have to think of these as outliers - on either end of an imaginary Bell Curve.  Even though every year there are consistent outliers - guys that are always on one end or the other of the curve - this, too, is not completely unexpected.  Other researchers have crunched the numbers, and it's right.  It works.    So, what does it mean?  Basically, lefty-mashers don't really exist.  It's a myth, like clutch hitting, Derek Jeter's defense, and eating too many breadsticks at Fazoli's.  And that is all.

						   I recently realized that, well, this is my blog.  So I can write about anything I want.  And you have to read it.  Or leave.  Oh, and I can delete posts, too.  Andy's  Lonesome Dove  book review?  Gone.  But seriously, even though I love baseball, I don't have to write about it.  I mean, yeah,  I'm still going to .  No worries there.  But every now and then I'm gonna journal it up and there's nothing you can do about it.  So there.  So anyway my thought for the day is why don't we do the things we should do?  You know what I mean.  Why don't you get up in the morning and be productive?  Why do you have cheesecake for breakfast?  Why don't you call your parents and tell them you love them?  Why don't you sleep eight hours a day, exercise regularly, never drink alcohol, and go to church every Sunday?  Well, if you're anything like me...you're not entirely sure why.  In the long term, I know that I probably should do all of those things.  But I don't.  I don't think of myself as an instant-gratification sort of guy, although maybe I am.  Give me a choice between starting a new book or watching TV, and I'll usually choose TV, even though I don't even really like TV that much.  It's just so much effort starting a new book.  (Sidenote: I will, however, re-read  Dune , even if I've read it three times and I should be doing other things.)  That's the key, isn't it?  Effort.  Time.  Who's got the time to do anything these days?  Rush, rush, rush!  Well, I've probably got more free time than anyone reading this blog, and I still don't get nearly as much done as I should.  See, here's the thing.  The other day I'm waiting for Mark at a restaurant (we'll call it  Sweet Tomatoes , because it was) and a lady who is standing there with me says (out of the blue) "Did you know the average American spends 9 hours a year waiting at red lights?"  And of course I respond with a shake of the head and say "Wow" or something like that.  But, um...that's not that much time.  16 'awake' hours *365 days = 3653 hours.  So ya gotta do something with all that time.  But, if you're like me, not nearly as much as you should.  Resolution: Maybe I can change, though.  A little bit at a time.

						   Wow, it's been a while since I posted on my own blog.  It's good to know that there will be plenty of interesting posts by Andy, JT and Jason while I'm gone, though.  But before I leave, I thought I'd weigh in on the road trip issue.  The two road trips that I took with Andy were amazing.  However, I think that part of what made them so amazing is the fact that they were so out-of-the-ordinary, so different from everyday life.  So I understand why Jason wants to work now - because he knows he'll appreciate it more when he's got the time and money to do so.  But I know how Andy feels too, 'cause I've been out there with him, and there's nothing else like it - you just pack up and GO.  I'm going on a road trip of my own on Monday, and I'll try to post an occasional message telling you how it is.  One thing's for sure - it'll be a little different without Andy sleeping in the passenger seat.

						   Ya know…I read Andy’s article about road trips and I wondered to myself, “Barstool, why don’t YOU quit school and go on road trips?”  I thought about it for a while, first looking at the positive aspects of quitting school and going on road trips.  If I quit school I wouldn’t have any more homework to do, there would be no tests, no more books to read, no more projects, and (in my case since I commute) no more commuting.  I could see all of those places I’ve never seen before and meet all sorts of interesting people all along the expansive highway system of this great country.  I know for a FACT that I would have such a wonderful time….  …but then reality hits…  A single lesson comes back to haunt me whenever I think of going on such excursions.  I felt the same way people like Andy do back in my first two years of college.  Entering college, I vowed to study and do my best.  I was an electrical engineering major at Texas A&M University in Galveston….I was to spend a year there and then move to the main campus in College Station.  My first semester wasn’t that tough and I ended up with a 2.7 GPA (which I wasn’t THAT happy with but I would take it).  The second semester rolled around and I started thinking about my college career and which major I should REALLY be in.  Believe it or not, I had actually wanted to major in some kind of art.  Ever since I was 4 I had been able to draw rather well according to other people.  All through high school I was fed incessant suggestions to enter the art field.  Those thoughts started creeping back and I lost all interest in my major.  Why should I major in something I’m not crazy about?  Why should I spend all of my time studying physics, math, etc. when I could be drawing and having fun?  I went on several road trips that semester…and I also ended up with several bad grades in my classes.  I was forced to take classes at a community college and work my way back to A&M College Station, which I did.  But again, I went through that cycle (that and I really didn’t like living there) and wound up with terrible grades and academic probation.  Here’s where I owe my family big time.  After such a terrible semester they took me back and pounded into my head one of the most valuable lessons I’ve ever learned.  You work hard to earn your free time.  I site my grandfather, a man that I have respected and admired all of my life.  He grew up in a tiny house in Sour Lake, TX with his two brothers and two sisters (I think that’s the right number) during the Great Depression.  He and his brothers were drafted into the army for World War 2 but he never saw combat since he was color blind.  Instead he was assigned to assist in research on prosthetic limbs although he almost got assigned to something called the Manhattan Project (whatever that was, right?).  After the war was over he attended the University of Texas and got a mechanical engineering degree.  I asked him one time why he chose that degree and he changed my perspective entirely by saying six words…  “So I could get a job.”  He later went on to do grunt work in the oil industry, work his butt off to climb the ladder of success, and become one of the top dogs in the company.  Later he started our family company that’s still going strong today.  All the while he was able to travel and experience life.  What was the difference between doing it then and doing it when he was younger?  Traveling in class, comfort, and spending all of his time enjoying his travels and not having a worry in the world.  That’s what I realized that summer after my horrible semester at A&M.  I need to get a job, work hard, make money, and then I’ll have the rest of my life to do all of the things I want to do.  Drawing?  I can do that while I work if I’m serious enough about it.  Road trips?  Three words….paid vacation time.  True, I might miss out on some things that I may only be able to do right here and now.  But look at it this way, when I’m older, wiser, and RICHER I think the things I actually do get to experience will be experienced better than I could have possibly experienced them when I was younger.  I think about the future NOW so I’m sure to enjoy it LATER.  Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got a lot of work to do.  Barstool

						   Hi, I'm Barstool, and two weeks ago I was asked to submit entries into this blog.  I rejected the offer.  However, I have been approached repeatedly since that time with the same request and have finally given in to the annoying (yet ego-inflating) inquiries as to whether or not I would write articles.  This is primarily an outlet of baseball knowledge and analysis but since I know NOTHING of baseball I will write about other topics....such as buffalo wings!  Yes, buffalo wings...bad for the body but good for the soul!  Stay tuned to read what I have to say.  Barstool the Incredible

						   Hey all,  I'm JT and I will be posting from time to time while Jack is on one of his many excursions.  The plan is to stick to what I know...which is limited to most sports, especially baseball, and poker.  Keep an eye out for my stuff later on.  I probably won't have the in-depth statistics that Jack does, but I usually have some good opinions and insights.  Later.

						   Hi everyone. Jack's little bro here. Nice to meetcha.   I got a letter from Sweet Madre the other day containing an article about the two California dudes who created Road Trip Nation urlLink  , a documentary-slash-reality show-slash-group interview-slash-book. But really it's more of a cult following. Basically these two guys got sick and tired of studying all day to become doctors or accountants or whatever. So they quit college, bought an RV and started driving around the country, interviewing random people along the way.   What a trip.   First of all, I can't believe these guys actually got paid for taking road trips across the country. But they sure had the right idea. Why waste your prime years wasting away in study halls, stuck inside dorm rooms or labratories? Heck, I know a ton of guys my age who might spend 8 or 10 years studying to become doctors or engineers. My fear is that they'll wake up after graduating and realize, "I'm old!"   Obviously, the world needs doctors and engineers and what have you. And if that's your calling in life, then I wish you all the more luck. But I can't get over the fact that some people would rather put their futures ahead of their presents.   But back to my main point here: A road trip is more than just getting from point A to point B. It's the ride that counts. (Like the inspirational posters say: Life is a journey, not a destination). Fact is, the best road trips don't have set destination. Sometimes you don't know where you're headed, much less where you'll wind up. Of course it doesn't really matter where you go or what you do, as long as you have fun. And as long as you have someone along with you on the ride.  Usually the back roads are the better way to go. You won't see too much of the country if you keep to the Interstates the whole time. Make sure to stop at only local restaurants for some home cookin'. And you have to stop at as many of the 'historical marker' signs you can find. (Ronald Reagan's boyhood home is in Dixon, Ill., by the way.)   I suppose you can get all the tips you need from Jack Kerouac or the Motorcycle Maintenance guy. But really you ought to hit the road for yourself and make up your own rules. That's what the Road Trip Nation guys thought. And that's what Jack and I thought when we started road tripping.  Jack and I began the first episode of our baseball road trip in the summer of 2000. We met up in Nashville and drove to St. Louis, Kansas City and Arlington, catching a series at each stop. At each location, we'd walk around the city and take in the local sports bars, bowling alleys and disc golf courses. We may have even inspired our friend J.T. to take his own baseball road trip with some of his family across the Midwest.   The saga continued last summer, when we drove from our jobs in the Grand Canyon out to California, looking up baseball schedules on the fly. We stormed through Chavez Ravine, Edison International Field of Anaheim, Networks Associates Colliseum and Pac Bell Park. Slept in the back of the van most of the time -- much to the dislike of local authorities. Met up with some relatives in Stinson Beach and swam, surfed and sailed to our heart's delight.  Now I'm planning yet another road trip to Mardi Gras in two weeks. I'm currently in Anderson, S.C., interning at a newspaper here. But to tell you the truth, I'd much rather be out on the road.

						   Fantasy baseball's right around the corner!  Hot damn!  And I, for one, cannot wait.  JT is already talking smack, telling me how much research he's going to do, but I don't need no stinkin' research, 'cause I already know it all.  Here's a question: who do you take now?  1)  Alex Rodriguez 2)  Alfonso Soriano 3)  Albert Pujols  4)   Your pick   Is the answer:  A)  Barry Bonds B)  Vladimir Guerrero C)  Mark Prior or D) I don't care, write more non-baseball articles!  The answer, of course, is E) JT is a jackass, 'cause he's gonna have the pick right before me and RIP ME UP REPEATEDLY!  Dammit.    Time to go outside.

						   Where did Lance Berkman's power go?    2001 slugging percentage, extra base hits: .620, 94 2002 slugging percentage, extra base hits: .587, 79 2003 slugging percentage, extra base hits: .515, 66  What happened?  For one thing, he had trouble hitting at home at Minute Maid Park in 2003: 884 OPS, 11 HR's - both way down from previous years.  Also, it seems that he's been putting in extra time working on batting right-handed against lefties.  Unfortunately, this has had the adverse effect of his splits while batting left-handed go down:  RH OPS, LH OPS  867, 1099 715, 1059 884, 973  The only problem with Lance concentrating on working on batting right-handed is that over 3/4 his at-bats are as a lefty.  I'm guessing that his RH OPS was so low in 2002 that he (and others) decided that he had to improve in that area.  However, you shouldn't always work on eliminating your weaknesses; sometimes you should just focus on your strengths.    Mathematically, it's not worth it for Lance to raise his RH OPS 169 pts if his LH OPS drops 86 points, simply because the great majority of his at-bats are as a lefty.  I admit that there's a chance that some of his more important at-bats will be as a righty because teams will bring in a lefty to pitch to him, but (on the other hand) the Astros might not even have as many 'important' at-bats if Lance doesn't get his power back.  Hopefully Lance will get back to what he was doing in 2001, and have a huge year.

						   Two quick notes.  One: Journalism major / little brother Andy Wade's going to start 'contributing' (haha...no, seriously) a lot more, especially when I depart for Europe in a few weeks.  By then the plan is to have all you guys hooked, at which point Andy will be free to write about whatever he wants.  But if that doesn't work, I'll remind him to write about baseball too.  But honestly, he's a better, funnier writer than I am, so this is good news.  Two: I was deleting all my old papers from college when I found this little essay from my favorite class ever,  Baseball in American Life .  Enjoy.   	 	"On June 8, 1996, Warren Morris becomes a collegiate legend, hitting “the most dramatic homer in the history of the College World Series.”  (Associated Press)  Morris’ two-run blast with two outs in the bottom of the ninth – his first homer of the season – gave the LSU Tigers the NCAA Championship over the University of Miami.  He was named a preseason All-American, but missed forty games after breaking his right hand in April – he returned to the lineup just before regionals. 	At the beginning of the 1999 season, Warren Morris, in his first year in the big leagues, is named the starting second baseman for the perennially disappointing Pittsburgh Pirates.  At the end of the 1999 season, Warren Morris has just completed one of the more remarkable rookie years in recent memory.  His numbers: G	AB	R	H	HR	RBI	OBP	SLG	AVG 147	511	65	147	15	73	.360	.427	.288 “Possessing impressive patience and control in the batter's box, Morris always appears to control the strike zone well. Equipped with a short line-drive stroke, he has good gap power, and should eventually reach the 20 home run plateau.  Morris has the make of .300 hitter, with good power potential, and is expected to improve on his stellar 1999 season.” (STATS, Inc.)  On May 17, 2001, Warren Morris is a twenty-seven year old second baseman for the Nashville Sounds.  After an unexpectedly disappointing 2000, he has been optioned to Nashville to try to recover his lost swing.  However, it is not easy to make it back to the major leagues.  On this night, Morris (initially batting .301) appears to be pressing a little too hard: 1st at-bat: 1st inning, Tike Redman on 3rd, 1 out.  With a runner in scoring position, Morris is expected to drive in the run, with a grounder to the right side, a sacrifice fly, or a base hit.  Instead, he fouls out to the third baseman on a 1-2 count.   2nd at-bat: 4th inning, 0 on, 0 out.  Morris (now batting .298) flies out to shallow center on a 2-2 count.  Morris, a speedy runner who has been known to beat out infield hits, has hit two weak pop flies. 3rd at-bat: 7th inning, 0 on, 0 out.  Morris (now batting .295) strikes out looking on a 3-2 count.  He trudges slowly back to the dugout, showing no emotion. 4th at-bat: 9th inning, 0 on, 1 out.  Morris (now batting .292) reaches on a weakly hit infield single to the pitcher on a 1-0 count.  He moves to second base on a single.  With his team down by two runs, the next hitter (the tying run) grounds out to 2nd base, ending the game.   Morris’ story, like baseball (and life), is full of highs and lows.  At twenty-one, you’re a College World Series hero; three years later you have a spectacular rookie year; two years later you’ve been demoted to the minors.  Perhaps this is one of the enduring characteristics of baseball – the fact that is so damn hard to consistently succeed.  I think that we all can relate to that."  5/14/01

						   Quick, name which team would probably have the most representatives in a 2004 NL Central-only All Star game.  My answer....  Catcher: Jason Kendall, Pirates  Honorable Mention: No one.  Jason LaRue, if you must.  Ausmus, Barret, Matheny, Eddie Perez...yikes.  First Base: Derrek Lee, Cubs. HM: Jeff Bagwell, Astros.  I'll give the Lee the nod; he's younger, faster, cheaper, less injured, and better defensively.  But Bagwell has more facial hair.  Second Base: Jeff Kent, Astros. HM: D'Angelo Jimenez, Reds. Kent's got more power, but Jimenez was awesome after coming to the Reds, and he lit up winter ball.  Shortstop: Edgar Renteria, Cards. HM: No one else is even close.  Third Base: Scott Rolen, Cards. HM: Morgan Ensberg, Astros. Rolen's awesome.  Look up his  urlLink stats .  (Check out his OPS+ line!)  Ensberg needs to prove he can do it again.  Right Field: Sammy Sosa, Cubs.   HM:  Richard Hidalgo, Astros. Cork or not, Sosa's more consistent, more patient, more powerful.  Hidalgo's got a better arm and more bullet wounds.  Center Field: Jim Edmonds, Cards. HM: Tie - Corey Patterson, Cubs, Scott Podsednik, Brewers. Edmonds is a monster when healthy - Patterson and Podsednik are suprisingly similar players (Patterson has a little more power, Podsednik a little more speed.)  Left Field: Albert Pujols, Cards (if they keep him there, and I've read that they will.) HM: Lance Berkman, Astros, Adam Dunn, Reds. Pujols is the second-most dangerous hitter in the game today - Dunn had 27 HR's, 74 BB's in only 381 AB's and is younger than Berkman.  Starting Pitcher: Mark Prior, Cubs. HM: Roy Oswalt, Astros. Prior is the best pitcher in the game today.  He's 23.  Oswalt's up there, but there are injury concerns.  Reliever: Octavio Dotel, Astros. HM: Latroy Hawkins, Cubs. To tell the truth, Hawkins could well be more valuable than Dotel next year because he could easily throw 20+ more innings since he hasn't been cursed with the closer label yet.  But I'll stick with Dotel for now.  Final tally:  Astros: 2 winners, 5 HM. Cubs: 3 winners, 2 HM. Cards: 4 winners, 0 HM. Reds: 0 winners, 2 HM. Brewers: 0 winners, 1 HM. Pirates: 1 winner, 0 HM.  So, what does all this mean?  The Astros have the most total 'votes', with 7.  I think they've got the most balanced team.  The Cubs are next with 5, and I could have easily added Kerry Wood, or Aramis Ramirez, but I felt like they just missed the cut.  Their pitching staff is young and dominant.  The Cards have the stars (Renteria, Rolen, Pujols, Edmonds), but too many holes, and very little pitching.  The Reds, Brewers, and Pirates?  Well, there's a reason everyone's calling it a 3 or 2 team race.  These last 3 teams just don't have the players yet.    Well, that's it for today.  Oh, in case you haven't heard, this blog was recently linked by  Aaron's Baseball Blog , which was (in many ways) the main inspiration for me to start writing about baseball.  So go visit  urlLink his site .  Now.

						   At last, it is time for  The Tournament  to continue.  Drew, it's all yours.  (For anyone that has no idea what this is, click  urlLink here  for Round 1.)   The Sandman's Uber-Supreme Championship of Toughness    ROUND 2  Well, it’s been a long time coming, but I finally decided to take some more of my precious study time away and write the second round.  I’d like to give a shout out to the many millions of new readers from  urlLink AstrosDaily .  Jack thinks that writing more about baseball will bring you in, but we all know the truth.  You all want to see who’s tough.  So, without further delay or rambling from me, I will get down to it.  Let’s get it on!   Mr. T vs. John Wayne  Wow!  Can I just say that before I get started?  What terrible luck it is that these two guys would have to meet in the second round.  Both seem pretty über if you think about it.  However, this tournament is not about perceived toughness, it is about how many hot dogs one can eat!  Wait, sorry, I just reverted to Harry Carry-mode.  I guess I just got a little excited about Vandy’s win over Kentucky last night and remembered the good times with the Wadester and the Maniacs.  Good times Norm.  Anyway, these two guys were both college football players.  Can you imagine Mr. T attempting to tackle you?  Hell, I would soil myself right there.  On the other side, John Wayne played several years at USC.  Props go to the USC Trojans this year for having a great season and getting second place.  I’m sure it would have made The Duke proud; although if he had been on the team, there’s no way miniscule California would have taken them down.  Alright, let’s get down to it.  I mentioned in the first round that Mr. T was America’s Toughest Bouncer.  Well, unluckily for him, John Wayne has developed a fighting style that’s perfectly designed to fight a bouncer.  His friend once bet him that if they stood on opposite sides of a newspaper, The Duke couldn’t hit him.  He laid the paper down in a doorway, and just when Wayne was about to swing, he shut the door.  To most people, this would have caused a problem, but never count his Dukeness out.  Wayne punched through the door and floored his buddy.  Ok, that’s what John Wayne did to his friend, imagine what he’d do to T.  Geez, I can’t believe I just made Mr. T lose.   Alexander Karelin vs. Jet Li  Alright all of you martial arts fans out there.  I’m sure most of you are counting this match as over and done with before I write anymore.  Well, if there’s one thing that the Ultimate Fighting Championship has shown us, it is that grappling and wrestling are invaluable skills when fighting.  So, this should be a pretty good match.  At this point I’m just going to describe a little bit more about Karelin, dubbed The Experiment, for those of you who don’t know too much about him.  If you’ll remember, Karelin KO’d Hulk Hogan last round with something called the reverse body lift.  This move is Karelin’s signature move, and it has been the end of many of the world’s finest Olympic wrestlers.  Let me just give you a description of the move:  “First he wraps his arms around the stomach of his prone opponent and rolls him over in the ‘gut wrencher.’  Then, as the muscles in his massive arms and legs come alive as if there are snakes under his skin, he lifts the helpless guy up and tosses him over his shoulder.  Greco-Roman wrestling, unlike freestyle wrestling, allows only upper body grappling.  Throws are not uncommon, except in the superheavyweight division, for who could pick up a squirming 300-pound body?  Karelin can.”  It’s called “the most painful, frightening, and humiliating move in wrestling.”  Yeah, that’s pretty tough.  Ok, so why am I bringing up this throw maneuver so much?  If you’ll remember when Jet Li first introduced himself to American audiences, it was in the movie, Lethal Weapon 4.  In the climactic scene, Li squares off against Danny Glover and Mel Gibson.  Of course, everyone knew that Li was going to lose, but it should have come from some unbelievable luck from the dynamic duo.  NO!  They actually held their own against Jet for a while.  The key move in this analysis comes during this fight.  Jet Li, master of Chinese martial arts, gets picked up by an old guy and thrown over his shoulder.  This sounds eerily similar to Karelin.  I’m sorry Jet, I know you’re fast, but how are you going to take out a man who weighs 300 lbs and is every bit as fast as you?  Karelin ends up putting Li in the reverse body lift, and he still hasn’t landed.   Dolph Lundgren vs. Sylvester Stallone  Here’s a great rematch for ya.  Rocky IV’s climactic final fight was one of the greatest boxing fights of cinematic history.  The hulking Russian vs. the smaller, but still beast, American.  Rocky, Stallone, won that fight of course.  That, however, was in movieland, and we all know that Dolph Lundgren always gets his butt wrapped up and handed to him in a basket in movieland.  I’m just going to make this short and sweet.  Remember, that Stallone’s only formal training was getting some boxing lessons while filming the Rocky movies.  Lundgren undoubtedly got the same type of training.  This should give the edge slightly to Stallone since he did five movies in the Rocky series.  Unfortunately, when you add in Lundgren’s karate skills, the match just gets silly.  The European heavyweight karate champion is going to destroy the fictional world boxing champion.  I wish I could add more to this analysis, but Stallone just doesn’t belong here in the second round.   Bruce Lee vs. Lou Ferrigno  I shall call this match, the Berzerker Match.  Both of these fighters have the berzerker-mode option.  Ferrigno, as you recall, played the Hulk in its original form.  There was no need to make him a CGI character when Ferrigno was around.  He was TOUGH!  For the uneducated and utterly hopeless people reading this, I’ll give a bit of an explanation.  When a wimpy scientist guy gets a little miffed, his body expands and he rips through his clothes (saving us the horror at looking at a green pecker of course) becoming the Hulk.  Bruce Lee has a similar mode.  The few times that he seems to be having a little bit of trouble in his fights, Bruce usually just kinda looks at the guy, tastes his own blood, rips his shirt off, then flexes for a bit.  I’ve never seen anyone that had more control over every single muscle in his body.  Well, once he’s in that mode, there’s just no stopping him.  Not even claws, ala Vega from Street Fighter, can stop him.  Ok, so it’s Hulk vs. enraged little Chinese man.  I mean, the Hulk could throw a tank for miles, how’s he going to have trouble with Lee.  Well, the Hulk was not supposed to be that strong, it was just a little exaggeration on the part of Ang Lee, who made the recent dud of a movie.  The other weakness Ferrigno has for him is that the Hulk is fictional.  I’m sure you all knew that this observation was coming, but after the cheap shot I gave you all with the Stallone/Lundgren fight being so short, I thought that I would make this one a bit longer.  In truth, this fight is probably over much quicker.  Bruce Lee doesn’t even have to resort to berzerker-mode because Ferrigno won’t even be able to hit him.  Sorry Lou, but Bruce Lee finds you quite cute and cuddly when you’re angry.

						   A Few Baseball Notes:  Pudge Rodriguez officially agreed to a 4-year, $40 million deal with the Detroit Tigers yesterday.  He immediately said, "I don't think of the Tigers as a bad team...they just had a bad year."  Conversely, a poster on  urlLink Baseball Primer  wrote  If all the moves the Tigers have made over the offseason result in 20 more wins...the Tigers will still lose 99 games .  I don't think this is a great move, though - $10 million a year for 4 years to a 32-year old catcher?  Pudge is a Hall-of-Famer, yes; his last six season have produced OPS+ values (OPS+ = OPS compared to the rest of the league, taking ballparks into account - 100 is average) of 120, 125, 152, 130, 123, and 124.  He's still got a great throwing arm, and his Defensive Range Factor is well above league average.  But, as has been mentioned elsewhere...he's a 32-year old catcher, and 32-year old catchers simply do not age well.  Pudge is such a unique player that he's not truly similar to anybody, but according to  urlLink Baseball Reference , his most similar players include Ted Simmons, Yogi Berra, Gary Carter, and Joe Torre.  All of these players experienced a fairly significant offensive decline following their age-32 season, particularly Simmons and Carter.  The human body wasn't meant to squat for two hours a day, 162 days a year, which doesn't include practice, postseason, spring training, etc.  It's hard on the legs, thighs, and ankles, and it's gotta make you hella stiff.  Although it is true that sports medicine is much better than it was during the careers of the four previous catchers, I still don't believe Pudge will be the same player four years from now that he is today.  Would I love to have Pudge on my team.  Hell yeah!  For 4 years @ 40 million?  Nope.  Not even to replace Brad Ausmus.   There have been murmurs that the Astros might go after Ugueth Urbina as either a closer or a set-up man.  First things first: yeah, he's still pretty good - he averages well over a strikeout an inning for his career, he's only (about to be) 30 years old, and he was lights-out after joining the Marlins midway through the year.  BUT: He'll be expensive.  He's earned 4.2, 6.7, and 4.5 million the last 3 years, and now he's got World Series Ace Reliever stamped on him.  There was also a very nice study done over at  urlLink BPRo  that argued NO reliever is worth that much money, simply because: even great relievers don't last long, they get injured often (Robb Nen, Wagner in '00), and they only pitch 80 (at most) innings a year.  I'm sure Urbina will get a multi-year deal somewhere, probably something like 2 years, 10 million.  I hope it's not in Houston.

						   Wow.  What a weird Super Bowl:  With 5 minutes left in the first half, the score was 0-0.  At halftime, the score was 14-10, New England.  At the end of the third quarter the score was still 14-10.  At the end of the game it was 32-29 New England.  At the end of the first quarter, Jake Delhomme was 1-of-9 for 1 yard.  By the end of the game, he was 16-for-33 for 323 yards and 3 TD's.  20 minutes into the game, Carolina had 0 net yards.  By the end of the game, they had amassed 387 yards, including the longest TD drive (95 yards) and the longest TD pass (85 yards) in Super Bowl history.  All numbers aside, the Panthers simply did not play well enough to win the game.  Their vaunted defense was dominated most of the night; if Vinatieri goes 3-for-3 and Brady doesn't throw a stupid, stupid interception from the 10, the Patriots easily score 40 points.  They had 12 penalties.  They allowed 4 sacks.  John Kasay couldn't even keep his last kickoff inbounds with 68 seconds to play.  The Panthers couldn't stop the run OR the pass, especially near the end of the game, when they had to have a stop.  Carolina cornerback Ricky Manning, hero of the NFC Championship game, repeatedly got ripped by David Givens, Deion Branch, and anyone else the Patriots threw at him.  Hell, the entire Panthers secondary absolutely SUCKED when the game was on the line.  Their supposedly terrific defensive line was also nullifed; Brady was never sacked, and although he was repeatedly rushed and hit hard, he generally had enough time to find the open receiver(s).  I just can't get over how bad the Panthers defense was.  It seemed like they guessed wrong on every single play all night.  Early on, they stopped the pass, so the Patriots ran the ball well.  Then they load up to stop the run and Brady rips them on two play-action passes for TD's.  Then at the end of the game they allow three straight scoring drives when one stop could mean the difference in their season.    Oh yeah, the commercials weren't all that great either.  My top few were: 1)  NFL - "Tomorrow" song, Jerry Jones does cartwheels   2)  Budweiser - The Clydsedale Donkey  and 3)  Frito/Lay - Old People Battle for chips .  But good commercials were few and far between, with tons of crap like CBS promos, AOL 9.0 crap, and the most boring car commercials ever.  All in all, kind of a lackluster Super Bowl, with the main excitement being how the hell the Panthers will score next and a nice shot of Janet Jackson's right breast at the end of halftime.  But it's still the Super Bowl, a celebration of football, fun, and American excess.  You gotta love it, right?

						   Yesterday I received two phone calls at almost exactly the same time from two of my friends telling me that this blog had just been added as a link from  AstrosDaily , the best Astros site on the internet, and one that you can visit by checking out my links at the bottom of the page.  To some of you, this may not seem like such a big deal, and to those of you who fall into this category, I must respectfully ask you to shove it, because this is a big deal, and it rocks, and it is the best.  What this means for this blog is I'm going to talk about baseball a little bit more often.  Don't worry, I'll still have time for occasional ramblings, guest blogs, etc.  There was an interesting article in today's  Chronicle  by Richard Justice.  Justice is pretty good, although he occasionally Writes.  In only.  Short Sentences.  For Maximum.  Dramatic Effect.  But I like most of his articles.  Today he wrote about Astros manager Jimy Williams, and that although he may be on the hot seat (which would be new to me), he shouldn't be, because he is a good manager, a player's manager, and a professional.  Let's take an in-depth look at Jimy Williams:  He is 866-746 for his career, a .537 winning percentage. He managed the Toronto Blue Jays from 1986-1989, finishing 4th-2nd-3rd-4th. He managed the Boston Red Sox from 1997-half of 2001, finishing 4-2-2-2-2. He's managed the Houston Astros in 2002 and 2003, finishing 2nd and 2nd.  A new way to judge managers, which may or may not be completely accurate, is to look at a team's expected win-loss (also known as Pythagorean) record (bases on runs scored^2 and runs allowed^2) and see how this compares to their actual won-loss record.  The theory is that a good manager will get the most out of his team, winning more close games than he loses, etc.    ( Thanks to FredUD for these stats: )For reference, Bobby Cox has 'beaten' Pythagoras 11 out of 13 years - he has 'added' 30 wins over those 13 years.  Dusty Baker has 'beaten' Pythagoras 7 out of 11 years, and is +18 overall.  *Drum roll*  Jimy Williams has beaten Pythagoras 1 out of 11 years, and is -36 overall.   -36 wins / 11 years = -3.27 wins per year.  -3.27 WINS PER YEAR!!   I know this isn't the most reliable statistic in the world, but if you're an Astros fan this has to make you sit up and take notice.    One thing I think Jimy does well is manage his starting pitchers.  He caught a lot of flak last year for having a quick hook, but I thought he did an excellent job, particularly with Oswalt, Miller, and Redding - there is a (hard-to-define) correlation between high pitch counts and injury, and Williams is playing it safe.  Dusty Baker, on the other hand, had Mark Prior and Kerry Wood throw 120+ pitches per game multiple times each down the stretch, which may well have damaging long-term effects.  Here are some other interesting numbers:  The 2003 Houston Astros ranked 14th in the NL in stolen bases attempted.  I think this is a good thing - we certainly didn't have any speed demons, and there has been work done that demonstrates stealing bases is generally overrated - it's usually not worth risking an out.  The Astros had 61 sacrfice bunts, which ranks 13th-lowest in the NL.  I think this is a great thing - we're not giving away many 'free outs'.  The Astros issued 53 intentional walks, which ranks 6th-highest in the NL.  I think this is a little high, especially since we don't play in a division with Barry Bonds.  The only guy I would intentionally walk in the NL Central is Pujols.  No one else.  I think Jimy has done a good job handling the pitching staff, and we're not wasting tons of outs bunting and stealing, so why does he have such a bad record against Pythagoras?  I don't know, but I don't like it.  He better do pretty damn well this year, because he certainly has the talent to go a long way.  Otherwise, I'll be one of the first in line calling for his replacement.

						    urlLink So, who's it gonna be?   Assuming the Astros go with 11 pitchers (they might go with 12, but I think we need another backup IF besides Lamb and Viz), and it seems clear that they'll go with Dotel, Lidge, and Miceli, that leaves 3 other relievers...  So, pick 3 from Ricky Stone, Brandon Duckworth, Brandon Backe, Jared Fernandez, and Mike Gallo.  Ok, first of all, Stone should absolutely be on there.  I'm going to assume he makes it, so that leaves 2 spots.  I say give one of them to Fernandez, because of his incredible variety.  Need a spot starter?  A guy who can pitch every day, or soak up innings when you're losing 16-2?  Plus I just like the idea of having a knuckleballer on the staff to complement all the hard throwers.  Finally, a fairly tough decision...Duckworth or Backe?    I'm going with Duckworth, but it's close.  Backe is death on righties; unfortunately for him, so is most of our bullpen.  Duckworth is better against lefties, but he still allows too many fly balls and he needs to really increase his strikeouts.  Hopefully he does it this year.  But don't expect him to become mini-Dotel overnight.  What about Gallo?  Here's the thing about Gallo.  Jimy has said that it's 'nice' to have at least one LHP in the bullpen.  Ok, maybe it's nice, but how many left-handed batters are there that scare you in our division?  Jim Edmonds.  Adam Dunn.  Griffey if he is healthy.  I think that's about it, honestly.  When you consider the whole NL, there are a few more (Bonds, Helton, Giles, Thome...damn, those guys are pretty good)...but it's not like Gallo is unstoppable against them, and...I don't know, I just don't like the idea of using a roster slot on a pitcher that is ONLY going to come in against lefties.  That's just me.  So my all-righty bullpen, with 2003 OPS splits against righties, then lefties:  Dotel (closer)                                                           (564 , 533 .....DAMN) Lidge (setup)                                                           (556 , 719) Miceli (black-belt in judo...and also setup)                    (710 , 736) Stone (tough on righties, double-play specialist)          (645 , 830) Duckworth (tough on lefties, needs more strikeouts)   (953 , 685 ) Fernandez (Pitching Utility Guy, aka PUG)                    (628, 716)  So, in summary, don't use Stone much against lefties, or Duckworth against righties.  And Octavio Dotel is so good.

						    urlLink It has begun .    So I'm hanging around Paris when I find this English bookstore with a TON of magazines, one of which happens to be  The Sporting News .  It's got Mark Prior and Curt Schilling on the cover and proudly claims that the Cubs and Red Sox will meet in the World Series.  Ok, first of all, way to definitely jinx both teams.  Then they talk about the NL Central, and mention a few things about the Astros that I have issues with.    First of all, they say that Pettitte AND Clemens AND Oswalt are all likely to get injured at some point during the year.  Well, so far only their cover boy Prior has been hurt.  But anyway, this addresses a common misconception about pitchers:  Only Old Pitchers Get Hurt .  Baseball Prospectus did a big study of this a few years back, and they found that once a pitchers reaches a certain age (31 or 32 or so) their chances of injury drop, because they've passes an injury threshold.  Obviously, this is very general, but I think young pitchers coming off a year where they threw way more pitches than they have before including numerous 120+ pitch outings are more likely to miss time than a 41 year old pitcher who has been pitching for 20 years and has NEVER missed significant time due to injury.  Furthermore, Jimy's occasional saving grace is he's gentle with his starting pitchers.  Dusty Baker is not.  If you ask me whether the Astros or Cubs will have the healthier staff this year, I gotta go with the Astros, old age and all.    John Lauck over at AstrosDaily has been doing awesome game summaries for every Astros Spring Training game.  Major props to Mr. Lauck, and his recaps are always great.  But I'm going to quote him a few times, and let you read them, and then I'll argue against them tomorrow, because I'm out of time for today.   " To put the matter plainly, Everett is now in his best spot--second--and the Astros should encourage him to do exactly what he did in this spot: bunt. Everett should be bunting like crazy, and stealing bases every chance he gets....If Everett bunts as much as he ought to, and if he steals as many bases as he can, his percentage of success might not be as high as we'd like; as high as Bagwell's steal percentage, perhaps, but the idea in having him bunt and steal is not entirely to be successful all the time ."  - John Lauck   " My respect for Vizcaino has grown immensely since he became an Astro. Like every good pinch-hitter, he has had--and will have--his share of failures, but there is no one else, not Bagwell, not Berkman, not Kent, that I would rather see up there at the plate when Houston needs a simple base hit for a single run. Vizcaino's experience under pressure and his deft bat control are a quality and a talent I'll bet the Yankees wish they had back right now, but New York can't have him. Vizcaino belongs to the Astros, and he fits a need on this club so deep that no one wants to contemplate what another extended absence of him during the upcoming season would mean. " - John Lauck

						   Paris is unstoppable.  Except I can't stop eating crepes with Nutella.  But I now know how to make them.  Baseball season is about to start!  In Japan, that is, as the Yankees get to pound on the Devil Rays.  And Derek Jeter is batting leadoff for the Yanks, which means he's gonna steal some bases for my fantasy team.  Sweet.  Oh, and Jason Giambi is hitting in between ARod and Gary Sheffield.  I mean, COME ON.  He's going .300-50-150 this year, JT.  And 10 stolen bases (haha.)  So tomorrow I gotta book a Chunnel trip.  Yep, I'm going underground on my way back to London - apparently it is quick and cheap and much more efficient than spending all day on buses and ferries.  So there ya go.  Oh, and Mark Prior is really hurting.  I posted this a while ago, but even though he plays for the evil Cubs, it's too bad.  Prior is incredible, and I would feel weird if the Astros win the division because Prior misses significant time.  I'd get over it quickly, though.  Other baseball news...there's a  urlLink Jeff Bagwell article  I read the other day that is kinda sad.  I mean, the guy is in agony.  It sounds like he doesn't even enjoy playing anymore.  But before you get all huffy, look at this.  And look at his 1994 season.  GOOD LORD.    368/451/750   for the 400 at-bats???  I know he's not what he once was.....but neither is ANYONE besides Bonds and Pujols.  Daaaaamn.  So if we do eventually trade Bagwell (but I don't think we will) or he slowly declines, just remember that he and Biggio were once our entire offense, and they did a pretty good two-man job of it for a while.    Ok, that's it.

						   Hey, so  urlLink Peter Gammons chimes in on the NL Central .  I like Gammons - even though he talks about music too much (although not in this article) and says a lot of random crap, it's at least interesting random crap.  And he definitely seems to have the most connections of any baseball writer out there.  Plus I always love it when him and Harold Reynolds get in arguments on Baseball Tonight, with Gammons stumbling over words and HR basically smiling and moving his hands the whole time.  It's fun.    But moving on, read that article.  And then let me tell you what I think:  .....  Well, he doesn't really say anything new.  The lineup should indeed have some thunder, although the Power 5 (Biggio can't really be said to have that much thunder anymore) are kind of offset by the Weak 3.  And the pitching staff should be solid, and has been damn good this spring.  And yeah, we do have a surplus of starting pitching.  But that might be a good thing, actually, because I think the odds of Oswalt and Clemens staying completely healthy the whole year might be rather slim.  Don't get me wrong, I hope they do, but if they don't, it'll be nice to have Saarloos or Carlos Hernandez or Duckworth to fall back on.    JT's got a great idea - he read that the Indians and Mets are both interested in Jeriome Robertson, so he suggests we trade him to the Indians for one of their many OF prospects (Alex Escobar, Ryan Ludwick, Coco Crisp, and the probably untouchable Grady Sizemore).  I say....DO IT.  I'm in Paris for a few days, and so far it's pretty awesome.  Sidewalk cafes, tons of laaaaadies, crazy drivers, and big public parks.  Two thumbs up.

						   Did I mention how much I hate Jimy Williams?  I read somewhere the other day about how he doesn't really care for Ensberg.  The reason obviously escapes me....I just can't figure it out.  But this is apparently the reason he's been dropped to the #7 spot in the lineup.  So the Lamb deal...I like it, on one condition.  He gives us a lefty of the bench and a backup infielder that allows us to NOT keep Valentin or Brunlett...I think he'll be a better backup to Ensberg at 3rd.  However, if Jimy starts pulling this platoon type shit that he pulled last year w/ Ensberg and Blum, then I'm going to have to hunt him down and knock some sense into him.

						   I'm in Cote d'Azur (home of Derek's greatest Gran Turismo triumph, and don't worry Derek - it's still saved!) in Southern France, home of blue oceans (but no sand) and plenty o' tourists.  I booked a trip to Paris on Sunday, where I'll be for 2/3 days and then London and then hooooome.  Vandy got beat down by UConn, 73-53.  They got up early, we made a run, and they said NO.  Matt Freije, hero of the NC State game, never got going, finishing 3-of-18.  UConn's been dominant so far in the tournament; they might go all the way.  It was a great run, 'Dores.  Gerry Hunsicker once again proves it's not all about the big signings.  The Astros traded for Mike Lamb yesterday, getting a decent backup 3B, 1B, OF, and another LH bat off the bench.  It might not seem like much, but I like this move ok- I was having nightmares about Ensberg getting hurt and being replaced by my nemesis, Jose Vizcaino.  That's about the best thing you can say about Lamb, though...he's better than Vizcaino.  Lamb's got a career line of 282/336/385, and he is a damn bad fielder.  Whole lotta errors, and not much range.  So don't jump for joy - but it still takes a bit of a load off my mind.  Well, that's it, really.  I'm almost home, where I'll jump back into everything right away, after catching up on some sleep.  See you all soon.

						   The biggest Vandy fan I know (sorry, Drew), gives his recap of the last minutes of The Comeback:   Part B: I hope you've been able to see some March Madness scores over there. By the time you get home, I hope to have a DVD of Vandy's amazing comeback from 11 down in the last 3 minutes to upset NC State, 75-73. It was the grittiest, most amazing comeback I've seen in many many years. We scored 21 points on our last 7 (really just 6) possessions over the last 3 minutes!--Frieje fouled twice on treys, making all 6 FT's, nailing a long covered trey, a 5-point play (intentional foul, 2 Smith FT's followed by an impossible Moore trey), a long Freije 2-ptr for the lead & finally Moore hitting Smith with a perfect backdoor pass for the layup & FT to recapture the lead for good with 21 seconds left. Frieje simply refused to let the team give up: he was all over his teammates at every timeout, & finished with 31.  So we're in the Sweet Sixteen, 'cause in the earlier first round we had beaten a talented Western Michigan team 72-59.  Now we go on to face UConn on Thursday (6pm Central time: should be midnight or 1am Friday in Europe) to try to move on to Vandy's first Elite Eight appearance since 1965! Alabama upset Stanford: they're the only other SEC team left, as KY & Miss State were upset by UAB & Xavier, respectively.  - Dad   You better get the DVD, Dad, although JT and Nicole did give me a damn good play-by-play on IM.  I just had my 2nd fantasy baseball draft the other day.  It's a league with JT and Todd and Brandon and some other fools (10 teams total).    I had the 2nd pick, then 19th, 22nd, etc.  My first 5 picks:  Alfonso Soriano Magglio Ordonez Lance Berkman Tim Hudson Jason Giambi  Not bad, right?  But how about these first 5, starting with the 7th pick, then 14th, etc.  Carlos Beltran Pedro Martinez Bobby Abreu Roy Oswalt Jeff Kent (just for fun)  Derek Jeter  That would be JT's team.  Damn.  Oh, and the players I have in both leagues:  Lance Berkman Josh Phelps Octavio Dotel Miguel Batista Francisco Cordero Aquilino Lopez  Basically I have the same RPs in both leagues.  So if Dotel, Cordero, or Lopez suck it...I'm done.  Oh, and I'm having this argument over at AstrosDaily about batting Adam Everett 2nd, which it looks like Jimy is going to do.  I was going to ask JT if there is anything that Jimy has done wrong this spring, because I didn't think there was...now, I stand corrected.  Batting AE 2nd would be a huge mistake.  What are the 'reasons' why AE might make a good 2 hitter?  1.  He can bunt guys over, hit and run, and make 'productive outs'. 2.  He's fast 3.  It breaks up the crappy 7-8-9 of Everett/Ausmus/P from last year.  Ok, one by one:  1.  You do not want to make 'productive outs' with the Big 5 coming up.  The Astros do not exactly have the look of a small ball team anyway.  We're basically old, slow, right-handed, and crush the ball.  The Astros should not be playing for the one-run-at-a-time strategy.  With the power hitters on our team, we should ALWAYS be going for the 3-run HR.    Just for the heck of it, if you still believe in bunting runners over:  2003 Runs Scored, then Rank in Home Runs, Walks, and Sacrifices.  1.  Boston    2nd    3rd      27th    2.  Atlanta    3rd     13th    10th 3.  Toronto   10th   12th    30th 4.  Yankees   4th    1st      26th  Which of those columns is not like the other?  No small ball, Jimy.  No small ball.  2nd.  Yeah, he is fast.  But do you really want to even risk an out stealing a base?  If he is so fast bat him 7th or 8th so Ausmus or the pitcher can bunt him over easily.  3rd.  Who cares?  Get your best hitters the most at-bats.    I realize if you are reading this you probably know this stuff already, but it makes me feel better to write it.  Anyway, it doesn't matter, it looks like AE is gonna bat 2nd all year, making the odds of our 3rd hitter coming up with 0 outs even less likely, since if Biggio gets on, Everett is gonna bunt him over some of the time.  Oh well.    Oh, I just found out that I got in to Northern Arizona University for grad school!  Woohoo!  It's been a good 48 hours.

						   Vandy.  Vandy.  Oh.  Hell.  Yeah.  According to BPrimer, several teams (Red Sox, Blue Jays, A's) are interested in Kirk Saarloos.  I'm about his biggest fan, but honestly, we might as well trade him.  He's had incredible minor league numbers but he has struggled a bit in the majors, and we need young position prospects a LOT more than we need young pitchers.  The Blue Jays, especially, are chock full of good OF prospects, so we should get one.  Yeah.  Oh, and I just saw the Sistine Chapel.  Awesome.  Bye!

						   I'm in Siena, Italy for a few days, trying to work out the crick in my neck from staring up at the buildings too much.  It's pretty cool, but I gotta admit, I am starting to get ready to be back home.  Tennis, rafting, friends, and family...plus I have a big list of new stuff to try when I get back, like learning how to play a musical instrument, taking more Spanish classes, and hiking the Appalachian Trail.    Mark - Quick, name a 'proven' player from the 2002 World Champion Anaheim Angels.  Name one from the 2003 Florida Marlins besides Pudge Rodriguez.  I know where you are coming from, but I don't agree.  What defines a 'proven' player?  One big hit?  The fact that they are on the right team?  You argue that the Yankees and Braves have consistently made the playoffs because of proven players...but both those teams have made the playoffs basically every year for the last ten years or so WITH COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLAYERS from year to year.  No more Glavine on the Braves?  No prob.  No more David Cone or Paul O'Neill or Tino Martinez for the Yankees?  Don't worry.  It's not about proven players, it is about good players.  And I think that getting to the playoffs is huge - once you are in, anything can happen.  Beltran is not one of the best players in baseball, yet.  But he should get better, and he is pretty good already, so I think he might be worth it.  Andy -  You're right, Beltran is not the 2nd coming of ARod.  His career high in OPS (911) is lower than Berkman's career OPS (970!!!)  And yeah, stolen bases are overrated.  But when you take into account his excellent defense and his youth and the fact that the Astros have NO good OF prospects, I think that he would be worth 5/65.  Unfortunately, Beltran is represented by Scott Boras...so I think he will get more than that.  Let's see how he does this year, though...just 3 years ago I had Beltran on my fantasy team and he sucked it up.  So let's see how he does with Big Expectations.

						   Enough about Beltran....  It would appear that having a college degree is over-rated.  Apparently the only people who think Carlos Beltran is great are the ones with degrees.  Interestingly enough, no one on any baseball show is talking about him. Andy makes some great points...and I am glad to hear that I am not the only one who noticed that Berkman played center.  Also...has anyone noticed that Beltran didn't finish in the top 20 in any major offensive catagory.  He is seriously unproven...teams make the playoffs and world series with proven players.  That is why the Yankees and Braves have been so consistent, the Astros have made the playoffs with proven players, but didn't surround them with enough proven players, that is the reason that they actually have a chance to advance this year...with depth and experience...(Pettite and Clemens). Bringing in a young unproven player will not help them.  Mark

						   We're gonna take a break from filling out our brackets and talk about how Carlos Beltran is NOT that good. Let's look at his numbers, shall we?                Avg.       OBP       SLG       OPS       HR       RBI         R        SB 2001    .306     .362     .514    .876     24     101     106     31 2002    .273     .346     .501    .847     29     105     114     35 2003    .307     .389     .522    .911     26     100     102     41  Those numbers are pretty good. But he's not the best player in baseball by any means. Probably not even top 10. OBP being the most important statistic, Beltran's 3-year average of about .370 is darn good but not spectacular. Hell, Biggio had a .350 OBP last year. Berkman shattered that with a .412 OBP... in an off year. Beltran's .515 SLG% is also decent, but not too far ahead of the pack. The Big Five all had comparable percentages last year. His homerun numbers are not too impressive, and he has yet to crack 30 in a season.   Stolen bases, as Jack will attest, are by far the least important baseball statistic. Statistically speaking, you're only helping your team if you can steal bases around 75% of the time. Beltran has stolen 150 bases and has gotten thrown out 20 times in his career, which is unheard of. Still, stolen bases are overrated.   Keep in mind that Beltran has been playing in the weakest division in baseball over the past 3-4 years. He's been teeing off on the kids from Detroit and Cleveland, and the rotations from Chicago and Minnesota don't scare anyone.   Also, Beltran plays a fairly deep position. Your average outfielder can give you a .750 or .800 OPS. Yes, centerfield is a much more defense-oriented position, but if Berkman can play there, anyone can.   The major thing he's got going for him is that he's turning 27 this April. So there's room for improvement.   So, in conclusion: Beltran is good. Ok, Beltran is even great, but he's not AMAZING. Like A-Rod amazing or Bonds amazing. Or Wade amazing.

						   I'm taking a 20 hour ferry to Italy in a few hours, so I gotta run.   JT, you need to email me and remind me when our next draft is, fool.  Andres, are you back in Chicago?  How was the rest of Anderson?  Oh yeah, baseball.  Check out all-baseball.com for an NL Central preview.  It's generally a Cubs lovefest, but they say some good things about the Astros.  One thing that struck me is that they are not huge fans of Pettitte and Clemens, saying that they won't be that much of an upgrade over Villone and Roberston.  %@@@$????????????????/  Are you kidding me?    But yeah, read it...if that's the wrong email address, check out The Cub Reporter at the bottom of the page and link from there.  More in a few days.

						   After taking too many pictures at the Acropolis and Lycavitos Hill yesterday, I'll be trying to go for quality over quantity for a few days.  I only have one of my original disposable cameras left.   The Astros lost 6-1 to the Marlins, yada yada yada, HOW ABOUT MY ALMA MATER!! Good ol' Vanderbilt has been playing some serious basketball lately.  The women's team, after a slow start to the year, just went out and won the SEC tournament for an automatic NCAA bid, and the men's team, after a hot start and slow middle, just beat #5 Mississippi State on their way to the SEC semifinals.  They then lost to Florida, but we are all but guaranteed of a decent seed in the NCAAs.  Of course, I was saying the same thing freshman year, when we had at least 4 or 5 wins against top 25 teams....but this year they can't keep us out.  We're too good.  Oh, and you may have heard about the Madrid bombings.  They are a huge deal over here - all of Europe is pretty close, both geographically and emotionally (especially since the introduction of the EU), so any tragedy like this is tough to take.  Approximately 200 dead and 1400 wounded from bombs on the rail system - the same rail system that I've used several times while going around Europe.  Over one million mourners turned out in Spain, and there are been moments of silence and flags at half-mast throughout Europe.  It's a sad time.    Well, it's beautiful outside, and we're heading out for the day, so I have to run.  More baseball next time.

						   I'm flying to Athens for my Greek Week of the trip.  Hopefully less snow than Vienna...  Roy Oswalt pitched great again yesterday as the Astros won 1-0, but the most encouraging sign was probably the bullpen, as Mike Gallo, Dan Miceli, Taylor Bucholz, and Ricky Stone all threw scoreless innings.  Sweet.  There has been a big argument over at AstrosDaily about Craig Biggio.  Some argue that his defense is terrible; some say it is average.  Some say his offense is unacceptable; some say it is average.  The truth?    Craig Biggio's defense last year, from several advanced metrics:  Rate2   -10 UZR     -23 Pinto    -3  So I don't think you can argue Biggio is league average defensively.  He is below average, does not have a good arm, and has little speed.    Craig Biggio's offense  OBP  .350 SLG  .412 OPS  .762 GPA  .261 EQA  .262  None of those are particularly good for a center fielder, although they aren't terrible.  But they are not likely to get better; Biggio is simply too old to expect an improvement.  In short, Biggio is significantly below average defensively and slightly below average defensively.    Sorry, but it's true.  Jason Lane in 2005!  Oh, and there is more good stuff over at the Cub Reporter about how the Cubs offense should be better than the Astros this year, which is simply wrong.  Several of their observations include the fact that Lee will hit 40 HR's, Alou 30, Ramirez 35, Sosa 50, and Patterson 25.  They don't mention the OBPs of those players from last year:  Lee .379, Sosa .358, Alou .357, Patterson .329, Ramirez .314  Compared with the 5 best Astros hitters OBPs:  Berkman .412,  Hidalgo .385, Ensberg .377, Bagwell .373, Kent .351  That is a huge difference.  The Astros offense should continue to be better than the Cubs.

						   I'm adding two new blogs to the links at the bottom:  The Cub Reporter  and  Redbird Nation  Both these blogs are great, well-written, and I hate them, but only because they talk about the Cubs and Cardinals.  But they are worth reading, because you should "Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer." (The Godfather).    Oh, and Andy, one more thing about lineup construction:  Probably the most important strategy is to bunch your best hitters together.  In other words, you want to go for the big inning.  If you were to draw each players OPS as a line (the higher the OPS, the longer the line), you want as much overlapping as possible.  So as long as we run Bagwell/Kent/Berkman/Hidalgo/Ensberg in any order at teams, I think we'll be ok.

						   Hanging out at Cafe Central in Vienna, where exiled Lenin and Trotsky used to play chess.    Andy - Of course you're right on about having your high on-base guys at the top of the lineup.  And Ausmus is crap.  But, in the long run, it's not that important.  I am kinda worried that Jimy will bat Everett 2nd, which would mean 2 of the 4 worst hitters in our lineup (outside of Ausmus and P) will get the most at-bats.  This also probably means we will run more, when we really shouldn't be risking any outs with Bagwell, Kent, Berkman, Hidalgo, Ensberg coming up.  So...bat Everett lower.  And remember, Spring Training doesn't mean a thing....but it's still nice to win 14-2.    I think the Astros are pretty much set...Veres has done well this spring and Saarloos has not, so the bullpen might look like Dotel Lidge Duckworth Stone Veres Miceli Gallo, with Saarloos Hernandez and Robertson all at AAA.  But who knows?  The one thing I still fear is an injury to either Ensberg or Kent, which would result in Viz getting way too many ABs.  Other than that, I think we are ready to roll.  Andy, I saw Requiem for a Dream the other day.  Powerful stuff, even though the tape was so scratchy at the end I couldn't hear anything.  Oh, and have you read 'Howl', a poem by Allan Ginsberg?  Check it out.  Barstool, Mark - Did you guys play each other in the 1st round yet?  Barstool, did Mark make you switch to the 6.1?  Is it working?  JT - Poker updates?  Playing any tennis?  Oh, and Baseball Prospectus has a free article up at their site about the Astros (it is a PTP article...you'll see it.)  They talk about the bullpen, mostly, predicting a decline...their forecasting system is almost always cautious, though.  Finally, I just want to nominate the Billy Wagner-to-the-Phillies trade as one of the best moves of the offseason.  We traded 80 incredible innings for 3 good pitching prospects, and saved money which allowed us to sign 350-400 above-average innings in Pettitte and Clemens.  Well done, Mr. Hunsicker.  Best moves of the 2004 offseason  1.  Mike Cameron to the Mets. 2.  Vladi to the Angels. 3.  ARod to the Yankees. 4.  Billy Wagner trade. 5.  Kazuo Matsui to the Mets. 6.  Roger Clemens signing.

						   To me, what matters most in a lineup is having your top on-base guys bat first. If we'd had Berkman in the two-spot all year (and not Blumberg), Bagwell, Kent and Hidalgo would have had more runs to knock in. But instead we had him bat fifth, I think because Jimy wanted to break up our all-righthanded team.   Everett slugs 100 points higher than Ausmus. And if we keep our top two on-base guys batting 5th and 6th, that will matter a whole lot in the long run. The Astros need to realize what a terrible hitter Ausmus is, and do whatever they possibly can to minimize the damage he'll do to our offensive output. Put him in the eight-spot and give the other team 2 free outs. Rally next inning. At least it's better than sandwiching Everett between outs. He'll never have a chance to drive in runs, and when he does get on base, it's worthless. Everett's a young player and has nowhere to go but up. I think he'll exceed last year's stats. He won't dominate, but I think he'll hit .250 again, and maybe post a .750 OPS (.350, .400?). Hell, let Ausmus sacrifice for him.   Which brings up another point: Let's pinch-hit for Ausmus every game, every time a starter exits (which will hopefully be in the 7th and 8th innings this year). Think of what this could mean:  1) It will give Lane an pinch-hit at-bat every game he doesn't start  2) It will eliminate nearly a fourth of Ausmus' at-bats.   3) For the most part, our relievers don't really need a catcher's defense. The relievers already know how to throw (fast). And aside from Lidge's curve, I can't think of a single pitch that might need a require a great glove to stop.   Sure, a catcher's defense is probably most important during the final innings of a close game. But Chavez isn't terrible behind the plate.   Anything we can do to minimize the Ausmus effect. Just think: only two years ago, he led off. Wow.

						   I finally escaped Cesky Krumlov - now I'm in Vienna, Austria, where Mozart meets Wienerschnitzel.  It's snowing like crazy - my hostel is packed with ski bums.  I'll be here for until Friday, when I fly to Athens to hang with a friend (free couch!!)    Andy, about figuring out the 'best' lineup order....it's interesting, but doesn't really matter much.  Obviously it's best to give more AB's to your best (Berkman, Hidalgo) hitters, but mathematically speaking, it ends up not mattering very much even over 162 games.  I've read about 5-10 runs, max.  But it's still interesting to talk about.  I agree with your lineup, but I think batting Everett 8th might not be too bad since he's much, much faster than Ausmus, so he's less likely to be thrown out at 2nd after Roger Clemens lays down a bunt.  Speaking of which, that should be fun to watch.  I've only got 5 minutes left, so I can't do too much fantasy baseball draft analysis, but here's my thoughts on my team:  Jeremy @%@#$  Burnitz.  I thought I had a pretty good draft besides that; like usual, I'm relying heavily on 'sleepers' like D'Angelo Jimenez, Jason Bay, Miguel Batista, and Aquilino Lopez.  I'm lacking a bit in power (only Sexson had more than 30 HRs last year), but I've got a ton of speed (Beltran, Crawford, Jeter, Byrd, Lugo), probably over-compensating for past years when I have none.  I have a pretty good staff, especially if Rich Harden and Jerome Williams step up.  My closers are pretty bad, especially if Dotel gets hurt.  But all in all, not too bad.  And if Jeremy Burnitz goes .260/50/110, HA.

						   This from Ken Rosenthal:  The Dodgers are informing clubs of their willingness to trade RHP Edwin Jackson or LHP Greg Miller for the right hitter, but their options are limited. The team pursued Astros RF Richard Hidalgo before Paul DePodesta replaced Dan Evans as GM, trying to offset Hidalgo's $14 million salary by offering RHP Paul Shuey and C Todd Hundley, who will be paid a combined $10.9 million. The Astros would consider trading a pitcher for a lefthanded bat, but no longer are interested in moving Hidalgo, in part because Jason Lane has not proved he can hit major-league pitching. . . .   Apparently this is old news... maybe pre-Pettitte. I like that he says we're no longer interested in trading Hidalgo. But most of all, I understand better why Los Angeles has had such problems with ownership: Stupid trade offers like this.   A couple things I didn't like: Lane not being ready. There was a lot of argument about this on Astrosdaily. Basically the consensus reached was that Lane's 96 ABs mean nothing, and  agree with that. Too bad we haven't really given him a chance. I think he'd be decent, but nowhere near Hidalgo.   And I don't think we're looking for a lefty bat anymore. In fact, I think the only situation to monitor is the bullpen. And maybe the order of the 2-3-4-5-6 hitters. Seems Jimy and everyone else in baseball is assuming we'll stay with last year's lineup of Biggio-Ensberg-Bagwell-Kent-Berkman-Hidalgo.   First of all, Hidalgo was our best hitter last year with a .957 OPS. He did this while hitting in the six spot, right before the black hole that is Brad Ausmus. Think what he coulda done if we moved him up to #3. Hm. Contract year. Hm. Also, Berkman was outstanding at getting on base, with a .412 OBP. He was in the five spot. HM.   Last year's OBP and SLG:  Ensberg: .377, .530 Bagwell: .373, .524 Kent: .351, .509 Berkman: .412, .515 Hidalgo: .385, .572  Seems to me the best order would be Biggio-Berkman-Hidalgo-Bagwell-Kent-Ensberg-Everett-Ausmus.   I'm not sold on Biggio leading off, but we'll leave that alone. And why bat Ausmus ahead of Everett? Why? Everett hit .256/.320/.380. Ausmus hit .229/.303/.292. How Ausmus drove in 47 runs is beyond me. He probably hit a 30 or 40 weak RBI groundouts to second base with Bagwell, Berkman and Hidalgo all on base.   Now then, back to sleeping on the couch while it snows all night. Oh, the parents locked me out of my own apartment tonight. I get home from work and this is what I have to put up with? Sheesh.

Today will be my first full day here, and I'm already set to do very little - they've got a great book collection at my hostel, and you can hear the river from my dorm room.  Ah, sweet laziness...  I can basically stay here for up to a week, too - I'm flying out of Vienna on Fri Mar 12.  Plus they have free internet at my place, so I can dominate the baseball draft tomorrow.  Well, I have to go do nothing, so I better get to it.  Later.

						   Quick note about Beltran before I get back to studying for my test in an hour.    Kent and Hidalgo are scheduled to make $20.5 million combined this year.  Their options for 2005 are $9 million and $15 million, respectively.  My point...McLane just needs to bone up and spend some more money this next offseason.    So here's my ideal offseason.  You sign Berkman and Oswalt to 4 year deals...maybe backload them just a little bit...you know, for when Bagwell's contract is finally off the books.  You could probably get each for $10 million/year each.  Berkman's already making $6.5 million this year, so that jump don't represent a lot more.  Oswalt's not making shit this year, so that would be a big jump.  But say that's like $13 million / year increase for the two combined.  Who's to say they can't be had for a little cheaper??  Then you just pony up and sign Beltran.  I don't care how...JUST DO IT!  Otherwise, our offense is gonna suck in a few years.  If you pay Beltran $15 million / year, then you've increased payroll about $28 million for these 3 players.  But you got then after dropping over $20 million in payroll in Kent and Hidalgo (who's options for the year would've cost $24 million).  So who would you rather have:  Kent and Hidalgo for one more year at $24 million, or Oswalt, Berkman, and Beltran locked up to long-term deals for an increase of $28 million to payroll.  One more thing I forgot...I believe we only signed Clemens for a year.  If I'm correct, that's another $5 million we no longer have on the books next year.  My final point:  the money's going to be there if McLane will just be willing to spend it.  And I can't remember the last really good, YOUNG player that we've signed...I think we're due.  That is all.

						   OK Jack, maybe the Italian wine has gotten to you. Maybe you've eaten one too many Belgian waffles. Or maybe it's the stinky cheese.   We are not letting go of Bagwell. I hate to put a damper on your (wet) dreams about Carlos Beltran, but Bagwell is staying here until his contract is up. If the Astros were to trade him, it would spark a collective uproar from the city of Houston, kinda like when the Oilers decided to pack it up. It would turn too many fans off, myself included. The team would lose thousands in ticket sales. Trading Bagwell would go against everything the team has done in the past decade. Clemens signed because he liked how the organization treated their players: with respect. Sure, Bagwell would probably like to play for his childhood team, but between then and now he has helped redefine another.  As much as it pains me to say it, Bagwell and his disgustingly-backloaded salary will be with us. True, we might field a better team if we traded him and signed Beltran. But the heart of Houston baseball lies in Bagwell's funky stance, shaggy beard and corkscrew swing.   I completely agree with you that we need to sign our young stars. But I would almost say that signing Berkman might be more important than signing Oswalt or Miller. Why? Our pitching is in good shape for years to come. It's weird, though... we don't have good "prospects" because ours are all major-league ready. Hell, our AAA team could contend with some of baseball's weaker teams. We could have Duckworth, Robertson, Hernandez, Fernandez, Buchholz, AND Saarloos at New Orleans next year.   We have Pettitte signed through 2006, and Redding will be an Astro at least until 2005. With all our pitchers in AAA (I rate Buchholz higher than anyone here), Our staff won't be obliterated if we lose Oswalt and/or Miller. Clearly we should sign at least one of them, and clearly Oswalt is the better of the two.   Oswalt has one more year of eligibility left. If he has a campaign similar to 2002, he'll probably win a $6 to $7 million deal through arbitration in 2005. If we offered him a longer contract this year, what kind of deal should he get? I'd be fine with a 3- or 4-year deal worth $10 million a year.   Our line-up, as Jack pointed out, will have a much different look, as Biggio, Kent and Hidalgo all exit. Burke and Lane PALE in comparison to Kent and Hidalgo offensively. We will have Berkman through 2005, but signing him to a long-term deal (4 years, $40 million?) will be well worth the price. Having him, Ensberg and Lane as the staples of the franchise will be a solid middle-of-the-lineup trio.   I read a story on astros.com that management was reluctant to sign Berkman to a long-term deal mostly because of recent disasters in that area (Hidalgo). This scares me. True, Hidalgo did let himself go after his 2000 campaign, and started to look more and more like Fatty Ward in 2001-2. Despite last year's performance, he has hurt the team financially with his burdensome contract more than his bat has helped.   Still, this shouldn't dissuade G-Hun and D-Mac to look into a long contract for Berkman. Berkman seems to be more inspired and more excited about playing. Plus he's a hometown boy, and could become the next Bagwell as the premier Astro slugger.   Back to Beltran.... who else will be in the market for him? Seems to me the Wicked Witches of the East might already have centerfielders, in Lofton, Damon and Cameron. I know Cameron just signed a 3-year deal... how long are Lofton and Damon signed for? The other team that comes to mind is L.A. They have the resources and dire need for offense. Tha A's would gladly take him if they could afford him. And I bet the White Sox will take a look at him after they get rid of Magglio.   I say, forget Beltran. Let's get PEDRO.

He's a switch hitter who is actually good from both sides. He's tremendous defensively (+13 Cedeno number). He has one of the highest SB% success rates OF ALL TIME.

						   Defense matters in baseball.  I do not mention it very often, statheads do not seem to care about it....but we do actually, it is just hard to measure.  I was surfing through baseball blogs the other day, and I found one that has combined pretty much every advanced defensive metric into one, which he calls the Cedeno Number, because he is a Mets fan and Roger Cedeno is absolutely horrible defensively.  So without further ado, the 2004 Astros, except for Brad Ausmus, it does not measure catchers, and their respective Cedeno numbers, courtesy of  urlLink The Raindrops  blog...  1B  Jeff Bagwell             -3 2B  Jeff Kent                  0 SS  Adam Everett         +12 3B  Morgan Ensberg      +12 LF  Lance Berkman        +4 CF  Craig Biggio             -7 RF  Richard Hidalgo        +15  Total                            +33  Conclusions?  The main thing that jumps out at me is how good Morgan Ensberg was defensively.  Everyone knows how good Adam Everett is, and Hidalgo has an absolute cannon for an arm, but look at Ensberg!  Ok, pardon me while I get on my soapbox....  I CANNOT BELIEVE WE WAITED THIS LONG TO GIVE MORGAN ENSBERG THE FULL TIME THIRD BASE JOB.  Quick, name the last three Astros to get the majority of at bats at third base.  2000  Chris Truby     772 OPS 2001  Vinny Castilla   812 OPS 2002  Geoff Blum      807 OPS  Morgan Ensberg is already 27, and he just put up a 900 OPS and excellent defensive season.  I am absolutely positive that he could have done as well, if not better, than all of these guys in the last three years.  At a reduced price, too.  So here is my point - you gotta play your prospects.  Sometimes you want them to take their time, but when you do not have much else at that position, and they are not getting any younger....DO IT!  Let them play.  They need the experience.  It is the rare Pujols that can just come in to the majors and dominate.  Most young guys need some at bats.  It seems like the Astros are much more willing to bring up young pitchers, Oswalt Miller Redding Hernandez, than hitters....Ensberg is already 27, Everett is 27, Buck is already 25...I think the organization is a little over cautions when it comes to position prospects.  Some times, you just gotta let them play instead of getting a more expensive veteran.  I hope we let Ensberg, Everett, Burke and Buck all start next year, even if they struggle a bit...we can spend the money elsewhere....resign Berkman, Oswalt, and go after Beltran.  The approach of bringing up young players has certainly worked with the pitchers that I mentioned...I do not see why the same should not hold true for position prospects.  My two cents.

						   I had a little chat with JT last night, and we both came to the following conclusion...  ASTROS SIGN BELTRAN!  If you read my article from yesterday, you will see that I decided we did not have enough money to spend on Beltran.  And that is partially true.  But there might be a way to do it...by trading Jeff Bagwell to the Boston Red Sox.  Why does this work?    1.  Bagwell is from the Boston area.  He grew up cheering for the Red Sox.  He has said that he dreams about playing in Fenway Park.  He wants to do it.  2.  Bagwell can DH in the AL, and he can still dominate at the plate.  His main fault now is his fielding, where he can not throw the ball from first to home.  He can still put up a 900 OPS in his sleep.  Bagwell is set to absolutely rake in the dough the next few years, so I am sure we will have to take on some of his salary, or take on an expensive Red Sox player, but most of their players are up for free agency next year anyway.  So maybe we keep paying Bagwell 7 million a year, find some cheap 1B or shift Berkman to 1B and find some cheap LF, either position is easy to find a cheap decent hitter, and then we have at least 15 million a year to spend EVEN AFTER signing Berkman and Oswalt....so we call up Scott Boras and offer Beltran a 5 year 75 million dollar contract....CMON BELTRAN, MORE THAN VLADI!!!!  He has to do it.  He must do it.  This must happen...am I dreaming?  Oh sweet Beltran....come to me...  2005 Astros  CF  Carlos Beltran 3B  Morgan Ensberg LF  Lance Berkman RF  Jason Lane 1B  Travis Lee, Jeremy Giambi, Jay Gibbons, Brad Wilkerson, Adam Dunn, Xavier Nady, Matt Stairs C  John Buck 2B  Chris Burke SS  Adam Everett  Cmon, JT, you gotta admit, that would be beast.  I am bringing it.

						   Ok, ok, I know this is looking ahead a bit, but after Roy Oswalt, outduels Pedro Martinez in Game 7 of the 2004 World Series, bringing home our first World Series to Houston....what do we do in 2005?  The Astros have positioned themselves to go down the crapper in the next few years, for a few reasons:  1.  Not many prospects.  2.  Deferred money in Bagwell, Kent, Pettitte contracts.  Whatever happens, the 2005 offseason will be a defining year for the franchise.  We'll have the opportunity to let a lot of players go.  Here's a rough draft of what could happen, position by position:  C - John Buck / Brad Ausmus (Ausmus is making 3 million in 2005.......UGH) 1B - Jeff Bagwell (13 million) 2B - probably Chris Burke (14 million option for Jeff Kent....he'll be 38....I don't think so) SS - Adam Everett  3B - Morgan Ensberg (gotta love that cheap left side of the infield) LF - Lance Berkman (I really, really hope we sign Lance to something like a 4 year, 40 millon dollar deal....he's not the type of player to age really well, but he'll only be 28, and he should put up 900+ OPS seasons for the next 3/4 years) CF - ? RF - Jason Lane (Lane has said he can play CF too....hopefully we'll find out this year)  SP - Roy Oswalt (like Lance, I hope we re-sign him....in a way, it's important that the Astros have an identity after losing Biggio and eventually Bagwell...I think that Berkman and Oswalt are the two best players to represent our franchise for the next few years....his best comparable is Tim Hudson, who isn't getting any worse...maybe a 4 year 36 million dollar deal?)  SP - Andy Pettitte (about 9 million I think) SP - Tim Redding SP - Carlos Hernandez SP - Brandon Duckworth / Kirk Saarloos / Taylor Bucholz /   Bullpen  Brad Lidge Ricky Stone Mike Gallo some other cheap guys.  So the most obvious place to upgrade, I think would be OF or bullpen.  We should have a pretty decent staff as long as we re-sign either Oswalt or Miller (please Oswalt!)  In my opinion it's not worth spending much money on your bullpen - whoever isn't the 5th starter can jump in there or we can bring up some guys....whatever.  So assuming we re-sign Berkman for 10 mil (no deferred money!) and Oswalt for 9 mil (no deferred money, dammit!), that brings us to 44 mil...everyone else combined costs about....um...10/15 mil.....so that puts us at 55/60 mil.  Which, finally, brings me to this: Can we make a run for Carlos Beltran?  Ultimately, I don't think so.  He'll be too hotly pursued by other teams, and he's a bit overrated in real-life, compared to fantasy.  Don't get me wrong, he's 26 and damn good and he'd be a perfect fit, but someone's gonna give him a Vladi-type contract and I don't think he's worth that.  So let's see we've got 10 mil to spend on improving the OF.  What do we do?  Who are the OF free agents in 2005?  Glad you asked:  The other 'big name' OFers availabe besides Beltran are  Garret Anderson.  Consistent.  Overrated.  Consistently overrated.  He's a good fantasy player, but his .300 average hides his unwillingness to take a walk and his 100 RBI's are a product of the fact that he never misses a game.  Magglio Ordonez.  I didn't realize he was 30 already.  Hasn't improved in the last 3 or 4 years.  Pass.  In my opinion, we should go after younger, cheaper guys.  Here a few suggestions:  Jay Gibbons Brad Wilkerson Adam Dunn Jason Michaels Michael Cuddyer Termell Sledge (what a name!  The SledgeHammer!)

						   Mark Prior is hurt.   Well, he's only out 5-10 days with an inflamed Achilles, but he said in an interview it has been bothering him since late last year, when (you might recall) he threw approximately 25674.29 pitches a game in the last few weeks of the season.  I want to be kind of happy about this; I'm an Astros fan, first and foremost.  But Prior is the kind of player you really don't want to get injured (especially if I have the 4th pick in fantasy baseball this year.)  No, seriously, I hope Mark Prior is ok.  He's probably the best pitcher in baseball right now, and he's 23 years old.  He's got a chance to be one of the best ever, and you don't want to see someone with that much potential get hurt.    By an anonymous poster at BPrimer:   "Well, does it hurt?" he asked. The young matador/hurler gazed at the hills made of white elephants. "Some," he said. He poured whiskey on his cornflakes, and ate, ignoring the pain. An hour passed.  Agitated, Dusty asked him again about his sore leg. Silence. Then,  "I don't suppose it'll stop me from fishing. I know you like to fish." "Yes, but this isn't ordinary fishing. We're going after Marlin. Not easy to take down." A dull wind listlessly whispered, and the young hurler thought back to the previous fall.  "I might need 10 days, to rest up. It's a big challenge." The old man read the pain in the young hurler's eyes. He thought of the sea. "It'll go fast." Silence.  "Perhaps." "Better go get some rest."  The young hurler stared at the desert horizon. He would pitch again. Maybe many, many times. But the innocence was lost forever.

						   A sports writer here at work was a good buddy of Chris Burke's back at the U of Tennessee. This guy says Burke is the hardest-working athlete he'd ever met, and that his attitude and desire to play will impress. Sound familiar?   From what little I've heard / read about him, Burke seems like the second-coming of Biggio. His stats say the same: He hits well, has lots of speed but little power. Last year at Round Rock:  165/549, 3 HR, 41 RBI 57 BB, 57 K, 34/44 SB  Based on my crude calculations, he hit  .301 / .366 / .388 = .754 OPS  Yeah, he should probably bulk up to hit for more power. But that's not a bad start for a 23-year-old second baseman.

						   To football for a second....  I'm reading here on ESPN.com how the trade between the Denver Broncos and the Washington Redskins has just been completed.  Denver hands over Clinton Portis for Champ Bailey and a second round pick.  Apparently Portis will now become the highest paid running back EVER!  So let's have a "unresearched, off the top of my head" gander at the teams, shall we?  We all remember how FRIGGIN' FANTABULOUS Portis was during the regular season and now he's in Washington with the new coach, Joe Gibbs.  For now, Trung Canidate will serve as backup (where he BELONGS!!!) with another fella by the name of Cartwright coming in as the goal-line back.  Wuh oh....did I say "goal-line" back?  If you are involved in fantasy football then you have just said the following three words:  Crappy Crap Crap!!!  However, I don't think that Gibbs would take Portis out once they get inside the 10 or 20.  Portis has proven himself to be solid inside the red zone (and any other point on the field) so I don't think there's anything to worry about and I'm predicting that Portis will have another solid year....notice the word "solid"?  I don't see him having any five touchdown games in Washington, at least not this year.  Although, we shouldn't forget that Portis also had 38 catches for 314 yards along with his 1591 yards rushing...an underrated asset for a RB that will certainly interest Joe Gibbs.  But what about the Redskins' passing game?  As we should all know by now, they've recently signed Mark Brunell as their starting QB...a solid pocket passer in a supposed "protect the QB" system of Joe Gibbs.  They've got solid wide recievers in Laveranues Coles, Rod Gardner and Darnerian McCants so they're not really lacking there.  The HUGE thing that the Redskins need to do (besides introduce Joe Gibbs back into the current day NFL) is focus on that PITIFUL OFFENSIVE LINE!!!  I'm surprised Patrick Ramsey is still alive!  Their defense could use some patchwork as well especially with the loss of Champ Bailey.  Trading away that second pick will probably come back to bite them so they can't look to the draft to solve all of their woes.  I'm not sure about their cap situation but if they have money left they would be wise to snatch any free agent linemen available this offseason.  What about the Broncos?  With Clinton Portis out, I can only assume that the Broncos were damn satisfied with Quentin Griffin.  I was impressed as well when I saw him play; he showed great quickness and some good field vision for a rookie RB.  However, he will need to bulk up a bit since he isn't as powerful a runner as Portis.  This might be a problem since their fullback, Mike Anderson, keeps getting himself suspended for doin' the doobie dance.  As of right now (before the draft and the offseason is over) I'm gonna say that the Broncos' running game will be at best mediocre....nothing that would keep an opposing head coach awake at night.  They've got some decent WR's in Rod Smith, Shannon Sharpe and Ashley Lelie, although the only consistent one among them is Sharpe and he's gettin' up there in the age department.  Sadly, he's their best reciever so don't be surprised if they take a WR early in the draft.  Their defense was pretty solid last season, if I remember correctly, and the new additions (Champ Bailey) will only strengthen it.  Jake, The Mistakey Shaky Snake, is finally able to be a good QB (and a half-mobile one at that!) in the Denver offense but lemme just say this....  Denver, get rid of Ed McCaffrey....he's useless and could drop dead any second.  Barstool out.

						   I just read a short article on yahoo.com that said blogging has yet to really take off.  And, honestly, it might be for the best.  Case in point: I spent the past hour or so trying to find every baseball blog that I could.  And some of them were pretty good.  But not that many.  A lot were pretty similar, mostly focused around a single team, and a lot included statistical analysis, which is kind of boring to read about.  ....Gulp.  So, long story short, there is a LOT of stuff being written about baseball out there, so I really need to stay on top of current events, but (at the same time) write about what appeals to me, because I simply can't compete with ESPN, BPro, or BPrimer.    The one thing that I also noticed is that most of these other baseball blogs mainly talked about baseball.  I mean, I love baseball, and I love talking about it, and analzying it, but I need a break from it every now and then (and the season hasn't started yet!)  So I'm definitely going to keep writing about life in general, and hopefully JT, Andy, and Barstool will too.  I'm off.

						   I'm all set to take an overnight bus trip to Prague in the Czech Republic (where I will stay in a youth hostel that is also a boat) but first: baseball.  Ok, ok, I know I keep saying this, but....Baseball Prospectus kicks major @§§.  One of their new methods of analysis is Team Health Reports, which is really cool to read about, because it's yet another new way to think about improving a team: eliminate those pesky injuries!  If the Astros have Roy Oswalt and Jeff Kent all last year, we win the Central.  But injuries happen, you can't really prevent them, it's part of the game...NO!  I mean, well, sometimes.  But not all the time.  Why do some teams (Oakland) never seem to have injuries?  Well, Mulder last year, but other than that, Hudson Zito Chavez Tejada....none of those guys ever seemed to miss any time.  It's not just luck, and it's not as simple as "throw fewer pitches."  There's work to be done on injuries, and Prospectus is DOING IT.  Oh, and everyone should check out their Baseball Prospectus Basics articles, which basically got me hooked on sabermetrics.  They talk about why a strikeout isn't much worse than a regular out, why closers are overrated...read it.  Most of the news that I've been reading about the Astros lately involves how Pettitte and Clemens are leading by example in Spring Training, encouraging all the other pitchers to get up early, work out more, and get in better shape.  I love this.  Especially from a guy like Clemens, who has been an excellent pitcher in the major leagues for nearly as long as I have been alive.  And he's still damn good.  If he can impart a little of what he's learned over the years, it could really benefit our young pitchers, especially Wade Miller and Tim Redding, who have the stuff, but not the consistency or attitude.  And so far it seems to be working - Miller has shown up at Spring Training looking more muscular and chiseled, and Redding has vowed to do whatever Clemitte tells him too.    I kinda changed my mind about trading Jeriome Robertson for Brian Roberts.  Roberts isn't really very good, Chris Burke should be ready in 2005, and there's gotta be some team willing to give us more for Robertson.  So far, Berlin's  Tiergarten  wins the award for best park, edging out London's  Hyde Park  and  Regent Park , and way better than Amsterdam's  Museumplein .   boo bye!

						   A rainout yesterday delayed Tim Redding's start.  Roy Oswalt will start today and Andy Pettitte (finally!) will make his 2nd start as an Astro on Thursday, with Redding available to serve in long relief for either (probably Pettitte's) start.  This got me to thinking - Redding's got great stuff...I wonder if he'd be better suited as a reliever?    The answer: NO.    Well, at least from the numbers that I'm looking at.  For pitches 1-15, Tim has a 6.99 ERA and a 1.51 WHIP.  For pitches 16-30, he's got a 6.29 ERA and a 1.56 WHIP.  From then on, he's solid, especially pitches 46-90.    Again, sample size issues, but generally speaking, it looks it takes Redding a little while to 'get into' a game and settle down.  Maybe he needs to prepare better, maybe he should warm up in the bullpen a little more...but whatever it is, he struggles in his first 30 pitches of his average start.  Most of my friends (except  urlLink this guy ) are done with school in the next week or two, which means it's been A WHOLE YEAR since I graduated from Vanderbilt.  Man, that year went by fast.  But apparently I can't get enough education, since I sent in my contract as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, AZ yesterday.  I'll be taking Statistics courses and teaching entry-level College Algebra, well on my way to becoming a major-league GM.  Stat-heavy major league GMs: Beane, Ricciardi, Epstein, DePodesta...Wade?  Gimme a few years...  It's all tennis all the time this week, as I've got lessons, matches, and a tournament this weekend.  So if I'm not here, I'm probably at the WAC, teaching/playing/sleeping.  We need this series against the Pirates, especially with the way the Cubs have been playing without Prior.  Well, at least until they ran into the buzzsaw that is the Arizona Diamondbacks.  Thanks, Randy Johnson and Brandon Webb, for holding the Cubs to 1 run in their last 18 innings.

						   Tough losses for two Houston teams last night, as the Astros wasted a great pitching performance by Wade Miller in losing to the Rockies 4-1, and the Rockets let a 4 point lead slip away in OT against the Lakers.  The Astros just couldn't get much going against Joe Kennedy, a control lefty who was less than impressive as the Devil Rays' #1 starter last year.  So of course he comes to Colorado and starts...dominating??  I don't think so.  We just didn't have it yesterday, and there was a HUGE strike zone in effect (for both pitchers, to be fair.)  Morgan Ensberg hit the ball hard 3 times; he missed a HR to right field by about 10 feet, then lined out sharply to RF with 2 runners on, then lined out to LF.  He's coming around.  Miller looked pretty darn good, throwing an easy 93-94 on the corners with an occasional NASTY curveball that breaks really, really hard.  The only runs he gave up came on some cheap end-of-the-bat singles by Castilla and Burnitz and a solo HR by Mark Sweeney.  Then Brad Lidge came on, gave up 2 runs, but Brandon Backe pitched well to not allow any more, but our offense just couldn't do anything today.  Ken Rosenthal's latest  urlLink article  mentions the Astros in several places.  First:    "Astros 1B Jeff Bagwell can barely throw because of the condition of his right shoulder, leaving him vulnerable to bunts and to baserunners who invite pickoff throws and then take off for second, forcing Bagwell to handle the ball. Astros 2B Jeff Kent, meanwhile, is "worse than I've ever seen him defensively, no question," according to one scout. "He's never been great, but his reactions, his range . . . he's very unsure of himself."   I'm going to have to agree with both of these points.  Bagwell really can't throw at all, and it's eventually going to cost us runs.  Kent has never been good defensively, but he has looked truly scared out there a few times this year, like he doesn't know what he's doing.  He's gotta get going, both offensively and defensively.  Second:  "The Astros can't count on help from Class AAA LHP Carlos Hernandez, who is recovering from shoulder surgery. "He's a shell of what he once was, throwing 82-86 mph," a scout says. "He's not ready at all." The same scout raves about Class AAA Taylor Buchholz, whom the Astros acquired in the Billy Wagner trade. "He could definitely contribute this year if somebody went down," the scout says. "He's like a big-league guy in waiting."   From everything I've heard about Hernandez, this is true.  His velocity IS way down.  And I don't know exactly how you re-learn an extra 5-10 mph on your fastball.  He may not ever be the same pitcher he was.  I'm glad this guy likes Bucholz, but some other guys (Chad Qualls, DJ Houlton, Ezequiel Astacio) have put up even better numbers in the minors so far this year.  On the flip side, we have very few good position prospects.  Todd Self, a 1B at AA Round Rock, has been going crazy, hitting 381/512/571 with 18 walks and 8 extra base hits in 63 AB.  John Buck, C, has been solid offensively (321/379/453 in a pitcher's park) but has made 6 errors in 16 games, and Chris Burke, 2B, is cut from the Adam Everett mold - good defense, no power whatsoever.  I'm all for youth, but an offense of   Buck Bagwell Burke Everett Ensberg Lane CF Berkman  is asking for trouble next year.  I really think we've gotta go for it all this year.    Oh, and the Red Sox SWEPT the Yankees at home.  I love it.

						   The Astros have won the first 2 games at Coors Field, 13-7 and 8-5.  I'll just give you a bunch of my impressions:  Brandon Duckworth could eventually be a decent major league pitcher, but it will NOT be in Coors Field (and, unfortunately, probably not Minute Maid Park either).  He simply gives up too many fly balls, a fair amount of which turn into the home run variety.  I could see him being an effective starting pitcher in Dodger Stadium or Safeco Field or Pac Bell Park, though.  Craig Biggio is locked in.  His lack of a high leg kick really stops him from pulling off the ball, resulting in tons of line drives to LF.  He looks quick, healthy, and happy.  (Unfortunately, he'll never be an average defensive CF.)  Jeff Bagwell and Lance Berkman, although neither is hitting with consistent power, have unbelievable batting eyes.  I just don't see either one of them having an extended slump - they simply do not chase bad pitches.  Richard Hidalgo crushes the ball often, but sometimes appears TOO patient.  He'll let perfect pitches go by too often.  Similarly, Morgan Ensberg looks a little too patient.  One of the main benefits of good patience at the plate is not only to draw walks but to force the pitcher to make a pitch that you can drive.  Ensberg does that, and often lets the pitch go by.    Jim DeShaies, Astros play-by-play-man, today:  "There have been statistical studies done that suggest that 'protection' in a lineup really doesn't exist."  WELL DONE!  This is absolutely right.  You would think that if you've got Barry Bonds hitting behind you instead of Brad Ausmus, you'll see better pitches, but in reality, this rarely comes into play.  Lineup protection is largely a myth.  Lidge and Dotel are pitching about as well as they can right now.  This means: DO NOT OVERWORK THEM, JIMY.  Save them for when you need them.  Chad Harville is wild.  We can't demote him, and if we release him we admit we traded Saarloos for basically nothing, so he needs to learn some control, and fast.  If you can't hit in Coors, you can't hit anywhere.  Jose Vizcaino and Brad Ausmus will both post sub-650 OPS this year, and probably use up 700 plate appearances doing so.  WHY IS ORLANDO PALMEIRO THE 4TH OUTFIELDER INSTEAD OF JASON LANE???  C.B. Buckner is a terrible, inconsistent umpire.  Ok, enough random Astros tidbits. It's been a good few games for the Astros, all in all, and it's been a good weekend for me, as I found out I got into U. of Hawaii for grad school, even though I'm probably not going to go there.  Still, it's nice to get accepted.

						   I'm really frustrated now.   Brad Ausmus went to Dartmouth.  He's a smart guy, a nice guy, and I bet if I met at Kroger I would like him.  But if he can't even get a throw to 2nd base on a pitch out, why is he on the team?  Why is he in the major leagues?  Oh, right, to ground into game-ending double plays.  It's not fair to put all the blame on Ausmus.  The entire offense was pretty bad tonight.  It was one of those make-an-average-pitcher-look-dominant nights that the offense seems to have a little too often.  Roy Oswalt is currently the best pitcher in baseball. Brad Lidge and Octavio Dotel both looked awesome.  But our defense sucks, Morgan Ensberg looks like someone is using him as a hand puppet at the plate, we're swinging at everything...  And we have the worst catcher in baseball.

						   Why, oh why, do so many people want tennis lessons all of a sudden?  Is it the emergence of Andy Roddick, the guy with a 150mph serve and a shoulder that can't last that much longer?  Could it be the eventual decline of Zen Master Andre Agassi, who is saving himself for one last hurrah?  Or perhaps Anna Kournikova might still win that elusive singles title?  Anyway, quit bugging me so much about tennis lessons.  So I promised to do a little story about a friend of a friend who's a great prospect for the Braves.  The friend is Derek, and the friend of a friend is Jeff Francoeur:  Says Baseball Prospectus:  2003: "Selected by the Braves with 23rd overall pick in 2002, Francoeur got a $2.2 million bonus, the biggest the Braves had ever given.  He then went to the Appalachian League and tore it up, inspiring comparisons to Dale Murphy.  We'll have to see more before we'll sign on to something like that, but he hasn't yet ruled it out."  2004: "Francoeur didn't overwhelm the league in his full-season debut at Rome, but for a guy who played mostly football in high school, it was an impressive start.  His power and wheels are for real, and the scouting reports on his defesns are better than the DTs would suggest.  He'll need to learn how to handle breaking pitches, and improve his approach at the plate in general, but he's got time.  According to David Camerson, who studies these things extensively, Francoeur also has the hottest girlfriend in the entire minor leauges."  Derek could probably tell you more about this guy, but from what I remember, he's just a natural athlete.  I think he played...cornerback?  safety?  in high school.  Maybe Derek will correct me on that.  But yeah, he's gonna be good.  And he's 20 years old.    The Astros lost 5-3 last night; Miller only gave up 5 hits and a walk in 6 innings, but 2 HR's.  Lance Berkman had all 3 RBIs but Hidalgo and Ensberg went a combined 0-for-7 and a late double switch by Jimy backfired as Jose Vizcaino booted a grounder to 3B which led to 2 runs.    Tonight: Tim Redding vs. Matt Morris  Tim needs a solid start.  To his credit, he hasn't looked frustrated or angry yet this year, despite some defensive lapses behind him.  There have been whispers of arm trouble surrounding Morris, and his velocity is down.  We should do some damage.  Tomorrow I'm going to try and convince my brother to write up a little summary of his latest ultimate frisbee tournament, because it's incredible.

						   Jack's back.  A lot happened while I was at a wedding (my first ever) in Florida - the Astros won the last 3 games of their series against the Brewers, with Roy and Roger dominating and the offense going crazy for one game.  And we traded college pitcher and minor league pitcher extraordinaire Kirk Saarloos to the Oakland A's for Chad Harville.    Unfortunately for both Kirk and the Astros, it seemed like this was inevitable.  I think people have forgotten how good this guy was in the minors:   18-3, 190 IP, 175 K, 41 BB, 7 HR, 1.99 ERA.  That is simply awesome.  He hasn't been great in the majors, but he hasn't been painfully bad, either, and I can't see why a 25 year old with those minor league career stats can't eventually be a succesful major league pitcher.  As for Harville, Andy reminded me that we had seen him in the bullpen on our road trip, but I still don't remember him, so I'm going to have to break out the old copies of Baseball Prospectus Annuals.  Here's what they have to say about Harville:   2002:  He's a small right-hander who can flat-out bring heat...often called a right-handed Billy Wagner, but that's overstating the case...has the stuff to be a closer in the bigs.  2003:  Once called "The Right-Handed Billy Wagner" because of his diminutive stature and vicious fastball, Harville's been struggling with injuries and mechanics.  2004:  The whole right-handed Billy Wagner thing just hasn't worked out...He still throws very hard, but didn't look completely comfortable with his improving curveball...he's still a reasonable bet to be a good pitcher in some role.  GM Gerry Hunsicker also said today in the paper that the team had considered drafting Harville in 1997 in the 1st round, but went with Lance Berkman instead (good choice!).  I think maybe this is a case of seeing a guy as you would like to see him - yep, he was dominant in college, and occasionally great in the minors, but Harville has struggled in the majors.  Sound like anyone?  Although Harville and Saarloos pitch nothing alike (Harville brings the heat, Saarloos can't throw over 85mph), they've both had success at the collegiate/minor league level, but it hasn't translated well to the bigs.  Harville has had more injury trouble, and is older than Saarloos (27 to 25).  All in all, I gotta give this trade a thumbs up...for the A's.  They were getting ready to have to drop Harville because they had a full 25-man roster and he had refused demotion.  Saarloos could definitely be a solid back-of-the-rotation starter for the A's for a few years - maybe he was rushed to the majors, or maybe he just needs to be put in a role and left there for a whole year instead of being jerked around.  Either way, although this trade might help us this year, I don't like it long-term.  I think we could have gotten more (say, a C or OF prospect?) for Saarloos.  Harville has immediately been placed on the 25-man roster, with Eric Bruntlett sent down to make room.  Andy Pettitte's just about back from the DL, which means we have to send someone down to AAA.  I'd recommend Duckworth, because I still think he fits in better as a future starter - he gives up a few too many HRs for a reliever.  Put him in AAA for a year and maybe he'll make a great #5 starter next year.  That would leave us with Dotel/Lidge/Miceli/Harville/Stone/Gallo/Backe, which I like.  No spot-starter/long-relief guy, but with 7 relievers, I think it's all right.  Just don't use Harville or Lidge for too long - both those guys have injury history.    Anyway, back to the team on the field.  We're looking really good.  Our offense can't keep this up, obviously, but if Biggio continues to drive the ball (10 extra-base hits!), Bagwell and Berkman keep drawing walks, Hidalgo keeps ripping up, and Ensberg finally gets it going (which he will - he's done it at every level, over time), we should have ourselves a very solid offense.  Ausmus and Everett will almost certainly regress, but that's to be expected.  Our bench has actually looked ok, at least from the Lane and Palmeiro point of view.  Raul Chavez isn't going to hurt anybody, Mike Lamb is a butcher in the field but has some pop, and Jose Vizcaino is batting .077 / .143 / .154 with 3 K's in 11 AB's.  Can't win 'em all...  Tonight:  Wade Miller vs.  Jeff Suppan.  Watch for a 'hangover' from Miller after throwing 121 pitches last start.  Tomorrow: An article about a friend of a friend who might just be the next great Braves outfielder.

						   Sorry for the delay, but a certain someone has been down in Florida at a wedding instead of up in Chicago visiting his little brother.   The big news from the weekend: Astros take 3 of 4 from the Brew Crew, with Oswalt and Clemens leading the charge with tremendous outings. Last night, Clemens threw 7 amazing innings (although he did give up his first run of the year) and even got his second career RBI.   The even bigger news of the weekend came courtesy of the Oakland Athletics: The Stros acquired fireballer Chad Harville for crafty control expert Kirk Saarloos. I'll leave the in-depth analysis to Jack, but I think this could be a huge trade for us right now.   Yes, Saarloos could end up being a terrific starting pitcher in a few years, but both the Astros and I ran out of patience for him. He's been in and out of the majors for 3 years now, and he has yet to impress. And he really hasn't looked good so far this Spring.   Jack and I saw Chad Harville during our baseball road trip through California last summer. I can't say he was incredible (in fact, I can't remember how he did), but I remember how excited everyone was to see him. Jack pointed him out to me when he started throwing in the bullpen, and said he was a tremendous prospect.   His numbers aren't great from last year, but I've heard good things about him. Plus he's got a new change-up to compliment his 95 mph fastball, his curve and his slider. I can definitely see him joining LIdge and Dotel as this year's big three. And I like how we got him on the 25-man roster immediately. Shows confidence in the man. Let's just hope his injuries are behind him.  Eric Bruntlett was sent down to make room, and he deserved it. When you aren't any better than Jose Vizcaino, there's something wrong.   Oh yeah, somehow we missed the move, but Jared Fernandez was sent down last Tuesday for Mike Gallo, who becomes our only lefty pitcher (until Pettitte comes back, that is). Sure, Jared has sorta sucked this year, but I don't think one bad outing should condemn his entire season. I hope we see Jared again real soon. Then again, Gallo got the job done last year and should be a good option.   Next up: a day off Monday to get fired up for our second series against the Redbirds in as many weeks. Last time we swept, outscoring the Cardinals 26-9. The matchups:  Miller v Suppan  Redding v Carpenter  Oswalt v Morris  Get pumped.

						   Oswalt's line: 9 IP, 3 H, 0 BB, 0 R, 10 K.    Damn good. And only 94 pitches! More importantly, he figured out how to get Junior Spivey out. That guy was owning us.   The offense was stagnant at times. We compiled 8 hits and 5 walks but could only manage 2 runs.   I hear Duckworth is starting tomorrow. He's been pitching better each outing, so maybe he can show his stuff here against a gritty but not overwhelming Brewers club.   I'm off to Purdue in the first stage of the spring college ultimate series. Illinois is going down.

						   What impressed me most from today's 10-5 win over St. Louis was our bullpen. Fernandez's knuckler just wasn't knuckling, and Jimy had to pull him after serving up 4 runs and only recording one out (which reminds me of a late season start by Mr. Robertson). Duckworth calmed the Cardinals' bats, and though he wasn't at all dominant, he was able to finesse his way through the fourth.   I can't figure out Duckworth. When I first heard about the Wagner trade, I thought Brandon was the prize jewel. After researching his stats, Jack discovered that he dominated when he was allowed to start. His ERA was about 2 runs higher out of the bullpen than as a starter. Obviously, there was little room for him to start for the Astros, but I kept hoping he'd fit into a long-relief-slash-spot-starter role.   Both Jack and I have been amazed at his drop in velocity this Spring. I was under the impression he could throw in the mid- to upper-90's. And his 167 K's in 163.0 IP back in 2002 as a starter for the Phils meant he is capable of good stuff. But he hasn't been reaching 90 in most of his fastballs, and until tonight, he really hadn't had good command of his off-speed pitches.   Miceli is another mystery to me. I can't figure out why in the world we have him in the first place. He's never had good numbers, and he's never been able to stick with a team. Yet he pitched well for us down the stretch last year, and has been decent so far this year. He gave us a couple solid innings tonight, but I'm still reluctant to use him in games when we need to hold onto the lead.   Ricky Stone, meanwhile, looked awesome tonight. He worked a near-perfect 7th, giving up a hit on what should have been ruled an error by Ensberg. Stone had great control tonight, and I think he really has the experience to become a terrific finesse pitcher. Think Rheal Cormier. Or Brendan Donnelly. He's not gonna blow you away, but can paint every edge and change speeds on you. I think he should be the leading candidate to claim the seventh inning before Lidge and Dotel.   Speaking of whom, the firemen were lights out again tonight. Lidge was perfect, and Dotel fought some control issues but was able to close the door.   Is it just me, or do Biggio and Everett seem a lot more aggressive on the basepaths? Biggio stretched a single to short right-center into a double (with blinding speed!) and Everett stole his second base. Those two could wreak some havoc on the basepaths (maybe Bidge can teach AE a thing or two about running?). Everett is growing on me.   Also, Bags looked bad tonight. And I'm not talking about his batting (he went 1-for-5 with an RBI and a run). Edmonds hit a sharp single to right with runners on second and third in the second inning. Marlon Anderson scored easily, and Pujols held at third. Bags cut off the throw and had Edmonds caught in a rundown after he rounded first a bit too much. Bags ran after him towards second, but stopped to throw home. Pujols baited the throw by taking off toward home, but returned to third easily since Bags' throw was a loopy floater. Luckily Duckworth worked out of the jam by walking Renteria, but it still looked bad.   When are we going to see the cool trick Bagwell and Hidalgo have been working on? The one where Bags goes back for the pop-up, catches it and flips it to Hidalgo who rifles it to third or home? I've heard so much about it, but I have yet to see it.   Biggio looks good with no leg kick. I saw his new stance in Milwaukee, and he looks a lot more comfortable — especially against breaking balls.   Is Jason Lane an especially good defensive CF? So why is Jimy putting him in for defense but still refuses to let him bat? Today's scenario: Top 8th. Up by two. Bases loaded. One out. Pitcher's spot up. What's the easy call? Get a slugger up there who, if nothing else, can loft a sac fly! Jimy's decision: Jose Vizcaino. Batting right-handed. Viz lifts a weak pop out to shallow right. No insurance run. Good thing Biggio was up next. (Actually, good thing Ray Lankford got hurt. Marlon Anderson had a total of 29 innings at LF in his career, and a decent outfielder would have caught the third out. Anderson dropped Biggio's liner for a 3-run double.)  Tomorrow: Rocket vs. Jeff Suppan.

						   Things looked a lot better today, especially from 6th row seats right at beautiful Miller Park. The stadium is eerily similar to Minute Maid (excuse me — The Juicebox), what with the retractable roof and trying-a-bit-too-hard gimmicks. We got a train, they got a slide. And you can't ride on either.   Oswalt settled down after giving up an early run. He seemed to be having some trouble planting his left foot at first, and even brought the umps out to investigate the mound. But he settled down after the first and pitched well enough although he allowed 10 baserunners in 6 innings. Oh, and that new change up he's been working on looks AWESOME. Seriously. Facing Brady Clark (whom you might recall made the most stupendous defenseive play in all of baseball last year), Oswalt threw a 3-2 change up. Clark ducks out of the way, falling to the ground in terror. Strike 3. End of inning.   Oswalt was hitting 94 consistently with his fastball, 84 with his curve and 69 with his change. Every time. He's got incredible command (although he walked 3 today) and incredible ability to change speeds. And he's confindent enough to throw his new change on full counts.   Oswalt dominated in the batter's box too, hitting a double and a single in three at-bats. He got the big rally started in the 3rd by looping a single over Spivey's head, but was thrown out when Biggio tried to bunt him over. First off, this was a terrible call by Jimy. Biggio can't bunt, Oswalt can't run, and it's the third inning with the big boppers waiting on deck! Why bunt? (Everett also tried to reach base by bunting a couple innings later, but was out by a hair — he looked really fast)   Anyway, after an Everett double, a Bagwell punch out and back to back walks to Kent and Doggy (Doug Davis intentionally walked Hidalgo after going 3-1 on him), Berkman smashes his first career grand slam — Right-handed! Maybe it's just me, but Lance just looks silly batting from the right side. He claims he has more power there, and perhaps he does. But he still has terrible form for an elite outfielder. I'm glad Berkman was able to break out of his slump. He hadn't looked good at the plate yet, and was even demoted to 6th in the lineup.   The new 5-hitter, meanwhile, has been tearing it up. Doggy went 2-3 with two walks on the day. He scared us all in his third at-bat when he glanced a pitch off his left hand. He took a few minutes with the trainer to make sure everything felt alright, and stayed in the game. Frightening scene.   Bagwell, Biggio and Ensberg all had bad days, going 0-for-14. Ensberg made his first error of the year, bobbling a easy grounder. For some reason (probably Jimy's inexplicable dislike for him), Lamb replaced Ensberg in what appeared to be a defensive replacement in the 8th. Lamb also made an error at third, leading to runs in the 9th inning for the Brew Crew.   Brandon Backe, called up after Pettitte's injury, was able to log his first innings as an Astro. Although he gave up a couple runs in the ninth, he looked decent. His curveball looks as good as they say, and he was hitting the high 90s with his gas.  Some other things of note: Biggio still looks lost in centerfield. Junior Spivey (who rocked us with 3 doubles), hit a sharp liner into center. Good defenders would have caught the ball, and decent ones would have at least cut it off. Biggio, however, broke in on the ball too sharply, going for the catch. Realizing he couldn't get to it, he broke back, only to have it skid past him to the wall. Not so good, Bidge.   Oh, and Raul Chavez. Not much to say here, except for his amazing bare-handed grab on a pop bunt from Doug Davis. He ran forward expecting the bunt, but saw it trailing back over his head. He probably had enough time to catch it with his glove, but he reached out and caught it with his right hand instead. Hope it made SportsCenter.   A quick note about the Brewers: they look alright. Considering their payroll, they've fielded a decent team. And how good was that Sexson trade? Overbay himself could hit 30 homers soon, and Spivey, Counsell and Moeller are all decent players.   The Brew Crew actually outhit the Stros today, threatening often but never getting a hit when they needed it. Lyle Overbay struck out three times with a runner on third and fewer than 2 outs. That kills (especially for fantasy).   Hopefully Jimy will see how playing small ball pales in comparison to going for the big inning. We are not a bunting team. We are not fast. We don't have particularly great baserunners (save Bags). We shouldn't be playing small ball.   Most Important Thing: Oswalt. He was able to dominate on a day when he didn't have his best stuff. That's a good sign. He didn't show any ill effects from serving up Bonds' homer in the last pitch of his last start. And his groin didn't seem to bother him. Let's hope Pettitte's injury is the only one we see all year.   Oh, and for those who are wondering, the Polish won the Sausage race.

						   The Astros lost 6-1 to the Brewers yesterday, as Tim Redding was outpitched by Ben Sheets (who has 7 straight wins against the Astros).  The offense didn't do much, but it was partially sabotaged by Jimy, who started Orlando Palmeiro, Jose Vizcaino, and Mike Lamb.  So far Morgan Ensberg, he of the 907 OPS and 25 HRs last year, has started 3/5 of the games.  The other thing that scares me is that the first time Biggio gets a day off his spot goes not to young power hitting Jason Lane but to Orlando Palmeiro, who is not a bad player but makes a better defensive replacement and pinch-hitter.  Jimy needs to recognize that Lane is the 4th OF, NOT Palmeiro.    Here's my Jimy count so far for the year:  Vizcaino at-bats 6 Lamb starts 2  Baseball Prospectus finally got around to covering the Astros in their Team Health Report.  It's premium content, which I paid for, so I think I can give you guys the basics of it, but if you want some great analysis every day, it's worth the 20 bucks a year or so.  Anyway, the only position players to get warnings are Craig Biggio (red), and Bagwell/Kent/Berkman (all yellow).  I was a little surprised that Biggio got such a high chance of injury, but he is 38, playing center field, and generally goes all-out.  Again, an injury to Biggio, while a shame, wouldn't be the worst thing to happen to the club.  The pitching staff looks a lot riskier, with Roy Oswalt, Pettitte, and Clemens all yellow lights and Wade Miller a red light.  I'm surprised Miller got the red, but they suspect a lingering elbow injury.  Oswalt gets the light because of last year's groin injury, and Clemens and Pettitte aren't getting any younger.  In fact, Andy Pettitte just went on the 15 day DL yesterday, apparently due to a slight elbow injury from a CHECK SWING while batting.  That's not easy to do, and I hope he's all right.  He said he was fine in the newspaper today, just that the doctors wanted to be sure, but of course he's going to say that...come back soon, Andy.  We called up Brandon Backe to take his place - kind of a strange move.  I would think we would call up Saarloos or Carlos Hernandez to make Pettitte's start, but instead Jared Fernandez is getting the nod.  After a few games, I don't think Eric Bruntlett or Brandon Duckworth should be on the club right now - Bruntlett is another Vizcaino, and Duckworth doesn't look good and his numbers look worse.  We could call up Hernandez / Saarloos (probably Hernandez...we could use a lefty) and anyone that can play 2B / SS other than Bruntlett (Matranga, Chris Burke, Brooks Conrad).  That's what I'd do.  Little Andy Wade is at the Astros - Brewers game today, which starts at 1:05.  He's already declared he'll have a big write-up, so get ready for that later today.  Oh, and sorry for the delay the last few days - I was playing in a tennis tournament, and I got to the semifinals, where I lost to the 1 seed (and last year's champion) 6-4, 6-3.  Damn.

						   A terrible day for Houston fans.   We lost 6-1 to the Brewers. More importantly, though, the team placed Pettitte on the 15-day DL retroactive to Wednesday. Apparently he strained his elbow on a check swing during BP. Things don't look too serious, but this injury might have some lingering effects.  He'll likely only miss 2 starts, meaning Hernandez, Fernandez, Saarloos or Buchholz will start in his stead.   In this afternoon's game, Ben Sheets did all the talking, striking out 10 in six incredible innings. Palmeiro, Lamb and Viz all started, going a combined 1-11.   Redding's first start was reminiscent of his 2003 campaign: decent, unspectacular, helpless. Redding escaped jams in nearly every inning, allowing 5 hits, 3 walks and 3 runs in 5 innings.  Ricky Stone was not good. The Brewers nibbled at him for 3 more runs in the sixth on a string of singles. Duckworth looked a little better than last night, pitching a perfect eighth inning.   As bad as the Houston pitchers were, our batters were worse. Brad Ausmus had the only decent day, which just about says it all. He had 3 hits, including a triple (!) in the eighth, later scoring on Ensberg's pinch hit sac fly. Bagwell had a pair of hits, Lamb singled, and that was all. Palmeiro, Vizcaino, Kent, Berkman and Hidalgo all put up oh-fers on the day.   Berkman's fourth inning at-bat epitomized Sheets' dominace. Lance worked the count full, then fouled off about 6 tough pitches from Sheets. Sheets never backed down, blowing Berkman away with a 97 mph fastball right down the middle on the 13th pitch of the at-bat. Lance watched the perfect pitch, and walked immediately back to the dugout. It was a bad day for Astros hitters.   Here's hoping Jimy's "experiment" with getting his bench involved doesn't last. I don't think Biggio, Everett or Ensberg are in any way tired or hurt, so there's no reason why they shouldn't be playing. And the 1-2 punch of Palmeiro and Vizcaino is... not good. Ensberg has not started 2 of the Astros' first 5 games, which is slightly alarming.

						   I picked up a copy of  urlLink Baseball Prospectus 2004  the other day, and it's pretty darn good.  A little less creative than it's been in past years, and the article on the Astros is a little dry (they basically slam our farm system and our signings of Viz / Ausmus....well, thanks), but it's still the most entertaining baseball analysis book there is.  And I love baseball books, after all.  Speaking of baseball books, there's a new one coming out soon (April 27, to be exact):  The Bad Guys Won , by Jeff Pearlman.  It's a biography of the '86 Mets, who beat the Astros in an  urlLink unbelievable playoff series .  The book spends a lot of time on the '86 Astros, too, especially Mike Scott, who was the Series MVP (on the losing team!).  There are tons of interviews, stats, trivia...don't take my word for it.   urlLink Check it out .

						   ASTROS WIN, 10-1!!  The first win of the year is always exciting, and we earned this one, with power hitting and awesome starting pitching.  The Good   Roger Clemens dominated.  7 IP, 1 H (a single by Ray Durham), 3 BB (1 intentional to Bonds), and 9 (!!)K's in an efficient 95 pitch performance.  And he looked great, too, throwing an easy 94/95, with a nasty slider, and an absolute fearlessness to pitch inside.  He's the greatest pitcher in the post-WWII era, and he showed why tonight.  Our Top 4 in the batting order (Biggio, Everett, Bagwell, Kent) went a combined 8-for-13 with 2 HR, 3 doubles, 3 walks  , 8 RBI, and 7 runs scored.  I like Biggio's new stance - without the high leg kick, it's a quieter stance, there's less going on, and allows him to make adjustments slightly easier.  I think he should have a pretty solid year - maybe .270 / .375 / .425, for a solid 800 OPS.  Ricky Stone looked great, easily getting 3 straight batters in the 9th.  A front 4 of Dotel / Lidge / Miceli / Stone is pretty darn effective, ESPECIALLY against righties.    Jason Lane got his first AB and flew out to the LF warning track.  He didn't even hit it that well and almost took it out.  He showed good patience, too, not chasing a few close pitches.  He's ready.  Orlando Palmeiro had a great swing on a PH double.  He's like Jose Vizcaino but a whole lot better, and his defense and throwing arm (Andy will remember seeing him make an INCREDIBLE catch in the ivy at Wrigley Field last year) are excellent.  I think he's a pretty good addition, as long as Lane is the 1st PH option.  The Bad  Brad Ausmus looked lost.  He swung as hard as he could at a fastball down the middle...and hit a weak grounder to 3rd.  He also routinely whiffs on fastballs right down the middle of the plate, really cannot pull the ball, and doesn't run well.  There's a reason he put up a 594 OPS in 450 ABs last year - he's not any good.  Lance Berkman is struggling.  His timing is definitely off, although he still has a great eye.  He's 0-for-9 on the year with 3 walks, and I still don't think I've seen him get a ball out of the infield.  Pick it up, Lance.  Eric Bruntlett got a PH AB with the bases loaded and 2 outs and managed a first-pitch weak pop to 2B.  And it looked as bad as it sounds.   We go to Milwaukee on Friday, where the matchups are:  Wade Miller (who is unstoppable at Miller Park) vs. Wes Obermueller Tim Redding vs. Ben Sheets Roy Oswalt vs. Doug Davis.  Let's get those first place Brewers.

						   The Astros lost Game #2 to the Giants, 7-5.  The Good News  We had 15 hits (all singles), and could have had a few more - we hit some line drives right at guys. Dan Miceli looked great, getting two grounders back to the mound and two pop outs. Brad Lidge looked almost untouchable again.  The Bad News  The Astros should have been charged with at least 6 errors.  Jeff Kent made 3 by himself, overthrowing Pettitte at 1st base and bobbling two manageable ground balls.  Adam Everett tripped and missed an easy pop fly.  Mike Lamb threw a ball away.  Lance Berkman got turned around and missed a catchable fly ball.  Andy Pettitte looked mediocre.  He gave up some cheap hits and walked a few guys, but could have easily escaped trouble, except for that one Giants hitter that always gives you trouble.  You guessed it - Frank Stallone.  I mean, Neifi Perez.  He ripped us up with 3 hits and 4 RBI's.  That's painful.  Jimy Williams again did almost everything in his power to give the game away.  First he starts Mike Lamb, an absolutely inferior player to Morgan Ensberg.  This terrifies me - Brett Tomko, the Giants starting pitcher, is the definition of an average right-handed starter...and Ensberg didn't start.    Jimy then made a number of questionable pinch-hitting moves:  Bases loaded, 2 outs, down 4-3, Andy Pettitte up.  He elects not to pinch hit.  Pettitte strikes out on 3 pithces.  2 on, 2 out, down 6-3.  He pitch hits with Jose Vizcaino.  He grounds out to 2B.  Jimy doesn't pinch hit for Brad Ausmus OR Adam Everett in the 9th inning, so Jason Lane and Morgan Ensberg both end the game on the bench.  Lance Berkman had 3 walks (awesome) but showed little power - he seems late on everything and hit a couple of weak ground balls to 1B.  Brandon Duckworth looked pretty bad - he let the first 4 batters he faced reach base, although he then K'd two straight and retired Bonds on a fly.  But his velocity was down (nothing above 90), he had trouble throwing his breaking pitches for strikes, and...he just didn't look great.  I don't think he'll have a good year.  It was a really frustrating game again.  I can handle losing - you've got to, if you're a baseball fan.  But again I feel like we could have won this game with the right lineup and the right moves (and better defense.)  The main things that bug me are the defense and Lamb starting.  We got some hits, and our pitching wasn't terrible, but we are not a good defensive team, and Morgan Ensberg >>>>> Mike Lamb.  That's all for tonight.  Better luck tomorrow: Roger Clemens vs. Jerome Williams.

						   Thanks to  urlLink Astro in Exile , I found  urlLink this article about the Astros  over at  urlLink The Hardball Times .  It's a good site they have going there - it's basically a bunch of really good baseball bloggers who decided to join forces and write really great articles together.  So I'll be stopping by there a lot, and - what the heck - I'll link 'em at the bottom of the page.  The article is excellent - essentially optimisitc, although it recognizes the team's weaknesses.  I didn't realize how poorly Pecota has Biggio projected compared to Jason Lane.    I also agree with moving Hidalgo back to CF.  For whatever reason, if you look at pictures from his monster 2000 year, he looked quicker, more agile, and had a quicker bat.  He's certainly a better CF than Biggio, and while I understand the reasoning behind putting the guy with the best arm in RF to gun down guys advancing from 1st to 3rd on singles, that pales in comparison with the extra ground Hidalgo can cover out there.  This might seem strange, since Biggio might be faster than Hidalgo, but Hidalgo reads balls better, gets better jumps, and seems way more comfortable out there.  Of course, we won't change anything.  The author also likes our pitching staff, especially Pettitte with Everett vacuuming up tons of ground balls, rips on Ausmus, and loves the Wagner trade.  I agree completely.  He ends up being very optimistic with the Astros (95 wins seems a little high to me...I'd guess 90/91) and predicting we make it to the World Series, which I love.  Anyway, read the article, it's a good one.  I'm really excited about seeing Andy Pettitte pitch tonight.  We signed him for 3 years, so we better get used to him.  I think he'll be fine, but I'll breathe easier when he has a good first outing.  If I remember correctly, we hit Tomko pretty hard last year when he was with the Cardinals, so hopefully we can get to him.  I'd like to see a big game from Berkman, who gets his first ABs as a lefty.  I also want to see a little more of how the bullpen might work and if Jimy will let Jason Lane get an at-bat.  Finally, I just want to beat the damn Giants - they always seem to be a tough matchup for us, and we need a win.  Let's get one.

						   I hate Everett in the 2-spot as well. His OBP (last year's .320) just doesn't cut it for a top-of-the-order hitter. And just because he's effective at creating productive outs, they are still outs. Which means there's one less chance of getting a runner home.   Yes, he is speedy, but Jimy doesn't seem to use that effectively. Everett stole 8 of 9 bases last year and is 12 for 13 for his career. Not bad. But until he learns to be a bit more selective (40 career walks in 520 career plate appearances), he won't be effective as the 2-hitter.   And yes, Hidalgo will repeat as the Astros' offensive player of the year, although Berkman will give him some competition. As Jack mentioned, Doggy is looking healthy and speedy (!!). But what excites me the most is that he's not hitting ahead of Ausmus this year. That's huge. He should get plenty of RBI opportunities hitting behind Bags, Kent and Berkman, and pitchers are gonna have to pitch to him now that Ensberg is in the on deck circle. I'm even going to say Hidalgo will end up in the top 5 for the MVP ballot.   --Andy

						   Andy, you're right...Oswalt shouldn't have been pulled after he gave up the single to Tucker.    HE SHOULD'VE BEEN PULLED AFTER HE GAVE UP THE SINGLE TO DURHAM.  We've got a 3 run lead and one of the best 1-2 combos at the end of the game.  You know Bonds is coming up and you need to prevent him from being able to win it.  You bring in Lidge and hope you prevent any more hits before Bonds gets up.  That way, if he goes yard, it's still a 4-3 game.    As many of you know, I despise Jimy.  I didn't much care for his quick hook at times last year.  And while I applaud him for showing some faith in his young starter, he's gotta know when's the right time to pull him.  Oswalt had been giving up a few more hits in the later innings...not making great pitches w/ 0-2 counts specifically to a few hitters.  Take him out, say thanks for a great game so far, and let your bullpen guys take care of business.  In my eye, Jimy will never please me.

						   Can't Jimy catch a break? Last year, he pulled his starters early and caught a TON of flak for being a quick hook. Now, he shows he has matured as a manager by adjusting his strategy, and we hate him again?   No, Jimy made the right choice by leaving Oswalt in.   1) Oswalt is the Astros' best pitcher. We don't have a lefty in the pen, and even if we did, Bonds obviously doesn't have a significant weakness there.   2) The two singles came on hard-fought at-bats, and were more a testament to good hitting than poor pitching. Tucker worked the count full and then connected with a high fastball to get on base.  3) Oswalt had only thrown 97 pitches or so, and his velocity was still up around 95 mph.  Besides that, I think Jimy made a statement by leaving Roy in. He already gave him Opening Day over Rocket and Pettitte, and wanted to show his faith in our young gun.   I hope Jimy doesn't go back to his old ways now. It was the smart choice to leave our best pitcher in to clean up for his own mistakes. I just wonder what Jimy said to Roy on the mound...

						   ARRRRGH.  Tough loss for the Astros; we were up 4-1 going into the 8th, Oswalt gives up a single to Ray Durham, strikes out JT Snow, and a single to Michael Tucker.  Oswalt has thrown 97 pitches, and Barry Bonds is coming up.  He's 2-for-2 with 2 doubles and a walk.  What do you do?  Jimy Williams came out, talked to Oswalt, and left him in.  He immediately gave up a 3 run HR, tying the game, and the Giants went on to win when Octavio Dotel hit a batter, who was bunted over to 2nd, threw a wild pitch (he couldn't throw any breaking pitches for strikes and didn't look good), and a sac fly drove him home.  I pull Oswalt there.  He's thrown 97 pitches, he just gave up solid line drive hits to Durham and Tucker, and Bonds has ripped him twice.  You've got Lidge and Dotel ready to go - what are you waiting for?  In Jimy's defense, I think he caught a lot of flak for pulling his starters too early last year, which I don't necessarily agree with - I thought he did a pretty good job handling the staff last year.  But there's no doubt that most people thought he was too gentle.  So I think he feels obligated to prove that he'll stick with his starters.  But I think he made the wrong choice this time.  Random observations from Opening Day:  1.  I really, really don't like Adam Everett in the 2 spot.  In the 1st inning, Craig Biggio (who looked pretty good - he's gotten rid of the high leg kick and had 2 singles and a walk) singles, and Everett immediately sac bunts him over.  I can see this happening time after time this year, and I'm going to hate it every time.  You do not waste outs.  You get 27 of them per game, and you have to score as many runs as you can in between 3-out allotments.  YOU DO NOT WASTE OUTS.  Sigh...  2.  Richard Hidalgo is going to have a big year.  He was 3-4 with a HR, but more than that, he: 1) legged out an infield single - he really moved fast down the line.  It's good to see he's still got some speed.  and 2) His HR was to opposite field.  A few years ago Hidalgo tried to pull everything.  No longer.  3.  Ausmus looks better at the plate than last year.  Of course, it wouldn't take much, and he still doesn't pull anything, but he showed good patience and a decent line drive swing.  He could go .250 / .320 / .350, which would be almost a 100 point increase in OPS.  4.  Oswalt looked pretty good.  He works fast, switches between 95 and 70, has added a changeup, and pitches inside.  I like him.  5.  With 2 outs, tie game, Jimy pinch hits with....Jose Vizcaino??  Give Jason Lane a shot!    That's it for now.  Andy's gonna argue with me, I think.

						   Opening Day, baby.  Opening Damn Day.  Roy Oswalt vs. Kirk Rueter, 6:05 pm.  Roy O has looked great all spring, and he's said all the right things about his groin feeling great.  (In case you were weirded out by that last sentence, he had a groin injury last year.)  But I still haven't seen him pitch, and he still has the high leg kick, so I'll reserve judgment 'til after tonight's game.  Rueter is a soft-tossing lefty who should get his brains bashed in tonight.  Here's our lineup and their respective OPS last year against righties, then lefties:   Biggio     759 / 775 Everett    648 / 912 Bagwell   870 / 1020 Kent       829 / 989 Berkman  950 / 847 Hidalgo    951 / 985 Ensberg   867 / 1020 Ausmus   560 / 751   ...Tremble in fear, left-handed pitchers.  Seriously.  Look at that.  The lowest OPS on the team among starting position players is Ausmus at 751.  Then Biggio at 775.  Then Berkman at 847.  Then 5 (5!!!!) guys with OPS of 912 or better against lefties (Everett was probably a little lucky, but the other 4 NO).  Too bad both the Cubs and the Cardinals have no lefties, 'cause we are built to destroy them.  Long story short, we should rip up on Rueter tonight.  I mean, obviously, it's just one game, and anything can happen....but look at that lineup again.  We're gonna bring the pain.    Oh, and Barry Bonds needs 2 HR's to catch Willie Mays, and he gets 3 games at The Juice Box to go for it.  I hope we go after him - I remember when he was chasing 70 and Dierker made us intentionally walk him tons of times and Kent would always rip us up after that...I hate that.  Go after Bonds.  I'll be watching the Astros game tonight, so someone else watch the NCAA Championship Game and tell me about it tomorrow.  Thanks.

						   All right, I'm back.  And I've gotten a bunch of complaints that I didn't write enough about my Euro-trip.  Well, fine.  Be careful what you wish for.  'Cause here comes...  THE BEST OF JACK'S TRIP  Best Big Cities  Rome.  Just wander around.  The whole city is a museum. Paris.  Crepes and accordion players. Prague.  Smaller, cheaper, good beer. Athens.  Home cooking!  And great sights / walks (better with your own tour guide.) Amsterdam.  Freeeeeedom.  Coffeeshops.  Friendly women. Berlin.  Spriechen sie Kebab?  Good beer, HUGE city.  Best Small(er) Cities  Cesky Krumlov.  Ping pong, small, intellectual, awesome. Nice.  Beaches.  Great weather. Eze-sur-Mer.  45-minute hike to a tiny town that time forgot. Zaanse Schaans.  Cheesemaker with free samples.  'Nuff said.  Best Advice  1.  Bring a lot of underwear and socks.  The other clothes don't really matter. 2.  Public parks are incredible, and the best.  They're fun to walk around in, beautiful, and they have public restrooms.  And dogs.   3.  Youth hostels are great.  If you're young and not obsessed with cleanliness, anyway.  And they are a great way to meet people.  Sometimes you meet TOO many people, though. 4.  Travel by train, preferably during the day.  It's quick, cheap, and the scenery is amazing. 5.  Used bookstores rule.  You can buy a few cheap ones, read them, and trade them in for 'new' used books at the next city.  Anyway, it was an awesome trip.  I can't tell you guys EVERYTHING - gotta keep a little bit for myself.   Astros Finalize 25-man roster   Holy crap!  The Astros did what I said they should do, optioning Brandon Backe (who had a good spring, and should be back) and Mike Gallo (who had a crappy spring) to AAA, and making Eric Bruntlett a last backup infielder.  So here's our team  C  Brad Ausmus, Raul Chavez 1B  Jeff Bagwell 2B  Jeff Kent SS  Adam Everett 3B  Morgan Ensberg IF  Jose Vizcaino, Mike Lamb, Eric Bruntlett LF  Lance Berkman CF  Craig Biggio RF  Richard Hidalgo OF  Jason Lane, Orlando Palmeiro  SP  Roy Oswalt, Andy Pettitte, Roger Clemens, Wade Miller, Tim Redding RP  Octavio Dotel, Brad Lidge, Dan Miceli, Ricky Stone, Brandon Duckworth, Jared Fernandez  I like it.  Let's rumble.    Tomorrow: San Francisco Giants matchup.

						   It's always tough to get a lot in a trade involving a guy that everyone knows is eventually going to be traded.  But, much like the Mike Lamb move, I think Gerry Hunsicker did pretty decently again this time.  The Astros traded Jeriome Robertson to the Indians for two minor-leaguers:  Luke Scott ( urlLink stats ) and Willy Taveras ( urlLink stats ).   urlLink Here's the Yahoo story .  Listen to what the Indians did with Luke Scott: teach him  urlLink patience .  Thanks, Cleveland!  By the way, that's a damn good idea.  I hope the Astros are preaching plate discipline in the minors too.  Luke Scott was pretty tough in college, but then again, so is everyone.  He had Tommy John surgery in 2001, so he might still be working his way back from that.  He's definitely got some power and a little bit of patience.  With all that said, he's not really a great prospect, but maybe he will be eventually.  We certainly need all the OF prospects we can get.  Taveras is actually a pretty good OBP guy, although he has NO power.  He's fast, too, so he is probably a fairly good defensive CF.  But, like Scott, he's not really that much of a prospect.  Still, we really had to trade Robertson, and even two pretty average OF prospects isn't bad.  Of course I wish we could have gotten Ryan Ludwick or Coco Crisp or Alex Escobar, but this is better than nothing.  And way to go, Astros, for making Tim Redding the 5th starter, instead of rooke-15-game-winner Jeriome Robertson.  The next possible move probably involves Kirk Saarloos - there have been rumors that stat-heavy teams like the Blue Jays and Red Sox are interested.  I'm kind of sick today, but at least I didn't feel bad until my last full day in Europe.  See you all soon.

						   Remember all that talk about Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens bringing a new 'attitude' to the Astros?   The new attitude seems to be one of utmost seriousness.    Don't get me wrong - we NEED to go for it all this year.  At the end of this year, we will lose (or should let go of) Clemens, Biggio, Kent, Hidalgo, probably Miller, maybe Dotel, PLEASE Vizcaino, etc...to be replace by The Kids: Jason Lane, Chris Burke, John Buck, Brooks Conrad, Willy Taveras, etc.  But the season is just over 1/4 of the way through, and already the Astros are taking everything really...seriously.  The Chronicle urged the Astros to "Get Angry" today, after Richard Justice advised them to have fun and play the game the day before.  I'm more on Justice's side on this one.  Maybe it's just me, but the whole team seems a little tight right now.  It's hard to play well when you're putting tons of pressure on yourself.  That's one thing I admire so much about the Yankees; every year, they've got huge expectations to live up to, and every year they're right there at the end.  But I don't know if that's good for every team.  Clemens and Pettitte have been awesome so far, but hopefully they're not making the game less fun for everybody.  Houston: Relax.  It really IS a marathon, not a sprint, and you simply can't have extreme intensity every single game for 162 games, or you'll go crazy.    That said, here are some minor-league stats on "The Kids" that I mentioned earlier that we might see a lot of in 2005:  C John Buck  .290 / .372 / .435, 5 HR, 14 BB in 131 AB. 1B Todd Self  .354 / .450 / .543, 15 2B, 6 HR, 32(!!!) BB in 175 AB. 2B Chris Burke  .324 / .393 / .495, 12 2B, 5 HR, 17 BB in 182 AB. 2B Brooks Conrad  .297 / .370 / .475, 13 2B, 3 HR, 21 BB in 158 AB. CF Willy Taveras  .356 / . 420 / .401, only 5 XBH, 17 BB in 177 AB.  Buck - starting 2005 C Self - backing up Bagwell Burke - starting 2005 2B Conrad - has played 3B and SS - no more Viz! Taveras - overrated.  Singles hitter with a lot of speed.  Late-inning defensive replacement and pinch-runner extraordinaire, though.

						   An awesome win for the Astros tonight: 5-0 over the Cubs.  Roy Oswalt pitched great, allowing 3 hits/1 walk in 7 innings, striking out 8, and Lance Berkman continues to crush, hitting a 2-run HR.  This is how games are supposed to go: rely on your best players (Oswalt, Berkman) to get the win.    I'm heading up to Chicago this weekend to visit the younger bro, enjoy Dillo Day, and catch a Cubs-Astros game at Wrigley on Monday afternoon.  Can't wait.

						   What's happened lately?  Well, the Astros have gone 1-3.  Lance Berkman has been going crazy, our starting pitching has been a little iffy, Morgan Ensberg is hitting almost nothing besides line drives...  ...and I'm getting tired of tennis.  I didn't think it would ever happen, but teaching it 4/5/6 hours a day and playing for another 1 or 2 is wearing on me.    The NL Central is now in a 3-way tie, with the Astros, Cubs, and Reds all at 24-18, and the Cardinals only 1.5 games back.  Once again we're trying to the best 'Pythagorean' team in baseball (the greatest differential between runs scored and runs allowed) and somehow not make the playoffs:  We've outscored our opponents by 61 runs (233-172).  Cubs?  206-160.  (+46)  Reds?  197-206.  (-9!!!)  Cardinals?  211-193  (+28)  Why is this?  Why do we win blowouts and lose close games?  1.  We have a team that (no matter what Jimy Williams wants it to be) is built for the big inning: a couple of walks and a 3-run bomb.    2.  Inefficient bullpen usage.  When is the better team to use your best reliever:  A) Up by 4 in the 9th inning (a 'Jimy save') B) Up by 1 in the 8th inning  3.  Pinch-hitters.  Pinch-hitters come up in a lot of big situations in close games (and should come up even more often for us, since we're carrying Everett and Ausmus), and our "Ace" pinch-hitters, in order of at-bats:  1. Jose Vizcaino, 41 (.171 / .261 / .195 = 456 OPS) 2. Orlando Palmeiro, 34 (.176 / .263 / .294 = 557 OPS)  What can we do?  Jimy can learn a few new tricks, Hunsicker could trade for a bat off the bench...or we could get ready for a few more close losses.

						   Astros 9, Marlins 2.  Lance Berkman and (gulp) Brad Ausmus lead the hitting attack, Wade Miller pitches well enough to win, and we actually work some counts against Dontrelle Willis.  He threw a 91-pitch complete game against us 5 days ago; he had thrown 96 pitches through 4 innings this time.  The big news last night was, of course, Randy Johnson's perfect game.  I got home at 8 or so, flipped by the Astros game, saw we were up 6-2 or so, and then heard the announcers mentioning that Randy was perfect through 7 innings.  So I hurry over to TBS and watch the last 2 innings.  Randy was still throwing 98mph fastballs and 88mph unhittable sliders those last 2 innings, and it seemed almost inevitable that he would get the perfect game, which he did, striking out Nick Green and Eddie Perez in the 9th to end it.  Randy pumped his fist and pointed to the sky, but his young catcher Robby Hammock did him one better, jumping for joy several times before rushing out to envelop Randy in a bear hug.  The funniest thing is that Randy is at least a foot taller than Hammock, so it looked like a little kid running up to hug his Dad.  Good stuff.  Congrats, Randy.  Jason Schmidt didn't pitch too badly last night, either - he allowed only an infield single to Michael Barrett (on an incredibly close play at 1st, and only after juuuuuuuuuust missing on a 2-2 pitch) and struck out 14 Cubs in a 1-0 shutout.  Oh, and the Yankees lost, 1-0.  All in all, a good day to be a baseball fan.  I've got a tennis tournament coming up this weekend, and my first match will be against either: 1) my good buddy Jason - check out his  urlLink blog , too or 2) a guy I've played about 20 times and beaten once, Robert Bickmore.  Urgh.  Oh, and I'm playing doubles with JT, and we're playing the Tate bros.  The older one, Matt, played high school tennis with the two of us before playing college tennis for four years.  The younger one, Mark, just won the 4A singles state championship.  Our goal: to peg Mark.  Nah, we'll play hard, and it should be a fun match.  It's a beautiful day outside, so it's time to play some tennis.  See ya.

						   I missed the entire Mets series, but apparently much of it was painful to watch anyway.    Yesterday's loss was especially frustrating, I imagine: 17 baserunners = 2 runs??  No intentional walk to Piazza in the 9th?  A waste of a dominant start by Clemens?    Bah.  But to everyone who wants Dotel demoted and Lidge made closer: Calm down.  Octavio Dotel is a better pitcher than Brad Lidge.  He's off to a slow start, has given up 4 HR's in 20 innings when he gave up 9 all of last year, and his control is a bit spotty....  But he has been the best non-Gagne reliever in baseball over the past 3 years.  He is dominant, regularly unhittable, and he got beat by the best-hitting catcher in history (easily) last night.  It happens.  Get over it.  We'll probably lose Dotel next year, and then Lidge will get his chance.  That's it.  End of story.  We have to get more runs with 17 baserunners.  That's the key.  Tonight: Wade Miller at Dontrelle Willis.  This is a big game, for several reasons:  1.  Is Wade Miller healthy?  There were rumors that he had been hiding an injury last year, and he's looked a little different from start to start this year.  2.  Can we figure out Dontrelle Willis?  Last year he dominated the league until teams saw him for the 2nd time.  From then on he got hammered.  Let's see if we can do the same.

						   This was a playoff atmosphere game, and we seem to lose more of those than we win.  Thoughts:  Tim Redding - I'll give you credit for fighting through a lot of baserunners, but you don't look comfortable at all, and eventually those baserunners will turn into runs.  I'm one of your supporters but I don't have much confidence in you these days.  Dotel - You wanted the pressure before the year, so you got it.  But if you go walk/triple/walk on the first 3 batters you face (Choi/Pierre/Castillo...ugh), you're in trouble.  Ausmus - Are you really going to turn a DP on Miguel Cabrera?  Tag the runner at home, no matter what.  Jimy/Viz - you're all used to this one.  After Hidalgo's encouraging bases loaded walk to put us in the lead 2-1 in the bottom of the 8th, and new LHP Matt Perisho coming in to face Lamb, Jimy sends up (Jason Lane, please??) Vizcaino to pinch-hit with the bases loaded and 1 out.  First pitch GIDP to 2nd, on a ball that he might have been able to beat out, but instead he'll just lightly jog to 1st base.  By the way, the pitcher, Matt Perisho got the win from that one pitch.  Craig Biggio - 0-for-5 with a killer GIDP, and you could have caught that ball in the 9th.  Good effort...but make the play.  We face the Mets in a 3 game series, throwing Oswalt / Pettitte / Clemens against Trachsel / Baldwin / Leiter.  Sweep?  Oh, and I'm still working on the new blog template, so bear with me.  But this weekend, at least, I'm off to Memphis and then Nashville to see some old friends.  Take it easy.

						   The Astros followed up one of their best games of the year (a comeback 6-1 win to make Roger Clemens 7-0) with a fairly lackluster peformance last night, losing 5-2 to Dontrelle Willis and Mike Lowell.  Lowell crushed two solo HR's off Wade Miller, and Willis got a lot of groundball outs, as the Astros were predictably befuddled by his huge leg kick and unusual delivery.  Willis was nails against the league his first time through last year, too, but they seemed to eventually figure him out.  I assume we'll do the same if we see him again.  Wade Miller pitched fine to everyone but Lowell, but he left with 2 on and 2 out in the 5th (or 6th) with 'neck tightness'.

						   The Astros followed up one of there best games of the year (a comeback 6-1 win to make Roger Clemens 7-0) with a fairly lackluster peformance last night, losing 5-2 to Dontrelle Willis and Mike Lowell.  Lowell crushed two solo HR's off Wade Miller, and Willis got a lot of groundball outs, as the Astros were predictably befuddled by his huge leg kick and unusual delivery.  Willis was nails against the league his first time through last year, too, but they seemed to eventually figure him out.  I assume we'll do the same if we see him again.  Wade Miller pitched fine to everyone but Lowell, but he left with 2 on and 2 out in the 5th (or 6th) with 'neck tightness'.

						   A win is a win is a win, and the Astros just beat the Braves 2-1 in a duel between Andy Pettitte and Russ Ortiz.    The Braves scored in the 4th when J.D. Drew and Johnny Estrada hit back-to-back 2 out doubles, but we got the run back in the 5th after Jeff Kent got a bad-bounce double, took 3rd on a groundout to SS (aggressive baserunning from probably the slowest runner on the team), and scored on a Brad Ausmus sac fly.  Then with 2 outs in the 7th we scored after an Ensberg single, Ausmus walk, Vizcaino walk, and Palmeiro walk.  Look at that again: 3 of the 5 worst hitters on the team (Everett, Chavez also) drawing walks!!!  I love it.  That was it - we won 2-1, as Miceli was solid in the 7th and 8th and Dotel dominated in the 9th.  We get a day off tomorrow, which will hopefully be enough to get Richard Hidalgo out of his funk.  I wouldn't have thought he would ever slump after his hot start, but his swing his long, he's standing too far away from the plate, and he looks absolutely overmatched out there.  Pick it up, Doggy.

						   The Astros have gone 2-1 since I posted last; Wade Miller dominated as we got the sweep of the Pirates, Tim Redding had his first good outing of the year against the Braves, and we lost a crazy, crazy game to the Braves, 5-4.  Our starting pitching was tough in all three games, but it's the last one I want to talk about.  Roy Oswalt is cruising along through 7 innings, we're up 3-1, and everything looks great.  In the bottom of the 8th, Mark DeRosa singles, and Oswalt gets ahead of little Jesse Garcia 0-2.  He throws one high and inside, Garcia ducks, and immediately starts trotting to 1st base.  The home plate umpire starts walking towards first and throwing up his hands and looking confused.  All of a sudden the 2nd base umpire comes over, they confer, and award Garcia 1st base.  Replays were inconclusive as to whether it hit his helmet or not; I think it probably did.    BUT HOW THE HELL CAN THE 2ND BASE UMPIRE TELL??????  He's 120 feet away.  The home plate umpire is 2 feet away.  There is no friggin' way that the 2nd base umpire can make that call.  No way.  Ever.  Then a sac bunt, a 4-pitch walk to Betemit, a single to Adam LaRoche, and a bases-loaded walk to Chipper Jones.  I think Roy probably should have been pulled after the HBP by Garcia.  He was clearly pissed off, and couldn't find the strike zone.  Gallo and Backe bailed us out of that inning, and then we got off to a hot start in the 9th: Ensberg triple, Viz RBI single, Berkman single.  1st and 3rd, 0 out.  An insurance run would be great, right?  Biggio K.  Everett K.  Bagwell weak groundout.  The Braves tie it in the 9th off of Lidge with a bloop single to LF and a triple that hit off the chalk on the RF line.  Garcia should have been out at 3rd, too, but Everett chose to not cut off Hidalgo's throw even though it was off-line.  Then our bullpen got tough again, and didn't allow any runs.  Then a frustrating inning in the 10th against ANTONIO ALFONSECA.  Kent grounds out to 2nd because he is standing incredibly far away from home plate - he can't even reach the outside corner.  Bagwell did the same thing against Smoltz.  Are these guys suddenly afraid of getting hit?  Why are they standing so far off the plate.  Hidalgo's the same way - put a pitch anywhere near the outside half of the plate, and he can't drive it.  He's standing too far off.  These guys need to fix that, quick.  Then Ricky Stone comes on, strikes out Chipper and J.D. Drew, and gives up a HR to Andruw Jones on a good pitch, a sinker low and away to Jones went opposite field on.  Tough, tough loss.  Can't really blame it on anyone but Oswalt - if he can't get DeRosa, Jesse Garcia, Wilson Betemit, and Adam LaRoche out with the game on the line, he doesn't deserve the win.  He probably shouldn't have still been in there, though.  And we've gotta get another run home in the 9th with 1st and 3rd, 0 out.  Biggio and Everett just need to put the ball in play there.  Anyway, today is Pettitte vs. Russ Ortiz, who has been tough on us in the past.    Happy Mothers Day!

						   I went to another Astros game tonight, and watched in awe as Roger Clemens moved past Steve Carlton into 2nd place all-time in strikeouts.  Oh, and the Astros won 6-2, as Jeff Kent, Morgan Ensberg, and 7 walks lead to some offense and Clemens + 9 straight outs from the bullpen kept the Pirates quiet.  The only minor damper was Chad Harville came in to pitch the 7th but left after facing a batter due to a strained right quad.  He's day to day.  Even if he's hurt, we could call up Ricky Stone again...no big deal.  The 'Stros go for the sweep tomorrow: Wade Miller vs. Kris Benson.  I'll go the anti-stats route on today's impressions, since I was actually right there:  Adam Everett is TERRIFIC defensively.  It's almost a shame we don't have many groundball pitchers on our staff (only Pettitte), because he's a vacuum cleaner out there.  On the flip side, Jeff Kent is not good defensively, and looks slow and kinda bored.  Lance Berkman, for all his muscle and baby fat, has some of the quickest hands in baseball.  You cannot throw an inside fastball by him.  It cannot be done.   That's all.  Oh, and I love going to baseball games.  I've been to two and both times I've never made it to my official seat.  You just wander around and pick Players of the Game and eat hot dogs and drink beer and I LOVE IT SO MUCH.

						   Reds 7, Astros 5.  This was a troubling loss.  Roy Oswalt wasn't sharp early; he said he felt like he was throwing a 'cue ball' most of the game, and we were down 2-0 early.  Oswalt singled in a run in the 2nd to make it 2-1, and then the Astros had runners on 2nd and 3rd with 0 outs and Kent, Berkman, and Hidalgo due up.  Foul out.  Foul out.  Fly out.  0 runs.  Then Mike Lamb booted an inning-ending double play ball, Jacob Cruz followed with a double, and we were down 4-1.  We get a run back after an error: 4-2.  Then Raul Chavez doubles in two guys to tie it 4-4, and we pinch hit with...Orlando Palmeiro.  Strikeout looking.  Biggio doubles to right to take the lead 5-4, and everything looks great.  Harville gets two outs, then walks a guy to bring up the only dangerous hitter on their team, Adam Dunn.  Jimy (correctly) brings in Lidge, who strikes him out.  In the next inning Lidge strikes out the first two batters he faces, bringing up Jacob Cruz.  Walk.  This brings up Javier Valentin, 3rd catcher for the Reds.  He CRUSHES a 1-1 fastball down the middle of the plate.  Home run.  6-5, Reds.  Dotel gives up a solo shot to make it 7-5, and although Everett gets on bases leading off the 9th, Bagwell, Kent and Berkman all hit long fly ball outs to end the game.   Main annoyance: In a close game, neither Lane or Ensberg get any at-bats.  Instead, Vizcaino and Palmeiro both go 0-for-1.  Also, you've gotta get some runs with 2nd and 3rd and 0 out.  Finally, Mike Lamb is not good in the field.  He's a great pinch hitter, but should NOT start over Morgan Ensberg.  Oh well...we'll get them next time.  Up next: 3 game series against Pittsburgh, starting today, with:  Andy Pettitte vs. Josh Fogg.  I want to see the offense, especially Kent, Hidalgo, and Ensberg, get going.  We're going at home against crummy Fogg.

						   The 'Stros have come back twice against the Reds in the last 2 games, winning both.  I really don't know how we managed to win yesterday - I was playing in a tennis tournament, and I had to go play when we were down 4-0....then I come back and we're down 5-3...then I come back again and we WON!  On a suicide squeeze by Brad Ausmus???  WOW.  Hey, I'll take them how I can get them.  I'm actually going to the game tonight with my friend that I haven't seen in a while, so we're gonna watch as Roy Oswalt tears through the Reds lineup like Jason Barfield at a buffalo wing-eating contest.  I CAN'T WAIT.  Man, I love baseball.  Oh, and starting NOW, I'm going to start taking notes during every Astros game and posting them here, 'cause I gotta pick it up.  Bi-weekly updates just aren't cutting it.  Talk to you guys soon!

						   The Astros have gone 2-1 since my last post, losing to the Pirates 4-2 (in an Oswalt - Fogg matchup!!??), winning 2-0 behind a combined 2-hitter from Pettitte and bullpen, and winning 6-1 behind Clemens and Lance Berkman.  The bullpen has really stepped it, especially The Alien Inhabiting Dan Miceli's Body.  He's been insanely good, and better than he has his entire career, so he might regress a bit eventually, but Lidge and Dotel are awesome, and should remain so, as long as they're not overused.  Morgan Ensberg had a great night last night, going 2-for-4 with a single and a double (both of which he CRUSHED), and a deep fly ball to the warning track in RF.  He's just about all the way back, and should become the starting 3B again.  Mike Lamb has done a surprisingly good job filling in, but he's more valuabe off the bench as a LH bat and spot starter.  Tonight: Wade Miller vs. Aaron Harang.

						   Hey!  It's been a while, but I got a house, and furniture, and the Astros got Carlos Beltran!    So it's been a good week.  Andy and I got in to the warehouse on Tuesday night I think and there was (of course) a party going on, so we just wandered up and jumped in.  No one knew exactly when we were working but they were more than happy to give us food and beer, so it was ok.  We slept in the back of the big trailer that night, and hightailed it to Flagstaff before they could make us do clean-up work around the warehouse.  We got in, called up some friends, and got to house-hunting.  We went to a few apartments which were ok but kinda small, and then just happened to be driving by Hospital Hill (a quiet neighborhood about 10 mins. north of NAU and 5 mins. north of Historic Downtown Flagstaff) when we spotted a For Rent sign and a guy (Will Loomis) in the yard.  He was a really friendly guy, showed us all around the house (which is awesome...I don't want to describe it too much because you're all gonna come visit), and we really liked it.  So we dropped off the application that night, signed it in the morning, and moved in that night!  Then we realized we needed a few things.  Bed.  Futon.  Table.  Food.  Beer.  So we've pretty much been filling in the blanks the past few days.  It's been exhausting, lots of driving and shopping and garage sales....but yesterday was the big day, as we bought a great coffee table for 20, a futon (with frame) for 25, and a 3 piece living room set and recliner for 505.    Now we're basically completely moved in, and we found out our schedule for July:  Andy has trips on the 1st and 13th. Jack has trips on the 8th and 25th.  There are a few more swampers this year, so trips are a little harder to come by.  This also means that I'll probably only be doing those two trips all summer, since the folks drive up on the 5th and then JT/Jason fly in sometime in early August, and then Orientation starts on the 23rd.  Hopefully I can give Andy all the trips that I would have gotten in August.  So that's my life.  As for the Astros:  YEAH, BELTRAN.  We're in win-now mode, like it or not.  Dotel's great, and I'm sorry to see him go, and Buck might be the catcher of the future, but Beltran is one of the top 20 or so players in the game and brings great defense, speed, and youth to a team that does not have any of those.  Of course we've lost 2 straight games to the Rangers since acquiring Beltran, but Pettitte's coming back and Jimy moved Everett down in the lineup today (with Bagwell hitting 2nd!)  I like our chances, long term, although the bullpen scares me.  Lidge should be solid, but he tired last year and has thrown a lot of innings this year, and Dan Miceli and David Weathers are ok but not that great.  Gallo, Bullinger, Munro....yikes.    But we got Beltran, and for now, that's all that matters.  Keep in touch, everyone, although my cell phone gets crappy service out here.  I'll probably switch to Spring or Verizon pretty soon.

						   This is a copy of the latest post from  urlLink my blog , where I discuss all kinds of topics including the Astros.    OH BEHBEH!  The Astros got Beltran!!!!  Our part of the deal was Dotel and minor-league catcher, John Buck to KC for Beltran.  The Royals then sent Dotel to the A's for some prospects.    I love this trade.  It's clear that the team we had wasn't going to get it done this year.  The offense has been bad as of late, with a ridiculous inability to get timely hits and score runs.  Beltran should provide an obvious spark to the lineup.  No telling where Jimy will put him in the lineup, but I would guess that he'll move into either the 2 slot (shifting Everett/Ensberg to the bottom of the lineup) or he'll hit 3rd and push Berkman/Kent/Bagwell each down a spot.  I hope Beltran bats 2nd for the simple fact that Jimy cannot possibly have him sac bunt every time that Biggio gets on base.  (Well, I won't put anything past Jimy at this point.)  The other obvious advantage Beltran brings is that we no longer have to bear the horrid defense of Biggio in CF.  I cringe every time a ball is hit near Tal's Hill, for fear that Biggio's going to eat face again.  I'm not sure how I want the defense to be rearranged now that Biggio has been supplanted from CF.  In no way can he move to RF...baserunners will move 1st to 3rd on every single to RF with his weak arm.  So our options are to move him to LF, back to 2B, or bench him.  From what I've read, it appears that moving him to LF is the most likely option.  This would force Berkman to RF and send Lane back to the bench.  If he were to move back to 2B, Kent would shift to 3rd and Ensberg/Lamb would see the bench.  The best option defensively would be simply bench Biggio and keep everyone else the same, but that's not going to happen.  As for what we gave up...well I'm happy we didn't part with both Buck and Chris Burke.  The loss of Dotel obviously weakens our bullpen, but I think Lidge can more than adequately move into the closer position.  This more clearly defines why we acquired Weathers....he's take over the 7th inning duties from Miceli, who shifts to Lidge's primary setup man.  I think we're going to have to acquire another bullpen arm....a quality setup guy (unless they choose to acquire a closer and shift Lidge back to setup man).  A good lefty would also help.    We also gave up John Buck, a 23 year old catcher, who's tearing up AAA this year.  However he has been inconsistent throughout the minors, having weak years in both 2002 and 2003.  He's not especially strong defensively, as he has trouble throwing runners out on the basepaths, but he's got good offensive potential.  The problem is...well we still have Ausmus for at least another year, so Buck wouldn't be the starter until at least 2006....and you know what, no telling how strong he'll be in the majors.    That's all I got for tonight.  I'm getting tired and having trouble putting together good thoughts.  From what I heard tonight, Beltran is expected in Arlington for Friday night's game, so we should see the future outlook of our lineup then.

						   Panic button: ENGAGE.  Astros get:  David Weathers Jeremy Griffiths  Mets get:  Richard Hidalgo 4 million  Ignoring the fact that we get to plug in Jason Lane, which of the above would you rather have?  Hidalgo's incredibly streaky, but he's a superb defensive player and put up a 950 OPS last year.  He may not be worth 12 million, but he's not bad, and we dumped him at his lowest value possible, instead of this offseason or after his HUGE April.  David Weathers is a slightly above average reliever and Griffiths is a non-prospect.    Mets win this one.   What I really don't like about this trade is how truly bad it makes our outfield defense.  Biggio has been god-awful in center, with numerous acrobatic collapses on Tal's Hill, Lane has a below-average arm, and Lance can't run (although he always seems to make the play).    In other news, Oswalt is probably injured, Pettitte isn't completely ready, Clemens is starting to show his age, and we traded for Pete Munro.  And Jose Vizcaino is our starting SS as Everett has a minor injury.  Oh, and we basically released Ricky Stone, while retaining Kirk Bullinger, Eric Bruntlett....damn.  Sometimes I love this team so much that I hate them.  Two more days and I'm off.

						   Ready for this one?   "Astros SS Adam Everett recorded his 19th sacrifice bunt in the first inning, the most in a single season in the majors since Neifi Perez had 22 for Colorado in 1997."  It's not even the All-Star Break and Adam Everett already has more sacrifice bunts than ANYONE in the majors in 6 years.  Man, I miss Morgan Ensberg hitting 2nd.

						   Time for my 2004 NL All-Star ballot:  1B - Albert Pujols.  Sorry, Sean Casey, but YOU'RE NOT THAT GOOD.  Pujols is drawing more walks this year and he's insanely, painfully good (I once dropped him in a fantasy league!)  2B - Jeff Kent.  You were thinking Tony Womack?  Kent's got a 24-game hitting streak as of Friday, and a cool 905 OPS.  Not bad for a 36-year old second baseman.  SS -  Jack Wilson.  THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  You think I wanted to vote for Jack Freakin' Wilson????  But my god...Renteria and Orlando Cabrera are sucking, Adam Everett is terrible offensively....I have to do it.  3B - Scott Rolen.  He's got 63 RBI's.  I don't care if you do have Pujols and Edmonds in front of you, that's a lot.  Sorry, Mike Lowell - you're good too.  C - Mike Piazza.  He got off to a slow start, but the best catcher of all time now has 13 HR's, 30 RBI, is hitting .305, and...is the best catcher of all time.  Tough luck, Johnny Estrada.  OF - Bobby Abreu, Lance Berkman, Barry Bonds.  I hate to keep Adam Dunn off the team, but Abreu has been damn good, Berkman's got an 1100 OPS and has carried the Astros (along with Kent) for a month and Barry Bonds is still alive.  SP - Roger Clemens.  He just barely beats out Randy Johnson and Ben Sheets.  Clemens is 9-0, tons of K's...and he's 41.  And he was supposed to RETIRE!!   Closer - Armando Benitez.  Sorry, Gagne, but you BLEW IT in last year's All Star Game, so take a seat, and let Mr. 40-straight-batters-retired-in-a-row take over (and a 0.54 ERA, too).  Oh, and Brad Lidge can set-up...he's got 55 K's!!!  Well, that's my team.   urlLink Bring it, JT .

						   Well, the Astros scored 4 runs in a 3-game series - AND WON 2 OF THEM!!  That's pretty good, but not as good as back-to-back shutouts off starts by Clemens and Miller.  Our pitching is looking solid, especially our 'best 6' or so that teams would see if we make it to the playoffs: Oswalt, Pettitte (or Miller), Clemens, Miceli, Lidge, Dotel.  That's tough.  Jason Lane finally got a start last night and did nothing with it, unfortunately.  He just needs to play more, but I wish he'd get some hits so Jimy would have to notice.    We had a great small party last night, with beer pong and Michelle's crazy dance music leading the way.  Then it got a little too wild as Michelle wandered off and we looked for her and...well...things just got a little weird from then on.  But it's all good, and I can't wait to do it again, especially since Mark is quite good at beer pong - at least, someone to challenge me!  Mark - ARE YOU ASKING FOR A CHALLENGE?????

						   Jack's 2004 AL All Star Team  C - Jorge Posada, Yankees.  Victor Martinez (and Pudge Rodriguez, actually)are close, but Posada doubles Martinez in walks (36 to 18) despite playing in 3 fewer games and has a 78-point OPS advantage over the 2003 World Series Hero.  1B - Ken Harvey, Royals.  What happened to all the AL first basemen?  I thought about taking Jason Giambi, but he just came off the DL and might be hurt.  No one else has really stood out, and I thought about going with Rafael Palmeiro since he's almost done and is having a solid year, but Harvey has been quite good (.375 / .412 / .543) So I'm going with the Big Fella.  Although he did just put his own pitcher on the DL yesterday by running into him.  2B - Juan Uribe, White Sox.  Ugh!!!  But I have to; he's the best right now.  Believe me, I want to pick Alfonso Soriano, but 1) he's not as good as everyone thinks he is and 2) he's not as good as even someone like ME thinks he is.  Soriano is at .284 / .326 / .431 with 19 extra-base hits; Uribe is at .309 / .368 / .508 with 21 XBH!!  Send him in.  SS - Carlos Guillen, Tigers.  I wonder if Seattle regrets trading Guillen (who's got a 961 OPS and 28 XBH) so they could sign Rich Aurilia (633 OPS, 12 XBH).  Oops.  Sorry Tejada - you gotta swing HARRRRRDAAAAA.  3B - Alex Rodriguez.  I'm not looking Melvin Mora in the eye when I make this pick, but ARod is unstoppable, and is finally dominating after a slow start.  If an All-Star Game in the next 10 years does not include ARod, I will be ill.  OF - Manny Ramirez, Carlos Beltran, Vladimir Guerrero.  Ok, no more crazy picks like Harvey, Uribe, and Guillen.  I mean....come on.  Look at that outfield, and tremble in fear.    DH - Frank Thomas.  He'll always be underappreciated.  Arguably the best non-Bonds hitter of the last 20 years.  51 walks so far this year, and a 1053 OPS.   SPs - Curt Schilling, Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder, C.C. Sabathia, Freddy Garcia.  Schilling deserves to start, Hudson and Mulder are the only ones with sub-3.00 ERAs, and Sabathia and Garcia are close.  RPs - Mariano Rivera, Keith Foulke, Franciso Cordero, Francisco Rodriguez.  Saves leader, Foulke Foulke!, Cordero's been tough, and K-Rod is going NUTS.  So that's my team.  Check out JT's at his  urlLink blog .  Coming soon: NL!

						   I finally gave my boss my two weeks' notice on Friday, so I'm officially heading off to The Big Ditch with Andy on June 21.  We'll be rafting the Colorado River for a couple of months, and then I start school Aug. 16, but I think he's planning on rafting a few more trips (he doesn't start his senior year at NU until late September).  So it's kind of the end of an era here in The Woodlands, and I'd like to say I want to do all the things I never did...but I've done a lot, and I'm still doing my favorite things, like tennis, Mario Tennis, bridge, frisbee golf, and watching Jason eat cheese fries.  So here's to a good last few weeks.  I admit that I've been following the Astros a little less (though I still watch every game I can and keep updated on everything possible) and baseball in general a little more.  Guess I'm just a fan of the game as a whole.  Actually JT and I have had a little argument going about who should be voted to the All Star Game - 'proven' superstars that everyone wants to see regardless of their statistics (a.k.a. Nomar Garciaparra is leading the AL for shortstops, despite not playing a game yet), or guys that kind of came out of nowhere to dominate so far this year (Sean Casey, Victor Martinez, Joe Kennedy).  Well, in my next post, I'm going to unveil my 2004 AL All Star Ballot, and I challenge JT to do the same, and we'll compare.  Oh, and stop by his  urlLink blog , too.  It's good stuff.

						   I had a GREAT weekend up in Chicago, where I learned a few things:  1. I will never be as good as my little brother at Caps. 2. The Northwestern Campus is a lot nicer during the spring and summer than the winter  and most importantly  3. Girls still have an (apparently infinite) capacity to surprise me.  So I got in around 4pm Saturday (which happened to be Dillo Day, a joyous day when all the Northwestern students join hands and sing campfire songs while drinking poisonous amounts of alcohol.  I arrive to fanfare as most of Andy's frisbee buddies and Dano the Man-O are all there and we immediately start playing Caps, grilling some burgers and dogs, and talking about life.  Then we decide to go listen to the Wailers, Bob Marley's old band!  They started off slow but then peaked with "I Shot the Sherrif" and "No Woman No Cry" with fireworks going off in the background.  The next day we went and visited Toni, my Mom's Mom, who's doing great, and was pleased to hear that Andy's new gal Katie is an Alpha Phi just like she used to be!  Small world.  Then we went and saw Shrek 2 with Uncle Marty and his lady, which was pretty good - a little cheesy, but Antonio Banderas steals the show.  So then FINALLY my good buddy Jess gets in about 10:30 pm to Union Station...she took a train from East Lansing and it got stopped because of tornadoes!  But eventually she made it, fresh from camping that morning, and we went and chilled at Andy's friend's place for a while and caught up on stuff.  Then: The Day With Everything.  Running, home run derby, frisbee, Al's Deli, iced butter cookies, Cubs game, sports bar, dancing on tables (Katie and Jess....not me....sigh), Caps, hockey game (Flames lose....NOO), and deep dish pizza.  It was an amazing day.  Then I don't really remember this morning very well but I'm typing this from Houston, so I must have made it back all right.  And now I gotta go to work, so I'll leave you with that.  Andy, Katie, Dano, and especially Jess, great to see you guys.

						   Surprise, surprise...the Astros lost again tonight.&nbsp; I didn't even bother to look up how far back we are...I know it's a damn lot.&nbsp; We start a quick two game series at Arizona, followed by a 3 game series at home versus the Brewers.&nbsp; I'm going to go out on a limb and say that if we don't win 4 of these 5 games, then our season is done.&nbsp; At which point you can probably expect Beltran to be shipped off somewhere, as well as me spending no more money to see our crappy team (besides maybe one more trip to see the Rocket).

						   UGH.   Adam Everett just hit his fourth homer of the season, a two-run shot with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. That would have won the game for us: we were down by one run after seven innings. Unfortunately, we lost the game 7-4, thanks to Paul Lo Duca's grand slam off Dave Weathers in the bottom of the eighth. This time the Stros smacked a grand total of seven hits against the outstanding Mr. Jose LIma. Not like we know his stuff or anything. Beltran had the only other significant hit, a two-run homer in the sixth. He also made two outfield assists. Does anyone else on the team even want to win?   .500 at the All-Star Break. Wow.   How long til the Texans take the field?

						   Three hits. One run. Against Wilson Alvarez. Another decent Clemens start wasted. Another close game lost.   Nevertheless, I feel a run coming on. Along with most every Astro fan on the planet, I am begging for the firing of Jimy as soon as the retractable roof closes on the 2004 All Star Game. But then comes the good part: the run.   Here's how it's gonna happen: we hire a decent manager. Anyone. Bob Brenly. Bobby Valentine. Jerry Manuel. I don't care. Anyone. The important thing is, we gotta shift things up around the dugout. Send everyone in the organization a wake-up call, that we gotta start lollygagging and get our act together.   Shake up the lineup while we're at it. Bat Beltran second, for God's sake. Then Berkman, Kent, Bagwell, Ensberg, Everett, Ausmus. I hope our new manager hates sac bunts as much as Jimy loves them. I hope he never uses Vizcaino or Palmeiro ever again and gives every possible pinch hit opportunity to Lane.   Our schedule right out of the gate from the break is relatively easy. Eighteen of our first 23 games after the break are at home, including series against the terrible Expos, the surprising Brewers, the injury-plagued Diamondbacks and the reeling Braves. Our five away games are at Cincinnatti, where we always seem to hit well (especially Lance) and at lowly Arizona. Immediately after that, we have away series at New York and Montreal, two very beatable teams. That's a stretch of 29 games in which we could easily go 23-6 or thereabouts.   Of course, the way we're playing right now, we could easily go 6-23. But we gotta stay positive.   By the way, Ensberg played shortstop for a couple of innings today, with Lamb at third.

						   It's amazing how a disappointing month of the season can change my expections for the Astros this year.   Now all I really hope for are two things:  1.  That Jimy Williams, our crappy manager, and Harry Spilman, our apparently even crappier hitting coach, get fired soon.  I imagine they're gonna wait until after the All-star game, but I sure hope it's really soon after that.  2.  That Bagwell retires after this year.  He's owed a minimum of $39 million over the next 2 years---$15 million in 2005, $17 million in 2006, and either $18 million in 2007 or a $7 million buyout.  Bagwell's been great for this team and for this city, but his shoulder is obviously destroying his game.  He can barely throw now and he now looks terrible at the plate.  I don't know why a pitcher would throw anything but low and away to him because he looks utterly incapable of hitting those pitches.  This team needs a shake-up and they need it soon.  We're completely incapable of winning close games.  Case in point...Clemens had another stellar outing tonight....his third straight start of 7 innings with only 1 run given up.  His record in those 3 games now, 1-0 with two no decisions.  It's sad that we can rarely count on this offense to put up more than one or two runs.  Just sad!

						   Well I just spent 3 hours sorting through stats and players to comprise my full All-star rosters.  I have the projected starters, along with 12 pitchers and 12 reserves for both squads.  It was quite the lengthy process.   urlLink Come check it out !

						   I didn't even see the Yankees - Red Sox game last night, but from everything I've read this morning it sounds like one of the most dramatic baseball games ever played.  Check it out.  Carlos Beltran continues to try to carry the Astros but comes up a little short, as Houston loses 5-4 off a Sosa walk-off HR.  Any reason why Lidge was pitching after throwing about 40 pitches the game before?  There was a funny quote on TV the other day during the Astros - Cubs day game 2 days ago:  "All of the Astros told me they couldn't believe how good Carlos Beltran is."  This just brings up a ton of funny images for me:  Craig Biggio's mouth dropping open when he sees how much ground Beltran can cover.  Jeff Bagwell rubbing his eyes when he sees Beltran throw from CF.  Pretty much the entire team dumbstruck as Beltran crushes 4 HR's in a 3-game series with the Cubs, only to have the rest of the offense (except Biggio) do very little.  Seriously, it seems like we have to do so much to get a win these days, like Roy Oswalt pitching a shutout, or Craig Biggio hitting 2 HR's.  Events like that aren't going to happen every day.  We need some 'normal' wins.    Morgan Ensberg, where hast thou power gone?  You're slugging .355, or thereabouts.  The announcers also mentioned that the Astros are 'happy' with the way Ensberg is hitting this year.  WHAT??!!??  The strange this is, I can picture Jimy relentlessly encouraging Ensberg to go the other way, to steal bases, to drop down a bunt, because THAT'S WHAT REAL BALLPLAYERS DO.  I, of course, just want to him to crush home runs and draw walks, which is what GOOD offensive players do.  I'm in Flagstaff all week, doing...stuff.  Probably trying to meet the NAU tennis coach, getting my AZ drivers license...maybe buying some new clothes, too.  Give me a call (on Andy's cell phone).  Oh:  Jack Wade 1607 N. Sunset Dr. Flagstaff, AZ  86001
