      Growing up  Songs you have grown out of Cant quite bring back those secret paths  To secret lands trodden. Ideals adopted through these whiles That crashed and tumbled downhill Hindrance alone in matters that  Lost sight of peaceful quiet Roads no longer defined, demarked Just walked on, as they present  Ideals crashed  With might unknown  Saves the hidden prize Barring doors to a past unfelt Just observed as the passerby.

      "Pooh, promise you won't forget me, ever. Not even when I'm hundred." Pooh thought for a little. "How old shall I be then?" "Ninety-nine." Pooh nodded. "I promise," he said.   Taylor's Good Food cafe also had the above to offer.

      cracked me up completely. to see it being written in ink in earnest, so carefully, made my day actually. Love Feruze, and her aunt and uncle. 7th July it is, then.  Shouldnt have indulged in needless walnut brownie after oath from a few weeks back. And conscious work of art, is cafe latte and cafe mocha at Joe the Art of Coffee. Whether this becomes haunt for the next couple of months, I wait to see, with bated breath.   Lots of conversation on teh phone with people sincerely trying to help. Appreciated it, but of course the slog is upto me. never said I wasnt up for the challenge. Housing is next on the list, and will probably have to visit Claremont to check out affordable places.  What bugs me the most is people never grasping how adversely their concern manifest as panic affects me. Ok futile thread this, so will skip this. I will be the stronger one and ignore this and distance myself from it to function as productively as possible.  I live on what I understand is a healthy dose of denial. Why else would I stop Feruze from pondering about life sustained by email interaction between two ends of the world?  Also, probably because you have already reconciled to such a conditioned way of life.  SO teh saddest news of today is that India trip has no scope of materialising before December...dec???????????????? getting back to denial.....  Giving a talk next week. About time too. On the fake transfer of power in Iraq. have an enormous amount on my plate, but have decided to go for it. good talking to Brian today, cleared up some key perspectives. looking forward to writing it Saturday. not have  one inch of time before that.  Murphy somehow Will squeeze in to spice things up for me.  further confirmation comes from fact that I get invited to New Jersey the very same day Ani might be coming to NY. Second time I am presented with opportunity to Prioritise (different)friend over (same) family in less than a month's time. Bizaaaaarre. Well not like I ever claimed to be a family person. Seriously, trite conversation not worth the bus journey. Weighing that against winded walks around the Village or wherever else for that matter. So Easy it is too.           Meanwhile the pile of pending work mounts higher and higher.  Reminders for tomorrow: pay bill, call people about news, call student financing office, look up local newspapers for housing.  And was just mesasaged about friend's relapsed sex life, with assurances of further notes. Would happily like to mind my own business, though.   "So I'll just keep on walking down this open road" Closing with Gary Barlow, ie   Not quite strange that this be the refrain for the day.

      So Claremont happened ! YEAH! Im still in shock, btw now money situation to be tackled, oh well, one at a time please, before you drive yourself completely nuts.  Chicago etc were absolute riots. tripped out everywhere, lots of drink, but handled so impressively. Met Pakistani, who has to be called about Coalition meeting next week. I would have liked to work at his agency though. Shelley's revolutionary poetry talk and subsequent discussion with David and Maya had me in tears, why Im not sure. Probably because Im on teh right path only. Ooooh and 80s disco, so out of the blue and so appreciated. I like Nathan also, he is quiet sort who acknowledges most everything. Helped him decipher crucial reference to Mask of Anarchy. Proud. Conversation(s) with Bill Keach also a delight. those were the defining moments.  Met Frenchwoman who will contact me during her NY trip. Dekalb was fantastic, loooved night out in the woods. Duck groaning and policeman prowling about notwithstanding.   too bad I lost one of my lenses teh next day, but we made up nicely, Sohini and me (should I forgive people so effortlessly..). But there emerges another excuse to go to Calcutta. will post those b&w pictures as well. I love me in b & w. Spooky pic of Suchitrita and me likens ghost sequence in Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne.   People continuously paying me in cash in public bus was a bit embarrassing, for several reasons. I had no idea what they were doing. I also had no idea we were going dutch. Something to think about.  Evanston is truly pretty. Kafein was great and being thrown out of there at closing time, happily reminds of similar fun times in the pleasant past. Shakespeare's garden was such a waste, but so lovely. Ani is a merry tourist guide. lake Michigan behind rocks in almost pitch darkness brought back first offcial epic poem. Did a patch of Chicago today morning, and observatory was a swell idea. I love the blue-green of the lake. Also concluded I do not like martinis. Some shop called Seven Seven Seven made me laugh.    I Am tireless.  And what of when I get back, hungry, pissed after delayed flight, just wanting some decent conversation?  Bombarded with questions about funding and admissions and explanations and followups to be done.  There I went thinking I now have an inch of breathing space. it's like nothing has changed. taking time off to celebrate would have made more sense, no? Especially after months of numbness and distractions galore. Pretty mad with Baba for doing this to me. good I will finally be moving out, it is much needed and has to happen before I screw up relationship with my parents totally. How we manage I dont know.  go to sleep now, you are tired and sleepy. work resumes tomorrow. have truckloads of which to wrap up in a couple of month's time.  but I do know what I want to do for birthday.

      is the reality check that was today. Ok that is misleading, am very much aware of goings-on around but today was unexpected, and of the sort you're wary of.  So the news of teh day is, I will have no place to stay in like 2 months. Everyone going back home in August. Will also have no job in less than a month's time.  So why am I so detached from my life, still? well, actually you're not, cuz you're too busy Living your life.  Claremont has me hanging by a thread about to snap. the edge is where I am. There's just so much I can humanly do. Thus went the latter part of the day.  good thing I got work done earlier, before the news was dropped. trainride back home was uneventful except for hep bangladeshi woman talking in bangladeshi bangla and indian man on cellphone rambling on in very bad english. oh and same woman on train earlier was standing next to me.   Met Jenny, her concern touches me. Good talking outside Cupping Room Village, another one crossed off the list. She made me laugh with her very recent discovery of her relatives in the US. I was talking too much. I love dogs, especially the small, brown one smaller and cuter than a fox. have to find out what breed it is.  Got thoroughly disracted at Jembro, though it was worth the splurge. Me highly-strung was the reason. Should never let people sway me into making decisions, even her. Have sworn never to take the F train back from West 4th again. Twice bitten.  Hopefully Chicago will afford more distractions for the next 6 days. Still havent read stuff for the workshops, hate that Im neglecting those. remember to carry Leon Trotsky's essays book. Hope to get some reading done during flight. Sanity still sought, so this should be a well-earned time-out.   Soundtrack for today: West End Girls via Pet Shop Boys. Funny.  And am numb waist down to toe for the last few days. This freaking weather...  Have so much to write, but am so pressed for time.  Will go hunt for bag to take now.

      Blissful at the beach, that's what I was today. had almost forgotten how much of a sea-person I am. Mountains do feature, and I do get lost in them, but there's a dynamic about the ocean that touches parts nothing else can. will dedicate more time to it.  Fleeting thoughts arose, namely this was a full circle. The beach is where I began, and now Ive returned to it. Always remember and acknowledge your roots. There is a lot of unfinished business to be taken care of. I am sincerely thankful for that which started me off. it will linger as images do.  Forgetting my camera was fate leading me to those glory days. Could concentrate more on myself, for one. Also played with bright green seaweed and dull grey gulls. Liked myself on that rock. Felt an overgrown patch of moss on dead wood. Sand below the feet was comfort forgotten for long. No resistance offered, just sinking me in. I shouldnt wear shoes.  Turkish coffee on way back ensured another addition to list of places to be explored further.   Sandy.

      Was a smash hit. Everyone gelled fantastically. L'annam was a success, great service, over-zealous waiter, good food, drinks even better My camera almost let us down, but pulled it off.trippy pics the result. Deborah L Coates should be proud to have a bunch of such diligent associates, toasts to her for bringing us all together for teh time of our lives.   Coffee Shop, my recommendation again (yeah, yeah!!) was the icing. Underground lounge got headier as the night carried on. Thank god talked people out of the movie idea. I will maintain for the rest of my life, that nothing eases the bonding process better than alcohol, and bottlesful of it. Several blue parrots, mojitos, ginger kazzis and chocolate martinis made teh night, as everyone recounted their 'horror stories' to each others' delight. such a common thread there. Why do these things happen to good souls....dancing good too. And Ishtar's bi as well, something I didnt see coming.   I have now confirmation of what stuff people perceive Im made of..."I think it's beautiful you can say 'I dont know' like that.." cheers to you michael, and everyone else for reiterating that, after my vague allusion to my future. I am such a loon.  Also died as I realised time had come for yet another round of goodbyes... Got very emotional when Michael wondered when he'll see me again, very unanticiapted and blew me off course completely, wept like a baby. It hadnt occured to me that this was a last time of sorts.   Point is we killed all last night. And will happen again. Pictures prove my point.

      Oh what a day, loads of work done and am kind of beat, not like it's over for tonight though. So this is a break, then.  have cover letters to write, which I soooo hate, but whatever. Glad Chicago trip is finally taking shape. Good fun with Suchitrita/Sohini/Ani lies ahead, not to mention teh conference. Greatly confused about workshops to attend, but will be a last-minute thing as ever. Hope hotel is in a good location, meaning there are decent plcs to eat/drink around. DO I know how to get to dekalb from chicago..no. will figure out. Remind me to remind Sohini about visiting that nice coffee plc on teh way to downtown Dekalb.   Lovely weather today, been anticipating the rain all day, but no one missed it when it never showed up. Took vague pics of skies and trees, just remembered to upload them. Might write something too.   Love 99 cents stores, they are crammed with goodies you cannot even imagine unless you allocate time to rummage through them. Got mug with Hai Xin and green/white pandas on it. Disappointed that Hai Xin is jsut the company name...what a let down. then there's teh music or the strange mish-mash of it that customers were being bombarded with.  I saw the birds (thoroughly unimpressive, brown hanging ones) that were squeaking out of tune. One of those other annoying show-pieces were, as is routine, churning out teh Dr Zhivago theme. There was also a Chinese singer crooning, with brief interludes by a mooing cow. Simultaneously.   Ironically I now have slippers which say California Girl Sport.        Saw woman trying to coerce her man into waxing!!!!! something, somewhere...what a nut! Poor guy.     People are straaaange. I am not drunk.

      Lovers’ Song  Lovers’ song there is none No music to lead from Except the notes that bind No matter in the mind As long as life’s afloat  Can’t ensure a steady boat But lovers recognise The best course to explore And plod away at oars Calming the tides. When Storm signals cry out The chuckling abounds To welcome drowning gusts     And feed into the tumult Till lovers exhausted and spent  And damage a trivial dent On the way to salvage and protect And effortlessly put to effect A funnily simple prelude To a resounding tune Till date unheard and unsung By lovers’ lips and tongue.

      hmmm just when you thought you were managing, people descend on you and upset the healthy trend. Why people do not understand or why they care so much is beyond me. is this another reality check, well definitely feels like am in there. Wish I had an older bro/sis to tell me of the nuances of the world outside of my head. Since that's never coming true, let;s get back to what you have to do. Do it, ie. ok I have got myself a pair of decent, comfy shoes today and will continue from there. maybe I should just explain to people that I can live with glaring uncertainty, and they need not worry about me, which can potentially translate to worrying me.    And adding to usual pains is cable connection utterly messed up, I will die without the internet, dependency sucks.    Bittersweet symphony featured somewhere today and has again confirmed why Richard Ashcroft is god.    'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, that's life Try to make ends meet You're a slave to money then you die I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down You know the one that takes you to the places  where all the veins meet yeah,   No change, I can change I can change, I can change But I'm here in my mold I am here in my mold But I'm a million different people  from one day to the next I can't change my mold No, no, no, no, no  Well I never pray But tonight I'm on my knees yeah I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now But the airways are clean and there's nobody singing to me now  No change, I can change I can change, I can change But I'm here in my mold I am here in my mold And I'm a million different people from one day to the next I can't change my mold No, no, no, no, no I can't change I can't change

      things started vaguely this evening, do not appreciate attitude problems especially when you're giving clear-cut directions to a plc right across the street. So fine Esperanto Cafe isnt written in neon signs, but if I tell you to cross the street, you do so instead of walking away.  It is in this context that I dont like being made to think it's my fault you cant find a freaking coffee shop. ok the rest of the time was fine, in fact great fun, would have flirted more with waiter if he had been less stud-like. huh, interesting. roomali ensured chicken tikka roll be dinner. falafel for next week then. the pan shop will continue to freak me. madras mahal seemed cool, have to visit too.  thai playboys and red devils happened, all of which got me very happy, everyone acknowledged there was no one to take care of me. I miss tarun and car after such blissful episodes. I love yumiko drunk. her friend already thinking of me going to japan was startling to say the least.  Got u2 poster too, of them so young, and interview done too. Will post pics soon.    Im a bit shocked that Im so detached as with or without you carries on.

      am soooo tired and sleepy, whole day in the sun does that to you hated clinton's speech, hated potential stampede to shake his hands even more. Why am I always caught in the middle of stuff I want to stay away from? Soul food happened, and crabcake and jamaican rice were the highlights. I love Harlem. got pics of bday in 2003, delays kill me.

      Meeting was a blast, Michael, Ishtar and me cracked each other up, not uncharacteristically. We make such a wonderful team, the "dynamics" of which took me a while to grasp. And I honestly didnt realise how rampant teh practice of imitating my 'yeahs' is. (I, of course do not understand this)  Best part: this is what happens when Rupu leads team meetings. AS we acknowledged, covered everything on agenda, and so much more. Made considerable progress with subsequent work as well.  Next stop, next week: L'anaam (vietnamese) on 3rd Ave & 28th Street, looking forward to meeting all our colleagues there, but just the 3 of us will do as well.   Spoke to Tito..at last... tkts seem to be on teh way too, things finally moving. good to make Bong connection here, hoping things will work out. Wish I had learnt about the art camp a day earlier.  And overheard Dwaine muttering quite happily about the virtues of his hot stick to his gf over teh phone, right behind me. Which was funny. His voice went down to eerily muffled whispers soon after. Which wasn't. had no clue they were such a hot item.  That was Michael's contribution today, to all future conversation in the lab - hot stick what he dubbed the USB drive that's gleefully replacing the floppy.

      I Saw the Sun Rise on the 7 Train  I saw the sun rise on the 7 train I saw the ink turn into blue I saw the moon fall on the 7 train I saw the orange give way to sky I saw the white catch up  With the dawning day And spread over the patch anew I saw the dawn transform itself From blackness pitch dark  To sailor’s shade To clear Danube behind the trees To bloodstains capturing heavenly birth Masked solemn by traces of sun An azure greeting the sleepy nods As crimson leads forces of daybreak This unassuming work of art exhibited Brushes in joys of the day awaited As cobalt over steel, rests its case.

      Chicken Shakuti II (chicken cooked in coconut)  Ingredients  1Kg chicken, cut into desired pieces (or or off the bone) Dry roast the following in a large pan (until coconut is a light brown,  taking care not to burn the spices):  2 tsp coriander seeds  8 dried Kashmiri chilies  1/2 tsp cumin seeds  1 tsp fenugreek seeds  5 peppercorns  2 tsp peanuts (unsalted)  1/2 coconut, grated  1 tsp turmeric  4 cardamoms  6 cloves  1 inch piece of cinnamon  1 lemon  salt to taste    Method  Add the turmeric, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon to the roasted spices and  finely grind. Fry the spice mixture in some ghee for a few minutes. Add the  chicken and brown. Add salt and a little water and simmer until chicken is  cooked. Sprinkle over lemon juice a few minutes before serving.   Well this is just a lame attempt to let you take a whiff of the heavenly scent of the above combination of spices.  It is proshaad in its purest form, almost untouchable in its beauty.  High-inducing, orgasmic...I can live in a roomful of this aroma forever. Ask me to cook it, and I will do so joyously, creating it just makes it my baby which is the entire point. Cooking for the ecstacy of cooking, where have I ever heard that before? Resting my case for the day.

Ok cell phones have so much potential, yet they end up adding to your agony. How many ppl do I have to talk to now..bet they'll all call at the same time. Like Murphy and technology ganging up against you. Things get progressively crazier as the day moves on. Will post I saw sunrise..

      http://www.nysonglines.com/  is THE site to check out for your trip to ny, still havent gotten over it and am still languishing in the discovery of it.  ok according to my printout there was this place on Christopher Street which is called Fat Cat Billi, possibly a place for World Clothing   was too excited! and such a brilliant choice of words.  found it. ALso found it to be jazz bar called Fat Cat with Billiards table, etc.  too bad Yumiko didnt happen to know Hindi to appreciate and join in my hysteria.   oh, my printout had cut off the right end of the page  NY story 1

      The Screening Room: Donau, Dunaj, Duna, Dunav, Dunareva  Directed by Goran Rebic, 2003, German with English subtitles, 90 min. (fiction/drama)  Cast: Otto Sander, Robert Stadlober, Annabelle Mandeg, Svetozar Cvetkovic,Florin Piersic jr., Volodymir Goryansky  For the last time the old Captain Franz navigates his rusty ship down the Danube to the Black Sea. On board is an odd mix of people. All are runaways but for different reasons. We are all made of 90 percent water. How much of it is tears? Or Danube?   mystery solved   Wonderfully attractive actors. Lovely photography...every shade of blue, all times of the day.  when people start talking to you about Satyajit Ray in the Austrian cultural forum, it has to spell out a delightful evening   Also added to list of my apparent origins is German.  others so far... Spanish Caribbean Egyptian French (ok...) Iraqi Bangladeshi(sooo close..)

      Now that my god is up here as well, the place feels a bit more homey, and so can dig into it.  Played phone tag with brian the whole day...hopefully will get to talk tomorrow. Am now excited about the stoop sale, looks to be fun, should figure out when I can sort out items to donate from the mess that is my room.  I need plane tickets badly, I still dont have them. why cant ppl return calls so I can talk to them and figure my plans (however unplanned) out...    tomorrow will get royally crazy as well, hopefully i will remember I have interview at 4, meeting at 2 and ceremony tkts to pick up sometime before that. I dont want to hear Bill Clinton anyway. Such a waste of time it'll be. Now that my last month of work is drawing to a close, Im edgy about forfeiting even an hour of work... after which I might have to spend time with her in vague, uncomfortable silence. god, the conv today, initiated by me why I dont know, was so freaking straaaained. So Saturday's going to be fun, actually it will, there'll be others around too, and alcohol and music will help.   look forward to more ny stories here, oh and the moonlight cruise. Send poems to stanley, you forgetful girl....

      Reasons why I don't smoke:   *&nbsp;mouth&nbsp;will smell  * clothes will reek  *&nbsp;teeth will get yellower&nbsp;  *&nbsp;cannot bear to smoke into others unflinchingly  * cannot have people associate me with&nbsp;reek of nicotine  * cannot impose foul-smelling mouth on others (gum makes me nauseous)  * am not so insensitive to others' discomfort  * too expensive a deal, have more fun&nbsp;priorities to splurge on  * health hazards   thus gave jenny advice on how to quit. she's trying too, good girl. Stress is such a killing factor. we decided to&nbsp;work within constraints as best possible. Counseling experience from Obesity Research Center, St Lukes Hospital&nbsp;was&nbsp; put to ample use, (memories of food records and rigid discipline&nbsp;came along) glad to have applied it in real life.&nbsp;Gradually easing it down is best and makes most sense.  Let's see progress, should keep checking up regularly.  will also&nbsp;ask Baba what he had done teh 5 months of his adult life&nbsp;to turn into a non-smoker.Will serve several purposes. maybe&nbsp;should have done this long time ago, but somehow&nbsp;am not motivated to help those&nbsp;seemingly unconcerned themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  have decided to spend one whole day losing myself in alleyways of west village.  panino giusto&nbsp;makes a great cafe latte, and&nbsp;made it cooler&nbsp;by dunking in brimful of cinnamon.  ended up sitting outside and scribbling&nbsp;random thoughts&nbsp;with our left hands in turns. My sentences&nbsp;ran diagonally along the page, though the leters were wellformed and steady. practice has done me good, have also taken notes with left hand, to kill monotony, among other things.  the bathroom reminded me of a cottage in rural europe, brick walls, flagstone floor, huge, aging mirror in frayed wooden frame, in about nine square feet of space. quite mesmerised.  feruze leaves for albania tomorrow, excited for her. know most people arent, about my trip to calcutta, but will hang on to wishes of those who are.  nidhisaraf will take leave from work to&nbsp;go if I do.&nbsp;her&nbsp;boss thinks&nbsp;she will be visiting her boyfriend.&nbsp;flattered. and also sad. such is the state of the world that recognises the&nbsp;urgency to make cross-country trips for the sake of a 'significant other', a definition excluding friends. Friendship is the single most abused relationship pragmatically. tirade ends here.   just read article on how more people in hongkong die&nbsp;due to lack of exercise than smoking.  does that discount the risks of smoking? no.&nbsp;no mention of smokers who also exercise either.&nbsp;   saw play called 'a louisiana gentleman' yesterday. actor looked like keanu reaves and actress like  helen hunt. winding plot with&nbsp;rosy end. about new orleans man dealing with&nbsp;snooty aunt, neglected wife and paranoid sister.   bronx zoo tomorrow, if weather permits. I operate despite it.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;

      So it happened.  I Ran Away floated in out of the blue and messed me up. About time, no? Fleeting&nbsp;visions of walks&nbsp;around grand central in the winter cold, probably&nbsp;headed towards Book Off reminded me what that song meant to me. THAT is what Im going to miss about this place.&nbsp; anyway major amount of work done today - when&nbsp;am I ever going to find the time to pack?? I should just declare I dont have time to work anymore. Am I only one who doesnt find&nbsp;my pending work schedule strange and ill-timed? Breathing space there&nbsp;is none. As nidhisaraf acknowledged the biggest fish who "..occasionally comes up for air, but is usually underwater.." We shall push luck&nbsp;for a ray street reunion. Darling she&nbsp;called on sunday&nbsp;as did Simran :)&nbsp; oh speaking of when, Beach was marvellous under clouds, rain and wind. Kafe Shashlychnaya was over-rated&nbsp;we all felt, but I liked my chicken stroganoff with dill. my eastern-european penchant is still on. anyway funny&nbsp;how there was no one at the table from teh same country. this is the life. ok only till asif showed up. people should have dunked me into teh water, a little more insistence would have gone a long way into the waves. and I havent called leo about next meet-up,&nbsp;felt bad we left&nbsp;shortly after he&nbsp;came along. have to make up for&nbsp;that.&nbsp; so i broke my vow and all also. had to crash at laura's place, asif and me. I missed the name of the&nbsp;bar yet again. I can now discern between two separate states leading to different outcomes during bingeing episodes.&nbsp;Cool conversations of course. Too bad couldnt show people the roll shop next door. ok pictures have to be uploaded. bday girl was happy, though. Impressed with small talk&nbsp;and breakfast I had to make next morning with cousin dadu-dida at&nbsp;home,&nbsp;while nursing severe hangover. I think discussing sightseeing in new york eased the process.&nbsp;  cant believe how immune I am to wowy. I am an objective listener now hahahahaha laura is an amazingly social creature, quite adore her. hope I get to meet her again before I leave. asif has treat due also. 125th street was abuzz with passers-by yesterday, was so glad I went. Uplifting talking to lady from reserves and the guy from the Guardian angels, with freaky white lenses and vampire teeth.  and&nbsp;aditi's getting married in&nbsp;oct,&nbsp;in&nbsp;montana!!!! and she wants me there, cool ;) will make it to bozeman then. My first (semi)american wedding. Closer to claremont than new york, it is. went to bon appetit&nbsp;bakery/cafe Twice today, you bad, bad girl. Addictions do catch up.&nbsp;&nbsp;  will&nbsp;I be able to reach rockefeller center&nbsp;at 7 am on fri, is the question, pondering over which will be pointless.  I&nbsp;badly want to go to the bronx zoo. (waaah!)  have to find presi marksheet now. something tells me I wont find it tonight.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      My journey began in Calcutta, being the first and last-born of my parents. My schooling was at Our Lady Queen of the Missions School and subsequently at La Martiniere for Girls. After an academically uncertain, yet intellectually stimulating undergraduate experience studying Economics at Presidency College, it was evident this was not my calling. As my family moved to New York at this point, I considered an M.A. in Psychology, a subject I was vaguely familiar with, yet infinitely curious about. As I matured enough to decide my consequent path, I was grateful to Presidency College for advancing my growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three years of studying various facets of Psychology, supplemented by fieldwork and research, I look forward to beginning a Ph.D. programme in Social Psychology. This encompasses human behaviour and cognition in every aspect of life, and delving deeper into it would be remarkably fulfilling. Research I have been involved in, though not touching upon social psychology directly, has consistently presented questions whose answers require a social perspective. Diverse experiences have convinced me to study this more intensively, which I endeavour doing at Claremont Graduate University (CGU). The practical applications of this programme in the real world, to influence people’s lives beyond the experimental laboratory, I wish to utilise back home in India.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Environmental psychology, deftly linking social psychology and our environment intrigues me. Social concerns are effectively addressed when also acknowledging&nbsp; environmental constraints, requiring an understanding of the psychology of the larger community. Society fragmented into cultural groups, as in India, will usually have different environmental concerns. The Indian sub-continent, an amalgamation of cultures, presents conflicting interests and a pressing need to bridge gaps between divergent norms of each. Repercussions of these are felt particularly while broaching environmental matters as well, due to needs from cultural points of view. CGU will provide me with the tools and methodology to address this by also focusing on the common threads between various groups under the national banner. Emphasis on group relationships should not only be on how they manifest, but also on ways to unravel why they are so, for a greater environmental goal.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The appeal of an applied Social Psychology programme to me then, is its potential in India, where the field of psychology is in a relatively fledgling state. Research especially within social psychological contexts to understand and shape public policy in India, I perceive as an eventual focus. In terms of environmental issues, a broader framework of our surroundings and the diverse inhabitants of the community can refine addressal of environmental concerns. This is very important given the wealth of natural resources and a corresponding multitude of cultures in the sub-continent. With ample scope of exploitation of such valuable assets available to a wider community, it becomes crucial to handle such matters of public interest, politically and scientifically. My intention is also to affect these national issues professionally.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the future I am investing in at Claremont Graduate University with the hope of equipping myself appropriately for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      This was the find of today:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    urlLink http://www.mihaieminescu.ro/en/literary_work/poems/gloss.htm &nbsp; (trying to figure out link..) &nbsp;  Gloss  by Romanian Romantic poet&nbsp;Mihai Eminescu. A mere translation, but what can one do, apart from learning Romanian, as was acknowleged.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fellow passenger in train engrossed in&nbsp;it, caught my attention and hence conversation ensued, he will email me more about him, but&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;resist the search.&nbsp;He wanted me to read it during the&nbsp;ride, but was amply distracted. the first line I read which&nbsp;determined the&nbsp;next was "...Waves that leap like waves must fall.."  Note the curious style carried over from the first verse onto the subsequent ones. Thoroughly impressed and blissfully happy. I wait.  &nbsp;  Ups and downs of the day did me in.&nbsp;Cracked under pressure a few hours ago, was pending, too.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  "...The ups and downs of expectations  I can't take any more,  They just end up killing me.."  &nbsp;  another poet,&nbsp;this.  &nbsp;  Loan is driving me up the wall. Endless&nbsp;clarification with a bunch of different people who&nbsp;provide&nbsp;disconnected,&nbsp;confusing&nbsp;information. Customer services quite hopeless. I will warn people against approaching this agency, for their sanity's sake. Spent a fruitless week chasing a lost cause. Now start all over again, wiht trip to New Jersey. and as ever weekend's &nbsp;in the way. Have to forfeit&nbsp;the Siren festival because&nbsp;of last minute trip.  Cina, a Romanian place in Astoria will ease the agony, slightly.  &nbsp;  But let's not forget, have to now&nbsp;Watch the movie Zorba the Greek.&nbsp;have just started&nbsp;to read, but waiter at fancy cafe Chez le Chef tipped me off. Pleasant, very pleasant.&nbsp;Probably the South Asian connection.&nbsp;Too bad won't be revisiting. Turned out to be my respite after 30 blocks of walking down Lexington. Chef Frederic looks like Santa Claus in white.  &nbsp;  Culinary explorations continue as&nbsp;this new face&nbsp;on MacDougal, by the name&nbsp;of Press Toast&nbsp;caught me totally unawares and filled me up to the brim.&nbsp;Bread toasted flat&nbsp;with mashed avocado...will never ever underestimate size again.  &nbsp;  Oh and then&nbsp;the other&nbsp;addition to list of complications.&nbsp;Eye doctor found unexplained inflammations in my&nbsp;eye and&nbsp;thus wants&nbsp;full check up done. So am now punctured all over&nbsp;after blood tests and other&nbsp;needless exams. Doctors more&nbsp;bothered than me.&nbsp;From the point of view of insurance, quite understandable, but I wouldnt&nbsp;count on&nbsp;him for moral and/or emotional&nbsp;support during an actual crisis.  Doctors&nbsp;greet you with the likes of "So you're very worried about&nbsp;the inflammations..".  &nbsp;  Anyway, so am apparently free of tubercular infection, syphilis, neurological diseases and some other such nonsense. Blood test results should add more to list. Chest x-ray was uneventful except me&nbsp;making a futile&nbsp;attempt to convince&nbsp;fellow-in-charge that&nbsp;exposure cannot harm a&nbsp;non-existent fetus.  The nuances&nbsp;of the medical system, I wouldnt have escaped from, for too much longer, anyway.  Not done yet, though.  &nbsp;  Want Sunday to bring in fair weather.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      The welcoming openness Of limitless possibilities  Played back and forth by gentle tides Catalysed by soothing crispy winds Sweeping you off your toes Tiredness of feet alone While alive the reincarnated soul Elusive what is touched by the sea  Just felt within, so out of human reach  So springs forth lost trails To comfortvilles and cosy inns The travels etched  On sand concrete  A full circle turns to bring back home Thoughts of roots of all the passing tales And what paved the eventful, glorious way Sand beneath the sole sinks it in Transient all, from head to toe Waves dying to caress the feet Remind of what sustains, preserves All that’s been a staple source Of a hazy glimpse of earthly heaven Seaweed, bright green or dirty brown  An exploration of a touch of new  As fingers slide and snake surfaces Refreshed with ocean water cool     From tugs and calls beyond end of land Drifting pieces of broken wood beckon Frayed and withered after sojourns long Gulls playful, of the patient sort Who know sea ways and the open life Of what it is to be free-spirit-kind  Unhindered by none  But gales of time Flight to be prioritised Sands, winds and waves  Hail a boisterous encore.

      Stumbled upon reason why Ma is so averse to my Calcutta trip. She doesnt want to give up on time with me around. After a long conversation over the wires, in the middle of the workday (both hers and mine) this was explicitly made evident to me. Great job, you budding psychologist, you. First of all, as I pointed out, since she's so convinced it's not practically possible, there's no reason for her to get so worked up with the very thought. Of course, the consequent effect on me is not yet clear to her.   may be visiting Claremont as early as next Tues. Subject to response from Angela Burwick and availability of affordable tkt. Apartment hunting, the intention. Checked out some plcs, glad Michael sent list of pet-friendly apts also. good conversation, that. if it hadnt been for the last-minute-stigma in my life, could have coordinated with him about transporting stuff across.  There were more options and I dont mind other people's animals. oh and some of them have pool also :)  Tripped around downtown later in the evening. Gushing fountain at washington sqr a far cry from its waterless state a year ago. Different times, these. Ticked off Polka Dot from list. Not impressed. Music alone has no weightage. Coffee, not unusually memorable (explaining my very late early hours tonight) and seating arrangement lacking in creativity.  Looked for cheap Set List cd. will push luck further in east village tomorrow. The Frames have to be obtained. Went to same cool store on bleecker, where I got b&w u2 poster from their earlier heydays. if I do go to Calcutta, am getting it framed :)  Sushila has probably decided not to reply to my email that explained total uncertainty of trip. Am short of travel agent too, then.  Work stares me in the face teh whole day tomorrow, let's try and allot time priority-wise. Will meet Asif for dinner tomorrow, happy things are working out for us. lived through days of unbearable (and in a way unfelt) anxiety the last few months. no breathing space in sight yet, though :)) Cant wait to come up for some air.    Been asked out on car-trip to wherever, next week. Adding to complications.  I wait, for next weekend.

      Work can be fun. Woke up to pending reports, only to get cracking on them. Which ensured conversation with Saurav online, which will make me rethink aspects I had taken for granted. Like I mentioned, it was trippy and has to be continued. Got a nasty shock about new I-20 rules, which could potentially have had me pay an extra hundred bucks after Aug. They spring new regulations on you without batting an eyelid. such fuckers. thankfully turned out not applicable to transfer students like myself, so spared, but there are others who won't be. hated parting with walking tour guidebook of lower east side. But what to do, am heaped in library fines due since whenever. why is this an inevitable fate??? Ok people are asking me how Im doing with 'idea' of parting with NY.  Nothing has registered regarding which as yet, that is great. Attachments are easily displaced hahahahahahaha Also, it's just a City. She laughs again. And then amidst grave doubts about it ever materialising, Sting concert was a major event. I cant even remember when I got tkts. Excursion to NJ quite worth it, with most everything spelling doom, namely possibilities of me misreading date/time, getting into wrong train, missing train, etc etc  Almost super organising flop, but last minute ruled, so smoothly it went. Annie Lennox opening paved the way, she is a cool cat and love her as well. WHY nagged the life out of me till the opening strains were heard.  Sting took over shortly. Man is aging noticeably. Voice still intact though. feruze and me both cried during Fields of Gold. Everytime. Im a sucker for music. Didnt want to leave stage also, twice he came back...that's my kind of performer ;)  Dreamt of Dimma last night, in Selimpore. Typical. Someone was giving her blue flowers about which she was complaining. Again, predictable. Im told this is not something I should be seeing. Given a choice of dreams... anyway, this makes more urgent trip to Calcutta, which is up in the clouds. then Jenny left voicemail complaining(?) I hadnt sent her poem. what is happening, I wonder.  head spinning now.  legal alien

      Closure happens never at all However convincing may be Thwarting just those very thoughts That were banished carefully Not after violin strains  Play strands handpicked  From a charmed life Of words echoing the very words You didn't need yourself to hear Faces of old glistening in the light Tears, an inevitable plight As revelations mark this while And pound and bruise inside Endlessly raining on Reminds of memories  Shunned, misunderstood Or fathomed not at all. Dark, lonesome lakes And gardens green Masked by shadows of darkened times Into muted grey they turn Of nooks unused Undisturbed Peaceful calm, they still exude. Tireless walks gently tugging along Images unmoved, preserved. The first perhaps will be the last The first will revive the past Emerging at the end of last. What conjured into demons scoffed Now warped back to merry sights. Music overwhelms and flows Into veins, replacing life-blood Pumps and charges and devours Every inch of a naïve soul Whispers of heydays, bombard And puncture, at first and every strike While the sounds trickle in. Frames flash by at battering speed As the music rocks on   Frames pictures Suddenly restored, renewed Closure is a mere myth.

      A week's worth summarised here? not quite likely, as last night still overshadows others. So, found out about yet another Irish band, The Frames, (www.theframes.ie) and they performed at South St Seaport as ever. Got massively killed. Cried through seventyfive percent of concert time, and now have to get cds. they were sold out.  Dont get me wrong, theyre a rock band, a real rocking one, but there's also a violinist, by god. Do I neeed anything more...apparently not.   then, Soma's in NY ??!!!! shocked out of my senses, words.. so going to meet her today. Have to figure out how to address fact that her mail from feb, I believe, is still unanswered.    Then talk on Wed went off rather well. Was proud of me. Wrap-up wasn't a breeze, but was handled.   Still harbouring thoughts of Calcutta materialising. Will have to keep on trying luck. time is the freaking constraint. let's try to get housing taken care of this month and fees semi-fixed. do i visit Claremont now, as well? Should ask them whether it is worth the effort. Also need to get moving with driving license. Miscellaneous committments as far as get-togethers and trips right here. nothing more than a reminder for me, this.  there hasnt been much space or time to reflect on life after new york. No complaints there, though :)) When it rains, it pours... or words to such effect.  What makes a song great?  its ability to tear you apart and force you to connect with not-so salient aspects of your life, for one. Especially those, you didnt quite think existed.   also if it leads to further outbursts of creativity.  ladies and gentlemen, The Frames.

      you're not a new yorker if you don't run along the crosswalk after the last minute, if you couldn't not care less of the waiting vehicle, if you don't have the patience or the time to wait for the small, white man, if the red hand serves you better. you're not a new yorker if you aren't always in a rush, if your destination isn't more urgent than anyone else's, if the world outside your head doesn't flash by you in streaks of colour indiscernible. you're not a new yorker if you bat an eyelid at anything out of the mundane, hell nothing deserves such bewilderment. you're not a new yorker if your threshold of tolerance isn't constantly on the dip, reaching levels unfelt or otherwise. if this is reinforcing that snooty stereotype then so be it, cuz its true. not all of us are bad though; apart from the several wonderfully interesting strangers Ive encountered, am a living example of this fact. Survivors, shall we say, we are, whatever and whoever the enemy. So it is that time of the story again, when a large chunk of reality bashes me in the face. Life after, will be a toughie and could hinge on rather detrimental consequences. dont know what brought this about: Conv with delphine, whose book I have to return, perhaps. I dont know what Im going to do without the ISO, HAVE to join the LA branch eventually. being out on teh streets does this to me, just the potential kills me. will feel helpless without it. let me see how I'll manage this. Tuesday evening then, will be very hectic. Stranger on 125th and lex said he was getting distracted by the whitehead on my lip which I should pop, well not exactly stranger, was arguing with him for a while about the intent of the ISO's endorsement of the nader campaign. lost patience at end. told him not to. mcdougal street, the second option: one of teh best lattes at cafe esperanto.. will trip out with jenny tomorrow. will forgo street theatre to get work done at home, so I feel less guilty about prioritising pleasure over responsibilities. Or group in subway crooning to tune of 'land down under' by men at work. good version with guitar, tambourine and vocals only. maybe the awesome weather as well, I love winds that mess up my hair far more professionally than I can ever do. By the time I reached duane reade, I was already severely tuned to my love affair with this city. hence it was routine to help fellow customer choose glasses for his wife/gf/partner/friend/relative. and why all of this drops in while Im sitting in the 7 train, I will never figure out. of course the chief culprit is 'let go'. so fine the theme is creepily similar to 'i ran away'. I cant help it if a song takes complete control of me. Im a receptor of unfathomable sensitivity. am also the most self-involved person I know. not of the selfish sort, but so freakingly aware of ins and outs of my self. this is the second song which has blown me to bits at first sound. am buying dvd of garden state. when will I see it again, I wonder. I should either not be left alone to my devices, or should not be allowed to listen to music or should have 'let go' be drained out of me. all impossible hahahahahahaha   so what should we do   THEN am about to forfeit 10 precious days of delving deeper into the city, thanks to calcutta trip. let's not remind ourselves of that trade-off, shall we. so essentially have approximately 10 days left in new york. so claremont has area called The village...some consolation, that. Some idiot also tried convincing me I'd "hate" LA after new york. what a jerk. good he featured for about 10 minutes of my life. denial sounds like a good proposition right about now. back to it as soon as I can. after thwarting people to think of future times, tsk tsk. cant wait to met jenny. what happened with us, I dont know. oh god... have to call smitesh also. slowly the list unfurls. kati rolls happen next week, hope asif drinks as many as he can over weekend, to me. I will too. Im done drinking tonight, have work also. Entertainment in evening took form of people at home discussing 'castes', especially in teh bong context. I wonder if I can pinpoint the line between the jokes and the seriousness. it quite shocks me at times. I was gleeful tonight because it was in reference to ranjini's multiple boyfriends. apparently dibakar still features, apart from strangenamed people like namit and some person who gives her rides back home. hear me rolling in laughter. I did speak to her though, and shut her up as she started with her trite concerns. wanted to know of gory details of chicago, at which point I impressively cut her short. Didn't get annoyed also. Score, pat on back, etc! oh bought laptop also, should be here by next friday. one less thing to worry about. How many people will I not be able to meet before I leave. One last thing, just wanted to acknowledge the historical date that is today. 6th august: going back to 1945, saw what in my books is the most heinous crime ever committed by man. in Hiroshima. have always been tremendously moved by the attrocity, and just like to take some time off, every year, to think of the fates of millions of innocent civilians in the hands of imperialism. oooh and 11th august is around the corner, have to celebrate my third and final year here. Crammed but fruitful week in sight.

      Had to write tonight. Am leaving work and other more pressing activities to get this done. House is full of aunts and hence might have to play hostess from time to time. Dislike the societal demand to be one. Anyway don’t digress from task at hand. Time is not on your side. Oh got ticket also, and have tucked it safely into drawer, and hopefully will not get lost in the stacks of paper inside. Should make everyone see where it is stashed. End of the mundane. Saw Garden State. Totally bombed and strangely subdued consequently. Freakishly impressed with Zach Braff: not One trace of J.D. from Sacred Hearts Memorial in Andrew Largeman returning to unanticipated reunion with friends old and new in NJ. Respect him madly now. Dude wrote  and  directed it. That’s one aspect of the impact. Brought back memories of deserts and isolation from all and sundry. Caravan trips into the unknown without a shred of fear or concern. All unreal. If that is where ultimate happiness lies, I am infinitely screwed. Soundtrack…hmmm still don’t know the track name, which got me hooked in the first place. Will seek out. Co-dependency is scary, but also such a refuge. Almost a haven which isn’t too bad a deal, come to think of it. Something to strive for, perhaps. I don’t like that I’m so moved by this. Really??? Seriously, this was a comedy. Just found Zach Braff blog. Cool. And sought after song is Let Go by Frou Frou. Will no doubt wake up tomorrow with this in head. Am not done with this theme as yet. Too distracted tonight. Botched up priorities are in any case getting to me.   So what should we do?
