      The energy of this place makes me crazy, both angry and insane.  All eight of us relocated in the house we grew up in. Eliyahu, Naftali, Tsiona, Ayelet and Aliza, not to mention the babies, Ema and Papa. I don't connect with the person who grew up here, mostly because that person was so disenfranchised. These days I feel quite the franchise, and, hoping somehow to make up for lost time, fail miserably. Getting dressed every morning is an ordeal. Morning coffee and cigarette must be taken locked in old bedroom. Nevertheless, She has calmed down and I'm not Her biggest problem. I have the sense that even She has come around to the humor of her situation. She is endlessly trying to sick her possy of manicurists and masseuses and waxers and make-up artists upon me, and sometimes I comply because then She inspects my eyebrows to make sure they are perfect, and stande very close to me and smiles very brightly if all is well.  Miriam, Anthony, Nadya, you are all on my mind from far away. Noam, Noam. Having lunch with Ari and Cippi, Cippi who married Ari because Naftali wouldn't marry her. They want to sit around and reminisce about old times in which each and every one of us was miserable. Why, oh why, I can't figure it out. Schreibman has called twice...How to avoid seeing these fascists.  Miss you all greatly.

      My boss where I waitress told me the most moving story yesterday. Picture this guy, Jay. He's Nigerian, but his mom is American. So his English is very mildly accented, but it's mildly Ebonicsy, and the two seem to overlap most of the time. He wears tasteful jewlery, and shoots the shit with everyone in a comfort-level that suggests ghetto familiarity; but he also keeps a distance more respectful than the more ghetto types. So he talks the talk, but there's something not quite right about his picture.  So I'm in between tables, and I ask him what his last name means, and he says it means "Let the world rest." He says his great-great-great etc. grandfather, about 10 generations back, was a warrior, and always the first to volunteer for war, so they would always bless him by saying, "Let the world rest," so he wouldn't be in danger. It became like a nickname for him, and then it became his last name. Anyway, this ancestor said that if any of his decendants ever needed anything, they could come and ask him, and he would help, even after he was dead. He was buried with a thick chain wraped around his body, and then he was lowered 69 feet into the ground, and the chain goes all that length, and sticks out of the ground where Mr. Let the world rest lies. Legend has it that if you are his ancestor, and you tug on that chain, he tugs back. "Does he?" I asked Jay. "Yes," he admitted, his voice small. "When I was a kid, it used to scare me..." Throughout the story, Jay's voice had the tone of one incredulous that he is actually&nbsp;uttering these words. I knew that I was the first person on this side of the rainbow to be hearing this story. It was all pretty unreal.

      Friday Night Alexander and Noam met. I, however, was too drunk to pull off anything graceful, and contented myself if not with a job well done, at least with a job not botched. Before the party, Noam and I went out for dinner with A. and N. Noam and I argued politics, me claiming that Israel and Palestine no longer need political intervention, and he arguing that giving back Gaza is a way of not giving back West Bank. Anthony, insecure at the castration of his ever present authority due to his ignorance of political issues, began to chide us for bickering. I looked at him and harshly told him he wasn't helpful, just as&nbsp;Noam, ever in search of a father figure, implored A. to help us. Dinner ended somewhat strained, Noam annoyed at my political views, me annoyed at his caving to A.'s pressure, and A. worried that I was pissed at him.  "Are you angry at me?" he asked when he and N. took us to our car.  "No. I feel to guilty about my harshness to be angry."  He said it rang true, and we agreed to meet sometime soon.  On the way back Noam and I decided to argue about politics rarely, and to do so respectfully. For example, it hurts him that I argue that Bush and Kerry are so similar because it entails that I don't think Bush is a jackass. I decided to preface any equalizing remarks with remarks about Bush's incompetence as a human being. Etc.   We went to visit Papa at Lake Bruce and sat on a dock and in a kayak. I had this image of my child sitting next to us spalshing its feet off the edge of the dock into the water, and saying to me, "Look, Ima, my feets are in the water!"   Tomorrow I'm going to Israel, and must remember to call and see everyone. It will take masterful negotiation not to see Aliza Schreibman who I don't mind hurting like that because she broke my heart a year ago in July, and again this year in June. I'm still smarting. I'll send Naftali over to see her.

      I have eaten  the plums that were in the icebox  and which you were probably saving  for breakfast  Forgive&nbsp;me they were delicious so sweet  and so cold  A poem&nbsp;by William Carlos Williams. And now, a poem by Batya: "This is just to say" :  I have stolen  the heart  that was beating in your chest  and which you were probably  saving for a better man  Forgive me it is contagious so sweet and so pure

      It's an age of forgotten passions. It's hard to recover that which gives me pleasure when I am in such new space, for example, waiting tables at Leona's and working for Mysterious Mystery Shopping. When&nbsp; you work a 12 hour day, the thought of watching a movie curled up on the couch with a beer and a cigarette trumps the idea of reading ANYTHING. I'm scared.  Please, someone, convince me that there is an actual difference between John Kerry and George Bush...

      In corsets, like we do, year after year, day after day.  Oh to be alive. Feeling well, feeling in power. I know that indicates I'm thinking wrong about things, but until I can get my mind around the right way to go about picturing myself, at least I'm happy. I saw this movie yesterday called "the grass is always greener". Fantastic.  Also: I love it how the Economist and the Wall Street Journal can say the same thing about the economy, I mean recite the same facts, but convince you of opposite states of affairs at the same time. It really goes along with Donald Davidson's thesis about paradigms and evidence.  Melech Rachaman, Rachem Aleinu. Tov Umeitiv Hidaresh Lanu. Shuva Eleinu Bahamon Rachamecha.

      Looking forward to Germany like chemotherapy--you solve one problem at the expense of loosing your hair, intense vomiting, skin boils, etc.  Anyway, I'm still healthy, in case you were worried. Tsiona and Dani, thanks for calling last night. (PS. in America, we sleep at night, you know, from around 1-9 AM, ok?) I've finally come around to accept that this, well, IS my life. I'm not waiting for something exciting to happen, and I'm not expecting things to radically change. I'm just living it. I think that may mean I've given something up. What the hell. My parents and grandmother insist on driving me crazy. Very strange. I've decided that I need to give them as much as I can without expecting them to realize and without expecting any thanks (since nothing is enough).  And so it blows, tiddlibum.

      Lieszche and I went to see Princess Diaries 2 yesterday and ate $40 worth of coke and candies and shit, and got hyper-glycemic, and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It's early in the morning and it feels like winter is closing in all around, though it's far off. Something about the chill of these mornings is uncanny...

      I used to think I'd whore my poetic tapestry to the first taker.  Now I know it's not true. Rather: I now know I'd tax he nude in my bed. No, no, what's the word? Ah,  welcome . I would welcome the nude in my bed, if only it weren't...Thursday.  A poem from "Hymns for the Drowning" by Nammalvar:  Before I could say,    "He became cowherd        fish         wild boat," he became a million million.  or, perhaps, a favorite favorite? So which of us is drowning baby?  I had a rare encounter today with a dark and evil thought that rang truly true like a newly acquired familiarity, and now, I am on the rampage.  Furthermore: Alan Keys told the world today that Obama's position on abortion is akin to that of the slave traders--let the people decide, never mind what our moral commitments are. It's an oddly affable argument. I can't seem to stop smiling. If only there were no morality to the other side of things, the argument would actually shtim. As it stands, Keys looks a bit silly. Like the authors of the Talmud--"certainly it is our perogative to decide whose life is worth more, the mother or the baby. After all, we are MEN!"  But, as my Rebbe Miriam says, sarcasm is not an argument. So here's the argument: fuck off. Don't tell me you want to marry me and then leave me a $50 tip when I can't throw it back in  your face because of my credit card debt. Can't you see that the sight of you makes my knees shake, and bile rise in my throat?!? I hate you all.

      All the world like a woolen lover once did seem on Henry's side. Then came a departure. Thereafter nothing fell out as it might or ought. I don't see how Henry, pried  open for all the world to see, survived.  Vehamavin Yavin.   Almost back, almost home, or is it. Gay Israelis are the UberMenschen. You get all the burning suffering exciting and engaging conversation of an israeli without the trying to get laid mention the army as much as possible how can I force her into a place she casn't refuse bullshit. It's the perfect combination. They are, well, fabulous. (who would have thought this was the perfect combo waiting to happen.) I told the cook who catered the Sheva Brachot at our house that I am a waitress and he laughed in my face. He absolutely refused to believe me. He lives in Har Homa and called me "Ati" the way Arab speakers do when they never realize the difference. Funny that. Murad was the same way. I could never bring myself to point it out. I think I'll always be that way. These days bring it up as a joke, but it's more painful that way. When I say I bring it up I mean things that would have shamed me as a fifteen year old and I thus asume are still shameful to my interlocutors. It's like retarded people--get over yourself!!! But Israel is good. Zev, I'll be at Shushan 4 tonight again with Eliyahu and maybe Jose--come join us.
