      How Did You Know Chiqui Pineda   I remember so well The day that you came into my life You asked for my name You had the most beautiful smile    My life started to change I'd wake up each day feeling alright With you right by my side Makes me feel things will work out just fine   CHORUS How did you know I needed someone like you in my life That there's an empty space in my heart You came at the right time in my life  I'll never forget How you brought the sun to shine in my life And took all the worries and fears that I had I guess what I'm really trying to say It's not everyday that someone like you comes my way No words can express how much I love you

      it has really been a long time since i checked my blog..it's because lagi may assignment and busy sa school..meron lang isang teacher i can't say na terror siya pero and init talaga ng dugo sa amin..a month ago it was just the start of the school year but time is really going fast 1 month na pala akong nasa highschool department..sobrang saya taaga pero mahirap din talaga..by the way the NSSC Elections last friday was really successful I think all the new batch of officers are all deserving but some of them i'm still in doubt of their capacity to serve the students of NS but I dont want to name names no..congrats sa lahat ng winners..maybe it will be a long time before i visit my blog again..so to all of you thanks for reading my blog..mwaaahhhhh!!!

      it is quite a while since i  last posted something that's because i was just enjoying my first few days being a high school student..it's fun being in high school at the same time it's a bit hard..when i was browsing my books for this year i told myself "kaya ko kaya to?eh masyadong ccomplicated mga lessons?"then i thought that if i wil study really hard i will be a great student..i don't want to cram anymore during exams..ill not be lazy anymoore..next week we'll start regular clases already..ngayon we are just having fun habang di pa pahirapan..it's fun being in high school..but im still not that used to it..i was elected vice president in our class..haay naku big responsibility nanaman buti nga best friend ko naging president kasi mahirap maging president no..naku till here na lang..tc..

      this week was a great week for me..  MONDAY: It was a great start for a new week..Late in the afternnon all 1st year students had our PE..We had a lot of fun..kaya lang may physical test kami as in racing..talo ako pero at least may grade diba..but the worst part i had a hard time breathing after that..pero ruth took care of me kaya naging ok din ako..  TUESDAY: Computer class namin today kaya for sure masaya nanaman..We had our discussion it was all good..Orur filipino teacher gave us a very interesting activity for the next day which was gift giving..  WEDNESDAY: Exciting..Today is the day para ibigay mga gift namin for each other kaya lang nag-cry ako kasi i was very touched for my friend's effort and yung mga inakala ko na di magbibigay ng letter they gave me one kahit simple note lang..It was a great day for me..I saw ate alex in school with ABU of course her only love..haha..bka patayin ako ni ate alex..HHHHEEEELLLLLLPPPPPP!!!  THURSDAY: It is our BEC today and our group facilitated it..I sang how did you know in class, it was our opening song..muntik na ako umiyak for a certain reason mga friendships ko alam yun..many things has changed since the gift giving..some was good but other experiences of mine were traumatic..hehe..in short it was really sad for me and even though the truth hurts, i still have to accept it..huhu..cry..   FRIDAY: i have already recovered for what happened for the past few days.today is the last day of the school days this week..im pretty excited for the weekend..I had a little chat with my friends..pero sayang i wasn,t able to see carissa and louise joy..pero this week was great..even though may part na maskit talaga..
