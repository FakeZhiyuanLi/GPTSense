      Well I can't say that I'm upset right now with the way things are going.  M and I are talking all the time, and I can't get her out of my head.  She loves me :D  I love her too.  Now my only issue is the time...  I'm still afraid that two years would be way too long of a time right now, and then, even if we made it, it'd be another 2 and a half again before anything could REALLY happen.  N is still an issue, because she e-mails me constantly, and I stil care for her, but in the end, M will be mine.  I don't know what to do about N though.  I keep thinking about my life, and the person that I am.  I want to change stuff.  It's time that I clean up, and I plan to actually do it and stick to it this time.  For the first time in a long time, I'm happy with my life.

      God women in this world should all just be shot...  Why is it so impossible to get one to listen to you?  When will them madness stop?  It seems like everything a man does during a fight only makes things worse!  I can't wait for N to get back from Wyoming...  I need to talk to her though.  Things aren't going exactly the way I wanted them to.  Wish I could go back and change it all...

      God, it seems like no matter how hard I try there's nothing right in this world for me to hang on to...  Everything is so fubar.  What I wouldn't give to just go back to Italy!  Everything here in the states is so...  Arrogant and so brisque!  I suppose it doesn't really help that I'm in the middle of nowhere, but still.  The people of Napoli were better.  And they didn't give me the troubles that women here do.  No matter what, I can't seem to decide.  M, with her amazing beauty and sweet innocence, as opposed to N, with her attractive playfullness and OBVIOUS willingness, or B who I could have for as long as I wanted to be there, with a hug and with support, and to love me, but with intimacy extending only as far a kiss at the end of a date...  How do I decide what's more important?  Voglio tornarmi a Italia...
