      I was watching Spider Man 2 in the cinema hall yesterday... When a fine thought pierced my head... It started to tear me apart from the core of my head... And it continued to haunt me through the rest of the night....What was this reckless emotion that started to melt me... &nbsp; I just realized gazing up onto the Big Screen of the Cinema Hall with the monsterous sounds blaring at me...That it's been an year now since ...someone told me .... ... Since some one gave me a ... since&nbsp;there's been any emotions .... I felt weird at that very instant... Weird in a pathetic kind of way... What was I asking for here?&nbsp;What did I lose&nbsp;? What have I gained?&nbsp;&nbsp;

      In order to let the mind unfurl and unravel into the meandering unknown of the everlasting universe of eternity. Out human senses need to be expanded within it's present confines and limitations together with the binding walls of conformity we shall never get to the higher strata. &nbsp; Our neural cortex is under stimulated at it should be jerked around more often to truly understand our true potential. More than ever we realize how much possibility lies ahead of us... Haven't you felt that time slows down to accomodate a Million actions right before you hit the floor when you're on a Motorbike cruising along and headed for that vital fall. In those few&nbsp;seconds that&nbsp;just precede the actual happening Time slows down for&nbsp;you to accomadate an eternity of spinal synapsis. Couldn't we integrate that moment to fill a larger&nbsp;confine. To let it fill&nbsp;the shape and size of the container in which we store our life.&nbsp; &nbsp; Would we need enhanced sensory organs to encapuslate those experiences over larger periods of time ... Can we premeditate a Deja vu experience? Or summon a dej vu at random instances in waking time. Would it be detrimental to our environment? Would we be dealing with control domain of time as we bend it and enter another dimension.

      Bah... I'm rambling... mumbling.. cussing... incoherent...the horror.. the horror..  So here i am ... hollering out from the depths of my aching heart .. the dungeons have opened the spirit that soars and sweeps thru the pungent stinking corridors of the pits of eteternal void that once was or perhaps never truly evolved just mutated into this self loathing animosity ...  the sheer pain of an infinite wasp stings... or if pain could be channelled into the core of the earths... if 6 billion labor pains were channeled to the core of the earth would it erupt... what if we included all the animals and birds and reptiles and all the creatures that are born and die.. If we could extract the pain the feel in their life and pour into the darkest deepest black hole ever to be ...would it maintain an equilibrium.. would all the negativity  and bad karma that has created a void be filled with good karma... or would a lingering cancerous growth emerge from a tiny speck of pain that was left behind...  This kettle of molten anguish is in which we're dipped and our skirmishes and blemishes are embedded with shrieking hollering inferno of pain ... Is it vailable for any of us to spend an eternity in this molten lava marsh pit of pain...  amazing how the human mind comprehends feelings unlike no other beast ..

      16 years on the planet ; 8 of which i was technically away from home. But never in those years had i missed being at home as I did yesterday. I'm a late bloomer. In a fit of rage my first instinct is flight and then fight. I run away from the predicament; then there's a voice in my head that calls me a chicken... and to calm that deafening yell I run back... sometimes it's too late.. I return with hopes of having gained some momentum in the process... But it's the sheer spontaentity that was lost...   Am I whining? Probably... Abt what...well a lot of things... Primarily July 13th 2004 just slipped by ...  On this planet with 6 billion ppl the only sibling I have was born 16 years ago... Jeddah Medical Center... born premature... the year was 1988... Hey! The euphoria dies down over the years ..But I guess it's when the geographic dispostion kicks in that we realize how much somebody means to you... the sheer beauty of an anniversary is the periodicity of celebration .. as humans we look forward to timely reasons to steer away from the dull drab boring mundane daily existance.. human intimacy finds reason to elate in sporadic eruptions of the unknown celebratary joy ...   I must have been there as a lingering spirit .... the things we say and do to appease the lingering spirit within...  ------------------------------------------- C.S.I. - Crime Scene Investigation; [2.06 - ALTER BOYS]  William L. Petersen as Gil Grissom Dylan Baker as Father Powell  Powell: "You still suffer like a Catholic. Light bulb goes out, other people fix it, get a new one. Light bulb goes out for the Catholic, he stands in the dark and says 'what did I do wrong?'" Grissom: "That guilt's not in me anymore."  --------------------------------------------  Unfortunately I guess there remains the lingering guilt within..   "Guiltabbal Lecter" is having me with fava beans and a nice chianti... and amidst all the strifes and scourging I go thru ..   He has come thru to say, "Hello Ajnu Clare...I'd assume you're having a jolly good time amidst all those faggots in the middle of that semi inhabitted forest. Poor lil' thing... First principles, Miss Ajnu Clare. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing ask: what is it in itself? What is its nature? What do they do, these people around you what do they seek? "   And then he retreats with his " I do wish we could chat longer, but I'm having an old friend for dinner. Bye."  Ofcourse he has to return to his domicile within me and eat me away.. And in that brief instant that I managed to sneak away from his lurking presence... I whimper... "Happy Birthday Ajnu!"

      Very few people realise that each and every word we have said, do say and will say, deeply influences the way in which we each experience the world. Moreover, every word that each of us has already heard, is hearing or will hear - affects us profoundly.  And as i sat around thinking, pondering, remembering the people that filled my life. I found myself giggling away to myself. Surely it would look like I have hit the high grounds of insanity for any onlooker, but it was nothing but a recollection of the words that people made up. No dictionary would have'em listed, and as the grey matter withers away the tethering shreds of memory too wouldn't rummage upon it. The compulsion to have them documented seemed to splurge from within.  If the project at hand comes anywhere close to completion I would truly treasure it as the most valid of my earthly possessions... The last verses that I would like to be read to me on my death bed. When my eyes would have failed me and my ears can hardly comprehend the incoherent garble and sounds that echo through the air.   If any one who has known me in this earthly lifetime of mine, would be kind enough to recite the liturgy of words on my death bed. You can rest assured that you have sent this wretched soul to the land of eternal bliss and happiness.

      I have finally managed to acquire a speck on the virtual microcosm. I have come of age to profess the ludicrous ruminating that my mind goes through. Years of incoherent thought have withered away. But here in I leave behind Hieroglpyhs for Vagabonds and Knights alike.  What do I intend to acquire out of this escapade; I haven't figured out as of yet. Maybe the verbal diarrhea may release a variant of oxytocin into my system. Or maybe it's agorophobia getting the better of me. How and where does one get from here?   Along the way I read it's never 'Why me?' rather 'Why not me?' To be kicked in the nuts over and again is what life the bitch does best... And the abhorrent, arrogant, egoist that I am I learn things my way.

      How weird is it for people to have a ten(that's just a number) faces ... I mean how on earth and how fake and stupid is it that we have to continually keep selling ourself as something we are not ... Is it worth the hassle we go through... do we lose track of who we are ...in this chaotic commotion ...is it like do we all get a chance to be John Malkovich... and when we eventually turn into Malkovich do we forget ourselves completely does it reach a point of no return where we turn into a shallow pitiable Gollum of our previous selves... Is that what greed and selfish vanity does to each of us?  Look around you ...you find mutated freaks ... Freaks who don't remember who they are where they came from where they are headed to why they turned into this vulgar grotesque human form... Indeed a matter worth pondering over... How much of pain should be inflicted upon each of us to be tempered into that perfect human ... Is the die we are all cast in so different that some of us are scouraged over and over again to bemuse some the creator... Is this hand picked society that we have been made to dwell in .. the people we have been asked to work with live with ..upto his discretion... Then why does he show the tip the tip of the iceberg and take it all away from you.. Is this life a compilation of trailers and teaser trailers previews and glimpses into a time that will be.. or a hallucigin induced present is the only way we can experience it....

      Yes ... I've come to realize that any wish made fortha true desire and a noble cuase shall be answered ....For there lies no Bad Karma to bring upon the demise of a true wish... It was an awakening of the inner self.. undescribable...if youve'nt witnessed it on your own... Barricades open themselves and let tehe flood gates barge in to bury away...  Life gives you another chance to get back at the stuff you want to .. if u hang around with the will long enough.. It kinda tends to show you that amidst all the storms that it can brew up if u persevere...  Honestly it's been a while since some kinda inner tranquility has been restored... atleast temporarily.. It felt good... and it's been so long since that has happened...

      Strange isn't it ... the way people behave ...over time how we change... for better or for worse.. how indecisive we are ... It's intriguing... Life has taken it's rollercoaster ride yet again.. and I'm reigning in the pure uncertain premise of my life... I find the simplest of tasks at hand admonishing at times. Nonetheless I've had enough of the "Why hath Thou forsaken me?" attitude... I've been walking away for way too long.. I'm surrounded my nothingness in terms of people and realtionships... I could truly exhault my self to the status of being the loneliest person on the planet... But then again it's in that solitary confinement that I feel content. So am I Rubin Carter waiting to turn into a Papillion ....  I'm a wretched soul tormented by the slightest pertext ...wilting wimpering wondering... if there shall ever be a Phoenix to come about from this... to exorcize the demons within...
