      Well I spent time with some of my many friends.&nbsp; The people I hang out with most are Richard, Matt, and Zach.&nbsp; Well they were over today, so we decided to go to the mall.  I LOVE music video games.&nbsp; And I had been looking for a PS2 game called "Rez" for awhile.&nbsp; Well, I found it today.&nbsp; I found Rez at the mall media store called FYE.&nbsp; It was $31.99 but it was well worth it, since it's an awesome and very rare game.  I also purchased a CD at FYE.&nbsp; It's "The Best of, The Church".&nbsp; I love the band, The Church, and this CD is great.&nbsp; It has 17 songs on it, and I love all of them.  After the mall, we all came back to my house and played video games/watched funny things on the internet/listened to music.&nbsp; I love spending time with my friends.

      I decided to make my own blog today.&nbsp; I might have fun with it, editing the the template and all to the best of my abilities. (I don't know much HTML)&nbsp;   Yeah, yesterday was my birthday.&nbsp; I turned 16.&nbsp; I don't have a car, I'll be getting my license soon, though.&nbsp; I went to Benihana's to eat.&nbsp; It's a japanese restaurant where they prepare the food right in front of you with these cooking tables.&nbsp; The food was really good, especially the fried rice.&nbsp;    A list of everything I got from friends and family:   - Kodak EasyShareCX7300 digital camera -Computer/desk chair -The Bourne Identity DVD -Hot Shots DVD -Naked Gun DVD -$60 -$22 -$20 gift card to the local media store (FYE) -A cut rock, it's really beautiful.&nbsp; Came with a stand. -Two "hoodies".&nbsp; I love "hoodies".   With the money I had I purchased:  -The Matrix: Revolutions DVD -Sealab 2021: Season 1 DVD -Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Volume 2 DVD -Snowboard Kids (video game) -Gun Valkyrie (video game) -Mad Maestro (video game)  That's about it for my birthday, oh yeah there was a good cake.&nbsp; It's half yellow cake and half chocolate cake.&nbsp; It's covered with vanilla icing, and there are some balloons.&nbsp; It's really good.  Wow I just realized how dull this must be for people.&nbsp; Well I thank anyone who takes time to read this stuff.
