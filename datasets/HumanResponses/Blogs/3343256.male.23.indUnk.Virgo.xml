       At this time, we are not able to identify a match for you.  We require that any match we provide be highly compatible with your values, beliefs and attitudes. This standard means that thousands of eHarmony users are often not matched right away.    We are optimistic that we'll find the right matches for you and hope you will remain optimistic too. We don't intend to lower our standards and you shouldn't either. We ask for your patience during this process and assure you that the right match will be worth the wait.   Translation: We're sorry, but there is no one compatible with you, even with the search area set on "The Entire World".    Ouch.

       urlLink GuruNet  is an interesting little program I've found for those, like me, that sometimes look at a word and go "huh"?  All you do, is load this little program onto your computer, then you hold alt, click a word you don't understand, then release alt.   Then the program pops up and gives you a definition.  It's very nice, and very useful.  Hope its useful to someone out there.

      ...its because I don't understand it well enough myself.  So, if you read anything, and go "huh"? Be sure to leave a comment on what you don't get.  That will help me focus on what to learn more to make clearer.  I'm looking more for concepts that I either seem to take for granted, or anything else that I haven't explained clearly, rather than words you are simply unfamiliar with.    Thanks, this will help me lots. :)

      How to review a book of such a powerful message in such a short space, I have no idea.  This book is one I would recommend to anyone who is serious about doing something with their life.  It provides the tools necessary for a person to get past the issues that hold the vast majority of us back from reaching our potential.  The prime power of this book is its ability to create a paradigm shift in your way of thinking.  For those who aren't familiar with that term, here is how the dictionary defines it:  A set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality for the community that shares them, especially in an intellectual discipline.   We are all brought up with a certain way of looking at the world, of there being certain truths to things.  This book helps people to shift their paradigm of the world to be able to see situations and problems in a whole new light.  This paradigm shift if the whole basis, in my opinion, behind this book's power. A quote from Einstein in the book reads:  The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.   The way we view the world significantly impacts our ability to affect the world.  Very briefly I will try to run through the 7 steps listed in the book.  1.  Be Proactive : It sounds almost cliche to tell people to be proactive, but it's an important basis to begin at.  Many people let others control their lives, either through expectations, or hatred of other people determining your actions, or simply doing something you've always done just because that's the way you've always done it.  In short it means being responsible for your life.  Which simply means being able to choose how to respond to situations instead of just reacting in a pre-programmed way.  2.   Begin with the end in mind :  Why do you do what you do?  What drives you? What do you want to accomplish, what do you want to be remembered for?  What makes you different from everyone else around you?  Whereas the first habit tells you that you  can  have control over how you act, the second habit tells you where to direct that control.  Or more accurately, it gives you the tools to let you determine the direction.  3.  Put first things first :  This habit is basically the time management chapter.  But not in the traditional sense of scheduling everything out.  Rather it teaches you to do those things that are important yet not urgent.  Think of it as preventive maintenance.  It helps to remove the constant panic of crisis management, and gives time to build relationships and plan your vision for your life.  With this habit you put the first two habits into action.  Together these 3 habits work to make you an independent person, able to determine your own future.  4.   Think Win/Win :  This habit is the first of those for dealing with other people.  It's a strong message to give, and one that I personally fully agree with.  The message is to, in every situation, see a path that is mutually beneficial for all of those involved.  Instead of just looking out for yourself, look for what is good for everyone, because you never deal with a person just once.  If you question the validity of this habit, just consider for a moment how you feel towards someone who wants you to do something and that you feel has no interest in your own well being.  5.   Seek first to understand, then to be understood : This is the chapter on  urlLink Empathy  that I wrote about earlier.  I can't really add much to what I said in that post, other than that if you want to get the most out of all your relationships, learn to look through the other person's eyes first.  Once you do that, they will then be willing to look at the situation through your eyes.  6.   Synergize :  A fancy word that simply means that the whole is greater than the sum of two parts.  This habit is strongly related to the previous two.  By looking for a mutually beneficial solution, and understanding the other's point of view, you can accomplish so much more together than simply adding together what you could do separately.  7.   Sharpen the saw :  This habit is about taking the time to step back, and keep yourself healthy and on track.  With this habit you learn to take the time to take care of your needs so that you can more successfully perform the other habits to their highest perfection.  With this habit you renew your ability to go on.  Well, that was rather long, but hopefully it will inspire some of you out there to pick this book up.  If you are serious about personal growth and maturity in your life, I promise you won't be disappointed.  Oh, and you can click the a link at the right to get it from Amazon and help me out in the process. ;)

      Are individuals, and developed countries in general, over insured?  Everything from cars, to jobs, to health, so interest rate changes and currency flutuations seems to be insured these days.  Now, don't get me wrong, insurance is a nice thing to have.  Most people can't afford to dish out tens of thousands of dollars if their car is smashed, or if they need major surgery.  But in those cases the insurance works in such a way that small payments over time balance out the large bills that happen rarely.  It's like paying on a loan before you need it, and perhaps never needing it, yet at the same time being able to draw on it multiple times.  That's classic insurance, and its designed to handle big problems.  What is appear more and more however is full insurance, that is designed to cover all the little problems that pop up.  That is where the problem lies.  As every little problem problem surfaces, the insurance takes it away, and no behavior is changed.  Normally when something bad happens, say getting a ding on their car, the people pay for the repair if they can afford it, and want it, and if they don't, they don't.  With 'full' insurance that ding is repaired whether it's really necessary or not.  This analogy can be extended to most about anything.  People no longer exert any personal control on their spending, because it is not  their  money that is paying for it.  At least, that's what they think.  In the end, the money that is payed into an insurance plan has to at least match what is paid out (plus overhead and profits) in order for an insurance company to stay in business.  This relates directly to my  urlLink previous  post.  There are things called derivatives in the financial world.  What they are generally used for is to blunt the impact of price changes through-out the economy.  Including exchange rates.  Many economists recently have remarked that changes in the dollar's value is having a reduced effect from what is normally expected, due to the fact that so many companies have used these derivatives to insure against changes.  As a result they are not reacting to changes in the economy as they should be, as they are too well insulated to notice.  Health insurance is another big area where over insurance is taking its toll.  With no incentive to pay attention to where a person's money is going, people are more likely to spend it unwisely.  Purchasing prescriptions that they may not need because the doctor is being pressured to push them.  Getting unneccesary procedures done, because the cheaper plan is not covered under the HMO's plan.  Overall health is allowed to deteriorate because if someone gets sick, they can just go to the doctor, no worries.  As a result, health costs continue to surge year after year.  All in all, I think insurance is starting to get out of hand, and we are starting to pay the price for it.  Side note:  urlLink HSAs  are now available to help blunt the cost of medical care, while still letting the individual control what is going on.

       urlLink Previously  I discussed the U.S. current account deficit and how it related to the federal deficit.  In that post I stated that the federal deficit is simply a reflection of the current account deficit shift from private into public hands.  This rationally makes sense, due to the fact that much of the deficit was created by tax cuts.  Those tax cuts allowed the public to increase or maintain their current purchases (there by maintaining the current account deficit) while the government footed the bill.  This spells bad news for the economy in my opinion.  The existance of a large current account deficit means that we are buying more than we are selling, in regards to the rest of the world.  This cannot continue indefinatly.  It is an indication that the economy is not sufficiently producing products domestically to match the demand for such products.  As such we are purchasing those products from abroad.  Now, that does not mean we should not purchase those foreign products.  Thanks to the market, we can simply make products that are more valuable to the rest of the world to reduce the deficit.  How can we do that?  Normally the market will do that on its own, provided it isn't fiddled with in the mean time.  So who has been fiddling with it?  Answer: Everyone.  Japan and China, along with most other East Asian currencies manipulate the exchange rates to keep their currencies, and therefore their products, cheap.  With those currencies cheaper than the market would set it is artificially making their products more desireable than the U.S.'s.  Now, there are other factors, including maintaining stability in China, on why those countries are manipulating their exchange rates.  I am attempting here to simply analyze, not place blame.  Additionally, the Bush Administration's tax cuts have fiddled with the economy.  Around the beginning of the decade the economy was slowing as, I believe, it was attempting to correct the current account deficit.  I like to call this a purification cycle, others call it a recession.  At this time the tax cuts were being pushed through, and many people were remarking on the excellent timing of it to avert the recession.  And indeed, it worked.  The recent recession is remarked as being one of the mildest in history.  However, at what cost?  Already it is visible that the recovery was slow in coming.  That however may be attributable to other circumstances, such as the enhanced gains in productivity.   What about the future though?  We still have a large (5% of GDP or so) current account deficit that the market will keep trying to correct.  One way to correct is for the exchange rates to adjust, with the dollar falling.  However the dollar needs something to fall against.  East Asia won't let their's fall.  Europe is simply unattractive, and with the potential of interest rate reductions, will become more so.    The other, more likely option is for the previous solution to be attempted by the market again: purification cycle.

      Thats what I need.  Four, and just four hours a day.    Why? Because that is, I've discovered, about how long during each day at work my mind is able to come up with and process new ideas and theories.  So thats what I need.  A job that doesn't require me to think, and lets me just do repetitive mindless tasks for 4 hours.  Then I can come home, sleep on the ideas, and then write about them.    Which is what I'm doing right now.

      Yesterday, while reading  urlLink The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People  I was deeply moved by the chapter on the 5th Habit: Empathy.  The core principle that the author was trying to convey was:  Seek first to understand, then to be understood.   What that means is empathy is not sympathy, where you relate your own experiences or understanding to what someone else is going through.  Rather empathy is taking the time to see and understand what is going on from the other person's point of view.  I was moved by this because it struck me with such force that  this  is what I was missing growing up.  I never considered my childhood happy.  Oh, it was better than many, I know that.  There was no abuse, plenty of food, two parents.  But there was always something missing that I couldn't quite put my finger on, and that no one would listen when I tried to express it.  That something was empathy.  No one understood me.  It wasn't until about a year ago, when I discovered my INTP nature, that I even made the connection that I wasn't being understood.  I had just accepted the fact that I was wrong, and I should be happy.  But I never was, and never felt that close to anyone in my family.  Reading the sample conversations in the book I felt like I was going back in time, to the point that it actually brought tears to my eyes.  Trying to explain what was wrong, and the people I was talking to trying to fix the problems without really taking the time to listen to what was  really  wrong.  Even today I get that when I talk with people about what I'm going to do for a job or career, and someone just says "Go to college!" as if that will solve all my problems.  I've actually felt offended when someone says that to me, and now I know its because they didn't really take the time to understand.  They just wanted to fix the problem from their perspective, from what they would do, or think  they  should have done.  What I am really looking for is someone to take the time to understand what  I  want.  Now, obviously thats a pretty big want.  Most people don't care at all about another person's problems.  I guess I am fortunate at that, to an extent, I do take the time to care.  I even made two friends that way, by sitting there and listening to them talk about the problems in their marriage.  Oh, I wasn't, and am not, the perfect empathizer, I know that.  However I found it rather amusing that one of the suggestions for action at the end of the chapter was to catch yourself when you arn't listening anymore, and are trying to judge the situation by your own autobiographical stance.  It was amusing because I recall many, many times when I would try to offer a solution to a friend, and realize that I wasn't listening, and actually say "Oops, trying to fix the problem, shutting up, continue".  So, keep this in mind people.  If you really want to have a good relationship with someone, learn empathy.  Understand what is going on from their point of view, don't try to relate it to your own experiences.  Take the time to actually care.  They will appreciate it, and so will I.

      Browsing through  urlLink U.S. trade data  I've discovered the primary driver of the current account deficit.  Oil, cars, and electronics.  Oil products and vehicles alone make up approximatly 1/5 of the total increase in the size of the U.S. current account deficit from 1998 to 2003.    Where is the rest coming from? No where specifically.  All across the board imports are up, while exports are mostly steady.  The result? An ever widening deficit.  We are essentially borrowing to drive.  An important note to remember though.  This is the U.S. current account deficit, not the U.S. governments fiscal deficit.  The difference is that the current account deficit reflects the total of both public and private debt.  Additionally, the current account deficit grew the most between 1998 and 2000, almost doubling in fact, while the government's fiscal deficit was actually a surplus by the end.  Interestingly, the current account deficit grew by only about 1/4 between 2000 and 2003, while the government's fiscal deficit grew massivly.  In 2003 alone the federal deficit was $374B while the current account deficit was $535B.  What does that mean?  It means that although the size of the current account deficit has continued to grow, the source of its growth has changed from private to public hands.    Which begs the question, should the government seek to reduce its burden, and if so, what will happen?  I will attempt to address that question in a later post.   Update:  I've recently recalled that Bush has ordered the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be completely filled.  That most likely is a prime cause of oil's substantial increase in imports.

      Ok, Missa just dropped me a note saying she couldn't leave comments here for some reason.  I went into the settings, and re-saved it as "Anyone can Comment".  I even did a test by logging out.  Seems to work now.  If you wanna have your name appear, instead of it being from Anonymous, then feel free to register.  So far I have received exactly 0 e-mail from Blogger.  So I think its pretty safe regarding spam.  Happy commenting people.  And let me know again if it still doesn't work.

      I've been reading a lot of books lately, and keep either getting hung up, or bogged down with the reading.  In other words its not going as fast as I'd like, so I'm looking for ways to improve my reading performance.  I'm currently looking at two books, and am wondering which to get.  Or even both.  They are:   urlLink Breakthrough Rapid Reading   and   urlLink Power Reading : The Best, Fastest, Easiest, Most Effective Course on Speedreading and Comprehension Ever Developed!   Both have very good reviews.  Just reading the reviews I think I'd get the first one.  Any suggestions or alternate recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

      Ugh, I'm certainly understanding right now what all those personality type pages are talking about when they say that working with less developed functions is stressful for people.  First some background:  The four letters in the personality types translate into four functions that describe how our minds work.  The first and last letter describe the details of the middle two letters.  I'll explain the exact details later, but for an INTP that means that Ti (introverted Thinking) and Ne (extroverted iNtuition) are the dominant and auxillary traits.  There are how we interact with the world the most.  Right now I'm working on a program design to simulate how an economy works.  And that is forcing me to use my Si (introverted Sensing) function to flesh out all the details to make sure it operates correctly (Sensing means details, iNtuition means big picture).  So while I can invision how the integrated whole is supposed to look, my brain is getting fried working out the details of the implemention.  And its giving me a headache.  Incidently I think that the stress works both ways.  Working in lower functions causes stress, and stress can cause you to work in lower function.  A deadly cycle.

      Exactly how similar are the cultures of Europe and America?  Many people seem to shove us all together into one big entity called "Western Society".  The Aussies are shoved into that conglomeration as well.  But is it true?  Are we really as similar as many people think.  Sure, when compared with the rest of the world, we are very similar.  As is expected, considering the fact Europe was the launching ground for the building of the Americas and Australia.  But even with those similarities there are so many differences that people seem to overlook.  Certainly recent events can attest to the differing views on how to handle global issues.  Local issues seem to me to be an even greater source of differences.  Social welfare is one particularly large example.  European cultures, along with Canada, place a higher premium on such spending, to the extent that they seem to believe Americans don't care about each other at all.  Which any American would respond that that couldn't be farther from the truth, we simply have different ways to doing things, such as chartiable giving.  Even within America and Europe there are vast differences.  This post today was inspired by an article in the Wall Street Journal about an EU-Swiss banking deal.  The Swiss rejected the more sweeping tax-evasion rules that the EU wanted, saying:   "Privacy is one of our core values...We like to trust the citizen instead of assuming he's a cheat."  A book I am reading,  urlLink The Wealth and Poverty of Nations , has helped me understand some of the unique characteristics of 'Western' society that helped it grow into the world power that it is today.  Hopefully light will be shed, as I continue reading, on the differences within the cultures as well.   Such an understanding that we are in fact seperate and distinct cultures I suspect would help to at least calm some of the tensions and misunderstandings among us.  Along the divide of right and left cultures, the left seems to look down on others as having unacceptable values, while the right parodies left's hipocracy saying "We believe everyone has the right to live in their own way, as long as it agrees with our view of what that way should be."  Perhaps if more people understood that we are all different cultures, there would be less hate among us 'allies'.  A vain hope I suspect.

      Note to self: Making a draft article will cause the article to be posted under the date that it was first saved, not the date it was posted. (See health care article at bottom).  Note to readers: Missa confirmed that she blushed. :P  General notes:   I have a site counter now....so I KNOW if you don't come back!  Learning how to blog is rather interesting, as I am getting lessons in HTML as well.  Largely due to the fact that you simply can't click a button to add a feature.  You have to go into the source code on the page to edit stuff in there.  A little more work and I can change those nasty colors that are the blogroll default.  That is all, carry on.

      Yes, you heard me.  I cut my own hair. I'm cheap.  And, it means I don't have to deal with people who seem to have an obsessive-compulsive need to talk.  You know...hair dressers, or barbers, or whatever they wanna call themselves.  The right side of my head is a lil more jagged than the left though.  I think I need to clear it up tomorrow morning after I take a shower...that should do it.  Hopefully I can aim good so it all lands in the garbage without me having to vacuum again.  I probably should have taken my dad's advice to cut every week, so if I screw up, no one can notice.  But....I'm too lazy to cut my hair more than once a month.  Ah well. :P

      What excellent timing.  Browsing The Economist website and I find this  urlLink article .  A good sign for my first day with a blog.  Turns out birds, ravens at least, have what is called the "theory of mind" which basically means that they have an understanding that other creatures have minds of their own.  Here's a bit from the article demonstrating a bird's intelligence and awareness:   Dr Bugnyar...noticed strange interactions between two males, Hugin, a subordinate bird, and Munin, a dominant one.   The task was to work out which colour-coded film containers held some bits of cheese, then prise the containers open and eat the contents. The subordinate male was far better at this task than the dominant. However, he never managed to gulp down more than a few pieces of the reward before the dominant raven, Munin, was hustling him on his way. Clearly (and not unexpectedly) ravens are able to learn about food sources from one another. They are also able to bully each other to gain access to that food.   But then something unexpected happened. Hugin, the subordinate, tried a new strategy. As soon as Munin bullied him, he headed over to a set of empty containers, prised the lids off them enthusiastically, and pretended to eat. Munin followed, whereupon Hugin returned to the loaded containers and ate his fill.   At first Dr Bugnyar could not believe what he was seeing...Hugin, he is convinced, was clearly misleading Munin.   As it happened, Munin was no dummy either. He soon grew wise to the tactic, and would not be led astray. He even stooped to trying to find the food rewards on his own! This made Hugin furious. “He got very angry”, says Dr Bugnyar, “and started throwing things around.” Perhaps ravens have something else in common with people—a hatred of being found out.   Hmm, yeah, I get upset when my attempts at fooling someone go off track too. :P

      Read about this the other day in the Wall Street Journal.  Found it online  urlLink here .   Mr. Kerry, for his part, has a sweeping plan that tries to cover all uninsured children and most uninsured adults without the kind of fundamental structural change that doomed past Democratic proposals. It would cost $650 billion over 10 years, his campaign estimates, and would be financed by rolling back the Bush tax cuts for those earning over $200,000 a year.  The most unusual part of Mr. Kerry's plan would have the federal government pick up 75 percent of the cost of the most expensive medical cases - those of over $50,000 a year - if employers guaranteed that they would pass the savings along to their workers through reduction of premiums. This is intended to ease the burden on businesses, especially small ones, and provide cost relief to Americans with insurance.  I'd say this is a good start.  I've considered an idea similar to this for a while, where an ultra high government funded deductable was in place.  This plan has several good points.    One, its  a  plan.  And not a huge massive government controls everything plan.  Something like this would remove the need for such a centralized system that many people, myself included, believe could only cause spending to spiral ever more out of control.  Second, it will indirectly encourage the general trend towards moving people onto private health care.  With the government catching so much of the tab above a certain level, the "cherry-picking" problem some people cite will be largely eliminated, or at least severely reduced.  I have little problem with this being government funded, due to the fact that I see the government as something that should only do something either when a) Certain programs are not forced on those people who do not want them, or b) The indirect effects of such programs creates such side advantages to outweigh the drawbacks of less economic freedom.  All in all, its a good start to the health care debate.

      I love mind puzzles.  They are a great mental workout.  Fortunately, I've found a blog that have a new one (or more) up every day.  It's called  urlLink think again! .  Check it out if you like that sort of stuff.  Also, I ran across this animated puzzle game called  urlLink Chasm .  You are some sort of creature, that must fix the town's water supply, which has mysteriously broken.  Through a bunch of flood gates that you discover you can manipulate the flow of water to get it to flow where you need it to.  Took me perhaps an hour total.  Probably less.  A fun diversion in any case.  Enjoy.

      Ok, this is a bit late, as it happened a couple months ago.  But, basically the biggest stop for our bakery was a grocery store just down the street.  They had been slumping in sales, every year worse than the last, for about the last 5 years.   Why?  Because the super big grocery stores kept popping up.  It severely cut into this store's business, as they were more service oriented, and so higher prices.  Our products were more high end kind of stuff, so we fit in nicely there.  Lots of rich old folks who don't like the horribly soft bread, or rock hard cookies.  But, our sales there finally slumped enough that the owner kicked us out in favor of his own product, which he got through his store affiliation (Spartan stores).  Of course, his cookies tasted like crap, and I never even tried his bread.  I used to do my shopping there, but don't any longer.  See the post  urlLink below .  So, big stores brought about by globalism cost me my job.  But, as in my post below, I am not upset.  Especially as I did not particularly like my job anyway.  I've also already figured out a likely  urlLink alternative  for work.  In any case, I still got one month left before I am laid off.  Then it's free time galore!  And no money...but lots of free time galore!

      It's so useful at making things cheap.  Just yesterday I went to  Meijer  and bought a 12pk of bar soap.  For less than $6.  I don't remember exactly how much I was paying at the old grocery store I went to, but I'm pretty sure it was more than 50 cents a bar.  Which is actually a big deal, as I need to save all the money I can, due to the fact that I am soon to be unemployed.  Right now my grocery budget is about 20% of my expenses.  Definitely room for improvement.  Globalism is also nice in bringing down the prices of just about anything.  I love it.  Then again, maybe I'm thinking of free markets?  Free market globalism...hmm, yes, that works.  So, some people can whine all they want about it, but as far as I am concerned, it's a plus, despite the fact that it cost me my job.  Oh, wait, I never wrote about that, did I?   Hmm.

      I just  urlLink stumbled  across this rather amusing  urlLink short movie .  It's a combination of Star Wars and Office Space.  If you are familiar with both, likely this movie will at least get a chuckle out of you.  Especially when you see which Star Wars character plays the 'stapler guy.' You know, the one that mumbles, obsesses about his stapler, and was moved to the basement, with his paychecks finally cut off.  Yeah, that guy.  So, check it out.  P.S. The movie is long, over 4 minutes, so those without high speed internet, you were warned.

      Just talking to one of my friends today, the self appointed editor, and she is totally distraught.  She is turning into a girl.  Pink purse, with polka dot lining.  And she bought it herself!  Disgusting, isn't it?  Another friend wrote this:   You know you're in deep trouble when...  ...all the sappy songs on the radio seem good and true. OMG. :O  This, from someone that hates the concept of sappy!  What is it with girls?  I mean, some of them are always girly, but others are all tough like usually, including both of these friends.  So, why do they turn girly?  Not that I mind of course, I find occasional girliness rather attractive.  Note the occasional part though.  All the time, and it's generally a sign of witlessness.  Ah well, they are still two friends that I love, sappy girliness and all.  If either starts wearing froofy pink dresses though, I'd have to kill them.  For their own sakes, of course.   Update:  Example

      Was at my parents today, for our family's monthly dinner thingy.  After everyone left, I was in the office, and asked my dad if he ever used his scanner.  He said he didn't, and that it didn't even work right on his computer.  So I asked him if I could have it, and looked it up on eBay.  There were two, for $5 and $10, neither with any bids.  He just told me too take it.  Cool, eh?  I sure thought so.  Now...just gotta figure out what I can use it for.

      Yes, just one bee.  It lives in my back sliding door, between the main door/window and the storm door/window.  See, the storm door doesn't close all the way, so there is about a one centimeter opening that the bee can fly into.  It's using it's time making nests, for some reason.  I hope there isn't a queen around it is planning to invite in.    It has 3 nests so far.  Fortunately it seems to have abandoned the only one that is in the part that opens.  The other two are on the side that is permanently closed.  So, I am content to leave him.  He has a little spider friend next to his new nest.  Maybe they will kill each other.  I can hope at least.  Oh sweet! I just checked, and apparently he is cannibalizing the older two nests.  The one that I can access is almost completely destroyed already.  More observations on him later.

      Here are things I want in a job:  Flexible schedule. Using my mind. Enough to make ends meet. One on one interaction.  Things I don't want:  No idiot boss. No idiot co-workers. No jerks in general. No menial labor. No groupwork.  A lot to ask for, eh?  Well, I think I discovered the perfect job: Tutoring!  I can set my own schedule, will only work with people that want me to help them, will work one on one.  I could earn $10, $20, or even up to $50 an hour, although higher amounts are not likely anytime soon.  I can start out on college students.  There are plenty where I live, one university, and one community college.  Heck, half the town is college students.  What kind of tutor? Math of course.  Most people despise it because they don't understand it.  I do understand it.  I was told in high school that I was a good teacher when I helped my classmates understand how to do something.  I even taught a teacher once how to do his own assignment! (Granted, he was kinda stupid.)  Einstein said there are only two infinite things: the universe, and human stupidity.  He wasn't sure about the first, and the second is going to make me rich! :D

      Generally when we think of the environment and the economy, we think of two competing goals.  While usually true, it is not always that way, especially now.  First, let's look at some figures.  With gasoline making up  urlLink 45%  of all consumption of oil, and oil counting for about  urlLink 3.5%  of economic growth, that means over 1.5% of our economy each year is spent solely on purchasing gasoline.    Looking at the  urlLink environmental side  it doesn't get any prettier.  In 2002 the U.S. emitted almost 5.8 billion tons of CO2 (table 4).  Of that, gasoline consumption for transportation amounted to over 1.1 billion tons(table 9).  Unlike most other countries in the world, the U.S. spends the majority of its oil consumption on  urlLink transportation , largely due to the fact that it is less densely populated, and as such requires more fuel to get where one needs to go.  Moving on to trade, I wrote before that   oil seems to make up a disproportionately large part of our current account deficit.   urlLink One fifth  of our current account deficit in fact is due to oil imports.  As stated by The Economist  urlLink recently  the deficit seems to have a life of it's own, regardless of whether there is a government deficit or not:   The OECD economists point out that private saving tends to fall when public saving increases. Between 1992 and 2000, for example, the Clinton administration turned a worrying budget deficit into a handsome surplus. But this only helped to unleash a private investment boom. Public saving was offset by private dissaving, ensuring that the country's trade deficit continued to deteriorate. America's budget and trade deficits may be twins but one, it seems, can survive without the other.  While you  undoubtedly  found this very interesting, you are likely wondering what my point is.  My point, simply, is that contrary to what some think, there is something we can do.  Recent spikes in the price of gas, have  urlLink shown  the American consumer's willingness to change to more efficient vehicles.  Hybrid vehicles produced by auto makers are showing an increase as a result:   The Prius...is attracting U.S. consumers after regular-grade gasoline prices rose 39 percent on average this year, to $2.051 a gallon. General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. will start selling their first hybrid models this year, seven years after Toyota introduced the Prius.  With higher fuel prices people now have the will to demand more efficient vehicles.  Where there is a will, there is a way.  I propose that the U.S. begin instituting an increased gas tax, to be phased in over the next decade.  And that it do so very publicly.  An increase of, say, 1 cent per gallon per quarter year, would give a lasting, and growing incentive for consumers to demand more efficient vehicles.  Fuel efficiency on such vehicles is so much greater than what is in use today, that we may in fact be able to inspire such a shift that would have virtually no negative effects on the economy.  This would be due not only to the fact that consumers will consume less, but also that the higher prices will not be going to other governments that pump the oil, but rather to our own.  Even those cynical about the efficiency of government spending are unlikely to dispute the fact that the benefits are much greater with gas revenue in our own government's hands.  Looking roughly at some  urlLink fuel economy data  it is easy to see that the most efficient cars are roughly twice as efficient as the least efficient.  This means that, especially as the technology improves, it may be possible to double the overall efficiency of cars on the road.  Extrapolating that out to the previous observations, and we see that it will: free up 3/4 of a percent of GDP to be spent somewhere other than on gas, every year; reduce CO2 emissions by about 10% overall; and that it will shrink the current account deficit by about 10% as well.  All are pretty major improvements, with the exception of the deficit, yet even that is a major plus as any decrease in it right now is something that is definately favorable.  Best of all, due to the fact that the price will increase by less than the increase in fuel economy, as an end result we may see an overall decrease in the cost of fuel/mile.  Some deeper analysis will definately be required, but a steadily increasing gas tax is most definately something that should be considered due to the wide range of positive benefits and comparatively few detriments.  Your thoughts are appreciated.  Edit: I just realized that the corrective effect on the current account deficit IS still quite large, at somewhere around .5% of GDP.  The fact that it is only 1/10th of the deficit now is only due to the fact the deficit as a whole is so large.  The improvement in the balance will be relativly constant as a % of GDP, as opposed to a % of the deficit.

      I found  urlLink this  a week or so ago, and it's finally working now.  Likely it got linked to too much recently and so was bogged down.  Anyway, it's an interactive map of the USA, showing breaking down of what languages are spoken where.  Rather interesting, if you are into that sort of thing.  The analysis for where I live is interesting.  Here are a few notable statistics:  English outranks other languages by a factor of 10 to 1.  156 people speak a language I have neither ever heard or, nor likely can pronounce: Gujarathi  Only 24 people speak the Scandinavian languages.  Which is a pity, as right now I am taking the time to learn Swedish.  But, I guess that means I am consistent in my pursuit for totally irrelevant knowledge. :P  What is interesting about where you live?

      I finally made an appointment with an oral surgeon to have my wisdom teeth taken out.  All four of them.  Guess how much it's going to cost.  Here's a hint: Look at the title of this post.  Ouch.  Fortunately, this is just the high end.  Also fortunately, is I have the money for it, although it's going to eat up 75% of the wad of cash I had sitting around that was helping me make it from month to month.  Well, at least it's done now.  I've been putting this off for about 5 years.  No more things to remember to initiate on my part.  Two months from now I head in, and have them yanked.  Oh!  And good news, they use a "Twilight Sleep" on me while they do it.  I get to be knocked out!  That will certainly  make the procedure itself more bearable.  I wonder...will they try to collect the money before I am drugged up, or after.  I think I shall have to be careful.  So, anyone else ever have their teeth taken out?

      Well, right now is the summer solstice.  Yes, right this very instant.  At least this instant that I am posting this.  What is the solstice?  It's the time of year when the sun reaches it highest point in the sky.  For those in the Northern Hemisphere at least.  It's the lowest point for those in the Southern.  If you happen to live on the Tropic of Cancer, the sun should have been directly overhead.  It is, also, the longest day of the year, as a result.  Then again, I somehow doubt I have any readers in Mexico, the Sahara, Saudi Arabia, India, China or Taiwan.  What the summer solstice means in astronomical terms, is that the North Pole is now pointing in the direction of the sun.  No, not directly, that would just be weird.  In order for that to happen the Earth would have to have a tilt of it's axis 90 degrees off in relation to its orbit around the sun.  It would make an interesting SciFi story at least though.  With the Earth having a 90 degree tilt, the North Pole would have the sun be directly over head.  All day.  Can you say hot?  No ice caps here.  At least not during summer.  The south pole would be in total darkness the entire day, along with everywhere else south of the equator.  It would make for one wicked weather system.  I wonder if any planet tilted like that could naturally evolve life.  Or rather, intelligent life.  I suppose such life would have to develop underground.  That would be the only way to survive long enough to wait out the cold, cold, winters, and hot, hot, summers.  The Planet of the Dwarves.  Has a nice ring to it.  Let's see, what else would this planet have.  Ice caps?  Not permanent if they were at the poles.  Based on an article I read on Mars, I would suspect we might find permanent glaciers between 10 and 20 degrees north and south of the equator.  Why there?  Well, the equator will be the spot on the  PotD  that has the sun overhead for the least amount of time.  It would pass directly overhead twice a year though, on the equinoxes, just like on Earth.  The rate that the Sun would move is the fastest during that time.  On Earth, the days get shorter after the summer solstice.  Slowly at first, then more rapidly, until the autumn equinox arrives.  Then the rate of change in the length of days slows down, until the winter solstice, when the process reverses and the days start to get longer.  The same thing happens for any planet, regardless of its tilt.  On the Planet of the Dwarves, this would cause the Sun to be overhead the poles for an extended period of time.  As the days get further away from the solstices, the sun will move towards the equator, but will quickly brush past.  This would make being near the equators the best place for permanent ice caps to develop.  Although not actually on the equator, as it would still get sunlight all year round, even though it would be essentially a days long sunrise/sunset at that solstices.    So, with ice caps 10-20 degrees away from the equator, the sun will spend a very short time each year directly overhead. Most of the ice melt will occur at this time, and it will happen twice a year at the equinoxes.  The Sun will then move towards the poles, dropping in the sky from the point of view of the ice caps until its only 10-20 degrees above the horizon, although never setting.  During this time the ice will be able to stabilize and add to itself enough to survive the return trip of the Sun.  As the sun passes overhead again, the days will get shorter and shorter, until a extended night sets in.  During this time any buildup will be completely protected from melting.  Hmm...ok, so I got a little off subject, but not really.  I like to ponder strange things, get used to it. :P  Update: Here is a nice  urlLink link  showing the movement of the sun over the course of a year.

      I just got finished watching  urlLink Patch Adams , and the movie inspired me to write this post.  Patch Adams is an ENFP.  I could explain what those individual letters mean, but that doesn't explain what an ENFP is, nor can it explain any other type.  The personalities are too complex for that.  ENFPs are those energetic people with vision.  That was readily visible in watching the movie about Patch.  They can see things, and dream, better than any other type, in my opinion.  The pages I have read about ENFPs state that they have visions to change the world, or at least parts of it.  They don't let can'ts and not possibles deter them.  They see beyond that, to what is possible.  They are essential to the advancement of the human race.  And I don't mean in economic terms, although it can be in that way.  Rather they are those people out there that seek to find the greatest potential in everything and everyone, and then try to find a way to achieve it.  With all that enthusiasm and energy comes their weakness too.  An ENFP that is discouraged, depressed, repressed, or oppressed is a sad sight to see.  Their visions turn dark, they hide from other people, and they give up.  If you've seen the movie, you saw that happen to Patch after his girlfriend Carin died.  Everyone needs a friend who is an ENFP.  But even more so, every ENFP needs a friend.  Someone who is willing to listen to, and even participate in their visions.  Someone who won't let them just quit, or hide, when things get to tough.  Someone who is there for them.    ENFPs can't work on their own.  They need other people to make their visions become reality.  Take Patch.  He didn't try to think in a small cubicle, by himself.  He went out and got involved doing what he wanted.  He then recruited others, even if they resisted, to join him.  He didn't start his clinic alone, but got others to work with him, and share his dream.  And today, due to his work and others, it's becoming a  urlLink reality.   Are you up to the challenge to help the world, one ENFP at a time?  The future of the human race is counting on you.

      Yesterday I discovered something rather interesting about fusion.  I already knew the basic process of protons fusing together to make helium and release energy.  (If you thought hydrogen fused together to make helium, you are correct, as hydrogen is simply an atom with only a single proton for a nucleus.)  What I didn't know, was how the actual fusion process took place.  Apparently, before the advancement of quantum physics, classical physics could not explain how it was possible for nuclear fusion to take place.  This was due to the fact that the sun was not sufficiently massive enough to make the protons (which are positively charged, and as such repel each other) fuse.  Reading a  urlLink website  yesterday, suddenly made it make sense.  Everything in the universe is not made up of particles, but is rather in a state that is both particle and wave.  The wave portion is a probability wave that determines where an object is.  Instead of having a definite positions, it  could  be here, or it  could  be a little ways over there.  It turns out, that although the intense pressure and gravity of the sun is not able to overpower the repulsive force of two protons, it  is  powerful enough to push them close enough together so that their probability waves overlap to an extent, so there is a small chance that at any one moment they will both be in the same position.  And when they are, they fuse.  Now this got me thinking about gravity.  Just looking at what I just described it looks similar to what gravity does.  Two objects are mutually attracted to each other.  What if gravity works on the same principle?  What if the probability waves of matter interacted in such a way, that they had an  additive  effect.  Imagine two objects in space.  Both have probability waves that describe their location.  Good chance here, small chance there, really small, but still a chance that its way over there.  Now, as these two objects got close to each other, they would start increasing each other's probability of being in the space between the two of them.  As a result, over time, and more quickly as the mass increased or distance decreased, the objects would move closer.  Sounds just like what Einstein's gravity does, doesn't it?  It needs a lot of work though I think.  For one, I realized while writing this that photons would be affected by this, but could not add to the effect.  The other problem is that this seems so blindingly obvious to me, as someone who knows very little about physics, quantum or otherwise, that someone would have already thought of this and crunched the numbers.   Update:   Another big problem, I forgot all about time dilation.  Duh me.

      No, seriously, it's a very interesting topic, as long as you have a good teacher.  Fortunately, I did in the book  urlLink The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality  by Brian Greene.    In it, he explains in very down to Earth terms how the universe works, according to quantum physics.  My aroused my interest the most, was an example of the fact that observing something changes its outcome.  Now, most people nowadays will have heard something to that effect regarding quantum physics.  What most people  don't  know however, is that if you erase that observation, the particles you observed return to the state they were in before you observed them.  Freaky, huh?  Let me give an extremely simplified explanation.    Photons are shot from an emitter, into a beam splitter, towards two mirrors, which both bounce the photons back to the same spot on a detector.  This creates an interference pattern, due to the wave-like nature of the photons.    To understand an interference pattern, just think of a wave in a tub of water, it is split in two, bounces off the sides, then converges again further along the line.  Where it converges there are points where two crests meet, making the wave twice as high, where two troughs meet, twice as low,  and  points where a trough and crest meet, canceling each other out.  This pattern of highs, lows and nothings is the interference pattern.  Photons (light) do this because it is made up of probability waves, which interfere with each other when it is split, and it makes a pattern of alternating light and dark on the detector.  Attempting to detect whether a photon goes towards one mirror or the other after going through the splitter, will cause the interference pattern to disappear.    However , if you were to set up a splitter along each path, then bounce the new paths along to the same detector, thereby making it impossible to know which path it came from, you can restore the interference pattern. *  This means that it is  not  the act of observing that is causing the change.  Disturbing the photons is not what is causing the interference pattern, but rather the fact that we  can  observe which path they took that is causing the pattern to disappear.  Once the observational data is destroyed, completely and irretrievably, even in principle, the interference pattern returns even though we are still messing with the photons.  Freaky.  * EDIT: A little clarification on the second to last paragraph, where I bolded it.  When you set up a splitter along each path it is a different kind than the first splitter.  The first splitter causes the photons to go along one of two paths, the bolded sentence splitter actually creates two entangled photons, one which continues along the original path, and another that is sent along to the detector.  Entangled photons, for all intents and purposes, act in unison as if they were the same photon.    If a detector is set along each path, to determine which direction the photon took, the interference pattern is destroyed.  If however the photons are directed from the splitters along each path to the same detector, instead of separate ones, then it is impossible to determine which path the photon took, then the interference pattern is restored.  Hope that's clearer.

      Browsing  urlLink Marginal Revolution  today, I noticed Tyler Cowen has a post up that nicely compliments my post from  urlLink earlier  today.  Some of the figures in his article differ from those in my data, however that is likely due to how I choose to interpret "Foreign official assets in the United States" as central bank holdings in  urlLink my data source .  His analysis is considerably more optimistic than mine, as mine seems to fit largely into his last explanation for why foreigners are buying so many Treasuries:   7. They are just plain, flat-out stupid. I call this the uh-oh scenario. They won't stay stupid forever.  More the uh-oh part than the stupid.  Of additional interest to me is that Tyler seems to have  urlLink once again  changed the attitude of his post from a negative view, to a more neutral one.  How can I tell? Check the link name, it's based on the title of a post when it is posted.  Hmm, it appears this is another of his posts  urlLink I blogged about .  I think I need more blogs with trackbacks to visit, as all of my site hits seem to come either from my own pimping, or from Marginal Revolution trackbacks.  Tyler might think I am stalking him.  Although he has piqued my interest.  His habit of changing post titles, overall competence, and  urlLink other indications  suggest to me that it is possible he may be  urlLink INTP .  Hmm, 7 links in one post, I think that's a record for me.

      Ha, a right-winger saying that, now that's a sight.  After all, what's illusionary about it?  Over a million jobs in the past few months, phenomenal growth, stock market is up significantly verses a year ago.  That's the current picture that most people are seeing.  Here is what I am seeing however.  During the boom years (1998-2000) we saw an increase in both imports and exports to the U.S.  However, imports increased by approximately twice as much as exports did.  During the subsequent recession and slow recovery (2001-2003) we saw both imports and exports decrease at first.  Towards 2003 however, imports had fully recovered, while exports were still down from the highs in 2000.  For that to be able to happen, we must have money coming in from somewhere to balance the gap.  For that we look at the financial account during that period.  Foreign investment increased rapidly during the boom years, and tapered off somewhat afterwards, but not anywhere near to where it had been in 1998.  It was in fact still almost double in 2003 of what it had been in '98.  It's composition had changed dramatically however.  Most of the inflows during boom times were into securities, direct investment, and private debt.  Comparatively little was in public debt (Treasuries).  In the following recession and recovery, inflows shifted heavily into public debt, comprising more than half of the total inflows.  Outflows were comparatively unchanged except for a large reduction of private lending to foreigners.  As a result, we went from a large trade deficit at the end of the boom times financed by foreign investment, to a larger deficit at the end of the recovery period financed in large part by foreign lending (foreign purchases of Treasuries).  About 2/3 of this debt is being financed by private foreign investors, the other 1/3 by their governments.  That is a cause for worry in my opinion, especially as interest rates are set to rise soon.  As rates rise, the value of the debt drops.  If foreign investors decide they do not want to continue taking the risk we will end up seeing a large outflow very quickly.  This is not even counting what foreign governments will do, as they will want to protect their investments as well.  In fact, China is already moving some of its large assets out of dollar assets and into yen as reported by the Wall Street Journal on Monday.  What really worries me however, is something I wrote about  urlLink before .  After the boom times, the trade deficit was large, and the economy went into recession as a result.  Normally this should have caused imports to drop, until exports could be increased to pay for them.  Tax cuts were quickly passed however, which allowed consumers to keep importing large amounts.  Between 2000 and 2003 the drop in government revenue (aka tax cuts) amounted to $243 billion.  Had there not been any tax cuts, the recession would have been much worse, however the private sector would have shifted its behavior to adjust to the times.  Instead, because a significant part of the deficit was a result of tax cuts, private sector behavior remained little changed, hence the result that imports recovered quickly without exports.  So, while the administration has said that it believes market forces should correct the current account deficit, its very actions have directly fought against any correction!  Now the current state of things is looking decidedly unstable.  As  urlLink Buttonwood  put it in an opinion article I read yesterday:   In his idle moments, Buttonwood wonders what would happen to the American economy were property prices to tank, at the same time that oil prices soared and the fiscal stimulus ran out. It wouldn't look pretty, that's for sure.   His article (worth reading) talks more about domestic debt, and how so much more of it is vulnerable to rate changes today.  Combined with foreign debt, and no wonder investors are nervous about stocks.  Combined with my belief that the economy never got a chance to naturally correct its trade imbalance, and I am keeping most of my assets out of U.S. stocks.  My primary sources of trade data is  urlLink here , and my budget data  urlLink here .

      A strange request, no?  Well, a little background first.  I work at the family bakery with my dad.  A little over a year ago my dad told me that he could only afford to pay me part time.  Finances were tight, and things weren't looking good.  So, as a result my work schedule dropped from 4 days at 10-12 hours each, to 2 days.  My income dropped accordingly.  From that point I went from having a nice surplus each month that I put into investments, to having just barely enough to break even each month.  If I could go back to work full time now though, I wouldn't.  I have come to greatly value my free time.  I have used the time to learn many new things, ranging from personality types, to quantum physics.  This current setup is almost like a dream for any INTP.  The problem though, is now my dad has put the bakery up for sale.  I am looking at, not 2 days a week of work, but 0.  That means new job.  And damnit, I don't wanna.  What can I do though? I have about $1000 a month in expenses I need to cover.  Here are my options:  1. Get another job.  Not ideal, because a) I likely would get a lower pay rate than I am receiving now, meaning I couldn't work just part time.  And b) any job that I would be well suited for mentally, will likely require a college degree of some sort.  I hate physical labor, not because I am lazy, but just because I can feel my mind rotting from disuse.  I will have to do some searching, although I'm not sure where to begin.  2. Get a roommate to help with expenses. Actually, I'd rather work than do that.  3. Move to a cheaper place, as half my expenses are rent.  I might, except for the fact that I am renting from my sister, which means I have an excellent landlord.  Also, it's her policy not to increase rents on current tenants.  That means my housing expenses are immune to inflation.  4. Shop more frugally.  Ha! The only place to save money is likely on food.  Although I may be able to squeeze a bit out of there, as I'm currently shopping at an above average price store.  5. Generate income from various sources.  This is the one I like, and it's where you come in.  With a bit of luck, and some work, I can get multiple revenue streams from such sources as my investments, this blog, eBay, and even perhaps an online game I am working on.  All of these are long shots for income, but I will never know if I can if I don't try.  So, if you like reading my blog, and you are financially well off, feel free to donate.  Now, I don't really expect to get much, or even really anything, but as I said, I won't know if I don't try.  So...help me stay unemployed!

      Yes, you remember  urlLink Lakisha , don't you?  Well, just the other day she initiated communication with me through  urlLink eHarmony.com .  To respond though, costs $50!  I don't know about you, but right now I'm not really willing to spend that much of my own money just to initiate a conversation.  I am however willing to spend your money.  Huh?  Look to the right.  I've discovered Amazon's Honor System.  It lets people send me money through the website, without me having to handle any payment information.  Do I expect anyone to give me anything? No.  However, if anyone suggests I should actually try to look for a girl, I now have a link to give such people, so they can put their money where their mouth is.  Clever, eh?  So, donate, and help find me a girl!  Oh, and if you donate, but I don't collect enough to subscribe, the Amazon system lets you get a refund of your money for up to 30 days after you give. I'm going to leave this up a maximum of two weeks.  If I don't have enough by then, I'll take the pay button down and let you all know to request refunds from Amazon (if anyone actually donates anything that is).

      Praise their partner.  No, seriously, it works.  I used to joke that I helped break up two marriages.  It was an amusing correlation that I drew.  I start talking to a person having marriage problems, but is sticking it out.  Then later they reach the point that they break up with their spouse.  Now, I didn't actually blame myself for it, as in both cases the spouse (both men) was not being a good husband, even to the point of being emotionally abusive/manipulative.  More so it was as I said, an amusing connection.  However, it lurked in the back of my mind that maybe I did affect things somehow, and something I read recently solidified that feeling.  The book I was reading is called  urlLink How to Win Friends & Influence People .  Doesn't quite sound like a book to get ideas on breaking up couples, now does it?  Bear with me.  Part III, Chapter 1 is titled: You can't win an argument.  The reason for this, is that when you argue with someone, you are putting them on the defensive.  Even if you succeed in the logic, and defeat them, you still likely haven't converted them to your way of thinking.  Why? People are emotional beings.  As such:   A person convinced against their will, is of the same opinion still.  So, how do you convince people? The book recommends agreeing with them.  Once they are no longer feeling the need to defend their positions, they are open to your ideas.  Ok, so how does this relate to breaking up relationships?  Simple.  Most people that want to break two people up, will go to their friend and try to point out all the bad things about their partner.  This instinctively causes the friend to become defensive and try to rationalize and play down the things their partner has done.  Now, I've been accused of being a nice guy, and as such I try to look for the good in people, and try to look for ways to help people work out their problems, where I can at least.  Looking back, what I now believe I was doing was giving my friends a chance to, for themselves, see the bad traits in their partner.  They've always known they were there, they likely even told other people about those traits.  But usually those other people will likely agree with their friend's assessment, causing the friend to second guess, and make excuses.  With my habit of not attacking my friend's partner, and even trying to point out the good, my friend would finally have a chance for their brain to process the bad traits without being defensive.  It's an interesting theory at least.  Now, don't read what I've written the wrong way.  First, I don't blame myself for breaking them up, as in both cases I believe the relationships were unhealthy.  Second, this technique will not work on a fundamentally healthy relationship, due to the fact that the negative traits must actually be present before they can be acknowledged.  Side note: One of said friends came up with the second half of the title to this post.

      Ok, some of you have probably looked at the name I use to sign my posts, and wondered "WTF does that mean?"  Some of you already know me from elsewhere on the internet, and so recognize the name.  Others though have followed a link here and likely have no clue.  Well, at first I wasn't sure how to explain it, as I have a different explanation depending on how I know a person.  For those I know  IRL  I say Birdeye is the name of my favorite donut I enjoyed while growing up.  With the family business being a bakery, certain perks go along with it.  Including my dad being willing to bring home my favorite donut when he gets home from work...which is around the time Saturday morning cartoons started.  The donut itself is a chocolate covered raised dough roll, with a big dab of frosting in the middle.  For other people, namely those that I've met through an  urlLink online community  the name has a different origin.  This site is actually where I invented the name.  It was inspired by a quote about my favorite character in the book series that the site is based around.  Shortly put, the quote mentioned how this character's eyes look like a "bird studying a worm."  That gave me the inspiration to make the name Birdeye.  Incidentally, later I determined that this character, Verin, is an INTP.  But, what does the name mean here?  Well, being not overly attached to the idea of having to have a single explanation for what my name means, I've created another one.  It's how INTPs like to look at things, all at once, from a distance to get a good perspective.  Getting a bird's eye view of the picture.  So, yeah, that works.

      Well, I've discovered how I can post pictures to my blog now.  I found out how while reading my copy of the  WSJ .  It's a lovely little program called  urlLink Hello .  Silly me, after I read the name, I realized there was a  urlLink link  explaining it on the main page of  urlLink Blogger .  The nice thing about this program is it's not restricted for use in blogs.  It's actually an instant messaging program that is designed to be able to rapidly share pictures with other people.  The blog part just works by sending the pics to a IM buddy named BloggerBot.  So, in any case, I can add pictures now.  And you can look forward to seeing some from time to time.  Oh, and I'm using this post to test out the queuing feature where you can save a picture and have it automatically added to your next post.   urlLink      Didn't work quite like I had thought, but at least I've figured out how to manually move the pictures around.

       urlLink Google Answers  is a project of Google's that looks absolutely fascinating.  People can ask questions, and then others, called Researchers, answer them for a price.  Already I found  urlLink one question  for $200 for which I was able to find the answer rather quickly just by looking in material I already have.  I even responded with a comment.  If my answer is good enough, I just saved this guy $200 from having to wait for a Researcher to find the answer.  Unfortunately, they are  urlLink not currently accepting applicants  for new Researchers.  However, once they start again, I am most certainly going to apply!    Wish me luck.

      I was inspired by a recent post by Tyler Cowen at  urlLink Marginal Revolution  to figure out how, and if,  urlLink personality types  relate to political leanings.  In my analysis I found some relationships that made perfect sense, and some that puzzled me.  For those interested,  urlLink here  is my source.  Since the quantity of types, and type combinations is huge, I will only be highlighting those that I found significant.  My source was a website stating the results of questions asked of about 1200 people.  Those people chose one of 7 options to describe their political leanings.  The options were: Democrat, Republican, Not Political, Middle of the Road, Liberal, Conservative, Libertarian, and Other.  Keep in mind while viewing the figures, that since those polled can only choose one of the 7 choices, it is entirely possible for any one category to show an increase in two polarly opposite political views.  The first that surprised me not at all, was that ISTJs are 41% more likely than the average responder in this survey to consider themselves Republican.  Reading from any of the descriptions around the web you can easily see why:   ISTJs...are hardworking.  They honor their commitments...They have a strong internal sense of duty...They place great importance on honesty and integrity and can be depended on to do the right thing for their families and communities.  All hallmarks of how Republican tend to think of themselves.  ISFPs also tend to depart sharply from the normal, being 30% more likely to be Democrats, and more than 40% less likely than average to say they are Republicans.  A shorthand way of describing the ISFP is as the "Stop and smell the roses" type.  Not shocking to see their general political views lean as they do.  For each full type I have calculated the percentages and their deviations from the survey's 'normal', however due to the fact that the sample sizes are so small for each type, the results for most tend to be skewed.  The remainder of the results are those from partial types, that include more than a single full type.  Looking broadly, just one letter at a time, the one that stands out the most is the iNtuitive, who scored as 24% more likely to be Liberal than average.  As Liberals tend to take a larger world view than what they believe others take, it makes sense that the type that sees the big picture when dealing with things would correspond with that political position.  Intuitives also score lower for both political parties, showing that they are less likely to be willing to label themselves so narrowly, which further corresponds to their nature.  Looking at the four main  urlLink temperament  types the biggest deviation appears in the  NT  type, showing them as 44% more likely to call themselves Liberal than average, mostly for the same reason as Ns in general.  Another big deviation is in the  SP  temperament, which scored as 35% more likely to declare themselves as Middle of the Road.  As  SP  types are "If I can't see it, I don't believe it" it is likely that this is a result of politicians failing to fulfill their promises.  In other words,  SPs  never actually 'see' an political path that they can believe in.  The  IJ  subtype is the one that gave me the strangest results of all the types.  They scored as almost 24% more likely to be Republican and 13% more likely to be Conservative than normal.  The corresponding scores for Democrat and Liberal are either flat, or slightly down.  What could cause this political leaning, I am honestly unsure.  The prize of the "Most Different" goes to the  EN  types however.  These types scored a whopping 60% more likely to consider themselves Liberal, and eighty and seventy percent more likely to have chosen Other or Libertarian, respectively.  Due to the exceeding small sample size though, the last two results are less significant.  The Liberal title however fits very nicely with the iNtuitive tendency in general to lean Liberal, for the same reasons as stated above.  They also were about a third less likely to choose either the Middle of the Road, or Not Political options.  In general they appear less likely to just let things just pass them by, and so take a stand in large numbers.  It took me probably 4 hours to compile and calculate all these statistics from my source, but it was worth it.  The results were incredibly intriguing to me.  Hope you found them interesting too.

      Specifically, the  MBTI  that I refer to here regularly.  This typing system is fairly useful for understanding the different 'types' of people out there.  To call them personality types is a bit of a misnomer however, as culture, upbringing, and other environmental factors all contribute.  The types are excellent however in describing how our minds work, in terms of taking in information and making decisions.  More so than anything else I've read about.    The four preferences:  Extroversion vs. Introversion Sensing vs. Intuition Thinking vs. Feeling Judging vs. Perceiving  The first preference does not mean shy vs. social.  It is simply the default and most comfortable way that people act.  Generally speaking introverts get their energy from solitude, while extroverts get it from other people.  The second preference has to do with the forest and the trees.  Sensors like details, and so are good at focusing, but also getting stuck not seeing the forest for the trees.  Intuitives like the big picture, and dealing with issues more abstractly, but can lack practicality by not seeing the trees for the forest.  Both these are considered 'Perceiving' functions.  The third preference is likely the easiest to understand.  Thinking tends to deal with logic.  Feeling does deal with emotions, but more so it refers to a persons values.  Both of these are referred to as 'Judging' functions.  The fourth preference has to deal with which of the second or third preferences is extroverted.  If it is Perceiving, then the second preference (whether Sensing or Intuition) is extroverted, making the person laid back and flexible.  If it is Judging, then the third preference will be extroverted, making the person more focused and strict.  These four preferences actually break down into 4 different functions, but that is more complex than I want to get into right now.  Likely more so than you want to hear either, so I will stop here.   Update:  I now have  urlLink a post  up explaining the function breakdown.

      I arrived home yesterday, and found her just lying on the floor, not willing to move.  Adding to the fact she was in the same condition that morning, I decided I couldn't wait until her appointment today to have her put down.  So, I called the vet, and got them to let me just drop her off, so they could put her to sleep when they had the time.  Expensive place, $65 to have her put down and to bury her.  But, what can you expect from a vet in a town called 'Richland'?  I miss her, and it still hasn't fully sunk in that she is gone.

      Poor Tiger.  She's 15 years old, and has stopped eating.  Took her to the vet today.  Two hours, and $136 later, they told me she has kidney failure.  She can't be cured, but might be able to be gotten back to normal via periodic fluid injections to help clear stuff out.  That's what I am trying right now.  They did a fluid injection (which Tiger hated) and now she is back home with me.  We go back Tuesday to see if it helped at all.  If not, I'm having her put down.  Sadly, so far, Tiger is acting no better. :(

      ...you buy a game that has been on the market for a year, and it still barely runs.  I just bought  urlLink Warcraft III  off of eBay the other day.  It took a defrag, and shutting off all my  IM  programs in order for there to be enough memory for it to run.  Fortunately, it at least  does  work.  Fun game too.  So far I've just completed the first few Human chapters.  Currently on level 6...the game actually has me killing townspeople so they don't turn into the undead.  Amusing.  I lost the first time through this level, going to give it another go tonight.  Just another distraction to take my mind off stuff.   Update:  Turns out much of the problem was some scratches on the CD.  After sticking in the expansion, which seemed to work fine, I discovered the problem wasn't my RAM at all.  So, I contacted the seller, and he let me ship it back to him for a refund.

      A few weeks ago I made one of my  urlLink first posts  on this plan.  Just today I found it finally making the rounds, when I saw Tyler Cowen  urlLink post  about it.   If the plan interested you at all, follow the links back to see what he, and others wrote on the subject.  I don't have anything really new to add to what I had written before.  So why am I making another post about it?  Simple, to exploit the trackback function to get some people that care about economics to read my other stuff.  And to see that I reported this plan almost 3 weeks ago.  But, as new kid on the block, can't really expect anyone to have seen it. ;)  Hey, at least I'm honest my motives.

      Can't blame you.  An article in the  WSJ  today states:   A good historical novel...transports readers, as though by a time machine, to a world where not only the curses, hairpieces and grog are authentic but also the beliefs and prejudices of ordinary people.  Historical fiction lets you look back in time through the eyes of its participants, instead of through the eyes of a historical.  The great thing about the world today is, thanks to the internet, we no long have to wait years or decades for someone to write about how somewhere else in the world really was like.  We have blogs.  For those that have not wandered around at all on my little blog, I point your attention to the upper right area, where there is a list of other blogs.  The (currently) second from the top one is called  urlLink Iraq the Model .  Clicking here will bring you face to face with 3 brothers who live in Baghdad, writing about their views and experiences, and hopes for their country.  Reading that blog, and the other Iraqi blogs they link, you can get a more personal view of events in the world.  In addition, all but the most stolid America-hater I suspect will be moved by the posts made there to, if they were not already, become more interested in seeing Iraqis win, than seeing America 'lose'.  So, check it out, its like historical fiction in there here and now.  Without the historical or fiction parts of course.

      Recently, I discovered an  urlLink article  at  urlLink Marginal Revolution  on whether there is any truth to the idea that social transfers hurt growth in welfare states.  Most people's intuition says yes, this article challenges that intuitive conclusion.  To put the paper's conclusions' simply, the answer is no, there is not a significant loss to GDP.  How can this be so?  The answer is in the form of a variety of reasons.  First is that models used to estimate social spending costs, are not actually practiced by any states today, or that the estimates are extrapolated beyond that which has actually be practiced.  Second, believe it or not, but welfare states have a more regressive tax policy that is more efficient in terms of economic growth than in non-welfare states.  Additionally, disincentives to work are designed in such a way as to prevent a negative impact on GDP growth.  The third main reason is the core of why the previous two are true.  It is simply that whenever a bad choice is made, it becomes very obvious very fast in a high tax welfare state.  This is realized on both the tax side and the recipient side.  On the taxing side, it gives the example of the double taxation of dividends.  Welfare states tend to be much more capital friendly, and do not tax businesses twice as a result.  The United States on the other hand, has only recently reduced the double taxation.  As a result, welfare states are able to attract capital much more easily that one would assume.  The overall mix of taxation is more efficient to growth as well.  Higher income tax along with higher consumption taxes result in a broader income base, while also tending to tax those who are receiving the services, so the next transfer from one income group to another is reduced.  On the recipient side there are multiple external effects from social transfers.  Three areas that the paper touched on were retirement, health, and education.  The externalities of health and education are fairly obvious, as the better people perform at their jobs will of course has a positive effect on GDP.  As for retirement, the paper theorized that by removing older, less efficient workers from the workplace, the overall worker productivity improved.  This view sits well in my mind, as many businesses are known to discriminate against older workers for that precise reason.  All in all I found this paper quite informative, although I still have my reservations.  I have, for a while, observed that the least efficient economies in the world seem to be those that have both larger populations and larger welfare states.  As a result, there can be major cultural differences of opinion on what should be provided by the state, within these states.  The point that the article made about democracy creating a form of cost control is certainly evident in the political history of the U.S.  In 1994, when faced with the possibility of a major shift in the structure of health care, there was a major revolt against the Democratic party, from which it has yet to fully recover.  Essentially a system that was perceived to be inefficient was blocked before it ever could take effect.  Additionally, if there is no loss to GDP, why do welfare states tend to have a noticeably lower GDP per head?  Note, this does not mean they have a lower standard of living.  Such a comparison would be much more difficult to quantify.  Also, states that have a lower GDP tend to benefit from being indirectly subsidized by those with higher GDPs, sometimes in the form of adopting another's technological advance, sometimes by gaining by having an economic model based on exporting to those 'richer' countries.  All in all, I agree with what I see as the author's conclusion: With democracy forming a kind of cost control, a country can increase the size of its welfare state, and still remain efficient as the political trade winds will blow more fiercely as reality makes itself evident.  In other words:  To each their own.

      Took them a little while, but they found someone that's compatible:   Lakisha   Nice name   Lakisha's friends describe her as:  Sweet  Affectionate  Modest  Good listener    Sounds like someone I could get along with.    The most important thing Lakisha is looking for in a person is:  A good heart and a kind personality.    Hmm...my friends I think would describe me as that.  Getting better.   Three of Lakisha's best life-skills are:  Entertaining in my home  Communicating my innermost thoughts and feelings  Being a good friend and companion     Oh dear, they've found me an ESFJ. *shudder*   The things Lakisha can't live without are:  My car  T.V.  Music - any kind  Pet's  Friends     Can't live without T.V.? And she was starting to sound so good.    Except for that ESFJ thing, of course.

      Guest blogger Bryan Caplan over at  urlLink Marginal Revolution  has an  urlLink interesting post  on a  urlLink paper (pdf) he wrote.  I finally managed to get around to finish reading the paper today.  It is definitely worth a look for anyone interested in economics.  Essentially it works like this:  1. Good policies cause good growth.  2. Good growth causes good ideas.  3. Good ideas cause good policies.  Note that the ordering of which is first is largely arbitrary on my part.  Step 3 directly affects step one, as it is a continuing cycle.  In this context the ideas are the public's perception of what works.  Step one is pretty intuitive.  Step three is also intuitive, as if a public supports a good idea it will likely be implemented or sustained as a policy.  Step two is more complex, as there can either be a positive or negative feedback at this step.  Basically, if there is positive feedback then when there is good growth the public recognizes it and encourages the policies that created it to continue.  The same is true if there is bad growth.  The people believe the ideas  should  work, they just need to be implemented more aggressively, so bad policies can also receive the public's support.  A quick note on terminology.  Positive feedback means self sustaining, not producing good results.  Negative feedback means self defeating, and does not refer necessarily to bad events.  Point in fact, there can be negative feedback, instead of positive, in the step two above.  An example of this is that if there is good growth, the public decides to change it's direction, perhaps to implement more 'equal' policies, and so causes economically worse policies.  This then causes slower growth.  If growth slows enough, the negative feedback kicks in again, and the ideas of the public about what is good policy changes to cause better policies.  From this, economies that have a negative feedback in step two (the only step that can have negative feedback, the other two always have positive, meaning self reinforcing) always tend to result in having an overall mediocre performance.  When things get good, growth is diverted away for other purposes, when it gets bad, the people  urlLink become more open to change .  For economies in with positive feedback in all three steps, these are those that are stuck in the 'Idea Trap'.  When things are good, they stay good.  When things are bad, they stay bad.  Only random shocks apparently can change the state an economy is in, as there is no self correcting mechanism for those with positive feedback from growth to ideas.  Overall, interesting concept.

      Or at least google's search rank.  Currently a search for 'intp' will yield my blog as the 27th listing.  Just a few weeks ago I was somewhere in the 80s.  On more specific subjects, I rank even better.  Currently 11th, up from 12th a few days ago, for searches for  urlLink Robert Shrum .  Not that I know much about the guy other than that one post.  Or really care.  I used to get some hits from my  urlLink personality and politics post , but that appears to have dropped off google's radar.  Ah well, times change.  So, anyway, I'm just happy.  Higher rankings = more hits.  It's been a while now since I could visit my blog and see the hit counter not move at all.  Rare now are those days.  Yay!

      Browsing  urlLink Mahalanobis's  archives of old posts, I stumbled upon this  urlLink Morality Quiz .  Here are my results:   Your Moralising Quotient of 0.17 compares to an average Moralising Quotient of 0.22. This means that as far as the events depicted in the scenarios featured in this activity are concerned you are more permissive than average.  Your Interference Factor of 0.00 compares to an average Interference Factor of 0.13. This means that as far as the events depicted in the scenarios featured in this activity are concerned you are less likely to recommend societal interference in matters of moral wrongdoing, in the form of prevention or punishment, than average.  Your Universalising Factor of 0.50 compares to an average Universalising Factor of 0.37. This means you are more likely than average to see moral wrongdoing in universal terms - that is, without regard to prevailing cultural norms and social conventions (at least as far as the events depicted in the scenarios featured in this activity are concerned).  Their results are largely consistent with how I think of myself.  If you intend to take the quiz yourself, you should stop reading this post first, as my reasoning may temporarily influence your own.  Mostly I tried to look at the questions based on whether a person was internally consistent.  I believe what I believe, but don't believe that other people should be held to my standards or judged by my beliefs.    I  do  however believe they should be accountable to their own values.  Few things irk me more than people violating their own stated beliefs and values.  If you don't intend to act in a certain way, don't pretend that you will.  In one example from the quiz, it appears I am definitely in the minority in this respect:   You judged the failure of the son to visit his mother's grave once a week as he promised to be wrong. 12% of the people who have undertaken this activity to date agree with you.  In that same light I believe that people should not judge others just because they have different values and priorities.  I am tired of those who hate people, or entire cultures, who share different values than themselves.  As such they develop a strong hatred towards those people or cultures that seems to make them look for everything wrong with their beliefs.  They then readily accept any negative suggestion and dismiss out of hand any positive result of those beliefs.  No way of doing something is perfect.  Some ways are distinctly better than others.  Promoting hatred however is no way to get people to look at things differently.  Hatred creates stubbornness, and makes people resistant to change, not more accepting to it.

      As most people who get around on the internet will remember, a couple or so weeks ago, an amusing little video was posted making fun of Bush and Kerry. The site that made it, and where you can find the video if you are unfamiliar with it, is called  urlLink JibJab . Basically it mocks both of them, and gives a very good, short example of why Americans always seem to consider their choice of President as the lesser of two evils.   The way most people found this video was through links from blogs. A blog somewhere likely got it from being subscribed to JibJab's newsletter, then put it on their blog. As happens in the Blogsphere, other bloggers visited that site, found it funny, and linked it from their own. In likely a very short time this link made its rounds to the biggest of the blogs, where it quickly spread to just about everyone on the internet that doesn't live under a rock (It was linked 3 times on a message board I visit, and was in many of the major blogs I visit.)   What is interesting though is that this reminded me of what I read in the book  urlLink Linked: How Everything Is Connected to Everything Else . This book is about networks, and how things, well, link together. From what I remember, there are two parts to a linked network. Links and nodes. Links connect nodes to each other, and the number of links a node has is determined by its fitness. It's fitness is determined by essentially how good it is. Nodes tend to attract links according to what is called a power law.   Blogs provide a good example of this. There are a very few very  urlLink well known blogs  that get linked by hundreds or thousands of blogs, such as several of those within my BlogRoll on the right. There are also very many blogs that are linked to by virtually no one, such as this blog. In networking terms there are a few nodes with a large majority of links, and there are many nodes with very few links. This, is the  urlLink power law .   So what does JibJab's movie have to do with this? Well there is a remarkable connection the author,  urlLink Albert-László Barabási , and his students discovered.  They discovered that networks can act just like a  urlLink Bose-Einstein condensation .  Here is a short snippet describing the condensate:   ...the condensation occurs when individual atoms meld into a "superatom" behaving as a single entity at just a few hundred billionths of a degree above absolute zero.  What was discovered while studying networks was, that if energy levels were assigned to nodes, and individual atoms were assigned to links, then:   ...in terms of the laws governing their behavior, networks and a Bose gas are identical.  Because they obey the same laws, they can both result in the same dramatic transformation into the condensate under the right conditions.  I believe, from what I understand on the subject, that that is what happened at JibJab when their "This Land" video was released.  The way the condensate happens in networks is that all the links point to the same single node, in a winner takes all fashion.  In terms of blogs, massive numbers of blogs out there all pointed to the JibJab site at once, creating the effect that everywhere seemed to point to this one site.  It took its toll on the JibJab site as well.  Completely swallowed their bandwidth.  At the time of this posting they have taken down basically everything on their site, and are using an offsite free service to host their video.  When a network condensates, it is a powerful powerful thing.  On a side note, I suspect there was condensation on some of their clothing as well when they saw the massive inflow of traffic at their site, if you know what I mean. ;)

      I've been waiting for several days for different things I've ordered online, and a whole slew came today.  It totally filled up my mailbox (and it's a rather big box).  I got:  3 GameCube controllers ~ For the gathering I am going to in a few weeks. 4 CliffNotes books ~ To assist in my attempts to be a tutor. 1 National Geographic Magazine ~ Wooyeah! 1 Vehicle registration form ~ Ok, have to pay for this one, so it's not all good.  Overall, that's a pretty good haul if I do say so myself.  Much fun to be had.  Best of all, one of the Cliff Notes books is on economics... I've never actually taken any classes above the very basics, so it should be helpful.

      Ok, this is something that has bothered me with movie makers for a while.&nbsp; Why do writers feel the need to cram an irrelevant love story into a perfectly good movie?&nbsp; Shamefully, I can't think of any specific examples at the moment, but you know what I am talking about, right?   Movies, that have their own story, then tacked onto is a totally irrelevant love story subplot that has nothing to do with the main story.&nbsp; It's annoying.&nbsp; Totally ruins the experience.&nbsp;   One movie, that I only half watched, was Pearl Harbor.&nbsp; It was presented as an action movie, on the previews that I saw.&nbsp; But the movie itself seemed to be some sort of love triangle thing, with the story of the battle being the irrelevant subplot.&nbsp; I don't really like Ben Affleck though, so maybe that's it.&nbsp; Another example I was just handed was The Day After Tomorrow.&nbsp; The love interest between two students was not the best executed.&nbsp; Then again, the entire movie was poorly executed.   Some of my favorite movies have no love subplot to mess up the experience.   Shawshank Redemption  The Green Mile  Cool Runnings   All are great movies that don't need a gimmicky love story to try to attract audiences.   Now, don't misunderstand me now, I am not against love stories.&nbsp; I am against those that try to say they are one type of movie, and then not be.&nbsp; Some stories did it well.&nbsp; For example, in the Spiderman movies, Mary Jane is an integral part of the story.&nbsp; She is not just some light skirt slapped on to try to draw in a few women viewers.&nbsp; No, you take out Mary Jane, and the entire movie loses itself.&nbsp;   Another is Titanic.&nbsp; Now, it would fall into the tacky love story category if it tried to sell itself as a story about the ship's disaster.&nbsp; But instead it is honest from the get go that it is about Rose and Jack.&nbsp; With no love story in this one, and you are reduced to a documentary.   So, movie makers, listen up.&nbsp; If you have a love story, write a movie about it.&nbsp; If you have a story that isn't a love story, please, please, don't try and tack on a worthless subplot that only serves to distract from what is going on.&nbsp; We are not that stupid.

      I wrote two articles earlier,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here , about Europe's growth potential in the coming years.&nbsp; (Careful, the second one will link you to the first again, don't get lost.)&nbsp; Reading at  urlLink Marginal Revolution ,  urlLink Tyler Cowen  posted about a shift in attitudes in France.&nbsp; You will recall that changing attitudes was one of the major things I mentioned that would be needed to bring about change on the continent.   The attitude change that TC posted about was small, but it was a start.&nbsp; He linked to a  urlLink quote  that was appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally though, I like the earthquake metaphor better.&nbsp; There is a little rumbling going on in Europe, and few people are noticing it as of yet.&nbsp;  urlLink Progress  continues in Germany as well.&nbsp; With the two biggest economies in continental Europe starting to change course, others will follow.&nbsp; Especially as these two also tend to be the furthest behind of the developed economies.   All in all, I am getting very excited about the potential for progress. I am not overly sure why, as I don't live in Europe.&nbsp; Perhaps its just the potential to actually witness a major revolution in the making.&nbsp; I sure hope I don't get disappointed.

      I talked  urlLink earlier &nbsp;about Europe's potential for growth.&nbsp; One of the key things that was necessary for Europe to change direction was the need&nbsp;for more consumerism.   As I mentioned in that earlier post, I am not advocating the mindless acquisition of worthless things.&nbsp; I am talking about a ready willingness and ability to purchase the kind of things that one needs and wants.&nbsp; It is especially important that they are able to produce things locally for each other to buy.&nbsp; This does not mean protectionism, which restricts outside supply, but rather working to boost local production by itself.   On a macroeconomic scale, it is  urlLink pretty clear  that Europeans as a whole are better savers than Americans.&nbsp; That in turn makes them&nbsp;better lenders.&nbsp; What that means is that although Europeans believe they are saving their money, they are actually likely to simply be loaning it to Americans to spend.&nbsp; So why shouldn't they spend it themselves?   Is it even possible for Europeans to spend more?&nbsp; At first glance, there are a lot of things working against them.&nbsp; The culture itself seems to promote more savings, which by itself can be a good thing.&nbsp; The tax systems leave individuals with less money in their pockets, and places more decision making for what to buy in the hands of the government.&nbsp; The government, while able to sometimes get advantages due to the scale of their spending, will not be able to draw as easily on the unique contributions of smaller businesses.&nbsp; On top of all this is a significantly higher level of protectionism that helps keep prices high for even everyday goods.   I was speaking with my Swedish friend the other day, and we compared the cost of mouth wash.&nbsp; For her, it was the equivalent of $4 for 300ml.&nbsp; I took out my bottle, and had 1.5L for less than $3.&nbsp; She cried.&nbsp; Or at least whined.&nbsp; I get more than 5 times as much mouth wash for my money.&nbsp; That same situation repeats itself to varying degrees over many other products.&nbsp; It all adds up to reduce the amount of spending money that Europeans have, at least relative to Americans.   So is there any hope?&nbsp; Most definitely.&nbsp; For one, with the continuingly large current account deficit for the U.S., the dollar is under constant pressure to drop.&nbsp; Eastern Asian countries are likely to at least try to mitigate the dollar's drop relative to their currencies.&nbsp; That leaves Europe as the only place for the pressure to be released.&nbsp; Over the next several years at least I believe there will be severe upward pressure on the value of the euro, and other local currencies.   This causes two big things to happen.&nbsp; One, is bad, at least from many people's point of view.&nbsp; That is that with the euro rising, European goods get more expensive, and so exports will tend to drop.&nbsp; I suspect this will be the initial reaction to a rising euro, and the EU area will see itself back in the doldrums.&nbsp; This in turn will help to give the powers that be the people's support to change things.&nbsp; Right now, especially in France and Germany, the governments are fighting an uphill battle against the will of the people to get things done.&nbsp; Even high unemployment isn't enough to make the people willing to change.&nbsp; Another recession occurring before the recovery from the last can even materialize may be the catalyst needed however.   This brings us to the second big thing that a rising euro will cause.&nbsp; The flip side to exports becoming more expensive, is that imports become cheaper.&nbsp; As goods become cheaper, obviously people will be able to purchase more of them.&nbsp; This will also give more competition to local producers and give them the incentive to become more efficient.   A rising euro is not the only thing that can help trigger higher domestic spending (consumerism).&nbsp; The EU, for all its faults, is becoming more effective in its ability to reduce trade barriers with the rest of the world.&nbsp; Here is  urlLink one article  on the subject that shows a greater willingness on the EU's part to advance trade talks.&nbsp; Lower protectionism, means lower prices, more competition, and greater consumerism.&nbsp; That in turn will lead to more jobs and growth.   There are many pieces of the puzzle starting to align in Europe's favor.&nbsp; It will take time, but&nbsp;I believe that within the next 5 years a major revolution could grip the European continent.&nbsp; I am so confident of this, that just today I purchased shares that reflect the value of the EMU's various stock markets.&nbsp; I may be a little early to the party, but it sure will be fun to watch.

      The right one.&nbsp; If it's still broke, you should be able to tell, as the entire sidebar has been shoved down to the bottom of the page.&nbsp; It doesn't have to do with the width I have allocated to each column on the screen, as I set the main column down to just 10%, and the sidebar was still shoved down.  &nbsp;  The problem only appeared after I posted my recycling post.&nbsp; If you click on a previous post, the problem isn't there.&nbsp; So, if anyone happens to know, or even have a guess, as to what is wrong in that post (or elsewhere), please, let me know.  &nbsp;  Thanks.    Update:  It is in the post itself that is the problem, as clicking on the permalink for this particular post shows the sidebar working.&nbsp; I choose to blame Blogger's new tools they implemented.    Fixed:  Not quite sure why it messed up, but I took a look at the source code on each page, before and after it was fixed.&nbsp; The only difference I saw was a double line break after my post on the fixed version that wasn't on the broken version..&nbsp; So, if it happens again, I'll just try that to see if it fixes it.

      Huh? What the?&nbsp; I must be joking, right?&nbsp; Well, that's what I initially thought when I read  urlLink something  at the  urlLink Adam Smith Institute Blog .&nbsp; There are very good points made in the  urlLink resource  that the blog linked, however.   Some points that were made I found a little iffy.&nbsp; For example, the assertion that more fossil fuels are consumed to collect recyclable materials.&nbsp; But if people threw away recyclables then the amount of waste would be increase, resulting in more waste transportation...overall, I suspect it would be largely a wash on that front.  &nbsp;  Other points are good however.&nbsp; For example:    Recycling is a manufacturing process, so it has environmental impacts. An EPA study found more toxic materials in recycling paper processes than in virgin paper manufacturing.  And:    Using less of one resource often means using more of other resources. When the total costs of recycling and disposal are compared, on average curbside recycling is 35 to 55 percent more costly nationwide than conventional disposal.    There are also good arguments that trash isn't so bad.&nbsp; For example, we are  not  running out of landfill space.  &nbsp;   All the garbage we will generate in the next 10 centuries will require less than 35 square miles to a height of only 300 feet. While people rarely want landfills in their backyards, they can be excellent neighbors, contributing wonderful parklands to our communities. Landfills are no longer a threat to the environment or public health. State-of-the-art landfills, with redundant clay and plastic liners and leachate collection systems, have now replaced all of our previously unsafe dumps.  But what about saving resources?&nbsp; The articles make some good point about how current processes use fewer and cheaper (read: more plentiful) materials than in past years.&nbsp; Still, I find this point to be a little more questionable.&nbsp; Especially with China developing so quickly, any savings on material is going to start being more necessary.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  On the other hand again, most resources are made from renewable or nearly infinate sources.&nbsp; Glass is simply sand, which composes much of the Earth's crush.&nbsp; Plastics are a byproduct of petroleum, but even now we can start making them from plants we produce.&nbsp; And most paper apparently is made from trees that were planted specifically for the purpose of being harvested.  &nbsp;  That last statement I'd like to find some more detailed information on, especially as a very good point was made about CO2.&nbsp; Since trees absorb CO2 in their growth, recycling paper means fewer trees are harvested, and so fewer trees are planted to absorb the CO2.&nbsp; If we all threw away our newspapers, they would go to a modern landfill, permanently removing the CO2 from the air.  &nbsp;  All in all, it's an interesting concept to look at.&nbsp; The counter-intuitive nature of it means we have to look past the feel good activities, to find out what actually ends up helping the environment.&nbsp; After all, that's the whole point of recycling, isn't it?

      Plogs, are apparently a play on blogs.&nbsp; They are automatically generated (like most things at Amazon.com) based on what you have purchased in the past.&nbsp; One insightful recommendation that they gave me is:   Tuesday, June 22, 2004    urlLink My Life  was released today; We thought you'd be interested because you bought  urlLink The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality .    Well, yeah, of course.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why hadn't I ever realized how much I would enjoy the autobiography of Bill Clinton?&nbsp; After all, I enjoyed reading about quantum physics so much, and both subjects are likely equally dull and incomprehensible to most people.*&nbsp;&nbsp; I am shocked I hadn't thought of it myself.   I also love their description of a Plog:  &nbsp;    The Plog Service is a personalized blog. A blog is a straightforward and now widely adopted method of posting a reverse chronological diary on the Internet.&nbsp;  &nbsp;Your Amazon.com Plog is a diary of events that will enhance your shopping experience, helping you discover products that have just been released, track changes to your orders, and many other things. Just like a blog, your Plog is sorted in reverse chronological order. When we think we have something interesting or important to tell you, we'll post it to your Plog.   Excellent, now those people who didn't know what a blog was, and so missed the obvious connection between blog and Plog, have had their confusion completely cleared up.&nbsp;   It appears that Plogs are another absolutely brilliant addition to  urlLink Amazon.com's  site.   I addition, it appears my cynicism and sarcasm are both on the rise.    *Addendum :&nbsp; From someone who exceeds my levels of cynicism  and  sarcasm: Both are subject to debate about how realistic what they describe is.

      Twice now in the last few days I have found people who believe that there is no progress being made in Iraq, in both reconstruction and security.  I've recommended it before, and I recommend it again, read Iraqi blogs, especially  urlLink Iraq the Model .  One  urlLink post  I found at a new blog called  urlLink Common Knowledge  said:   Nothing will happen in terms of reconstruction until stability is achieved. An initial showing of force by the interim government is needed  after discussing new figures on the size of the 'insurgency'.  Yet I find  urlLink this post  over at Iraq the Model listing many various advancements in reconstruction, just within a single 1km circle.  Here are some examples of what he listed:   The first building you will see is that of the law institute for higher studies which was destroyed ... this institute was rebuilt few months later and now it functions in a way better than before and help to create a new law system that is honest and independent and to me this is another and more important addition.  [T]he publishing house that used to publish Uday’s hateful newspaper (Babil) ... we all remember how the thieves left it as mere walls with the vents missing their robbed air conditioners. Ok, what happened later; it’s working now with full power after it was reconstructed and now it’s printing Al-Sabah news paper that you buy every morning.   [O]ne of the former evil military institutes that was used to train professional butchers; it ... was robbed by some sick people who left it as ruins, and you know uncle how the American unit in charge of this area turned it into a residency for students who come from other governorates to study in Baghdad. Now they have air conditioning, hot and cold water and decent bedrooms.   I didn’t exceed an area of one kilometer-that we all see and pass by every day-in this round. I have mentioned a lot of things but I also forgot a lot more like all the schools and public clinics that were rebuilt within this area. Now, do you still have doubts about where our oil money went? And I’m not talking about the whole country here, have you asked yourselves why the exchange price is 1500 now instead of 2200 in Saddam’s days? And do you think that a 100 times raise for some employees salaries doesn’t represent a part of the money you were talking about? Don’t you notice the private businesses that are starting and those that are booming?  There is more, and I strongly suggest that people read it for themselves.    The point of that post in the Iraqi blog was not just about reconstruction advancements, but also about making it a point that it is not at all what the media wants people to believe is happening there.  He ends the post nicely:   Then I told myself: if some Iraqis, living in Iraq, watching the changes being done under their noses fail to see the truth and still depend on the media to tell them what’s going on in their own country then how can we blame people who live thousands of miles away for thinking similarly!?  Indeed, as so many people who live those thousands of miles away apparently do believe the lack of progress.  As for the security situation, check out  urlLink this post .  Or, if you prefer to have a 'real' news source,  urlLink here  is the BBC article on it.  The situation in Iraq is far from ideal, however it is equally far from the image most major media projects of it.

      Reading a title like that and you are probably wondering if I am off my rocker.  Well, if you've spent any amount of time on my blog, you know the answer to that: Yes.  But that's besides the point.  A couple of times now,  urlLink Tyler Cowen  has mentioned a book called  urlLink Growing Public  by  Peter H. Lindert.  It's apparently a historical look at government spending over the last couple centuries, and how social spending added to economic growth, as opposed to the intuitive belief that it reduced it.  This subject greatly interests me, and I have even  urlLink written upon it in the past .  While the basic concept makes sense, I still find it difficult to believe that spending on social programs has little to no negative effect on growth.  After all, a quick glance at the economic health of Europe vs. America, easily shows America far in the lead compared to the largest countries in Europe, and to the EU as a whole.  Even Europeans seem to be fully aware of this gap.  In a recent article I found, sub-titled  urlLink Who Minds the Gap?  the various leaders, while seeming to be aware of the shortfall in growth compared to the U.S., do not seem very willing to actually tackle the problems they face.     Each government awarded itself good marks for its wise and decisive policies. In fact, with the exception of Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands, (Britain was already ahead of the rest thanks to the radical Thatcher reforms of the 1980s that Labour has preserved and built upon), progress by most of the others consisted of two steps forward and two steps back. In France, "progress" has consisted rather of three steps back. Romano Prodi, the outgoing President of the European Commission who, told them to their face that he wished they would stop pretending that they are even trying to implement the Lisbon Programme.   This perspective contradicts that of Peter Lindert's book.  Unless of course it's not the social spending that is holding back Europe.  So what other problems could Europe be facing that is not directly related to social welfare?  In a book I am reading,  urlLink The Wealth and Poverty of Nations , I have gotten a better idea of the sources of growth that made the Industrial Revolution possible.  Of the several things needed for growth, a few of them seem to explain Europe's problems quite nicely.  First, the transportation infrastructure desperately needs improvement.  I read recently in the Wall Street Journal about Germany's problems with getting new Autobahns built.  The gist of the article was that the country is being bogged down in a massive number of appeals by special interests that is delaying the completion, or even the start, of roads connecting to the newest members of the EU. Since Germany is geographically the hub of most of the trade between east and west Europe, this is a major drag on the entire continent's ability to move goods freely.  The second major problem area for Europe, appears to be in its resistance to productivity gains.  I have read in multiple places that Europeans seem to view productivity as a job killer, and so believe it is logical to shun it.  Sadly, as a result the competitiveness of European businesses suffers, and so results in a net effect of having  urlLink unemployment across the Euro area at about 9% .  This is compared to well under 6% in the U.S.  The third, and largest problem area in my opinion, is a lack of consumerism in Europe.  Why is consumerism good?  First, I need to clarify what consumerism is, as it is not to be confused with materialism.  Basically, the ability of one individual to consume the product (or service) of another is consumerism.  The major difference between developed countries, and undeveloped, is that in developed countries people tend to make products for each other.  In export driven countries, the people try to make products for others to buy, usually because the people themselves cannot or will not purchase their own products.  Because there is no local demand for goods and services, then the true potential of individual workers cannot be realized.    Case in point, if people were not willing to spend their own money freely, I would not even be able to consider becoming a tutor.  Because of a consumeristic attitude, there are people who will be willing to purchase my specialized contribution to society.  It should be noted however, that I am not advocating mindless buying of 'stuff'.  That helps neither the economy nor the environment.  What I am saying is that people should be willing to spend the money that they earn wisely, instead of just defaulting to putting it in savings.  That savings tends to end up being lent to those that will spend it anyway, and perhaps not as wisely as those who decided to save it.  Fortunately there is hope for Europe.  Better transportation can be built. The per hour worker productivity in Europe is as high as, or even higher than America's. And the attitude towards consumerism has can be adjusted.  Granted, there is little motivation towards change at the moment, however that will not last forever.  There is only so much lack of progress that people will put up with until they declare that they've had enough.  It happened in the late 70's and early 80's for the U.S. and Britain.  It is only a matter of time before continental Europe gets sick and tired of its situation as well.  When it does, its potential for growth is phenomenal.

       urlLink Earlier  I reported that I was having trouble with my computer.  I figured it was just getting old, as I couldn't find anything specifically wrong with it.  Adaware: No problem.  AVG Virus Scan: No pro#%&*... system crash.  Ok, so I knew at least that it wasn't spyware.  Or so I thought.  Reading a Marketplace column in yesterday's Wall Street Journal, I found that the free spyware detectors don't always find everything.  And, more importantly, you don't need to do anything 'wrong' to get spyware anymore.  So, I took the column's advice, and looked up  urlLink Pest Patrol  on the internet.  Although their software costs about $40, they offer a free system scan.  I took them up on that, and found spyware.    The spyware had an innocent sounding enough name, which I suspect is part of its success in hiding itself: PowerReg Scheduler.  Fortunately, despite the fact that Adaware couldn't even find it, the Pest Patrol manual removal instructions were easy to follow.  Very easy.  Essentially, all I had to do, was click Start >> Programs >> StartUp >> move over to PowerReg Scheduler >> Right-Click >> Delete.  It was that easy.  Whereas previously my virus scan was crashing my computer, it now works fine.  I just finished running it a short while ago, no viruses.  I am also hoping that perhaps removing this spyware cleared up a few other problems I had been experiencing lately.  Namely, that when I close all but one IE window, that last window tends to freeze.  I will experiment later.  So, if you are having trouble, or just want to check to make sure, head over to  urlLink Pest Patrol .  But, if you have Adaware, run that first, that way all the tracking cookies are removed ahead of time, which makes it easier to sort through Pest Patrol's results to see if there are any spyware programs.

      Ok,  urlLink earlier  I posted some musings about how gravity may work.  A few problems with that idea though.  So, I pondered some more!  This stuff has its own flaws, but at least it should be interesting to think about.  Now, we know, according to quantum mechanics, that everything in the universe has a dual nature, being both particle and wave.  The wave is a probability wave that describes where an object actually is.  To visualize this, take a pebble dropped into a pond.  The point where it is dropped creates the strongest waves, which exponentially decrease (that means really, really quickly) in intensity the further from source you get.  Now, I suppose that for particles, the waves are generated continuously, describing where the particle is located.  So, we now have a continuously generated wave spreading out from the pebble point.  Let's add another pebble.  Now we have two, with their waves coming out, and overlapping.  Let's concentrate on where the waves overlap.  Just like in a  urlLink double slit experiment  the waves will add together.  As a result there will be high crests, low troughs, and flat points.  I am unsure exactly how to interpret each of these, but I got some guesses.  The crests, and perhaps troughs, are increases in the probability of the particle being at that point.  This will cause an attraction between two objects, as the points between them will be more likely to contain the particle than other points.  The flat points, and this is important, are where there is no chance for the particle to exist.  It is important, because this may change the overall probability of the particle.   Starting with the assumption (which may be wrong) that a particle's probability wave adds up to 100% when it is undisturbed, the interaction with another particle may change the overall probability of its location.  What this means, is that when disturbed by other particles, a given particle may have less than 100% chance, in total, of being in any one place.  An object therefore has the chance of  not existing at all .  Because an object may not exist at all during certain moments, it will appear to act slower than objects that appear to be disturbed less.  The higher the disturbance from other probability waves in the area, the more disruption, the there higher the probability of an object not existing at all at any given moment. This is the time dilation I was missing from my earlier musings!  This is all purely speculative of course.  I need to read up a lot more to really be able to understand and actually do calculations.  But, as I said earlier, it's interesting to think about.

      Here I was, sitting here just minding my own business, writing a blog post about Spiderman 2, which I had just seen...and my computer crashes.  Again.  That's probably the 5th time today.  The first three times were while trying to run a virus scan.  As you can probably guess, I've stopped trying to run the scan now.  The other two times were just seemingly random crashes.  Everything just locked up.  Worse of all, I had to hit the power switch on the surge protector to shut off my computer.  The stupid off button won't work if the system has crashed.  Excellent design I must say.  Make a button that only lets you turn off the computer when everything is running fine.  Sheer brilliance.  Oh, and you can't even use it for when it's time to shut down the computer, because when you exit Windows, it automatically shuts itself off.  So I have a totally worthless power button. Gah.  *Saved post as Draft*  There, now I won't have to totally start over from the beginning.  Now, where was I?  Oh yes, new computer.  So, if anyone has any suggestions about what to do, I'd love to hear them.  I've been considering building my own computer, but as I've never done it before, I am somewhat apprehensive about it.  On the other hand, I could buy another cheapo computer that will hopefully last me a few years.  This one is running right at about 3 years now.  For $400 for the tower part, I suppose that's not too shabby.  *sigh* I hate shopping.

      Need it for a gathering of people I've met online that I am attending in August.  Fair price too, only $26.65 off of  urlLink eBay .  Always a good place to get stuff cheap.  Currently am shopping around for a sleeping bag and air mattress, then I'll be all set.  I made sure to check it out, to see if everything was okay with it, as it was a used tent.  Sure enough, I got it up and stable...after a few tries.  Turns out that vacuums are a powerful source...so make sure the door is open before you try to set up a tent, otherwise you end up trying to lift the entire thing off the ground.  Live and learn.  Glad I figured that out now, before anyone is around to watch me mess around with it when I actually go camping.  Although, I use camping rather loosely, as it will just be in someone's backyard.  Yeah, I'm a wimp, but at least I'm a comfortable wimp. :P  Hmm, I need to get a camera too.  I wonder how cheap those come.  Time to search eBay some more.

      One of the spiders got a  urlLink bee .  It's just hanging there, nice and dead-like.  Poor bee.  On the flip side though, this means that spider now has nourishment, and will live longer and have lots of baby spiders.  Damn.  Stupid bee.  I think I need to write another note to myself about getting bug spray.

      This post is being written with the intent to introduce the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to those who have no experience with it, or with personality typing in general.  What the MBTI is is a classification of different ways in which people prefer to operate.  It is not a system for classifying what skills a person has.  Nor is it a means to label someone with certain traits, although within each type similar behaviors do tend to develop.  Rather, personality typing is a way of understanding people.  It is a way for those that fall into the less common groups to understand that, despite what others around them may say, they are not 'strange' or 'wrong'.  This, in fact, is one of the main reasons why I've taken the time to learn about personality types: to help people understand that there are many different ways of acting, without one way being the 'right' way.  Few people want to be told that they are defective, or that they need to be fixed.  Most people, if not convinced otherwise early in life, are happy with who they are.  I have even found one  urlLink autistic  person who seeks to inform people of how his mind works, why he acts like he does, and most importantly, to  not try to fix him .  There is nothing for people to fix, he loves how, who, and what he is.  This is not to say that some of the types do not fit into society as easily as others.  That however is due largely to the fact that the 16 types in the MBTI do not break down evenly in the population.  In fact, the single classification that provides the most communication problems, also shows the largest disproportion in how they are represented in the population.  The intuitive, global, abstract mindset comprises only about 25% of the overall population, based on  urlLink figures  I have seen, yet accounts for half of the 16 types.  The sensing, detailed, concrete mindset, makes up the other 75% of the population.  Due to this disproportionate representation, the Sensing mindset is that which tends to be considered the more 'normal'.  I have little doubt, that the majority of those diagnosed with mental 'disorders' (ADHD, for example) are simply iNtuitives living in a Sensing world.  Well intentioned parents and doctors seek to diagnose the behavior of iNtuitives as some sort of defect, and then attempt to find ways to correct it.  A quick search on the internet will find many, many opinions about the overdiagnosis of diseases such as ADHD.  This does not mean that only iNtuitives are not understood.  Any type can be made to feel an outcast when there are no others of their own type around.  Especially if raised in an environment where strict adherence to a set behavior is enforced.  What is important for people to realize is that there is no good or bad type.  There is no one way of doing things.    We live in a world where there are acceptable ways of acting, but at the same time the world is as we make it.  It will change as the people in it become aware of and respect the uniqueness of others, without trying to dictate so called proper behavior to them.  We each have our strengths and our weaknesses.  Sometimes they are one and the same.  Just as some people are socially oriented, they should not consider those who are more quiet as defective.  Those who are more decisive should not considered the patient to be less intelligent.  In both cases the tables could be turned, and in many times are.  Introverted types may view those that are extroverted as somehow defective in their constant need for attention.  Those who take their time in matters may assume that those who jump to conclusions to be the ones who are less intelligent.  Hopefully I have given those of you new to personality typing enough information not to dismiss it out of hand as being a way to put people in boxes, and rather to see it as a way to help let people be themselves.  If you want to learn more, read my  urlLink introduction to personality types , although from here on out it will steadily get more technical.  Don't worry, it still starts out easy.

      Well, the big news out today is of course that Kerry selected John Edwards as his running mate in the presidential election.  What is less apparent is the fact that it appears Robert Shrum may have played a large part in that decision.  Who?  I'd never heard of him before today either, however there was a front page article in the  WSJ  about him.  Reading the article, along with another  urlLink article  that Google found for me, and I've discovered this guy is shaping up to be the Democratic equivalent to Karl Rove.  From the WSJ article:   Officially, Mr. Shrum's job is to produce Mr. Kerry's campaign commercials.  But after three decades in presidential politics, where most stars burn out far more quickly, Mr. Shrum has an unusual amount of sway.  "I've been doing this longer than anybody," Mr. Shrum says.  Aside from Mr. Kerry himself, no one person will have more influence on the Democratic ticket's message between now and election Day.  That influence also apparently includes the choice of who is on the ticket.  Shrum has a long history as a populist figure, and has developed many connections within the party as a result.  He was a speech writer for Edward Kennedy's campaign against Carter in 1980, he created the ads for Richard Gephardt's primary campaign in '88, and was a consultant to Al Gore in 2000.    My initial impression of Edwards was that he was too populist for me.  Reading a post, with multiple links, at  urlLink Marginal Revolution  didn't improve my opinion either.  Frankly I find populism in general distasteful.  The old Slate article I stumbled upon summed up my opinion of it nicely:   Populism is one of the more romantic and less admirable American political traditions. It purports to represent the interests of the little guy-the people, not the powerful, to use the Shrum-Gore bumper sticker-but more often than not it has manifested itself as a witlessly reactionary bundle of prejudices: nativist, protectionist, isolationist, and paranoid. The central assumption is that the little guy is so aggrieved that he can only be roused to citizenship by an appeal to his basest suspicions.  All this however appears to be the hallmark of Robert Shrum.  According to the WSJ article he has strong ideological convictions that he brings with him and was apparently a principle architect of Al Gore's people vs the powerful rhetoric.  Which explains why he helped to pick John Edwards, who ran a rather populist campaign himself during the primary.  It remains to be seen however how much overall influence the populism has on Kerry's campaign and potential presidency.  Regardless of that however, if Kerry wins, I suspect Robert Shrum will become as well known, and as hated by Republicans, and Karl Rove is by Democrats now.

      Any grammar Nazi's that visit my blog will likely have noticed this.  I've been using it's wrong.  Silly me thought it was always possessive, like:  The man's dog. The dog's bone. It's whiteness.  But noooo, they gotta change the rules on me.  It's: Its whiteness.  No apostrophe for possessiveness, only for the contraction of "it is."    Worst of all, my first instincts were to do it the correct way, but I kept correcting myself and going back and adding the apostrophe all the time.  Ah well.  Should be better now.  Hopefully.

      A while back I wrote  urlLink a post  introducing what personality types are.  Here I will continue the introduction, by explaining the different functions.  Be sure to read that earlier post first, if you have no background on what the four preferences are.  Each personality type breaks down into four distinct functions, based on the four preferences of that type.  What is a function?  A function is how a person interacts with the world.  It is very important not to confuse preferences and functions.  Preferences are the four letters that make up a type's name.  Functions are how those preferences combine to explain how a type, well, functions.  Each function is made up of one of choices for the middle two preferences in a personality type's call letters.  That means Sensing, iNtuition, Thinking, and Feeling.  These are represented as capital letters in the shorthand notation.  Each of these also has a lower case letter, signifying it's direction: whether that function is introverted or extroverted.  The four functions for INTPs are: Ti Ne Si Fe.  In that order, from dominant, to inferior.  Translating, they are:  introverted Thinking extroverted iNtuition introverted Sensing extroverted Feeling  Using my type as an example, you can notice a few things.  First, is that the dominant (top) function, is the same direction as my 1st preference: Introverted (I).  You will also notice that the top two functions are determined by what the middle two preferences are: iNtuition, and Thinking (N and T).  Finally, and less obvious, is the fact that as the 4th preference is Perceiving (P), that means that the 2nd Preference, iNtuition in my case, is extroverted (Ne).  If my 4th preference was Judging, then the 3rd Preference would be extroverted.  To see what happens when just the 4th preference is switched, lets look at INTJs.    Ni Te Fi Se  introverted iNtuition extroverted Thinking introverted Feeling extroverted Sensing  Again, the 1st preference is the same as the 1st function: Introversion.  This time though, as a Judging personality, the Thinking is extroverted, and as such is the 2nd function in INTJs, where the iNtuition is the primary function.    You will note that as the top two functions switched places and directions, the bottom two did as well.  This is due to the fact that the first and last function, are always from the same preference.  Either the perceiving preference, or the judging.  The middle two functions also follow this rule.  Also, you will note that the direction of the functions always alternates from one to the other as you go down the function list.  Introverted, then extroverted, then introverted, then extroverted again.  It is the opposite, but still alternating, order for those with the Extroverted preference.  Here are a few examples to see if you correctly understand how the function order is determined.  ESFJ: Fe Si Ne Ti ENTJ: Te Ni Se Fi ISTP: Ti Se Ni Fe ESFP: Se Fi Te Ni  Later, I will explain what each of those functions mean, and how they work in each type.

      Earlier I ran across an interesting  urlLink article  about the speed of light speeding up.  What was really interesting though, was where it talked about a  natural  nuclear reactor.  Yes, natural, as in occurring in nature.  I found  urlLink this  page on the internet, which did a very nice job of describing the process of what happened.  Apparently 1.8 billion years ago there was a sustained nuclear reaction in what is now Oklo, in Gabon, Africa.  They way this was discovered was due to the composition of the uranium found there.   Natural uranium is always of the same isotopic composition--99.27 percent Uranium-238, 0.72 percent of Uranium-235 and traces of Uranium-234. Only the Uranium-235 isotope can take part in the chain reactions necessary for power production or for explosions.   The uranium harvested in Oklo however, was severely depleted, compared to natural uranium, showing that it had already undergone nuclear fission.  It wasn't technologically advanced cavemen who did it though, it was bacteria.  What happened was uranium dissolved into the water of flowing streams becoming one of the many trace elements within the water.  Downstream bacteria collected and concentrated the uranium, and when the bacteria died, caused it to be deposited in significant quantities.  Eventually the quantity of uranium was large enough, that critical mass was achieved, and a nuclear reaction started.  It wasn't an explosive reaction however:   Provided that the number of neutrons produced balances those that escape, or are absorbed by other atoms, the reactor continues. This kind of reactor is not explosive; indeed it is self-regulating. The presence of water, through its ability to slow and reflect neutrons, is an essential feature of the reactor. When power output increases, water boils away and the nuclear reaction slows down. A nuclear fission reaction is a perverse kind of fire; it burns better when well watered. The Oklo reactors ran gently at the kilowatt power level for millions of years...  An interesting note is the fact that uranium cannot dissolve in water without the presence of oxygen.  This is very fortunate for the bacteria involved, for the concentration of the fissionable type of uranium when life began, and therefore before oxygen was abundant in the atmosphere, was not 0.7% of the whole, but rather 33%.  That would make for some very sparkly bacteria,  while  the bacteria was still alive.  All in all, a very interesting event.

      Many new friends.  Earlier today I found four bees, where before there had been only  urlLink one .  I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, after all, that's why they make nests, is it not?  There are also a few more visible in the central nest between my sliding glass doors.  They have not 'hatched' yet, however they are still distinguishable within the nest.  All the active bees appear to be working on the righthand nest.    I think I need some bug spray.  The handful of spiders that share the area between the doors are rather lazy.  Although I did spot one of them lunging after a bee when the bee trampled through one of the lines of it's web.  I can be patient though, as the bees have not yet reactivated the lefthand nest, which is the only one I have to deal with.  Frankly though, I'd rather have bees than spiders anyway.

      I just got my games back from my cousin who had borrowed them a while back.  One is Mario Kart: Double Dash.  It's an excellent multiplayer game, and a mediocre single player game.  Battle mode especially kicks butt.  The Grand Prix race though is what you are left with for just single player though.  In it, 16 characters, on 8 carts (paired in teams of 2) race around the various tracks to win the race.  There are usually 3 laps, and there are four tracks in a Cup.  Each race is scored based on how you placed, and then the overall score of the 4 tracks in the Cup is added together to determine who wins the trophy.  It's not simply Go-Karts though.  There are items to pick up along the way.  Actually, calling them weapons would be more accurate, although items is better as some are bonuses for your own kart.  Along every track there are masses of these item blocks, and each character gets a chance at a special item unique to them and one other character.  For example, Yoshi and Birdo are a pair, and they get eggs.  These eggs race along the track until they impact the kart ahead of them and spill 3 items onto the track.  Whenever you get hit, you spin out, or are otherwise momentarily slowed up, making it easier for those behind you to catch up and pass you.  Explosions are one of the worst things to happen to you.  Not only do you get blown high in the air, you are blown straight up, so unlike some other items you can't still move forward a bit and maintain some of your momentum.  Also, you lose any items you were holding at the time.  Generally, the game is well balanced, except for one item that I know some have complained about before.  The blue koopa shell.  This nasty little bugger is only given to players who are not in first place.  And for good reason.  This shell will fly along the track, totally avoiding anything that might stop it, and seeks out the first place player, and explodes around them.  Very annoying to have the lead, and lose it because someone behind you managed to get this item.  There is absolutely no skill involved, and except for invincibility, essentially no way to avoid it.  I realized something today while playing though that I think explains why the game designers put it in.  When you are racing, and you take first place, you are in a very very safe position.  There is no one ahead of you to lay stuff on the track to slow you down, and those behind you can do little to you after you managed to get a small lead.  Basically, if you are a good driver and manage to take first, the race is all but wrapped up.  On the other hand, if you are in any other position, you are under assault from other karts both ahead and behind you.  This is incredibly annoying, and makes it difficult to catch the first place player as all the karts further back are competing with each other, and so fall further behind the first place kart.  The blue koopa shell evens the odds a bit.  It makes it much more dangerous to be in first than it otherwise would be.  Overall, I think it is a good addition to the game.  Makes it considerably more interesting to play.  And more frustrating.  But that's what it is all about, isn't it?  I'm going to have a chance to play with a bunch of people in a couple of weeks.  Four player races is going to be loads of fun.  Can't wait.   urlLink    Blue Koopa Shell

      It seems like everything stressful in my life today is a result of a lack of direction.  A paper I am writing, my job future, even a little project for a friend I'm working on.  I know I can do whatever I need to, I just don't know  what  to do.  This paper I am writing is for a contest, with a top prize of $20,000.  Nice chunk of change, although I highly doubt mine will score high enough.  Especially where I stand now.  I managed to write a first draft...that basically said nothing.  It was too vague, and had no focus.  The topic of the paper is supposed to be related to jobs, and those lost overseas.  The papers are judged based on bring new ideas, perspectives, or judgments to the discussion.  Yet the criteria is so vague, I couldn't figure out what to write about.  I still haven't, and I've only got about 9 days left to finish a final draft.  For my job, as some of you know, I'm looking into becoming a tutor.  I'm totally clueless as to whether it will work, and how exactly it does work.  Do I put up lots of flyers?  What about pricing?  Can I charge the 'standard' rate of $20, or should I provide a discount since I don't know what the heck I'm doing?  What do I do if I get a student and know remember or understand how to do what they are working on?  Granted, I'm teaching math, and it has always been easy for me, but even with that some things have eluded me.  That is the nice thing about this blog, I don't pretend to have a main subject and so can write about whatever I want.  The lack of focus is a great plus, it fits my personality perfectly.  A lack of focus in the real world is less than ideal.  Sometimes I wish I just had someone to point me in a direction and say "Do this", and then I will attack it, and do it.  I can do almost anything I set my mind to.  It's not arrogance, but rather simple fact.  I was one of those annoying kids in school that got good grades without even trying.  It's the setting one's mind to something that is the problem.  I remarked to someone not long ago that the fact that I never had to work very hard in school made me lazy and unambitious.  I think it is finally starting to catch up with me.    Time to focus on a direction.  I'll start tomorrow.  Or maybe Monday.  Eventually at least.

      It is practically accepted fact to most people that prescription drugs are substantially cheaper in Canada than in the U.S.  What people don't know, is that generics are substantially more expensive there as well.  While searching google I found this  urlLink paper(pdf)  on the issue.  The difference in prices is stark.  The paper found that a weighted mean of the drugs surveyed were 37% more expensive in Canada than in the U.S.  Some were significantly more expensive, one over 10 times as much.  That translates to almost C$400 million in extra costs vs the U.S. prices when extrapolated across all the various generic drug purchases in Canada.  Certainly nothing to sneeze at.  So what causes this difference?  The same thing that causes lower prescription prices in Canada: price controls.  With the Canadian government (and its provinces) controlling drug prices, the price for generics is set centrally, and therefore is practically immune to reduction by competition.  This, in large part, is because instead of many manufacturers trying producing a generic after the drug's patent expires, many times only the two largest will start producing it.     While most top-selling generics are produced by several suppliers, the market for each product tends to be dominated by one or two companies. Apotex and Novopharm are the two largest generics manufacturers in Canada and account for more than half of the total Canadian generics market (in terms of both prescriptions and sales revenues). These two companies dominance of the market for many products may make it difficult for other manufacturers to compete and for new generics firms to enter the market.  Certainly not a recipe for price wars.  This makes one wonder several things.  For one, as the paper also expressed interest about, does this hold true for Europe as well?  Countries there have health care systems much more similar to Canada than the U.S.  For another, since price controls cause both lower prescription prices, and higher generic...what is the overall benefit of price controls?  While I have little doubt that when looking at prices the benefit is still there, at what cost does it come?    Definitely something that should be considered in the overall health care debate.
