      I used to write a lot in a club called spirited conversation in yahoo. Back then I used to frequent a great deal of the spiritual clubs and made some amazingly close friends. Friends that I went to visit after I finished my physics degree.  Since then (around 3 maybe 4 years ago?), I haven't written or discussed spirituality much. Which I feel is a shame as I had some of my most interesting times either just writing like this in forums or chatting online on messenger and things. Some great conversations used to crop up in which I would have to challenge everything I thought I knew.  It took a while for me to realize that what I believed, what others believed, and the truth were completely different things. I used to hold such strong beliefs, and I thought I was 'enlightened' because those beliefs didn't fit into the mold of a major religion, I felt that they had all come from experience and exploration and so were 'better' because I didn't have any 'dogma' in my life.  I fortunately had experiences that challenged my beliefs all the way to destruction and left me realizing how limited I had been in my thoughts and way of life. It was such a beautiful moment for me. It helped me look further into myself and use beliefs rather than hold them. Use beliefs to explore the universe push them to their limits and then let go of them.  I took control of my beliefs and my emotions rather than them and my ego controlling me. I found the first step in achieving this was to study my beliefs and see where they came from. I realized that they had come from my past experiences, that everything that had occurred in my life was either a process of building new beliefs or looking for experiences to validate my current beliefs.  I then looked at the experiences and asked myself how much control I had over them. I realized that I do not control things like when I broke my arm, how many brothers or sisters I have, the number of foster children that we looked after, the amount of loss that I had in my life, the beliefs of my parents and my exposure to religion. All of these things were out of my control and lead me towards certain beliefs. So my beliefs were not in my control.  I then realized that had I had slightly different experiences, for instance being brought up two doors down from where I actually lived, these kind of things can alter life dramatically (the chaos/butterfly effect).  So, since I have not had every experience that there is to have, then my beliefs are limited and out of my control. if I am to hold onto those beliefs as the truth then I am saying that my limited experiences are more valid than anyone else's limited experiences. I am saying that my beliefs are true and someone else's are false... how can this be? We are both building beliefs in the same way, and limiting ourselves by holding onto them.  I realized that since I did not choose my beliefs, that they are the sum of my limited experiences, why hold onto them as the truth. Why fight to say they are correct and someone else's are wrong? I saw that holding strongly to beliefs limited my perspective, coloured my view of the world. Letting go of that allowed me to see more clearly than I could before, my beliefs had been distracting me from what is actually out there.   Having beliefs and holding them about things that I had no control over gave away too much control of myself to the world, limited to me reactions, based on my beliefs, to occurrences around me. Instead of allowing me to experience what is occurring around me without first filtering it through my perspective and judging it. Experiencing became bliss and I began to understand the infinite possibilities out there.  that's enough for today, I'll hopefully get into my thoughts on truth and maybe some 'spiritual relativity'. its great to have a place to keep track of my thoughts and just let rip again

      This is new uncharted territory for me. I tend not to write a diary, or put my thoughts on paper. But I figured now is a good time to start and why not do it in public?  I guess this could be considered my new way of procrastinating over work. Right now, I am supposed to be fixing our invoicing system that I built. But I tend to find excitement in the starting of a project, in the possibilities and potential that it has, rather than fixing the bugs that occur afterwards.  It gets pretty tedious, but it has to be done I suppose.  So, what can you look forward to in my up and coming entries?  my thoughts tend to be on spirituality and business. I like to get my teeth stuck into a good problem too, be it technical (i.e. programming) or personal and I tend to have a few of both types.
