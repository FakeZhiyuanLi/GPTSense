      She came into my life as a wish  Full of life and grace  Her skin so warm and soft  My first child   Little steps and giggles  My first child stole my heart  Dark eyes full of merriment  And the wisdom of eons   My first child grew  Tender and lean  Full of promise and hope  Yet...   She became dissatisfied  Time has a funny way of...  Taking away the laughter  Replacing bright...  With dimness and disillusion   But my first child shone  Even more...  Giving her even greater beauty  In her abandonment   Left in her blaze  I am better for have knowing  This place in me is fulfilled  Yet no one can replace, the first child

      Blowing, blowing in my face, the wind.  A cold companion on a dark winter's night.  I heard the wind speak my name. Snickering, it kept repeating this: "I am of all things and none."  To show me what he meant he showed me the sight of:      A prowler in the shadows...      An owl hooting at no one in particular...      A mouse gathering wood for it's hovel...      A vagrant in search of a home and food...      A madman in need of blood...      "But you cannot be all these things," I said fearfully.  "Not literary, but I am just the same."  "I am a part of each mentality."  "I am Father and Mother to all these things, and I am of them," says the voice.      "The prowler heard me say, Look and you will possess."  "The wise old owl told me to be gone." "Because he knows who I am." "The mouse loves mischief and takes my advise regularly."  "The vagrant knows my voice but has left this physical plane."  "The master of masquerade, the madman has excepted me as his total ruler and obeys my every whim."         "Who are you," I question him.  "Let me finish first."  "Here is the riddle."  "I can be breezy and warm, yet on most nights icy, cold and unyielding."  "All have seen and known me."  "I am as changing as the wind."  "I can be as loving as a mother with her child, yet as cruel as a stinging slap of an estranged lover," the voice says.        "You must choose," he says his voice echoing in the seemingly endless night. "I will choose the path of the owl," I say.  "I will not obey or be defeated by your might, but I shall remain neutral." "Your choice, but remember hunter by night, hermit by day, and knowing by twilight," the voice replies indifferently.            "I see."  "You are all, but you are none."  "You are strong, but you are weak."  "Now, I know so I do not fear."  "I am the hermit, so I hide."  "But I do not want."  "I am the hunter, so I have need of you all," I intone.  "You are Desire." "Yes," says the voice.

      You call us Black Americans, yet in your conscience you still say, "Nigger" and out loud you say, "You people."  You call me brother, yet you mean minority not majority.  You say that you don't want to offend, but we are always being compared to homosexuals as if being born black is the lifestyle of choice.  You say there is justification but you steadily mow us down with insults and innuendos.      You say you don't understand us, yet you don't want to take the time and stop and look around.  So, how can you truly know us?  You say,"let's be friends," yet you only seek to control.  You say you don't like Blacks who try to give more pride to their people, yet have you seen our history?  It is one of whips and chains, displacement and removal.      You say that you want us to prosper in the world, yet you constantly say, "Stay in your place, Oreo."  You say we are welcomed to any place that you are, yet upon entering,"Why do you give us the cold stare?"         You say that statistics state we are irresponsible and unintelligent.   But Blacks have worked long and strove for goals that were unobtainable and dreamed of a new day. You say that we are dangerous, but who kills millions for money and greed?  You say you've changed but there is still residue.

      Listless eyes covered in rust. Skin like faded paper. Dry lips stretching over yellowed ivory. No matter, they still want me.  Because, I have... An addictive personality. A certain flair for dress. A business that never goes bankrupt.  I go from door to door. I never have to knock because the keys are in the door. Each one has a word engraved on them, and they say: Lust, Domination and other...  In the shadows of entrance ways, I always stand. You'll know me by the jangle of my keys. Children sometimes mistake me for the ice cream man. Hah!  My sweets are for adults only.

      No one held my hand, Because they all said be strong, You'll one day lead another.  No one ever held my hand, Because they repeatedly told me, Strength comes in character not stamina.  No one held my hand, Because I held my head high and persevered, But underneath I lacked a bottom.  No one held my hand, Because unwonted to affection, Hidden deep insecurities laid waiting.  No one held my hand, Because no one told me a cast away in a ocean full of people, Would be open to the thunder of the multitude.  No one held my hand, Because I bit the hand that condemned, And held it at bay.  No one held my hand, Because I needed it, Now my hand is held, I hope firmly but not too tightly.

      I must scream for fear... Echoing back and forth. Exulting, releasing and keeping.  I pray no one hears... My scream's dispair, torment or sore heart. That lives inside all.  This scream has no foundation... The purpose and meaning is vast and it needs an outlet. Just at the opening of my mouth.  Anticipating and waiting for voice... Seething, tottering, squirming impatiently. Coming forth like a gyser.  Hurting the ears... Causing disharmony and a wordlessly understanding. Now part of the battle is won.

      It comes like a hot meteor crashing to the ground. Leaving the remnants scorched and blacken. Never the same once touched. A charred darkened pit that contaminates the land. Causing dissension and confusion.  Affecting everything in it's path. Burning them to the core, till they cease to be but dust. A scattering for the four winds that is always continuous. North, south, east and west down tumbles the dust like a tornado. Everyone uprooted; everyone changed.

      Winters wind freezing my tears to my face.  Running, looking for someone, anyone to guide me.  The more I cry, the cloudier my vision becomes with frozen tears matting my eyelashes.  My stumbling and wretched cold body is unable to make heat.  Leaving my bones numb, but my mind is racing in panic.      No need to shout, there's no one out here within earshot.  Slowly, so slowly I walk now.  All hope is gone.  All my fright is evaporating.  Nothing is left but a vast emptiness that is quickly filling with snowflakes.  Every step I take increases the nostalgia.      My longing for sunny skies and people. Must rest, I must... Blood pumping sluggishly through my veins.  Tired dragging feet, blue icicle fingers, and my breath coming out of my mouth like smoke from a chimney. Stopping, stopping...,stopping...      I can't go on.  A white blanket covers me.  I'm comfortable, warm and secure.  Cannot wake me, I'm waiting for the summer sun to come and thaw my flesh.  As the snow melts away, I'll feel no pain or fear.  No time for that anyway.  I must cultivate my heart or with each winter, I shall reap what I sow.

      Inside my mind's eye, I see...      Hearts made of tin that are cold to the touch, but in the recesses there is a blazing inferno.  Eyes full of soot that burn for knowledge to end their suffering.  Mouths agape with scorn; wearing down mountain sides.  Waggling tongues fill my ears with hate.  Down to the pit of the decaying belly, I tumble with no one to catch me or break my fall.      At the bottom there is a fire that contains the emotions of man.  Warped faces twisted with fake feelings greet me.  Drooling lips and maniac eyes seek for me.  I try to reach out for someone familiar but all I receive is a stinging slap for my efforts.  On my back I fall, my stomach quaking causing the universe to up turn.      Running against the wind, trying to to grab my hand and yank me back into the cavernous wasteland, I try to scream.  Confusion, confusion crowding in and clouding my brain.  War and pollution racking my body with pain.  There is no escape because I am in a prison with barriers.      Death's friendly voice beckons me to join me.  Rather than let them annihilate me further, I dive into the sea to let it embrace and comfort me.  Gasping for air, I have little time to change the present."Save me!" "Save me," I shout in to their self-centered minds. But they slam their doors shut to reasoning.      "I have given you bountiful harvest."  "I have given you sunlight to warm your skin."  "I have given you water to quench your thirst."  "I have given you land upon which to live." "I have given you nature to tend to when I am not able to."      Please give me life, Quick!  Pull me out of my watery grave.  Breathe clean air into my lungs.  Warm me by the fireplace and take the chill from my body.  Feed me, so that I may supply strength to my aching muscles.  Restore me to my old glory.  Help me, so I may help you.

      Is it because I appear morally just? Don't let appearances deceive you. Just because I seem just does not make it so.  It is because I want to contribute something to the world from which... I took so long? Plans can become perverted.  Is it because I seem the Good Samaritan? You don't know why my cause or the reason that... I'm doing this.  Is it because my color looks angelic? What! Swirl too many colors together and they'll still come up black.  Color is nothing. Look a little further. Much deeper...  Is it because I appear to be the peaceholder? Do you know how much rage, I can hold without bursting? I show you a smile but inside I'm aliving volcano.  Is it because my personality gives cause for praise? Fake hearts; empty eyes. Think again.  Is it because I seem to be the faithful Christian? What is my faith, if I do not believe in really? You don't know my doubts and the misconceptions that run around in my head.  Don't call me bad by your standards. Just call me Sinner because everyone will be at sometime... Be the Transgressor.  Don't call me good by my actions. Just call me human because I didn't do anything. Give the credit to my heavenly Father.

      I used to think that time would change my perception. But I still see...Things that are wrong.  I used to see doubt, now I see with certainty. Where there was once skeletons, truth is put there to replace secrets.  I used to see shadows,now I see the hard flint of light. Where there used to be silent opinions, there is now brazen voices shouting.  I used to see warm arms coming for me, now I see a cold and uncaring door open to me.  Yet there still stands a smile, a false sense of pride.  And as I turn, the tears fall. A pieces of me flowing away.

      There was a tapping on my roof. A voice said,"Answer me for fear of Death." "For I hold the keys to life."  There was a rapping on the window sill. A voice said,"Open it for I need to give you Passion." "For I hold smoldering hot with flame in the palm of my hand your heart."  There was a knocking at my door. A voice said,"Let me in for I have your Desire." "For I hold in my jar that shines so bright is your immortal soul."  When there is a tapping, rapping, knocking or even the sound of the wind, listen carefully for an urgent message.   It might have something your need.

      One tear for a love long gone. A second tear for a mother's lost affection. A third tear for an uncertain future. A fourth tear for times of guilt. A fifth tear for things not done and still not forgotten. A sixth tear for harsh deeds not repented. A seventh tear for useless waste of time, energy, and mind.

      Professor Anderson,      Here is my thesis statement:  Therefore, the settings and the cast of  The Masque of the Red Death  are reflections of Edgar Allen Poe's past life experiences.

      I do not feel there is anything wrong with using "man" to represent all people or "he" to represent a person whose gender is unknown.  All individuals are men.  The term woman literary means "more of a man."  By using the term man does not signify that woman are less important, but man means this pertains to both parties (man and woman).  Many women feel that just by using the word man, women are inferior and subdominant.  This is not the cast, many bias individuals would have many females to believe that this is the case.  Consequently, the term "man" used to represent all people is not the correct way to describe both groups.

      I, myself have experienced being left out of a group due to language barriers.  When I was a child I moved to California from Arizona.  I was originally from a small town that attended church regularly and did not speak slang or curse.  My mother put me into the local school and I did not fit in, because I was not hip with the slang and would not curse.  As a result,I often was teased and picked on.  I really did not know what to do.  My mom and stepfather spoken english with very little slang.  On the school bus, in class or at the cafeteria, other students did not play, sit or speak to me.  This still goes on now.  I have learned though to ignore this problem better and associate with others who are more like myself.

      My favorite song to date is George Michael's "Jesus to a Child."  The lyrics are respective to the problems in relationships.  No matter what happens in a relationship,  being loved is foremost. In life we regret many choices and decisions we make, but love is a memory that will always make life richer and fulfilling.  The rhythm and music of the song soothes away harsh and lingering thoughts and calms the spirit.

      I feel that "English Only" is appropriate in a society that is predominently based on an English culture and lifestyle.  To stray from this because of population growth of other races and to promote economic capital is not right.  If every place was to be like America I would be angry and offended.  But to change America for a group of individuals who want to dominate the country is unfair to it's other citizens. Yes, I feel that Americans need to be fluent in more than just English.  The language primary spoken by United States citizens is english. It should be mandatory to learn the language to be considered a legal resident.

      I think when I hear British, Indian, South African or Australian people speak English that we speak a different dialect of the original language.  Many people say that British English is the correct and proper way to speak English.  I think the English spoken by British is better than our current english.  The english language is comprised of other terms from other languages around the world.  In my opinion, our perceptions of one another are about the same.  Both groups feel a strong afinity to our language anf oppose those are against us as an act of not being loyal to your own country.

      When I hear someone like Peter Jennings or Tom Brokaw speak, I feel drawn to their voice. Their polished and professional tones make me feel that they are knowledgeable on the topic and can properly inform me as to what side is appropriate or best.  Their verbal command and tone sets reporters apart from the average person. News people can initimidate and change the listener's perception.  A news spokesman's words alone can either annoy you or put you in awe.  I admire Tony Brown's style and genius.  But Bill O'Reilly is annoying, bias, and sometimes a little too frank on topics that are out of his scope.  Geraldo Rivera is an excellent reporter who tries to show both sides to the public with facts and lets the viewer draw his own conclusions.  Based on on how Tony Brown speaks I would say that Brown came from a wealthy middle class family whose parents both have college degrees, and a Christian background.  Bill O'Reilly is of Catholic-Irish descent.  He apparently was raised in the suburbs by iddle classed parents, and attended an eastern college.  I feel that Geraldo Rivera is from Catholic-Hispanic background. He has a world appeal to himself and probably had a passion for trying tp unearth the truth early in life.  He probably came from a middle class,two parent home with strong bonds to family and friends.

      When I was in high school taking a Spanish language course, I put about three hours a week into learning the subject.  I did not really worry if I was going to pass the class or not, because the class was fairly easy. I lived in an culturally diverse area. The Spanish language was every where. You would eventually pick up on some of the language. In class, I put in five hours a week, and in homework approximately 3-5 hours evry week.  Well, the instrument made it clear that we would learn Spanish only at an elementary level.  Meaning, we would be knowledgeable enough to order some food or ask for general directions.  My classmates and studied the textbook and practiced speaking the language outloud to one another.  This was done maybe three to four times a week.  I am rusty with my verb usage, my intonation in alright, but I can read and translate it into english fairly well.  I think that Spanish should be taught earlier in school when a student's mind is able to assimulate naturally the language.  This is usually from birth to around seven years old.
