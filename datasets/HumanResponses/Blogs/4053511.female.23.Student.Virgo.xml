      This is an interesting phenomenon that is going on.&nbsp; Does this mean that this will make rent for businesses in the downtown area cheaper?&nbsp; If so, then perhaps the City Council has achieved its goal.&nbsp; Because if rent is cheaper in the downtown area it will be easier for non-alcoholic venues/businesses to open up and perhaps bring back other business that has been recently lost.

      I forgot to grab a book before I left the house this morning, so I'm posting again.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;   I'm currently reading four books.&nbsp; I think I have adult ADD or something because I get bored with one book, either the plot line is moving too slow to retain my attention or I wanted to start something else.&nbsp; This is all pleasure reading of course, because when it comes to reading for classes, well that's like trying to stick jello to the wall somedays.&nbsp; But for those who are curious, I'm currently reading the CrimethInc. book  Days of Love, Nights of War , Samantha Powers' book  A Problem from Hell:&nbsp; American in the Age of Genocide  (which actually was a textbook for my International Ethics course last semester),&nbsp; Alexandre Dumas'  The Count of Monte Cristo  (moving way too slow right now because I'm not to the revenge parts yet.), and finally  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.&nbsp;  I've read this already but I wanted to reread it the other day, so I grabbed it off of my bookshelf and brought it to work.&nbsp; Now that I'm not supposed to be reading for class the Powers book is really good.&nbsp; I'm sure it was good when I was supposed to read it for class but again, it was the jello on the wall situation.  Actually, up until recently, I avoided anything Harry Potter and now I can't get enough HP.&nbsp; I'm a big dork, I know.&nbsp; The first step to improvement is acceptance. :)

      Absolutely nothing important. :)  I play pacman (click the link to go to the game), sometimes read a book, sometimes post things here, and every once in awhile check my email.&nbsp; My job seriously can't be beat.&nbsp; Well, maybe one where I was actually using my intelligence.&nbsp; But this job will do for now.&nbsp;   I'm currently waiting for a friend to stop by the lab with my graduation present, and I'm contemplating sending this guy I went out with a few times an email telling him he's rude, boring and (I never thought I'd say this about a guy) too mature.&nbsp; Other than the no sex and church all the time, I can see why someone would want to be a nun.&nbsp; No stupid boys to deal with....although you might have to deal with a priest having too much inappropriate time with the alter boys.&nbsp;   I'm seriously going to back to the mantra that boys are like parking spots.&nbsp; All the good ones are taken and the rest are handicapped in some way or another.  Well, enjoy the game and check out the rest of the site they have political games like the Bush Shootout, the War on Terrorism, Bush Aerobics, Kerry Workout and more!&nbsp; It seriously provides me with hours of entertainment at work.  Until next time.....

      So here's my daily dose of the  NY Times  for you. :)&nbsp;  To me the article makes perfect sense.&nbsp; I really wish that the Bush Administration would evolve back into a modern-era foreign policy as opposed to reverting to a Cold War-like policy.&nbsp; But this time instead of it being Anything But a Communist, it has become Anything But a Terrorist.&nbsp; The Cold War lasted for more than thirty years and I can only hope for the sanity of my friends affected by the military operations that this ABT approach to foreign policy changes and changes quickly.  It is a lot easier said than done however, because when Kerry is elected in November, he won't be able to just pull our troops out of where Bush put them.&nbsp; While I do not like nor agree with the fact that our troops are in Afghanistan and Iraq, the US has an obligation to fix what we truly fucked up.&nbsp; The public health structures in these two areas must be adequately supplied in order to support their citizenry.&nbsp; Otherwise, health problems could potentially become worse and in this day in age, every country needs to have an adequate public health structure to fight the AIDS epidemic.  This certainly is an interesting place to argue that feminism would be more effective than the gun-ho style of the Republican-led military but hey if it works its good enough for me.&nbsp; I think that it would do some good for some of the rightwingers to be forced to wear a Burka and be escorted by someone everywhere they went.&nbsp; And boys, you can only show the skin from your eyebrows to the bridge of your nose and from your wrists to the ends of your fingers.&nbsp; Otherwise, us women are going to pick up stones that are classified as not being so small so as to cause no damage, and not so large as to cause fatal injuries with one blow, but instead we'll find the ones that cause just enough damage and then fling them at you a few times.  You know I've always said that death would be to quick of a punishment for Osama if he is ever caught alive.&nbsp; I think that he should be forced to undergo a sex-change operation and then live under his own regime.&nbsp; Life as a woman would be an adequate hell for him.&nbsp; Oh and let's not forget to have a female circumcision after the sex change.       urlLink

       Ok...so I'm going to be a bit adventurous today and try this link thing.....we'll see how it goes.&nbsp;   The link is to an article in the NY Times about the Democratic Convention.&nbsp; As a political science student and Democrat I should probably feel the rally around the flag affect.&nbsp; But for some reason all this hoopla just makes me want to puke.&nbsp; Perhaps it is because the Dem that I would have voted for isn't receiving the nomination.&nbsp; I do, however, stand behind Sen. John Kerry and Sen. John Edwards.&nbsp; And I do not think that this makes me a lemming.  I will vote for the Democratic ticket because I believe that stem cell research should be given full reign, as opposed to being limited to the current cell strains available.&nbsp; I highly believe in a woman's right to choose.&nbsp; I feel that it is not society's place to decide who can marry and who cannot.&nbsp; Marriage is a sacrament and should not be given a definition in an Amendment to the Constitution because that would be a blatant disregard for the Free Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.&nbsp; And requiring a gay marriage to be called a civil union creates a second-class citizenry.&nbsp; Not to mention that those straight couples who are married by a Justice of the Peace, technically have civil unions and not a religiously ordained marriage.&nbsp; I believe that the Patriot Act is no different than the Sedition Acts of the early US, which were subsequently ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.&nbsp; I worry that Justice Stevens, the most liberal justice on the Supreme Court will retire and be replaced by a conservative.  For these reasons and others I will vote for the Kerry-Edwards ticket in November.&nbsp; I will certainly be glued to my TV that night hoping that I do not have to find a way to move to England to avoid 4 more years of the Shrub.

      Up until yesterday I was in a funk.&nbsp; I was super-irritable and on the verge of depression.&nbsp; I'm not exactly what changed things.&nbsp; Whether it was the support I felt from a close friend or the beautiful day or if it was the fact that I got paid to run errands for almost two hours yesterday, I couldn't tell you.&nbsp; It could even perhaps be that the roommate that is a hellish bitch is moving out all of her stuff tonight and tonight will be her last night at the apartment.&nbsp;   And this morning, I did one of my favorite things.....I went shopping for presents.&nbsp; My friend L. is getting her&nbsp;Masters this Friday and I picked up a gift for her.&nbsp; Like most girls, I love shopping but its the most rewarding when I'm shopping for gifts for other people.&nbsp; I just imagine what their reaction would be to whatever it is that I'm buying and that is more satisfying than blowing hundreds of dollars on new shoes.&nbsp; And I love shopping in advance.&nbsp; I haven't yet found the perfect gift for my mothers birthday in about a week but I have found the perfect gift for a very cute and devilish little girl, whose birthday is in September.&nbsp; Her mother, and one of my best friends, will be pleased that this gift makes no noise on its own. :)&nbsp;   For this reason, shopping for others is therapy for me.&nbsp; It soothes away problems.&nbsp; I know to some this may seem awfully strange.&nbsp; But I believe that the most infectious thing on Earth is a smile.&nbsp; And if I can make someone smile or even make their day, others that I do not even know may be positively affected by my act of kindness.

       Since graduation in May, things have been changing like wildfire.&nbsp; Friends have and continue to move away to start new jobs in the adult world.&nbsp; Some are staying around to continue on in the last playground of life called college.&nbsp; I've been getting ready to start in a new program.&nbsp; Which in all honesty, makes me nervous.&nbsp; It was nothing to change from pre-med to political science, because I wasn't really specializing in anything.&nbsp; But now by going down this direction in the fork in the road of life, I worry that I'm shutting out the other opportunities that do not branch off of this.&nbsp; But at the same time I see so many fresh opportunities that can arise if I do well in the next year.&nbsp;    I suppose I look at my time in college as an entity similar to the life of a phoenix.&nbsp; The birth of something new out of the ashes of the old.&nbsp; My undergrad years were not as spectacular as I would have liked.&nbsp; They were filled with great times with friends but also setbacks.&nbsp; Which added fuel to my fire during my last year and a half.&nbsp; I had an amazing drive to be better than I had ever been.&nbsp; My one goal was to do well enough in my courses to make the Dean's List.&nbsp; I finally acheived that goal in my last semester by earning a 3.8 GPA.&nbsp; My drive to improve myself has not disappated.&nbsp; I feel that I am up to the challege of graduate courses.&nbsp; My goal for this rapidly approaching academic year is to make at least the Dean's List.&nbsp;   During the next few months I will decide what direction my life will take me.&nbsp; If I can acheive my academic goals, life may take me to John's Hopkins or Columbia University.&nbsp; Or I may decide to continue my studies at the University of Iowa.&nbsp; But only time will tell.   But I'm starting anew, with a clean slate.&nbsp; New life path, new attitude and approach to the hiccups along the way.&nbsp; I know that I am a woman with a inner strength and a strong sense of who I am and where I want to go in life.&nbsp; I must learn to look within myself and find my own ray of light because my life will shine only as bright as I make of it.

      Today, I've been busy trying to complete research for a political science professor.  right now, I just really needed a break from it all.  I can't take the boredom of it all.  But it needs to get done because I told this professor that I would do it over the summer.  I had planned to have it all complete by the end of June.  But friends coming back into my hometown and planned roadtrips kept me busy until the middle to end of July.  Procrastination is a bitch.   On a different note, I'm loving the weather here.  Its almost as if the dog days of summer have been skipped.  As fall is my favorite season, I can't really complain about anything.  (Although today its raining, but hey its not humid or the "Don't touch me" weather.)  I'm hoping that we have an indian summer until mid-October.  That would be awesome.  Especially on the football weekends.  Ok....back to effectively working boredom......

      Last night, I was brainwashing myself with cable tv.  For no apparent reason, I stopped the channel on HBO and watched Dave Chapelle's stand up routine.  And one of the jokes that he made has had me thinking ever since.  The joke was about girls getting pissed when they are called whores because of the way they are dressed.  The punchline was that well if a guy is dressed up as a cop, on the side of the street most people would, I presume, guess that the guy actually IS a cop.  This is so very prevalent in Iowa City.  Not so much now because school is out of session, but give it a few weeks when the underagers and those who still lack the courage to dress with elegance instead of wearing clothes the size of band aides return to the downtown scene.  Women everywhere are dressing with less and less.  And at the same time they complain that they are treated as a piece of meat when they are out at clubs.  Yes, it is nice to be looked at by the opposite sex (or whichever sex you are attracted to).  But I feel, and always have felt, that it is far better to be looked at with interest than with lust.  Perhaps this is why I'm so sick of the bar scene here in IC.  Too many retarded boys that think more with what's in their jock strap than in that lump three feet above their ass.  It really makes me wonder how the human race manages to reproduce so well when so many men think like this.  But then again, the women do not help the situation.  They shop at stores where the clothes are made out of material thinner than cheesecloth.  And the hemlines are so short that a girl cannot bend over to pick something up off the floor without showing more than she should.   I say "they" because I know women who do not aspire to look nor act like this, and that group includes myself.  (I also recognize that there are men, however small in number, do think more with their head and their heart than with their penis.)  Until a year or so ago, I would have changed so much about my body.  Bigger chest, flatter abs, smaller caboose, and slimmer thighs.  Now, I've learned to embrace my curves.  I am trying to eat better and once I get my financial aid refund check from the university, I'll be joining a local gym.  But I do not want to change almost everything, in fact the only thing I'd even remotely consider now would be getting a bigger chest.  I digress but basically all I want is to have a more healthy lifestyle.  I just wish for the return of the days when women like Marilyn Monroe were what defined sexy, sensual, and beautiful.  Marilyn Monroe was around a size 14 and today that's only good enough to be considered plus size.  Marilyn exudes classic and timeless beauty.  For crying out loud she is the epitomy of a pin-up girl.  She was sexy, but she wasn't looked at as a dime-bag whore working the streets.

      Well, this past Tuesday I traveled to Dubuque, IA for a Kerry Rally.  I had never seen Kerry speak and I figured that I'd get the rally around the flag feeling and want to vote for him.  Well, needless to say after standing on my feet for 5 hours straight and listening to the same six songs over and over inbetween the speakers......the Kerry people still have some convincing to do.   If the event would have run more smoothly instead of at least a 15 to 20 minute interval inbetween each speaker it would have been fabulous.  It was held in the Five Flags Civic Center in downtown Dubuque.  It holds a huge amount of people.  But there were so many people that were trying to get into the event that the fire marshall had to cut off the number of people coming in.   Dave Grohl from the Foo Fighters also gave a mini-concert for free.  He had heard that the Bush campaign was using a few of his songs at their rallies and decided to come and play his songs where they belonged.  So that part was pretty cool.  When Kerry finally came out to speak it was ok.  I'm still not convinced that he is the man for the job.  I'm not sure what they could do or say that would make me think that he is suitable to serve as President of the United States.   To be brutally honest, even though I graduated with a BA in Political Science, I really cannot wait for all of this election crap to be over.  Then, I may or may not look for a different country of residence.  But regardless of the outcome, I already have plans to be very hungover on the 3rd of November.

      My roommate Kris and I have had a year to get used to the way that we live.  Since my cousin moved out a week ago, Kym has moved in.  Don't get me wrong its absolutely fabulous that Kym has moved in and Missy has moved out.  But I can say without a doubt that Kris and I have very ruffled feathers right now.  Kym has been very slow to unpack, but she hasn't been busy with work or getting ready for law school.  So Kris and I have been quietly grouchy.  I realize that with a new roommate that will certainly ruffle our feathers from what we are used to.  But that doesn't mean that I'm not worried about the year to come.  So far things have not gotten as bad as they were when I lived in Mayflower with a friend who never picked up after herself, and I will blow up if it ever does get that bad.  But I have talked to Kym a few times about things so I'm hoping that things will calm down.  Kris and I are also worried about losing our time to ourselves because Kym is a very social person.  Which is wonderful when you want to go have fun somewhere, throw a dinner party or something like that.  But Kris and I also love to spend time by ourselves in our bedrooms and just shut the world out.  I'm not sure if Kym will understand.  But I can't say that I got it right away.  Because around this time last year I was worried that I was a leper because Kris and Missy would spend a good deal of time in their rooms instead of in the living room and ktichen.  It took me a little bit to understand that this wasn't because they didn't like hanging out with me but it was more that they just wanted time to themselves.  I think that one thing that we need to do is sit down all together and talk about things and set guidelines and just try to understand where we all are coming from on the different issues.  This afternoon I finally got the cable internet back up and running at our apartment so I'm sure I'll be online more and I'll be able to post here more often too.
