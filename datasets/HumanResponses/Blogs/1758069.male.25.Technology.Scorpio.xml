      i may become a mormon so that i can marry both neko case and tanya donelly, you know...since my religion (ha!) is the only thing preventing that from happening.  neko would make breakfast for me every day while singing a nice folky folgers-commercial-esque morning ease-you-into-waking-up song while tanya goes for a walk to retrieve the paper.  she would, of course, have to divorce that guy she's married to at present, but that's easy enough.  they could sing to me all day and i could share my opinions of their compositions.  our house would have no television; very few electronic devices of any kind, in fact.  probably several plants.  and indoor hammocks.  it would be nice to have six or so random children dancing around and laughing while the music streamed.  they would have to leave at my whim though.  i could accompany k and t on drums and perhaps get a whimsical set of bongos.  i don't know how a bongo set becomes whimsical, but i'm sure my lady loves are privy.  kristen hersch, and perhaps kim deal (but not kelly) may stop in now and then just to turn out the jams.  that would be beautiful.    album of the day:   urlLink    the new pornographers        electric version   a worthy follow-up to  mass romantic  (which i also highly recommend).  songs are infectious, lyrics are ecclectic and the riffs are hyper-catchy.    urlLink download the album free!!!

      the family is in town this weekend, as i've mentioned earlier, and this evening we went out to dinner.  i'm not extremely keen on eating in public, but a free meal is what it is.  my mother talked about this book by Jon Krakauer, and i thought the subject matter seemed familiar to me.  this is a bit about the book from  publisher's weekly:   "After graduating from Emory University in Atlanta in 1992, top student and athlete Christopher McCandless      abandoned his possessions, gave his entire $24,000 savings account to charity and hitchhiked to Alaska, where he went to live in the wilderness. Four months later, he turned up dead. His diary, letters and two notes found at a  remote campsite tell of his desperate effort to survive, apparently stranded by an injury and slowly starving. They   also reflect the posturing of a confused young man, raised in affluent Annandale, Va., who self-consciously adopted  a Tolstoyan renunciation of wealth and return to nature."  after my mother's synopsis she commented on how ridiculous and crazy this young man must have been (my other fly. members agreeing), and, despite the iminent notions i've had lately of doing something similar to the character in the story (frighteningly similar) i didn't contradict.  partly because the conversation would have been pointless, and partly because i was preoccupied with how different i am from my parents.  i love them both immensely, yet it's perplexing how i am such an anomaly in the family (as well as in any other group, more or less).    then i thought about how they still go to church every week (catholic naturally) and always try to get me to go with them (when they're in town).  of course i won't, but the difficulty lies in what to say when asked why.  i'm perfectly clear on my reasons, but revealing my justification to them may evoke doubt in their own beliefs.  i would never want to make anyone question what they steadfastly know to be true if it is good for them.  i mean who am i right?  none of this makes me very unique--who doesn't think they're completely different from their parents?  it's just nice to be able to harmonize without having to familiarize.  i'm sure they do it to me as well.  interesting subtext--the whole way home they talked about their favorite cuts of meat, i didn't realize there were so many.  wish i would have taped the conversation.     album of the day:   urlLink    marine research        sounds from the gulf stream   they aren't together anymore, but this cd is pretty obscure and should be checked out by anyone who likes rilio kiley or the cardigans and the like.

       urlLink name this movie excerpt  and win a cookie--   do i have an origianl thought in my head my bald head maybe if i were happier my hair wouldn't be falling out life is short i need to make the most of it today is the first day of the rest of my life i'm a walking cliche i really need to go to the doctor, have my leg checked, there's something wrong with one the dentist called again, i'm way overdue if i stopped putting things off i would be happier all i do is sit on my fat ass if my ass wasn't fat i would be happier i wouldn't have to wear these shirts with the tails out all the time like that's fooling anyone fatass i should start jogging again five miles a day really do it this time maybe rock climbing i need to turn my life around what do i need to do i need to fall in love  i need to have a girlfriend i need to read more, improve myself what if i learned russian or something? or took up an instrument? i could speak chinese i could be the screenwriter who speaks chinese, and plays the oboe that would be cool i should get my hair cut short stop trying to fool myself and everyone else into thinking i have a full head of hair  how pathetic is that  just be real, confident isn't that what women are attracted to? men don't have to be attractive but that's not true, especially these days almost as much pressure on men as there is on women these days why should i be made to feel i have to apologize for my existence? maybe it's my brain chemistry maybe that's what's wrong with me bad chemistry all my problems and anxiety can be reduced to a chemical imbalance or some kind of misfiring synapses i need to get help for that but i'll still be ugly though nothing's gonna change that.     album of the day:   urlLink    pinback        this is a pinback cd   granted, it is one of their older albums, however it is the soundrack of my today.  plus it's just an all-around simplistic mood......fest.

      when i am old i will dip my dentures in beer  i think tomorrow i am going to take example of a fellow blogger and try to re-invent myself.  i need to come up with some sort of schematic today, as i'm not sure exactly who i want to be and what part i may play in this crazy world.  what is known is that overhaul is necessary.  i wish i had enough money to be a kickass philanthropist.  i also wish i had something more interesting to write about for my readers (all both of them), but my life as a hermit really relegates me to musings on my own inner voice(s) and moodiness.  also my cat, whom is one of the few points of light in an otherwise dark existence that is my life.  although even she isn't really approachable at present since i had to put flea medicine on the back of her neck and it smells like a shoe.  incidentally, i'm toying with this page, and as i am new to html it may be rather cooky (moreso than usual).  bear with me (deer without me)    album of the day:      urlLink the dandy warhols    welcome to the monkey house

      harping on the negative in my life gets redundant, but at the moment downsides are very prominent in my days.  there was a job i was turned down for that only required a high school education.  my parents are in town this weekend and i'm going to have to put on a happy face to avoid useless and annoying conversations.  having to feign happiness is the worst.  i have no concrete direction right now.  all i do is download songs, pick up dishes and feed the cat.  that encompasses my entire daily routine.  i hardly even look for work anymore.  woe is me right?  i don't relish feeling sorry for myself, in fact i hate it.  sometimes it can't be helped though.    it's thundering outside.  i hope it rains hard.    album of the day:      urlLink nada surf       let go   if' you've heard the song  popular  that they put out in 1996 (class of '96 rules) you probably wrote them off forever, as i did.  this album, however, is all-around marvelous.  give it a listen.

      there was really nothing on television this evening, but even when there is supposed "quality" entertainment i can't help but think with every flick of the up/down just how inconsequential so much on tv is.  i used to rely on the news, but even now all the anchors are either so beautiful i can't remember my own name or they're too indignant with their own opinions (chirs matthews, crossfire, bill o'reilly, et. al).  i can hardly find any programming anymore that doesn't require an extreme amount of patience on my part.  the weather channel is awfully soothing sometimes.  all that said, i was watching larry king live and his guest was bill maher, who i am a huge fan of.  i get this feeling when i watch him or the daily show or left-ish shows of that nature that perhaps all is not so lost as i perceive it to be.  at the same time, it's hard to look on the positive side when being bombarded with so many assinine highlights from d.c.  it makes me want to stop thinking all together (among many, many, many other things).

      what of taking a blind chance that will more than likely affect the rest of your life.  when reviewing your past "accomplishments," and moreover the all-too-prominent indignations, what is the synergy of your life?  i think of all the decisions and actions i've made and taken and what their result is, and i would say i'm almost 90 percent utterly dissatisfied with myself.  maybe i've seen that navy commercial too many times (not old navy but the u.s. navy, although one can only take so many onslaughts of capri pants and boot-cut something-or-others)(the commercial asking if anyone would read a book about your life).  anyway, maybe radical realignment isn't such a bad idea.  no more wallowing.

      could i be so gullible as to believe in an imaginary situation in which i am welcome?  i thought about my overanalytical mind acting to my detriment, but by the same token couldn't it be overestimating other aspects of my life?  i suppose i'll have to be mindful tonight and see if i can pick up on any kind of genuine sentiment.

      sitting here drinking this raspberry green tea and it tasted too much like some freak fruit punch, which made me feel a bit too barnes-and-noble ish so i switched to mandarin.  i don't know why i should care.  i even like barnes and noble.  over the past week i honestly believe i've been averaging about 18 hours of sleep a day.  not that that's a record for me or anything, it's just noteworthy.    i had sex last weekend, and it wasn't great.  it got me to thinking that maybe i'm an asexual person.  sure, it's nice to have the closeness every now and then, but when all is said and done i just want to lay down in my bed by myself, stretch out, and fall asleep with the tv on.  that inclination, from what i've gathered over the years, isn't very conducive to what most fems like to include in their whole sexual reparte.  who knows, maybe i just haven't gotten it from the right person as of yet.  frankly miss scarlet i'm starting to not give a damn.  this all makes me out to be mr. fraternity q. buttsteak who loves them and leaves them, but really i'm not.  i'd rather have every other part of the relationship methos than the sex.  if sex were never invented i really think i'd be an entirely different person.  i should get a vasectomy and a labotomy on the same weekend.  maybe radical reconstructive surgery as well.  change my name to dirk manbuscuit.

      i just got done walking 6 miles outside in the sweltering humidity; needless to say i was soaked.  it's rather entertaining walking at night in the darkness.  sometimes i pretend i'm lou ferigno walking down a lonely road with that theme song playing in the background.  that's about as close i'll ever come in my life to conjuring a hulk metaphor.  i should also work on the webs i conjure in my own mind as to why things happen to me, or even if they happen at all.  i tend to assume the worst about certain aspects of my inter-personal relationships and it leads to nothing but mental turmoil for me.  my weekend was rather horrible, but really it didn't need to be.  it was just horrid in my head.  at any rate, the vantage point of the positive is something i've always grappled with and will more than likely continue to do, but i should try to be mindful twaaaaaa.  also, i thought it was typical of george w. to be playing golf this morning when a car bomb went off near the hotel housing the u.n. representatives in baghdad.  i think he even had to consider whether to cancel his game.  gotta love em.

      on saturday nights i sometimes get this odd caulfield-esque feeling that i want to somehow defend people's innocence, although it is not want of protection.  the notion that most people are nefarious or profane in some way doesn't sit well with me at such times.  i try to regularly remind myself of how the world, just by nature, works in sometimes horrid ways and is how it is.  perhaps i just feel that the life i want and the part i would like to play are unattainable.  i try to avoid self-pity at all costs, although it's hard to stave off, especially on these evenings when feeling especially omitted from the grand social stage.  this is all vague and somewhat jilted and more than likely unrelateable, but so am i.

      guess debauchery was last night's theme.  just some wholesome old-fashioned alcohol-induced viceral carnage and mayhem, which i do require once a week or so.  there is a possibility that there will be an encore performance tomorrow night.  what an addict i am becoming in my ripe old age.  it's nice that i'm becoming somewhat more satisfied with myself in some ways.  i don't know if that is the exact way i would describe it, but it's the best i can do at the moment.  language (words) can at times be very limiting.  i think it saddens me a little the day after being social, that i have to recoil to my little room in my little world which seems so detached from everything and everyone.  saddening and rather frustrating that i can't do much to change my present station in life until i find work.  maybe i should start peddling religious tchotchkes on the side of the road next to the watermelon and shrimp stands.  but then i'd have to start making religious tchotchkes, and i don't really want to be that guy.

      it irks me somewhat when people whom you don't know very well refer to their friends with first names as if they should mean something to you.  as in, "i'm at ben's" or "me and matt are hanging with christy".  are they trying to prove that their friends are real people?  what possible difference would it make to me what their first names are--to them, it's a guy named chris, but to me it's just "guy".  it comes across as such a pre-teen mallrat thing to do.  it could be indicative of someone's personality...i'm just not sure what it connotes.  i'll have to do some additional rumination.  bitch bitch bitch.  shootsie, here's to chaos...

      inaugural entry  perhaps out of boredom comes my mind on e-paper.  also, my ideas and thoughts really should be available to others--which is a rather moot point, since i don't think any of my small circle of acquaintences would be all that interested (some are illiterate).  yes, i think the latter reason sits better with me.  my lack of capitalization is deliberate, as are most things i write.    but enough of this self-pity.  perhaps i should elaborate on deadgayson first off.  "i love my dead gay son" is a wonderful line delivered wonderfully in the classic movie Heathers.  i rather enjoy the name, as it is my nick on a few places.

      the small 4-year old whom i pass by on my walks every day (i refer to him as chunk) threw a dirt clod at me today.  he has a rather deadly eye for a yout (what is a yout??).  anyway, throw another indignity on the pile.  i opened the windows in my room today, and not even an hour later the little teenage gangsters (ltg's) that live next door lit a fire in their backyard which yielded a wonderfully pungent smoke that infiltrated my fortess of solitude.  thus the window-opening experiment was terminated.  my cat is getting somewhat obese, and she can't go outside (the neighborhood strays chased her up a tree last time we let her out and it took 3 days to get her down), so i'm thinking of getting a harness and leash and walking her up and down the hall.  or i could buy a treadmill and "teach" her to use it.  wouldn't that be a gas.    album du jour:   urlLink   mc honky        i am the messiah     urlLink here  you can listen to "what a bringdown" which is my song of the day

      article from cnn.com:  BOSTON, Massachusetts(AP) -- The recording industry has withdrawn a lawsuit accusing a 66-year-old woman, who says she didn't even have file-sharing software, of illegally sharing hundreds of songs including rap.   The lawsuit against sculptor Sara Seabury Ward was among 261 lawsuits filed this month by the Recording Industry Association of America as part of a fight against Internet file-trading.   It accused her of illegally sharing more than 2,000 songs through the file-sharing service Kazaa, including rapper Trick Daddy's "I'm a Thug."   The industry threatened to hold her liable for up to $150,000 for each song.   But Ward's lawyer, Jeffrey Beeler wrote in a letter to industry representatives that Ward was a "computer neophyte" who never even installed file-sharing software on her computer, The Boston Globe reported Wednesday.   In fact, Ward uses a Macintosh computer at home, and Kazaa runs only on Windows-based computer programs, Beeler noted.   The case, filed in federal court in Boston, was dropped Friday.   However, RIAA lawyer Colin Zick added that "we will continue our review of the issues you raised and we reserve the right to refile the complaint against Mrs. Ward if and when circumstances warrant."   Neither Zick nor Ward immediately returned calls seeking comment Wednesday morning.     album du jour:   urlLink   rufus wainwright        want one

      perhaps i can elaborate a bit more on my anti-alcohol propaganda from yesterday.  i don't want to go into details, because frankly i'm trying to forget the ones i can remember.  just as a cautionary tale, i will say that i accidentally called my parents at 5 in the a.m. thinking i was calling a friend.  my mom answered and i demanded to know what she was doing at my friend's house, you know, since she and my dad have been going out for 26 years or so and i thought she was being unfaithful.  at any rate, i hung up on her once i realized my mistake (astounding i realized it at all).  luckily she and my dad had their moments when they were younger and were very understanding, so we just had a nice laugh about it the day after.  my only concern in getting on the wagon (or off the wagon, whichever it is) is that i'll be able to be relaxed enough to be around people without the aid of the demon liquor (and my diablo cocktails).  i know i can resist alcohol, i don't know if i can be comfortable (socially, that is).  everyone pray to their respective gods for me.    maybe i should try a different substance.  i hear wonderful things about paint thinner.    album of the day:   urlLink   zero 7        simple things   i first listened to this album a couple of years ago and didn't care for it.  then i gave it another chance today and really liked it.  go fig

      today is such a beautiful day that i almost went outside (almost).  i did, however, open the blinds in my room, which i don't believe i've done since march.  i've been thinking about doing the brian wilson stay-in-bed-forever thing, but i decided it would be a bit easier and not as detrimental to do a subdued variation.  i've been a hermit for a while, so now i'm just trying to be cool by saying i'm imitating brian wilson after-the-fact.  hindsight = 20/20  even though i'm not a smoker, i really wish i had a joint to go outside with.  the only time i enjoy it is when it's daytime, i'm alone, and i'm outside.  not a social smoker (i guess i'm anti-smocial).    album of the day:   urlLink   built to spill        keep it like a secret

      while i was walking today i saw a man and two little boys, roughly around ten years old, tooling with two small motorbikes on the side of the road.  when i passed by a second time, the two boys were lined up aside each other while the father (i'm assuming) stood 20 feet or so in front of them acting as the starting light.  the kids took off and sped down the road (sans helmets) at probably 30 miles and hour, at least.  i can understand kids wanting to do this; i'm sure it was a blast.  how could an adult, though, not only let this go on but encourage it?  shit like that really raises my blood pressure.  you would think that, given enough time, all the really ignorant ghetto cajun people will kill themselves off.    album of the day:   urlLink   lush        gala

      if anyone notices that alot of contradictory notions go through my mind quite often, please point them out when they do.  i'm more often than not self-aware and hyper-analytical as per my own thoughts, but my memory isn't what it used to be (what with all the crack smoking and drano sniffing i did back in grade school) so sometimes i get caught up with a particular emotion du jour and forget that i sang a different tune at an earlier time.  i got a call from a staffing service asking if i wanted a contract job in kingsville, texas.  the logistics of the whole thing rendered it impossible, but at least it's something of a positive affirmation (of which i get very few these days).  has anyone dabbled with friendster?  i'm not sure if it's worth signing up for.    album of the day:   urlLink   goldfrapp        black cherry

      there is an up-and-coming rem concert in new orleans, to which a local radio station is giving away tickets and back stage passes to some lucky winner.  it's ironically sad, that whoever wins will be someone who listens to the radio  all  the time, and therefore cannot possibly be a true follower of rem.  i'm sure stipe would be so impressed to meet this specimen.  can you play that's me in the corner?  i love that song!   and actually and rather conincidentally there's  a sold-out radiohead concert this week to which 96.5 is giving front row seats/back stage passes away.  the winner will probably be someone calling in because he or she abolutely loved the "so fucking special" song because it was  totally  written about them.    i have no faith in anybody these days  i walked in the rain today and it was nice.      album of the day:   urlLink   the sex pistols        never mind the bollocks

      the following is something i wrote a couple years ago wehn i was closer to alright:  there are always people telling us what we want, how they will provide it, and what we should believe.  convictions are infetious, and people can make others convinced of almost anything.  we are typically ready to believe that our ways, our beliefs, our religion, our politics are better than theirs, or that our god-given rights trump theirs or that our interests require defensive or proactive, or pre-emptive strikes against them.  ultimately, it is ideas for which people kill each other.  it is because of notions about what the others are like, or who we are, or what our interests/rights require, that we go to war, or oppress others with a good conscience, or even sometimes acquiesce in our own oppression by others.  when these beliefs involve the slumber of reason, critical awakening is the antidote.  introspection enables us to step abck, to see our perspective on a situation as possibly distorted or even blind; at the very least to see if there is argument or preferring our ways, or whether it is just subjective.  could there, though, be drawbacks to said antidote?  the area between narcisism and envy is gray, and certainly there exists some rather tumultuous overstep.   (cont'd)  there's alot more, but at present i've had too much wine and don't feel like transcribing it from my classgear notebook.  maybe i will at another date.  i can't say why i felt like bringing this up now, except that i was reading through my writing(s) and was somewhat vilified by this segment.  if anyone wants some more let me know.  this first installment is free....    album of the day:   urlLink   beulah        yoko

      out of boredom this afternoon i took my can of office depot compressed air and put the little cocktail straw attached to it in my mouth and tried breathing it in, just to see what would happen.  nothing did.  i need to get another can of air though.  it's probably a dangerous sign when life gets so monotonous that you start looking for things around the house to ingest and/or inhale.  my little cousins found half a pack of cigarettes in my desk drawer, which were leftovers from the last time i went out.  they gave me one of those child-like innocent looks and asked what i was doing with them.  i answered by asking them what they were doing scrounging around in my desk.  but the damage is done, i feel like a bad influence (although i only smoke when drinking.  i should have told them that.  it sounds much better right?).  as if i didn't have enough indignities in my life to worry about, now i'm getting them from children.    album of the day:   urlLink    hooverphonic        blue wonder power milk   they have a newer one out, but i prefer this one

      why does seemingly every person on earth feel the need to couple at a certain age?  i see person after person grow up, whether it be friends or relatives or celebrities or whoever, and like clockwork they just pair up with someone at or around a certain age.  i don't understand society's need for compulsory companionship just because it's the time to do it.  maybe people need outside validation.  there seems to be some unwritten law that you  should  be with someone and eventually get married and have babies.  i do understand the need for species perpetuation, but it gets very old very quickly when every single person you know or know of is paired off like like some prize cow.  why is the duo ideal, and why do people feel bad for the lone.  noone makes movies about some guy or girl trying to get out of being a couple (for the pure sake of being single), only getting into one (or variations upon variations thereof).  i don't know why i have this axe to grind.  really.  i'm sure there's some deep-rooted need for self-validation that's trying to come out somewhere in there, but that can be said about almost anything anyone does.  so anyway, i'm going to defiantly make efforts to be proud of being an island unto myself and try to celebrate solitude (after i buy some vaseline of course).    album of the day:   urlLink    the weakerthans        reconstruction site

      in my junk mail folder today i found a message with a subject that i thought read "she said you were the shit in bed" but it actually said "she said you were shit in bed".  talk about getting your hopes up and then taking the rug out.  and who is this "she" anyway....now i'm wrought with anxiety (moreso than usual).  my cat threw up this afternoon and i had to clean it.  that was the highlight of my day.  that, and i tried to go walking about half an hour ago but the pitt bulls that cletus and zeke and ethlene and scout (and why not, jem) keep on the corner of our block (tied to the their refrigerator) sounded a bit more awn-ry than usual so that was the end of that.  of course i told my aunt that i had a really manly injury (which i somehow sustained while  walking ...) and just couldn't persist.  and yet odd it is that i feel okay sharing it on my blog with my nearest and dearest.  i gave up on pride long ago, as anyone who knows me will attest (i guess except my aunt).    also, being monday night i realized that we are now fully into football season and i am proud to say that i have not watched a single minute.  i deduced that the only reason i became enamoured with football last year was because i enjoyed watching all the people having such a goot time and tried to live vicariously through them.  either that or all the pretty colors.  regardless, i'm making small stabs at self-improvement (i'm the tim allen of self-improvement, only i have less of an idea as to what i'm doing).    album of the day:   urlLink    kenickie        the john peel sessions

      i like monkeys  the pet store was selling them for five cents apiece.  i thought this was odd since they were normally a couple thousand.  i decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth so I bought 200 of them.  i like monkeys.  i took my 200 monkeys home.  i have a big car.  i let one of them drive.  his name was sigmund.  he was retarded.  in fact, none of them were really bright. they kept punching themselves in the genitals.  i laughed.  they punched me in the genitals.  i stopped laughing.  i herded them into my room.  they didn't adapt very well to their new environment.  they would screech and hurl themselves off the couch at high speeds and slam into the wall.  although humorous at first, the spectacle lost its novelty halfway into its third hour.  two hours later i found out why all the monkeys were so inexpensive; they all died.  no apparent reason.  they all just sort of dropped dead.  kinda like when you buy a goldfish and it dies five hours later.  god damn cheap monkeys.  i didn't know what to do.  there were 200 dead monkeys lying all over my room; on the bed, in the dresser, hanging from my bookcase.  it looked like i had 200 throw rugs.  i tried to flush one down the toilet.  it didn't work.  it got stuck.  then i had one dead, wet monkey and one hundred ninety-nine dead, dry monkeys.  i tried to pretend that they were just stuffed animals.  that worked for awhile, that is until they began to decompose.  it started to smell real bad.  i had to pee but there was a dead monkey in my toilet and i didn't want to call a plumber.   i was embarrassed.  i tried to slow down the decomposition by freezing them.  unfortunately there was only enough room for two at a time, so i had to change them every 30 seconds.  i also had to eat all the food in the freezer so it didn't go bad.  i tried to burn them, but little did i know that my bed was flammable.  i had to extinguish the fire.  then i had one dead, wet monkey in my toilet, two dead, frozen monkeys in my freezer, and one hundred ninety-seven dead, charred monkeys in a pile on my bed.  the odor wasn't improving.  i became agitated at my inability to dispose of the dead monkeys and i really had to use the bathroom.  so i went and severely beat one of the monkeys. i felt better.  i tried throwing them away but the garbage man said the city was not allowed to dispose of charred primates.  i told him i had a wet one.  he couldn't take it either.  i didn't bother asking about the frozen ones.  i finally arrived at a solution.  i gave them out as christmas gifts. my friends didn't quite know what to say.  they pretended to like them, but i could tell they were lying.  ingrates.  so i punched them in the genitals.    album of the day:   urlLink    supergrass        i should coco   really cool website

      you have to love or at least admire those women who interrupted donald rumsfeld's press conference chiding and deriding him for "a foreign policy based on lies".  and how how how about howard dean...i haven't made up my mind yet.  we are ways away.  i'm feeling very rebellious this evening, more in a byronic way though, not necessarily outwardly defiant.  even though i don't smoke i have an odd urge to light a cigarette in a starbucks (the devil).  or show up to an aa meeting with beer.  i need a hobby.    album of the day:   urlLink    black rebel motorcycle club        take them on, on your own   just as good as the first.  i have several brmc songs you can't find on cd, so if anyone wants them let me know and i'll figure something out.

      today i slumbered for an impressive 19 hours, with the aid of a few antihistamines and my sleeping mask (ny new best friend of late).  it's a rather wonderful feeling when you get the sensation that you're sinking into your bed, and have no responsibilities or any other reason to get out of it.  i did manage to get in five miles before midnight.  the moon was out in full force and really lit up everything, but not in the brain-piercing way that the fucking sun does.  goddam sun.  anyway, it was a nice night to be outside.    does anyone else think that everything that comes out of w's mouth is complete bullshit?  that's not a great question, but it just seems to me (and not just lately) that the majority of people seem to just accept whatever he says without thinking twice.  it's almost like the emperor's new clothes--he says he's done this and clearly hasn't, and says he will do this and more than likely won't (second terms are free-for-alls, so imagine what his may be like) and everyone just grins and nods along.  he's had everyone grabbing their ankles for the last few years and noone seems to care.  just my take on it.    album of the day:   urlLink    burning brides        fall of the plastic empire

      today i did avoid all tv, probably because i was rather busy.  this morning (my morning--which is roughly 1:00 in the afternoon) i sent off a few resumes to which i won't receive replies, as has been the ritual the last six months or so.  then a friend of mine came over to look up some stuff online and burn music.  i went walking this evening, and here i sit, free of television's clutches for an entire day.  i have nothing else to impart.  here's some buddhist wisdom:  when the wise person drives out heedlessness with heedfulness, having climbed the high tower of discernment, sorrow-free, he observes the sorrowing crowd--as the enlightened man, having scaled a summit, the fools on the ground below.  -Dhammapada, 2, translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu    album of the day:   urlLink    kenna        new sacred cow

      despite my efforts of late to avoid assinine television, i have occasionally given in to boredom and taken in a show or two.  i guess what they say about idleness being the devil's plaything (or something to that effect) actually has some validity to it.  so, i watched the show  newlyweds  on mtv, which is "reality" tv about the recently-betrothed nick lachey and jessica simpson.  the episode i saw this evening showcased the mrs.'s (say that a few times over) jealous nature when she witnesses hubbie nick rehearsing for a show with a handful of what can only be described as scantily-clad dance whores, who gyrate and shake their respective money-makers around him while he sings.  i suppose it's understandable that she get a tad green-eyed while taking in this spectacle, although you would think that given the fact that they are MARRIED she would have some modicum of trust in her significant other.  nonetheless, to prove to nick that she is also capable of "dropping it like it's hot" simpson goes out to purchase a nice set of lingerie to appease him.  after buying a nice bra and pair of underwear, she walks out of the store only to notice that the total cost for her apparel is a staggering $750.00.  confused and adorning a furrowed brow, blondie jessica calls nick to whine (the best term to describe it) about her blunder.  what was really priceless was the bewildering look on lachey's face and the predictable question, "didn't you look at the price tag?"  this while he is having lunch with his four hooker dance partners.  you could sense the underlying what-the-fuck-ish question going through his head as to how someone could be so ignorant.  anyway, this was one of the many jessica-simpson-esque moments that occurred during the show, which really didn't do much to re-affirm my faith in any semblance of societal acumen.  add her antics to the fact that such behavior is rewarded with 30 minutes a week on national television (not to mention all the financial benefits that come with a pop career tantamount to being a cgi special effect), and i am now back off tv.     album of the day:   urlLink    echobelly        on   i had this on earlier today and it reminded me of my senior year in high school.  god i feel old.

      I was watching a movie yesterday in which a comedian tells this story of Glenn Miller's old swing band.  Members of the band, who, stranded in the middle of a cold, wet field, instruments in hand, are trudging on their way to a gig. They see bright lights and discover a happy family inside a cozy, warm home. Mom, dad and the kids are sitting at the dinner table, happily laughing and enjoying what can only be described as a perfect family life. One musician looks at another and says "How do they live like that?"    album of the day:   urlLink    bent        programmed to love

      more and more i think i loathe the approach of the weekend.  perhaps being unemployed affords me the luxury of not having to think about resting.  my life is already fraught with mostly rest and anxiety, if you believe in harboring negatives.  saturdays for me just have such a hollow connotation for some reason, although i like saturday mornings (probably because i sleep through them).  i sleep through life, it's not relegated to saturdays.  i used to have definite, identifiable emotions that always had clinical names and symptoms. anymore though i am just constantly swept over in these odd waves of what i can only describe as lethargy. i'm just empty and vague. it's like i'm filled with this numbness that i can't identify or alleviate. every idea or thought i have just turns me off and seems very unappealing.    album of the day:   urlLink    abandoned pools        humanistic

      getting a magazine or dvd in the mail is like having a miniature christmas morning all the time.  i subscribe to two music mags and  urlLink netflix  (the dvd rental site where you pay 20 bucks a month and rent all you want--it's fabulous), plus i'm constantly buying used cd's that i shouldn't be spending money on (although i do find really good deals most of the time) so i'm frequently getting wonderful toys (jack nicholson) in the mail.  i try not to dwell upon the brick-a-brack i buy on-line at the time of purchase so i can hopefully forget that i ordered anything and thus be pleasantly surprised when it comes in. it's probably better that i am fond of surprises because i think my memory is already starting to go.

      is there any better in-house ambience music for rainy weather than  oh inverted world ....i'm sure there is, but my proclivities are rather prejudiced at the moment.  aren't i vain with my music?    i saw a wonderful segment on cnn this afternoon as a part of  crossfire , which i take in every now and then.  tucker carlson, who is the right-wing representative du jour on the show, had a sit-down with none other than britney spears herself.  they of course spoke about her mtv vma antics (she gave madonna a provocative kissy-kiss during their performance) mostly.  but carlson did manage to ask her about her opinion(s) on the iraqi situation.  surprise-surprise, she thought we should explicitly trust our president and "do whatever he says y'all" (i added the "y'all").  does anyone think she even knows where iraq is?  ohhh that's unfair, i'm sure she's very intelligent.  i hear that most people from kentwood do, in fact, know how to read and can perform all kinds of fancy new-fangled addition and some subtraction.  it was hilarious how paul begala (lefty rep of the show) ribbed tucker carlson about the interview--how he should be so proud of this monumental political coup of an interview he scored with a pop diva.  you could sense that carlson himself rather thought it was a joke as well (one of the few times i've agreed with a g.o.p. affiliate).    album of the day:   urlLink    johnny marr & the healers        boomslang   johnny marr was a member of the legendary 80's alt-rock group  the smiths .  if you haven't listened to either (my god i hope you've heard  the smiths  before) then pleasure yourself

      usually at nine p.m. on a tuesday i would be setting the vcr to record  queer eye for the straight guy  (how secure am i?) so i could watch the latest installment of  the real world , airing concurrently.  it occurred to me earlier today, though, that i spend (or waste, rather) too much time staring at programming which serves absolutely no purpose in my life. and as such, i've decided to drastically whittle down the quality time i spend with the television in favor of actually reading some of the books i have that were only initially meant to impress company (back when i had my own actual place with actual intermittent company).  of course i'm notorious for establishing and abandoning resolutions, but my intentions are in the right place.  here's hoping.    album of the day:   urlLink    guided by voices        earthquake glue   believe it or not this is around the 19'th album put out by gbv, and probably among the best of them.

      more regarding my metamorphosis:  some of my adaptations will have to occur posthumously to my tentatively scheduled switchover (next week).  obviously this isn't all going to be cut and dry (as nothing ever is, unless of course you ask a republican) and will take some fine-tuning.  also i don't think i'm going to abandon the former personality completely.  there are good aspects of my current self that i would like to retain, such as my penchant for indie and drumming and walking pensively outside.  but hopefully the frequency with which i perform these tasks will increase in my next persona.    discipline will be key.  i'm also seriously considering publishing a different blog for the new guy (as was suggested to me by  urlLink smash ).  i would still want to maintain the pcp though.  still tooling around with this idea.    album du jour:   urlLink   dandy warhols        welcome to the monkey house   this has been the album of the day before, but "i am a scientist" is my theme song of today (#5), in addition to being my entry title.  also, zia mccabe is a babe and courtney taylor-taylor is full of piss and vinegar and a pompous ass in that good way.

      when i got out of the shower earlier i was looking at myself in the condensation-laden mirror.  i was out of focus, blurry, and muttled.  i liked the way i looked.  then i wiped the moisture away and suddenly my faults were spelled out in more disappointing detail.  i think that i, phillip, work well as a general idea.  my life is good, but you have to put the qualifier "in theory" behind every adjective about it.  i am artistic "in theory", i exercise alot "in theory", i'm a cool person "in theory."  so forth and so on.    when my second persona comes into effect, sometime next week, i want to be all those things i'd like to think about myself only for real.  i don't want to just have good intentions and ideas.  i want to be the manifestation of those intentions.  i've always suffered from laziness and/or procrastination and/or stupid choices.  my other personality will do none of those things.  my new personality will have no regrets.  my new personality will seize every opportunity.  presently i am a good general idea.  i work in theory.  i want to work in detail though.  to not just  say  things about myself, but to  be  those things.  that, i think, will be the overall jist of my other persona.    album du jour:   urlLink   joy division        unknown pleasures

      there's a woman sobbing like crazy on cnn, rambling on about her house that was burned in the ca fires.  it's about the most ridiculous thing i've ever seen.  i understand the plight of having to rebuild and all, but jesus christ it's just stuff.  i can never understand people's attachment to inanimate objects.  all that should really matter are the memories, and you can never lose those (aside from senility, death, etc.).  and this woman is saying how their neighbor saved their lives by letting them know the fire was coming (*ahembullshit) and about their little cookie jar and baby's first steps and blah blah blah.  i'm not a total unsympathetic ass, i just hate it when people are so obtuse as to value things that really don't matter.  and this woman is obviously a drama queen who likes the attention.  i may burn down my house so i can be on cnn.  rumsfeld is a t-o-o-l

      i formulated this theory earlier today that trying to improve myself is at best an arduous task, and i've come to believe an utterly futile one.  therefore, i am going to give up fretting over phillip's shortcomings.  they no longer concern me.    what i intend to do, is establish another persona, another person devoid of phillip.  perhaps by acting as a totally different being i can perpetuate my initiatives of self-improvement.  i won't work on phillip anymore, i will work on this new guy, whom i have not yet given a name to.  i'll have to think of a name and more specifics.  the notion of splitting my personality is enough for now.  i just ordered a real boss mp3 player on-line and the due date for the new guy's takeover will be the day it arrives.  sometimes next week more than likely.  by then i need a definite schematic of what all this will entail.    i would greatly appreciate suggestions, for a name, habits, mentality, etc.  if i use your name you'll win a cookie.    album du jour:   urlLink   erase errata        other animals

      what a fun and hedonistic time i had thursday night, and in fact yesterday and today.  it's been a very nice birthday weekend.  i rented the second charlie's angels movie and it was fucking spectacular.  what else would you expect from a director named mc'g.  very funny stuff.  i rented the new re-enhanced version of  the exorcist  as well and was rather disappointed.  having never seen it, i thought it was supposed to be "the scariest movie ever," as it was billed, so maybe my expectations were just a bit high.  at any rate, i've seen better.  i actually sat through a six-hour  the restaurant  marathon today.  it certainly churns up bad memories of my table-waiting days.  days gratefully forgotten (i seem to have several periods in my live i consider "gratefully forgotten".  ah well).    album du jour:   urlLink   the strokes        room on fire   the first time i listened to this album i wanted to cry it was so good.  hopefully it's not one of those things that sounds spectacular the first time you hear it and then gets very old very quickly.  at the moment anyway i love it.

      is my "deadgayson" address offensive in any way?  someone mentioned to me that it may be, and if so i will change it.  i didn't think it was (it's just a great line from the movie  heathers ).  i will do anything to dissuade the tide of ignorance if the name is questionable.  is 58 degrees coat weather?    i sleps for 18 hours last night.  i did overdo it on the tylenol pm though, as i was a bit distraught and didn't feel up to the task of pandering to my own conscience.    sometimes i am very grateful for the world around me.  i thihk i may be mildly bi-polar, if varying degress of the condition do exist.  pretty soon i'll probably have type 2 diabetes as well, if i don't quit all the depression binging.  i may try to find a support group for it.  i need this to be a good week.  i'm going to try very hard to be positive and not dwell too much concerning that which i cannot change.   Desiderata  by Max Ehrmann   Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let not this blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy."    album du jour:   urlLink   appleseed cast        the end of the ring wars

      was looking at our 15-year old little teenage gangster neighbor through my bedrrom window earlier.  it was quite a scene--he was sitting in one of those cheap lawn chairs with his shirt off with all his chickens walking around him pecking at the ground.  he was smoking a cigarette and ashing into this yellow bucket they have tied to the fence, and just staring at nothing.  a penny for what was going through that troubled youth's mind.  it would have made a nice abstract black-and-white picture if i had a camera, if i could somehow have fanagled a romantic aura from this little heathen and his chickens.    those foul and their pre-dawn yodling, incidentally, are the reason i don't leave my windows open at night.  i think they have cockfights on saturday nights, so tonight i may make an exception.  also, i'm emotionally exhausted from having to deal with myself so much these days.  i don't even know what that means.  i rented this movie called  spun  that sucked.  it dealt with the lives of meth addicts/makers.  i thought it would be good since jason schwartzman was in it and  rushmore  is one of my favorite movies.  but it wasn't good.  it sucked.    album du jour:   urlLink   kitchens of distinction        the death of cool

      not sure why but i was thinking about these two girls who i went to junior high with that hung out together all the time.  their names happened to be dawn and joy.  it just occurred to me today that those are both names of dishwashing soaps.  i don't know why i think of that now, or why it never occurred to me before.  i wonder if anybody who knew me in the past ever wonders what i'm doing, or who's alive and who's not.  i just assume that at present everyone i went to school with has at least married once and shot out or fathered at least one demon spawn, if not several from different partners.  i guess i grew up around alot of sluts.  ironic that i didn't score until age 19.    i keep expecting to wake up from my days  "if you read your poetry aloud to me i'll have to show you to the door"    album du jour:   urlLink   my bloody valentine        loveless   from  urlLink "My Bloody Valentine"  by Joe McGlinchey (Jan. 1996)  It was on one late December evening in 1991 that I received my first exposure to the band My Bloody Valentine. A friend and I were watching television and flipping through various channels. We finally settled on what I believe was MTV's "120 Minutes" program. For most of the videos we saw, we weren't terribly impressed. But throughout the My Bloody Valentine video, we didn't say a word. We just sat and listened. After the video, my friend managed to state, "Wow! That was very good!" I didn't think about them for the next month and a half.   In February, back at school in Boston, I made one of my usual excursions into Tower Records. By this time, I could barely remember the name of the band. I merely thought of them as "that blissed-out band with vocals but no lyrics". I picked up their latest release, "Loveless", brought it home, and popped in my roommate's CD player. I remember that by the time I reached track #3 (a short, bizarre instrumental entitled "Touched"), my roommate, all the while in the same room, frowned and said, "What the fuck is this whale music?" I took this as a promising sign, since his musical inclinations leaned more towards the greatest hits of Night Ranger, R.E.O. Speedwagon, and Roxette. This is known in testing as good construct validity.   As I listened to "Loveless" more and more, I came to know and appreciate each track as discrete and accomodating.....

      my good friend jill from new york city is going to be in town next weekend for my birthday festivities (by "festivities" i mean the drinking of both cranberry juice  and  vodka....perhaps even together).  how fortuitous for me.  i almost went into lafayette tonight (whaaaaa?) but decided to save the funds for next week.    sometimes i hate it when movies have a profound effect on me.  not to say that i just saw a movie that had a "real" profound effect on me, but perhaps a small degree of profoundness.  especially when i'm in a quasi-pleasant mood and am then brought back to normal levels of malaise by said movie.  the universe is not well when i am almost cheery.  so, fuck you universe (what's the worst that could happen right?).    album du jour:   urlLink   mates of state        team boo

      just got my brady brock cd in the mail along with a dvd-- all the real girls --both of which i will take in and comment on later.  getting wonderful shwag in the mail always brightens up my day.  plus i think i'm going to try a different walking route, which should be more scenic and not as fraught with little teenage gangsters and traffic.  speaking of the ltg's, our neighbor was visited by the lafayette consolidated government dog catcher this morning.  their matron figure (mother superior?) was not pleased.  very entertaining for me though.  i could be watching  cops  on tv (which i never do) and then just look out my window and get the live version.  whoo-ha.  if anybody ever smiles at me again i'm going to freak out

      think i'm going to copy all my dvd's to vhs and then sell them on e-bay.  it's not that i'm hard-up for cash, just hard-up for space (i can fit 2-3 dvd's on one tape).  plus i'm trying to be as liquid as possible should the opportunity to move arise.  i always get junk mail proclaiming the wonderful world of e-bay money-making opportunities.  don't think i have the business savvy to pull something like that off, or the courageousness to be an entrepeneur.  plus i'm sure there has to be some initial investment, and i'm saving all the profits from my crank biz to buy crack.    i pawned my guitar two years ago and i'm starting to wish i hadn't.  at the time i needed the funds, but in retrospect i shouldn't have.  isn't hindsight always annoyingly 20/20.  i'm thinking about buying this $300 electronic drum set that looks really cool.  i think i have rythm and i'd like to find out for sure.  i'll probably never be able to do anything but daydream about being in a band, but it's better than daydreaming about....well...nothing.  considering starting smoking.  not sure why.  way too much caffeine this morning and got somewhat nauseous.  not to the point of regurgitation (as i rarely throw up anything), but certainly a noteworthy modicum of discomfort.  i think i've lost my taste for coffee (gasp).  i may stick with my diet coke from now on.  i'm not really a fan of drinking hot liquids anyway (tommy tell me you got that on tape!!!!).  does anyone else think that amy sederis is just uh-dorable?  i just got the first season of  strangers with candy  on dvd (and taped it).  very raunchy and wonderful stuff.    album du jour:   urlLink   dismemberment plan        change

      what does it say when the highlight of your day is getting back into bed to either take a nap or go to sleep for the night.  perhaps on a sunday it doesn't say much, as most of the working world (including some deities i'm told) rest on sunday.  even the tv doesn't comfort me on days like this, sporting (pun intended) nothing but football and baseball and golf hoop-la.  i would love to watch the televangelists but i can't get up that early.  sundays are also slow news days, so i get no assistance in that department either.    so i sleep.      album du jour:   urlLink   saturday looks good to me        all your summer songs

      over the years i think i've adopted a buddhist philosophy without ever really knowing what  buddhism entailed.  i was reading about it and it's startling how much of its ideals i already subscribe to, which is not to say i'm ready to characterize myself as a full-fledged devotee.  it has been quite a while since i had any sort of defined belief system  in my life though, and i guess i could use some universal reference points (of sorts).  plus it would give me something to check off when i'm filling out personal info on various applications/web sites besides  other .  it's funny to be able to look at any television personality and think that they like to fuck.  because you know everyone does, and you see these pristine television personalities who are always projected into your home as wholesome and upstanding and innocent.  but you know that behind every news anchor or sit-com mom or disney channel host lies a sexual pervert.  all the world's a stage.  i was trying to come up with a nice segue between buddhism and sexual perversion, but i'm at a loss.  i'm sure i could conjure something involving richard gere, but i just don't have the strength.    album du jour:   urlLink   tiger trap        tiger trap

      why is it that watching an old navy commercial makes me feel like i'm retarded, or tripping on acid or something.  very bizarre.  i had zero energy when i woke up this morning.  perhaps the weather, perhaps not.  i slept plenty last night, but i just had nothing.  so i went back to be and slept the rest of the afternoon.  i didn't even go walking.  today definitely sported a theme of fuggit.    the cat is spending the night outside it seems.  that just means i'm going to have to climb a tree or crawl under the house and get scratched up tomorrow.  at least it's something to do.      album du jour:   urlLink   brady brock        warm american sweater

      would it be considered ultra-chic to not drive a car these days?  what if i decided to just take cabs everywhere?  i think the cost would really be a washout compared with owning a car.  take into account the car note, insurance, the ever-climbing price of gas (vote against bush), maintenance, and miscellaneous court fees due to involuntary and/or voluntary vehicular manslaughter (i need to quit thinking about pedestrians in terms of their point value).  if you met someone who  could  drive but just chose not to, could that be construed as post-modern?  is post-modern even a good thing anymore?  i could chalk it up to being an eco-freak, which i'm not, but it's not an entirely non-unique (double negative day also falls on yom kipper) philosophy.  what's more it makes me sound almost deep, which i think i am although i can somehow never seem to convey.  i guess there are various rationales for cabbing that could be passable.  in the words of keanu reeves at the 2001 mtv movie awards, "i have so many questions yet so few answers."    album du jour:   urlLink   rainer maria        a better version of me

      my word tina fey is a catch.  she's married though.  maya--hot, amy poeler--hot.  i can't watch the news because the anchors are too gorgeous, now the trend is infringing on my snl ritual.  i love the jb though, always and forever.  i ditched the wedding today, which i don't think made much of a difference.  my parents said they had a fender-bender on the way back from baton rouge with an unlicensed crackhead.  quite a tale, and quite glad am i that i did not witness it first hand.  i'm not around people that often, but i'd rather be alone all day than encounter the dregs, although my ego could stand some edification through relativity now and then.  also, the preview for  scary movie 3  was just on.  i think i'm dumber than i was a few seconds ago.    album du jour:   urlLink   buzzcocks        singles going steady   i watched the movie  24 hour party people   today (fantastic) and it reminded me how much i used to love punk.  and really the buzzcocks inspired alot of my favorite bands to date (ash, idlewild, et. al. brit rock).  ostensibly the sex pistols in fact influenced the buzzcocks, but i prefer the latter.

       urlLink this is to what i refer   i must be a total poseur since i don't like sonic youth (truthfully), the velvet underground or john spencer blues explosion.  wouldn't that make me ultra-indie though, since i'm even contradicting the supposed established indie methos?  yeah, i'll just keep telling myself that.    i am proud to say, though, that i don't subscribe to rolling stone or spin.  anymore....  my cousin is getting married tomorrow in baton rouge, and i must attend.  i can't say i'm looking forward to it--i'll have to field several variations of the questions "what are you doing these days?" and/or "whare are you working?" to which i will repeat the carbon-copy answer numerous humiliating times.  although i am thinking of conjuring impressive anecdotes as to my profession (i'm an architect).  i'll probably just try to find a way to chalk it up to whimsy (i'm livin' large my nigga'.....  yeah, at my aunt's.  no, no job.  car? ummm not yet. girlfriend? no.   money?  no.  reason for living?  not really sure...)    album du jour:   urlLink   sense field        living outside   i just got this cd and it's really really good.  a pleasant surprise on an otherwise painfully regular day.

      did anyone know that there is a GOP gay group who call themselves the "log cabin republicans"?  i don't know if it's a reference to lincoln's questionable sexuality or (possibly and) just a pun.  whenever i put on clothes that i think make me presentable i always feel like a stiff breeze will make me look utterly unkempt.  my rate of decay is pretty fast in terms of going from passable to what-the-fuck.  i don't know why that is, perhaps just my body structure.  is it possible to be narcissistic and self-loathesome at the same time?  i'm thinking of getting rid of my television.  i don't know what effect it would have, although i'm hoping it will force me to read more and become more productive and perhaps creative.  maybe trying to ditch tv and alcohol in the same week isn't wise for me though.  baby steps, baby steps.    album du jour:   urlLink   stereolab        emperor tomato ketchup    stereolab to me is either hit or miss

      so i know i've been a total bastard about writing.  i was out of town, in texas of all places, which can really be confusing.  days in texas to me feel like some sort of twilight-zone story where it's daytime all the time, and days and weeks and months and years have no relevance.  it's just this blazing expansive brightness all the time.  and it occurred to me that the idea of texas is just to make everything big.  all the stores and homes are so spread out.  it takes 30 minutes to get anywhere.  it's miserable.    i did end up skipping my family thanksgiving celebration at my uncle's house.  i stayed home eating potato chips and watching a james bond marithon.  i don't even care for james bond that much, there was just nothing else on.  come to think of it i don't really like potato chips either.  and now xmas is coming and i'm not in the mood for it.  it's too much of an assault on the senses.  and i have to go back to tx on the 20th.  i get to help my father lay down plumbing for their new house.  guess how much i'm looking forward to that.  it gets harder and harder to be around my parents.  it's really draining.    album du jour:   urlLink   breakbeat era        ultra-obscene   this link takes you to the mtv.com bio about breakbeat era.  it was the best i could find.

      when i'm doing my daily walking i have all these great thoughts to write down on here,  and i try to make mental notes so i can remember them, but it's all an exercise in futility (the only real exercise i ever get).  i really wonder how many brain cells i've killed over the years from the drinking, etc.  i used to have a great memory.  speaking of drinking, i saw a commercial last night for those hangover pills that you're supposed to take before you go to bed after a drinking night, and supposedly you'll wake up hangover-free.  but the problem i see with these is trifold:  one, if i'm fucked up is there any chance i'm going to remember to take one?  two, what drunk person has such keen dexterity that they can hang on to a very small pill long enough to get it into their mouth (unless the name of the piill ends in -xycontin or -alium or -anax...)?  and three, if i took one while completely sober would i get drunk?  that last one is inane, but i needed another bullet point so i could use the word "trifold" (i also considered "three-pronged").  and i feel my opinion on this matter should count, as i am the textbook definition of "target market".  next week i will be in san antonio visiting my parents et. al. family for the thanksgiving holiday.  i think when i'm in texas i'm going to blog as a country boy.  my nom-de-plume will be bill-bob dinkford (unless someone has a better one).  i will not be listening to country music.  san antonio is really more of a salsa area anyway.  i won't listen to salsa either.    album du jour:   urlLink   medicine        her highness   this is only the second of the week.  two more up and coming.  just freaking fantastic.

      you know it's almost impossible to have an original thought these days.  everything, no matter how revolutionary or innovative you think it may be, has been done or thought of somewhere.  and in most cases many many times.  what a depressing thought.  my personality and life is just a big amalgomation of cliches.  i could do something really outlandish or extreme now and then....but someone has assuredly done it before, and probably even taken it further.    walking today i noticed that one of our neighbors has an astounding FIVE trash cans.  i really wish i had my camera with me to share this with everyone (i'm getting one soon), because their yard could not have been more strewn with garbage.  not a single one of the trash cans was even close to full capacity ( i couldn't even see garbage in a few of them, not that i stopped and made close examinations).  what a nice example to explain irony to the lower classes.  then this little kid came to show me his incredible hulk action figure.  it was kind of grotesque (and the toy was ugly too.....OH!  SNAP!  ETC.!).  i don't normally watch cartoons, but i caught  the justice league  on cartoon network last night, and there was this great line where hawk girl, mace in hand, flew at a creature to attack it and yelled "hawk girl smash!"  it made me laugh, plus it could be a good band name.    album du jour:   urlLink   snowdonnas        over now

      it is much easier to write about the negative.  no news like bad news, misery loves company, on and on.  when nothing terrible is going on all you have is the hum-drum minutia of everyday life, and it's problematic when blogging (for me anyway) because who really wants to read about a paper cut or stepping in dog shit.  my stream of consciousness (goddam james joyce) then makes me wonder whether i write for myself or the reader(s)  (a tad conceited of me to add that -s no?).  but isn't that human nature - to seek the approval of others.  maybe that's my stream of subconsciousness (suck on it joyce) rearing its ugly head.  acquiescence sucks ass (try saying "acquiescence sucks ass" out loud - it's almost pretty).    album du jour:   urlLink   laika        wherever i am i am what is missing

      it's going to rain.  i need to cut the grass (and perhaps kick ass).  i just know i'm going to step in dog shit.  probably more than once.  you'd think i'd be used to stepping in it by now.  maybe afterward i'll open mouth and insert foot....what a lovely thought.

      i received an e-card (or so i was lead to believe) from an anonymous admirer.  i have a strong hunch though that i am being romanced by a marketing company.  ah well, beggars can't be choosers (oh marketing company!  that's it marketing company!!  do it to me marketing company! yes yes yes!).

      occasionally on a quiet weekend night such as tonight i wonder how many people out there are making that double-backed beast simultaneously.  kind of a peculiar musing right?  it strikes me every now and then, and at best it's a fleeting thought (except of course when i have the inclination to write about it and immortalize it forever on a computer server somewhere).  it has no effect on my mental state either way (believe it or not).  human nature it is, yadda blah womp.  anyway, just a thought.  i hope i can see the lunar eclipse tomorrow night.  the lunars are always so much better than the solars.  i think solar eclipses are the bastards of the eclipse world.  fucking sun.    album du jour:   urlLink   enon        high society

      it's actually friday when i'm writing this...thinking of something noteworthy to mention about thursday.  i spent all day pretty much downloading hotfixes and patches and service packs for my computer that i've been putting off forever.  not sure why i was dreading it...  but it's done.    thinking about buying a digital camera.  just something cheap.  my friend just bought a webcam and i was chatting with her yesterday while looking at her simultaneously.  not a novel idea, but new to me.  i initially wanted to get one too, but then i thought, do i really want people looking at me while i'm on here.  i'd end up forgetting it was on and then molesting myself for all to see.  and that just wouldn't be good for anyone.    album du jour:   urlLink   some girls        feel it   juliana hatfield and frieda love from  urlLink the blake babies  reformed to make  urlLink some girls  with heidi glick  (bass, formerly of  urlLink the pieces ).  and if you don't know of  urlLink the blake babies , well, my god.

      while watching  rich girls  earlier on mtv (not proud of it, but at least applaud my honesty) i had a great idea for a freind of mine and i to make our own tv show called  poor old dudes .  instead of riding around in a limo, they could film us pushing his car down the road after it stalls.  and come with us to goodwill as we look for clothes that could pass for semi-new (as opposed to the 5th avenue ventures of the rich girls).  and also, instead of having our own private catered parties, we could be shown trying to get buzzed on cheap vodka before going to a no-cover bar with $1.00 bourbon (even though we sneak our own liquor in with small flasks).  or us fucked up at 3 in the morning  trying to make a meal out of whole wheat tortillas and ice cubes.  perhaps a condiment or two.  and our big drama scenes would involve us fighting over the last chalupa we saved up for from taco bell.  yeah.    album du jour:   urlLink   tahiti 80        puzzle

      what does it mean to do things in moderation.  hypothetically, if i avoided all things i considered to be exterme--the highs and lows of life--would i be happier?  i hear people all the time say that moderation is key to happiness, but isn't it all relative?  for instance, right now i either go out acting super-social and drink until i can't feel feelings, or i sit alone in my room, blinds drawn, without human contact and don't drink at all.  therein lies a high and low for me.  let's say there is someone else, a thirty-something married woman who regularly has trite dinner parties with her husband and a few other thirty-something couples on a weekly basis (they probably even have some anal rotating schedule worked out as to whose house they meet at each week).  she doesn't get too drunk, if at all, partakes in conversations about danielle steele or window treatments (which would absolutely give me a nosebleed) and goes home at 9:30 or so.  on a regular day she may have a glass or highball of something with dinner, or right after work, or whatever.  and that's it.  her high is a few drinks with friends weekly, and her low one or two daily.  what i'm thinking about in all this is whether imaginary lady dervies more overall happiness from her life of lower highs and higher lows than i do from my current existence comprised of spuradic binges of indulgence (high highs) and hibernation periods (low lows).  and really, after all is said and done and you've grown accustomed to one lifestyle or the other, isn't it all just relative good or bad?  wouldn't everything just average out?    i'm trying to contort my afforementioned lifestyle into more of a balanced one, closer to but  by no means  exactly like my example woman (i'd kill myself if i turned into a pastel asshat like that.  i could get a part on  friends  though).  i think this is what i hope to achieve by revamping my approach(es) to life and further honing of my societal acumen--happiness and/or contentment through relative moderation.  it sounds a bit drab when posed that way.  it won't be drab though because i could never tolerate being drab.  the world has enough pastel asshats drinking starbucks and shopping with an ikia catalog.    album du jour:   urlLink   the shins        chutes too narrow   this lp is almost brazen when compared with their former effort, but still great.  the first track kind of floored me actually.  bless their hearts.

      i get to go flying really early again tomorrow - 7:30 in the a.m isn't as bad as 4:30 in the a.m., but waking up early for me just sucks - no matter what you definition of "early" is.  here's mine:  early (adj.) - having to do anything prior to wanting to  flying has gotten to be such a pain in the ass, alhtough i guess it always has been.  going from lafayette to san antonio, and vice versa, is especially monotonous because the flights are so short you end up spending more time checking in and boarding and taxiing and being anally probed (although i'm sure some people like that) than you actually do in the air.  there's always a stopover either in houston or dallas, which i don't understand.  i don't even really give a shit about the security issues - anyone trying to take down a flight from dallas to lafayette would just be doing the passengers a big favor (hope i'm not done any favors tomorrow.  praise allah).  not that i don't enjoy the wonrderful aerial vantage of the scenic lake charles sulphur refineries and the sabine delta.  sometimes i like to drink beer in a skybar on the stopover, but i don't have enough time tomorrow, plus i don't really want to be that guy drinking beer before 10 a.m.  this is texas though, so maybe that's not as much of an impropriety.    album du jour:   urlLink   boss hog        whiteout

      few people realize that tenacious d actually aired first in 1997 on hbo, with the six episodes that are now on the complete masterworks dvd.  i actually watched and taped (and fully appreciated) them way back when, so i feel a bit like i got in on the gorund floor with the now-famous d.  does this make me a trend-setter?  oh yeah, definitely, without a doubt.  just to let all of you know, i've started wearing skidz again (i thought it was time for a comeback - fashion is cyclical), so if anyone want to start wearing them now and really get accolades a couple years down the road for being inventive, then by all means do as i do.

      there is this audio/video store here in san antonio call bjorn's (swedish i believe).  it is a virtual disneyland for those into home audio and video playthings.  i'm never going to be the same.  this store has 3 differen encased rooms for surround-sound system demonstrations and  3 or 4 movie theater rooms - not just living rooms with tv's in them, literally rooms that look like microcosms of movie theaters.  very similar to the ones you see in celebrities' homes on  cribs .  after seeing that i think my new mission in life is to one day own one room like that from which i will never have to leave.  also they set up an entire house (literally), with kitchen, bedroom, living room, office, the whole nine, with various sound and video schemes.  i know this all may bore many people, but i'm an audiophile so i totally creamed the jeans.  i also had to run into best buy to exchange a disfunctional xmas gift.  i always hate having to meander the hoi polloi, especially the day after the day after christmas.  a little reminder to myself why i hardly go out anymore.      album du jour:   urlLink   the rentals        return of the rentals

      yesterday for the first time in almost a decade i had a phone conversation with my older brother.  he's my half brother really, from my dad's first marriage.  he's in north carolina and apparently is in almost the exact same state of indecidion that i am, in terms of what to do with life.  we talked for a couple of hours and it seems he and i have much more in common than do my younger brother and i, which just makes me lament even more the fact that we haven't kept in touch.  it's nice to know that i'm not the only one in the family who's wracked with incertitude.  and you know, the only reason i consider myself to be unsuccessful in life up to this point is because i'm constantly comparing my crrrent situation against some judeo-christian ideal of what life should be, i.e. the job, apartment, car, financial stability, strict moral adherence, etc.  i need to start consciously changing my thought processes to exclude comparisons of such a nature.  it i took my parents' goals for me (and i have a hunch what are most people's parents' goals for them) and excluded them from self-evaluation, i really have very little i disapprove of about myself.  of course i'd also have to discredit some societal definitions of what's acceptable, as do we all, and i think i would be a much happier individual.  none of this is easy, considering my self-image is intrinsically just an amalgomation of comparisons to "norms", which are all innate in my mind, but it's a healthy step.    album du jour:   urlLink   the smiths        strangeways here we come

      my parents, aunt, and grandmother are in the living room watching a movie they have all seen several times.  this morning, being xmas and all, there were several new dvds in our stockings.  yet still they stick with the tried and true.  just goes to show how the older you get the more averse to change you are.  there's also a video rental store not 5 minutes down the road, although i'm sure it's closed.  but they still never rent anything.  only when i'm in town.    my brother and i are jockeying for time on my mom's new dell.  my father bought her a 20 inch flat screen monitor to go with it, which, in case you don't know, runs around a grand.  add that to the wireless keyboard/mouse and the fact that he more than likely bought it at retail, and good gravy.  i should start sucking up holding out for more.  i got a really cool digital camera, but it's pretty compact and i'm afraid i'm going to lose it one night while trying to take it out on the town with me to immortalize debauchery.  hey me, remind myself that's what disposables are for.  i'm going to go eat ham now.  that's not a euphemism.  sick bastards.    album du jour:   urlLink   edie brickell        volcano

      i heard on the news that the union for department store employees (apparently there is such a thing) is raising a lawsuit charging that the constant repitition of christmas music being played during employees' shifts causes mental distress (and/or duress, i don't remember exactly).  my knee-jerk reaction was to lament the fac that, once again, our judicial system allows such litigation to occur.  but then i thought about the song "rockin around the christmas tree" (by brenda lee i think), and couldnot  have been more sympathetic.  my family likes to have that elevator-background ambiance christmas music in the background of our living room/kitchen and i really can't stand it.  and mad cow disease is finally here.  i always thought the mad cow would be a terrific mascot.  all you would need for a costume would be a cow mask with some painted-on slanty eyebrows.  and get really good saying moo with attitude.    album du jour:   urlLink   komeda    the genius of

      there was a special on vh1 earlier entitled "a playa's guide to scarface," all about what our various modern hip-hop personalities find so endearing about the movie, heralding it as an archetype for their business philosophies and attitudes (if you've ever watched cribs you'll notice how many of the celebs like to pull out their  scarface  dvd during the living room tour).   they all admired tony montana's balls (metaphorically speaking), bravado, lifestyle, clothing...everything about the character.  what was funny though was that not a one mentioned the fact that tony montana ends up face down in his own bloody fountain with god knows how many rounds in his torso.  isn't it obvious to anyone else that this character is not one to be emulated?  has noone learned anything from 2pac or biggie?  the fountain he's face-down in even reads "the world is yours"!   does anyone know what hubris means?  blaring flashing neon warning signs to anyone else?  can i think of another rhetoric question?    album du jour:   urlLink   the notwist        neon golden   notwist is just some good funky jams with good basslines.  this has really suited my taste lately.  also check out  urlLink brassy

      it is colder than jesus in my room right now.  i am quite happy with it (now is the winter of my discontent!).     i'm developing this detrimental habit of sleeping from 5 or so in the evening until 11, then going back to sleep at 2, through until the afternoon, all with the aid of my wonderful friends the equate family of generic antihistamines.    everyone mark your calendars - sunday is the premiere of the e! true hollywood story on richard gere.  how could it not be entertaining.  alas poor lemmywinks, i knew him well.  maggie gyllenhall was on jon stewart yesterday.  i've always found her utterly adorable and i know why.  there's this thing that some people do when they laugh that i find very endearing, they sort of raise their forehead when they smile or laugh (if that makes sense at all), which lifts the skin in between the eyes.  i wish i had a picture of what i mean.  it's almost a look of surprised delight.  at any rate, maggie gyllenhall, in addition to being engaging and hella cute (hella? where the fuck did that come from), posesses this feature.  plus she picks some really great movies to work on, and will one day be mine.    album du jour:   urlLink   jack off jill        clear hearts grey flowers

      do people really believe that saddam hussein was one of our greatest threats?  as far as foreign dictators and the potential harm they could cause us, he was one of the lesser evils.  and now big w. will get credit, probably win another four years, and in the course of his tenure inspire thousands of once passive middle-eastern dissidents to elevate their distaste for american interference into a very active pursuit of terrorist reaction (mission accomplished!).  hussein was a tyrannical maniac, no question, but what of kim jong il?  there is a virtual holocaust occurring in north korea because he diverts all his country's resources to their military and weapons programs while countless numbers of  his own people starve to death.   but we don't want to address such a problem - they have the bomb.    speaking of countries supporting nuclear proliferation, very few people realize that one of the worst offenders is pakistan.  they not only have an active nuclear program, but are in a perpetual nuclear standoff with india and, worst of all, sell the technology to other countries.    saudi arabia is one of the worst culprits in terms of perpetuating a friendly training environment for terrorists, but of course they're friendly big oil so we won't disturb them either.    so why iraq.  because of september 11.  not because saddam had anything to do with the attack (as much as everyone wants to believe it, and does), but because it gave our ever overly-stalwart administration a suitable reason to do what our leader has wanted to do for some time.  and being a country of bull-headed big-guns big-tits petroleum pissing-contest brutes that we are, we believe headlines and pictures, and don't bother reading the articles.  say jump and we'll say how high.  especially when we think we're hitting back (which i think alot of people have been wanting to be able to do for some time, or at least been wanting to think they're justified in doing.  make sense?).  right now it's a great morale booster for our friends serving in iraq that saddam was found, and for that i am very glad.  really though i think his capture will ultimately be a bad thing, especially if it leads to four more years.  no one will  ever  agree with me, and/or think me unpatriotic and/or unamerican (whatever that is anymore), but wait five years and see what the retrospective looks like.  sorry about going off on a political tirade.  i had to write about something other than my non-existent existence (ha, and ha).  from here until next november i'm going to be nervous about anything good that happens for bushy.  we should all just bend over (i hope i'm nearby when the blonde from that virgin mobile commercial bends over).  or apply for jobs with haliburton.    album du jour:   urlLink   radiohead        hail to the thief   appropriate no?  bush = honest   -if-   2 + 2 = 5

      time shouldn't be represented in a line.  it's really just a single point (thank you margaret atwood).  the past exists only in memory and the future is obviously indeterminable.  i'm waiting for the day i wake up at fifty (should i live that long) and think back to when i was 25 and say to myself "fuck it seems like a minute ago".  these thoughts pervading my mind almost make me want to end it all right now and just get it over with.  not because i'm depressed or immersed in self pity or anything (which i coincidentally am), but just because one day i'll be getting chemotherapy and pissing into a bag and will only be able to think about what a waste my life was.  i'm 25 right now and am already doing it (regretting wasted time, not pissing in a bag).  what's worse is i have no clue how to prevent such a situation.  no path i can think of seems like it wouldn't be an utter meaningless existence, which really isn't my fault.  i should just be embittered that all lifestyles available are shit and curse the universe for forcing me to choose one.  i'd like to be a rock star (how original) but that would probably entail me getting out of bed at some point, so fuck it.  it's not a really purposeful life anyway.  i'll just wallow in my outward and inward contempt until i have to go to the store to buy food.

      for the last decade or so i have been a diet coke addict.  my consumption rates vary, but in the last year or so i've been operating at a 4-can-a-day level.  it's the caffeine mostly, but it's just always been something i can't start my days (or nights, depending on when and if i wake up) without.  for the last week, however, i haven't had a single one.  i've been drinking my green tea in the morning, which is much more suitable for cold weather (i always leave my windows open in the winter).  and i am just astounded at how much more energy i have since i gave up the dc.  people say all tha time that aspertane (from the artificial sweeteners) is bad for you in many ways, and usually that just made me want it more.  but i really think that it was draining me, despite the caffeine.  so now, as a major lifestyle change, i am officially off of diet coke.    i bet if a crack addict read this entry they'd want to kick my ass.  (diet coke?  ever suck dick for 25 cents and a piece of cardboard nigga?!?).  what am i saying, crackies don't read.    album du jour:   urlLink   stretch princess        fun with humans   check out their home page and look at the guy on the left (i think his name is james wright).  he has this oh-shit-man-i-just-trashed-my-dad's-beamer-on-prom-night-and-i-forgot-my-name look.  i found it tres drole.

      well today was really shitty.  i have some rather serous monetary problems, but at least it came at a good time during the year - not alot of stuff i have to buy for people or anything.  merry christmas movie house!  you motherfucking movie house!  i want to write more, but i'm afraid that it would just be too loathesome and angrily contrived.  so i'm going to take my sleeping pills and go to sleep.

      today is the anniversary of the attack on pearl harbor, and everyone seems to solemnly remember and appropriately mourn the tragedy.  but what about the ben affleck/josh hartnett pearl harbor movie?  was it not at least tantamount to the event itself in terms of devastation?  i have boycotted bruckheimer films ever since (and seriously questioned why i never did from the get-go).  perhaps the film's opening should be a national day of rememberence - for the countless innocents who threw away seven fifty in hopes of experiencing a worthy tribute, and instead found themselves immersed in a quagmire of trite dialogue, overacting, and characters that we wanted to die horrible flaming deaths.  not to mention the aww-shucks-ma'am western slang/love triangle/best friend's pregnant wife/bastard child named after best friend/soap drama aspects.  it all makes me swell up with something other than civic pride.

      my only personal christmas tradition:  i drink  whiskey with ice while watching  it's a wonderful life  and sometimes make myself tear up a bit at the end.  i have to be alone with all the lights out whilst this happens.  it sounds lonely but i really do enjoy it.  i will be spending the holidays back in san antonio, as i may have mentioned, and my two-week visit is going to be peppered with visit's to my mom's psychologist, so that i may allay her and my dad's concerns.  i just learned that she needed one - apparently because of me and my life's lack of direction (or my reverse interpretation of it).  i had no idea what to give my mother for christmas, but now i've found out that i've already given her the gift of emotional distress.  as a stocking stuffer i may inflict some manic depression or bipolarity.  i'll just throw the guilt of causing my mother mental anguish on the pile of esteem-fucks i currently push up the hill.

      here's something that i think aptly typifies the grammy awards:  fountains of wayne has been nominated for best new artist.  that's right - after eight years of being together and three albums.  i bet the editors of rolling stone issue grammy nods.  and all is right with the world.  how marvelous it is when the weather turns cold.  it just makes everything better.

      i just got done cutting grass (hopefully for the last time this "winter") and noticed a familiar smell of a different kind of grass wafting over from our upper-class neighbor's chicken coop.  low and behold, our pre-teen gangster friends emerge, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.  i thought about threatening to call the police on them if they didn't share with me, but then thought better and let sleeping dogs lie.

      i'm just a little sad today.  especially this time of the day, when the day hasn't quite gone and the night isn't quite here, and somewhere scott baio is plowing a woman he doesn't love.  are there symptoms of listlessness or is listlessness a symptom of something else?  probably both.  but at any rate, i'm there.  maybe i should turn on a light.

      currently i am on the second floor of the lafayette public library, looking out over the rather delapidated downtown area.  at least my view is delapidated.  as i have little else to do, i decided to break out the laptop and write away as i wait for 5:00 (when cindy gets off).    after my vision tomfoolery at the blind center i should be getting some insanely powerful reading glasses (no doubt they'll be the height of fashion) and some peripheral device to hook up to my computer that will in essence woork like a closed-circuit tv (also to aid in reading).  i can't say whether i'll actually use this stuff or not - alot of times they seem like good ideas when i'm testing them out but are later abandoned out of laziness.  i really would like to be able to actually read the articles in my magazines instead of fumbling through titles and pawing at the pretty pictures.  this morning on cnn i watched nearly the entire length of some congressional hearing concerning iraq and supposed wmd's they had stockpiles of and when.  david kay, the former chief inspector, discussed how no actual weapons were found to be in the ocuntry.  yet several quotes were brought up from cheany, bush, et. al. pre-war proclaiming that iraq did indeed have the bombs.  so now it's a question of whether or not the intelligencfe was bad or whether the white house exaggerated certain facts to gain support for the war.  at any rate, it's a big quagmire of who-did-what (i just want to know what you knew and when you knew it senator).  personally i think much of the hard evidence was skewed pre-war into pro-war propaganda by the bush administration, but of course my opinion is influenced by the fact that i hate them, and of course the fact that they're all liars hell-bent on self interests (as evidenced by the lucrative iraqi rebuilding contracts that went only to american companies with direct ties to rumsfeld and cheaney).   i recognize the fact that all politicians are basically liars and crooks, republican or democrat, but bush and co. just seem so brazen and unconcerned with any type of consequences their selfish actions may warrant that it seems to me that they think they can wield free reign.  it's always the lesser of evils with politics.  so it's 4:47 and almost time to skedaddle.  i'll be a million bucks i'm going to have sex tonight.  sex is a funny thing - if you hadn't had it in a while and you want to make that good first impression by being spectacular you can't perform worth shit (from a male perspective), but when you are getting it regularly and you know you're going to keep getting it regularly you have the capacity to be a fucking tiger, when really you don't need to.  i think that's one of those cosmic practical jokes.  i feel a cold coming on.  and fuck, i was just about over the last one.  god damn you universe!!!!  you and your twisted sex jokes!!!!!     album du jour:   urlLink   further seems forever       the moon is down

      this afternoon i spilled dr. pepper on my keyboard so i finally had to bite the bullet and hook up my wireless that i got for xmas.  i was just being lazy, in re. not hooking i up.  it really is pretty cool.  i wonder how long it will be before i spill something on this one.  watch this:  right now i'm on my bed lying down  now i'm sitting in front of my tv  right now i'm not even looking.....back turned to (on) all of you (all both of you)  i'm going to squat in cindy's apartment for a couple of days so i may be incommunicado.  do you like avacado?  she works during the day so i need to bring some type of arts & crafts projects.  i was thinking of taking all my entertainment weekly magazines and making some pre-emptive collage christmas cards (past efforts have included "a ricky martin cailente crhistmas" and duran duran "hungy like the jesus" cards).    plus tomorrow i'm going to the low-vision aid center here in lafayette to experiement with all types of visual aids (at the low-vision aid center?  get the fuck out...).  maybe i will finally be able to learn how to read.    album du jour:   urlLink   doves       the last broadcast

      i can't explain the lack of blog inspiration.  everyone knows it's much easier to write when depressed and/or angered, but lately i've been neither.  you'd think i would be awash with relief at being currently on the upswing, but really i almost miss the moodiness.  i strangely take solace in the probability that i will sink again ( everything  is cyclical).  how fucked up is that.  i'm thinking about writing a book.  i haven't really read any good literature in quite some time though, so i think i need to do that first.  writing well stems from reading a large quantity of quality books.  of latei feel prettyreatarded - not being able to think of words/synonyms, forgetting things that i'm positive i used to know, etc.  some of this may be attributed to the aging process and the binge drinking and aerosol abuse.  a friend of mine is moving to montana next week to live with her 22-year old boyfriend (whom we affectionately refer to as "johnny montana").  what is there in montana?  is it big sky country?  what is that?  i understand wanting to leave louisiana, but for montana....it's too far from saltwater, and i think the further from saltwater you are the more inane the population gets.  just look at the red versus blue states during election returns.  it's like butter.    album du jour:   urlLink   the sea and cake       oui

      here's something i've never heard before.  i was chatting with my good friend jill in arkansas and somewhere in our conversation she mentioned that at the moment she likes to live vicariously through me.  let's all really pray hard to our respective deities that jill is happy and healthy soon.  did anyone see howard dean turn into the incredible hulk in iowa last weekend?  it was such a scene.  he's a good candidate but shoots himself in the foot repetitively it seems like.    my friend went to a henry rollins concert in new orleans last night.  i don't know what to make of that, except that if you're going to go to new orleans there's usually several bands playing on the same night so i'm sure you could find something better to do than see henry rollins.  but to each his own.  what does it mean that i've started to make time in the afternoon to watch oprah?  am i turning into a middle-aged overweight black woman?  should i buy some luther vandross cd's?  shouuld i fake winning the ohio lottery?      album du jour:   urlLink   catherine wheel       chrome

      my apologies for being lax in my blog upkeep, but i tend to need a few days rest after a night of binge drinking.  i guess i can't use that as an excuse - i sleep for days on end generally without reason.  but it was an interesting weekend, frought with drama which, thankfully, had nothing to do with me, but unfotunately i had to bear witness to.  not a fan of the drama.  especially drama involving drunk whores who like to tell stories (ala taxicab confessions).  but luckily drunk ranting whores can be dropped off and quickly forgotten, especially when your alcohol consumption converts much of the night's unfortunate experiences into what i like to call "blackouts".  demon liquor my ass.    i had a very nice martin luther king jr. day, watching many movies (none of which were very spectacular), laughing and lying.  i watched  the mothman prophecies  last night and it really scared me, which is a good thing because i rarely get frightened by movies anymore.  it definitely now carries my seal of approval.  another day of movies with cindy tomorrow.  it's nice to find someone who can sit through eight movies in a row with you, with occasional sarcastic comments insterted where necessary (and other things inserted where unnecessary  have i said too much oh my god? ).    album du jour:   urlLink   the stills        logic will break your heart

      ding dong the chickens is gone.  i was feeling litigious this morning so i called the police to report a noise disturbance as a result of our neigybor's poultry clucking, and low-and-behold the chickens is no more.  words can't quite describe my elation at the newfound sounds of silence.  and just ask me how guilty i feel about it.  it's supposed to rain all weekend, but there's a party i want to go to tomorrow night so i'm conflicted.  i may just compromise and stay in my room and get drunk.  happy mediums.  i'm selling 14 of my vhs tapes as a lot on ebay for nine bucks, so if anyone is interested then just click  urlLink here .  if you don't want to pay nine bucks make me an offer i can't refuse.  these are they:  South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut Scarface (2-VHS) The Matrix Swingers The Shawshank Redemption Less Than Zero Traffic Pollock Desperado (w/ Antonio Banderas) Reservoir Dogs Angela's Ashes Ferris Bueller's Day Off Memento Wonder Boys   not a bad lot of movies, i'm just converting to dvd.  if you buy within the next ten minutes i'll throw in some crack rock and toilet paper free.     album du jour:   urlLink   helium        the dirt of luck

      across the street today there was a tree removal company cutting down this giant oak tree, which i believe was dead anyway, in our neighbor's yard.  when they cut the main trunk and the behemoth toppled over it shook the ground rather vehemently.  at the time i was here at my computoer doing god knows what, and i about pissed myself.  it was like that scene from  donny darko  when maggie gyllenhall enters her house at the beginning of the movie and you see the entire house shake (which we later find out is a plane engine falling on the house).  it was pretty weird, but definitely cool post hoc.

      my twin 11-year old cousins are sleeping over tonight.  i'm always happy when they do since it offers me an opportunity to corrupt their young minds with various inappropriate media (for instance, i showed them  american psycho  one night.  isn't it a classic though?  shouldn't kids watch classics?).  the way i see it, i'm giving them the knowledge that will help them in social circles that i never had, and still don't in many ways.  that way they don't just act like an amalgomation of their parents, as i was relegated to doing in my formative years.  psycho-babble.  speaking of parochial misadventures - our allustrious ltg (little teenage gangster) neighbors somehow procured a chainsaw with which to amuse themselves.  odd, since their yard is roughly twelve feet by twelve feet and contains nothing in the way of plant life.  i should just buy a gun from a pawn shop and leave it on their doorstep.  sooner or later they'd have to do themselves in, accidentally or otherwise.  social darwinism at it's finest.  my friend cindy and i are having a movie night tonight.  she's bringing  children of the corn , which i have never seen and am very much looking forward to.  on the subject of movies, i bought the following dvd's today, despite my resolution to curb my spending habits of late:    less than zero better off dead swingers jawbreaker freeway   most were from the $5.88 bin at wal-mart, which you really can't beat (if i were a richer man i would boycott wal-mart forever - corporate bitches).  i've only seen the first three.    album du jour:   urlLink   royal trux        cats & dogs

      i sold about twenty of my old cd's on ebay this past week.  going through my old collection really makes me wonder what the hell was wrong with me way back when (i had a dave matthews band and jesus jones cd in there).  then i wonder what the people who bought them from me present day are like - perhaps just like me about 10 years ago?  musical taste is a curiously indicative hobby.  it's always good to discover artists you really like and then go back to listen to their earlier work, so i have to applaud the retroactive sensibility of the thing.  and i guess i can't really throw stones, since after all these are my adolescently archaic cd's which at some point i thought were worth buying (or scamming a music club for).  and even though i'm glad someone wants this stuff, i have to mourn the fact that there is want for such crap.  but imagine what i'll consider crap ten years from now...    album du jour:   urlLink   pussy galore        dial m for motherfucker   not an easy task when you google "pussy galore" looking for a decent band website.  bunch of perverts in this world (only kidding - i bookmarked everything)

      ever notice how, no matter how low your self-image, when you see yourself in a photograph it's always worse than you think.  especially with a flash - it's not as if i look pale like a vampire as it is, but i think my complexion actually reflects the light causing my face to look...well...illuminated (which it  never  does otherwise.  usually i'm try for very dark and brooding - the whole byronic thing).  i just need to get my hands on some adobe photoshop and i'll be sated.    speaking of satiation, i just bought  donnie darko  on dvd, in an effort to beef up my somewhat paltry dvd collection.  i also would like to unload some of my vhs's, although i doubt i could find buyers for some of them.  i really just want to free up space on my desk, so i have a clutter-free space upon which to bang my head when the mood strikes me.  i don't think that's unreasonable.  goddamned clutter.  makes me want to hit my head on the.....oh.  fuck.    album du jour:   urlLink   burnside project        the networks, the circuits, the streams, the harmonies

      it's not the end of the world, but if it were the sky outside would really be appropriate - very ominous and brooding.  it's just raining slightly and is eerily sans thunder.  it reminds me of ghostbusters 1.  yesterday i just realized i can score (check out) movies from our local library, which is easily within walking distance.  i suppose i could also check out some of these new-fangled "books" that you hear so much about these days.  we here in milton don't take too kindly to them wordy-words though.  i'm such an ignorant bastard sometimes.  the thing i regret most about 2003 was the lack of any kind of personal inertia.  the thing i liked most about 2003 was the over-indulgence, which i also hated.    album du jour:   urlLink   the butchies        are we not femme?   this is a really cool site, surf even if you don't care

      so many of my christmas presents require a usb port on my computer - my canon, my external hard drive, scanner (not a new item - just one i happened to find in my old closet), mp3 player, and wireless keyboard/mouse receiver.  and since my desktop is somewhat old it only has 2 ports, so i'm using my laptop's as well (the two are networked).  i feel mad.....delightfully,  whimsically  mad (sometimes i smell my hands because they remind me of my mother!)!  and also i feel a bit out of control - buying dvd's like they're going out of style.  i also bought these really boss leather wristbands (rockstyle) to go with the leather condom i bought.  all studded, naturally.  is louisiana really that disagreeable that it has to be 80 fucking degrees in january?  isn't it unpleasant enough?    album du jour:   urlLink   the cranes        population 4

      while away from the house we left five litterboxes and a huge pile of food for the cat, and today i was cleaning this shit out of the boxes while the cat was sitting atop the dryer staring at me.  she had this look on her face like "yes, you'll clean up my shit and you'll like it bitch".  it was not one of my most dignifying moments.  probably the worst of the year so far, although the initial hours of 2004 are a bit hazy.

The tiny spare that you create It can inspire and duplicate And soon it spreads from state To state from Williamsburg to Silverlake A thousand voices, are you listening?  This is our emergency

      to all white (and black - all this is really unbecoming for anyone) people -  heretofore please refrain from using the following words/phrases as slang:  da bomb, mad (as in "my boy got mad skills"), sick (as in "my boy's skills is sick"), props, mad props, no you didn't, don't go there, talk to the hand, hella.  also, desist making the following gestures:  raising the roof, air quotes, air fisty, crouching tiger hidden dragon.  i don't know if that last one's a move.  at any rate, when did jargon become so nauseating and obnoxious.  it doesn't even come across as remotely cool, just borderline retarded.  perhaps a little too much abbreviation.  try to decipher a modern-day hip-hop song - it's like trying to understand kenny.    album du jour:   urlLink   death cab for cutie       tranatlanticism

      why should i be made to suffer through previews of every ashley judd suspense-thriller black-costar movie that comes out, at frequencies of about once a week.  and the woman really can't act.  she is easy on the eyes, which is the only thing i find endearing about her.    sometimes i'm almost glad when crappy videos come on mtv2 late at night, since otherwise i may never break myself away.  a rare occurrence - finding that much good programming on either of the mtv's - but it does occasionally happen with the spuradic look-back specials.  you can always count on hip-hop or pop to dissuade you though.  and by dissuade i mean make you nauseous.    album du jour:   urlLink   the minders       golden street

      a friend of mine and i are seriously considering starting our own webcast, although i have virtually no idea what you need to do it.  i'll do some googling later and check it out.  if anyone knows anything i'd love an e-mail.  i'm sure it involves setting up some sort of server capable of accepting connections, which my computer may or may not be able to handle.  this would really give me an almost productive hobby.  there are probably beaucoup licensing fees to deal with though, so i won't get my hopes up.  i sat down and sorted all of my cd's, taking the discs out of the flip-books i had them in and matching them up with the cases.  consider that i have thousands of cd's and you can understand that it took me a while.  i'm going to see how many i can sell, of those i want to sell.  i have all of my music copied to my hard drive so really i could and maybe should just sell them all, but i think i would like to maintain a modest collection of my absolute favorites.  it's important to have something for people to peruse when you have company over (aren't i suddenly optimistic?), that way they can scratch their heads at the titles and artists that they've never heard of, and i can feel secretly superior inside.  seriously, i'm not a music snob.  the cousin kids spent the night tonight.  i think two of them are actually still awake in the living room watching something they probably shouldn't.  bless their hearts.      album du jour:   urlLink   poster children       daisychain reaction   warning: this site is very abrasive to the ocular sensitivities, click with care.

      i honestly don't want to feel a smug satisfaction at the fact that it will probably rain on everyone's parade for lundi/mardi gras.  i want to be the one disappointed that my fun will be damp.  i want to be the girl with the most cake.  my new goal is to get to the point where i'm actually resentful when it rains.  that should be a pretty good signpost.  as of now i own  lost in translation  and am whole-heartedly in love with one scarlett johanson (and am experiencing an odd emotion concerning bill murray that i'd rather not dwell on - kidding).  it wasn't what i expected, but all the same i will still marry sofia coppola.    album du jour:   urlLink   damone       from the attic

      for the second time in as many weeks i've ordered a dvd on ebay that never came in.  i'm not realy pissed - paypal offers buyer protection so i will be reimbursed - i'm just curious as to why people think they can act fraudulently and get away with it on ebay.  green-eyed monster i guess.  for about five years in a row, something dramatically terrible would happen to me over the mardi gras holiday.  one year i totalled my car and got arrested, another year i got dumped, another year my apartment was broken into.  as such, i have vowed to batten down the hatches and ride mardi gras out like george clooney in a hurricaine.  it's not just my bad luck at this time of year, i also genuinely dislike the event.  i've never enjoyed standing on the side of the road drinking and running over children for plastic jewelry or fake coins (which, i learned, you can get into trouble for trying to buy things with - bad mardi gras number 5), or being sassy to cops while drunk (bad year number 4).  i'm aware that it's great fun for the masses, but the way i figure it i pretty much party like it's mardi gras on almost a weekly basis the rest of the year, so i'm not missing much.  plus i really hate crowds (although i love gatherings).    album du jour:   urlLink   turin brakes       the optimist lp

      as long as i live i will never understand the vast popularity of auto racing.  are circles really that interesting?  or ovals, whatever.  it's no surprise our plucky president attended, bless his heart.  i think it's hilarious that the drivers have so many advertisements sewn to their jump suits and adorning their cars.  i think all the other major sports should do the same thing; that would completely bottom out what little opinion i have of professional sports.    last night i had a dream that i killed these two dogs with a sword, but then felt so bad that i used my magic powers to bring them back to life.  i woke up feeling guilty so i went to the store and bought a box of milkbones for the neighborhood mixed breeds (mutts).  why would i have a dream like that - i really love animals.    album du jour:   urlLink   phaser       sway

      i remember in the olden days how much i looked forward to sunday night and watching  120 minutes  on mtv/mtv2.  that, along with  amp , were the only shows i would watch on the station(s).  now the only decent show that comes on is  subterranean , from eleven to midnight every sunday.  and although it plays good videos (with the exception of the fucking polyphonic spree), it plays the same ones a bit repetitively, and only lasts an hour.  my left nut for some quality programming.

      i realized when i woke up last evening that i only have about 3 basic dreams.  one involves either my parents yelling at me or me yelling at them (very vulgarly, maliciously).  the second is that i'm still waiting tables and i'm in the weeds (restaurant term meaning busy as fuck) with people pulling me in all different directions.  the third is that i am still in school - ranging from middle through college - and i have some critical test coming up in a class which i haven't been to in months (often times graduation hinges upon it).  i understand that these are probably the situations in my life which have caused me the most stress, but i haven't experienced them in quite some time (at least two years), with the exception of that first one.  what's worse is that i almost prefer having these as opposed to the good dreams, when i wake up and am thoroughly disappointed at my comparative reality.  it's like going to the movie theater and seeing a great movie and being taken out of your life for a couple of hours, then getting slammed back down to earth when the lights come up.  not a great sensation.    album du jour:   urlLink   stars       heart   i really wish i knew how to make music play when a website opens up.  if someone out there is privy to said information please let me know and i'll send you a cookie.

      wow our president sure has had a bad week.  the wmd investigation/continued questioning, military service gaps, medicare bill  $100 billion  miscalc, pointless space travel endeavors, and a virutally incoherent interview on   meet the press ...it all makes me smile :o)  wesley clark said something about how the only people that george w. has united (remember the uniter-not-a-divider claim?) are the democrats and other opponents of his.    jesus i hate valentine's day.  it's such a contrived holiday whose purpose is to force the male consumer to frivolously spend money on short-lived flower bouquets and overpriced candy.  and it we don't do it what happens - the penis goes in a mayonnaise jar by the side of the bed.  and if you don't have that "special someone" (that phrase makes me want to eat my own arm) then you just feel dejected and lonely.  i fucking hate valentine's day.  i guess there was too much fiscal space between christmas and easter and someone decided that this would be a good way to boost consumer spending during the gap.  valentine's day sucks balls.

      Microsoft: In the crapper?  Part 1 The PC in the WC. On April 30, Microsoft U.K. issues a press release touting a new product called the iLoo, an Internet-enabled toilet equipped with a Wi-Fi broadband connection, a plasma flat screen, a waterproof keyboard, and sponsored toilet paper festooned with Web addresses. According to the release, the iLoo will "allow instant logging on."   Part 2 Johnny on the spot. Twelve days later, after much snickering in morning newspapers and on late-night talk shows, Microsoft flacks back in Redmond come up with a clever strategy for damage control. The iLoo, says spokeswoman Kathy Gill, was merely an "April Fool-like joke."   Part 3 Something doesn't smell right. The next day, realizing that nobody's buying the April-Fool's-joke-29-days-after-April-Fool's-Day explanation, Microsoft calls back reporters and admits that it had told an iLulu: The project was indeed real but has subsequently been killed. "We jumped the gun basically yesterday in confirming that it was a hoax," says MSN group product manager Lisa Gurry. "In fact, it was not."

      has there ever been a scientific study that pinpoints the time during a person's life at which you start being an adult?  i remember when i was young(er) and looking ahead to being an adult, when somehow everything would seem different and i would have some profound sense of responsibility and purpose and cognizance that previously i didn't have.  and now i'm 25 and drifting indecisively though life not having the slightest sense of what i should be doing at this point in time.  i could (and probably should) get a job, etc., but i don't think that has anything to do with the matter anymore.  a job doesn't make you an adult.  my younger brother is flying fighter planes (ala  top gun ) while i sit here playing stupid repetitive computer games all day and listening to music.  that would really fuck up my self-image if i had one.  maybe i'm just trapped in that adolescent stage of life where not much is expected of you (relatively speaking) and you don't expect to do much.  or maybe i'm just lazy and immature.  jimmy crack whore and i don't care.    album du jour:   urlLink   symposium       on the bbc

      i saw on this program on the discovery channel yesterday about baboons, which are essentially large apes.  did anyone know that they eat smaller monkeys?  they showed one capture a spider monkey or something and just tear it apart like rush limbaugh going at a chicken wing (hiiiooooo).  it was one of the most disturbing images i've ever seen - rather like seeing a big hairy human eating a smaller hairy human.  some humans probably should be eaten though, and not in that good way.  why do i waste so much time playing these senseless word games.  i bet i spend about an average of two hours a day playing fucking text twist on msn.  i guess i'm just a natural born fan of mindless repitition.  i don't like complicated computer games or playstation games (not really), just these simple card and word games.  even in my recreation i'm lazy.  how about that.  and speaking of the confounded playstation, i checked out some dvd's from the local library and the fucker won't play them.  i get all situated in my bed with my tasty beveage, turn off the lights, looking forward to a quality couple of hours, insert the dvd and the fucker won't play.  i don't take well to this ilk of disappointment.    album du jour:   urlLink   phaser       sway

      being depressed is like walking around with a big wet carpet on top of you.  it's during these periods that i keep myself on a steady diet of sleep aids -  doxylamine succinate (25mg) or diphenhydramine hcl (non-habit forming) or, when i want an all-around xanax-comparable experience, i use acetamenophin (500mg) and dyphenhydramine hydrochloride (25mg) in conjunction with the two aforementioned.  really these are all just over-the-counter sleep aids, but i like to be dramatic at times.  when i come to these fight-or-flight situations i go with option inconsciousness, which i suppose really is a type of flight.  i got some posters in the mail that i ordered on ebay (about a month ago slow-shipping dicks!) of the dandy warhols, elastica, the rapture, blake babies, and the raveonettes.  i'm not going to put them up while i'm still living with my aunt - only when i have my own place will i allow myself to put them up and enjoy them.  motivation for the un-motivated.    album du jour:   urlLink   stereolab       margerine eclipse   in general i'm not a huge fan of stereolab; their albums usually have one or two tracks that i like and the rest is borderline filler, but i really enjoyed this, their latest.

      this afternoon i dreamt about nascar (yes, the cars that do circles).  for some reason i had an aerial view of the last lap of a race, and the winner won and got out of his (or her,  do women race?) car and was congratulated enmasse.  but then two men among the mob pulled out guns, a mix of rifles and handguns, and just started shooting people dead.  the crowd started running and scattering but the guys kept picking off stragglers.   the winning driver walked up to one of them to plead with him to stop but the gunman shot him in the face.  this dream really wreaked of tranch-coatness, which is not me at all.  i think maybe it's just some manifestation of my extreme distaste for auto racing, or sports of any kind really (except for most extreme elmination challenge on spike - that shit is redonkulous!).  what i'm curious about is this:  the day before i have a dream about something that i usually don't dream about i have a passing thought about the subject for roughly one to two seconds, and that's all.  for many years it was tim curry and the movie  it , because i remember that movie sticking with me for a while (mostly because i was probably too young to have been watching it and it scared the bejeezus out of me).  i don't remember thinking about auto racing yesterday though.  i don't think i even turned on the tv yesterday.  the only thing i could come up with is that there's a song called  nascar  by this band  urlLink francine  that i really like, and i believe it was on rotation yesterday here in my one-room brothel.  i should start listening to songs about fornication.  2 live crew comes to mind.    album du jour:   urlLink   air       talkie walkie   i'm so emo lately.

      on the road three houses down from my house was a dead dog.  i stared at it for ten minutes i think.  i was still fucked up from the pine sol.  it was just too pitiful not to look at, and made me sadder the longer i conceived it.  and the blaring contradiction stared me in the face, of lamenting a dead stray yet feeling nothing at speargunning my father's father.  the notion of being a hypocrite is very unappealing to me, but i figured if millions of church-goers could do it why not me.  i'm no better than anyone, far worse in most cases.  so i finally went inside my shanty.  i tripped over my fucking scooty-puff in the dark and kicked it into the kitchen.  i turned on my metronome without turning on the lights, then took some red bull and vodka from the fridge.  this day sucked.  every day sucked, but this one in particular, what with having to kill a relative and the dead dog and all.  not to mention my fucking scooty-puff, which i think now had pieces missing.  i sat on the floor and opened my mail.    album du jour:   urlLink   midwest product       specifics

      anymore i can't lie unconscious and not have stress nightmares concerning the countless technical manuals i was force-fed during my education.  the questions of morality that then plagued me dredge up feelings of guilt and worry that during my waking hours i do not have.  but all fades away as i rise, this time staring at the barely rotating ceiling fan in pa-pap's shitty kitchen.  it's missing a blade.  briefly i forget where i am but then recognize the aftertaste of pine, and recall my current situation.  my job is done, so i leave as sleuthly as i came, grabbing the bowl of antacids from the kitchen table for solitaire colon games later.  i'm going to walk the nine miles home.    album du jour:   urlLink   blonde redhead       misery is a butterfly

      it's a giant community-killer that cyphens the life out of local small businesses - pet stores (wal-mart now sells fish - live and frozen), grocers, etc. (we've all been to wal-mart, you can get underwear and liquor and fake plants all in the same place).  while i disapprove of the wal-mart practice of undercutting smaller businesses and driving them under, and the whole illegal immigrant abuse thing, i'm poor and relegated to shopping there for now.  but when i get a job, fuck you wal-mart.  lady friend came over last night and we discussed some things and decided that we're better off being friends.  i am relieved.      album du jour:   urlLink   blonde redhead       misery is a butterfly

      yesterday while riding into town with my cousin there was a pretty bad traffic accident that made us about half an hour late for my appointment with my shrink, and i was thinking while waiting that being in line trying to get past an accident is like waiting in a line for some sort of exhibit.  your reward for giving up your time is that you get to see some potentially real carnage and maybe even some raw human emotion.  i'm not sadistic enough to say that i take great pleasure in the misfortunes of others (i would rarely actually wish such things on someone), but if it's there anyway then why not observe and feel a bit better that you're not that person?  a traffic accident is also analagous to a pyramid scheme - if you get in early (see it right after it happened) you are rewarded with a scene, but if you're way back in line you may have to wait so long that all you get to see are skid marks.     as i said, i was late for my psychologist's appointment and really glad because of it.  all he does is repeat right back to me whatever it is i say - no real insight there.  he did give me a sample of some kind of artificial sweetener (how that topic came about i can't recall).  three packets for a hundred bucks - not bad eh?  there are several instances of these really awkward pauses where no one says a thing and i want to jump out the window or eat my own hand.  i'm going to have to start coming up with material during the week to talk about so i'm not bored to death.  i'd rather not go at all, but it's all to allay whatever it is my parents are thinking about me.  maybe they should be in therapy.     album du jour:   urlLink   maxeen       maxeen

      methinks i'm going to start working out in the morning instead of later in the day.  it's not  really  morning.  in the traditional sense i suppose it is.  my sleeping pattern lately has been to crash around four in the afternoon and wake up at two a.m.  so if i'm working out, say, at seven then really it's more like doing it in the afternoon (haha, i said "doing it".  no more beavis and butt-head marathons for me on mtv2 saturday nights).  except i almost feel like a normal person that gets up at the crack of whatever to exercise before heading off to work (robots!!!).  i should also cut the grass today.  how wonderfully outdoorsy of me - i am such a man.  my back even hurts.    album du jour:   urlLink   the rosebuds       the rosebuds make out

      to be cursed with the title of elderberry-killer.  it is a life sans compassion or love of any kind.  there are only colors of black and red, and grey.  my grandfather was a new low - never before had it been such a close relative.  years ago i found a great uncle on the list, but he wasn't close, and i think he molested one of my second cousins at some point in the past.  now that i think of it she always was a real cunt rag.  maybe that explains it.  nevertheless, spearing pa-pap in the gut ended up leaving my own stomach uneasy.  i hurdled his now idle body and searched for the medicine cabinet.  about the only benefit of this lifestyle was the bevy of booty at my disposal contained in most seniors' medicine cabinets.  it almost made me look forward to old age.  pa-pap, despite the respirator and wheel chair, was in surprisingly spry shape (excluding of course the two-foot steel rod penetrating his lower intestines).  his stockpile consisted only of medamucil and some sort of generic multivitamins.  angrily, i kicked his carcass en route to my secondary source.  he had little else but pine sol under the sink.  i made do.    album du jour:   urlLink   built to spill       perfect from now on

      since my life lately hasn't provided much fodder for really quality blog matter i'm just going to start making up stuff in the style of a really trite novel.   he squeezed the trigger of the speargun, firing a piercing shot through the lower torso of his grandfather.  the old man, unable to scream due to the respirator, slumped over and fell out of the antique wheel chair he loathed.  he lay there motionless, save for the struggling rise and fall of his chest as he battled for air.  the stagnant mutton joint he was gumming hourse earlier lay near him.  the pet ferrett carried it away.  young man walked to his grandfather and calmly whispered, "less filling, bizatch".     album du jour:   urlLink   moloko       do you like my tight sweater?

      last night i could not would not fall asleep.  i was trying to avoid taking my nightly sleeping pill cocktail to stave off addiction.  so up all night doing nothing.  i watched  american splendor  which i thought was surprisingly depressing and hilarious.  the actor playing the main character is a guy named paul giamatti, but i'll forever know and refer to him as pig vomit (from the howard stern movie).  pig vomit is a good actor.  pig vomit could easily play the lead in the life story of jon lovitz.  then i cut the grass at eight because it was supposed to rain late-morning and our yard was getting overgrown.  our high-class next-door neighbors throw empty doritos bags in our yard and i like running over them.  also ant hills.  i always think about that part of  honey, i shrunk the kids  where the kids are all hanging on to a blade of grass trying not to get sucked up into the mower.  i make sure to linger over ant hills, just in case some ants or annoying little shrunken kids are hanging around in there.  smug, tiny sons of bitches.    album du jour:   urlLink   blind mr. jones       stereo muscale

      this is the persuasive essay i wrote for my cousin.  i was going to do the anti-teen abstinance topic but the word count thing was messing me up, so i wrote an essay expressing displeasure for length restrictions on writing assignments in school.  i hope it sounds like a high school paper.  i really don't remember what that is.  also, sorry for submitting what is essentially a bullshit filler entry, but i'm lazy.  anyway, colon:  The writing proces is one depdendent on a person's creativity.  Whether writing for journalism, school, or a magazine (among many others), the creative process is highly complicated.  Difficulties run rampant during any writing process, even when no restrictions exist concerning the length of a work.  Therefore, no writing assignment should ever be constrained by size limits, especially in an educational environment.  Often it seems criteria are placed on the maximum lengths of writing assignments in hopes of encouraging conciseness.  Should not the length of a paper depend solely on the subject matter though?  Setting a maximum number of pages or words only hurts the effectiveness of a body of work and the writer's ability to completely get his or her point across.  Such is especially true when the work is of a persuasive nature.  Requiring a minimum word count is just as counterproductive as requiring a maximum one.  If the writer is able to clearly and effectively state their position in, for instance, two pages, then forcing out an extra page (for a three-page assignment, in this example) would only encourage rambling.  An extra page of drivel does nothing but take away from a case trying to be made.  Some would say that essay length requirements are not entirely detrimantal.  Teaching students to focus on being concise with maximums or comprehensive with minimums can be an effective teaching tool, however, emphasizing subjects and making convincing arguments should be the top priority in a writer's education.  Limiting the size should be a distant second, but is too often over-emphasized.  The various subjects taught in schools have in each of them layer upon layer of varying elements, and learning the key ones is not easy.  Concerning English, and more specifically writing, subjectivity is something that is especially difficult to capture and put on paper.  The persuasive essay by nature is difficult enough without having size constraints, which seem to be always over-emphasized.    album du jour:   urlLink   the quails       atmosphere

       the inferno  was a rerun tonight so i ended up watching  the swan  on fox.  if you haven't heard of or seen it, the premise is that they take two plain-looking women and for three months put them through several plastic surgeries, exercise and diet routines, and counseling (some have mental anguish), all the while not being allowed to look at themselves in a mirror.  the big climax comes at the end of their three months when they see themselves for the first time and are delighted or dejected.  jimmy crack corn and i don't care about the contest aspect of the show (one of them is chosen at the end to go on to the final bauty contest), but i was thinking about plastic surgery.  i've been passively against it for the most part, and i was about to go on a mental tirade to myself (as i tend to do often - remember though i can be preachy now because i'm a narcissist) about the ills of aesthetics and society and all that superficial jazz, but it came to me that  if this rigorous identity-rape makes these people feel better about themselves, then what the frig.  of course if everyone does it we'll all end up looking alike, and individuality will be stifled, and we'd be screwing over mother nature, and bra sizes will force us to come up with a longer alphabet. and then, after everyone's faces and bodies look alike, we can start mandating uniforms like they do in catholic schools (and a startling amount of public ones), that way no one will stray outside of the box and cause radical thinking/practices.  hooray! the outliers will be gone!  we get rid of the religious fanatics and mother theresas all at the same time - that would be super.  so it would seem life, then, is just one big range of variables that somehow everyone wants to make less extreme.  change is scary, we don't like new things, and we're most contented with seeing the same movies and plot lines all the time and the same characters on tv.  so i should have been happy to watch my rerun of  the inferno .  and since i'm on tv, how influential is its power of suggesstion?.  everyone loves raymond?  then i should love it too...  must see tv?  jesus, i really must see it then.  american idol?  must... worship... talentless... clods...    album du jour:   urlLink   lali puna       scary world theory

      i just finished writing an informative essay for my cousin, who is a senior in high school, and am now about to start another one for him, this one a persuasive essay.  i'm wondering aloud about subjects.  is teenage abstinance something worthy of arguing against (it's not like they'll keep him from graduating if the teacher has a dissenting opinion)?  i just have to make some strong salient points, such as...for the girls, it makes boys like you.  and for the rest of your life you'll be able to reminisce with friends about all the sex you had in high school, and that will make you seem cool and popular.  also it gives you good experience for college, since you'll probably have to take biology, yes biology, sooner or later.  and boning while in high school means that you're taking an interest in something other than drugs that entails exercise and hones your social skills.  i see no downside.  although there is the possibility of pregnancy, std's, lawsuits, child support and death, but meh.  i mean come on, syphilis?  please.    album du jour:   urlLink   the siddeleys       slum clearance

      my parents were supposed to come for easter but my dad is too busy at work so they're not.  i was looking forward to a hassel-free family-free holiday weekend.  but low and behold one of my uhcle-and-aunt sets is coming to stay with us on saturday night.  they're very nice people and i really do like them.  their children are mostly my age - twentysomething - and have jobs and spouses.  it pains me to think how normal and good their lives are.  two of the weddings were actually in october and november of last year.  i didn't go to either.  i opted out because i couldn't endure a big gathering with lots of rarely-seen family members asking me the same questions that the family member right before them asked, of course pertaining to what i'm doing with myself (if they only knew!) and what my lofty aspirations are, job-wise.  it's like talkiing abou the weather with a stranger - talking about work with family.  and now i can't just not go, because they're coming to me, and they'll either be cross that i didn't go, think i don't like them, or i can fess up and be further enmeshed in self-image deprecation (and i can't think of a reasonable lie, which i am very good at doing).  i could fake my own kidnapping like that wisconsin girl.  that may actually be something i'd do anyway.  it would be fun to create a crime scene.    album du jour:   urlLink   snow patrol       final straw

      the rapture and black rebel motorcycle club in houston on the 18th, i'm in like the rose  i was doing dishes and i decided to do some air fencing with the big kettle spoon, so i did a perry and a thrust and probably some other fencing moves i'm not aware of, and when i was done the spoon was dry.  also i cut the grass and fed the cat and went to the post office and library.  what is wrong with me today, i'm not usually this productive.    album du jour:   urlLink   on!air!library!       on air library

      why do they think that if they put perforations on all four sides of the letter it will make me respond to whatever bullshit publication contest that i've mysteriously already won.  i didn't realize perforations were supposed to affect perceptions.  anyway.  gas bill, garbage pick-up, children international, something about fifteen dvd's for fifty cents, and the weekly pale yellow envelope (oddly not perforated).  it was the only thing i didn't discard.  i usually get at least four days to prepare for whatever the following assignment is.  the instructions come encrypted.  there's this decryption software cd i have to use to decipher the message (oddly labeled "aol version 5.1 with extended features".  how funny).  more often than not it consists of only a name, an address, and a "preferred date of administration".  the service is quite fond of using such euphemisms, presupposing such vernacular will aid in maintaining a certain level of discretion.  my own creativity comes into play when figuring out just how i'm going to perform said task. personally i'm fond of mixing up my methods.  who doesn't want variety in the workplace, right?  i didn't recognize this person's name.  i never do, with the sole exception of dear old pa-pap last time.  this time a woman, lving in tuscon, arizona.  never surprising since most old people go there in hopes of prolonging life.  cleaner air or something.  i read once that doc holliday went there to help his tuberculosis.  rather i didn't so much read it as saw the movie.  lots of these old people flock to warmer climates, electric blankets in tow.  those are the ones i especially relish working on.  i really hate the elderly.    album du jour:   urlLink   lenola       treat me to some life

      while on my daily sojourn to the post office and local library i noticed an inordinately large amount of suv's on the road.  my route takes me by the elementary/middle school here and it was 3:00, so i guess all the parents were picking up their respective johnnies and susies.  i really started to ruminate on how much i dislike suv's, not just for the shitty gas mileage, but just the trendiness of it and all the frivolity.  some people i'm sure really need that soccer-mom vehicle, but you know a great deal would do just as well (and probably better given the ever-increasing petrol costs) with a civic or something of the like, if they would just swallow their massive fucking egos and realize that material things are ultimately shit.  i hate wastefulness.  but maybe i'm just jealous of not having a vehicle of my own - like when you resented the popular kids in high school and chided and made fun of them to yourself and your friends (or in my case "friends" minus the -s) but really you just wanted to be one.  regardless of how much self-analysis i do i can't tell which i'm doing in regards to suv's.  but now i'm back in my hole, so who really gives a flibbedy flabbedy fuck.    album du jour:   urlLink   moonbabies       the orange billboard

      there's this girl that works at the local grocery store who i used to go to middle school with.  i don't think she recognizes me when i go in, but it doesn't matter.  i wonder if she's happy working at a small local grocery store in a tiny town, and i almost start to feel sorry for her that she's working at ten a.m. on a tuesday.  but then i remember that i don't work at all, and i'm at a tiny grocery store in a tiny town buying paper towels at ten a.m. on a tuesday.  how's that for self-awareness.  i watched  love actually  yesterday.  it's more or less a greatest hits collection of love story cliches with several little happy endings.  i'm not against happy endings, just formulaic stories.  formulaic anything actually (the music production factory known as  american idol  comes to mind).  and these grandiose gestures of love that have been used in movies ad nauseum really annoy me.  if i see one more person running through an airport trying to catch another person to profess their love i'm going to wretch.  airport love is so passe.    album du jour:   urlLink   ac newman       the slow wonder

      graduation ceremonies are just grueling.  the air horns, my god the air horns.  always signifying such a proud day for you and your family.  i liken it to fat, cowboy boot-wearing, bolo tie-wearing, ten-gallon hat oil tycoons shooting revolvers into the air because they struck black gold (yelling yaaaaa-hooo!).  the principal of my cousin's school gave an address in which she compared the graduates all to spinning tops ("you all are tops in my book" was in there a few times).  it was so embarrassing.  she even gave out little toy tops to everyone.  i just sat in my very uncomfortable seat getting more and more embittered with every cliche i heard the various speakers utter at the podium.    the whole thing got me a bit nostalgically depressed, remembering those days of relative optimism when you thought a college degree would ensure success and everything was going to be shiny.  and maybe i'm remembering high school as much better than it was.  not necessarily high school itself, but the outlook after graduation.  i was jealous, i think.     urlLink    the picture is a little blurry, but so was i urlLink     i had a dream last night that i was doing an impression of marlon brando doing an impression of barbara streisand for a bunch of kids.  they ate it up.  i was really good in my dream, but i just tried to do it and wasn't quite as good.    i rented  kill bill vol. 1  this weekend and i think i really like japanese surf music.  it might be my experiment of the week.    album du jour:   urlLink   shonen knife       let's knife

      my mom's visiting this weekend for my cousin's graduation (high school).  my parents always bring me dvd's when they come.  i recommend things i know tney won't like that i know i would, and they just buy them instead of renting.  i like dvd's.  also i got a european-issue double-cd greatest-hits-and-b-sides of  urlLink curve  in the mail yesterday.  for some reason i can't bring myself to take the shrink-wrap off of it.  i have no idea why.  something about the phrase "limited edition" makes me nervous i think.  in my last post i mentioned the jerry springer show, and oddly enough i heard him interviewed on  urlLink air america  yesterday.  he's actually very eloquent and has some pretty cogent ideas, one of which was making voting mandatory for all u.s. citizens.  and really it's not as bad an idea as you might think, or as i thought initially.  since most people who vote are the upper-middle class and corporate lackies and shills, the policy-makers end up only catering to those voting constituents.  this is also why you see politicians coddling the elderly during election times - old people have nothing else to do but vote and complain about health care.  if everyone  had  to vote then the politicos would have no choice but to actually act on behalf of people instead of corporations.  it's just deplorable that the people who need government-sponsored programs the most are the ones not voting.       album du jour:   urlLink   the apples in stereo       velocity in sound

      while flipping through channels i passed a jerry springer episode where this gigantic fat man was naked in a bathtub while five of the show's security guards were washing him down.  the title of the show was "bizarre stories".  on springer?  whaaaaaaa?  i would usually never even consider stopping on the show while channel surfing, but a lathered-up fat man in a bathtub was just too car-wreckishly fascinating.   i wonder if today will be one of those days we look back on in fifty years as a significant achievement in gay rights (coincidentally falling on the 50th anniversary of the brown v. board of education decision).  i think it's more about human rights and the separation of church and state and equality for all, etc. than anything else.  why are vertical improvements in civil rights always historically such a struggle?  hasn't "liberty and justice for all" been around since america's inception?  it's amazing how we can make advancements in our definition of equality but still continue to discriminate.  and not just on the usuals (race, religion, gender, sexual orientation), but more and more on social class.  it's all such a huge quagmire of hypocrisy.  and what does it say when u.s. athletes are advised not to wave the american flag too exuberantly at the olympic games?  probable bush administration responses:  - people around the world are afraid of freedom. - subterfuge?  that's not a word. - isn't it great that we live in a country where we can debate civic pride? damn! - if we are boastful the terrorists win. - we're sending the secretary of defense to athens. - hey look at the kitty!  look over there!     album du jour:   urlLink   the alpha conspiracy       aura

      my favorite people in the world, nicole richie and paris hilton, are on the cover of  entertainment weekly .  i just look at their faces and there's that old feeling of wanting to eat my own hand.  however it does make good fodder for bathroom reading - very pavlovian.  i try not to read my  ew  until my weekly shrink appointments on wednesdays because the reading material in his office really sucks.  and like clockwork he always makes me wait at least ten minutes before seeing me.  good thing i don't have abandonment issues.  sidenote:  i subscribe to  entertainment weekly  because i'm trying to cut down on my television viewing but i still like to keep up with things. savvy?  i sleep at odd hours, today it was from three to ten p.m. (hereafter i will refer to my latest period of slumber as "last night", just rmember that it doesn't necessarily mean i slept during the night).  i had a dream that my younger brother and i were astronauts and we flew to the moon on apollo 13, and wouldn't you know it the darn thing broke.  we did make it back to earth though, and we visited kevin bacon who just bought a new condo and had started his own trucking business.  we were hauling a load down i-10 in his brand new tractor-trailor, when he got out of the truck and made his way to the back to fix a rattling noise.  while the whole thing was flying down the interstate at high speeds, he fell off and was run over several times.  i woke up thinking, "wow, every time i go down i-10 i'm going to have to pass the spot where we killed kevin bacon".  what do you mean i gotta fight city hall?    album du jour:   urlLink   black box recorder       passionola

      i really can't be listening to talk radio anymore.  if it's humanly possible i've gotten more skeptical of absolutely everything.   i either want to throw my television away or lie in front of it and pull it down on my head, which, if you think about it, is kind of a metaphor for just watching it in the first place.  the politics and frivolity and intolerance and ignorance are getting to be too much for my little mind.  i just need to go to the library and check out some nice judy blume books and get under the covers with a flashlight and mister teddy.  back to the womb.  my fleeting fancy of the day is to move to austin because of all the cool concerts that happen there.  i would wait tables to pay the rent and become something of a bohemian (like you, yeah i like you, and i feel so bohemian like you, oo oo oooo).  maybe be a totally different person and give myself a new name; i like re-inventing, it's the best.  who's comin with me?  who's comin, man... who's comin...    album du jour:   urlLink   ned's atomic dustbin       god fodder

      my pixies dvd arrived in the mail today so i immersed myself in all things pixies, which really just entailed me watching the dvd.  it was very satisfying, although the included documentary called  gouge  was interspersed with a few live performances from the same concert that was already included on the dvd, so it was a little repetitively redundant.  and they had interviews from everyone in the band except kim deal.  but still, it's the pixies so how can i complain.  i've been hearing these really funny commercials on the radio for on-star, and in one a woman calls, frantic, because her house is on fire.  would on-star really be first on your mind when your house is on fire?  does 911 still work?  you'd think the fire department would come to mind in such a case.  nope, on-star.  help from above.  we don't need no water let the motherfucker burn.  we may be hearing alot about  urlLink this incident  in the coming days.  and honestly, i get much more nauseous when i think of some of these senators' reactions and comments.  and rush limbaugh is just a wretched excuse for a human being possessing no redeeming qualities in him whatsoever.  judge for yourselves, this is what he said concerning the beheading of nick berg:  "You'll see an effort to get the Nick Berg's family in Philadelphia to go public and say, 'Yes, if it weren't for the Bush administration, our son, whatever, would still be alive.' This is the normal procedure that the left has taken on such matters."  if you read that article (linked above), you'll see that the family  did not  want their son's execution made public.  it was, in fact, the state department that released the story (maybe to lessen criticism brought about by the prisoner abuse photos?).  interesting nugget of the day:  for every $3 we spend on the iraqi shimsham mishmash, we spend $1 on homeland security.  look it up, i promise.     album du jour:   urlLink   ash       meltdown

      an interesting tidbit:  yesterday was not only mother's day, but also the anniversary of the fda's approval of the birth control pill (44 years ago or so).  what a coinkydink.  this is how lazy i am right now in my life.  i have a book at the local library waiting for me, which is about a quarter of a mile away, and i can't make myself walk to get it.  not just because i have to go there to pick it up, but because i'd have to eventually go back to return it.  also when i'm on my computer doing whatever (surfing, spamming, identity theft, etc.) i avoid having to use my left arm to type with by saving various usernames, passwords, and other copy in a file so that i can just use my mouse to open it, then copy and paste.  that has to be very close to rock bottom - i don't want to move my left arm.  actually i'm just preparing myself for when i have a stroke.  and i know i can just force myself to do things, i just can't exact change right now.  also i've gotten addicted to air america radio, which i guess is good and bad, becaus it keeps me informed but also gets me very flustered and stressed.  yesterday i was even listening to re-airings that i had already heard last week.  why can't i ever get addicted to normal things, like heroin or pcp.  i could blog and bitch about politics several times a day, but i won't because i know it gets redundant.  isn't it nice that i think of my audience (both mom  and  dad)?  one last thing though, i don't think i will ever get tired of hearing paula zahn say "pull out" on a nightly basis.    album du jour:   urlLink   ben kweller       on my way

      today is the government-endorsed national prayer day.  thoughts?  i'm just going to pray to on-star, because their commercials are just great.  orlando bloom really looks like prince humperdink ( the princess bride ) in the previews to  troy .  i know the character paris who he plays is supposed to be sort of a charming, lover-not-a-fighter type, but mostly he just reminds me of an armored-up michael flatley (not that there's anything wrong with that).  he's been playing these lead-hero lead-romantic roles but he just doesn't convey that intended manly-man hero mythos, to me anyway.  he seems to always have more on-screen sexual chemistry with his male co-stars (depp, vigo) than the fems.   here's my prediction for the  friends  finale, keeping in mind i haven't watched it in about two years so i have very little knowledge about the current plotline.  but i did figure out the basic formula some time ago, so here it goes:  ross comes clean with rachel, who at first rejects him but then with about ten minutes left in the episode comes running off a plane or a train or another means of conveyance and professes her reciprocal love (audience does the predictable "wooo-hooo"s and cheering), and blah blah happily ever after.  joey eats something with tomato sauce, chandler says "could this  be  any more predictable?"  monica cleans stuff, phoebe (or "pheebs" as i like to call her) does a rain dance, and everything ends happily and safely, leaving the 700 trillion fans of the show feeling good about themselves.  and friday morning every water cooler in the world wants to commit suicide to avoid the chatter.  rumsfeld going on tv tomorrow, i'm giddy.  i'll be watching it drinking out of a big-gulp-sized jug of my pappy's homemade moonshine with a big fat cigar i made out of parsley, while going deaf from the high level of decibels blaring out of my surround speakers.  it's gonna be great!      album du jour:   urlLink   the cranes       loved

      this is how w's writers come up with his speeches:  let's take into account everything that has happened in the past four years under our administration and say that the polar opposite has happened, and we'll come out sounding rosy (the absolute best is when someone from the commerce department tries to explain how exporting jobs to other countries is actually good for the economy.  entertainment gold!).  do some fact-checking, i promise i'm not kidding.  and please don't watch the news, or at least realize that it is  all skewed .  we see the story as interpreted by the media, whatever their political alignment (or misalignment) may be.  observing the subject always changes it.  so read,  or watch cspan, because nothing you hear or see on any news network is true.  this is not me being cynical, take any news story and google it, or whatever.  find out for yourself.  something else that's interesting to do:  go on cnn and read any particular global story and then go on  urlLink al jazeera  (or any foreign news network, bbc, etc.) and read their story on the smae thing.  i don't mean to imply that either is more accurate than the other, but you can see how at least one is propagandizing the story.  who's to say which is right?  how can anyone be obtuse enough to believe that we get the straight story 100% of the time because we live in america and foreign news agencies spout lies 100% of the time because they don't?  and how much sense does it make that terrorists hate us because we are free and enjoy a better quality of life.  does anyone seriously believe that religious jihads are undertaken because of jealousy?  bin laden is (or at least was) wealthier than most of us will ever be.  i can't imagine he had a very difficult life.  why then all the hatred for america?  the people we went to "liberate" are now being referred to as "insurgents".  and another interesting tidbit - one of saddam's former generals (jassim mohammed saleh) has now been made leader of iraqi troops (you have to check out the picture of him  urlLink in this article  and the article itself, it's eerie).  but this is perfectly fine, i'm sure he was one of those top-tiered underlings of saddam that had absolutely no idea about the atrocities he committed (or ordered to be committed?), and was completely innocent of any wrong-doing.  maybe he's one of those "nice" former iraqi generals with a heart of gold.  "i was just following orders" comes to mind.  aside from the fact that saddam hussein was evil and inhumane to his people (and if that's our only rationale how many other countries can we thus "liberate"), i see no redeeming quality whatsoever in invading iraq.  there's that whole "region-stablizing" theory that we can't know for sure about for several years, but that seems at best flimsy to me.  maybe there's something i'm missing in all this; i honestly and truly hope so.  if anyone can offer some semblance of a sensible reason why any of this is going on please let me know, because i'm getting exponentially disheartened in our country as the days go by.   this is why we shouldn't vote for kerry:  he threw away two medals he was awarded for his vietnam service 30 years ago and owns an suv.  i know these aren't the only arguments, but it's funny how they're the ones you hear being shouted most loudly from the peanut gallery.  sorry about the political tirade, i needed it.    album du jour:   urlLink   french kicks       the trial of the century

      i think ralph nader is losing it.  i pasted below an actual open letter (not long) nader wrote to michael moore (from the nader  urlLink web site ) in which he ostensibly calls michael moore a fatass, not without a bit of sarcasm.  correct me if i'm wrong, but does it seem like nader is getting a bit insane lately?  i guess not being able to get on the ballot anywhere is making him feel unappreciated.   Hey, Michael, Where Were Your Friends?  Once upon a time, there was Michael Moore the First. He never forgot his friends. Come time for the Washington, DC premiere of Bowling for Columbine a while back, he invited his old buddies in Washington — gave them good seats and spent the rest of the evening with them. During his other movie's premiere, he affectionately recognized how much those old friends helped him and supported him after he was mistreated and let go by Mother Jones. He was generous with his words and time.  Now there is Michael Moore the Second. Last night he hosted the Washington, DC premiere of Fahrenheit 9/11, and who was there? The Democratic political establishment, the same people whom he took to such mocking task on the road with us in campaign rally after campaign rally in 2000. Who was not there? His old buddies! Not personally invited, not personally hung out with.   A few weeks ago, Michael, I sent you a message: "Hey, Dude, where's my Buddy?" It is  urlLink attached . It has gone without reply. It simply asked you to come back to your progressive constituency and take on the two-party monopoly of our rigged election system — to challenge the pro-warlike, corporate party with two heads, wearing different makeup when it comes to playing toady for Big Business. These are the giant multinationals who have no allegiance to our country or to communities like Flint except to control, deplete or abandon them. It is not that your views have changed, with an exception or two. It is that your circles have changed. Too much Clinton, not enough Camejo.   Your old friends remain committed to blazing paths for a just society and world. As they helped you years ago, they can help you now. They are also trim and take care of themselves. Girth they avoid. The more you let them see you, the less they will see of you. That could be their greatest gift to Moore the Second — the gift of health. What say you?

      today i am all alone, all by myself, no one is looking.... i was thinking of you (old green day lyrics - ahhh high school).  everyone else is working in cameron parish, so i'm handling all the phone calls whilst i download music and play scrabble blast on msn.  that's right, i'm playing games at work in my second week.  wanna fight about it?  and i can piss with the door open!  why does that excite me...  i can snoop around and take off my shoes and pump up the volume on my laptop and lip-sync all the live-long day.  yeah i'm gonna get fired.  favorite word(s) of the day:  chickenhawk war pimps (guess what it refers to)  lately i've been strangely addicted to dandy warhols music.  i've always loved them but recently i cant get their songs out of my head and really don't feel like listening to anything else.  and this concerns me because i really don't want to get tired of it.  i'll have to ration it out, interject some other stuff in between my listens and interpretive dancing.  i was listening to monkey house yesterday afternoon and i think my boss saw me lip-syncing.  not a big deal though.  early morning revelation:  lip-sync is the oppositve of karaoke  i wish it was friday.  i want beer, and lots of it.    album du jour:   urlLink   dandy warhols       dandy warhols come down

      when i look at  urlLink sean hannity  i really can't help but feel a little sorry for him.  he looks like he was one of those pitiful kids who always tried desperately to get their parents' attention but could never live up to expectations.  and now he has his own radio show, but mom and especially dad still think that he's just a bum.  they probably realize, like everyone else, that everything he says on the air is complete crap.  he's like the stereotypical son of a federal judge or other successful position who ended up dropping out of their rich private school to start their own backdoor casino and eventually turned to smack to deal with their feelings of inadequacy.  and after several visits to several methodone clinics, payed for by the resentful but dutiful parents, he finally landed his own talk show thanks to his dad's high-place friends.  and now little seannie still can't win approval from mom and dad.

      friday night i was going to sit around and get drunk here at home, but i was exhausted after work.  really all i ended up doing was cutting my hair, then beddy-bye.  saturday morning i woke up and cut grass.  by "saturday morning" i of course mean 1:00 in the afternoon.  the sky got very dark immediately after i finished and it poured down for a while.  it was nice sitting on the carport having a beer (or six) while it was raining.  i sometimes like to marvel at the lawn right after i cut it; my wondrous creation.  i went with my aunt and her friend to damascus, a greek restaurant, and had baba ganoush and hummus, among other things that i can't remember, and wine.  greek food is awesome.    afterwards they dropped me off at a friend's house and we drank some more, rearranged furniture, complained about bush, listened to some sonic youth, then walked downtown to see this band called elephant man.  i didn't think i'd like it but they were good.  or they sucked and i was just fucked up - mox nix to me.  somehow during the evening i managed to make new friends of three nice-looking girls at the bar.  i don't hit on girls, especially in bars, but occasionally i get in an introductive way.  god bless gin.  *postscript:  why do most girls seem to like those fruity-sugary-schnappy-sex-name shots?  i can't stand those.  if i wanted to drink a fucking hawaiian punch i could have walked to the coke machine outside the grocery store near my house.  give me tequiler or vodker (suddenly i think in ted kennedy's voice?), or something that makes doing shots a real ritual.  doing a shot of hard liquor makes me feel like i've accomplished something.  so anyway, i crashed back at the friend's place, came home, slept all day, and am now about to read up on some stuff for work tomorrow.    album du jour:   urlLink   afghan whigs       black love

      my boss was late this morning so i had to wait on the stoop outside the offices for him to arrive.  while i was waiting this really nice-looking female passed me to go up the stairs to the offices above ours.  she was smoking a cigarette when she passed me.  the last girlfriend i had was a smoker, and i found it disgusting in many ways - it got to the point where i started having a bias against all smokers.  when i saw this person though the smell really didn't seem that offensive.  so maybe my disapproval of smoking just stems from associating it with a really mean ex-girlfriend (who refused to chew gum to make her breath smell better - what the fuck?).  i actually used to be a smoker, and now relegate myself to indulging only when drinking.  how can you not right?  i wonder if i could now get away with being just a little intolerant of smoking, since i did quit myself.  eh, probably not.    album du jour:   urlLink   the daindy warhols       13 tales from urban bohemia

      my cat is not a good sleeping partner.   she came and jumped on me at 2 a.m. this morning and kept me awake until about 5.  i love her to death, but here's the rub:  - she generates alot of heat (and has to sleep right against me), and i cannot sleep even if only remotely hot. - she snores, that's right, snores. - i think she must have really active dreams because she twitches constantly and makes odd groaning sounds when she's not snoring. - like clockwork, at 5:30 every morning she begins bellowing for her breakfast.  tuna smells unpleasant enough, but even moreso in the early morning hours.  so i didn't sleep much last night and am consequently drained already.  but i love mister kitty.    album du jour:   urlLink   devo       freedom of choice

      doing installations gives me gout.  i don't like staring at lines creeping slowly across the screen.  there's this big map of louissiana on the wall in front of me and i'm getting very well-acquainted with its geography.  from behind it probably looks like a giant boot is stepping on my head - that's work for you.  i don't have an office yet, although i will.  microsoft sucks.

      i haven't said anything the last couple of weeks about this because i didn't want to jinx myself.  i'm not superstitious though so that really makes no sense.  yesterday was the first day of my new job.   me... job...   i maintain networks remotely and handle helpdesk calls and other brickabrack.  sounds wonderfully boring and aggravating doesn't it?  maybe, but after such an extensive period of personal atrophy it's a pretty cool thing for me.  i know it will get old at about eight o'clock tomorrow morning, but for the moment i'm revelling in my exodus.  the whole thing is not permanent as of yet; i'm on a 90-day trial, at the end of which i'll either be elated or suicidal (always a fine line).  everyone pray to the patron saint of lost causes (still johnny cochrane?) that it works out.  for now though, i'll just think of myself as one step closer to that great american median mythos i hear so much about.  next step:  back problems.  my new  urlLink sonic youth  dvd came in the mail, so now i'll have something to lay on the floor and watch before i lay me down to sleep (at a reasonable hour, believe that?).     album du jour:   urlLink   ben kweller       on my way

      i posted a letter from ronald reagan a few days ago that was sentimental and touching (i love to be touched), but i want to make it abundantly clear that i do not approve of reagan's politics.  of course there is respect for the office and deference for the passing of a fellow human being and all, but as far as policies go it seems to me that he was just another overly-clandestine rightie.    concession:  all politicians are clandestine by nature, but you have to compare the varying degrees.  i find that nine times out of ten the righties go much further over the line than the democrats.  while i'm making side notes:  democrats are not necessarily liberal, and liberals are not necessarily democrats.  so i was too young during the time of reagan's tenure to really give a shit about politics, so most of my opinion comes posthumously from information i've gathered recently.  i've been hearing nasty-sounding words like " urlLink iran-contra " and " urlLink iraqi aid " (please read this one, it's amazing).  all in all i'm not impressed.  and keep in mind, bush sr. was veep under reagan, and probably much more than veep in the second term when reagan's mental capacities were waning.  i could come up with a plethera of jokes about george w. and waning mental capacity right here, just insert your own.  reagan didn't end communism, communism did.  did reagan have anything to do with it?  his economic policies concerning the soviet union certainly didn't hurt the downfall.  but it seems that the u.s.s.r.'s economic woes came from the inherent flaws of communism itself, not from reagan telling gorbachav to "tear down this wall".  it doesn't matter though, since ronnie went on tv telling mikey to do it and it was subsequently done, there must be a cause-effect relationship there right?  nah.  but for us americans who only read headlines and look at purty pictures, it's enough.  reagan's a hero (who said hindsight is 20/20?).  but reagan is dead now, and there's a possibility that the widow reagan may now be a persuasive ally in the fight for stem cell research.  i heard  urlLink joe conason  say on the radio today that the conflict in the stem cell research issue is that between reason and stubbornness, or something to that effect.  doesn't it seem that reason and tradition are at the foundation of every political controversy?  think about gay marriage, anything religion-related, terrorism (and dealing with terrorism)...  if you really look you'll see these at the heart of everything.  then you have to really wonder why it is that people are so afraid of progress contributing to the greater good ($$$ maybe?).  i've said it before, people are terrified of change, unless they're getting it back from a hundred-dollar bill.    album du jour:   urlLink   the cranes       particles and waves

      i just watched  return of the king  and it is not lord of my favorite movies.  and i understand that there are  alot  of people who have very special places in the cockles of their hearts for this movie, but not i (said the blind man).  did anyone else sense homosexual undertones?  i got the impression throughout that all the hobbits wanted to jump each other's bones (one in particular).  too much drawn-out drama en route to a predictable ending (and i haven't read the books).  it certainly wasn't a bad movie, although i wouldn't have given it an oscar when compared to the other films up for best picture.  i really liked  lost in translation , with  seabiscuit  at a not-so-near second.  i'm just tired of over-dependence on special effects that ruins movies.  it looks cool, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't look real.    i want to sleep for six months so i don't have to deal with any more electionspeak.  i grow weary of hearing people's rationale for wanting to vote for bush.  "he's got balls".  how about that one.    album du jour:   urlLink   sonic youth       sonic nurse

      i only just read this letter today and thought it was moving.  it also fascinates me to hear from soneone who knows definitively that their days are numbered.  i don't think it's a morbid fascination, just curiosity.  a forewarning:  there are religious overtones throughout, so beware.   Announcement of Alzheimer's Disease  November 5, 1994   My fellow Americans, I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease.   Upon learning this news, Nancy and I had to decide whether as private citizens we would keep this a private matter or whether we would make this news known in a public way. In the past, Nancy suffered from breast cancer and I had my cancer surgeries. We found through our open disclosures we were able to raise public awareness. We were happy that as a result, many more people underwent testing. They were treated in early stages and able to return to normal, healthy lives.   So now we feel it is important to share it with you. In opening our hearts,we hope this might promote greater awareness of this condition. Perhaps it will encourage a clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are affected by it.   At the moment I feel just fine. I intend to live the remainder of the years God gives me on this Earth doing the things I have always done. I will continue to share life's journey with my beloved Nancy and my family. I plan to enjoy the great outdoors and stay in touch with my friends and supporters.   Unfortunately, as Alzheimer's disease progresses, the family often bears a heavy burden. I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience. When the time comes, I am confident that with your help she will face it with faith and courage.   In closing, let me thank you, the American people, for giving me the great honor of allowing me to serve as your president. When the Lord calls me home, whenever that day may be, I will leave with the greatest love for this country of ours and eternal optimism for its future.   I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life. I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead.   Thank you, my friends. May God always bless you.

      what is up with the names celebrities come up with for their poor children?  gwenyth paltrow named her baby "apple".   apple !  andre 3000 (outkast) and erykah badu named their child "7", which isn't even original since, of course, george costanza wanted to name his son or daughter seven in a seinfeld episode.  by the way, they don't spell out "seven", it's the actual numeric character.  jason lee has a son named "pilot inspector".  jason lee kicks ass though so i'll let it slide.  the always-greasy germaine jackson named his  son "germajesty".  you know, i'm all for creativity in all facets of life, but why put your child at a disadvantage right from the start?  kids have enough problems and giving them an effed-up name just ensures that their future monthly drug perscription bills will be staggering.   apple !  i had a gin-soaked weekend.  very unlike me of late to hit it twice in one weekend (or in one month for that matter).      album du jour:   urlLink   moloko       statues

I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message.   I don't work here. I'm a consultant.   I like you. You remind me of myself when I was young and stupid.   You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers.   I have plenty of talent and vision; I just don't give a damn.

You know the acronym behind your name won't keep me from kicking your ass in the parking lot.   Do I look like a people person?   If I throw a stick, will you leave?

      my mom was teaching a rollerskating class in the gym of one of my former high schools, except it was a college class.  i went with her to hang out while she was teaching.  i stayed in a storage room that had a bunch of sports equipment, band instruments and ten-speed bicycles.  for some reason one of my former managers was there in the storage room/space with me, making me nervous.  one of the kids in the class got a megaphone and said something about me taking up a valuable parking space outside, and that the only reason i got it was because my mom was a teacher.  the class laughed.  all this made me irate and i wanted badly to skate out onto the gym floor in my rollerblades and do physical harm to this person, but my manager held me back.  and a good thing too, since the student turned out to be a girl with a deep voice, not a male.  i would have looked rather foolish skating out to beat up a girl, especially if she turned out to be one of those miss-fitness-america types who could kick my ass.  i got even madder at the situation, though, because my mom didn't really reprimand her.  i think ashton kutcher was in the class.    anyway, i woke up from an otherwise wonderful rest feeling pissed off and depressed.  freud you suck.    album du jour:   urlLink   pj harvey       uh huh her

      yesterday i was forced to go to the mall to buy pants.  much kicking and screaming was involved - i detest the mall.  almost all the clothes at jc penney were on sale, but unless the clearance is 100% off i still don't think it's worth having to traipse the mall.  there are renovations going on there currently, and being that it was memorial day the construction materials were being stored in this big wooden bin in the middle of the mall.  on the side of this bin it said "please excuse our progress".  i'm probably being over-analytical, which admittedly i often am, but i thought the statement was oddly profound.  how typical that we should scorn improvement, and at the mall no less.  we want it now!  make it better now!  i need to shop at generic leather store number 5 now!  and i want a sunglass hut right in front, so i can impulse spend on my way out bastards!  is there a foot locker here or what?  where's my pretzel?  incidentally i have to return the pants today because i don't like them.  i should try things on, but i hate the mall.  buyer beware.    album du jour:   urlLink   the killers       hot fuss

      i don't like to post large quotes often, but i was reading an  urlLink interview  of the legendary  urlLink kevin shields  and thought this was fantastic:  "I think sometimes music has a strange parallel with the world. I think the world is about to go through a really bad phase. Well, put it this way: people on a political level and big business have been working towards a type of coup. The world has sort of been taken over by big business. It’s not one country it’s in fact big business that rules the world now. And no one has quite grasped that. It hasn’t been quite understood. And all civil liberties will be eaten away at a speed beyond anyone’s comprehension. In the meantime, music’s getting more and more about the spirit of it and the feel of it, so a type of genuine counterculture—which isn’t a marketing thing, but an actual real one—I think it’s just starting up on some level. It’s to sort of balance out the nastiness. The world is never entirely one way; it’s always got a strange balance to it, even if it’s not apparent. So, I suppose what I’m trying to say is: as bad as the world’s going to get in the next five years, I think music is equally going to become quite relevant for good reasons. The soul of music will be the most valuable aspect of it."

      hey cnn, thanks for all the in-depth coverage of the balloons that didn't fall. america really wants that scoop. the pretty, helium-filled scoop that we just can't stop staring at as they hover coquettishly above our heads, waiting to drop. why won't they drop? i need ballons, i must have balloons! i need answers! what in the name of all that is sacred is wrong with you people? jesus help us! oh, thank god, whew, wolf blitzer commentary. now i can sleep.  my only qualm with the speech was the stem cell reference. i agree that it's ridiculous not to further research on the matter, but he may have turned off a lot of religious zealots with just the words "stem cell". other than that it was gangbustas. vanessa and alexandra kerry were impressive.  warning: abortionspeak  while i'm on stem cells, something really angers me. first off it doesn't matter whether i'm pro-choice or pro-life; males don't really have the right to tell any female what she should or shouldn't do with her own body (although i can make interactive suggestions after entering my credit card number on certain web sites). the idea that aging, crusty white men with enlarged prostates try to pass legislation telling women what they can or cannot do does not sit well with me. not at all. pretty soon they'll be trying to say who can and can't get married...  secondly - so many are pro-life solely concerning pre-life and post-life (i.e. the eternal destination of your soul). it's easy to label yourself "pro-life" and try to protect the unborn but it seems contradictory to do so and then advocate the death penalty, and send kids off to die, and cut funding for the poverty-stricken, and make it more difficult for the ill to get treatment, and so forth. several neo-conservatives (prez included) pay so much attention to the unborn and the deceased but disregard everything in between. to vote for someone (can't say his name this week - he-who-shall-not-be-named) who claims to be pro-life concerning the unborn (with words) but is obviously pro-death in every other aspect of his job (with actions) is just a mind-fuck.  remember the scene in  war games  when matthew broderick made the supercomputer play tic-tac-toe over and over again faster and faster until it overloaded and realized it oculdn't win? that's what this does to my simple abacus brain.    album du jour:    urlLink  neutral milk hotel    in the aeroplane over the sea

      the following is an interview conducted by my friend  urlLink smash  of the daddy of the mack, the gellin' felon himself, god. since i do converse with god on a regular basis, i served as question relay guy. while reading,&nbsp;try to imagine the benedictine monks of santo domingo de silos (chant) singing in the background.&nbsp; and notice how god likes to refer to himself in the third person:  &nbsp;  Smash:&nbsp; How could you let this happen?    my child, god is indeed infallible. god does not make mistakes. sometimes, however, thy god does enjoy his nectar a bit much and goes on intoxicated tirades. you know, drunk-dialing vishnu at 2:30 in the morning, tryinig to get sexy-sexy mary magdalin to come over, so on and so forth. i know we've all been there (phizz i'm looking in your direction). well, one night god was doing jello shots with hendrix, innocently enough, enjoying a nice tuesday evening. little did&nbsp;god know that that nappy soil-smelling dickhole had dropped lsd into the shots (later i had buddha reincarnate him as a thighmaster as punishment - to let him think about what he did while betwixt thighs of sweaty fat women). needless to say, god was a tad out of it and thought it would be hi-frickin-larious to see what would happen if a gopher-hole enthusiast were made leader of the free world. god woke up a few days later and the damage was done. what can i say, my bad.&nbsp;   &nbsp;  Smash:&nbsp; What do you think of Christianity?    it does boost god's&nbsp;ego, but somewhere along the line the whole thing got convaluted.&nbsp; it was supposed to be a really bitching weekly party, you know, to rest on the seventh.&nbsp; and now you all have fucked it up so bad that you&nbsp;only have a tiny sip of alcohol and the only&nbsp;thing you do while on your&nbsp;knees is pray.&nbsp; what is wrong with you people?&nbsp; jesus...&nbsp;   &nbsp;  Smash:&nbsp; What is the meaning of life?    medammit, if i had a nickel for every time... the meaning of life is...     &nbsp;   ted mcginley sit-coms.    Smash:&nbsp; How sick, exactly, IS your sense of humor?    have you seen the charlie's angels movies? all me.    Smash:&nbsp; Is this hell?    back to the charlie's angels movies....ever seen them back-to-back? over and over and over and over and over again into perpetuity? can you imagine what that's like? if not just ask brando.    thanks god for sharing with us today.&nbsp;    no problem man, you guys keep it real.&nbsp;&nbsp;now i have to go find jesus to make sure he's not fucking with the mexicans again by showing up in chalupas.     &nbsp;  okay god, vaya con dios.    word to your moms.      album du jour:  &nbsp;&nbsp; jesus   and mary chain &nbsp;&nbsp; automatic

      alot of people don't know this about me, but i get&nbsp;my orders directly from&nbsp;god.&nbsp; that's right,&nbsp;god tells &nbsp;me what to do and say (if anyone wants to ask a question of the almighty just give me a ring-a-roo.&nbsp; actually just think of it, i'll&nbsp;text you the answer).&nbsp; i've heard that the only other people who possess this conduitive ability are david berkowitz and, of course, the president.&nbsp; i know, berkowitz said he got his orders to kill from a dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;in truth, however,&nbsp;berkowitz was actually dyslexic and really meant "god".  yesterday i was trying to make a monitor work and god told me to adjust the refresh rate, but all that did was make the screen go blank and then i couldn't do anything and had to completely wipe out the system.&nbsp; it took forever.   what was up with that god?&nbsp;&nbsp;was it punishment for&nbsp;downloading  the passion  instead of waiting for it to come out on video?&nbsp; being against the federal marriage amendment?&nbsp; accidently stabbing that homeless person seven times?&nbsp;   even though god does talk to/through me, very rarely does he say what's really on his mind.&nbsp;   and his english really sucks.     album du jour:  &nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink  forget cassettes  &nbsp;&nbsp; instruments of action

      warning:  i'm about to wax political.  sorry, but these days one needs to preach it up real nice now and then to stave off homicidal inclinations.  it blows my mind how the president can go on television one day claiming that the country is now safer as a result of its war on terror (whatever) and the next day have his office of "homeland security" secretary insinuate that the election may have to be postponed in case of a possible terrorist attack.    oh sweet jesus, orange!  run away!  run away!  another outrage i have is the following defense of our iraqi invasion:  "saddam hussein was a tyrant who gassed his own people and the world is better off without him".  yes, i agree, everyone agrees, right on, testify, amen, no one ever said otherwise.  but if we're so concerned with international humanitarian issues, and  that  is our only salient rationale concerning iraq (since the al-quaeda link has been proven bogus, man), then expound on the fact that our government refuuses to do anything but chat about the  urlLink genocide  occurring in sudan.  tens of thousands murdered and over a million homeless.  urlLink     i guess third-world african nations with few petroleum resources don't count.  it makes me physically weary that such blatant hypocrisy has no effect on public opinion.   ralph nader - it's great to be idealistic and rally for a third party, just great.  but it will take alot more than lambasting the flaws of the two-party system once every three-and-a-half years.  developing a serious third party in this country would take an immense movement, and nader, being no dullard, must know this.  so why only speak up during the presidential campaign season?  and isn't accepting campaign contributions from the groups you speak out against (the oregon family council for one - would kill all gays if they could) sort of a conflict of interest?    i'm sorry ralph, you're off my christmas card list.  no more bundt cake.  no more bundt cake for anyone!    album du jour:   urlLink   mellowdrone       a demonstration of intellectual property

      from  urlLink sfgate.com  -   Calif. Education Secretary Apologizes for Comment to Girl   Sunday, July 4, 2004 (07-04) 10:41 PDT SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) --   State Education Secretary Richard Riordan has apologized for joking that a child's name meant "stupid dirty girl."   In a videotaped exchange at the city's central library on Thursday, a girl asked Riordan if he knew that her name meant "Egyptian goddess."   Riordan, who apparently believed he'd been asked what her name meant, replied, "It means stupid dirty girl."   Some in the room laughed nervously, and the girl again told Riordan the meaning of her name.   "Hey, that's nifty," he said.   Local television station KEYT-TV videotaped the exchange.   On Friday, Riordan issued a statement saying he had "teased" the girl, who was not identified. "I immediately apologized to her, and I want to do so again for the misunderstanding," he said.   Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a longtime friend of Riordan who appointed the former Los Angeles mayor to his cabinet, said in a statement that the comments were "unacceptable in any context."   "We must always focus on encouraging and supporting children. I've known Dick Riordan for a long time, and I know that he would never knowingly or intentionally upset a child."   Riordan was in Santa Barbara to promote his summer book club.

      this is  funny !  it's a list of  urlLink recipes from the bush administration  for fourth of july food.  john ashcroft's (sing for me johnnie...) "simply bbq" recipe is essentially "cook meat, put sauce on".  every recipe is just the universal standard recipe for the dish, only with "freedom" or "liberty" in front of it.  i absolutely love secretary snow's "land of the free cole slaw".  here's one of the recipes, but seriously go read them all on the whitehouse.gov site, it's fucking hilarious.  incidentally, this sounds like something my stoner friend... not me, a friend... would make out of random things left over in the house while completely fucked up:  Dale Haney's Yankee Doodle Dandy Ambrosia Salad  urlLink     &nbsp; 1 container sour cream 1 large container Cool Whip 1 large can crushed pineapple 1 can mandarin orange 1 bag miniature marshmallows 1 handful Maraschino cherries (cut in half) 1/2 small package of shredded coconut (optional) 1 cup pecans (chopped)  Mix all ingredients in a bowl.

      the graphic field wounds and charred bodies of iraqi children weren't as gut-wrenching for me as seeing our "elected" leaders going about their flippant and purposefully inauspicious lives, spouting rhetoric (rhetoric here meaning outright and lazy lies), preying on fear and sacrificing lower-class families' sons and daughters for the advancement of nothing nobler than personal financial gain.  the best thing about the movie for me was that i was sitting in a theatre with people who were becoming aware of things that i was already privy to, for the most part.  and those people actually sought out this information; they weren't being force-fed it accidentally by local or national "news".  it sounds vain but sometimes it's nice to be among those who care about their world and seek out knowledge, as i try to do.  it's almost enough to give a cynical dick hole like myself a little hope.  everyone clapped at the end - my fairy tale.

      i'd rather not do my shopping at wal-mart out of principle, but i am a man (ha!) of modest means and am unfortunately relegated to doing so at the moment. grocery shopping at wal-mart is tantamount to being beaten with a bag of oranges (yes i would know). all wal-mart shoppers are mentally challenged - they all have to stop and hold up cart traffic so they can save three cents on corn niblets. let's not even touch on the parking lot situation. personally i never browse or impulse buy when i go shopping; i hate being there and flee as fast as possible after some succinct product-snatching. but what would be a nobler alternative to shopping at wal-mart? albertson's? super one? they're not exactly mom-and-pop outfits you know.  i also filled my new perscriptions yesterday and am very contented right meow, very contented. my paxil cr is good - prior doses have not had a noticeable effect on your humble narrator (apparently the new dosage turns me into  urlLink malcolm macdowell ). the xanax i'm going to save for the weekend, since the "controlled release" aspect of it worries me - i don't want to be dragging all through work. not tomorrow anyway. when i picked up my scrips from the pharmacy the girl behind the counter said i was a "lucky guy". let's hope so.  i gave myself a kickass haircut that i can make look respectable for work, but that easily morphs into a moderate mohawk upon request; i feel like a punk semi-super hero. yes, there's nothing more indignatious and riotous and punk-rock than a moderate mohawk you only wear away from the office. maybe if my boss didn't have such an affinity for fishing (and we all know what  that  means don't we my droogs), i would give it a shot.    album du jour:    urlLink  faithless    no roots   the song "mass destruction" will resonate with alot of people, the ones that read this blog-rag anyway. dido plays drums. me likey dido in a non-friend way. the website is very good.

      i'm starting to have nightmares about bush winning in november and huge crowds of religious zealots cheering and yelling and hating. it's like a scene from nazi germany rallies in my head.  how is it possible for anyone to attack kerry's war record? while kerry was in the mekong delta dodging bullets gomer was in alabama dodging bravery, duty and sexually-transmitted diseases. somewhere along the line he also managed to evade any vocabulary acumen, common sense, a moral compass, business savvy, motor skills (recall biking incidents and pretzelgate), curiosity, open-mindedness, self-awareness.... several other things i can't call to mind presently.   urlLink     every qualm i hear pundits and priests touting about kerry just seems moot. actually, calling their "rationale" moot is being generous - most criticism is at best a manipulation of fact and at worst (and most commonly) outright lies.  but we don't like reading articles. just give us headlines and purty pictures.  where input.... can't think for self... must... do... stuff... oh no! orange!    album du jour:    urlLink  manifold splendour    my night time career

      even though i'm only 25 and have never been to a foreign country aside from canada ("just going over the border for some french fries and gravy sir"), i remember well serving on a swiftboat in '68 with john kerry in the mekong delta. he spent the whole time crouching in a pool of his own urine with a blanket over his head while we did all the shooting. not only that, but instead of firing at the enemy he would hurl his fellow crew mates' torsos at them. this one time i saw him wiping his taint with the american flag, signaling the viet cong about american military movements, and smoking "marijuana" all at the same time. john kerry only killed women and children in vietnam and burned down villages he knew to be un-guarded. he also shot three of his own crew mates (in the back) and defiled their bodies by drawing faces on them and shaving their eyebrows. john kerry also supports terrorism, worships the devil, rapes kittens, and eats babies.    album du jour:     urlLink  dykehouse     midrange   no joke, this guy's name is actually michael dykehouse. i can't stop listening to this album.

      at the risk of sounding goth, here's why i'm looking forward to death. you know that feeling you get while sitting at your desk that you're about to keel over and put your head through your monitor screen from fatigue and/or boredom? never more. or the insatiable ire you feel towards an inanimate device that only makes a little sound (albeit annoying as fuck) once a day (or in my case seven times a day - i make full use of the snooze), provoking you to throw it across the room? never more.  i crave a  big  sleep. i want a permanent womb. granted, there's alot of good stuff you may miss out on when you're dead (as opposed to alive, to clarify), like food and drink and wine and women and song. but for me it all pales in comparison to some solid sack time. especially right now. and even all of that is just speculation - who's to say what happens when you die. but in all likelihood it's nothing. just unconsciousness.  and really isn't our life-long goal unconsciousness? from the second i wake up in the morning all i want to do is go back to bed. i also love drinking, not just for the skewed behavior and ability to have sex with girlfriends i may not really like, but also for the wonderful slumber (or blackout, call it what you will) that ensues. same thing with other substances.  we work most of our lives so we have a comfortable place to sleep and eat and shit. why be afraid of death? you're definitely covered on sleeping, and the other two become irrelevant (probably).  so why not commit suicide you say? because i'm an advocate of avoiding the path of least resistance and i don't want to be hypocritical like limbaugh. plus i really want to see that  urlLink ian curtis  movie when it comes out. not sure about jude law playing him.  fuck i am sleepy.    album du jour:     urlLink  the siddeleys     slum clearance

      remember the line from  as good as it gets  where jack nicholson tells those two people sitting at his table that "people who talk in metaphors oughta shampoo my crotch"? i feel the same way about people who use nothing but cliches or adages. i hate verbal cliches. almost to the point where i get physically ill when someone uses them on me, with serious intentions of providing insight into some problem or situation. using them in jest is fine; i do it all the time because they're ridiculous. if you're so fucking programmed that even your speech is derived from some teleivison show or movie you've seen over and over again then just don't talk. everything these days is just repitition. no popular music is really original. every tv show is derivative of some neilson-rating paradigm of "what sells". movies - how many previews to movies have followed this formula: " blank  had it all. a good  blank , a successful  blank , and a gorgeous  blank . until one day,  blank  happened. now this  blank  has to learn that  blank  isn't always what you  blank  of it". and the modern-day dependence on cgi special-effect bullshit has really raped the film industry. i'll say it again,  return of the king  sucked ass.  something else that really bothers me - people who think that their newfound appreciation of radiohead makes them complex and brooding. god  damn  those people.  i'm going  urlLink lewis black  today.    album du jour:    urlLink  midnight movies    midnight movies

      some very disappointing news today. my beloved  urlLink beta band  has decided to part ways. it's not from the typical bitter internal dissent that most bands break up over, just their musical journery arriving at its fruititon. there will be supposed solo projects that arise from the demise, and a farewell tour through the end of this year. if you haven't ever listened to  urlLink the beta band  please do yourself a favor and check out  the three e.p.'s , or any of their albums. they're all magnificent. obviously i'm biased, so i think everything they've done (since their inception in 1997) is fab.   today really sucks fat hairy balls.

      putting quotes around words makes them seem lewd. what about when you add elipses in addition? observe:  today i was "jerking off" with soap... the babysitter was annoying me so i had to "push" her... i was horny so i told my girlfriend to touch my "penis"...  yes, lewd. maybe michael powell should enact some legislation concerning quotes and ellipses. no punctuation for anyone!  i had an appointment with my psychiatrist yesterday and i finally got him to prescribe xanax for me. it's some sort of "controlled release" (did the quotes make that tawdry too?) xanax so i don't know what effect it will have. i hope i still get the nice wave/buzz.  controlled release...i must be  urlLink sting . yes, i am tantric.  since todays theme is lewdness, it's worth mentioning that  urlLink pisser  received almost fifty (50) comments on a post which included pictures of her bressesses (she gets alot of responses anyway, but much more with the pics). as such, i decided to see if the tactic would work for me as well.  urlLink    let's see how much attention i get. incidentally, i left a comment on that post as well, but it was in response to something else and completely non-boobie-related.    album du jour:     urlLink  comets on fire     blue cathedral

      would nurturing a fondness for alt-country make me a bad person? critics always seem to cream their jeans for it. there's a stigma i've always perpetuated that country and offshoots thereof are personally off limits, but lately i've been coming acoss several bands of the genre i think i like, in addition to new albums from bands i already like that take on a sometimes-twangy sound. what i'm going to do is to spend this week exploring some different bands and see what happens. certainly no loretta lynn apotheosis though, even though she gets wet for michael moore.  another thing about critics - when they make their "best of..." lists (at the end of years or decades or whenever) it always seems like the bands they put on there are only there to make the list look obscure and complex and brooding so that those qualities transfer to the critics. i have a hard time believing that all critics actually think that the records they cite are that good, because i know for a fact some of them are complete crap (and my opinion is, of course, law).    album du jour:    urlLink  rilo kiley    more adventurous     this is the album that actually got me thinking about the alt-country scene, if you listen to it you may understand why. great cd, good times.
