      Yeah, so today I wasted sitting around doing nothing, but wishing that I could do other things. I should stop sitting around not doing anything about it, but I don't know. Maybe this right now is just pms I don't know haha. I wish that whole deal with Brendan never happened. I really liked him alot, and as much as we all say this, he was different. He is different, I swear it. I was so so upset when he said we couldn't be together, but I didn't tell him. maybe I should have. I didn't want to put more on his shoulders though, so maybe i did the right thing? Either way, now for some reason he's upset, though he doesn't tel me anything anymore. so I don't know, maybe him and amanda got in a fight. Maybe his dads being stupid. Oh well. Moving on..  Justin pissed me off today, well kind of. Originally i was going to take a day off of work on the 12th to go to ozzfest with him. Now he was whinning about a hurt ankle, I told him take some painkillers get a brace and lets go. The he made the excuse of his mom was being dumb about it. He's just a talker i think, but then again I am too. I try not to be, but its just how things go sometimes I guess. I need to work on that.  I feel so sick right now, all because of the stupid period. Rawr guys should have to go through this. Then again I don't have to worry about boners or blue balls or any of that guy stuff. So I guess its all good.  Another 3rd of July that I won't be doing anything for. Darn. Oh well next year should be good, maybe charles, his friend and i will all end up throwing a party. If that actually happens where I'd move in with him. Who knows, I've got plenty of time to plan anyways.  I hate stupid drama. Especially people who just start it cause they want something to talk about and look cool with. so so stupid. Then again I don't know. maybe i do to..I hope not hah. Oh well.  blah I'm going to go take a shower and figure out something to do hopefully.  End
