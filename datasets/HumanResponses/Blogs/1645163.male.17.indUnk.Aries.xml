      ive been talking to michelle a lot its crazy weve met like twice but its all good cuz it sounds like she ACTUALLY cares. wow i know its crazy but it might be true. so i came home after havin an intersting convo with my morality teacher, i love that class.  i get very inspired. ive been thinking a lot about a lotta things and im starting to be happy more often and i still have my theory that anything that has ever happened in history has happened cuz of money and ppl being selfish. nothing has ever happened for any other reason with wars in history. its sorta depressing thinking about the world like that but actually ive learned to accept it!! :). so anyway after skool i came home and was dealing with comp problem bullshit but its ok ill figure it out and i gotta lotta shit to do with fixing up my room and writing thank yous for my bday along with act retake shit that i just finished. so ya that was my day i shall speak to you all later

      gReAtGaReTt: based on facts  gReAtGaReTt: back when ppl started off and im not bringing religion into this  gReAtGaReTt: girls had babies  gReAtGaReTt: and ppl in general had to start thinking more to do things  gReAtGaReTt: so their heads got bigger  gReAtGaReTt: the bigger their heads got, the bigger girls hips got so they coudl have the babies with the big heads  gReAtGaReTt: the bigger their hips got, the less physical they could be and considering that they always took care of the babies that they had  gReAtGaReTt: men always had to hunt and such  gReAtGaReTt: so men becam stronger as evolution went on  gReAtGaReTt: and hence y men are dominant  gReAtGaReTt: :-D  gReAtGaReTt: and another thing  gReAtGaReTt: taking into consideration that men became stronger as life went on  gReAtGaReTt: women could have been 10ft tall beasts when life started and men be like 3ft. tall weaklings  gReAtGaReTt: but just because women had babies they got less and less physical  gReAtGaReTt: and BABIES is y men are dominant

      gReAtGaReTt: ouch Austin Powers: Everything OK over there? gReAtGaReTt: my penis hurts Austin Powers: Did you get your penis caught in something? gReAtGaReTt: yes Austin Powers: Ha! gReAtGaReTt: jerk  everybody hates me, even bots make fun of me lol. im quite pathetic but NE WAYS i saw my lovely mel today yay score one for the team and also melissa who i havent seen in a long ass time i miss them... so score another one for the team... yay. afterwards i went with michelle to her dads house and her step sister is not hot, shes ok lol.... i like michelle much better. shes so georgous :) and im happy now about things, i can tell i like somebody when i miss them every second that im not with them and when i am with them i can be happy. another thing i love is that everybody that fucked me over or has treated me like shit is having a miserable life right now. I LOVE IT. they can all rot in hell... the phrase "what goes around comes around" is really true and being the o so very depressed person that i was b4 makes this seem unbelievable. everything is good, everything started going up when i got a car. and then i found michelle which is prolly the best thing that has happened to me in a while, i really need her right now n im excited for prom this saturday. i also just watched the beheading of that guy... fucking iraqi's its pretty gruesome but i seem to be able to handle shit like that... the one thing that pisses me off is that this shit happens everyday to ppl in other countries and where is the news about that?? everday we train ppl to go to el salvador and they kill, rape, abuse, and torture innocent ppl, if u dont believe me look into it cuz its true but thats not in the papers because we dont give a shit about any other innocent ppl but when some dumb asshole goes to a country that were fucking at war with and expects to be totally safe and ends up being killed we make a huge deal out of it..... im sorry there is something not seriously right about this whole thing.. PEOPLE OPEN YOUR FUCKING EYES THE US IS AS BAD AS ANY OTHER COUNTRY. im not saying this is a bad place to live because no its prolly the best country to live in... but if u dont live in it ur gonna be treated so unfairly by us that its sickening... were like the bully nation that beats up(dominates) other kids(countries) for their lunch money(natural resources). dont make me seem like a nazi communist or something but i just have hard feelings about stuff that we shouldnt have done and i still have pride for this country but i also know about how this country really is and i believe that is real pride. anybody can sing the anthem and say im proud of this country but they dont know the half of what really goes on here so its easy to just say words ( and i used to be like that ) and im sorry if i offended anybody but this is how i feel trying to be as fair as i can.... but anyway even with saying this with all of my hatred i am still so happy with my life right now... i just need a job lol.... i heart michelle!!!!

      if ppl werent horny there would be many less problems in the world such as no rape....no one night stands which cause many divorces and broken homes and..... no me acting like a total asshole for a short period of time that i horribly regret and am very sorry for. ugh the stupid shit i do to ppl i care about most. this is sorta why many things i "attempt" to do fail cuz of one time im a complete asshole about it. life always moves on but most of the time it isnt for my benefit..... i hope things arent like "most of the time"....

      what a day huh... im falling, falling fast down a tunnel of hope and then again a tunnel of fear. i guess this tunnel has been something that everybody has to go through all the time with every decision that has ever been made by anybody.the longer i go, the more scared i become. the longer i go, the more i start to believe that maybe it could be true? maybe not everyone is bad in the world. the more i believe the more i become scared.... so here i am spiraling down an endless tunnel of fear and hope.  i dont believe ive ever felt so truly.... happy? atleast i think its happiness, and by truly i mean not having my mind shielded by my horrid uncle's false curtain of "life" that was only there to shield me from the truth. did he really think "it" was that way?? or did he really think he could protect me from "it" when that is all there is all around me at every waking moment. i actually know the truth and for the first time since i have known the truth i think i really am happy... so once again in my life i can honestly and safely say i dont know... i really dont it does often come to this phrase ending my day everynight that i try to fall asleep. but in this o so very rare case it is a good feeling of i dont know opposed to a feeling of i dont know what to do so i want to give up... i actually like this feeling, i like her

      My life right now isn't exactly so tantalazingly ticklish. even for me having a decent life bad times come along. im in one of those depressed moods where i ask myself why im living and all of that good stuff. everything right about now that i had going for me is sorta failing me i guess. "i dunno whatever" are the words i always say even tho i dont exactly feel whatever cuz whatever i think means that i dont care even tho i do. i wish i could just move and start over with everybody and everything. whenever i try to get back on my feet it seems there is always something holding me back whether it be something or somebody and now its both. i dont think i did anything wrong but ppl get pissed at me anyway so iunno im just gonna relax and lay low for a couple days bye now.  PS. I still love Michelle with all my heart but things are just weird now

      yes, i am updating just to vent because i dont think ive felt this shitty in  a longass time, this day is maybe the most depressed day ive had since michelle i think. which is good i guess cuz it hardly happens anymore but its one of those days where its like hey i feel like cutting but im not gonna and ive been lagging on my pills bigtime i cant remember anymore maybe i should keep them by my keys or something which i will do right now. hopefully this shall help.  my house is getting over rated i think.... its not but then again i need a job to fill my basement and to pay insurance and to get the new car i want and the big system in my basement and and and ya i seem to want more then i can provide and i dont know why i have such a hard time finding a job its weird cuz i would have no problem working, i guess im just too lazy to go look around a lot. sometimes i can think about life and actually get a rush about it if everythign is good enough and then want to go do stuff, if only i could do that all the time. and im sorry that this update is the first in such a long time and plus its all bad news, well some of it atleast. everything is still pretty good tho me and michelle are great and have been since like the beginning except when she had those couple odd episodes of madness or something. but its odd since were practically married maybe i never had a gf cuz i waited till i found somebody that i knew i would work out with. but i guess its pretty lucky cuz my first gf worked out great so far well see what happens with this skool stuff tho hopefully itll work out cuz im happy with her :)  so im about done and i gotta get up to paint more tomorrow. well hopefully ill update soon so goodnight to pp or whoever losers read this...bye
