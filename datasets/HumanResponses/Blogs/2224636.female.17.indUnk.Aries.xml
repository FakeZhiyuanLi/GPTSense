       this is just how i feel   have you felt like you know you exsist in the world but no one acknowledges it?  yeah because that's how I feel right now.  it's really funny when you look at your e-mail and all you've got is spam.  not one thing from a friend.  or you try calling some one and then they never call you back.  you spend time with one person you love most in the world but feel like you're just taking up space this is just how i feel i feel like i'm in a world that knows i'm there but doesn't want me to be i would love some one to notice the things that i do or the things that i say  this is just how i feel

        Everyone remembers the 'faked-orgasm-in-a-deli' sequence from your kind of movie When Harry Met Sally. It seems that you're falling for a buddy or have already fallen for them. Uh-oh. You're probably caught between the possibility of having a great relationship and wrecking the one you have now. You know what they say, it's better to regret something you did than something you didn't do.    urlLink   What Romance Movie Best Represents Your Love Life?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       Quit Leaking DAMN YOU   You know what noses suck. Especially when you have a cold and no matter what you do they leak and leak and leak and leak. It's a very unattractive quality when the leak goes out of your body and nasty when it tries to retract itself into the back of your throat. And no matter what you do you can get it to stop leaking. You could stuff tissue up your nose and yet some how the liquid finds its way out or soaks the tissue to the point where it pushes it out. Then you take a bunch of cold medicine thinking that will help your nose b/c if I was a nose and leaking as much as mine is I would be tired of it. But no taking that medicine was a mistake because IT MADE IT LEAK MORE.  DAMN THE INVENTOR OF COLDS!!!!!!!

       Just a Thought   Today at my school during the last period they had this festival celebration thingy for the renaissance card holders (some gay program that makes those of us who don't have it feel stupid) and me and a couple of my friends were "left behind."  Michel and I were talking about random stupid things and some how we get on the subject of short buses. And here's that conversation: Emily- I've always wanted to own a short bus I think that would be so great! Michel- you know what I wonder about short buses? Emily- What's that? Michel- Why the numbers are like 6 digits. Emily- (confused) Um ok? Michel- No I mean like mostly EC kids ride those buses and most of them can't remember anything so how in the hell are they going to remember 6 digits for a damn bus. Emily- Yeah it's like the number is longer than the bus!!!  (LOTS OF LAUGHTER even from the teacher)  Best quote ever from a teacher- Emily you spell masturbation with a 'u' not an 'e' I think I would know.

       3.62 3.62 3.62 woo woo and buses   Yes that is my GPA. Which I am insanely proud of. Most people that are my friends and are in the really upper scale classes are like "Well I got a 4 or above." And I'm like "Well I could care less this is the best I've done in my entire school career." And run off giggling. Today was a good day. I was really happy about all my grades. Now maybe I could drive to school and not have to wait on this old fart woman who drives my bus. I wouldn't have to wait for a woman who waits until the entire bus parking lot is clear so she can turn the bus on. *eye twitches* It's really retarded like.  I said to my friend Hayley and also fellow sufferer of the damn bus driver while staring at the woman "I can not wait to drive to school THEN I CAN LEAVE WHEN I EVER I DAMN WELL PLEASE." *angelic Simpson like music plays in the back ground* Yes I have issues. I know this leave me the hell alone. Oh I'm in such a good mood. Well I'm going to go eat pizza and go see my boyfriend. YAY!

       A week ago   A week ago I had my son. A month early. It was so frightening I thought he might not live through the night. But he did. He's so strong to be so tiny. You never really understand was absolute true love is until your very first child is placed in your arms and you see that tiny life sleeping. It was so hard to let him go but  I know what I did was right and I know that the family that has him will give him all that love and the best life that he deserves.

       A confession you'll never see   All I've ever wanted in life was to be love unconditionally by someone.  (And no not by family if you have the wrong idea) One person in partcular. I would just love to have that person hold me in there arms again and kiss me. Making the world feel right again. But no, that person is gone. Doesn't want me. Why? It's great that we're friends and I'll accept that with time. But for all that I've been through and all that I've done, couldn't we give "us" one more shot? I always love the way you make me feel, the way you make me laugh, how you always say the right thing to make my tears go away.  You rushed right to the hospital with a moment to lose as soon as you found out it was time. You held my hand when I became to scared to deal with reality. You spent the entire time I was in the hospital right by my side. Wiping my tears away every time I thought I couldn't handle what had to be done. You were my sanity and my strength. Telling me what I chose to do was right.  You were there to hold me when I couldn't sleep. Calming me from my nightmares. You spent all your time that you could have had to work to make sure I was going to be ok. You even came home with me after everything was said and done and held me by your side so that I couldn't sleep. But no, that obviously doesn't mean as much to you as it does to me. I don't want to be your friend. I want to be yours.  Is it that hard to see you and I are supposed to be together. Or am I just crazy? I guess this is a confession of feeling you'll never see.

      I won't cry I know I won't die But seeing you now is harder than it ever was before I didn't want to leave I didn't want you to go Was what we did right? Was it nothing to fight? I feel a mistake has been made Soon it will all fade  But not now I don't need this Not ready to take that bow I just need you a little longer Just to feel a little stronger I'm not grounded I'm lost In a desert full of frost  I have yet to be able to cry It stunned me that much LIfe is such a crutch  Come back Right now I mean it this time No more arguments No more turning on a dime  If there was ever a time I needed you most I think it would be now.

       Wow   It's been a while since I've gotten on and written anything. Hmmmm well what to say. A lot has gone on in the past month. Parents found out I'm pregnant. OH wait no one knew that except me and Jerry. yeah so ok I'm pregnant. Having a boy. Going through the adoption process. Found out that sex can really fuck up your life. Due in February. Yeah I'm that far along. Had an ultrasound done and they say the baby looks great and healthy and that I'm doing great. Got a puppy for christmas and it will not SHUT UP!! It has these like psychotic moments where it just barks and barks for no damn reason. It's actually quite funny. I really wonder if anybody is going to read this? My dad keeps cussing at the TV because of the football game that's on now that is really funny. God you think for not coming on and writing I'd have more to say. Hmmmm. But I don't    "If the world hated you so much, you'd be dead by now"

I'm gonna stop acting like I want them so damn bad and just act like I don't care how they feel anymore (SKittles make sure I do this K??)   I just need to go out and have fun and stop worryin about be in a damn relationship. Fuck it I'll get one of those soon enough. Maybe a great one.  But G-d almighty. I'm 16. I had a son. I bounced back from that like it was nothing, even though it was. I need to go out have fun. BE A TEENAGER.  G-d, I gotta stop worryin over stupid shit. Thanks Skittles, I LOVE YOU.

       Both of you....OUT    OK so here I am smokin a cigarrett. Just finished talkin to Skittle about how shes confused about something and i try to make her feel better and not talk about my issues to her (for once time for me to listen). And I just burst in to tears. I'm still semi-crying.  I sit here thinkin about how much I wish I could be loved once again. I mean Smurf sits there one night while were talking and tells me "You'll always have my heart, and I'll always have yours." God how true it is. I mean him having mine. But will I always have his??   Then he busts out with "God, you are such a trophy to have. Such a beautiful trophy." Really am I muthafucka?? Am I?? THEN WHY IN THE FUCKING HELL DID YOU GIVE UP ON US!!?? WHY?   And why is it that when I told Pinz how I felt, he just went "Oh!"  If I'm such a beautiful person, trophy, whatever the fuck I am, why is it so hard for me to find someone to be with?? Why is it every time I fight for something, it goes further and further away from me?  God, I wish I could stop thinking about both of you and move on. Be truely happy? Why is this so difficult?  Both of you... OUT!!   Mood: So sad Song: More than a Woman by Calvin Richardson

       Somebody to Love   OK so I've been thinkin..... i wanna give my love to somebody...... yeah i'm fucking lonely.   *burn black smoke fills the sky*  I mean my friends are great and I love them but that's not the point. I mean there something inside me that's empty. Maybe it's all the rejection and heartaches I've had. But why I still want to love soembody I don't know.  It's like a void I can never fill. Maybe I'm just supposed to love someone for only a while and eventually move on to the next person. I guess I'm just supposed to be in a "forever" type relationship. This blows.  What am I supposed to be? I don't wanna be lonely forever. I don't just want friendship with no strings attached (if you get what I mean)  I mean there's someone I want but can't have. There's someone else I have feelings for but the feelings aren't returned. They are but not like I want them to be. GOD why is this happening to me.  I just want somebody to love!   mood: crappy and depressed like Song: Sick and Tired by Everclear

       Yeah I fucked up   So yeah a few days ago me and Hayley were in the car driving around getting lost as usual because we do that for fun. And we some how came up on the subject of our friend Pinz. I've discovered that I like him  a lot . *sigh* Hayley was like "Yeah you should call him." I was thinking to my self "HAHAHAHA yeah fuck that."   But being the person I am I got this thing call "spontaneous balls" and decided to call him.  *bangs my head on my desk* So he picked up his phone and this was the conversation we had... Me- Hey buuuuuuuuuudy! Know who this is?? Him- Umm *laugh* no. Who? Me- It's Emily Him- OH!! Hey girl. Me- So yeah I got something to tell you. Him- What's that? -I keep laughing like a dumbass school girl through all this keep that in mind- Me- Well that conversation we had outside and I said yeah you need more fuck buddies. Well I didn't mean that I ment that I would really like to try something out with you. I'm not saying like a relationship or anything just like go out or something. Him- Can we talk about this later cuz I'm at a friends house OK? Me- Yeah sure.  So later that night I called him back and tried really hard to discuss what had come up and all I fucking got was "You caught me at a bad time." I got off the phone and CRIED!!! I don't really understand why but I just bawled my eyes out. So I call up Hayley and told her what happened and she was like pissed like. Saying it wasn't right that he led me on like he did.  I should have seen it coming though.   But yeah I fucked that up. Now I'm like all wanting to call him just to say hi but can't because I'm afraid that it'll be all weird between us.  I really hate the feeling of having some type of feeling for some one and then they never return that feeling or they just keep it to themselves.  I really don't know what to do know. I do know that if I ever have feelings for someone again I'm just keeping it to myself unless they something first. I'm not going through this bullshit again.  Jerry being the sweetie that he is said he was gonna talk to him but I was like NO NO NO! I feel that if Jerry says something to him that he'll feel like he's trying to force him to like date me or something  UUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

       My letter   Dear Mom,  What in the flying fuck have I done wrong to you?? Why do you always look at me like you want me to burst in to fucking flames?? I know that I have made a lot of mistakes lately but I really don't need you to be my damn enemy. I am SO FUCKING TIRED of you looking at me as if I've been always doing something right. I'm so damn tired of you acting like I'm a fucking whore. Sorry to dissapoint you mother but I'm not out there fucking every damn guy on the streets like you think. I was stupid in the past but I've grown up an awful lot in the past 10 months. More so than you could ever think.  I know that I have had my ups and downs but when its the downs that I'm going through and need to talk to you about it all I fucking get is "Oh stop it Emily. Stop spiraling down you don't need to do that." I don't wanna fucking hear that. I need you to be my mother and help me the fuck out. Stop acting like you wish I was never born. Treat me like a fucking human being and not like a motherfucking piece of shit  And I really wish you'd stop acting like Crissy and stop treating me and dad like she treat her husbend and daughter. That's not your life sorry. Excuse me for not wanting you to pick on me and put me down every chance you get. Will you ever be proud of me again? Or do you just hate me that much. I honestly don't believe you will ever love me again. If you ever have.  I'm really tired of trying to please you in every way. So I'm done. I am fucking done. I'm not going to do it anymore.  Don't think that I have stopped loving you. You're my mother. You always will be. But I've lost all respect for you. Even though you think I don't deserve it, you should give me some respect. So to get respect give respect. I haven't done anything that wrong. Let go of all your grudges against me please. I'm tired of all the arguing. But unless you stop I'm leaving. I'm gone. I've got places to go and I'm ready to just pack my shit and go.   Song: Fuck the World by ICP Mood: SO fucking angry

      EMILY   VERSE 1 It wasn't supposed to be like this Another dose of unhappiness I gave it all and managed to get shot down yet again So I got drunk Had sex with all your friends You told me to never call your house again  CHORUS Emily, you saved the day Emily, when you threw me away  She was always such a pretty girl Nobody like her in the world A little piece of heavenly That no one else could stand I see her in my dreams at night I see you when I close my eyes I just can't seem to shake you, Emily  VERSE 2 You got your money and I got cast Outside thrown out on my ass In the city with no one else, no where else to go So I hooked up with this model from Singapore Emily, I sure am glad you didn't want me anymore  CHORUS  She was always such a pretty girl Nobody like her in the world A little piece of heavenly That no one else could stand I see her in my dreams at night I see you when I close my eyes I just can't seem to shake you, Emily Yeah  Emily, you saved the day Emily, you saved the day  Emily, you saved my ass

        It's Been a While Stained   And it's been awhile Since I could hold my head up high And it's been awhile Since I first saw you And it's been awhile Since I could stand on my own two feet again And it's been awhile Since I could call you  And everything I can't remember As fucked up as it all may seem The consequences that I've rendered I've stretched myself beyond my means  And it's been awhile Since I can say that I wasn't addicted And it's been awhile Since I can say I love myself as well And it's been awhile Since I've gone and fucked things up just like I always do And it's been awhile But all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you  And everything I can't remember As fucked up as it all may seem The consequences that I've rendered I've gone and fucked things up again  Why must I feel this way? Just make this go away Just one more peaceful day!  And it's been awhile Since I could look at myself straight And it's been awhile Since I said I'm sorry And it's been awhile Since I've seen the way the candle lights your face And it's been awhile But I can still remember just the way you taste  And everything I can't remember As fucked up as it all may seem to be I know it's me I cannot blame this on my father He did the best he could for me  And it's been awhile Since I could hold my head up high And it's been awhile Since I said I'm sorry

       AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH   You know I am just so sick and tired of being confused and lost and hurt. I'm so tired of being in love with someone who doesn't want to be with me anymore. I'm so ready to let go of all the pain that I have stored up inside but I just can't. For some reason something is keeping me in this state of depression I could say for lack of a better term.   I'm ready to just go out and be truly happy. I wanna smile and not have it be fake. I want to just go out and pick up guys with out feelin like I'm betraying someone.   I damn sick of being tired because all these feelings are wearing me the fuck out. I would love to find another person that makes my heart skip a beat. But not right now.   I wanna be 16 again. I know I've made right choices in the things I've gone through. I'm tired of feeling guilty about them. I'm tired of the resentment that I have towards someone that I love so much.  I wish my mother and I could have a better relationship. I wish that we wouldn't end up in a fight every time we just sit down to shoot the shit. AND I also wish my brother would stop looking at me like I've killed him inside. I've made mistakes I know that. But I've stopped dwelling on them. I wish they would too.  AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I JUST WANNA BE HAPPY DAMNIT! Why can't God just give me peace and happiness. What the hell have I done to Him that is so fucking wrong?? I do the best that I can. This world is all the sudden become  so  much to handle.   Stress shouldn't be l-i-f-e!! This blows. I wish things could be easier but unfortunantly they can't.  I guess I gotta take the punches as they come.   Song to tell the way i feel: It's Been a While by Stained Mood: So angry

      Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain by Willie Nelson  In the twilight glow I see her Blue eyes crying in the rain  When we kissed goodbye and parted  I knew we'd never meet again   Love is like a dying ember  And only memories remain  And through the ages I'll remember  Blue eyes crying in the rain.  Someday when we meet up yonder  We'll stroll hand in hand again  In the land that knows no parting For blue eyes crying in the rain.

       Why call me Beautiful?   *heavy sigh*  Yesterday I went over to Jerry's house to hang out with him. Well we're getting dinner ready and everything like and a friend of ours, Steve (aka Pinz), calls to tell him his sister is on the way home.  So Jerry and I sit down to eat and the door opens. And strollin in comes Meghan (sister) and Pinz and Blade (another friend). I saw Pinz and my heart little jumped. It was a weird feeling. I don't have that feeling with many people unless I have a very strong connection and there have only been a few and those people know who they are. If you have to ask you're not one of them.   But I think I felt what I did because of the past history that we have. May is a significant thing to my life (Skittle you know what I'm talking about) Back then things between me and Pinz could have progressed but certain events stopped that.   Anyways again, Jerry and I finish eating and so all of us go in to his room and start watching this stupid shit called Girls Gone Wild. The most retarded and pointless crap I have ever seen in my life. So I get bored with stupid bitches running around showing their shit, so i get up to go smoke outside.   Pinz comes and joins me. So I'm standing there looking around at everything and I happen to glance over at him. He's giving me the strangest look. So I asked him "what's wrong?" and he looks at me normal like and says "When we were in Jerry's room I was just looking at you thinking to myself how beautiful you are." In my head I'm like "OH MY GOD" but to him I said "Nah I ain't that pretty now." I look over at him and he looks kinda hurt so I correct myself and say to him "Thanks. that's sweet."   Then he busts out with "Plus I was just thinking about how much I just want to kiss you." so I say to him "Then why haven't you?" He looks away from me and says "Because I don't know how people will react if I do." So I say "It doesn't matter what other people think. You should do what you feel like doing."  We're standing there and it's deadly silent and uncomfortable. So I said, "You know I always wondered why you always look so sad?" and he responds with " I just don't know how to be happy." Then conversation progresses back to talking about may. I said "You know ever since your 'drunken confession' incident I've thought a lot about you." I don't remember his response but I do remember that then i kissed him. And he looked all happy for a split second =).   But see now I'm really fucking confused. I don't know what is going on with that boy. I mean if there's something that's there between us it really needs to be known. But nothing can really be done about that right now because unfortunantly I still love Jerry very much and still want to be with him.   I guess I just have to quit dwelling and take the punches as they come.

       I want to bang my head on the wall and SHOOT MYSELF IN THE FOOT!!!   Yeah so here I am listening to Bush. A good song yet I don't know the name.  But anyways! GOD i want to bang my head on the wall!! So I got home from going on an adventure with my homie Hayley (SHOUT OUTS TO MY HOME GIRL SKITTLES) She's so damn smart on guys. Well she's really cool about explaining on how and why Jerry acts the way he does towards me. Sometime I honestly don't know what I'd do without that girl. She's been there for me through some really tough times. I mean she's stuck by me as I lost my sanity when I had to give Joshua (my son) up. Plus she's been there to let me bitch to her about all the things in the world that piss me off so much. Plus she sits there and listens to me as I whine about how I hate Jerry but love him and how I get so confused. I swear she's been there so much for me lately that I would lay down and die for her just to show my thanks to her for being such a great friend. I hope that we'll be homies for life. I mean God, we'll be like 60 or older sittin' on each others porch cacklin' at the kids driving by saying "Remember when we used to do all that shit??" LOL   But anyways like I was saying: I really want to bang my head in to the wall because I was on the phone with Jerry today talking and stuff. And as we got off the phone I said plain as fucking day "I love you." and he says "What did you say?" I go "NOTHNG NOTHING. I'll see you when I get there for dinner." and he goes "OK whatever." I felt like such a fucking fool. Imean my God, here I am trying to respect our 'friendship' and there i go screaming out "I love you" because even though I still do I don't let him know that to the full extent because I don't want to run him away. I've made to many mistakes in the relationship we once had and I don't want to do anything to fuck up our friendship. Cuz honestly I truely value the friendship we have but I don't want to say anything that's gonna mess it up.

      Numb by Linkin Park   I'm tired of being what you want me to be Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface I don't know what you're expecting of me Put under the pressure, of walking in your shoes (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) Every step that I take is another mistake to you (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)  [Chorus:] I've become so numb I can't feel you there I've become so tired, so much more aware I'm becoming this, all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you   Can't you see that you're smothering me? Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control 'Cause everything that you thought I would be Has fallen apart, right in front of you (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) Every step that I take is another mistake to you (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) An' every second I waste is more than I can take  [Chorus:] I've become so numb I can't feel you there I've become so tired, so much more aware I'm becoming this, all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you  And I know I may end up failing too But I know You were just like me With someone disappointed in you  [Chorus:] I've become so numb I can't feel you there I've become so tired, so much more aware I'm becoming this, all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you  I've Become so numb I can't feel you there I'm tired of being what you want me to be I've become so numb I can't feel you there I'm tired of being what you want me to be

       I wonder   You know I wonder if I ever went and visited NWSA would anybody notice that I showed up? Or rather would anybody care. You know I left there with a sense that I would stay in touch with people, which in all honest I have tried to, but those people would stay in touch with me. I hate it that I lost contact with a really great group of friends. And they're reading this they know who they are. I'd really like to get back in touch with them again but it's like every time I try I feel like the response it "Oh her..." But hey I can't blame them for not getting touch with me they have lives. It just be nice to know how everybody's doing.  Sometimes I wonder if I'm ever actually alive? Lately I've felt so far away from this world. Like I almost don't live. So much has happened to me I guess that I've just shut down. I really don't feel any more. Well that's not true I just don't feel much any more. I rarely feel any true emotions. But I guess that can happen to a person when the two people you love the most are gone or don't want to be with you. How sad how things like that can effect me so much. But hey first love and first child what the hell can I say? I think if there was a song to tell exactly how I feel it would be Numb by Linkin Park. Funny. My life right now blows so much ass I don't know if I'll ever be truely happy again or if I'll be in love again. Sad how events can do that to a person. Oh well.

        You! HEY YOU! Yes You! Come 'ere!   Why is it that everytime we're together, I think everything is back to how I believe it should be? Why is it every time that you look at me its like you have something to say but the letters instead sit there and shake their asses at me and won't let you form the words? Why is it that I want to shake you and scream in your face until I'm blue? Why in the fuck do I want you?   I'm so sick and tired of wanting to be with you! It's like this uncontrolable urge to just need you. You, damn you, complete me in some strange way. You fill this empty spot in my soul. I wish I could kick my own ass for wanting you so bad.  Every time I wish to express to you how you make me feel I have to bite my lip until it fucking bleeds. I have to hold back on the things I know you don't want (or so I assume) to hear.  And yet, I'm still lost on you. You still hold me and kiss me and make me feel all good about myself. Yet you can't be with me.   I'm beginning to believe it's because you can't commit fully. You only said the relationship wasn't going any where because we couldn't move forward. WELL DUHHHHHHHHH DUMBASS WE CAN'T GET MARRIED!!!! Is that what you want? Is that what you need? You just want to wait until I'm ALL GROWN UP so we can commit like that? Well damn I'm ready. My foots about to step down. IS YOURS??? NO NO ITS NOT!! I'm so damn sick and tired of your excuses. BE REAL WITH ME! BE FUCKING STRAIGHT! Start remembering that you can tell me everything like you once did.   Being friends doesn't change a thing. You're the one who said that. YOU'RE THE FUCKING ONE WHO SAID  You'll always have my heart and I'll always have yours.  Well damn it's true. And that sucks because I want you. Not physically (although that's a nice perk). I want you mentally, emotionally, spiritually! I've had plenty of opportunities to connect with other people and I know you know that. Why? Because I tell you everything. You know more about me than anyone.   You want to know why I can't connect with other guys? Because it's just not there. That thing that I feel, it's not there with them. But with you, God, with you it's always there. Screaming and crying to get out. Wanting so bad to just run away but can't because you hold me in a way that no one ever has. You could let go at any time, any time you fucking damn well please but you just hang on. Hang on to those strings that are attached to my heart, my soul, my mind, my body!!! And it is fucking killing me.   I wonder is that why you haven't gone and found any body else like you did the last time? Is that the reason you don't date? Is that the reason you won't fuck anyone else?? Because you hold every string that surrounds my every being?  Why is it that every time something happens to me you forever say you're sorry? What's the reason behind that? Or is there? You kill me with your kindness. You kill me with your touch. It pains me inside.   Yet you make me laugh. You make me feel. You make me complete! There's not a damn doubt in my mind that we could make this work. But I know that we need time. Time to be friends. Time to just chill. Just know that it is so hard for me.

       YOU! LETTERS! STOP SHAKIN UR ASS AT ME!!   I'm just a little frustrated right now. Not pissed off but not happy. Ever had one of those days. Here let me explain.  Ever since Jerry and I broke up there have been a lot of things on my mind. Just questions I need clarified. I want to move on from him. So bad. Because it hurts me some to still be in love with him. Yes, I openly admit to everyone that I've told I'm done with him I don't need him, I lied. I'm pretty sure Skittle saw right through my fuckin lie. DAMN YOU J/K LOL  But its like... damn boy you've got me confused outta my mind. I mean we're homies. Always and forever will be. But I mean you were or are the one who wants to be  JUST  friends. You're the one who asked for it. So to make you happy I gave you that. I respect that.    Yet when ever I go over there to chill or we go and hang out some where. No one could guess we ever broke up and that we're just friends. And for once it's not me initiating all the kissing and hugging and holding hands and everything that goes along with relationships.   I mean we go out in to public and he walks like there's only one inch of space between us. Our hands might accidentally brush and he grabs mine and holds it. He sees a guy checking me out, arm instantly goes around my waist. More intimate than the shoulders I believe. We sit there and joke around and he kisses me and hugs me. How the fuck am I not to be confused.  Now tell me this y'all. When you go to a friends house do you end up holding their hand? Or if y'all are like lying down on the couch does the person put his or her head on your chest and wrap their arms around you? No I don't think so.  Because you're just friends.   Jerry doesn't even act like we're friends. And get this when I try to act like  just  friends he gets offended. When he calls me "baby" or "sexy" (names he's called me for like ever and a day) and I jokingly tell him not to he gets kind of upset.  Then when he heard that I was going to the prom this year and NOT by myself he seemed to be hurt and offended. When he knows that I want him to take me to my Senior prom. The year that means the most. I want to share that with him because he's special to me. Not this year. This year is like the "get ready for the senior prom" prom. Ya know?  I just need to know why he's acting like this. My girl Skittle has told me her opinion on this situation time and time again because she's like a female Jerry (take no offense to that homie). But it's like its not clicking.  And when he and I are alone he just keeps looking at me like he desperatly needs to say something but can't. And no its not "I love you" he tells me that anyways. But its like he opens his mouth to tell me something and the letters ARE RIGHT THERE ON HIS LIPS JUST SHAKING THEIR ASSES AT ME!! Like they're saying "YOU'RE NEVER GONNA KNOW! YOU'RE NEVER GONNA KNOW!!" Oh it pisses me off.  Damn boy, if there's something you need to tell me JUST FUCKING SPIT IT OUT!!!!!!!

       WOW!! ME? REALLY?   Yesterday just had to be about the best day in the fuckin world. I was at lunch with my friend Brandon turns to me and says "Would you like to go to the prom with me?" I was like "Are you being serious?" cuz sometimes I can't tell with him. He nods and says "YES!" I was like "Well damn ok!!!" and then goes on to say we're wearing pink I WAS LIKE NO NO SIR THATS A NEGATIVE!! Then he suggests orange so I agreed to that. I already found the prom dress I want and everything. OK WHY THE FUCK AM I SO HAPPY. What makes it even better is that my homie skittle will be there too!!!! WOOP WOOP! WHO'S YA DADDY BITCH!!!!!!????

             you are deeppink  #FF1493         Your dominant hues are red and magenta. You love doing your own thing and going on your own adventures, but there are close friends you know you just can't leave behind. You can influence others on days when you're patient, but most times you just want to go out, have fun, and do your own thing.  Your saturation level is high - you get into life and have a strong personality. Everyone you meet will either love you or hate you - either way, your goal is to get them to change the world with you. You are very hard working and don't have much patience for people without your initiative.  Your outlook on life is very bright. You are sunny and optimistic about life and others find it very encouraging, but remember to tone it down if you sense irritation.         urlLink the spacefem.com html color quiz

       STOP! JUST STOP!   OK listen up people. I am damn sick and tired of people bitchin about shit they want but don't have the balls to get. Look, this is what I have to say.  1.) To all those who love somebody or want to be with someone: walk up to the fucker and tell them how you feel tell them you'd like to give you two a shot. Hell it could be an ever lasting relationship. But you might get rejected and feel like a fool. So what! At least you've accomplished something  2.) To all those in a petty argument with someone you care about: STOP! JUST STOP! That petty shit you're arguing about is not worth it. Trust me I know. It could end something great.  3.) To all those with hate in your hearts: It's time to let go. Just let all the hate go. It's more than likely making you an angry person. Sad on the inside. You're hurting others as well. Stop. There's no reason to feel that way. Stop being negative start being positive  4.) To all those who are scared: Don't be. As some one once said "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself" words to live by. If there's something that scares you to death. Face it. Own it. Take charge and over come what you fear the most. Whether it be telling someone how you feel, standing up to a bully, becoming a new person. Its time to face our fears  5.) To all those "pimps and playas": Quit. It's time to straighten up. Be a one man or one woman person. This playin around on one another needs to stop. It spreading hatred, disease, and hurt. It's time to love each other.  6.) To all you racists: Even though you people disgust me, it's time for a change. We all need to get along. Love one another. You guys are scared.

       ::BAM:: BITCH!!!!   So yeah. After I got all the shit I had to done I tried to lay down to take a nap but instead got kidnapped by smurf because he wanted to take me out for my birthday TWO DAYS EARLY LOL!!  So anyways..... this bitch at the place we were eating was an old "friend" if you can call her that was there. She knew that I was pregnant and asked if we had any pictures with us. She saw it and said "awwww he's so cute" then she left.  I walked out to the car because I left my cigarretts there and overheard her on her cell phone saying to someone "OMG the baby is like so ugly." I was so outraged that I walked up to her and just ::BAM:: my fist flew into her face. I just started screaming out all the profanities in the world at her. It pissed me off so damn bad. I mean yes i know that she's a two faced bitch but NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE YOU NEVER AND I MEAN    NEVER  TALK ABOUT MY SON IN ANY NEGATIVE WAY!   I walked back in the resturant and sat down. Smurf looks at my face and asked what did you do? I shook my head and told him not to worry about it.  But god I was so damn mad   Mood: SO PISSED but yet happy Song: Fuel ~ Metallica

      SIMPLE MAN Lynard Skynard    Mama told me when I was young  "Come sit beside me, my only son  And listen closely to what I say  And if you do this it will help you some sunny day"  "Oh, take your time, don't live too fast  Troubles will come and they will pass  Go find a woman and you'll find love  And don't forget, son, there is someone up above"  chorus: "And be a simple kind of man  Oh, be something you love and understand  Baby be a simple kind of man  Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can"  "Forget your lust for the rich man's gold  All that you need is in your soul  And you can do this, oh baby, if you try  All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied"  chorus  Oh yes, I will "Boy, don't you worry, you'll find yourself  Follow your heart and nothing else  And you can do this, oh baby, if you try  All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied"  chorus  Baby, be a simple, really simple man  Oh, be something you love and understand

       Simply Beautiful   I had just finished my Junior Exit. I absolutly hated writing that paper! I mean I had no input in it whatsoever. Our teacher wanted us to write the paper as if it was a Senior exit. So basically that meant lots and lots of note cards of what other people thought. It was gay. Just as I had finished this song came on. Simple Man by Lynard Skynard. My brother had followed me in to the room to read my paper but we just sat there instead. I was stunned. The song was simply beautiful. I was about in tears. Ya know everybody has a song that just makes them feel such compassion for what the song is talkin about. I was almost in tears. It was just that good. After the song was done me and my brother let out our breath at the exact same time. I think I didn't breath through almost the entire song. Damn.

       UGH! BUT WHY NOT???   Today was OK but awful at the same time. My home boy Smurf decided to pick me up after school today. Nice surprise. We went to go and chill at his house. We started to wrestle and shit and he was playing and put his hands around my neck. I fuckin flipped out. I started screamin and crying for him not to hurt me and called him by and ex's name. The ex was extremely abusive. I took all the strength I had and pushed him away from me and locked myself in the bathroom still screamin the ex's name tellin him to stay the fuck away from me.   After about five minutes that I had locked myself in the bathroom room. Smurf unlocked the door and came in. I hid my face and tried my best to hide in the corner. I was so terrified. Smurf bent down and wrapped his arms around me telling me that he would never hurt me like my ex did. He told me that he could never hurt me in that way. Ever. He asked me why I couldn't look at him and I started to cry harder and told him that I was afraid to for the chance I might see my ex's face. He then made me look at him and said "Khaos, you know that I love you so much and would never hurt you. You know that. I could never bring myself to hitting you. Please, please, I'm begging you to stop crying. It tears me apart when you do."   He wiped away my tears and held me close to him. All the while I was thinking to myself "God. But why not? Why couldn't we just be together again?" I'm trying so damn hard to let it go. To let him go but no matter what I do he invades my thoughts.  All I want is for him to be happy. I want to be happy as well. But I can't see my future with out him sometimes. Then other times I'm just like UGH I HATE YOU SO DAMN MUCH I'M GLAD WE'RE OVER!!   N-E Ways....  Smurf and I went to his dads house and told him about Joshua (our son). He didn't yell. Didn't cry. He just looked at the pictures and all I could see was disappointment. In what I really don't know. But it felt awful. I hated it. I guess it was because Joshua wouldn't be around for everyone to see grow up. But I don't feel bad about it at all. I know that my son is in a loving home with beautiful happy people. I know that he's going to get everything that I couldn't or can't give him.  I did what I did out of extreme love for my son. I wanted him to be happy, healthy, and loved without the suffering that I would've had to go through if I chose to keep him.  Smurf's mom is making me feel alittle guilty that she wasn't there. But I didn't want her there. Sometimes I wish Smurf had never told her. Because she told me that her sister couldn't have children and would have adopted him herself. But not to sound extrememly terrible I didn't want to have Joshua where I could get him. It would still be too damn painful. Her side of the family is saddened that they couldn't get to hold him and they're trying to get me to set up a date for them to. I told his mother no that I couldn't and wouldn't do that. It's not that type of adoption.   I don't think anyone understands that  I  want to hold my son again. That   I  want to see him again. And I don't know if that will happen again until he's 18. Or when he's ready. I will not force anything upon his parents to make them or myself happy. His mother was a little saddened by my desicion but I'm sorry she'll just have to get over it.  I wish I could leave this town. I just want to get away from it all for awhile. I need to. I've told my dad this time and time again. But he tells me not to because then he'll think he's done something to make me do that. But it's not him. It's not anyone. It's just me. I just need to get away from my thoughts and the pain that I have. The pain where I can't have my son with me and the pain that I can't be with the one I love the most with all my heart and the pain that mother can't seem to stand to have me around. I'm ready for it all to be over. I'm done. It's like I can't take much more of this. If I stay here another week I'm going to break down mentally and just go insane. I mean the real insane not the funny kind.   Mood: Terrible Song: My Immortal

       I CANNOT TAKE THIS   My mom has driven me to the brink off my sanity. I'm about to go off the fucking edge. I have to get out of this town. I have to get out of this house. Away from her. I hate to leave my dad and brother. But I cannot take this. I can't take the bitching, the naggin, the whining, from her. I cannot stand her saying that she's "so tired of my bullshit." When I haven't done a damn thing to her. God how I wish she'd disapper out of my life for good. Not die just disapper. I can't take her anymore. I can't stand her face. I can't stand her presence. I hate it when she tries and makes me feel guilty about the mistakes I have made. I want so bad to hit her in the face, pack her shit, and tell her to fuckin leave. Me and my dad would be happier I know. I'm so sick of her telling my dad he can't do anything right. He doesn't make her happy. Then when she wants something she acts all sweet like and shit. I CANNOT TAKE THIS.....I'M GONE I'M DONE I'VE FUCKING LOST IT

That was borin as fuck until somebody fell on their head.   I walked up to Dollar General and I was lookin around and heard "Howdy Howdy." I laughed because I knew it was Jerry. While I was checkin out at the counter he kept lookin over the isle where you can see and the top and smilin at me and shit. It was great. Guess that stupid bitch he was chillin with yesterday wasn't good enough. LMFAO But I walked up to him and asked him how he was and that I had pictures of Josh (New ones) that he just had to see. Then I gave him a note. Starting off with "WHAT! YOU CAN'T CALL NOBODY???!!!" LOL  Told him we needed to get together and chill and shit and he said yea sometime next week.  OH WELL!

Then I told Skittle I couldn't remember the drive to my house. And we had a little freak out moment because we both couldn't remember.

       OK so yeah a little depressing.... sorry    Today I got home and started to listen to "My Immortal" and  cried like a fucking baby!!!!!  I just started to think (for once not about Jerry or Pinz) but about my son. You know its not like I want the memory of him to go away but I miss him so much. And I would've absolutly love to wipe away all of his tears and chase away all of his fears and hold his hand throughout the years to come. But I can't do that. I know what I did was right for him. I know that he will get the life and all the love he deserves. But no one will ever ever love him as much as I do! Not even Jerry. A mothers love cannot compare with anyone elses that they will feel for their child. I'm dying to hold him again. I've been told that he's getting bigger and stronger every day. I know that he's healthy. I know that he's alright. But to see him again will bring my spirits way way up. To all of you that are reading this, I know that you don't know how I feel right now you can't really understand, but to the future mothers when you go through all the 9 months of back aches stomach aches and everything else and then that tiny little life comes out of you and you hold him/her for the first time you will understand the feelings that I have. You will never want to let him/her go. You will promise so many things to him/her. You'll cry because you're so damn happy. To the future fathers out there, being with your wife as she goes through this will be hard but when it come to the end of it, and you see that person that you created i don't think you won't help but to shed a tear. I know Jerry did.  ::Mood- Happy but sad Song: My Immortal::

             I'd like to smile and for once completely mean it     I'm tired. I'm tired of so many things. You know I've never really confessed that I hate my mom and dad for making me give up my son. In actuallity it wasn't my choice. It was there. And that hurts. I mean damn, they made me give up my first born. I don't think anyone can even imagine how much that hurts. The anger that I hold so far back in my mind is dragging me down.   I sick of acting like I'm 13. I tired of acting like and idiot and not just ask that person out. I wish I could but I can't because I don't really think he'd say yeah. I mean he might but would it because he doesn't want to hurt my feelings or would it be because he actually wants to?   I'm really tired of every time I try to have a  decent  conversation with my mother we argue. It's like we can't act decent. I mean yeah there are those days that we get along and ladida but most of the time we're arguing over stupid ass things. OMG it's really ridiculous.  I'm honestly ready to just be happy. I want to smile and not feel like I'm being fake. I want to laugh and not think of bad things. I want my thoughts to be clear. I want to just be free of the pain and the hurt and the damn anger. I want so damn bad for every ounce of confusion I have in me to be gone. I'd like to just feel rested. I don't want to be paranoid of everyone around me. I don't want to feel like I'm being judged all the time.   Sometimes I just feel like I'm being held back. Things are just keeping me down. God, now I realize why I did drugs. Why I drank. Because I didn't have to feel. I didn't have to think. But I guess it's time for me to face all those things and just deal. But I don't want to to be honest. I'd just like to run away from it all. Give up. Not care. But all the thoughts are invading my head. I'm just so tired of it all.      Mood: Lost Song: Fortunant Son~ CCR

              OOOOO! AHHHH! I DON'T FUCKING CARE!!     Man, my feelings right now are just hurt. I called over to Jerry's house because I'd like to hang out with him. Well gee, DENIED!!! He's all the sudden become to fucking busy to hang out with me. BUT he can hang out with Korie and Stephanie?? WHAT IN THE FLYING FUCK???? He's all like "Well I gotta work you know??" UM YEAH I KNOW THAT I'M NOT STUPID!! Gawd but he doesn't understand that I'd like to hang out with. I have pictures of his son to see but damn you know what he says? "When I have the time." WHEN HE HAS THE FUCKING TIME!!! That really hurt to hear. It really hurts that he'd rather go smoke up and go to some god damned flea market to help sell shit that none of the damn profit is going to him than just chill with me. It makes me want to cry. I mean he's going to be gone for like three days and he can't chill with me for two hours. OH I'M SORRY I'M ATTEMPTING TO TAKE UP SOOOOOOOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME!! Shit now I'm crying because I'm so frustrated. Damn it! You know I'm really glad that we aren't together because it'd just be all heart ache and shit. I'm so tired of it. I'm so tired of his bullshit. You know I'd just like to be happy. But everything around me is like saying NOPE SORRY!!! YOU'RE GONNA BE MISERABLE FOREVER!! I'm tired of being denied, rejected, pushed away, hurt!! I'm so tired of all that bullshit. I just want it to end. End now! I can't take all that crap from him, I can't take the confusion I have over some matters, I can't get away from the thought of failing this really important ap exam, I'm ready for it to be over.......... now. It makes me sick that I have all this stupid stupid bullshit in my life making me so down. God and you know what's even more retarded to pile more shit on?? Acutally I don't want to write about it.

             The crowd is dragging me through the mud and spitting in my face!!      Well Monday is going to be hell for me. I have to go aalllllllllll the way to the West campus of CPCC to take the stupid English AP exams. At least I don't have to be in school that day like AT ALL!!!! WOO WOO!  I don't understand but all this week I have been feeling simply drained. Like I have no energy AT ALL! I don't really understand why. Maybe its because I'm PMSing (yeah yeah TMI) Or maybe its just I have no energy.  Today I get to go and get this spray on tan for me. It's so I won't be so damn white when I go to the prom. *I'M SO WHITE I GLOW BABY* Then I get to go get my shoes for my dress. Which you won't even see because my dress is long. OH MY GOD! My dress is simply gorgous it's black and pink. It kinda fitted in the top to show off my figure just enough and then it goes out just a little bit. It solid  black  with this bright strip of hot hooker  pink  across the top and then the flowers and vines cascade down the dress in  pink  as well. I LOVE IT!!  Ha! That reminds me. I was talking to my friend Stacey on line last night and I told her about the spray on I was getting and she said to me "Have you no shame?? Us females work hard at laying down in those 100000000 degree tanning beds to get this dark and you're cheating!!! Cheating by getting a tan sprayed on!! You so suck you know that right??" I said to her "OK you know that shame does not run in my vocabulary. So no I'm not ashamed of cheating. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M EMILY! SO BOOYAH!!" and we laughed and laughed and it was funny.  Ugh! Damn it! I was about to ask Chris out at lunch today but NO!!! The words wouldn't form. They sat there on my lips shakin their asses at me and laughing.  I just noticed I have heart burn and it hurts. LOL      Mood: In pain but happy but drained as well (oooo too many emotions) Song: Want you to want me

             I'll just say whatever falls out      OK. So I told you I like you. I'm kind of regretting that I've told you now. I mean damn I know that Skittle is kinda pushing you to ask me out. What's the point when you like her better? I mean it's obvious.   But to be honest, if you actually do like me, I'd ask you out. ::laughs  hysterically:: I don't think you can imagine how many times I've actually tried to. I just can't get the words to come out right I guess. I don't know. But now that  you know how I feel about you, it's like you don't want to talk to me much anymore.  Yeah, that kind of hurts. I don't know. Maybe I'm assuming some of the things  I've said. But I'm really not being proved wrong. I've probably messed up our friendship by telling you how I feel. I mean regaurdless of whatever I still like  you. But hey man whatever.   I'm just kind of tired of dwelling on the fact that you say one thing to me and  then a bunch of other shit to Skittle. I'm tired of things being hid from me. I'd  like to know what the fuck is going on. Somebody fucking clue me in. It would  be nice to know. But its funny that if you were going to talk to anyone about  liking me you'd talk to oh gee possibly ME!!   OK. I'm not trying to sound pissed off. I'm not. I'm just like at a loss sometimes.

             OMG MY EARS!!!! MY EARS!!!     OK! I can't take it anymore. American Idol. IT HAS TURNED INTO A TERRIBLE AWFUL HORRIFIC SHOW!!!! The people on there suck. They suck so bad they make me laugh with embarassment for them! Did the judges have to just fill spots with insanly crappy people. I mean damn, I know that I'm not the best singer in the entire world but OMG I'M NOT THAT BAD!!!! That one red headed guy about made me cry he was that terrible. Those people are going all off pitch, sounding all tone deaf and everything. I mean, the try outs there were some really really good people and yet they said they weren't good enough! What the hell?? Now I bet the people who created that show are kicking their own asses for picking the worst people in the damn bunch. What were they looking for?? Another Clay Aiken?? HELLO THERE'S ONLY ONE!!! I mean did they honestly expect another geeky loser to come in and blow them away?? ::passes out:: This is so sad. I sit there watching that show hoping to God one of them does a fantastic show and I end up really really disappointed. I can't stand it. I bet that there won't be another season of that show. And if there is GOD SAVE US!!!!      Mood: Disgusted Song: THEY RUINED ALL OF THEM

             I'm ready to just curl up and die      As the end of the year comes closer and closer I find myself losing more and more of my sanity. I don't know exactly why but I just feel that way. There are just so many things going through my head. Screaming in my brain.    Worries begin to surface like the AP exam for starters. God and then the math exams have me worried off my ass because all I want to do is get the fuck out of Geometry and graduate on time. That's all I want. Plus you know I want to get those fabulous grades to make it that much easier for me to get into UNCC. My number one choice of course.  Then there are those questions that are unanswered. Most of which I really don't feel like expolting all over my blog. Because if you read all my entries you'll know what they are.  Then Kelly is worring me because she's in pain from her and Steve's break up. I sat here and tried to console her the best I can. I mean of course I know how she feels I went through all that crap with the break up with Jerry. You know you still believe you're supposed to be together yet you still can't convince the one you love to give you guys another chance. It sucks it really does. I know. But you know as they say with time pain will pass. It'll hurt for a while. I think Red from that 70s show said it best "Things started to get serious and she broke it off. Man that hurt. But as time went by I started to think less and less of her. Then one day I stopped thinking about her all together. Then that hurt. But I knew it was going to be OK."    Sometimes I feel like what sanity I have left is just slipping from my fingers. It's odd how I just bounce back and forth from being "OH WOE IS ME!" to "WOO WOO SOOOOOO HAPPY!!"  Oh well.  On a better note. Prom is in 4 days and I'm all excited. I still need to figure out if Brandon is picking me up here or I'm going to his house. Cuz fortunantly enough my dad is cool about Brandon. Plus today I got some seriously cute pictures of Joshua. OMG they're so sweet I can't wait to meet his parents.

             I hate these dwelling thougts     OK so yeah I like this guy. Supposedly he likes me too. Yet its hard for him to decide if he'd wanna date me or whatever. Why?? It's pissing me off to say the least. Its like dude if you don't wanna date me or whatever just say it damn. Or maybe it's not no your mind at all. Whatever.  Stupid me being the person that I am sits here and dwells on stupid shit like this. I feel 10 again and its really fucking sad. I should just get over it. But I don't know I really really like him. I don't know what it is but I do. I mean he's nice and funny and all that stuff.   God this is making me sick. I hate this. I hate how somebody says they like you and then they do  nothing  about it.      Mood: Kinda pissed Song: Play me ~ KoRn

       I just love this song it really fits my mood    Dare You To Move Lyrics ~Switchfoot    Welcome to the planet Welcome to existence Everyone's here Everyone's here Everybody's watching you now Everybody waits for you now What happens next What happens next [Chorus] I dare you to move I dare you to move I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor I dare you to move I dare you to move Like today never happened Today never happened before Welcome to the fallout Welcome to resistance The tension is here Tension is here Between who you are and who you could be Between how it is and how it should be [Chorus] Maybe redemption has stories to tell Maybe forgiveness is right where you fell Where can you run to escape from yourself? Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go? Salvation is here I dare you to move I dare you to move I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor I dare you to move I dare you to move Like today never happened Today never happened Today never happened Today never happened before

             And the mood of the blog goes sad     OK LOOK HERE MAN!! I don't think you understand. I REALLY LIKE YOU!! I mean that honestly. I think that  you're sweet and funny and you're nice.  I mean its really really fun to be around you. You constantly have me laughing to the point I can't eat! I don't know really what it is about you but I'm just attracted to you.  But this shit with the "I gotta think about it" that you keep telling Hayley is getting on my nerves. You say you like me to several other people but then you tell Hayley you're not sure. But then you say you do. DUDE YOU'RE GETTING ME SO LOST I NEED A FUCKING MAP!!! Is it really hard to decide if you want to ask me out or what? Or is it just that you don't like me that way and you just said that to make me feel better.   I wish you'd let me in on what's going inside your head. I mean dude, if you don't like me like that tell me so I don't have to dwell on what's going to happen next. Ya know? I wouldn't put you through something like this. It's sweet sick torture for me.  I mean damn Hayley's sitting there telling me to ask you out. NO! I can't! I can't risk asking you out and then you saying no. ME AND REJECTION DO NOT PLAY WELL TOGETHER!!! I can't stand the thought of it. It scares me. That is why I never tell any guy I like them unless I am absolutly positive that I know he likes me for like seriously for real!!  Just let me in on what's going on!!!!!!! Quit making me suffer lol!! Damn boy COME ON!!!!!!    Mood: Utterly lost Song: Dare you to Move~ Switchfoot

             OK so the happy blog goes first      TONIGHT WAS SO MUCH FUCKING FUN!!! Me and Skittle and Stewie went to Tremont again for the second night of the punk show. AND IT SOOOOOOO KICKED ASS!!!! All night Skittle was like "You have to mosh or dance with me or something." I was like FINNNNNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! I couldn't get my self hyped up enough to but I was working on it.   Met some new people. Like Ross. He kinda cute in a goofy way. But he was drunk but hey he was talking to me so I was "Okie Dokie this is fun." He only liked me because my nick name reminded him of a porno (i.e. Pretty Peaches)   Did a B- DOUBLE- E- DOUBLE- R- U- N BEER RUN!!!! For a couple of friends (JaR and Taco). We left them at the gas station though cuz piggy's rolled up. LOL.   The music was absoulty fabulous. I honestly like all this punk stuff. I used to listen to it and thought it was shitty. Straight shitty. But now I'm getting into and its really cool. It gets you all hyped up and its so fun to just sit there and scream and dance and all that stuff while listening. I mean its not like I'm going to run around screaming that I'm a punk because I'm not. But I really like the music. Are you happy Skittle you little punk you. I swear you are Heroin Bob and I'm Steve-o and Chris is Mike LMFAO SLC PUNKS!!!!!!!  So it was almost time to go and I still hadn't moshed or danced or anything so when Minority Party (i think thats the name) came on I was like "Okie Dokie Emily here we go." Thankfully Chris jumped in so he and I moshed by ourselves and then alllllllllllllllllllllll these people started getting. It was funny. It was even funnier when I fell on my ass. That hurt but I was laughing. Skittle put her arm around me and we flew in to people just spinning and shit. WE MADE THE BIGGEST MOSH PIT OF THE ENTIRE NIGHT!!!!!! OH OH GO US!!!! But we like got seperated because some asshole yanked my shoulder almost out of place. I kept going around and around and then I fell on my ass again and got stepped on and shit. I yelled out "Fuck somebody help me!!" And like 5 guys from the other side came rushing up and blocked moshers from me and got me up. I was like thank god man lol. My knee was like getting crushed. Man, omg, moshing give you like a total adrenaline rush. I AM NO LONG A MOSH PIT VIRGIN!!!!!! LMFAO!! It is so much fun. I don't know why I didn't start doing it sooner. It really hurts though when the drunk fuckers get in on it though. Because they like punch you and shit. One fucker while he was moshing and i was just standing there waiting for the right time to get back in came and like punched me in the chest. I was like bitch ass!!!!  Wow I just looked at that paragraph. That's sad that I can write that much on some moshing.     Mood: JUST SO HYPER AND HAPPY AND WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

             Fridays are fun!!      Yesterday was so much fucking fun. After a long ass day at school that wasn't all that great the events afterward made me happy.  First off me and Skittle and Stewie (lol funny), went to the skate park to go and see a friend. When we got there Price wasn't there after beggin us to come. Gayeness. Me and Skittle swore to kick his ass if he didn't show up. But after a few minutes of fucking around on the play ground he showed up. Amazing! And stupid me told them the story of Price "making love to my peaches" that i had given him for lunch and then stupidly I told them some girl was calling me peaches in my Sports med class and so now I have recieved the nickname Peaches! How gay. A nickname is one you can never give yourself but one you hate the most. But I can live. I got over it after Price sat there and taunted me with it for like 2 minutes. But we've nicknamed him Bobby Hill cuz he looks just like him. LMFAO  After the skate park we went and got my money from my mom and headed off to Tremont Music Hall. I really felt out of place at first because it was a Punk show. I really don't listen to punk music unless I'm with Skittle. But the people there were cool. I don't think I've ever seen that many mohawks and leather vests or jackets in my life. Well I've see plenty of leather vests and jackets minus the mohawks. Bikers ya know lol.  But damn, Skittle kept wanting me to get in the pit and I was like NO! These pits looked rough as hell! Plus I got a $5000 mouth maybe more now. I dont' need to get that fucked up moms would have an absolute heart attack. I walk in the door with a busted mouth "HI MOM!" ::mother passes out on the floor:: "What?" Oh I can see it now lol.  The concert was hella fun and we're going back for the second one tonight. I'm moshing tonight though. PEEZ DON"T HURT ME LOL!!!    Mood: FAN-FUCKING-TABULOUS Song: Tilt-a-Whirl

             OK NO NO NO YOU DON'T LICK THE HEEL OF HER BOOT!      OK Jerry you and I have got an issue. I am sick and tired of being ditched by you. I am sick and tired of it. Thursdays is our day to hang to out. And you fucking know this.  But damn it all to hell if Sarah doesn't call asking you and Elf to go to Morey's with her. WHAT THE FUCK?? And you say "Of course we'll come!" Knowing full well that I can't go!! You know that I have school and I'm the "baby" of the circle. Why in the fuck must you ditch me for her??  Are you trying to get some from her? Hun, I can tell you now it ain't gonna happen. She more than likely thinks she's too good for you. Everytime she comes around you and Elf are at her beck and call. I'm sick of you acting like I don't exist.  What do you lick the heel of her boot now?? Are you her bitch?? No? Well fuck man. Stop being a dick and act like we're best friends.   Mood: Pissed Song: Fuck you!

             OK. So you're over "Us" but you still love me. THAT MAKES NO SENSE FUCK BAG!!!!!      OK Jerry! You told me tonight after I so stupidly asked you that you're over us. As in the relationship. I knew it was coming sooner or later but damn it still hurts. When you told me that you were it was like 500 BILLION arrows flew straight into my heart laughing as they pierced it.  I mean its liike "Well, damn!" I understand we're both eventually gonna move on but it still hurts. I mean its gonna kill me to see you with another female. But sooner or later (more than likely later) I'll find somebody.   Don't get me wrong babe, I'll always love you. You'll forever have a place in my heart. And until we die you'll always be my best friend. I mean you and I are forever connected whether we like it or not because of our son. But you do need to understand shit like that still hurts. I don't know how else to feel.  Yet, it doesn't make sense that you sit there and tell me that you're over "us" but you'll forever love me. HOW DO YOU LOVE SOME ONE AND  NOT  WANT TO BE WITH THEM????  I'm slowly accepting the fact that we're apparently not supposed to be together. As much as I want to fight for "us" I'm gonna have to let it allllllll die. And that hurts too. I'm a fucking fighter. I want something and I'll run myself into the ground trying to get it. But now I think for once, I'm letting go and giving up on this certain fight. I'm pretty sure you'll be happy about that.  At least we're best friends and the sex is still good!!! LMAO.    Mood: Sad but I know it'll be okie dokie Song: No More Love ~ Shinedown

             I've stepped outside myself and found a person I don't know     Well damn. Two of my friends who were going out broke up. Sadness. I don't know what else to say about that.  The school year is coming close to an end. I'm so happy. This year has been rough for me. With being pregnant for like most of the year and all. That turned out good though. Joshua is getting soooooo big. He's a damn whopper. I love it. He's gonna be like a line backer or something for a damn football team.   The break up with Jerry has come and gone. I've realized that I'm so much happier being his friend. I love how he introduces me to someone new as his best friend. I swear in like 10 years we're gonna be "Will and Grace" with out Jerry being gay. LMAO. OMG if he turned out that way though I'd die laughing. Just to imagine Jerry makes me laugh. Oh I love him. I always will. But that will never change. I mean yes, he and I will move. On maybe we'll get back together maybe we won't. Who know's who cares. Being best friends is all I could ever ask for. I LOVE YOU JERRY   Then Hayley (Skittle). My best homie in the entire world. She's been there for me through thick and thin. Letting me piss and moan bitch and groan. She's never told me what I  wanted  to hear but what I  needed  to hear. I love you for that homie. You and I have had our share of guy issues. ::clears throat:: Toad, Smurf, Pinz, ummmmmmmm all them lol. We have sooooo many damn memories isn't not even funny. Forever getting lost then some how making it home. Screaming Zug Island as we flew on down the road to some new county. LMAO. Playing the anarchy music in small closed areas for all to hear lol. All the damn inside jokes. So many. ROLLING PIN OF DEATH!!!! I love ya homie!!!!!  School. School has been just ugh. I mean even though I've made honor roll all this year and held a 3.40 on average I've hated Independence. It's just a fun school. It's stuck on it foot ball pride. How gay. I mean I like most of the people there but damn then you've got those who are so prided in the schools 4X state champion. Wow that's not what schools all about. Am I the only one who believes that??   (more will be added later look for it)      Mood: Thoughtful like Song: Fly with me~ Zug Island

            Remember when like 10 people in an entire school where the only ones who were depressed??   Holy shit man. I'm sitting here last night just reading random peoples blogs and you know what fucking pattern I see? Everybody is fucking depressed? I mean holy hell you guys? What the fuck? Has being depressed become the new trend or something? I mean I know we all have our hardships and things that totally get us down but damn you're not AUTOMATICALLY depressed. I mean I don't think I've actually sat here and actually written out that "I'm soooooooooo depressed." Until I'm clinically diagnosed with the shit I don't say it.  And if you all are so damn depressed maybe it's time for a damn change. OMG! I just sat here reading y'alls shit and was amazed at how sad you all were. I mean I know there are times where I get down but damn I don't say I'm depressed. Well I do but I'm only joking.   You all aren't depressed. You're just sad. SAD THAT'S ALL IT IS! Sorry to pop your bubbles. You all can't be basket cases. Unlike me! LOL only kidding. Well wait..... THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER SUBJECT! LOL.  You guys if you're so "depressed" change some shit around. Get away from the things that make you so "depressed."  "But I can't get away from my parents!" AH FUCK YOUR PARENTS! You have like what 1 to 2 years until your out of there. Fuck give them hell. It'll be fun I swear! You won't be so depressed all the time then. You could actually have fun. And instead of sittin on your asses get UP AND DO SOMETHING. God have you fuckers out there are depressed because you have WAY too much going on at your schools. Be lazy like me. Fuck the clubs, fuck the plays, fuck all that shit. You honestly don't need it. "But that's what colleges look at." If your grades aren't good enough then they aren't EVEN going to peek at your fucking extra ciricular activities. I mean damn.  You all are just stressing your selves to the point where you actually believe you're depressed. It's truely sad. Really. I mean I feel for you guys but you all just need to take time to chill out. Clear your minds. Cleans your soul and spirit.  NO WAIT WAIT PERFECT SOLUTION! Why don't you all just do drugs. Swear to God you won't be stressed or depressed any more. LOL. OMG don't even take that seriously. I'm only kidding.  Y'all just need to chill out. I say this cuz I love you guys. There's no point in thinking your depressed. Because in all honesty you're not.

            You talking scared the living shit out of me   OMG! So much was said. Most of it didn't make sense. I can't really figure out why. How come you said all that stuff to me then told me to forget it? You must have felt comfortable enough around me to tell me all that you did so how can I forget? Are you really that worried that'll I'll go back on my word and and tell the whole world what was said? Don't worry a promise is a promise and I keep those.  But damn, half the shit you said scared the shit out of me. Most of which didn't make any sense. You seemed so scatter-brained. Yet it was like you tried your damnedest to clarify it all. You sounded so hurt. There was so much pain in what you said. All I wanted to do was give you a big ass hug and hold you and tell you everything was going to be OK. But I couldn't. I couldn't even get a damn number right to call you because you wanted me to.   And another thing. Why did you want me to be there so bad? Why me of all people? I'm not that great I can promise you that. And did it slip when you said you loved me. Was it just randomness or was it the truth.  What the fuck is going on with you sweetheart? I'm really beginning to worry. I can't just forget the things you said. There's no possible way. It's kind of your fault. You burned them on to my brain. Reason being, you repeated yourself A LOT! But I'll try to forget because you asked me to.  You asked me why I was sad. Here's why. Because I care. I don't like to see the ones I care for suffer in any way. I want everybody to be happy and carefree. I mean I know that's not possible for everybody but at least I can give it a shot to help and make others happy.  You also asked me why I felt bad. For all the same reasons I was sad. I don't think you really understand how much I  do  care for you. Even if you told me not to care I couldn't help myself but to.  I'm still wondering why you said those things you did. Was it to get reactions out of me? Were you trying to see what I'd say? Were you trying to see how much I really do care? Because I can tell you all those things. I can tell you how I'd react or what I'd say or how much I do care.   You really worried me last night. I could have sworn you were going insane. But it felt like you were using me to keep you grounded in some sense of reality. Was that what it was? Are you that comfortable with me that in times of need I can some how keep you grounded?  What is going on with you? I'm racking my brain and trying to figure out the answers but they're not there.    Mood: Lost! Really really lost! I NEED A DAMN MAP! HOLY HELL!

Smile and smirk. Thinking the next guys gonna be just some asshole jerk. Wanting so bad to have another hold her. Keep her warm. She's sold. She's cold. Kiss her lip. See her smile. Never could you imagine her pain. Never could you know the scars that tear along her soul. Her heart. She's sold. She's cold. Many have tried to renew her blackened heart. Most have failed. She's cried a thousand times. She's lost too many things. She's starting just not to care. She's sold. She's so damn cold.

            You will not understand it in its entirity unless you are the person I'm writing about    (Actually written 4/14)   OMG! Boiling! Insanly pissed! God, does he think I am  that  stupid?? Does he seriously believe I am some   TOY   he can fuck around with?   The fires of hell will consume this Earth before that happens!   "Oh, oh! But I don't want to hurt her! But I want to do thinkgs with you!" Well damn, Monday, in the backseat you sure as hell acted like it!      You kissed me! You pulled me close! You laced your fingers with mine! IT WASN'T ALL ME!!!     I don't want to hurt her either. But damn it all to hell if that doesn't make me want you more!   Yet you can't even  IMAGINE  how much it hurts to have you tell me what you did then throw your relationship with her  ALL UP IN MY FACE!!  Do you find that funny? Does it please you to see me suffer??   You of all people know my story with guys! You know the pain that silently rips me apart.  Fucker! I am  NOT  some one for you to toy with! My mind, my emotions! Those are not things to fuck with.  HA! You don't try to mess with an emotionally unstable bitch!    I WILL FUCK YOUR ENTIRE LIFE UP!    You don't even understand how  easily  I could! I could call her right now and tell her   EVERYTHING  that's happened between us!  But no, no! I just want you to be happy.  THAT'S BULLSHIT!  I want you to step inside my head, my heart. Feel what I feel. Think what I think. Live my damn turmoil I silently suffer with every damn day.  You think you know? You honestly do? I mean, I know you have pain of your own. But shit, you don't know the half of mine. You try and deal with losing your first love over some   bullshit  You try and deal with having your first born child and have to give him up! Can you do that? Can you even fathom taht heart break?? No I don't think so! So how the    FUCK   do you think you have any right to fuck with my head??  Now, maybe I'm accusing you of too much. Maybe I'm completely and utterly wrong. You could actually care. You just might possibly have feelings for me. But    YOU    make it so damn unclear.  Get your shit straight. Please. You're putting me through hell. It's not right. It's unlawful.   You know I'd love to be with you. Yet, you are the one holding "us" back. But I'm not pushing. I'll let what could be come as it may. I fucking refuse to chase you.

             I always believed the number 13 was unlucky. It's proved itself true    (actually written 4/13)   Damn, these past two days have been just ugh! Last night Skittle and I kidnapped Pinz, just to get him out of the house. And I knew 'something' was going to happen. It always does. So we go and surprise Alex. Well we spent some time up there. That was all fun. Well Skittle and Alex were saying or doing their goodbyes ( =D ) me and Pinz walked outside. I asked him what was on his mind because, well, the entire car ride up to Alex's he just looked like he was thinking about something. You know he kept putting his head in his hands and sighing. He tells me then, he's got feelings for me. I was like  hold up, pause, rewind, play again   WHAT???  That took me totally by surprise. I mean twice now, I've told him I have feelings for him and I've gotten no response. Nothing. And now he tells me this? Damn. So the entire time on the ride home we sat there in the back talking. I mean I'm sitting there thinking "Wow, he might actually have  real  feelings for me. All the while we're holding hands and each other. When me and Hayley got back to my house I was like in the best damn mood. In awe and everything.  HA! That mood got killed tonight. We went and got Kelly. Don't get me wrong I love the girl to death. She's one cool ass mother fucker. She's also Pinz's girl.   There's your fucking twist  We took Kelly with us to go and get Pinz because he was going to go and stay at Alex's. Once Kelly and him got together it was like  ::SMACK::  ALL UP IN MY FACE all up on her. Throwing his relationship with her in my face. I'm sitting there thinking to myself "Damn guess what you said was BULLSHIT! Or was it? God, I feel like such a damn fool. I mean what the fuck??" He goes and tells me one thing and then acts another?? Am I just something for him to play with? I refuse to be a toy. My emotions and my heart are NOT things to play with!  I'm a damned human. I swear. It hurt so fucking much to see him and Kelly hands locked, kisses exchanged. And me sitting there trying not to cry. The entire night I held back my tears and anger. Not now. Not now since I'm alone. Forever alone.  I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE'S TOY!!     Somebody  please  PROVE ME WRONG!!  Mood:Kill me please Song: Fuck the World~ ICP

Well Saturday I get online to check my mail and Skittle pops up asking me to join her and 4 others on a Scavenger Hunt. I was like hell yeah that sounds like fun. So we have certain things we have to find. I got arrested and hugged by this hottie of a cop. YESH!  Highlight!   Nikki sat on the Easter Bunny at Carolina Place Mall. That bunny did naughty things to her back! ::shocked:: I thought they were good natured non-dirty things lol. But by then end of the hunt we won by like twenty points and it was all good.

              These three days have been a blissful blur and I LOVE IT part 2!!   (there is one more part)   Well gee friday. I love Friday! Friday was so much fun! I decided to skip school. What was the real point of going. No one was going to be there. I had no reason to be there so my mom actually was all cool and said I could. Sleep is nice. Sleep is my friend. Except when your homie calls you at 9:45 actually expecting you to be up (I love you Skittle but daaaaaaaaaamn come on now lol). Then sleep left me when Skittle called me again at 10:30 telling me to get up and that I was going to go somewhere with her. I was like "Uggggggggggghhhhhhh I hate you but OK!" LOL. So at about 10:30 she came and got me with Chipley. I can't stand that boy sometimes but stealing his weed is just too damn easy. LOL. Even though I can get that from like anybody for free. (I don't do it allllllllllllllllllll the time so its all good I could stop whenever I wanted swear to God try me lol). So we had to take him back to his house for a minute but he ended up having to stay. So Skittle asked me where I wanted to go. I said lets go to Weddington. I think Chris is skating down there today. So we went down there couldn't find the place and ended up in S.C. LOL. Lancaster is fun!!!! Well Smurf (    Part three coming soon.

            These three days have been a blissful blur and I LOVE IT!!  (there is three parts to this so yeah)  OK so this entry is gonna be kind of long. So if you're like the one person that reads these things I hope you have time lol.  So we shall start with Thursday. After school my homie Skittle came and got me. We decided to go and find the "campsite" that's behind our houses where Blade, Pinz, and Tacks have been going. So we parked her car up at Turtle Rock at the pool and began on the trail.  So we have absolutly no idea where the place is except for the fact that it's really close to 485 and all that mess. So Skittle and I are walking around and we see this little circle of, well not necessarily litte, but circle of big stones with a fire pit and a cross in the front of it. Weird thing was the cross had the scriptures Genisus 17:7 and Matthews 6:24 on it. Looked them up. But anyways I told her I thought this was it and she said she didn't think it was. Then I remembered Mary (chick whos gone up there) telling me they slept in a huge 10 person tent and you could see 485 almost clearly from where the site was. So we kept going. We ended up way off the trail which was ok because ended up from the back of Turtle Rock to the back of our own neighborhood lol. Well we finally got back on the path and decided to turn around. WE GOT TURNED AROUND ALRIGHT LOL! We were going up the path when I thought I saw something from the corner of my eye and screamed "HOLY SHIT! THERE IT IS! WE FOUND IT!!" lol. Kinda bad I was that damn excited lol. So we snooped around there for a bit then decided we really needed to get back. Well we couldn't figure out how to get back. We ended up sliding down a hill that was right beside 485 and walking along it. We got honked at by like 30 cars.  Highlight!!  Well we ended up walking through briars. GOT ONE STUCK ALL UP IN MY ARM!! ouchies! We jumped a barbed wire fence. OMG THAT SUCKED LOL! Then we ran down an overpass on 485 with on coming traffic. That scared the living shit out of me! OMG I was about to cry lol. We got to a chain link fence and Skittle was like we have to jump it and then we'll be almost home. I was like I can't do it. There's something about chain link fences that scares me lol. I really don't know what it is. So I found a hole and crawled through it with Skittle flipping me off the entire time lol. We ended up on a road like 3 miles from Turtle Rock. So she  called a friend and had him pick us up and take us back. She then took me to Smurfs where I fell asleep. THAT WAS AN ADVENTURE!!!    look for part two!  Mood: Elated Song: Burning Bright ~Shine down

            The scar along my heart is the silent turmoil I've recieved from love    Oh, gentle feelings, soft sounds, the goodness and the gradual stilling of a soul that has been moved; the melting happiness of the first tender touching joys of love-- where are you? Where are you? ~ Ivan Turgeney, First Love   In recent situations, I have discovered, that I, myself, no longer wants to find love. I really don't feel like finding it anymore. There is this gigantic scar along my heart from love. There's too much drama involved in it. There's too many tears to be cried. Love isn't supposed to be like that. Love is supposed to be happy, make you smile, make you laugh. But when the love you want is so close your finger tips can almost brush it, it's so damn far away. That's silent turmoil that I have to deal with every day. It's the turmoil that has been haunting me for four months now. Love is what's killing me. Wanting it. Needing it. To be loved by someone, to be truely loved, can make one feel complete. I once had that type of love. But twice now love ran away from me and reared its ugly head. I can't stand it. I keep wondering why this keeps happening to me! Is this a test of some sort? Is God punishing me for some wrong I've commited? Every guy that I believe there could be something with either ends up not having the same feelings, ignores what I tell them, or leaves me. I'm tired of it. There's no use in finding it. If love finds me then great, fabulous. I'm done looking. Yes, I have given up.  It pains me to give up. I'm really not one to give up. I never have been. I've always fought for what I thought was right, what was supposed to be. But I can't anymore. I can't fight a battle that I'm not going to win. I can't battle with love. I can't force it to be mine. As much as I want to. Things just can't happen. Maybe I'm not one to have love in my life. I mean I love my friends. I love my family. I love my son. But it's like I have all this love to give and no one to give it to. Or to anyone who wants it.  I fought for a 2 1/2 year relationship. I tried my damn best to bring it back. But I couldn't. I've expressed to one person, I believe twice now, how I feel about them, and was rejected. Fine, whatever, I'm done. I can't do it anymore. It's killing me inside. It's tearing my soul to pieces. My heart is brusied, cut, scard. I'm done. There's no fight left for love in me.  What's the point? If there is a point in fighting for love can somebody give me the reason. Because I can't seem to find one.   Mood: Hurt Song: Love song ~ ICP

       Whenever I bang my head on the wall the screaming seems to stop   I'm tired. I'm sick and tired of it all. I give up. I'm done. There's no use in trying anymore. I'm sick of the blank stares. I'm sick of the no responses. I'm tired of pouring my heart out and no one really understands or listens. I would just like to be "normal." I would like to be an emotionally balanced person. But no everything has to be so damn difficult. Things need to change. But they won't. No matter how hard I try. You called me the strongest person you ever knew tonight. If I was so strong I wouldn't be giving up like I am. YOu don't understand. You never will. YOu don't listen. You don't hear me. I could scream until I'm blue in the face and I assume you still wouldn't care. So I'm done. I give. I'm never gonna be able to let you go. But I guess I'll try.

       If I had enough courage I'd give this letter to you....    To my everything,       I need to be honest with you and confess everything. I'm ready to lay it all out on the table. I have  never  loved anyone. Until I met you. Never. That night I met you, I instantly fell in love with you. I acted like a little school girl, giggling and such, and yet you still asked to call me.        That summer morning you showed up at my house knocking on my door. I couldn't believe it but I was so damn happy. I couldn't believe the joy I felt. When we kissed for the first time, I thought my heart was going to run screaming out of my chest I was so damn happy. I wanted to cry tears of joy and excitment of finding a person like you.      When we began our relationship I felt like nothing could go wrong. And for a while it didn't. After a little over a year and half had past we began to argue more and more. I could never figure out why. Maybe it was because we were always with each other.      Then that ever fateful day. You left me. My heart was ripped in two. I swore to myself I would hate you for the rest of my life and never be with you again for how you ended it. You always said that if you were to leave me you'd do it in person. But you were to stoned to deal with it personally so instead you called. That hurt. To this day it still does. I was a mess for those two months. Crying, sick, depressed. I loved you so much it hurt.      That one night in May when we began to talk again. When you started to act like I existed once again. My promise to my self waved itself good bye. That night we decided to get back together I cried. And you sounded so damn happy as well.      We made the mistake of starting our physical relationship again with out the protection needed. Two months later we found out I was pregnant. I wondered what we should do. You told me whatever would make me happy. I couldn't tell my parents. I didn't want to disappoint them. I was always labled the "good child". The one that never did anything dramatically wrong accept miss curfew once in a while. I wanted to get an abortion and pretend it never happened. But that didn't happen.       I went to the doctors the day you decided to go out of town. That's when hell broke loose and my parents found out. During the pregnancy we argued so much. Whether it was my hormons going nuts or it was the stress from my parents not knowing to the problems you had at home and needing a job. I don't know. Two weeks later you broke it off again. But you stayed around. Being the best damn friend you could have ever been.       You always called to check on me when you couldn't see me just to make sure I was feeling OK. You stopped by to see me. Just because.        That day I went to the hospital and called you because they had to enduce me, you came at a record pace. Staying with me the entire time. Holding my hand through out the night of waiting to deliever our son. Then when the time came to push you stayed right there telling me it was going to alright. That love you have for me shone brighter than it ever had before.         When I saw you hold our son for the first time I wanted to burst out in tears because I knew we would never be a "real" family so to speak. If only we had been a little older. Those four days I had to stay in the hospital you stayed with me. Never leaving my side except to get food or smoke a cigarrett. It means so much to me that you did all that.        The day I was released you came back with me to my house and just stayed there to make sure I would adjust. You  held me while I cried because I wanted our son back so much. I still do. But I'm OK with it.     Lately you and I have talked about "us" a lot. Tonight I asked you "Would you ever consider getting back with me?" You told me yes. So what are you waiting for? For us to be older so we can be married? Are you scared things will turn our like they did before? Have you honestly not noticed that you and I have changed? Me, becoming more laid back, funny, relaxed person. You all the sudden have become a whole lot more sweet and sensitive. Making me laugh. Always willing to hang out. You make time for me when you know you shouldn't. When you have more important things to do.     So why is it so hard for you to accept that we should just be together. Everyone believes that we should. My parents even though they don't like it have told me that we'd end up being together for the rest of our lives. So why can't you just put your hand back in my and live the rest of your days with me? That's all I want. All I need. I'm ready but I have to wait on you.      Granted that may not happen for a while. I may be with someone else. But the day you want to talk about getting back together. As horrible as it may sound I'd drop the other person in a damn heart beat. Because damn it that's how much I love you.       I just want to be with you and only you. You're the one for me. My soul mate. My love, my life. My everything.  I love you always and forever, ~Me    Song: Love song by 311

       I'M NOT EVIL I SWEAR!!     You have a malicious soul! Malice, when defined means, The urge to see the sufferings of others But you dont really mean any harm to anyone, you just like to watch it. Mischievous, cruel, and seducing, you can hurt others with cruel words or just be plain mean. Prank calls, tripping people, and breaking the laws are your favorite past times. You can lie just as easily as laugh, even to a close one. People are intimidated by you because you never let people get close to you. Youre cold, ruthless, and pessimistic behavior drives people away, which show the pain you feel inside.    urlLink   What Kind of SOUL do you posses?

          This is the one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.      Finger 11 - One Thing   Verse 1: Restless tonight,  'Cause I wasted the light. Between both these times, I drew a really thin line. It's nothing I planned, And nothing I can. But you should be in line, Across that line.  Chorus: If I traded it all, If I gave it all away for one thing. Just for one thing. If I sorted it out, If I knew all about this one thing, Wouldn't that be something?  Verse 2: I promise I might, Not walk on by. Maybe next time, But not this time. Even though I know, I don't wanna know. Yeah I guess I know, I just hate how it sounds.  Chorus: If I traded it all, If I gave it all away for one thing. Just for one thing. If I sorted it out, If I knew all about this one thing, Wouldn't that be something? (2x)  Even though I know, I don't wanna know. Yeah I guess I know, I just hate how it sounds. (2x)  Chorus: If I traded it all, If I gave it all away for one thing. Just for one thing. If I sorted it out, If I knew all about this one thing, Wouldn't that be something? (3x)

           OMG! You just don't get it do you!?   I've become so frustrated with you now. It's making my eye twitch. All I want more than anything in this world right now, is you! Can you not see that? How can you not? I know it's obvious! I mean come on!  You act like you want the same! I'm putting my self through hell. The reason being is my stupidity of being a damn fighter. When I want something that means the absolute world to me, I go after it. I go after it until I can't anymore. And damn it all to hell that's what I'm doing with you. I love you too damn much. I love you too damn much to ever,  ever  let you go. I just couldn't. That would kill me on the inside. It would break my heart completely. Not that it already isn't.   You just don't understand. The times that we spend together. I feel complete. That hole inside of me is filled. But no! No you just reject me and sometimes it's like I'm just your damn toy. Even though that's not true.   You sat there and told me to my face and I quote "I love you. I always have. I always will. That will never change." THEN WHY IN THE FUCK CAN'T WE BE TOGETHER!!! HOW IN THE HELL DO YOU LOVE SOMEBODY AND  NOT WANT  TO BE WITH THEM?? That makes NO sense to me whatsoever! I could never put anyone through what you're doing to me! I mean I know you don't realize what you're doing and maybe someday you'll understand.  But damn it. There is so much we've gone through together. Too much for people our age. I know all that you have to deal with is hard. I know that our relationship took a bad turn. We hit a really bad slump. It all happened out of stupidity.   But damn it, every damn time it begins to get to the point where our relationship begins to be tested YOU RUN AWAY AND GIVE UP! I can't. I can't run. I can't give up. That's not me! It never will be. When things get tough I fight to make them right. It's too bad that you don't.   So answer this for me if you only want to be friends then why do you: 1.) Kiss me like you fucking mean it? 2.) Hold me for no reason at all? 3.) Tell me you love me? 4.) Forever and a day want to hang out? 5.) Put your arm around me or hold my hand when we're out in public!? 6.) Make the first moves that lead in to something? and all the other things. That would be a long ass list if I wrote it all.   You are my heart. I love you and you know that. I always will. But this is becoming to painful to stand. I try to sit there and act like friends but you put out the energy and the vibes that you want  so much more.    What in the flying hell am I supposed to do? How in the fuck am I supposed to feel??  I just don't understand you anymore and your actions. And I believe you just don't get it either. I think you honestly don't know what you want anymore. Whether its being with me or not. Whether you want to stay in this town or not. Whether its being happy or not. I don't think you know what to do with yourself anymore.   I'm tired of you running away. Stand up and fucking speak boy. Answer the questions I've asked you so many times before. Stop confusing me. Show me what the fuck you want to be. Whether it be a relationship or friendship. I need to know. I need to know soon because it is DRIVING ME INSANE!!!   Mood: Just lost, hurt, pissed Song: .45 by Shinedown

             I had a dream last nigh     I had the utmost disturbing dream last night. There are 4 rooms. One of them is in the middle of 3 of them. One room sits Jerry playing his music, another is Skittle talking on the computer, and the other room is my dad. I'm stuck in the middle room with a guy who is just beating the shit out of me. Like smashing my head into the wall, pounding me with his fists, kicking me, all that shit. As he's doing this I keep calling out everybody's names but no one can hear me. I guess then the guy gets his fill of beating on me and walks out of the room. Some how (b/c I look absolutly fucked up blood and everything everywhere) I get up and drag my self to the first room. The one where Skittle is. I ask her "Why didn't you help me?" and she sits there and just stares in horror. I drag myself to the next room where Jerry is and ask him the same question and he just sits there and laughs at me saying "I told you so you stupid bitch." Finally I drag myself to the room where my dad is. I once again ask the question and just shakes his head and turns his back on me. I drag myself back into the room where I first started off and collapsed on the floor.   Damn, when I woke up from this dream I just cried. I couldn't help but to feel totally abandoned. But there's no point. Those are 3 people in my life who I'm pretty fucking sure would never just up and leave me like they did in the dream. Right?      Mood: Scared Song: nothing

             SWING BATTA BATTA SWWWWWWWWWIIIIIINNNNNNGGGGAAAAAAAA!!!!      Yeah so my day. Hmmmm where to begin? Well, I wasn't feeling well this morning as I wasn't yesterday. OOOOO CORRECT GRAMMER!!!!!!! LMAO!!!! So I suffered through E-Commerce this morning and got my work done. Thankfully we're doing partner work so I she told me to just make suggestions whenever the teacher walked by but I didn't have to do anything. I love starved-for-attention girls! They're great.  So, I got to Geometry this morning and I was just feeling completely ill. I really wanted to go home. But this chick can't miss anymore days. I got into class and immediatly put my head down. My teacher told me to sit up. I told her "No I'm not feeling good at all." So then she started yelling at me saying "I don't care how you feel you need to put your head up and pay attention." So then I yelled back "I already know this! Second year here! Unless you've forgotten!" So I put my head back. She then yelled "I'm calling security to remove you!" I told her "Go ahead. But I know as well as you do that they are going to come to the room, ask who needs to be removed, look at you and laugh, then leave! It happens every time you try to get me remove. So sure go ahead and make a fool of yourself!"  It's insanly stupid as she hasn't caught on that the security aren't going to remove me! They never do! Awww the advantages of knowing the principal personally! LOL! And ya know what?? She never called security.  Then I went to science and that was funny. My science teacher Mr. Hess (the absolute most slammin teacher ever, I mean he sits there and lets me bitch and we talk about drugs and drinking and we bash on the kids in the class together LMFAO)he put me and two other girls in a seperate class (Oceanography) while the other kids are in the Active Physics part. We had a sub and he didn't leave any work for me or the other two girls so we basically didn't have to do anything. The sub really didn't understand that so she kept yelling at me and Mya and we just sat there looking at her and smiling.  Got to lunch and got molested! LOL! Awwww if you're names not Skittle you don't know and don't need to lmao.  Then went and was a hard core swinger and yeah my day progressivly got better.   ::Peachez steps up to the plate.....she looks hesitant....she swings a couple of times....the pitcher throws a curve (SWING BATTA BATTA SWIIIIIIIINNNNNNNGGGGGAAAAAAAA the crowd screams)......she connects.......going....going....GOING....GOOOOONNNNNNNEEEEE!!...take that victory lap Peachez::      Mood: Nice but it could  be better if someone could take a hint of the title (meaning STEP UP TO THE PLATE!!!)

             My throat is raw from screaming and never being heard     Last night was just hmmmm. Jerry called me and apoligized for not showing up. Even though he said he was sorry I still gave him a piece of my mind and told him that he could have called a helluva lot sooner and I could have gone and chilled with Skittle. But I swear we talked until like 10:30 last night about everything. Everything was just put out in the open. All the secrets and lies. It was refreshing even though there were still some things I didn't want to know. He asked me when I was going to start dating again. I was like "Ugh what a question to ask." I told him there is someone I'm interested in and trying to get things to move but eh I dunno. I asked him why he hadn't begun dating again and he wouldn't answer me. What am I supposed interpret from that?? Hell, I dunno.  OK so on to other things. Price, dude, c'mooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!  I've asked you to hang out sometime and you're all like yeah sure. Then nothing happens because you know you and Skittle went out for like two days. Then you know you popped up one day online and asked if I still wanted to hang out sometime. I was like most def. Hmmmmmm still NOTHINGS HAPPENED!!!!! Is it that hard to just up and go "Hey lets go this place or lets do this..." Ha! Maybe I should just do that.     Mood:Eh sick Song:iono

             From sad and depressed to happy and hyper!     OK...so today was semi-depressing. I mean you know it's mother's day and I can't really celebrate it like most mother's out there but I still can in a sense right? I can be happy that my son has a wonderful home, loving parents, and everything and anything that he needs. So that's how I'll celebrate Mother's Day. I'll be thankful for everything good my son has.   It's kind of amazing to me how my friends influence my emotions. I mean all day I wanted some one to just talk to besides my parents and my brother. I NEEDED MY HOMIEZ!! I was just so ugh and blah starting off today. It wasn't cool because you know "I woke up on the wrong side of the bed."   And of course I cried a little bit because of the thoughts in my head and how I was feeling. Talked to my mom about and that made me feel better to just get it out.  I was wanting to talk to Jerry because you know he's a really good person to talk to. Really because he knows how I feel about the situation with Joshua better than anyone. I'm so happy he's still here for me. And claims me as his best friend. I think I'm really close to being settled with it all. I honestly do. But you know by this time in like two days I'll be saying "But I still love him and want to be with him." How silly. Don't you agree?   Now I'm online talking to all my friends. Me and Skittle drooling together over the R.M. band leader together. LMAO Getting "raped" by Chris =D I don't mind that though. LOL Just laughing and I absolutly love it.

             Sign me, Kiss me, I can now die!     Oh tonight! Tonight was just....fabulous. Absolutly fabulous. Hott guyz every which way you turn. Stupid little bitches you wish you could just punch. Fucking great music on stage. Thankfully nobody got fucked up tonight except one stupid bitch who apparently got assaulted by a guy and they had to call the cops. GAYNESS!!  If you can't guess, I went with Skittle and Alya (sp?) to Tremont to see another kick ass Punk show. Forgotten Youth, Minority Party, The Breifs, and The Real McKinzies (sp)!!   Man I was hopin to get myself up to it and mosh tonight but that didn't happen. Reason being, the guys in the pit were fuckin punchin and kicking. I'm sorry I'm not getting hit in the face for nobody. I would have jumped but another reason there were too many damn drunks. This one guy was so bombed he could stand straight without another persons help. Even then he couldn't stand straight. I was kind of sad.  OMG THE R.M KICKED SO MUCH ASS. The were the absolute best band of the entire night. I screamed my self horse through their show. They have the scottish accents, the KILTS MAN THE FUCKING KILTS!!, and bagpipes. THEY SO ROCKED!! I mean, people were clapping, jumping, singing along. That is a band that makes you wanna clap, move, jump, head bang, pump your fist in the air. After the show Alya bought one of their CD's and she wanted to get it signed so I went up to the band leader and asked him to. He started off with "XOX" and asked me if I knew what it meant and I said "Hugs and kisses?" so then he hugged me and kissed me I was like "YESH!!" Then I asked him to sign my pants and he did. He said to me "It's cryptic." But I think I figured out what it says. He wrote "XOX P X Mc X" So maybe it says something along the lines of "Kiss Hug Kiss Punk Kiss McKinzes Kiss?" Maybe? I dunno and I don't care HE SIGNED MY PANTS AND THAT ROCKS SO MUCH ASS!!! Then he signed Skittles patch on her boob  and he said "You like that don'tcha??" IT WAS GREAT.  Then on the ride home we listened to the CD. Fabulousness!!      Mood: Elated Song: Anything my the R.M.

             Oh the 9th!      I'm gonna be kind of upset on the 9th. It's going to suck. Try and figure out why! I'm just gonna stay in bed alllllllllllll day unless somebody comes and kidnapps me.  Me and my brother:::::::  Brandon: ROCK!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAHHHHHHHHHHH (singing) Me: OK go eat your fried poor ham now! (he goes and plays pointless notes on the piano) Brandon: NO I'M GOING TO STAND HERE AND PLAY POINTLESS NOTES AND ROCK OUT!!!!! Me: Are you sure you're turning 21 this year? Brandon: NO! ROCK! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAHHHHHH! Me: OMG! Go away you tard bucket. (Brandon skips from the room)  Sorry just had to put that in cuz it was funny.  Yesterday was nice. To put it simply. I had absolutly nothing to do yesterday cuz Skittle went to City Fest (I hope you had bunches of fun homie!!). I started to clean and usually through my neighborhood people have loud bass systems and you can here them. So as I was about to start vaccumming I heard this loud ::booooooom booooooooom:: I was like "Nu-uh" cuz I thought that Jerry was going to be busy alllllll week. And then a blue neon speeds down my driveway and lo and behold who walks through the door??? JERRY-KINS!! I asked him what he was doing here and he told me he came to kidnapp me. I told him he had to wait until I cleaned up first and the he was sweet enough to help me. Well he takes me to his house where me him and another kid named Brandon (GOOMBA MAN I SWEAR TO GOD!! SKITTLE YOU KNOW!! LMFAO) played Mario Party 3. Those two kept laughing at me because the other princess (I was Peach) Daisy stole my star and my money. Then Jerry's mom comes in and tossed two packs of cigarretts in my lap and said "You're mom came by!" I was like WOO HOOO maybe these will last through Tremont man!! I gotta find out if Skittle and I are going.  I hope I hope! But last night was just nice. Just to chill with Jerry and have nothing happen was just....nice. And for once I didn't cry because we weren't together. And for once I didn't cry because he said he loved me and had it only mean "as friends." I think I'm doing well. Don't you??

             You're making me miss you too damn much and I hate you for it!     Why? Why did you have to say that? Why did you tell me you love me? Don't you know it hurts to hear you say that? It pains me because we can't be together. I mean I know you're over "us" and I'm getting to the place where I'm over "us" as well. But I still can't help but to think there still might be something there! And that sucks. I miss you sweetheart. I just want to hang out and chill with you. But all the sudden you're so busy. I mean I can understand that you need to make money so you don't have to move in with your grandparents. I wouldn't want to either. Especially when mine are crazy. But God, it sucks that you can't even call me back when you say you will. I mean I know you have a life but I thought I was apart of it as well. Aren't I? I mean you and I are best of friends. So you say...... It's ugh! You're confusing me because you start to act all sweet again. You started doing that the last time you wanted to get back togehter. And NO NO you cannot do that to me. Not when I'm really starting to accept the fact that I know you and I will never be together again. You are placing false hope with in me. Why why must this happen??  YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!!! I WON'T LET YOU!!!! I deserve so much better. I know I do! I can't keep wanting to run back to you! I can't allow myself to have that pain of me chasing you and you rejecting me. I can't have that. I am sick to death of crying over what can't be!!! I'm done wanting you! Haven't you realized that? We're not meant to be right now. Things are too damn tough for us to have a relationship?? So stop! Take a step back. Be my friend....be my fuck buddy......BUT DO NOT TRY AND PLAY YOUR MIND GAMES!!!! I learned from you. I'm already a step ahead. Do NOT think you can sit there and actually think you can make me think that you love me and want to be with me again. I know it's not true. You've said it too many times. I know you love me but you love me because I am the mother of your son and I am your friend. DON'T TRY ME BOY!!!! I AM NOT PLAYING YOUR GAMES!!!!

              I jumped and then I accidentally flew away     Well on Monday I heard that Jump Little Children was going to be at Manifest. So I talked to Hayley almost immedietly and she asked me if I wanted to go and my response you ask?   HELL YUHHHHHHH   So today we ran errends and then we went up there and I saw the one guy Matt. I think I almost drooled on myself. Then they played a couple of their new songs and I was like "OH I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!! I LOVE YOUR MUSIC!!!!!! I LOVE YOUR VOICES!!!!! I JUST OH LOVE YOU!!!!" But I didn't say it. (::latin accent::)~~>But I said it with my.....eyes!! Im a crack monkey I swear. Well after the show they stared signing autographs and I wanted to get something signed so me and hayley got our progress reports signed. Well I got a piece of paper signed. ::plasters paper against computer screen:: SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!??? It was hilarious what they said on Hayleys. But yeah I'm in a good mood.

             AH! WHY! WHY DO I DO THIS TO MYSELF!!      Sometimes I seriously make myself sick with the way I feel. I went to Jerry's to show him the recent pictures of Joshua because you know he wants to see them as well as Brenda and all that.   So OK, I knew he was sick and wasn't gonna give me a big ol' hug and kiss like he usually does but damn I walked in his room and didn't even get a fucking HI!! That hurt a little bit. I mean he could have been at least poliet and said HI! I say hi to people even when I don't feel good.   Although he gave me a small hug and smiled at me. So I gave him the pictures and tried that stupid small talk but that didn't work. It's just like he's only nice to me when he wants to fuck and UGH. I mean that's just how it feels. It makes me feel like a cheap whore and it makes me want to cry. Seriously. I hate that.  I hate all these damn feelings and I hate having to feel them. I mean I'm not used to them all because I always got drugged up so that I couldn't feel. I don't want to feel but I can't do pills anymore because Hayley would kick my ass. But I want to. I just wanna be in a stoned stupor. I don't want to deal with them.  I don't want to have to deal with the fact that Mother's day is coming up and I have nothing to show for it. God that makes me feel like shit. I can't take it! I want to just give up. I don't feel like faking anymore. But I don't want to be real either. I don't want to be anything.  I'm tired of Jerry acting the way he does. He needs to get his shit straight. I'm tired of the feeling of hopelessness. Hayley keeps asking me what I want. What would make me feel better. Wanna know? Happiness. Pure true happiness. That's it. And to be satisfied with the person that I am. That's not much to ask for right??     Mood: Hurt Song: Left out ~ Shinedown

             What a fucking blast!!!!     Prom was a fucking blast!! The music were fabulous. All my buddies were there. The guys were OH SO PRETTY!! The girls were simply beautiful. It was great. I danced for four hours straight. Me and my buddy Mary danced with each other and these two really hott guys. And it's always nice to get in between two guys and dance with them. Kinda whorey like but special like!! LOL. The guys at my school can actually dance I was really surprised. And it was really nice that guys were asking me to dance. Because YES this white girl has rhythem (omg i forgot how to spell cuz i know that's not right lol). The only thing that got on my nerves really was this guy who basically was interested in me for the fuck last year was there. GET THIS: hasn't noticed me alllllllllll year. I've said hi to him just cuz, looked at me like a worm, saw me at the prom SMILED acted liked i existed and asked to dance. I did and then he was like lets go sit and talk I was like how bout no! I hated that how all the sudden guys act like you exist when they haven't acted like you're alive alllll year! How stupid. And it was really funny at one point me, mary, candy, and kari were all dancing in a line together and like 30 other girls joined us. Flashes were going off everywhere!! Oh wow I'm scatter-brained when I walked in the doors with my date i heard "OMG ITS EMILY" ::flashes go off eveeeerrrrrrryyyywhhhere!!:: Me and my date Brandon were blind for a second.  After the prom me, Brandon, Torie, Scott, JC, Mary, and Lorenzo planned to meet at McD's and then go bowling. Torie and her man NEVER showed up so we left them. We all pretty much figured they were making babies on the side of the road. So we all went to the bowling alley. Me and Mary kept dancing the entire time we were at the bowling alley. It was great. Then me, mary, and jc lined danced in the bowling lane! It was so funny. And I got a lap dance that I did NOT WANT!!!! LOL. My night was fabulous! But today (this is monday now) I had that STUPID STUPID POINTLESS GAY ASS AP ENGLISH EXAM TODAY! FOUR HOURS OF STRAIGHT RETARDEDNESS!! Me and Candy sat there trying not to talk the entire time. OMG the essays were straight stupid. The first one made no sense whatsoever. Why would I give a flying fuck about Lord Chesterfield and his.....damn....values. OH RIGHT I'M NEVER ALLOWED TO DISCUSS IT. TARDNESS!! LOL THE ANSWERS WERE EEEEEEAAAAAABBBBBBCCCCCDDDDDDD yeah how bout no!

             I feel the need to say I'm sorry     So yeah I'm in a fabulous mood today. I'm going to prom and really looking forward to it. I mean my dress is just awesome. My hair is gonna look so damn good when I finally get it done lol. I'll feel all pretty. I'm sure I'm going to have a great time. I'm going with my good friend Brandon. I was like so surprised when he asked me to go. It's OK that I was his second choice. But that's only because his first date wasn't able to go. But hey that's always a good thing. I wasn't going to go at first of course unless somebody asked me. Then BOOM I got asked lol. It was funny because I thought that he wasn't being serious I guess. So me and Brandon are going to go eat at Showmars instead of McDonalds because that was just a funny suggestion to go there because you get free food if you show up in your prom etire (sp??). Then we're going to make a "fashionably late entrance" because Brandon is so funny like that. After that we're going to meet his friends up at a bowling lane to go Midnight Bowling. That should be really funny all of us bowling in our prom stuff. Makes you wanna bring extra clothes man. But nooooo!! I can't wait to see everybody there. A lot of my senior friends of course will be at the prom. Man for 50 bucks this better be a kick ass prom fo real!! I mean the last three days the school sold tickets they bumped the price up to 65 bucks. Dude all the other schools were like 35 to 45 bucks. That's cheaper than ours. In the end though you end up spending over 200 bucks anyway because you want to look good lol. Oh well. It'll be fun.

      I can't even try to spiff up my blog right now I'm so just ugh and arg and ::scream:: OK see I'll love my best homie in the world Skittle with all my heart. All I want is her to be happy and if you look at the convo below I'm sure you can figure out why I'm feeling the way I am right now.  I am soooooo damn sick of trying to "let things happen." I'm tired of sitting idioly by and waiting on shit to happen. I've been there done that sick of it. But when I try to make things happen they BLOW UP in my face. Nothing works. I'm at a fucking loss. You know I'm pretty damn sure now Chris and Skittle are going to start dating now. YAY for them. I mean that honestly. As long as they're happy that's all that matters to me. But I still can't help the feeling of frustration and hurt I feel. I was pretty sure I'd have no chance with Chris at all. I knew that he was in all kinds of love with Skittle. And yet stupidly I tried to start something with him. Actually thinking something might happen between us. Wow how embarrassed am I?? Entirely. You know I'm really sick of trying. I'm sick of being fake. But I'm sick of trying to be real. I'm sick of it all. I'm ready to give up. I wish that things would work out for me. But usually they don't. That's my damn life. Every time I try for something it doesn't work out like I would want it to.  It's really sad that I cried over stupid ass bullshit like this. It's sad that I knew from the beginning I had no chance with him and yet I still fucking tried. Why? Why do I do this to myself. Here I am trying to jump back in to the dating scene and fuck I screw that up. Wow. How sad. I wish things would work out for me. I wish things were easier. But that can't happen. Too many things have happend to make the me the way I am. Sometimes I honestly wish I couldn't feel a damn bone in my body. I don't want to "feel" any more. I'm sick of "feeling." Having to "feel" puts me in a state of unbalance. It's times like these I would go back to popping pills or drinking into a state of stupor. It's destructive yes I know. But seriously I don't fucking care anymore. I've lost my first and only love. I've lost my son. I suck at trying to date. I suck at flirting. I suck I suck I suck. Yeah I know if Skittle reads this she's going to kidnapp me and yell at me because she hates it when I do this to myself. She hates that I drag myself down like this and beat up on myself. But you know what this is me. This is how I am. A sad miserable fuck. A fake fuck at that. I'm just so tired of trying. But I'm tired of fighting all my demonous battles. I'm tired of fighting with myself. I'm tired of fighting for things I can't have. I'm tired of trying for things I can't get. I'm tired of opening my mouth and letting things spill out when I know that they shouldn't. I'm tired of it all. Sometimes I really wonder why I'm living. Like seriously. What's the point? No you guys I'm not going to kill myself what would be the damn point. I don't want to end up hurting everyone else because I feel like I'm suffering. I'm really sick of crying because I highly believe I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life. I'm tired of that. I really truely am. I can't go on being fake but I can't go on being real. So what am I supposed to do?? I need help. I need to get all this out. But I can't seem to do it. I know this is turning into insessenct rambling but I can't help it. I'm breaking down and I can't figure out why! I think all the events that have happened to me in the past months are finally tearing me apart. Killing me inside. I'm dead on the inside. I'd like to feel without regret. I'd like to say things and not feel like stupid later. I'd like to be happy. I'd like to smile and seriously mean it. I'd like to feel that not everyone is judgiing me. I'd like to not feel so damn paranoid. I wish people would stop talking behind my back and start saying things to my face. I need to get away. Just leave for a while. Get my thoughts and myself together. That's what I need. Just to run away. I don't know where I'll go or for how long but I can't stay here any more. Not for right now. I mean, I'm not mad at anyone. No one has done anything to me to cause this. This is all  me . I'm just breaking apart and I really can't take it. This is not supposed to happen to anyone because it SUCKS. Beyond all beliefe. I wish everything could be straigtened out with a snap of my fingers. I wish that I didn't feel the way I did. I'm just tired. So very very tired. Sick of it all. I'm done. I can't do it. I don't think I can feel any more. I honestly feel so dead on the inside. And I just don't care.
