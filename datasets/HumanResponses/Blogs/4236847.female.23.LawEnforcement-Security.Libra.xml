      U know what? I think I hate Sunday! Sunday for me SUCKS! Haha that is becos I will be BORED as HELL. (But then again, who says Hell is bored? haha)  Anyway Sundays @ Home usually means staying inside my aircon bedroom either watching TV or surfing the internet (which Im doing right now). It's really no life. Haha I shld do  SOMETHING !  Forget it. We shall see next week whether I still be rotting inside my room. But then again, next Sunday I probably chill out with Jessie @ Sentosa.  We shall see.

      Friday @ Changi cHalet was fun! The BBQ was fun. even though there was some "uninvited" crasher. Haha ... referring to the bosses.... hehe.. i carn believe that I have MISERS for Bosses. First time i See SUCH MISERs in my life. Gosh anyway I din let HIM spoil the fun times for me.  Most imptly I had loads of fun with my colleagues. Prem was nutz. He led a grp to the Old Changi Hospital. he also managed to capture some footage of the scary haunted place. To my surprise, they caught some sound footage of some ppl chanting sutras inside the haunted area. According to witnesses (haha Jothi and ppl) and the footage inside my DV, there were 2 persons in some religious costumes with lighted white candles chanting inside the premises of the Old hospital. When they tried to enter, they were stopped by the chanters who asked them "Looking for Something?". They had then backed off after the dogs were released. Fizah was scared out of wits....and she started running cos of the dogs. Freaky scary.   IM GLAD I WAS PLAYING MAHJONG AND DIN JOIN THE HAUNTED TRAIL WITH THEM. HOLY SHIT!    And during the 1 day n 1 night chalet , i realised I like someone even better cos he can really take care of ppl well. Not sure whether i shld be writing this down inside cos Im afriad someone who knows him might read this bloody blog of mine. Aha!  He can cook! He can take care of people very well. He is a good person! But unfortuately he has a GIRLFRen so I think I better not think too much and GET ON WITH MY FREAKY LIFE.  Will get some fotos of the chalet!

      Har! This topic has been on my mind for pretty long. I have been formating the pointers in my head for some time.  When I was sweet 16, I used to think dat its cool to be  SINGLE . I would scone and frown @ frens whose other half would call at every constant 1 min to ask the location, whether meals have been taken and etc. Isnt this a constant irritation? Worst still, this is like "bugging" from a robot. I would cheer for Singletons! The freedom.....the freedom....the carefree life I can lead by being SINGLE.  Now @ 24, I seem to have a different opinion. If only I can have someone who would call or sms me to ask me what I am doing this current moment. That would be nice.   I think I need some company.

       Im Bored! Seriously Bored. U have no idea how boredom can kills and crushes one's life. Aha! Perhaps Im not the vert first person who realised this. Im sure there are many people who realised this already. Im so sick of SUndays. Its alway so boring. I have nothing to do except to eat, sleep, surf net, watch tv. Even now, there is nothing interesting on the Bloody TV!Perhap I should really consider my options to making my Sundays an interesting and happening day instead of blabbering my arse off and nothing is still being done. Haha!
