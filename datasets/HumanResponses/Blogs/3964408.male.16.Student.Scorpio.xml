       Well hello there.   I'm going to Dream (for those of you who are straight, or don't live in Denver, Dream is a gay club) tonight, and I'm going to find a guy for me. Seriously. It's been way too long. I need one. Last week there weren't very many hot guys there. Hopefully it'll be better this week.&nbsp;&nbsp; :)&nbsp;   Oh. Some crappy news. You probably could care less, but&nbsp;I care a lot. They hired some annoying older (well not that old, but older than ony of the people who already work there) woman at my Starbucks. I'm not a fan. Plus, she has really ugly hair. Eww. The good news is, they also hired a shift supervisor who seems perty cool. He's probably in his 20's, and I'm guessing he's gay by the semi-sparkly belt he was wearing when I met him.   Any way. Thats all for now. If I get to Dream really early again tonight, I'lll probably make an entry. Otherwise, see ya later.

       Well hello there.   Sorry to go so long without a post. Its just been a boring week. I haven't had anything to write about. I still don't, but I'll figure something out. Hmmm...   Well...we start selling lunches at starbucks tomorrow. Wooo. No, its not exciting, it just means more work for me. Oh well. The good news is, I never have to leave the store. LOL. Because, you know, the two minute walk over to Einstein's to buy lunch is sooo rough. Gah.   I have no news. At all. How sad.   P.S. I still need a boyfriend...someone needs to hook me up.&nbsp;&nbsp; :)

      Well hello there.   12:30ish AM. Wow. What can I say. I don't want to sleep because I'm at my dad's house and I have to share a room with my sister. How wierd. BTW...I'm not out to my sister, so that makes things all the more awkward. Anyway...Gah. I'm so bored. You have no idea. Oh oh oh! Wanna know something cool?? I got a free pass to see The Village next Thursday! It's good for two, and I need a date. Go ahead and fight for it. You know you wanna.   Ewww. I just got the Fanta song stuck in my head. That seems to happen a lot. Surprisingly, it doesn't make me want to buy a Fanta. Hmmm...That's a sign of some really bad marketing. "Don't you wanna...Fanta?"&nbsp; "Mmm hmm."   Mmmm...Dr. Pepper....   Moving on...to what, I don't know. But we're moving. And Moving is always, well most of the time, good.   In other news, Mark needs a boyfriend. PS, I'm Mark.   In a related story, well not really closely related, Ashley never called me back when she said she was going to. Not gonna lie, I'm pissed. Grrr. I'm putting on my angry face now. :-($)   To wrap it up...fuck it. I don't need to wrap it up.

       Well hello there.   Ugh. That's all I have to say about that. Today is the friggen longest day. I was out 'til 2:30 last night, got up at 7:15 this morning, and I still have my dad's birthday dinner left. eww.   But hey. It's all worth it. I was up all night last night dancing on the stage at dream. I thought I was making a fool of myself, but apparently not. Some guy saw me on my way out, and he was like "Hey. Your a good dancer. You were tearin' it up tonight". I think his name was Randall...maybe. Thanks for the confidence boost Randall.   BTW...If anyone knows a gay boy who might wanna meet me, let me know. LOL. No, seriously. I'm friggen desperate.

       Well hello there.     I'm way excited....well it's not really that exciting. I'm here @ Dream waiting for people to show up...and its not happening. The good news is I got here so friggin early that no one was here. And believe me, I needed that. I just had to fill up my car with gas. $23.08. That was rough. Anyway.     &nbsp;   I'm trying so hard to come up with something to say, but its not happening. That means its time for me to stop writing. I'll be back tomorrow.

       Well hello there.   Hmmm...Well if I'm not alive in a little bit, blame it on the massive tornado. Just kidding. The county I live in is in a tornado warning for another five minutes. Wish me luck.&nbsp;   In other news, my life is boring. Nothing exciting has happened since my last entry, so yeah. But tonight is par-tay night. Time to go to Dream and find me a hot guy. I'm way excited. I'll let you know how it went ma√±ana. (Tomorrow for all you non Spanish speakin' folk.)

       Well hello there.     &nbsp;   Wow. Summer, and I have nothing to do but this. How sad. Moving on. Fast. &nbsp;     &nbsp;   Work was slightly shitty today. And by slightly I mean serioulsy. I left an hour&nbsp;late because my new boss is retarded and thought&nbsp;he would leave for the bank right before i was supposed to leave. If I had left when i was supposed to, there would have only been one person on the floor. How nice. &nbsp;     &nbsp;   On a slightly happier note, Im not hungover today. Thats always good. Anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Thas all fo now. Hasta.

       Well hello there.  This is one of those times when I'm wishing I had someone to cuddle with. But I don't. Somehow in the last couple of days, I've gotten myself in to this shitty little depression. It didn't help today that I got bitched out by my friend for drinking too much. But seriously, I don;t know what the deal is. Hopefully it's one of those little things that will resolve itself in a week or two. Preferably before school starts on the 18th. Eww. I think a good boyfriend could solve all my problems right now. Anyone know a good gay boy in Denver? Help me out.

      Well hello there.  All I want to know is, who the hell watches that bull shit? Gah. Kelly is the most incredibly stupid woman in history. Don't ya think, Reeg?  Anyway, I got up at the butt crack of dawn this morning to take my dad to the airport. No, it wasn't to be nice. It was so i could drive his X-terra. Woo.  My ADD brain is moving so fast this morning. New subject. I need to go get my hair cut, but the mofo's over at Antione Du Chez won't answer their phone. Alright. It's 9:23 right now. I'm trying again. So, I didn't get throught to an actual person until 9:26. And I had to listen to classical music the whole time. Eww. But, hey. I have an appointment for 11:15. Yeah.  Hmmm...That was odd. It sounded like there was a Jack Johnson song on that Oreo commercial. I would cry if someone as cool as Jack ever did a commercial.   Alright. Its time for me to do something productive. By that I mean stop writing in my blog and watch TV. Hehe. Later.
