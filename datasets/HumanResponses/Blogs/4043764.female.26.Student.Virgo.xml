        You're Sorority Slut Barbie!    urlLink   If You Were A Barbie, Which Messed Up Version Would You Be?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Ok. I like little web quizzes as much as the next slut, but is this necessary? I feel dirty looking at the god-damned thing... Naughty.

      This is the day where I talk about all things mundane. I will not have to pay rent for September because my landlord up in Somerville is going to be ripping into our kitchen floor. While this means we will not have a kitchen to cook in, I will have $700 to play around with that month. This is major, seeing as none of the consultancies have come through, and I've been living off of my last consultancy check for the past three months. F@*&amp;ing NGOs.  Anyway, last night I experienced the real "bling bling in the ATL" in midtown and buckhead. Britfriend took me to her current apartment building ["it's a condo... condo, dah-ling"] where they were doing some inefficient cookout [electric grill? come on.] I am happy that she's selling that place and moving soon.  She is moving from midtown chic to buckhead fabulous - into a five-star full-service condominium with "views" of the city (read: overpriced apartment where you strain to see beyond the smog)- once she sells the condo in midtown.   The buckhead place had a little opening event with open bar, hors d'oevres. Total upscale bullshit. As usual, got hit on by 1,001 gay men who think I am "gorgeous". I think if I hear another man say, "Girl, you are so byoootiful... If only I were straight..." I will -  Hell, I don't know what I will do. A compliment is a compliment. I'll take it wherever I can get it.  So I meet this guy -let's call him Steve - who works at a very famous upscale hotel. He walks into one of the floor models, takes a look at baseboards, doors, etc. He comes over to me, hand at one side of his mouth and whispers,   "Girl, it's like Target in that bathroom."  "You mean, like lots of aromatherapy candles and cheap towels?"  "No, like look at the baseboards. They look like painted plywood. The doors are flimsy plastic. This could never fly at the [very famous upscale hotel (VFUH)]."  "Oh, I see what you mean. The details."  "Yes, honey. It's ALL about the details." A flick of the wrist emphasizes his point.  As Steve hisses his disdain about the quality of the craftsmanship of the apartm - I mean, condo - a woman with a nametag, decent suit and frizzy, sun-weathered hair comes over. She knows this guy because she, too, worked at VFUH once upon a time.  "Hey, what do you think?" "Oh, girl! It's faaaaaaabulous! Doesn't hold a candle to VFUH!" "Thanks. Hey, whatever happened to that gorgeous guy I went out on that date with..."  I am embarassed for her and walk away. I can tell that Steve does not want to answer that question. I later find out that this gorgeous guy who took her out on the date, takes lots of women out on dates. And he is out of her league. He was having an off day. I feel even sadder. At least she gets asked out on dates by people who are out of her league.  But I perk up. Because 1,001 gay men think I am gorgeous. I can't believe that I missed  urlLink Kerry's  speech to find this shit out.

      Remember that meeting I *so* dreaded yesterday? Well, today is actually the day; I was misinformed. So I have to go in - despite this being my day off - and endure this meeting. I'm sure a lot of people feel this way, so I am probably saying nothing new: I hate most meetings. Even if there is an agenda, there has to be a facilitator who can cut that shit off when it gets too unfocused. I think I spend the majority of meeting time making to do lists, thinking about what I could be doing elsewhere. Maybe I just have a problem paying attention.    And I left this DVD in britfriend's car -  urlLink City of God , I highly recommend it. Because she doesn't like driving the full distance to my house (it's maybe about 15 minutes), I have to meet her at a train station halfway between us (will take me about half an hour because I am carless). She's always late.    So I am in for a big treat today, let me tell you.

      A couple of years ago, I bought a bed. It is a firm, pillow-top mattress, full-size. I bought that size because a queen sized would not fit the staircase to the basement apartment I lived in. [the sketchiest salesman in the world tried to sell me the bigger bed: "can i ask you something? will it really make a difference in space - 4 inches this way, 3 inches that way? i wanna get you into a bigger bed today... can i get you into a bigger bed?" he used my name a lot too, which really creeped me out...] Anyway, I slept in the smaller bed for less than 8 months.  I moved back to ATL to be with the boy. I put it in his guest bedroom. And I went to Sierra Leone.  I planned take it up to school this fall, but decided it would be best to move with less, especially since I'll be living in an attic space and have NO idea whether it would fit the staircase. I have asked and been re-assured by my new roommates. I do not trust anyone's spatial judgment, however.  One of my friends offered to buy it if she likes the looks of it. I am sure that she will. When I broached this topic with boy, he did not care. He told me that the bed could go - he did not need it. This morning, he asks if he can match the price. I tell him that she gets first dibs -   As I write, I realize that this is so stupid. Scratch this off of any list of important things.

      Am back in the office, trying to be inconspicuous in the low, no-privacy cublicle. I really struggled to get out of bed this morning and I am pretty sure that I did finally roll out because I have a meeting later today. It's not a required meeting for me, but I was told that "it would be nice" if I attended. So, I'm caving.  Did not have too much of an opportunity to watch the entire convention last night. As I mentioned before, my mother spent much of her cheer-up time yesterday talking about politics. She was so excited about Obama and Sharpton, I felt like I had to see the two in action. I have been following Obama's campaign in Illinois, so I know a lot about him and his views. And Sharpton, well... he's Sharpton. But a pizza party, complete with margaritas and poolside chats kind of eclipsed the DNC event.  Good. I have the opportunity to listen to some West African French.  Attends! Je viens. Snicker.

                   Just talked to my mother... I, self-proclaimed daughter from hell, had to cheer her up. She was feeling a little sad. Anyway, as she began to cheer up - basically, I just got her talking about politics and C-Span - she told me that  urlLink Charlie Rangel  came into her store. This is sort of interesting because her store is in South Carolina. Anyway, my brother and sister-in-law often help mom out by taking over the reins during the weekend and evenings. My brother was there at the time (he's the best celebrity spotter out there). Charlie Rangel comes in and is like, "How are you doing, young man?" [this whole young-looking thing runs in our family; my brother is 35, which is certainly younger than Rangel, but not all  that  young...] My brother  responds: "Doing fine, Mr. Rangel, sir..."

      I woke up with stomach pains, so I am "working" from home today. Always have to use quotes because I am volunteering my proposal writing skills to one of these non-profit organizations. Today, I wish I were feeling more entrepreneurial because I need more cash before I start school. I guess I need to send in dumbed down resume.  In other news... a friend of mine who works near the boy suggested that I post a sarcastic "employee of the month" blog about him. Last night, I designed one which featured a picture of him fishing and lots of references to his playing grab-ass with co-workers. Perhaps I am being vain (in thinking that more than 2 friends read this thing) and a little sympathetic to the boy's indecisive cowardliness (the only real reason someone could give me up as a girlfriend/potential wife) - but I became worried that he would be devastated if he ever found the post. So, no employee of the month post... for now. It depends upon how much venom snake lady wants to spew later.  Last night, I had this conversation with atlblingbling, where I revisited the whole "what does he mean, he is not trying to replace me?" conversation... Of course, he can't replace me!  What other girlfriend would give up her reasonable level of comfort to sit in a hollowed out boat for 12 hours out of the day - for a whole week - to  urlLink fish in the Amazon , be blistered by the sun (for the record, I - with all this melanin in my skin - got SUNBURNED), be attacked by flying fish and be at the center of a piranha feeding frenzy? [the fucking princess is afraid of fucking termites...]  What girlfriend would watch  urlLink TVLand  - Chips, Dragnet, and Emergency - drink beer with you all night and provide critical commentary about gender identity and class? What girlfriend helps you write your thesis when your ass is under fire by your advisor, you have three days before the deadline (and it's so good that it later gets you an "A" and a nomination to present your thesis to the entire school)? What girlfriend nearly carries your drunk, heavy ass home after she's drunk you under the table? What girlfriend would practically beg you to go to the golf course with her? What girlfriend flies to  urlLink Togo  (ok, granted, it was from Nigeria) to meet you on Valentine's Day? What girlfriend will sit with you and your junk and not even complain about that junk (maybe I complain a little, but I sure as shit didn't make you clean it up either)? What girlfriend has a fabulous time with you, even when you are wearing a bright orange tracksuit and driving a '66 cadillac (ok,that's kind of cool and not something I would have to *put up* with, but still...an orange tracksuit)? What girlfriend have you ever had who was funnier, cooler and more outspoken than I? What girlfriend does all this AND is an active participant in/contributor to *the* best sex you've ever had in your LIFE?  Somehow, this started out as a sentimental thing and got a little dirty - I guess I should end...

       Laid-back interview   So I had the interview. They called me 45 minutes later than scheduled, as is the custom of  urlLink international NGOs  - they're always putting out fires... Actually, they somehow missed a digit in the phone number and my cell phone didn't ring (I have no idea what that's about). The first question: So. Let's just get to it. Why aren't you still working with the last organization you worked with? A: Well, my contract ended.  HR: Oh, let's be real here (he really said this). You know what I mean. Why aren't you still working with them? Weren't there other opportunities? Did something happen?  Me: There weren't any opportunities that would utilize my experience in monitoring, evaluation and research, actually. I am only looking for some short-term opportunities before I start my work on my doctorate.  HR: Oh, okay. Fair enough.  Anyway, after a few leading - and rushed - questions by the HR person ("so I know I asked you this already, but I want to know what your *sector* is. In other words, I'm asking if you would consider yourself a generalist or someone with a single sector of experience...") You know what the answer is.  He was in such a rush to get off the phone -- our interview started about 45 minutes late -- that I had to ask him, "Hey hold up, Tex. Is this still supposed to be a two-month assignment with the same terms of reference or what? 'Cause I do have to start school in September (as I noted in my cover letter, which I am not convinced that he read...)"  "Funny that you should mention that. That WHOOOLE thing has changed. Now, there is going to be this senior level person writing the reports at HQ and then some junior folks who'll be out in the field collecting the data that the senior person needs. Is that something you'd be interested in? Collecting some data for someone else who sits in an air-conditioned office in Big City, USA?" Yes, HR Director, I'll do anything... Sadly, I will, because I want to work somewhere different and do something different and possibly make a small difference, while getting paid the piddling UN rate.  Obviously I am embellishing a bit, but you know what I'm talkin' 'bout.    So - pop culture critic time. Drums puh-leeze. Today's topic: OPRAH .    Though I find myself sucked into the  urlLink Oprah  charisma from time to time (alas, I'm a sucker for that aw, shucks Clinton charm too), I do bristle at the show's topics, especially when I am not in the US. I've probably watched more Oprah in Africa than I have in America, really (and you, digital satellite television, I love you most of all). In these settings, I wonder about her relevance - American women on her shows will battle with their issues of control and power in ways that seem unimaginable in say,  urlLink rural Sierra Leone . For instance, women cope with life and lack of control by binge eating, sexual addiction, binge shopping, and being overly controlling in their homes... I am not sure what the equivalent is in the typical (i.e. not wealthy) household in the "developing world", if there is any at all.  Interestingly, a dear friend from Hausaland -  urlLink Kano, Nigeria  - approached me once with his theories about African American women. His research had been based upon cultural analysis of the  urlLink Cosby Show  and Oprah - he said, "Here, we think black women are the heads of households in America. Look at  urlLink Claire Huxtable . And Oprah... she lives with Steadman and he is the house-husband. Now those are some empowered black women. What was your household like?" This friend is a gender specialist, so I just said to him, "Yeah, that's how we run thangs in the US of A. Rock on." Ladies, gentleman, we know that these are idealized gender roles, the ones that are represented on television, but they are interesting representations, no? They do, however, make us look like the bizarro world that we are not.  My friend atlblingbling would be pleased to hear that today's Oprah featured  urlLink George Michael , who is, undoubtedly [giggle] making his comeback. After putting his hand in the air (and waving it as if he truly did not care) he yelled, "Go on, get nostalgic." Same rhythm as "go oprah, it's your birthday..." And he rocked "Father Figure". Yes, girls, he rocked it, with requisite Rubenesque black lady back-up singers. Atlblingbling performed this song at a karaoke bar in a quaint coastal town a few weeks ago. She gave an excellent and inspired performance. I wanted so badly to be her not-so-rubenesque back-up singer. Maybe next time.  So, Thursday's episode will feature Oprah doing some bargain shopping ("And on the next Oprah, my first trip to urlLink  Costcoooooooo ..."). Isaac Mizrahi will be performing ambush makeovers at  urlLink Target  (how else will Mizrahi make HIS comeback?) Some amusing visual images that I'll probably miss - Oprah wearing sunglasses (as if we can't tell that it's her?) and piling up on the 80-pack toilet paper. Mizrahi scaring some woman shitless as he crashes into her Target dressing room with a striped turtleneck. And, the best of all: Oprah being forced to undergo check verification - because  we know  the filthy rich *never* carry cash...

      So, I've picked up a new book,  The No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency , by Alexander McCall Smith. I had not heard much about it before I picked it up, but I need a little more fiction in my life. And it's about a woman in Botswana who runs a detective agency. How cool is that?    Anyway, since it is possible that penises will make more than a couple of appearances in my "journal", I thought this an appropriate and funny passage:    "...He was always looking at her and smiling encouragingly, although she was two years older than he was. He tried also to make sure that his leg touched hers, which angered her, and made her shift in her seat, away from him.    But worst of all he would undo the buttons of his trousers and point to that thing that boys have, and expect her to look. She did not like this, as it was not something that should happen in Sunday school. What was so special about that, anyway? All boys had that thing.    At last she told Mma Mothibi about it, and the teacher listened gravely.    'Boys, men,' she said. 'They're all the same. They think that this thing is something special and they're all so proud of it. They do not know how ridiculous it is.'"

      Today I have an interview with a relief organization based on the west coast. The interview is for a consultancy in Afghanistan; I would work with staff there to better mainstream gender into their relief programs.   I am fretting a bit about the assignment because I start school mid- to late-September. Plus, I am still in Georgia and would have to move up to Massachusetts before going out to Afghanistan. And... most of my stuff is in boy's house. Dunh dunh dunh... Here I go again, jumping the gun. Who's to say that I would even get the position?

       TV SHOW - TRADING SPOUSES   Tonight, I watched an encore presentation of "Trading Spouses": Meet Your New Mommy. This show was a fascinating look at race, class and gender and how they intersect. The previous sentence is about as academic as this gets...  As a budding anthropologist, I could not help but read this as an unabashed look at race and class in America. A synopsis: working class African-American mommy (Mela) is switched with upper-class white American mommy (Tammy). Mela gets new, rich Japanese American cosmetic surgeon as her partner (and it's a two-fer because his mother, Nana, does *all* the housework and cooking - we later learn that Nana sets the coffee pot at night so that Tammy does not have to do it herself AND so that she can have a sleep-in...)  Tammy's new partner is the talkative, low-key (and cost-conscious) medical suppply supervisor, Anthony.  The contrast between the families' neighborhoods and lifestyles is so stark that Tammy, gazing out her window at her new lower-middle class neighborhood, wonders: "Is there even a place for me to work-out here?"  Okay - a little aside. I cracked up when Tammy said that she brings  urlLink positivism  to the relationship - maybe it's because I've only heard this used in academics. Somehow, I don't think Tammy is a hardcore Comte fan.  I am focusing a great deal on Tammy because she really is the most interesting character to me in this episode - she is demanding, condescending, pampered - and she wants to "meet every person in the world." This is her way of telling Anthony that she was excited about being part of a black family and committed to promoting diversity by shaking lots of colored people's hands. Perhaps the phrase that best summarizes her outlook on "racial understanding" is: "You know, my husband is Japanese." Yes, Tammy, you are a pioneer, well before your time.  For most of the show, I was thinking - is it some coincidence that the working-class black woman is represented as nurturer, not only to her own children but to Tammy's children as well? [There is a scene where Mela is seen putting together one of those thousand-piece puzzles with Niko (Tammy's son) and Niko says: "My mother would never do this with me..." America's heart breaks for the child who has everything except the love and affection of his mother. Tear.    BOY NEWS - VENOM ENSUES  Still dealing with the aftermath of the "big break up with boy". The new catchphrase with he who spent the last four years of his life convincing me that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me (*SCARY*): "I am not trying to replace you." Which I translate to: "I AM trying to replace you and it's fucking hard as dick." He is dating the lite, calorie free version of me - a physical similar but not nearly as good as the original. (I go from self-hating to self-adoring when I talk about this guy, please bear with me.)  Anyway, as he was dating said downgraded version, he visited my apartment a few times to drop off mail and whatnots, did the whole clingy sideways hug thing (hiding a very erect penis, no doubt). Let it be said: I can be quite the source of arousal.  For some reason, this turned into weekly ritual and I had to end it ("don't touch me anymore, boy"). This, of course, created more longing on both our sides... The next thing I know, he was bringing over an installation disk and bam, his hands are under my shirt, in my pants, he tells me that he can't resist me blah blah...   "Oh, yes... this is so wrong... [grind] You aren't going to tell anyone, are you?"  "Who would I tell?" "I don't know. My girlfriend?" "How can I tell? I'm not even sure who she is." "But you're really smart. I'm sure you'll figure it out..."  The next day... I don't know why he came over this time, but I guess it doesn't really matter. I actually walked away at first and he - to use a trite phrase - was practically begging for it. I tried to do dishes (he knew I was feigning disinterest because I HATE washing dishes), the penis made an appearance, the rest is between him and me and, like, 10 other friends who've been hearing me agonize about this punk. Does a man who claims to be readjusting to a new relationship (with a person he claims to like) make the same "mistake" with the ex two days in a row? Does our little indiscretion mean anything other than he gets to have his cake and eat it too?   I wanted him pretty badly and contributed to his little fall from grace in little princess kristin's head (apparently he told her, and since he doesn't lie unless it's by omission, she knows that *something* happened). We have a lot of unresolved issues, and I think this MIGHT have something to do with my clitoral confusion. But I am wondering... who am I to think that I am going to get some resolution by playing professor hookup j. horndog?   Sadly, at the end of the whole thing, he was all pissed off about how he might be perceived as an asshole by princess kristin - and did not seem to care about her feelings too much. (I call her princess because I fantasize that she, his same cubicle/co-worker, is this whiny - i've heard her voicemails, I would not be surprised to hear her saying "mister... have you seen my puppeeeeeee?" - high-maintenance buppie who sleeps on a mattress with a pea underneath and stuffed bunnies on top.) But boy has never been really good about communicating so maybe he didn't mean it that way...  He used to be so nice.

       QUESTIONS FOR ME?  I know I'm putting a lot of personal stuff out there for y'all to read, but politics, television show reviews and broken relationships need to be exchanged for something else - at least for a few hours. There must be some things I am holding close or simply forgetting. Does anyone have any questions? If there is sufficient response (more than 5 or 6), I'll put all the answers in a post. Otherwise, I'll just personally respond to them. Deadline: Saturday, August 21, 8:00 pm EST (GMT -5).

       NO RACE? NO CLASS?  How will we choose our candidates? By ideologies alone? The  urlLink Illinois Senate race  sounds like a typical senate race everywhere: two wealthy, Ivy-educated men running for office. In this case, they are both African-American men, the first time in American history that this has happened in a Senate race. And when it's two brothers running against each other - oh, shit... what is a citizen to do? Well, I can tell you that Keyes is already playing the race card to sway votes: he  urlLink called  Obama's pro-life stance "the slaveholder's position" and mentioned something about "picking cotton". Oh, yeah, and  urlLink Keyes is running for God . (Perhaps God will be pissed when he loses.)  There's a great  urlLink article  about this race on the  urlLink black table .   Do the kinky stuff *after* you're in office and the economy is good.  The original Republican candidate, Jack Ryan, is out because of some kinky shit he's done. Fellas, a little advice: if you want to be a politician, please do not ask your wife - even if she is freakydeaky and discreet as hell - to stick her tongue up your ass, put a baby's bonnet on your head and spank you for being a naughty baby. The shit will come out if you divorce her; she will be embittered that she did not get part of the successful husband pie, she will be all "I got him here", etc. Unless your name is William Jefferson Clinton, it won't fly with the (generally) sexually conservative American citizenry.   Republicans fear  urlLink Obama  . He is a rock star, an example of the diversity that we keep hearing about but rarely see acknowledged in the efforts of our politicians (i.e. they treat us like we're all the same person). He is an African-American man who has an immigrant parent. He embraces ideals that are forward-looking, intellectually inspiring and pragmatic. His vision, I think, acknowledges past hurts and emphasizes the role of these in crafting a better future. He is idealistic.. and he lacks experience in drafting and moving legislation. But the people love him.   Alan Keyes,I, as God, pronounce Illinois your home state.   Keyes, an articulate man, is not even from Illinois. The Republican party are trying to pull a Hilary Clinton, except in this case, Keyes will be asked: Cubbies or White Sox? And perhaps this is an appropriate question, given their proclivity for sports celebrities as potential candidates: former Chicago Bears coach, Mike Ditka, was one of these. Mike Ditka. Can I write it again? Mike Ditka. I can see the thinking around that one: "Well, he  is  pro-life...And he has a show on ESPN radio... Let's give it a shot." It was lucky day for the people of Illinois when Ditka declined the offer.  Anyway, I think that part of the selection of Keyes is not in hopes that he'll win the seat (Obama really has had momentum coming off of the convention and has had weeks upon weeks of campaigning without any opposition), but to show Americans that the Republican party is "diversifying." It's a pretty sad ploy because the only thing he diversifies in the party is skin color. He is ideologically - to the point of idiocy - ultraconservative. Yet, he continues to be a caddy in the good ol' boy's club (apparently his house is on lien and he used to pay his own salary out of campaign budgets to make ends meet)...  Learn more about  urlLink Keyes  and see why it would bea shame to have this guy in office anywhere.

       NO MORE BOY.   He's going away, I've gone away, and, now, he is telling me that I need to forget about him and find someone who can treat me like I deserve to be treated. No, duh. Does he think that I've been  trying  to let him occupy my thoughts? And how fucking trite is  that  line, as if I don't know what I deserve and want? He just keeps re-surfacing like a bad, difficult-to-kick habit.  Of course  there is someone better or someone more suited or whatever one calls this particular complementarity that we all seem to seek.  But sometimes it's about what you want and not about what you need. Sometimes what you want is not always what's best. Sometimes, you just wallow in the depths of despair before things go back to normal and life is good again. For me, life is already better - I've been processing this whole thing for a while. Unfortunately, I've let myself become lazy at the same time: I'm just waiting for things to happen - school, sex, sex, work, sex instead of laying clever plans, crafting evil deeds... In the meantime, my thoughts drift to those  urlLink O'Charley's  moments with the boy and its locus - you know, at the corner of good food and good times.  Hey, he used to think the joke was funny.

       THE GHOST OF LOUISE ACQUAVIVA.   Last night the roommates and I talked. Hey, wait, does it sound like I initiated a conversation? Because we all really talked but I, typical wild honey, sat limp, a Virgo slacker, waiting to jump in and clarify issues or divert topics altogether. During this conversation, though, we two new roommates discovered that our house is haunted - or used to be - by a woman named Louise. Her nickname: "The Duck."  Apparently, M, the roommate who's lived here the longest was the one who got everyone on the haunted house kick:  "Hey, there's something a little creepy about this place. I wonder if it's haunted." "Oh, come on, you guys, there's no such thing as a ghost." "Are you sure?" "Oh, shut up." "Come on, you guys, this is so not funny... what if this place  is  haunted?"  Blah blah blah. You've seen the movie...  Soon after, M takes a cab back to the house from the grocery store. Her driver says: "Hey, this here is Louise's house...You ever hear about Louise? Louise Acquaviva?"  So, that night, she heard a chair being dragged down the hallway. She whispers to Louise, "Please, just go away. We're living here now. We're not going to do anything to the house." Her roommate, "Are you serious? Are you talking to a ghost?"  Ever since, every cab driver in the area pulls the "Hey, this is Louise's old house. You know... it was ten years ago, the worst storm I ever did see..." Or whatever Large Marge said to PeeWee.  Every Sunday, the Duck - so named because of her quacking voice - called a cab to take her to the church two blocks from her house. The cab drivers hated her for it, but in typical Masshole way, kinda respected the duck for her quirkiness. And, I think, they still feel her presence.

       HERE COMES THE SUN.     urlLink    A little sunlight in my attic room&nbsp; urlLink     So it does exist here. I was beginning to believe that Bush had already hatched his evil plan to block out the sun in the erudite northeast. I bet everyone's outside in hot pants and tank tops right now. I, on the other hand, am relishing the urban dreary of my room (the antidote for shabby chic, no doubt) by revising those nearly finished (yay?) grant proposals. Oh, I'll also be combing online news to provide you with up-to-date commentary on the issues that matter to YOU. What should be next? The Olympics?

       DECONSTRUCTING CELEBRITY MARRIAGE: THE NICKY HILTON STORY.  All cultural critiques – I  am,  after all, the “culture critic” who is seeking a home - will be based upon stories from the “news”, television, articles... I don’t have a television yet, though I will be paying for cable, it seems. Perhaps I should break down and invest in the television and get the money from the roommates later.      I am not sure where people who read my blog stand on this celebrity gossip drivel, but sometimes these stories elucidate more complex social phenomena. In this case, I'm just being one of the celebrity-obsessed hoi polloi. This Nicky Hilton business does not elucidate phenomena as much as it confirms what we already know: money matters often influence decisions to marry, and rich men like to marry young women. It is a bonus if the young woman is also rich. (On a side note, it is funny to me that atlbb brought this Nicky Hilton wedding to my attention; she really tries her best to keep out of the pop culture loop.)    Anyway, I read  urlLink this article  about the Vegas wedding… Nicky Hilton married a money manager from New York who is nearly 15 years older than she. They want you to know (in other articles I skimmed): It’s okay, though; they’ve known each other for years. And they had an 18-month courtship.            The quote from the article that I feel  demonstrates  the doomed nature of this younger woman/older man-rich man/richer woman relationship:             “this is a real, meaningful loving relationship…” Is there an assumption that these two got married for other reasons? Jesus-aged money manager + barely post-adolescent heiress = real, meaningful, loving relationship. Maybe we should get a  urlLink precocious South Boston-reared janitor     in here to work out this equation, it’s so mindboggling.             I’ve devoted too much time to this crud already.             DRUNK WHITE PEOPLE.     Last night, I met a fellow student. He was interesting, mostly because of his views on the world, his work in Ghana, his devoted and demonstrable solidarity with all black people he sees on the street, his aversion for bars… I asked him why he's been coyly avoiding entering bars in the square. He whispers, in mock secrecy: "Drunk white people." Well, how long  have you  been living in Boston?

       OF COURSE THE WEATHER CHANGES  when I arrive. Apparently, there was this warm, sunny, pleasant Boston before I came. Now, it's the dreary, cold, wet that I remember. I slept well, of course, with my windows open and huddled in my comforter. I guess it's good that I associate deep thinking and academic success with cold, depressing weather, because I sure as hell would not be able to start school in a month.  So far, nothing interesting to report, other than the fact that our kitchen floor is being held up only by some jacks and poles. The landlord has set up an electric burner and all kinds of other stuff for our "convenience" but I can't really see myself doing a lot of cooking in our makeshift kitchen. Perhaps this attitude will change once I begin bonding with the roommates.  I spent all day yesterday re-discovering my winter wardrobe, my books and my ridiculous decorating sense (I threw together some prints from my travels, and while everything looks appropriately "exotic" it also looks like I might be colorblind).  I met the landlord, who owns an antique plumbing business here. He has a penchant for wearing sunglasses, a hat, shirt tucked into a belted pair of shorts that are hiked up to his chest. This guy, with his Irish name and fashion sense, screams BOSTON. He says to me, "So are you going to [insert school name that sounds funny with a Boston accent - it's got a couple of "r's" in it]". "Yep." "Well, good for you. Good for you." I look at him, but his eyes are hidden by those highway patrolman sunglasses. I cannot tell if there is a particular reason that this is "good for me" but I just try to keep the chat alive. "I guess so." "Whatchoo studyin' over there?" "Anthropology." "Now, that's dinosaurs and stuff, right?" Damn, that Ross and his Friends. People now think all anthropologists and paleontologists are the same damn people. I pretend that I know something about anthropology. I honestly know little and hope that no one figures it out when I start classes. "Well, no I am looking at cultures. People." "Oh. Like ancient cultures and people?" "No, current cultures and people." Confused silence. Landlord's mouth is slightly open. "I'm gonna bring that electric two-eye stove over tonight or tomorrow. See how that works for you." *** I wished I had more to report, other than the fact that I am beginning to have the kinkiest, explosive boy dreams that I've ever had. No idea what that's about - my subconscious working out the sexual tension and issues between us? Perhaps. Or maybe I just need a little somethin' to get me over this once and for all. In my mind, I've been preparing for the real *end* for a long time (you would think the new girlfriend would have made that a lot easier, but noooooo), but there is this something that keeps me hanging on... Closure. I need to make it for myself.  Anyway, I think he is supposed to do his five-week trip to Congo and Angola starting this weekend. He told me that it would be the perfect opportunity to work out his issues, to be away and think about what he wants. Right. In the mean time he will be avoiding confrontation with the new lady - her majesty, her royal cluelessness. And probably with me, who knows what I am in his life... I know what you're thinking - who cares? It's just not that simple.

       TAX THESE CHURCH MOTHERFUCKERS.    urlLink    www.patrobertson.com&nbsp; urlLink     Sometimes, when I am feeling lonely and isolated, I like to listen to old comedy albums. Of course, my drive up had its lonely, dark, and pensive moments, so I popped in  urlLink George Carlin 's "What am I doing in New Jersey?" It's a little dated, but amazingly relevant to the current political climate. Just substitute the name "Bush" for "Reagan".  Anyway, there's this bit where he says:  " I don't know how you feel, but I'm pretty sick of church people. You know what they ought to do with churches? Tax them. If holy people are so interested in politics, government, and public policy, let them pay the price of admission like everybody else. The Catholic Church alone could wipe out the national debt if all you did was tax their real estate."   Eventually, he uses the phrase "tax these church motherfuckers", so I am not just being vulgar. Though I am known to be sometimes. So, what prompted this whole Carlin quotefest? I was reading the  urlLink Fall 2003  issue of Ms magazine (one of my new roommates' archived issues) and read a horrifying piece on the alliance between Pat Robertson and  urlLink Charles Taylor . As many of you readers know, I have a little more than a passing interest in this issue - when I was in Sierra Leone, I worked with Liberian refugees and Sierra Leoneans, many of whom experienced sexual and physical violence during the Taylor-backed wars. Here are some of the highlights of the article:      Robertson, through Freedom Gold Limited, an offshore company registered in the Cayman Islands but based at  urlLink CBN  headquarters in Virginia Beach, signed an agreement with Taylor and key cabinet members allowing the for-profit Freedom Gold to explore and receive gold mining rights in southeastern Liberia.     Robertson tried to get US support to send troops to uphold the "Christian" Taylor government, despite the accusations against the former Liberian leader: Taylor provided financial support to al-Qaeda and has been indicted for war crimes in Sierra Leone (he armed rebels who amputated the arms and legs of civilians in an effort to control diamond mines).     Robertson brokered a similar deal for diamond mining with Zaire's Mobutu, yet another sketchy dictator type - that time, he used money donated to non-profit Operation Blessing (propped up as a source of humanitarian aid) to mine for diamonds. Of course, Robertson called for an end to sanctions against Mobutu's government, even though this guy looted Zaire's treasury and killed thousands. [Sanctions are contentious for me, because they rarely hurt the thieving dictators; they often hurt the people who are supposed to be served by the government - somehow, I do not think this was Robertson's concern.]    Perhaps this would not be as interesting if he were some generally immoral businessman and not an evangelical Christian minister/self-proclaimed righteous man who regularly attacks so-called immoral people and "lifestyles". In response to 9/11, he said: "The focus of many in America has been the pursuit of health, wealth, material pleasures and sexuality...sadly, those in the churches have been as self-indulgent as those in the world." Yes, Pat, it is pretty fucking sad.* If anything, the attacks were a result of misguided, inhumane foreign policy initiatives and not of corrupt churches and Americans seeking sexual pleasure (or "sexuality" as he calls it. If we were all so sexually pleasured, perhaps we would not have to resort to teaching folks how to be terrorists and then get pissed off when they use those tactics on us. But that's not really the point.)  The point is: I suppose he is not self-indulgent with his little business deals with corrupt rulers? Or perhaps he has redeemed himself with the Great Redeemer by doing well financially, after coming to Tidewater, VA, with only $70 in his pocket? Somehow, he manages to urlLink  preach  - with a straight face and a pocket full of cash - that if you worship as a Christian and send him money, you, too, can be prosperous**.  My interest in his commentary on class and upward mobility is further piqued when I read - in the same  urlLink biographical sketch  that talks about his coming to backwater Virginia with that $70- that before this, he attended Yale Law, NY Theological Seminary,  urlLink Washington and Lee  (real southern elitist school), an exclusive all-boys  urlLink prep school , and is the descendant of two presidents (easy, when those people are the Harrisons, but you get my drift).... Somehow, I think that having such connections tremendously increases the value of $70.  I am not going to pretend that I have not gotten far because of my education and my upbringing, but I am not going to lie and say that anyone can have whatever they want, whenever they want it because we live in this society where  everyone  - or is it anyone? - has a "shot" at upward class mobility. I have witnessed too much in my various places of work and play that this is just not true...  So what do you say? Should we tax the motherfuckers?    * Let me just say, that I think there is nothing wrong with pursuing health, especially given its status as a human right...   **Small print is that the real secret to acquiring wealth is to eliminate debt, earn supplemental income (easy when you have non-profit status on your primary income earner), invest well (you know, in gold- and diamond-mining), manage money better...though the guy insists that you must be "blessable" first. And you need to donate "at least $20" to get your "free book" that explains how you'll become prosperous.

       SO I MADE IT...AND I THINK I HATE CONNECTICUT NOW.  I was a bit of a speed demon through Baltimore. Had an uneventful and expensive night's rest north of there - God knows where (they seemed to think they were part of Baltimore, but the signs said otherwise...) And I am too tired to make sense of the whole trip quite yet. I drove and drove until I got stopped at a bajillion toll booths. George Carlin has a funny bit where he says: "Why don't you guys just tally everything up, I'll write a check when I get to the state line..." I certainly felt that way in New Jersey. Shit, I felt that way in New York, Delaware, Massachusetts... I must've shelled out at least $20.  Traffic was horrible in CT. Every highway sign - you know, the ones that warn you about traffic and delays and missing children - said something like, "Expect delays from exit 12-42, 30 miles". Um, that means there's traffic EVERYWHERE, doesn't it? It means there's a fucking delay throughout the whole fucking state of Connecticut, not so? Ugh. I will go to sleep soon, thinking about all the stuff I left in the car and the fact that the car is parked by a meter. Ugh.  Oh, and though I keep making solid commitments to self about boy and derivative relationships with him, I did let him know that I arrived safely and appreciated the window fan for my attic room. He says that he decided that the original going away gift that I wanted was too impersonal and that he will send me something more "special". I just hope it's not another gag gift CD ("I knew you'd never buy it for yourself...") or surprise article of clothing...  I guess I'll be grateful for anything - it's the thought that counts.. Maybe his mother will see his depression for what it is. Really worried about him.  I am scatterbrained. Will rest now.

       I'M DRIVING AWAY.  Thanks to atlblingbling for her help in strategizing and getting the final items together. I am ready to move. Just need to do that final re-arranging in the car, vacuuming and I am out. Unfortunately, I woke up with an unbendable elbow. I can't do much because it hurts like hell, so I'll need to find my ibuprofen and dose up before the trip. Joanne was in from Switzerland for a tuberculosis meeting -  a huge surprise - so I went to see her at boy's. She looked great. It's raining (remnants of the tropical storm/hurricane from the gulf coast), so it should be an interesting way to go. More about the last interaction with boy later, which mostly consisted of awkward hugs (people were watching), his annoyance with my forgetting his vacuum and throwing prized tokens of love in the trash (to appease him, I have packed two posters that I would have otherwise left in his carport), and annoyance masking sadness ("What do you mean, you'll be driving at night? Joanne and I have conferred and we don't think it's a very good idea...")  We talked while atlbb cleaned out my fridge - he managed to show his concern, he croaked an "I love you" and "at least acknowledge that you've arrived, I need to know that you've gotten there safely"). Kinda sad. But I'm off to do better things. Like trying to find healthy food at gas stations sprinkled along 95.

       YOU KNOW I LIKE LIVE SHOWS.  I talked to the famed "Fire and Desire" Miriam last night. It was good. I want to talk to her more because she is giving me some more advice for moving on. She has three kids, a husband and is in graduate school. She is supermom. She was like, "I read your blog. Is this the same guy who put you through the wringer before?" Yes, I hang my head in shame for doing what I accuse him of doing: bringing drama to my life. I'm sure I'll be set straight the next time I talk to her. We've known each other since we were wee ones, and even though she's three days older than I, she seems to be infinitely wiser about how to release aforementioned drama.  Speaking of Mr Drama, boy called me this morning, says he got a message from me that was jumbled (I can't remember what I was saying honestly, I think it was something about the vacuum and some books). He would have called last night but it was too late - he went to the Prince concert with "co-workers". Second Prince concert this year. Bah, I do not like him when he tells me this. "Didn't you just see Prince in April?" "Well, yeah. You know I like live shows..." Whatever. But do you like Prince?  Oh, yes, I forgot to acknowledge the other person who made my day yesterday - shall I call her Aegyptress (this name might stick)? - when she gave me that bottle of Barbancourt (the one I probably should've gotten in place of that ridiculous boubou). It will be greatly appreciated in my new home.

       MIDNIGHT TRAIN FROM GEORGIA . I'm leaving. Last night I had a going away party of sorts; I sang at the lounge again. For some reason, those inked guys who run the show really like me. Or pretend that they do. Either way, they're pretty fucking charming. One of them announced that he was glad that whole milk existed and that he would masturbate while thinking about my singing. I'm summarizing his comments, which I think were probably delivered a bit better than I've done here, but yes, rock on. I'm sure it was part of the image. As much time as I have devoted to transcribing this bit of information, this was not the charming part. This was: "Young miss, it's been a pleasure meeting you. I really enjoyed your performance, you should definitely keep away from that Morrissey stuff from now on. I bought you a shot. You wanna taste my drink too?" Ok. So I am easily charmed.  Everyone sang a little bit. I was even impressed by a drunk graduate student rendition of some Eminem song. Atlblingbling, in usual fashion, sang a brilliant INXS - Mystify? I am going to miss hanging out with her. Her sister came into town and when she sang "My boy lollipop", I had to gush over the cuteness.  Forgive me if the details are blur - it was a long night.  So fast-forward to three in the morning. BIB gets the wine bottle open! I've been trying to open my discount bottle of wine for days! No fear... I didn't drink more than a sip because I was feeling the effects of the "shot" and some pretty poorly made margaritas. Correction: I am still feeling the effects of the shot and some pretty poorly made margaritas.  I guess I'll have to work it out with my packing and cleaning.  I hope atlblingbling was able to get up this morning for work. Aaaaaah.

       WHAT SIZE TRAILER DO YOU LIVE IN?  I am rarely offended. But tonight, I watched Trading Spouses again and I could not believe the cross-class exchange this time. I am not sure what I think about FOX and its brilliant programming, about their manipulation of difference, about their “otherizing” the poor.  Twice, I’ve watched the show, and they’ve put these pseudo-rich people and working class folks into these ridiculous living situations. I think that all they demonstrate in the end is that the nouveau riche are relentlessly shallow, despite their entreaties otherwise: “We’re down to earth, regardless of how we beautiful we are...” I am not going to pretend that the poorer woman was virtuous; she is insecure about her modest income and her “small” house. And she tries to mask it with sarcasm. Seeing her yard, I know that all those houses could probably fit on her property, but does she think that saying this is going to deflect the crude remarks from women with sprayed on tans and newly built pink stucco houses? It certainly did not prevent the rude comment from her neighbor: “Well, what size trailer do you live in?” Mean bastard.  Let me just say that I hardly think that a bunch of bottle tanned Californians have the room to pass judgment and be all elitist because she makes a living cleaning teeth. And since when was yacht skipper something to brag about? It’s like being a butler, right? Pays really well, but you’re still a manservant.  In the past two swaps that I have written about, the two “wealthier” mothers were both particularly preachy about diet. As a public health person, I guess I can understand their concern (the families they move into are overweight) but condescension – and downright pushiness – often  accompany their advice. It kind of reminded me of something I once wrote about immigrants to the US and how most of our ideas about social work are a result of women’s movements of the late 1800 – early 1900s.  Under the guise of helping immigrants from southern and eastern Europe assimilate into “native” American society, wealthy women reached out to immigrants from the “weaker stock” and showed them how to run “hygienic” homes. Forget that they made very little money and had one sink for several people; they needed to learn how to be CLEAN. Very little has changed. Today, middle- and upper-class women perform these same duties in poorer communities; I think this is salient in the show, though I would hardly call their low-carb entreaties social work.  I thought of some other pop culture favorites where rich women help poor: Weezy and Helen at the cornily named “Help Center” on The Jeffersons, for example. One episode that sticks out is the one where a sex worker comes in to the Help Center with bruises. Louise and Helen want to help her (her pimp was beating her) but are intimidated by the pimp. I don’t remember exactly what the hooker said – lost those transcripts – but it was in the vein of “Look, you rich ladies try to come in here and do good. And then you go home to your comfy little houses and feel all content with yourselves because you helped some poor hooker…”  All I can say is I am tired of this McMansion worship, big cookie cutter house with a small garden, miles from anything other than a strip mall. I live in Atlanta, and I think I’ve seen enough of this sparklesparkleiwantalotofshit stuff to last me a lifetime. “This house is so cramped. I can’t believe that three people have to share this shower…” Or my favorite:“I bought my house for three hundred thou and now it’s worth one point one mil.” Please, take a number and line up behind the other people who think anyone gives a shit.  Our class structure and our ideas about class in America inform how we think about money and the people who make a lot of it. We think that people who have “made it” are going to be down-to-earth, going to be us, hardworking people whose efforts are rewarded with increased income. This is something we can achieve. This show, on the other hand, makes us hate these fuckers. Though I doubt Rupert Murdoch would ever try to stir revolution, maybe this show is supposed to rouse people, get them to think about issues of social justice, the effects of globalized capitalism, and economic depression in rural areas?

       EVERYTHING YOU DO IS SUCCESS.  From the lyrics archive of one of my favorite artists. I imagined that I went to the Prince concert last night instead of sinking into my bed, windows open, crickets chirping... I had this amazingly sweet moment with my "boss" the other day, where she told me that I did excellent work, and would go far because I had instinct and was smart. It was nice and something that had not even thought about much. I guess not too many people come through and offer free technical services that are actually satisfactory. But also, I've never really thought about what "success" is or what "going far" means to me.  Anyway, the "successful" part of my morning consisted of sprinkling cleaning dust and elixir (aka ajax and comet bathroom disinfectant) on various surfaces, picking up a vacuum from boy's house - ugh, he had just come back from princess' lair and volunteered info about his non-sexual relationship, ugh, i swear i didn't ask - and making rental car reservations! So I'll pick it up tomorrow, pack up my things and leave bright and early Thursday morning.  It'll be exciting to make this journey alone. Though sometimes, I wonder how much I'd really be able to say to myself before I got bored.   VOTER REGISTRATION IN PHILLY.  In other news, talked to my friend, Brandon, who's up in Brooklyn. He wants to promote voter registration/ celebration/whatever up in Philly - using young adults of color - because PA is apparently crucial territory for defeating Bush this year. I might be passing through to see him and have that discussion about how we might coordinate this event and have it complement existing efforts. Does anyone have suggestions of prominent political figures who might want to be a part of such a thing? I can provide more info if anyone is interested...

       I AM CASSANDRA.  That was my nickname in high school. When I was a junior, I was in a calculus class that mostly comprised of seniors. Though they were seniors and had just a little bit more experience in the world, they never noticed that twinge in Mr. Blankenship-Brown's voice, the one that suggested that what he was saying might be on the test. In my typical Cassandra way, I would say, "Obviously this is on the test." He would reply, "Maybe so, but no one is listening to you. You're a bleeping Cassandra."  Thus is my fate. I am keeping my predictions to myself. But my main one right now is that boy really thinks that a woman would be with him, just to pass time... He thinks that a woman would put up with his whining, his baggage, his ex-girlfriendlove and cheating, no sex. AND that she would not expect that her efforts would result in something fruitful (i.e. committed relationship, sex, whatever). Humans are stupid and we have stupid notions. One that is gender-specific is this: "Oh, I can help him through this. I can be that solid rock. I can *change* him." Ok, whatever. It's bullshit. My other favorite: "I'm too good for her, she's putting up with me. I've got to let her love me." More bullshit. Grow some pubes, get some self-esteem, spend some time with yourself and figure out what it is that you want. Stop wasting other people's time.  Maybe I shouldn't write about relationships anymore.

       THIS WEEKEND. BAH.   I apologize for the blah blogs. Rick James story ended up not being as interesting as I expected. I mean, rock star marries someone who was barely legal when he started dating her? Oh, *that's* news. Yes, sometimes I read my own blog. And when I read the shite, it makes me wonder why I even thought to write.  Anyway, this weekend was all about organizing my stuff for the move. I don't have much stuff. I have not acquired much stuff. But for some reason, I spent at least 10 hours at boy's house this weekend. (There was no fellatio involved, but thanks for your concern.)  The first day, I went through my two closets' worth of stuff - and got this tremendous headache from all the dust. Perhaps I've mentioned that I am complete slob, but boy takes the cake. He's just got a lot of stuff and acquires more when he feels like crap. Lately, he's been buying A LOT of stuff.  The first few hours, I looked at clothes and decided that most things needed to be donated to the thrift store. These items included several articles of clothing purchased by boy during some rocky phases in the relationship. He would come in the room, look at the bag and say, "You're throwing THIS away too?" "Well, I don't wear it." "You know, I put a lot of thought into these gifts." "I know, but I'm moving to Boston. When would I wear an intricately hand-embroidered nylon Haitian boubou? I would look like Mrs. Roper." He takes the garish dress and rubs the fabric between his fingers. He gave it to me 3 years ago when he came back from winter break in Haiti (for thesis work), as a peace offering. He had broken my heart and went away. I went to Montreal; I had tried to forget about him. And then he came with this boubou. It was in a Barbancourt box - best rum ever - so imagine my surprise when I pulled out the dress.  "Maybe Paula would wear it, you know, since she's pregnant and all..." "Nylon? She might be pregnant, but she hasn't lost her mind." "Ok, maybe you're right." I later showed it to atlblingbling, who snatched it up immediately: "My mom would love this. She would be all, 'wow! it's hand-embroidered! and gee, it's beautiful.'" Hey, knock yourself out.  "Hey, boy, I think I am going to throw this t-shirt in the donation bag. Unless you want it. For the memories." This t-shirt was given to me one night during the post-Haiti transition. He had come back and decided that he had made a big mistake and wanted to re-kindle the relationship. That night, I was talking on the phone to my new little man friend, boy showed up at the door, a little tipsy, eyes all droopy and watery.  "I tried to call, but your line was busy." He holds his hands at the side. There is a bag in his hands. I figure he is from one of his little sadness shopping sprees. "That's because I was on the phone." "Yeah, I figured that. But I wanted to see you." Silence. "Here I am. Have you been drinking?" "Just a little bit. Three. Four. Basses. Hey. I brought you a gift." He had just been to a hockey game with one of our "professors" - will not explain quotes at this time - in an effort to compartmentalize, his favorite hobby. He pulls a t-shirt out of a bag from Philips Arena. It reads, "Hockey love. Can you feel it?" There is a heart on it. It made him think of me. Because he hearts me. He thinks it's cute. I think he's drunk. So I look at it and thank him for the gift. I spy the size - large - on the tag.  "Large? Did you mean to get large?" "Well, the small one seemed waaaaaaay too small." At this point, I explain the concept of the baby tee to him. He seems puzzled at first but soon catches on. He hangs his head because he is disappointed. He had no way of knowing. I tell him to cheer up, I really like it, it's cute. Blah blah. Maybe it will shrink in the machine.  As he sees me tossing all those thoughtful gifts into the trash, he pretends not to care and tells me: "If that's what you need to do as part of the process..." I am not sure what process he's talking about, but I guess he thinks that I am discarding items because of their sentimental value. Honestly, I just don't want a lot of junk when I move - I am keeping photos from our time together and other little things that matter. And don't take up space.  The second day of baby's big clean-up had me at his house at 11. He was on the roof - you know, doing all those "urgent" things instead of prioritizing and cleaning up for his mother's arrival - so I waved and went inside. The second I've begun plowing through my stuff, he calls my cell phone:  "So, what happened? You weren't going to say hello to me?" "I thought that's what the wave was..." "Oh, I thought you were mad at me."  What? "No, just wanted to start on my shit." "Anyway, can you come out and bring me a bucket of water? No. Just pass me the hose."  The day is a long one, where we both feel overwhelmed by our stuff and getting it organized. I have less stuff than he, so he is really beginning to get edgy about getting things done for mom's visit. This day, atlblingbling is getting my bed, and we have to do some back and forth with that. Boy goes to buy a replacement bed but arrives at the store too late - presumably because of me. He calls me when I am heading back to his house: "When will you be back? I am in a really bad mood. And I was wondering when you'll be out of here." "What are you talking about? I'm on my way. I just had to help unload the bed, got a drink... I really don't like your attitude. Could you fucking relax?" "Well, ok. But you had better hurry up. It's been 15 minutes."  I get there, annoyed that he's being snitty. What did he expect? I am moving away for a while and have to make sure that I've accounted for all my stuff...  So, I get there, start stacking things back into place. He is calling my name from the lower level of the house. I ignore him. I don't have time to talk. I have to get out. He runs up: "I'm sorry. You know I'm really stressed. I am not angry with you but about the fact that I needed to get that bed because I won't have time to do it during the week, and my mom is coming and the place is a mess and..." "Ok. Whatever."  We both start our cleaning. I suggest that we go out for drinks or food or whatever. It's a friendly gesture. I do not expect him to agree. He does, but within half an hour, he wants just drinks, and then 15 minutes later it's wine and bread in the house. Which is ok, because he is wearing me out with his little stressed-out routine...  We do finally sit down at the table and have this fabulous conversation about some other things we found when I was cleaning out my stuff. Things are getting cozy, he even seems - dare i say it? - happy until...  Princess calls. I was interested. I wanted to see what a boy-princess interaction might look like. It was not pretty. Since he is trying to avoid her. His side of the conversation went something like this: "I'm doing ok. Just tired." "No, I told you, I'm tired." "Well, getting some stuff done around the house." "Mhm." "Should be wrapping up soon." "Nothing's wrong. I'm fine!" "Some time this week. And my mother is coming this weekend." "I told you, I'm doing all right. I'm just stressed and tired." "Nothing's wrong. I'm just doing my work." "Yes, I'll eat." "No, I'm going to bed early tonight." "How many times do I have to tell you that I'm just stressed and tired?" And so on for about 15 minutes...  When he gets off the phone, he is no longer happy. I make a friendly statement about how you just need to tell people - including me, if need be - to just fuck off. If you don't want to talk, if you don't want to deal with a person because s/he is causing stress, tell 'em to go. He is all foul-faced and upset...  I grab my bags and prepare to go... I do not want to deal with sourpus and he does not want to deal with me. I walk out the door and he says, "You can't just leave like this." What the fuck is he talking about now?  "You can't leave me without giving me a hug..." Bah. Right. When is he going to get out of this mess?

      RICK JAMES, MR PUNK FUNK, DIES. So, by now, the news of  urlLink Rick James ' death is out there. It's so strange. I was actually shocked, though I am sure that his drug history - though he is clean now - took its toll on his body. He's younger than my parents. I think they were going to make some sort of biographical film about him and it would have been interesting to see how his music evolved, how wholesome Motown interacted with the superfreak. For a long time, I actually thought he was Canadian (it was in some movie about Canadians that led me to believe this), but he is actually from Buffalo, NY and fled to Toronto when he went AWOL from the military. He was in a group with Neil Young, y'all. And he's a nephew of Melvin, the deep-voiced Temptation (this explains that weird "Temptations sing!" line in "Super Freak", I think. I always wondered why they signed up to sing the "ooooooooooooooo").  A bit of disturbing information about Sir Rick (can one be knighted posthumously?) from his biographical sketch on his website:   And after bedding by his count "thousands" of women, James,  50, has settled down with dancer Tanya Hijazi, 27 (whom he married in December  1997 after an 11-year relationship), and their 5-year-old son, Tazman. "I'm too  old to do crazy things anymore," says James. "Before, I'd just smoke dope and  have sex. I never knew if it was day or night. Now I go to bed at 11 and get up  at 7. I don't have aluminum foil on my windows anymore."    Did anyone do the math on this "dancer" he was dating?  Talking about Rick reminds me of my friend, Miriam.We pretended that we were Teena Marie and Rick James and belted out their most beloved duet, "Fire and Desire".  We always brought down the classroom with our "You were as cold as iiiiiiiiiice..."  Ho-hum. Going out tonight to do whatever. I hope I get enough sleep to face boy tomorrow. I want to organize my shite so that I can get out of that place. As much as I care about the guy, I really am tired of have to deal with wishywashiness. I hope someone will do a better job with it than I have for the past few years.

       PSYCHO EX GIRLFRIEND GOES APE SHIT . It's like we have never fucking broken up.   Ok. If you haven't figured it out yet, I am psycho ex-girlfriend. And the name is an overstatement. Today. As is the ape shit part. But for me, the degree of "ape shit" that I explored this morning is noteworthy. I called to apologize to boy for being annoyed with him about a phone conversation. I was only a little annoyed, but he needs reassurance, given his delicate state.   Anyway, after we talked a bit on the phone last night, he got all: "I'm tired. I can't talk. My ear hurts...You know how I hate talking on the phone..." Or whatever he said. I usually tune him out and go into annoyed mode because I live 5 minutes from him, he claims that he wants to talk to and see me, but where is his ass? At home, calling me from his home phone. So, out of annoyance, I was like, "Isn't any of this important to you? Well, I am annoyed by this. You do this way too often..." Blah blah blah. It was from a script. I'm sure I've said it before.   This thing about phones, the fact that he hates talking on them - adds a little color to the fact that we were in a long-distance relationship off and on for the past couple of years. The first couple of years were cozy ones where we were inseparable - makes me cringe to think about how co-dependent we were. But, just the facts.   So, he's all - "we can talk this weekend when you get your stuff. And tell atlblingbling that she needs to get the bed because I need to go buy a new one this weekend. I lost her number." I say, "I'll do that. But. Um. Well, funny thing, that... I actually don't know when I'm going to leave EXACTLY..."   "Well, you'd better let me know soon. Because, you know, I have things to do." Like princess? Or me, maybe, in your mind?   "Oh, well, I'm still waiting for this other person. But I won't leave you hanging. I'll give you advance notice."   "That's not good enough. You need to call me and let me know. I need to buy a bed because my mother is coming next weekend." Wow. I should stay til next weekend. Then I get to run into therapist mom, let her tell me how great I look. I would smirk as I read her mind: How could my son have gotten this premium POA? And what happened that made this relationship end? Oh, yes, that's right. He fears rejection and commitment and doesn't know what to do when someone as good as this comes along.   Delusions of grandeur, everybody. Delusions of grandeur. A girl's gotta have 'em. He broke up with me because I am moving, he hates talking on the phone and he is a sad motherfucker. He spends $1,000 on an antique map ("it's an investment, baby..."), and has the nerve to be like - "I'm not made of money. You need to pay me such and such..." That's how sad he is.   Anyway, I emerge from the daydream to hear him saying, "Look, this is my time. You have to make a decision. I'm not going to be waiting around for you to make some decision. I need to have this stuff done this weekend, so I can get organized for the visit."   Ding ding ding. Does anyone else see an opportunity for me to chime in with past hurts?   "Ok. Let's get something straight. How well do you know me? Since when have I ever said that I would do something as important as this and flaked?"   "Never, I guess."   "Right. So where do you get off telling me to hurry and make a decision because you can't wait? How many years did we date? How many of those years did I put up with you, not making a decision and making me wait for some important revelation?"   "Well, that's only been recently..."  "Recently? Oh, don't get me started on that miserable Christmas and New Year's in Sierra Leone, where you said you'd call, but you didn't. I waited for your ass. And certainly don't get me started on those antique engagement rings... But those things are in the past. I don't care anymore. I just hope I'm making my point. I'll give you enough notice about picking up my stuff, so please don't project your flakiness on to me."   Silence.   "Ok. I have to get ready for work now."   "Ok, bye."   No, there wasn't a juicier ending, with phones slamming, or tears or any of that other drama that he's *obviously* trying to avoid by having a relationship with a co-worker and having emotional entanglements with his ex. But that's how it ended. Ok. Ok. Bye.

      A LITTLE POLITICAL.  For some reason - perhaps it was the stint in Sierra Leone (though I actually had CNN for the many months I was *there*) - I have not been able to get really excited about the upcoming presidential election. Certainly, I can think of nothing better than a sound defeat of GWB, but... I'm just not *feeling* Kerry and Edwards quite yet.  Anyone who knows me knows that my current political ennui is strange, because my first major political debate was in the second grade. I was standing in the lunch line, contemplating a second "white milk"  when the boy whose last name came before mine turned back to me and asked, "So, who are you voting for in the election?" As if 7 year-olds can vote. Pshaw. I answered defiantly, "Mondale, of course. My daddy went to DC to work for Carter, so of course, Fritz Mondale. What about you?"  "Are you crazy? Reagan."  It was my first interaction with a Republican, and I. Was. Aghast.  I wanted to know WHY someone would even consider such a thing, voting for Reagan. I lived in my little comfy, middle-class black neighborhood, surrounded by doctors, teachers, nurses, social workers - none of them clued me in, not a single one of them let me know that people would actually *vote* for Reagan. He was an actor for goodness sakes. On a side note, I did not know that he was governor of California, didn't realize that he had already served a term as president, but I certainly knew that whatever he did in the past was not so good. Besides, I saw him in that chimp movie on TBS and thought he was too silly to be president. But anyway, I digress...  I went home and asked my brother, "Can you believe that there's a boy in my class - he's voting for Reagan?"  My brother, J, in his astute wise new teenage way, rubbed his peach-fuzzed chin and replied, "Well, I think that people just vote for someone who seems popular. He seems like he's just one of the guys..."  Boy, J does not know how fucking prescient his little Buddha moment was. Have we, as Americans, moved forward since 1984?  So, the reason I started this ramble is because I saw this  urlLink website  on  urlLink ms. grits ' blog. You do the little quiz and it tells you which candidates best match your preferences on certain issues. I am most compatible ideologically (?) with Kucinich (71%) and Kerry (68%).

      THANKS to all (4) of you who voted. Atlblingbling and I voted; we just wonder who the other two people are. Anyway, I did see boy last night, despite his flakiness about dinner. I think the dinner would have been too much for him. Reminders of old times, a very pissed-off princess (who is soon to be no more - someone comes to senses), desires for "the good stuff", crying crying and more crying, etc.  *ASIDE* Okay. I had this conversation with BIB while atlblingbling was in the shower. I told him how the princess hates me because she overheard me dissin' her when i was talking to boy on the phone (I mentioned that she was ridiculous for putting up with his baggage, especially when he basically put that shit - roller duffel, suit bag and all- right in the middle of her living room. I know it's a bad metaphor but hang with me folks...it's been a rough couple of months.)   I only remembered yesterday that boy never said, "Look, Wild Honey, that's my girlfriend you're talking about. Please refrain from saying such things..." Not that he would phrase it like that, but you know what I mean. He just sat there silently and then responded with, "Sounds like you're hurt. Please, just calm down. I don't want either of us to regret what we're saying..." On other occasions - when I referred to her as wildhoney lite - he would just laugh and say, "That's a funny name. Who came up with that one? Peter?" BIB thinks he's not serious. I agree. But I also know what that's like. Sometimes, you just gotta drown your sorrows in a rebound person. ***  Anyway, I had a book that I thought he'd like to read. I wanted to drop it by before bedtime. So I called him after drink (this is key) and before dinner with Atlblingbling and BIB.   I told him that if the lights were off, I would just come by the next day to drop off a book/gift. He agreed that he needed reading material for Angola because when he's not avoiding landmines (!) and chumming it up with his sexist colleagues(remnants of a portuguese colonial past?), he has lots of down time. It doesn't surprise me actually, because he used to be bouncing off the walls with happiness, and had trouble immediately expressing himself in English (his native language, he's from Massachusetts) when I called him there: "Phone sex? Phone sex?"   So, the porch light was on. All others were off. I hit the doorbell, unsure if some obnoxious theme song would be playing.(You never know with this guy, really). He came downstairs in the t-shirt/boxer shorts combination, and we stood together in the requisite pile of junk in his living room. As he rubs sleep out of his eyes - or pretends to - I look around the house.   Since my last time in the house, he's put in recessed lights, has absorbed some of my wood carvings into his little African statue collection, has purchased more tables on which to house more junk...   We talk for some time and keep it clean. We have a lot of physical contact in the form of goodbyes. I acknowledge the good job I did in picking curtains, painting walls, contributing to his junk... I also notice that despite all these touches of mine, I don't *exist* in the house anymore. There's no more of me. And I say so. Boy says,  "A bit of you will always be here in the house."  I shake my head, like I am not so sure. I see his eyes well up with tears and I say,  "Aw, how sweet... now, are you going to take off your shorts, or shall I?"  But we both know better.  That night, after this long goodbye, I went home and watched Six Feet Under [link] on DVD.

       NO MORE DRAMA . I am happy today. "What the fuck?" anyone who knows me well might ask. I am tired, I am working on a few hours of sleep, but I am deliriously happy. Part of it is because I got the first decent bit of emotional honesty (breakthrough of the decade, ladies and gents) from boy and the other part is that I had a restful - albeit short - sleep. I hope that sentence made sense. Because I just cannot edit this afternoon.   Karaoke News . No, dearies, I did not sing "Eye of the Tiger" last night. But I did sing a killer " urlLink Jessie's Girl ". It killed (perhaps I am overstating this, for I was in a room full of strippers/indie sophisticates) for the following reason: I know a lot - maybe too much -  urlLink about Rick Springfield  and inserted tidbits about SoapOperaHeartthrob MD during the gratuitous guitar solos.  Here are some of the bits:  1. His name is really Richard Springthorpe. Is Springthorpe not sexy enough for you Hollywood? Huh? 2. He is Australian (sorry, Joanne!) 3. He was on  urlLink General Hospital . Sizzle. Ouch, so hot. 4. He broke his arm on tour (yes, he is  urlLink ON TOUR ). The fifty-something imagined himself a young rockstar and fell off his little rockstar harness.  Later note:  I've just found out that although charges were dropped due to insufficient evidence, RS was arrested for  urlLink spousal abuse  a few years ago. That just unsexies him, doesn't it?

       I AM JUST FULL ... of things to say today. I've not been writing about music, which is weird, because my whole life is dominated by the songs I know, the songs I can play, songs I wished I had written, songs that I wish I could play. Maybe I've been blocking all this out because my CDs and guitars are holed away in boy's house. Anyway, as poorly as I play, I do hope to start a band (indie?country? indie-country? - not much of this in Cambridge/Boston, I'm sure) in the fall. Anyway, this song keeps bouncin' 'round my head for various reasons. I saw it in a karaoke book a few weeks ago and was thinking, "This would be a really hard song to sing...Buckley's voice is all over the place in this one..." I can't even imagine anyone touching this one at The Local.  Last Goodbye (J. Buckley)  This is our last goodbye   I hate to feel the love between us die   But it's over   Just hear this and then I'll go :   you gave me more to live for,   more than you'll ever know.    This is our last embrace,   must I dream and always see your face   Why can't we overcome this wall   Baby, maybe it is just because I didn't know you at all.    Kiss me, please,   Kiss me   But kiss me out of desire, babe, and not consolation   You know,   it makes me so angry 'cause I know that in time   I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye.    Did you say "no, this can't happen to me,"   and did you rush to the phone to call?   Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind saying,    "maybe... you didn't know him at all."    Well, the bells out in the church tower chime   Burning clues into this heart of mine   Thinking so hard on her soft eyes and the memory    Of her sighs that, "it's over... it's over..."

       HURT, CONFUSED, PISSED. I AM ALL THESE THINGS.  All right. So I've talked to the boy to let him know that there are some things in my refrigerator that he might want to use for tomorrow's dinner. In usual boy fashion, he has not decided what he wants to cook and he also sounded like he might back out of the engagement. I am sure that I mentioned that I was hoping that this would be our opportunity to clear things up, have a bit of resolution/closure. Just to have one last private meeting before I leave. But, as I was saying earlier, I think he might flake. Here's the  urlLink poll .

       THE LAST KNOWN SURVIVOR . I might be doing karaoke tonight at my favorite OLD  urlLink strip club . Or maybe I wasn't invited. I can't seem to remember these things anymore. Remind me to never take  urlLink mefloquine  again. Or those other drugs that degrade memory and make one psychotic.  atlblingbling caved to her BIB again. She is so like me. Not only do our "ex's" have the same first name, they have the same fucking neuroses. And we continue to feel some sadness when they express their sadness.  I guess I can only end with this line from  urlLink Bad(der) Santa . "Why don't you just shit in one hand and wish in the other? See which one fills up first." Not sure what it means on a literal level, but I think the philosophy is this: Shit is more tangible?

      A WALK TO REMEMBER  This weekend I was supposed to go to a  urlLink meeting . However, I woke on Saturday morning with menstrual cramps from hell, an upset stomach from who knows where and an overwhelming feeling of nausea.  I slept into the early afternoon, and felt better after stuffing my face with painkillers.  As I awoke from the usual boy dream, I decided that I needed to give him his shit back.  Oh, lord, what was I thinking?  I caught  urlLink MARTA  to a station that I was *certain* was within close walking distance to his house. Little, little did I know...  An hour and a half later, I was dehydrated, hungry, crampy, bleeding, sore. I left a message with atlblingbling, depressed as hell about the fact that I was in the middle of nowhere, with no chance of walking my ass all the way back to the station. I thought I remembered the short-cut - I was just too tired.  I went to the  urlLink House of God  Church, certain that I looked pitiful enough to elicit some of the good ol' religion and hospitality. They gave me water and offered me food. Fearing a proselytizing moment, I just accepted the water and stood outside.   A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM  Atlblingbling took care of me. I am grateful. We stopped at  urlLink CVS  - started in Woonsocket, RI, home of mommy's favorite little Brownie - visited the "feminine care" aisle and stocked up on heating implements. You cannot beat 8 hours of continuous *heat* in your underwear, now can you?  Stuffed my face with more painkillers, went to the  urlLink Highlands  and stared at lots of fake sparklesparkle. And started to have more cramps.  These were damped by alcohol - no sermons please - and then followed up with tears of depression.1) Am I crazy? 2) Why did I walk so far? 3) Am I trying to abuse myself?  Answers: 1) Of course I am not crazy, just maybe a little spontaneous. 2) It was good exercise, that five-mile walk in the sun. 3) See answer #2. No pain, no gain.  Night ended with me doing a  urlLink condom demonstration  with an oyster sauce bottle and picking on the boy and how he is "so over me".    THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE  Why do I love the boy so much? Maybe because he is desperately clinging to those little heartstrings. He called and woke me from my Sunday slumber with a proposition. He fully introduced himself and used my full first name. As if I had forgotten who he was...  He wanted to cook for me on Wednesday. He called to whine about that goddammed bed (it's mine - why was there discussion?) He will not attend a going away party because he thinks that everyone who would be there would hate him. (Always worrying about who hates his ass instead of thinking about the fact that he might not see *my* ass again).  I am sure the meal will be good. He will talk, I will listen.  I will eat. He will watch.  I can practically see his heart beating every time that I see him. He is always so nervous.
