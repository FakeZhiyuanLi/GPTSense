      The temperature at which book paper catches fire and burns...  Rather mesmerizing book I'm reading now, written in the 1950's and still relevant even today. Before reading it, I didn't realize it was a utopia kind of story and while I've read 1984 and Brave New World, this book just didn't come to mind. After some producer told he got the title for his movie of this book.. Didn't see that movie (which is of course about Bush and Iraq), but I bought this book though :)  It's about a future where books are forbidden and burnt if discovered in someone's house. People are given games and things to do or watch to keep from thinking for themselves, TV is a kind of wall to wall surround vision virtual reality show and the people in it are your family. Books and knowledge do not fit in.  Ah yes, the controversy of knowledge and that of man. Knowledge is good and knowledge is bad. Knowledge can be man's enlightenment and man's downfall. No, that's not entirely true... it WILL be our downfall. Knowledge will eventually clean the earth of man, because it is ungoverned, almost unrestricted and so easily abused. Yet it's in our nature to seek knowledge, thus creating our own self destruction. Combined with the individuality/community controversy, it makes us rather weird creatures, doesn't it?

      I recently started reading the Rule of Four by Ian Caldwell and Dustin Thomason, I'm somewhere in the middle, and it just starts to get interesting. Well, that's not true, it's been interesting from the start, but just not that good.  Now I'm not a native English speaker but I have very little difficulty in reading English books. The use of words in this book is very bah humbug though and it gets in the way of reading smoothly. The fact is, you don't have to use posh words to write nicely, it's not the words that make up the story, it's the way they're used and the flow of it. If you overly intentionally use difficult words or phrases just to sound interesting, it's a sign of insecurity of the author.  Anyway, so far it's becoming more and more interesting even though the tale is told using flashbacks in all the wrong places. I especially hate flashbacks, they're always used wrong and interrupt (the pace of) the story. I've read the Da Vinci code and it's no comparison. The Da Vinci code was a nice book too - although flagrantly a blueprint copy of Dan Brown's first book Angels & Demons - but it's obviously more commercially written, fast paced, high on the action and the usual storybook babe. One thing though, The Angels & Demons - Da Vinci Code kind of storytelling is (IMO) quite original and makes The Rule of Four just another copycat kind of book.  People just don't seem to be very original these days. I've sought long for books like LOTR, Dune (1st one), The Stand, Lost World etc, each a classic in it's own kind, but it's just frustrating to see books getting duped, even sometimes by their very own authors.
