      Last night I was able to spend some time with a good friend. We got pedicures, had dinner, and walked around the mall for a little while. It was GREAT to get to spend time with Leana...she knows me so well! Today I will be helping Pammie make Cora's baby announcements. Carrie will be stopping by to see baby Cora and show us her RING! Now that I think of it, I don't have anything BIG to show my friends...no ring...and definitely no baby! Maybe I should bring the new family dog Monty...

      Today was my first official day of  SUMMER VACATION ! I slept until 9:45, did a little shopping at some local scrapbook stores ( urlLink Archivers  and  urlLink The Crop Stop ), went to  urlLink Ulta  to restock beauty supplies, visited Julie, Sarah, and Baby Alex, and worked on grad school stuff (blah). Each season I get a some new makeup and it is amazing how great a new nail polish can make you (and your toes) feel! I am looking forward to spending time with friends and family, scrapbooking, and going to the beach on the 4th of July. Yeah for summer time!

      Martha and I were preparing the 5th grade files for middle school when Cathy from the front office comes in to ask us a few questions. As Martha was writing a note Cathy noticed the pen she was using. She asked Martha where she got the pen. I told her that it was mine and I got it from a parent. At this point, Cathy had a puzzled look on her face. I explained that the parent works for a medical lab and she sends me pens, post-its, etc... I said, "I wouldn't use the supplies if it had something like Viagra written on it." Cathy then informed me that Lavitra (which was what was written on the pen) is another type of Viagra! We were all laughing and wondering if the parent was trying to tell me something. What makes it even funnier is that I have more than one of those "Lavitra" pens and I had been using them at parent meetings! I just hope none of the parents realized what was written on that pen!

      I am in  baby heaven ! Two of my best friends had babies this week. Pammie had a little girl (Cora Ann) on Tuesday and Julie had her second child (Alexander Neil) on Thursday. Both moms and babies are doing well. The babies are soooo adorable. And I'm not just saying that because their my friend's babies, they really are  super  cute!

      As I was leaving school today the A.P. stopped to tell me that one of my students was suspended for  biting  another student during lunch. The sad part is the student is in 4th grade! I can't wait to hear all the details tomorrow. Thank God there are only 3 more days left!

      Food fights are inevitable at the end of the school year. Rumor has it that many of the 5th graders at my school are planning a food fight as their 5th grade prank. I thought 12th graders were the only ones who pulled end of the year pranks? Anyways, I hope there will not be any bananas involved. The principal at my school can't even look at a banana without becoming nauseated and passing out...no joke. The smell, sight, or even talk of bananas is FORBIDDEN in the presence of our Principal. Just in case you were wondering, the official name of banana fear is Bananaphobia. A complete list of phobias can be found by clicking  urlLink here .

      Now I know why I really like this blogger thing. It's not because it serves as a great procrastination tool (as previously stated), it's because it requires no reflective statements on crap that does not improve my teaching ability, no citations on works by some random person who has probably never taught a day in their life, no APA formatting, etc...   Basically a blog could also be known as a place to post your bitch sessions for the world to read (see previous paragraph). Or a place to share your most embarrassing moments (like the time when I wet the bed...and I wasn't the only adult in the bed) so others can make fun of you for eternity. Or a place to share what's going on in your life to friends you don't talk to often but wish you did. Or...okay, so the possibilities are endless.   Did I mention I am soooooo burned out with grad school?

      I  love  this Blogging thing! It is a great procrastination tool. I have grad school papers due, I.E.P.'s to write for my graduating 5th graders, and lesson plans to make for the last week of school. I am sooooo jealous of a friend who has just finished grad school. Oh how I wish that was me! Congratulations Susan:)

      As an elementary school teacher I have an pretty entertaining job. Whether it's my students making me laugh or a colleague's student, my days are rarely dull. The following story took place a few weeks ago...  The special education teacher, Miss A, was in the middle of instructing a small math group when another teacher, Miss B, came to her classroom door.   Miss B: "I think one of your students needs help in the boys bathroom. I kept hearing a little voice saying help me...Help me."  Miss A thought that the student might need soap or paper towels. At the very worst she thought he might need help with a stuck zipper.  Miss A approached the doorway of the boys bathroom and called to her student, "Nick....Are you o.k.?"  Nick: "Nooooo."  Miss A: "What's wrong?"  Nick: "It's stuck. My poo poo is stuck!"  Miss A: (While trying not to snicker) "Did you try to push really hard?"  Nick: "I tried....but it's still stuck."  At this point Nick begins to cry.  Miss A: "Does it hurt?"  Nick: "No....I just want to hurry up so I can get to the Lego's center first!"  Miss A decided to go to the school nurse for advice. She told Nick to keep pushing while she was gone. Miss A was about in tears while she tried to explain the predicament her student was in. The nurse informed Miss A that there was not much she could do but instruct the student to try to wipe it away.  While she was gone a few teachers had heard cries of help from the bathroom and were trying to figure out what was going on. Miss A returned and told the teachers she was handling the "problem".  Miss A: "Nick.....How's it going?"  Nick: "Not good.....It's still stuck....It's just hanging there!"  Now, if you knew this child you would know that he was not saying these things to be goofy or obnoxious. He was  truly  distressed that he was stuck in the bathroom wasting his hard earned center time on some poo poo that wouldn't come out.  To make an already long story short...Miss A was able to talk Nick through the poo poo problem. He was able to successfully "wipe it away" and return to his beloved Lego's center.  This might have been one of those "you just had to be there" kind of stories but I thought someone would find humor in this poor kids crisis.

      It's Friday night/Saturday morning and I am tired but can't sleep. My neck has been killing me from physical therapy this week. So I decided to get up and write about my exciting Friday night instead of tossing and turning in bed.   Seeing that most of my friends are married now and starting families, Friday nights aren't what they used to be! My neighbor friend has two kids, 1 1/2 and 8 years old. Her 12 year old niece is also staying with her for the summer. At 4pm (b/c it's not too crowded at 4pm) we took them to  urlLink Chuck E. Cheese's . I used to  LOVE  that place when I was a kid! The kids had a really good time and my friend and I got a chance to catch up on the latest neighborhood gossip (which, by the way, can be pretty pathetic).  Tonights Chuck E. Cheese's experience was not nearly as cool as I remember it in the early 1980's. Here are some of my thoughts, observations, and results of a Yahoo "Chuck E. Cheese" search (lame, I know).  1. It seemed a whole lot bigger when I was a kid.  2. There was no  BALL PIT :(  What the heck is the 2004 Chuck E. Cheese thinking!  3. Chuck E. Cheese (the mouse himself) did not seem as excited as I remember him...maybe it's old age.  4. There is a big indoor tunnel maze like the ones at McDonalds or Burger King. If I wanted to play in one of these plastic tube thingys I could do it for free at one of the previously mentioned fast food places.  5. The prizes were cheap, unless you had like a  gazillion  tickets. I guess that is one thing that has remained the same.  6. They still had Skee Ball, Hungry Hippo's game, and the Whack-A-Mole game - yeah!  7. Here is an  urlLink article  of one Chuck E. Cheese that had the police called 40 times in one year!  8. The first Chuck E. Cheese (1977) was in San Jose, California. Click this  urlLink link  to see the original brochure and menu. Take notice of the prices!  After my fun-filled night at Chuck E. Cheese's, I came home and worked on a scrapbook page, did a facial mask, read some of my Sting book, and talked to Justin on the phone. NOW I will try to go to sleep...

      Well, I will be finished with my 9th grad school class this week! I will be starting my 10th and final class next week - no break...as usual. I really need to be working on my portfolio which is due August 31st. I can't graduate until it is approved - ahhh!   I really have nothing else to report. I am keeping busy with scrapbooking, seeing friends, going to the gym, and procrastinating on writing grad school papers. I will be posting some of my favorite scrapbook pages as soon as I can find a scanner that will scan 12x12 pages. I am going to try Kinko's tomorrow. Yes, that sounds much better than writing a paper or working on my portfolio!

      I met Justin at Phipps Plaza tonight. We went to see the movie "Dodgeball". It was really funny but the plot was stupid. It's a good movie to see if you feel like laughing and not thinking. After the movie we went to Justin's favorite place,  urlLink Johnny Rockets . Not my favorite place but there were not many choices at 10pm on a Sunday night. We had a nice time together...too short as usual. Now I need to be working on grad school stuff but I just can't seem to get motivated..

      I just returned from a quick trip to the beach with my friend Nikki. Each year Nikki, Leana, and I go to the beach but this year Leana had to stay home for graduate classes. This was the 3rd year of our annual beach trip. The first year we stayed in  urlLink Seagrove Beach , the 2nd year we stayed at a cute cabin in  urlLink Seaside Beach , and this year we stayed at  urlLink The Inn at Gulf Place  in  urlLink Santa Rosa Beach . We had a great time...it was very relaxing.   We went to some of our ususal stops:  urlLink Zoo Gallery ,  urlLink Red Bar , and  urlLink Fudpuckers .  A few new places we checked out were:  urlLink Miss Lucille's Gossip Parlor  and  urlLink The Artists of Gulf Place .  So now I am back home to write papers for grad school...let the fun begin!

      I went to play at the monthly  urlLink Bunco  game tonight and I won $10! I know that seems trival but I  NEVER  win anything at Bunco.   Otherwise today was kinda of a blah day. I did paperwork, set up my first physical therapy appointment, read, went to the gym, and worked on some grad school stuff. I wish I had something more exciting to report...like an engagement ring. Now that would be exciting!

      Ok, so I went to the Emory Spine Center. They diagnosed me with Spondylolsis...I don't really know what this is. I do know that it has to do with my neck/shoulder area. I have to go to physical therapy twice a week for a month. The physical therapy referral form noted that I would be doing the following therapeutic exercises: stabilization, strengthening, stretching, and soft tissue mobilization...sounds interesting.  Tonight I went to one of my favorite places,  urlLink Barnes and Noble . I  LOVE  to read and listen to music. It’s kinda weird and maybe a little freaky but I get the best feeling when I am in the store. I can’t totally explain it. I feel relaxed, smart, motivated, and excited. I also feel a little overwhelmed because there are so many things that I find myself wanting to read!   In the music section they have this new listening center. You can listen to the top selling 100 CD’s. You are able to listen to the whole CD! I heard of a relatively new artist,  urlLink Jem . It’s not the Jem from the  urlLink Jem and the Holograms  cartoon many of you may remember. This Jem is from Wales and her debut CD is “truly outrageous”! All kidding aside, the CD is really good. This quote regarding Jem’s music was taken from her  urlLink website , “a fresh and distinctive new sound. Jem's music is a combination of bright melodies, soul-searching lyrics and diverse rhythms that grab you from the first listen. Her seemingly innocent lyrics contain those closely observed details that are as much about optimism as they are about discovery.”  I also purchased two new books:  urlLink Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris  and  urlLink Little Bitty Lies by Mary Kay Andrews . I can’t wait to read them…by the pool…if Atlanta ever has another sunny day…

      Today I feel very sad. I had to cancel my trip to Europe. Basically I have been sick for a while (stomach aches) and the doctors aren't sure exactly what's wrong. I was advised not to take the trip because I am not able to eat normally right now. They have me on ulcer medication. While I was in the process of trying to find out what is wrong with my stomach, the doctor's found something wrong with my spine! So I have been referred to the  urlLink Emory Spine Center .   My friends are pretty upset about me not going. My feelings are hurt. It's not like I want to possibly lose $1600 deposit. I have to file a claim with the travel insurance company. My feelings are hurt because my friends seemed more concerned about the trip than me. What would you have done? Seeing that I may have gall crystals (they can turn to gall stones and block a bile duct), which are not seen on all the tests I had done, I would hate to have a major problem in another country. Not to mention that I can only eat a few things right now and I am in almost constant pain. So that's the story about me not going to Europe.   Today I tried to make myself feel better by using a  urlLink Spa Sydell  gift certificate from a former student. I went with my friend Nikki to get a facial. I really wanted a full body massage but seeing that I have to go to the spine doctor on Tuesday I thought I better just leave my back alone. The facial was nice until the lady got out the big magnifying mirror and proceeded to point out the many tiny brown spots - sun damage! These are spots I had never noticed before but now that's all I see when I look at my face - ugh! I thought those spots were freckles...what a let down.   As I was on my way home from my "facial/let me give you some bad news about your face", I stopped at the grocery store and a card store. Keep in mind I was in the Gwinnett Place Mall area which has a large Hispanic population. As I was looking for a card a lady came up to me and said, "Â¿Usted habla espaÃ±ol?". I thought it was kind of funny that she thought I might speak Spanish but thought nothing else of it. Next I go to the grocery store and as I am leaving the Self Check-Out lane  ANOTHER  lady stops me. She appeared to be having trouble with the machine and she asked me if I spoke Spanish! I nicely told her no and left the store. I wondered what the hell I was wearing that made people think that I might speak Spanish. I could not believe this happened twice in one day! I have had people ask me if I am Hispanic, Asian, etc... but not in a long time. Anyways, I had to share that...the whole experience was a little "Twilight Zoneish".

       Last night I was reading Sting's book   urlLink   Broken Music     and was able to relate to the following passage.      "I will become so swept up in these journeys of discovery that I will continue to read and read, long after the academic need has passed. There are no books in my house apart from a Bible and some equally unfathomable engineering texts from my father's apprenticeship, but soon books will become for me an acquisitive passion filling up rooms and rooms with their dusty and inert bodies. Like my grandmother, I will never throw a book away, storing dog-eared paperbacks from school or college, year after year, stacked like hunting trophies on makeshift shelves in my room. For to sit in a room full of books, and remember the stories they told you, and to know precisely where each one is located and what was happening in your life at that time or where you were when you first read it is the languid and distilled pleasure of the connoisseur."   I love, love, love this passage! I had never been able to express my love of books as well as Sting has. It's true! I can think of a book I read and remember what was going on in my life at that time. Like&nbsp;Sting, &nbsp;I too love being surrounded by books, see&nbsp;June 9, 2004&nbsp;  urlLink  posting   .&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I am off to finish reading  Broken Music .

       Today was Cora's Baptism. She looked so cute in her little white gown! I am Cora's godmother and Pam's dad is the godfather. Mass was interesting......a lot of&nbsp;standing, sitting,&nbsp;and kneeling.     &nbsp;   Pam's mom cooked a ton of food, as&nbsp;usual. I don't think the woman knows how to cook "small". &nbsp;She was  still  trying to feed me as I was getting up from the table! Of course I did not leave empty handed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I took home a bag of homemade banana and apple muffins. Which, by the way, are&nbsp;very good. Pam made some of her famous fudge. I had a&nbsp;tiny bite and gave the rest to Brandon. It was good fudge, just&nbsp;way to rich for me.     &nbsp;   I gave Pam and Brandon the scrapbook I made for Cora. They thought it was really nice. I also gave Cora two books - a&nbsp;baby Bible and a children's book about God.     &nbsp;   Now I am back home and just finished working on grad school stuff. I am tired so I think I am going to head to bed and read a little of my Sting book......

       I am back from my vacation in Clearwater. I had a great time! I was able to spend a lot of time with my family and see friends that I had not seen in a long time. I tired to upload some pictures on my weblog but the quality looked really bad. I have never had a problem adding pictures with the Hello software but for some reason it was not uploading the pictures correctly. So you can click   urlLink  here    to see some of the pictures from Clearwater. I still have to develop pictures from the underwater camera...those should be really cute. I have also added a few more pictures from my beach trip with Nikki. Click   urlLink  here    to view those pictures.   Now it's back to grad school work. I have only 22 days left of summer vacation - ahhh! I plan to have  most  of my portfolio completed so I don't have to work on it at the beginning of the new school year. I will be finished with grad school on August 31st! I should have approval on my portfolio by the middle of September. Then it will be official - no more grad school!!!

       What is a rebuses? It is a puzzle where you decode a message consisting of pictures representing syllables and words. When I was in early elementary school I  loved  reading and making my own.   Today I am busy getting ready for my trip to Clearwater, Florida. I   urlLink       out Friday morning and I am so   urlLink      ! I am going to visit my family and some friends that I have not seen in 10 years. One of my friends has a   urlLink       that I have not seen yet. I hope we have   urlLink       weather because I want to spend lots of time at the   urlLink       getting a nice   urlLink      . Justin is going to take out the   urlLink       with my brother and sisters. I don't go that far out in the ocean because I am scared of   urlLink      ! We will watch fireworks on the 4th of July. I might take the kids to play minature   urlLink      . Well I gotta   urlLink       and go get a pedicure so my   urlLink      look pretty!

       27. Ahhh, I am that much closer to 30! Good thing I don't look or feel 27. I had a nice birthday. I got to see a lot of friends and Justin came up to take me to dinner. I also got some great gifts...clothes, stuff for my classroom, Barnes and Noble gift cards, scrapbooking gift cards, and a cute fleece blanket made by Mama Martha and Little Sis Caroline. Annette made a cookie cake that the group ate (all before lunch)!      Today was the last day of preplanning week. The kids come back to school on Monday. I won't start serving kids until Friday. The special education department has placement tests to give, schedules to make, and caseloads to assign Monday through Wednesday. On Thursday I get to teach the new IEP Online software to the department. It's an all day thing and I am  not  looking forward to it! I think I get paid a stipend for teaching the class...that would be nice.       I need to be working on grad school stuff but I think I am going to make journal labels for my reading classes instead. Maybe I will work on grad school stuff after making the labels...no, I think I need to write thank you cards.

       Today was the first official day for teachers to report to work. It was great to see everyone again. We have some new people on staff and they all seem really nice. I spent the majority of my day in meetings but did get to go out to lunch with 16 of my colleagues. My "mentee", Keri, is really excited about starting the school year. She had her first experience with the laminating machine today...no major problems, just a few pieces that will need to be relaminated! Keri is so sweet and is going to be a great addition to our team!       I am in the process of updating my links. I have added a new blog,   urlLink  All Kinds of Everything   . My friend  urlLink Natalie  introduced me to this blog. Natalie and I went to college with Mary. It's a great read so check it out!
