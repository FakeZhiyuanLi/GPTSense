      Ok, once a week I'm gonna do a shout out to a friend of mine. First person is...Dez!  Dez, You are an awesome person. I have learned so much stuff from you. You are a great friend, and it has rocked getting to know you better this summer, and becoming a better friend with you. You are my best friend who is a girl. You rock. From "Red Dot" to "CrzGrl" we've been through alot. I'm so happy that you are going to West Ranch with me, even though it sucks that you won't be going to school with Wes anymore. I can't wait to be in ASB and Video with you next year, and maybe even another class or two. Its fun to watch Family Guy, Whose Line, and Futurama with you (Spot the Star Trek Costumes!). And, well, you just an all around cool, awesome person. :)

      On a dare from Dez:    A GIRLY-GIRL. You dont have a lot of self-esteem and people are always bringing you down for being sad. What do they know, anyway? You feel like youre too mature for your age and are frustrated by the trend-followers who refuse to accept you because youre not like them.  Your virtues: Intelligence, understanding nature, modesty.  Your flaws: Lack of social life, inferiority complex, timidity..    You might like this game, but maybe it's not your thing.

      Saw Spiderman. It was OK. Liked most of it, but the ending sucked. What kind of bride does that to her husband? I mean, I've heard of ditching, but that was a little much. Anywho, my NexFlix movie should come tomorrow. Its been too long. I want it!

      Well, I'm off to go see Spiderman 2 with Tyler. Looks interesting, espically how the critics are split 50/50, with half of them loving it, and half of them hating it. I'll review when I get back. Also, look for some new features to pop up in the next few days.   Sean

       Ode To Spot    Felis Cattus,    is your taxonomic nomenclature,   an endothermic quadruped carnivorous by nature?    Your visual, olfactory and auditory senses   contribute to your hunting skills, and natural defenses.    I find myself intrigued by your subvocal oscillations,   a singular development of cat communications    that obviates your basic hedonistic predilection   for a rhythmic stroking of your fur, to demonstrate affection.    A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents;   you would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance.    And when not being utilized to aide in locomotion,   it often serves to illustrate the state of your emotion.    O Spot,   the complex levels of behaviour you display   connote a fairly well-developed cognitive array.    And though you are not sentient,   Spot,   and do not comprehend,   I nonetheless consider you a true and valued friend.   -Data    Sorry, just had to post that!

      Long time, no see!  Lets see, I went to the Dodger game, saw double homers and a grand slam, don't see that often..  I also started working at Kid Flix Camp, seems the newbies arn't that bad, better than what I've had to work with before. One more week, then I'm done with that. Ryan made me an awesome cape and mask, and made Brittany her God crown...that was pretty funny, though Kass didn't really like it, considering he was paying us for messing around ;-)  Oh, Steven dosn't know basic Star Trek triva...he deserves to be pelted with tricorders for the rest of eternity.
