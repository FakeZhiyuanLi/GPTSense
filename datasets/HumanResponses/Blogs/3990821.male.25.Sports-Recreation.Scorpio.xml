       Training today was a lot of fun.  Keith threw us around as he worked on the Gyokko Ryu Kihon Happo.  Ryan and I just practiced ukemi, rolling out of techniques and giving honest attacks.  My arm hurt, so did Ryan's, but we kept plugging away at it. Mr Maienza was as nice as always, and I wish him the best.  Afterward, Ryan and I convened at Cafe Ambrosia on Maynard in Ann Arbor.  We talked about what we saw, and what we felt were the lessons of the session.  We walked away with a few secrets, and some techniques for being better at what we do.  I felt as if I was being checked out by one of the barristas at the cafe.  I am always happy to receive attention from the opposite sex, but wasn't quite up to initiating conversation.   With servers in the food industry, there is always a certain level of allure and also a level of inattainability. Let's consider for a moment, that when women bring you what you want, and what you want in this case is food and beverage, you tend to feel a little bit of desire.  It is also true that in food service, servers try to look good.  Presentation is everything in food service.  And, this barrista was attractive, which creates a certain amount of confusion.  Average chances of hitting it off with a server/bartender/barrista?  Not much, because when does the job end (being friendly, chatty, and attractive) and the person begin (substance, personality, et cetera)?   Can you ever get to know that person in their work environment?  What does my dumb male mind consider?  Go back some other time and see if the same attention is there.  Will I?  Maybe when I can afford another cup of tea.  I see the hole, I've fallen in it before. I'll fall in it again.  I know one day I can avoid the whole thing.  All my best to the universe!

      Today, several of the nurses who come to the dojo to train gave Ryan the okay to train. The popping sound that occurred when I tweaked his arm was apparently nitrogen gas escaping.&nbsp; Who knew?&nbsp; Tomorrow we are going to be uke for our teacher and employer Keith.&nbsp; A fifth degree black belt is coming down to work with him.&nbsp; That means we get our asses kicked, but its always fun and exciting.&nbsp; Godan instructors are revered in the art as master instructors.  In other news, I am listening to Son Volt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cool.&nbsp; When Uncle Tupelo split up, the lead singer/songwriter started Son Volt, and all the other cats left to become Wilco. What makes me happiest about Uncle Tupelo is that a couple of albums of theirs were produced by Peter Buck of R.E.M. R.E.M. is my "favorite" group.&nbsp; The quotes are because they are just my longest standing standby band.&nbsp;&nbsp; You guess what that means.  Ciao!

      Today I could have really hurt Ryan in randori.&nbsp; I'm glad he has such an indomitable spirit, and that he knows when to launch himself forward&nbsp; ....  Also found out my little sister is having a baby boy.&nbsp; I have all nephews, zero nieces.&nbsp; When its my time to have kids, I know its gonna be girls... However, I have a&nbsp;while to wait.  By best to the world!

      "Without a proper frame of mind, continuous exposure to fighting techniques can lead to ruin instead of self-development" -Toshitsugu Takamatsu  Today I was reading through  Mind of the Ninja  by Kirtland C. Peterson.&nbsp; This book talks about the perceived nature of ninjutsu and the ninja traditions in popular culture, and explores what the cultural tradition is, what it means to study ninjutsu, and what the archetypes are for ninjutsu.  It fits that I am reading this work now, considering that we are shifting our focus behind the scenes at work to gear toward a model using Maslow's hierarchy of needs.&nbsp; Peterson's work seems a bit Jungian; that's not the parallel that I am seeing, but the shift to using better psychology to create a solid teaching methodology.  It's so important for me to keep my mind straight, so that I can help others in their quest. My challenge is that I haven't been in my happy place for a couple of weeks now.&nbsp; Part of it is just being crispy because of work and training, but there is some remnants of dis-ease since I quit the seminary.  Well, I'm working it out.&nbsp; Better days tomorrow!  Peace.&nbsp;

      Just&nbsp; wrapping up some efforts on posting my pic here and on an online personals page.  I sent my brother home after a couple of hours of talking to him about his life and mine. He hasn't been up to michigan for at least five years and it makes my mother cry for joy that all four of her children are together for these few weeks.  I am glad he's not a mean ass anymore.&nbsp; He has a down to earth quality, drives a cab for extra money in Savannah, Georgia.&nbsp; He likes fishing for sharks and working on docks.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's&nbsp;going to go to truck driving school in Dayton, Ohio, so he's hanging in the Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti area for the next week or two to visit his family.  How did we all end up where we are?

      Yesterday I went to Yessa's house with Ryan.&nbsp; She had just received a Warrior's Notebook from JizaiArts.com.&nbsp; It is a very cool tome with training tips and skills.&nbsp; My challenge was that I was tired, and I just couldn't bring myself to read any of it.   My energy has been quite, well, unergetic lately.&nbsp; I sit down to study, I get distracted easily.&nbsp; I think about training, I visualize it, but I haven't followed through on my own time in a week.&nbsp; That's not typical.   I have about a year to reach my next big goal in my martial arts training, and I need to get started.   I have at least come upon one new skill: when watching badly choreographed fight scenes in film and tv, I visualize what I would do in that scenario as it unfolds on the screen.&nbsp;  Por ejemplo:  in watching  Beverly Hills Ninja,  I saw a dumb fight scene in which&nbsp;the "good guy" locked out a man's arm and threw him into a table of food. &nbsp;I saw in my mind's eye that straight arm of the "bad guy" being turned into a shoulder dislocation technique.   Enough for now.

      tonight I hit the seen to follow a lead on a potential relationship interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; Survey says:&nbsp; No.  Ah, well, it was a good enough night.&nbsp; Went to the nearest dance club, mostly watched bouncers and management move around the people dancing. The patrons weren't even aware what kind of energy the employees had.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ryan and I watched as people just spent their time worrying about themselves.&nbsp; And booty. People definately worried about the booty.&nbsp; That seemed to be played out in a mere hour or so.  Next on the scene was Abe's Coney &nbsp;Island.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan ate eggs and meat, I had the&nbsp;hippy breakfast.&nbsp;There was a troupe of musicians/dancers up from South America eating food as well. They are familiar in&nbsp;that every year they come up to Ann Arbor to perform at the Art Fair.  Ryan and I just talked about what we talk about: work, relationships, and personal development. There is always the occasional pop culture reference, but the majority of our conversation is about our careers as martial artists and what kind of artists we are and are developing into.  Next stop was a visit to a smut peddler we know from different times and places. I know this man from high school theater, where he was given the unfortunate nickname "Twit."&nbsp; Ryan knows him from his work in a kitchen on Main&nbsp;Street in Ann Arbor.&nbsp;&nbsp; We refused to be abashed in his surroundings. Ryan and he talked&nbsp;about&nbsp;their joint social background; I&nbsp;am a few years too old for that scene, and the drama of that group would have lent&nbsp; me the desire to murder someone.&nbsp; They are drifting ever further away from that high school melodrama&nbsp;taken too far and carried on for too long.&nbsp; Josh is a good guy working on improving his life.  We moved on to walking in the neighborhoods around our fair city. After failing to crash a party, it was back to my home.  I am amazed people can operate at the level of late-night madness that I find a constant in college towns.&nbsp; My world just isn't there.&nbsp;

      Once more, here I&nbsp; am trying to be web chique.&nbsp; Second Blog, second chance to connect to the faceless User of the web.&nbsp; Maybe I will put some work into this one.&nbsp; We shall see.&nbsp;  Current state: Back is tight and hip is sore from rolling on concrete last night.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was fun, and continues to be.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are a&nbsp; martial artist&nbsp; and you don't practice your ukemi, what are you doing with your time?  Until next time: Ciao!

      It's been a busy weekend. I saw Josh and Amy on Friday, and we had a decent run of chatting and hanging out. On Saturday I went to Detroit to C-Pop Gallery for an art show opening with Pat, Sarah, and Andrew. Yessa was slated to make it out "as soon as possible," which turned out to be 11:10 in the p.m. Today featured a picnic at Island Park on the north side of Ann Arbor for the community of the dojo, religious services, and laundry. All in all, it was a good weekend, but it was so busy, I don't feel that I have had the rest I normally would have before getting back to work for the weekend.  Tomorrow Colleen is going to call so we can set up our coffee date. I'm looking forward to it.  May all beings be well!

      Running low on fundage again, but this time its because I am trying to budget for a vacation I am spending with my family. Nonetheless, I went to the Blind Pig in Ann Arbor to see Sound Team and The Walkmen. I went with Ryan and his crew, but gratefully ran in to Josh Steichmann, friend and former housemate.  I look forward to seeing him on Friday.  Also on tap for Friday:  housecleaning. Jan, my landlord, is coming over so  that I can sign the lease, so I have to make the place look spiffy.  Other good news: Keith and Donna ( mis jefes ) have a plan to reduce the cost of my personal martial arts training and to give me (dare I hope for it!) health insurance. I am SOOOO geeked about this, but it depends on increasing our student count at the dojo.  Finally, I received a phone call from a woman I asked out for coffee.  Problem is, she left no message, so I don;t know if its a "yea!" or "nay!"    More on that later...  My best to everyone!

      Not much to talk about today.  I realized that since I stopped going to religious services on Wednesday nights, I have been working about 3 more hours a week, and haven't been paid for that. It's all right on one hand, because I love what I do, even when I am having a horrible day, I appreciate my work.  On the other hand, I need to make sure my schedule is working for me in every way possible. Ah, well, what can I do?  Peace.

      Ah!   Good times!  Last night I went to my folks house to do laundry and watch movies.  I watched  Hellboy  and  The Whole Ten Yards .   I'm all about Hellboy, because I think its the most boss comic ever. The film  doesn't quite do justice to the characters (imho).  I feel that Hellboy is a lot more mature than given credit for, and I think Liz Sherman was also too adolescent in the film. The visuals were great, but the amalgamation of "Seed of Destruction" and "Right Hand of Doom" was a little wonky for flow.  The best feature was the easter egg of quotes from Del Toro.    The Whole Ten Yards  was good dumb fun.  I woke this morning-ish around 11:50 and watched curriculum video tapes to get ready for teaching level 2 classes at the dojo for the next month. I did that for about 2  and a half hours and headed off to the temple.  I met some cool people today after meditation service.  After chatting with a woman named Colleen about Buddhism, I went to the diag to review my notes from watching the curriculum tapes and wait for Andrew, my housemate, to get done with his religious services at Canterbury House. When he showed up we took off to good ole Ypsitucky.   We cleaned up the kitchen tonight.  Damn this entry has funky flow.  That's what happens when you write and watch Family Guy at the same time.   Good night, all.
