      The Oregon Zoo, to which my lovely wife and I are members, has a couple of good things to do to beat the summer heat. One of our favs is the Polar Bear exhibit. On a hot summer day, they're likely to be swimming, and it's a hoot to watch them from underground. They are great, hairy, graceful behemoths in the water. Kids tend to crowd the windows and bang on the glass, which their idiot parents freely allow. I don't let that bad behavior to spoil my experience but as a result, I do find myself planting myself in front of windows and other views with no guilt, even though I block it for others for a brief time- it's just a self-defense thing.   The other fav of mine is the Lorikeets, whom you can feed for $1. They are colorful and noisy, and not afraid to take what they want. They'll also poop on unsuspecting bystanders so you have to watch out. People love to give small children food cups for the birds, only to watch the more timid kids wail in fear when the birds dive in for the food.   Kids are also frequently frightened by the Himalamazon thrill ride, which is kind of a movie/roller coaster combo. I like it because it is air-conditioned excitement - we went with my brother in-law yesterday and because the kid beside him cried and his seat had to be stopped, we all 3 got another free ride. Wahoo!   In the cool bat cave, the fox bats will happily dine on fruit and broccoli, as well as try to mate. I saw one male try to move in behind a female and mate with her, but she reached up between her legs and nipped his little balls and put an end to that. I had to laugh - she plainly said, "Take that, you impudent little bugger!"  Some people say the zoo is for little kids, but my wife and I disagree. It's plainly for adults who love animals and nature and for older and braver kids.

      Nothin' tastes better than cold microbrew on a hot day, and that's what we got at the Bite. The wineries were also out in force doing their pretty good thing, and even Budweiser was there claiming it uses Willamette Valley hops. I stuck to my favorite Widmer all the same. We took the venerable Yellow Line down to Waterfront Park and joined the throngs for some excellent King salmon in Pinot Gris huckleberry sauce, some fondue in a tiny bread bowl (from a German restaraunt called the "Berlin Inn" that claims it will hosting "Barktoberfest" in a few weeks), some very tasty Marionberry pie and some excellent zydeco. It's all about "Brand Oregon" this year, and berries were represented very well. It's so good!   I swear I've never seen so many Hawaiian shirts. Don't know why other than this is an attempt to suggest it's party time. I wish summer here could last forever.

      Last night my sweetie got off early from work and we celebrated by going to the "Lovely Hula Hands" restaraunt off super trendy Mississippi Avenue. It's a remodeled house kind of not near anything, really - hard to find unless you spot its bright pink exterior as you happen to be driving by on the way to somewhere else. It was lovely food, don't know whose hula hands prepared it.  Then we drove out into the Gorge on the Old Scenic Highway, which is still scenic even at night. We stopped at a small park up a few hundred feet elevation from the Columbia River called "Women's Forum Park" (odd name), because it had a low-lit spot for looking at the stars. It was just 20 miles out of Portland, but what a difference it makes to be away from all that light pollution! We lay on our backs in the grass and snuggled as we watched the meteors zip by, and tried to keep over over-excited dog from barking at everyone else.   Our sweet dog is a 70-pound, gorgeous chocolate lab mix from the Multnomah County Animal Shelter. We love her dearly. Although she gets taken to Portland Parks routinely, she almost never goes out at night, and the spookiness of the dark brought out her inner watchdog. She just wouldn't settle down and shut up. After a spell of trying to amuse herself by lying on her back in imitation of us, she grew bored and kept standing over us and goofily looking down in our faces and blocking our view as we tried to look up at the stars, walking on our heads and other body parts, and tangling us up in her leash. She finished her evening banished to the back of the car.   Nonetheless, it was most romantic and a wonderful August evening.

      This was Kerry vs. Bush day today in PDX. It was hard to get any news coverage given that there were a few other fascinating things competing, like Mighty Hurricane Charley in Florida, a resigning and newly out governor in New Jersey, and the opening of the Olympic games in Athens. Oh, and that pesky situation in the middle east.   Anyway, for those of us actually paying attention, we enjoyed a very interesting juxtaposition of styles. Bush played to a small group of invitation-only small business owners in Beaverton. Kerry held a huge rally in Portland's Waterfront Park to which anyone could come. There were lots of body blows, hair pulling and illegal chair usages. Although I didn't hear much new on either side, I have to award my vote for the winner to Kerry for style - hands down!

       urlLink    Oregon is berrie land and there are no better berries than those purchased at a roadside stand (except those you pick yourself). Rusty the dawg picks her own - she just mouths an entire clump of berries, stickers and all. Spicy!&nbsp; urlLink

      Today is the second day of a "severe smog alert" here in the City of Roses. I could see it, taste it and even feel the weight of it on the drive home from Salem - a brown haze that obliterated the views of the mountains, reminded me of L.A., and caused me to want to drive like some kind of crazed fiend to get out of it and stop contributing to it. The sick thing is, our air quality is still rated "good". Compared to what?! I shudder to think.  Nothing sours my psyche more, because I've always felt a slightly smug little spark of joy knowing that the air quality here has always been better than most other places I've lived in my life. It is due in part to a series of 90+ degree days - another thing people don't think about when they imagine Portland. But, an arid desert we do become each summer. It is normally a coolish green city with lots of trees and fresh air and more than its fair share of misty rain.   Simultaneouly, and perhaps even more frightening, global warming is being blamed for the new dead zone that covers an alarming range of Oregon coastline. Everything in its path is killed due to oxygen depleted cold waters that creep up from the deep. It's kind of like all those deaths caused by earthquakes near ancient lakes that are filled with toxic gasses trapped near the lakebed an held in place by algea.   Yuck. I've got to find a job that allows me to walk or bike to work.

      When my lovely lesbian wife and I first moved to the Rose City, we lived in a trendy NE neighborhood. It was, by PDX standards, a pain in the ass. Too crowded, too noisy, piggish neighbors, and way too much traffic. Given that Bridgetown is one easy place to get around, that's saying something.  Soon, we came to our senses and moved to what is rapidly becoming another trendy neighborhood. Now we live in hot hot hot Overlook. We are rather pleased with ourselves for picking so well (although we still have some piggish neighbors).  Yes, we lucky denizens of NoPo (that's North Portland to the less hip among us) get to ride the newly opened Light Rail line, a line colored yellow for cheerfulness and optimism. The line has all sorts of cool art embedded in it, on the stations, along the sidelines, in the accompanying new businesses, and there's even poetry on the inside of the trains. It gives us something to look at while we are trying to avoid making eye contact with the crazy/drunk/hostile homeless person sitting across from us.  It is the yellow line of hope that will take me down to the Waterfront on Friday to see John Kerry stumping in Stumptown. I understand such luminaries as Jon Bon Jovie and Leonarda diCaprio (or "de Craprio" as someone once called him) will be joining the party. I'm happy to have them join the dogpile and all, but neither of these glam fellows exactly appeals to the prototypical Portland dweller's sense of style. We're quirky here and we like things a little dark around the edges; not too easily accessed; not too marketable by the mainstream.

       Today I begin Amble Forth!  I have lived in Portland, Ore. for just over seven years now, which is long enough to have observed the place in some depth but not so long as to have accepted the conditions here as routine. This blog will chronicle my observances of life in the mildly moist city I have chosen as a current roosting spot.       There are many oddities and wonders here, starting with our peculiar habit of referring to the place as 'Portland, Ore.', rather than simply 'Portland, OR.' as our more efficient neighbor states do. Why the extra 'e'? Who the heck knows, but we seem to like it that way since I see it posted everywhere. Perhaps it is telling that I see it posted most commonly on the sides of commercial trucks on my daily commute between Bridgetown and Salem.
