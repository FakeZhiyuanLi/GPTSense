      I'll be running the sound for Madison Middle School's play, "The Wizard of Oz" So far, I have 6  urlLink Sennheiser wirless mics , plus 3 other crappy Samson woreless mics, that are on their last legs. I may just use these as spares. I also have a Mackie 8ch powered mixer. So, right now I need to get a real mixer. Tried buying one off ebay, it went over the max I was going to bid. I also need alot of XLR and 1/4" cable.  The show is takes place in less than 2 weeks.  This could be a royal PITA, or a major success. I hope it is succesfull

      This is my first post.So, I'll tell you a little bit about me, and what is going on in my life right now.   I build fighting robots (Battlebots, Robot Wars, etc.)  for a hobby. I am the Vice-PResident of my school's AudioVisual Club. The director is retiring this year, and the town is not going to be hiring someone in his place. So, no more AV club. I am very disgusted by this. I think that, next year they will be looking for someone to fill that position, after realizing that there will be no band concerts, no chorus concerts, no plays, no channell 17(and they are even paying $$$ to upgrade the studio) no equipment repairs, and many aggrivated teachers.

      After a lot of troubleshooting yesterday, the sound is working perfectly, and in stereo, might I add. And today, I fixed a few problems. Such as the condenser 'choral' mics requiring 9v batteries. They eat them quickly. So, I'm running phantom power now, which seems to be problem with the piano, but I just need to find a way to disable the speaker on the piano really. Another problem I have to deal with tomorrow is that we need to add in an echo generater the night of a show. Because the wizard just NEEDs to have an echo. I really think the show will be a huge success, or it will at least sound good.

      Earlier today, I went to Altel Sound Systems to rent the snake I needed for the play. I told thema week ago, "I need an 8ch 50ft, XLR snake for next week" Altel says "Sure, no problem!" Toady, I call again and say "I'm coming to pick up the snake" "Oh, um we might not have what you need. " So I tell them what I need, they say they have opne that is way bigger than what I need. Not a problem, bigger is always better. So I drive down there and they thought I needed it for just tonight. "So, they had to keep the big one, as it was needed for another production on Thursday. The guy there ended up pulling out thew oldest, dirtiest, smelliest snake they had. He tested it, and it worked. Yay! So I pay him $30 (good deal) and I'm on my way home.  But, I do like them too. They put in the new sound system at THS, and they supplied our wireless microphones as well as pretty much any other sound stuff at THS.   urlLink http://andyspalla.2ya.com/images/snake.jpg  (362k)
