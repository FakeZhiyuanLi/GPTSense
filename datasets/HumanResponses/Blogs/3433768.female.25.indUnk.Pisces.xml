      My neighbor, who has previously been a jackass of enormous proportions, has returned from his Memorial Day weekend.  How do I know?  Because he's tooling around down there with some crumby music on, or a video game or something.  He doesn't know how to keep the volume of things at an acceptible level.  He leaves his amp cranked up (to 11) and has his two "Fuck you!" "No, Fuck you!" jackass friends over until all hours.  I was kind of hoping he was gone for the summer with a job in his home town, but it seems my speculation that he'd be in summer school was accurate.    He recently got a new girlfriend (or one-nighter, since I haven't heard her over there since), and that night he played his bassy music until 4am, at which time the headboard started hitting the wall, and she started screaming. I didn't want to call management about this, so I made a point to talk very loudly the next day about how the loser (he really is a loser, you should see him) had gotten laid, and wasn't I embarassed for him, etc.  I don't know if he heard me, but she hasn't been back since.  Sixty days until he moves to a different apartment.  At least the apartment complex management like me enough to tell me these things.   Today I spent the entire day on the internet reading about Italy and Sicily.  There's a 25% chance (and probably lower, actually) that a paper I wrote will be accepted to a conference in Sicily, and I will get to go to the conference to talk about it.  Since this means a mostly free trip to Italy, I figured I'd spend an extra week there.  Yes, the odds are very low that the paper will be accepted, but it's fun to dream.  In my little dream, I'm going to fly into Sicily, landing on Sunday morning.  Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is the conference, ending Wednesday afternoon.  Wednesday afternoon I'll take one of the fast trains from the boot tip of Italy to Naples where I'll stay until Friday morning.  Friday morning I'll go to Rome by train, and see Rome until I leave for Florence on Monday morning.  I'll leave Florence for Venice on Wednesday morning, and leave Venice for Rome on Friday morning.  Saturday morning I'll catch a plane out of Rome for Newark.  The problem with this plan is which kind-souls will pet-sit for me and take me to Newark.  It's a long vacation to take, I know, but when will I get this opportunity to get out there for so cheap again?  And how much longer do I have to wait.  Just reading about Italy made me hungry for it.  The little cafes, the history, the people... all things I want to be a part of.  I'm sure "Under the Tuscan Sun" egged this on, too.  Meanwhile, I was reading about Malta.  Malta, while beautiful, is an island whose mainland is ten miles across, and not as many tall.  Who let them be a country?  They have population 300,000, which is like a small, suburban neighborhood.  There are probably three grocery stores.  It would be like letting Martha's Vineyard become its own country.    Even weirder than that, though, is the country of Monaco, which is 0.76 square miles.  France wants to reannex them as soon as there are no more heirs to the throne.  I can't believe the French army couldn't just go in there and take them over.  The only thing Monaco is good for as a country is the Monte Carlo district, which I guess France might not allow.  So does Monaco get the same votes in the UN as, say, Brazil?  Uncanny.

      I'm on a quest to do everything better in my life.  This past year was kind of  meh  for me, and I think we can do better than that.  I'm going to try to put more effort into everything I do (I wonder if this happens to all people who join a gym), and get good at things I usually do half-assed-ly.  This includes cooking, working, and even putzing around.   Most importantly, I want to stop being a vegetable so much of the time (although I do love my tv) and start to go out to do things.  My friends talk about all these things they do together, and I keep realizing that I don't get invited.  I can't figure it out.  Maybe they jumped on the do everything better ship a while ago, and they didn't think I wanted on.  As another part of my do everything better scheme, next time I bake a cake, it's going to be perfect looking.  As a counter to that, though, I can't have cake right now since the other part of my do everything better scheme is to get down to 120lbs.  So I guess I'll be decorating thin air for a while.  eep.   I didn't sweat as much at the gym today because I was learning how to use that wacko machine called the EFX, which seems to be a glorified stairmaster.  I call it the Gazelle machine because people who use it remind me of gazelles (and I believe there may actually be a similar machine called the Gazelle).  Anyway, this machine takes a lot of coordination between your arms and legs.  You have to move your arms at exactly the right pace in accordance to your legs' pace, and then you have to try to keep your feet entirely on the platform for maximum quadricep action.  I almost fell off.  Then when I thought I was doing pretty well, this woman gets on the one next to me and just goes at it like it's second nature ("You're watching the  sports ," she says, as if I should have been watching Sponge Bob on the other tv).  Then she gets her water bottle and drinks while she's still going and makes it look easy.  Finally I get thirsty, and decide if she can do it, so can I.  Wrong.  I almost fell off the machine again.  And then I spilled water all down my chin and front.  But I guess nobody gets embarassed at the gym because we all look stupid in some way.

      "Big Fish" was a really good movie.  I thought about trying to copy it to vhs to save, but it's probably encrypted, and even if it's not, I'd have to bother hooking my dvd player to my vcr to find out.  Six people came over to watch, and we had a pretty good time.  After the movie was over, we stayed up talking until just recently (around 2:30).  Not nearly enough drinkin' and partyin' though.  But we did get a newcomer.  His name's Tyler, and I think I've met him before, maybe in a class or something.  Of course my perpetually broken gaydar is still broken.  I need to admit to myself that everyone who I do not already know to be heterosexual is not.  Tomorrow I will go to work and then to the gym, or to the gym and then to work.  Either way, I have to be home by 10 for "Buffy".  Sad when I schedule my days around "Buffy", but it's a very important show.  Unfortunately, it's late now, so I'll probably sleep in until 11 and then not leave the house until 1.  But sleeping late and lounging... that is the good life!

      It's Memorial Day Weekend, I've finished my taxes, and it's sunny outside.  I spent the morning cleaning my apartment for tonight's shindig -- we're watching "Big Fish".  I don't know how many people are coming, because, as usual, almost no one rsvp's.  I'm guessing around seven people will show up.  I'm hoping I like "Big Fish" because I really like most of Tim Burton's other stuff, and I haven't heard any bad reviews yet.  I went to the gym today and saw TJ there, who is, unfortuantely, switching gyms.  TJ showed me some abs workouts and told me he might come tonight.  I feel really tired from the stairmaster today.  Every minute on that thing is like an hour.  I hope I start seeing some results soon.  I may need motivation soon -- I definitely need weekend motivation.  Going on weekdays is easy because I'm already at work, but leaving the house to go work out isn't so easy.  And when the only thing on the gym TV is "Rocky", a movie where you get to watch Sly work out (and do it better than you're doing it), it's not inspiring.  Last night I stayed in and watched most of "The Cheateau", a movie with Paul Rudd, which wasn't very good.  The filming was grainy, and the acting was sub-par, but the story was unique, so I gave it about 3/4 of the length before I got bored and turned it off.  Luckily, when I turned it off, "Las Vegas" (the tv show) was on.  But something that never ceases to amaze me is that when I only watch a show in reruns, I see the same episodes over and over again.  There could be as many as 200 episodes out there, and I'll see the same four over and over again.  I'm jinxed.  I've only seen one episode of "The Hogan Family", but I've seen it three times.  People should start coming over in a little over an hour, and I have to decide if I'm going to put on clothes that aren't my pajamas.  It may take an hour to do that.  Also, Reggie likes cran-apple juice.  That can't be bad, right?

       I love silver gelatin photographs.  I love just about any art, but I prefer classic looking designs (although I have a hard time describing "classic").  I don't see nearly enough art.  I should get to more museums.  I love Degas, especially, and would love to have one of his dancers on a wall in my house.  Finding a picture that I'll want to see at every day is hard.  Once you get something nice, you're stuck with it, more or less, unless you're able to afford new pictures all the time or trade with friends.  Mostly, I prefer the pictures on my walls to be of places, not people (excluding personal photographs, which are proudly displayed around all the rooms).  But I would make an exception for one of Degas' dancers.    I also like art that's original.  That's not to say that copies are bad (especially since only one person can have the original!), but I like to think that what I have is unique.  I have this fabulous drawing and watercolor that I bought at an antique store in D.C. of a house.  The house looks like a little brownstone with three stories, and it's probably a place in the DC area.  It's super cute, and I know there aren't any others like it in the world.  It's like the artist and I share a little secret.  Today I went to health services to see about summer health insurance.  They were less than helpful.  It appears that I will be insuranceless until August 1.  I hope I don't get clubbed with a baseball bat or something before then.  I'm working today until 5, at which time I'll go to the gym and run for an hour ("Angel" is on at 5!), and then I'll go home and watch a movie and finish my taxes.  Last night I watched "S1M0NE", which was a pretty good flick.  I didn't expect much out of it.

       The Ground Rule Trouble won today.  We're such a kickass team.  Oddly, though, somehow I always manage to get hurt.  Tonight I got bowled over by this guy charging home plate (wtf kind of league is this?).  It was one of those slow-motion moments where you turn around from reaching for the ball only to find this green shirt looming at your face.  Then you're on the ground.  Their catcher is kind of a butch woman.  I don't remember her from past years, although she was apparently there.  She reminds me of this other chick I used to know, though.  Funny, because both women are very vocal (not to mention a tad irritating).  You could tell she was the type who heckled for a living.  She's the type who always raised her hand in class and looked like she really knew what shew was talking about.  Even when she knew the answer was wrong, just to prove some other fact that she knew.  And now she's giving upcoming batters a headache by telling them that "that's not what   would do".  ugh.  I went to the gym today and caught the first few minutes of "Angel" on tv, which made me wish I had come later, but, alas, we had the game.  I think I caught the series right at the middle of the first season.  I can almost justify the cost of the gym now as getting cable, since I don't get TNT at home.  Then, after my 2.25 miles, I saw Toni there.  She's super nice.  Maybe I'll have a workout buddy, after all.  At least it seemed like she'd go to step classes with me when I start those.  As a both bad and good thing, my mom sent me home baked cookies (upon request).  They're yummy but do nothing for my "eating right" plan.  Dinner tonight was half a bag of Chex Mix and four cookies.  Meanwhile, I'm still really pissed off at DMB for telling me "it didn't pan out" for me this term and then comparing me to Vanessa.  It's not that Vanessa's a bad person to be, but I like to think I'm not like anyone else in the department (or the world, for that matter).  Twenty more points on that final and I would have passed the class.  At least I have Reggie.

      Today I got a pep talk from my advisor.  I'm still behind, but not as much as we all thought.  Coursework is messy.  PhDs are messy.  I don't know why I'm here.  But that aside, today is a much brighter day than yesterday.  I was consoled by the fact that a friend overseas had a bad day yesterday, too; at least I wasn't alone.  Today we have a softball game, and I'm going to the gym to run beforehand.    Saturday night I'm hosting a movie night at my apartment.  My neighbor is out of town, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to have people over and make some noise without looking like a hypocrite.  The down side to having people over is (and I'm sure this happens everywhere) once you invite one person, you're obligated to invite this other person, which means you need to invite these two people, and soon the list is up to 15 people in my tiny little apartment.  I don't like to hurt feelings, so I invite them all and hope that a few of them have better plans.  No matter who shows up, it should be fun (but the less people I have to feed, the better!)  I've had the songs "Maria" and "Tonight" from "West Side Story" stuck in my head for days now.  So far it hasn't bothered me, but I'm sure it will become a problem in the next few days.  The intro to "Tonight" where they sing the duet "...Only you, you're the only one I need, forever..." has the most awesome chord progressions that I never noticed before a few days ago.  It has a pretty strong impact.  That Bernstein really had something going for him.  In "Maria" there's one point where Tony sounds a lot like Mandy Patinkin.  It's very strange.

      Four miles on the treadmill today, followed by crunches and pushups.  Why, you ask, would I do that so soon after starting?  Because I had to work off more aggression and agitation.  I've started rethinking why I'm in graduate school; I don't know if I'll stay past this summer.  Do I really want to do research?  And why?  And do I really want another year of jumping through hoops?  I'm in the market for a local best friend, both for a shoulder to cry on and so I can do fun things with my free time, not alone.  I also ate an entire Red Baron's pizza.  Keep in mind that while these pizzas are smaller than Domino's pizzas, they're not meant to be eaten by one person in one sitting.  Unlike the other two or three times I've finished an entire pizza on my own, though, this time it hurt to eat those last three pieces.  This means that I was well on my way to eating reasonable amounts of food, and possibly losing a little weight (until tonight).  Even though today mostly sucked, it could be worse.  I could be on my way to prison for a life sentence for a crime I didn't commit.  In prison I probably wouldn't be allowed to watch all the "Law and Order" I watch right now.  Luckily, there's another "Law and Order" on after this episode, so at least I'm all set for the night.      Today I found another pretty aurora borealis picture.  Why hasn't one ever come my way?  They seem like something that would be so awesome in real life.  Then again, I've never found a double-dyed penny or won the lottery, so I don't know what I'm complaining about.  I wish I could win the lottery (but I'd probably have to play it, first).  Tomorrow's a softball game; maybe I should start small and just wish to win that.

      I got in today and downloaded the firefighter data.  Ten of the sixteen devices worked properly, which leads me to believe that handing out thirty will give us really good results.  I'm in mild pain from yesterday.  Muscles in my calves that I didn't remember existed are aching, and climbing the stairs was fatiguing.  All the same, I can't wait to hit the gym again today.  It's a crappy, rainy day out, and for some reason it's just really appealing to go to the gym to run around out of the rain.  I hope I don't want to continue past August because the undergrads will be unbearable I think.  Last night when I got home, someone was setting off fireworks, and there was at least one set of people in the next apartment complex over having a good old time.  I don't know why the celebration so late in the game, but good for them (as long as they don't come near my apartment).  Then I heard a giant crack, which at the time I thought was a gunshot or a large firework mishap.  With these undergrads around here, you can never tell.  Well, this morning when I woke up and looked out the window, the big, old tree on the lawn had lost one of its bigger branches (at least 20 feet long).  I have no doubt now that that's what the giant crack was.  It thunderstormed a little last night, so maybe the tree was hit by lightning or it was too windy.  I find it funny that I can't remember if it was raining or not when the giant crack happened; I was just so set on the fact that it was a firework or gunshot.  At any rate, the tree, which is a very lovely tree, is now going to look a little bare, which is unfortunate for my view.

      I went to the fire drill tonight at Tillson Farm, which is the giant steam plant on the top of a hill -- brilliant, engineers.  I think the data I collected worked out.  We'll know tomorrow.  While at the drill, I picked some daisies that were very pretty, but when I got them home, they were bug-ridden (surprise).  They're on my porch now.  I also went to the gym today where I ran 1.5 miles and then did the stairmaster.  That stairmaster is a Killer!  I pushed myself to do exactly five minutes.  It hurt like nothing else.  I also found the gym mats and medicine balls so I can do stretches and stuff.  I like the summer because there are less people to look like a goofball in front of.  There was a semi-cute (short) boy there who kept checking himself out in the mirror after every set of reps.  Gyms are mildly amusing.

        I got to work today and fed Gabby.  Then I read the newspaper and every other website I've already read in an attempt to not do work.  Finally I bared down and did a little work.  I also emailed the fire chief, who will probably let me come to drill tonight to do my data collection.  Unfortunately, this means I'll miss softball.  Luckily, the gym is still open until 9pm, so I might get a good run in today, anyway.  I'm a little sore from yesterday, but it's a good sore, not an I-can't-move sore.  What I'd really like to do is have the endurance to exercise just all day long.  I bet that would be fun, although not very profitable.  My advisor gets lonely easily.  He comes down here to my office almost predictably.  The worst part is, when I'm in the middle of web surfing (or blog-writing in this most recent case), I feel the need to close the browser so that he doesn't know what I'm up to.  Then I get all awkward and try to convince him that I really was doing work.  It's a very odd situation.

      All of the regular season tv shows have had their season finales now, leaving me to watch either crap, reruns, or shows I didn't really want to watch first time around.  Strangely, we've started seeing this new phenomenon in the last five or so years (well, new as far as I know) of summer season tv shows.  There's a new one starting on the WB called Summerville or Summerplace or Summercrap about a group of raukus party people who live on the beach and surf all day.  Then one day they get the call that auntie X died and now they (all of them??) have to take care of her four or six little rugrats.  Give up the party life and learn to be adults, meanwhile corrupting the kids just enough to make a saucy tv show.  The premise sounds surprisingly like Party of Five, a show I didn't like the first time around.  I don't know why the tv social workers see fit to have these people, who would in real life be deemed unfit parents, take care of the mushy little minds.  I'll take that fourth incarnation of Law and Order now.  And while I'm monologuing about television, let's not forget to mention the holier-than-thou's who brag all the time about how they don't own a tv (I ran into one last week).  When I mention some tv episode, and the response is "oh, I don't own a tv.  I feel that [you are a lesser person than I and] tv is bad," I don't take it personally; I've stopped listening.  For a while I was almost convinced that tv rots the brain.  Then I realized that tv's fabulous, and some of the programs I watch (admittedly, Nova is the best for this) lead me to do more impressive things with my time, like convince me to read books or learn more about the law or how stuff works.  Of course smart shows (and episodes) are often counteracted by mind numbing shows (and episodes) on lipstick shades or vapid people staring at each other.  But I take the bad with the good, and when I ask, all you people who don't own a tv (on purpose) can just tell me you "didn't see the episode".  I went to the gym today like I said I would and signed up for the "summer special" which means I'll be going through August.  I ran 2.5 miles today at 5.0 mph, thoroughly impressing myself.  If it rains tomorrow (it's been raining all day today) and softball is cancelled, I'll go again and try the stairmaster or bikes.  I hate to say it, but I think I like the gym.  It also helps that there was a cute runner on the treadmill next to me (7.0 mph, I noticed!)  I hope I'm able to keep up this much writing once the blog loses its novelty... or at least through the summer.  Maybe this could end up like Bridget Jones' Diary (a book that didn't entirely draw me in).  Also, I may speak too soon, but my neighbor seems to be gone for the evening.  It's been exceptionally quiet down there tonight.  I'm afraid that he's taking summer school, though, so he won't be gone long if he actually leaves at all.    Last thought: I had an awful dream last night wherein I had the choice to stay in or move out of my apartment, but if I moved, it had to be back into the Old Place (bad times).  When I (obviously) decided to stay in my current apartment, I found out that it wasn't really my apartment, but a house I shared with two girls I didn't know.  I lived in the attic, which had its own bathroom and an extra room for a mini-living-room (the funny thing about the mini-living-room is that I didn't know it existed until the realtor showed me it was there:  (a) why did I have a realtor for an apartment I supposedly already lived in and (b) why didn't I ever open the extra DOOR in the bedroom that lead to that mini-living-room to discover it was there).  The mini-living-room was furnished with dust bunnies and an ugly, overturned rose-colored couch.  The most bizarro part about the apartment, though, was that when I went downstairs to the kitchen to find my kitchenware (so I could pack it into boxes?? weird), I opened the kitchen cupboards to find tupperware.  I have never seen this much tupperware in my life.  There were all shapes and sizes of tupperware, but the most common was the lasagne-sized tupperware container.  There were at least 20 of these, not nested as that would save space, but sealed and stacked in the cupboards and ready for use.  There were no cups, no silverware, no pots.  Just tupperware and... wait for it ...one cupboard Full of pink polka dotted plastic dinner plates.  There must have been 100 of them, all stacked brick-style (staggered, not directly on top of each other).  Useful.  When I woke up, I didn't really know where I was, but I was glad it wasn't that place.

      I hate to say it, but I think I've surfed the entire internet.  I've offhandedly made this claim before, but this time I think it's for real.  I'm done, and believe me, I know way too much crap information.  I just had lunch with John and his sister, who are packing him up to leave for CT tomorrow morning.  He gave me Edward Scissorhands (once Gabby) to take care of for the summer.  Already, though, Edward seems as sad as I am to see John go.  Melody and Chad will take care of Edward in the fall, and I guess he looks forward to that.  But he's a fish, so one never knows.  Anyway, I'll see John later this summer in CT/NY, so no big whoppers of tears yet!  Boris told me today that I don't have to love my job; it's just my job.  I should love my life, though.  Unfortunately, this grad school thing is more a life than a job, which means I have to like it.  I have a hard time deciding where I would go if I left.  If I were to go back to the government, I may as well stay here and at least get a degree for the work.  Maybe the best answer is to take Brian's offer that I do my research from not-Amherst once I'm done with classes.  Today I'm going to the gym.  I'm going to run off all of this aggression and aggravation.  Then I'm going to sit back and watch lots of tv.  I hope it stops raining so I can play softball tomorrow night.

      The only way I could see to escape the culture that is "computer science" was to start a blog.  It seems ironic (is this the right use?) that I would escape computers by using them for other things.  But if I write about the fun things I do in life, perhaps it will inspire me to do more fun things.  Let me start with the bad and get on to the good.  I want two years of my life back: 2001-2003.  If anyone can do that for me, I'd appreciate it.  Meanwhile, I'm thinking of following a recent trend and blowing this popsicle stand with a masters.  It might just be time to get on with my life, not be in a college town, and do something I enjoy.  I'm still thinking about it.  I also fear that I'll keep thinking about it and just sit around unhappily in grad school because it's the "easy way out" (rather than apply for a job, etc).  That said, I had a pretty fun Friday night.  I went to Dan & Ann's house where they were having a BBQ (and since it's recently Spring, the little buggies were out en masse -- ugh), and drank a lot.  We played wiffle ball, and I scored a run.  And everyone else played hold'em, and I watched.  I think I've got the hang of the hold'em odds, so maybe one of these weeks I'll join in (except that it's run by someone who doesn't seem to like me anymore).  By the end of the evening I was slurring my words (a point I never like to get to) and had lost my lipstick (which pisses me off because (a) it'll be hard to find that color again and (b) I didn't even use that color Friday), but I didn't care so much because I was good and drunk.  I stumbled home and fell into bed, waking up early with a hangover, not too bad but irritating.    Saturday was lost to lying around and a trip to Barnes and Noble.  On much recommendation, I bought _The Da Vinci Code_, by Dan Brown, and when I got it home, I read the first two chapters, which were written very condescendingly (let me tell you what the Louvre is...).  So I skimmed ahead.  The "puzzle" he was trying to solve wasn't ridiculously challenging, and when I skimmed ahead to the end, I wasn't impressed.  So I gave up on it, and returned it today (that you can return books to Barnes and Noble is one of the best things ever).  I think if I were a career-reader (like my mom) or if I were less well-read, I would have found it unique and fascinating.  However, such is not the case.  At least I have John's recommendation, _The Picture of Dorian Gray_, by Oscar Wilde, left to read.  Its main problem seems to be that the only copies B&N sells are the size of 3x5 index cards -- pocket books!  I'm also still waiting for my neighbor (and his neighbors) to move out.  Since graduation happened just today, I give them a week before I start to get surly on their asses.  In case the whole world doesn't know by now, they're assholes.  They stay up all hours of the night (every night) with either their amp turned up (to 11 I imagine!) or their 20 buddies over, drunk.  I'm sure they're fun people to party with, but certainly not fun people to live near.  This or next week I'll go to NYC to see "Wicked".  The Tony's are in just two weeks, and I may get to watch them on tv this year; I wonder if they're as boring as the Oscars.  This week is full of dullsville work and trace data collection, with few fun softball games thrown in.  At least the "Old Boy's Club" in my office seems to have broken up for the summer, which should make it easier to feel good about my work.  I'm also going to post a list of things I plan to do this summer.  I'm going to need willpower to get them all done.  Hopefully doing one or two will get the ball rolling.

      Quick and dirty allyc-bulletpoints:  It's Sunday again.  My advisor's back in town.  Baby bird has been delivered to the proper authorities (he ended up being a sparrow).  I got a gmail account.  Yesterday was a wash.  I made an ass out of myself at least three times this week.    Also, I can no longer say that boys don't like me.  Now I must qualify the statement with ...unless they are stalkers, crazy, boring, or all of the above.  I got an email from that goof that I met in a bar two weeks ago who I wasn't really into.  I met him in Boston.  He lives in Los Angeles.  I didn't give him my email address or phone number, but somehow he found me (not hard to do) and sent me a cheesy email.  I wouldn't be one to turn down cheesy emails except that I didn't originally like him, I didn't give him my email address, and he's in frickin' California.  Dear 3000 miles -- you're too far. -- love, ally.  I don't know if I'm going to write back.  I'm also convinced that there aren't any single, straight boys in Massachusetts who don't suck.  Today I have to do work work work because our publication deadline is in a week, but I thought I'd drive up to the Deerfield Academy or down to Mt. Holyoke first to walk around since it's such a nice day.  I've never been to either of those places, and I'm sure they'd remind me of my fun life before this one.  Days like today I almost feel like I could leave my apartment and just walk to Schneider for a Sunday burger and fries.  I miss that.

      Why is gmail so popular?  And why do I want it so badly?  I have absolutely no use for it except that everyone else seems to want it.  I have oodles of email accounts, most of which have easy to remember usernames.  This just shows to go you that I want what I can't have.  Or maybe I'm just bored and looking for an outlet for my time.  Today we found a baby blue bird -- probably about 10 days old, just getting its pin feathers in -- chirping in the garbage can.  Someone had thrown away its nest, probably on accident since there were two other babies who had died.  I imagine it fell out of a tree.  Anyway, mom certainly wasn't coming back to get baby bird, so I took him.  I went to the pet store to ask their advice, and tehy suggested I feed it crushed up mealy worms.  For those of you who don't know what mealy worms are -- yuck.  They crunch when you mash them and are just generally horrible.  Anyway, I successfully fed baby bird, and tomorrow morning I will take him to a rehab center so that he can move back into the wild.  This is my good deed for the week.

      It's been a hectic week around here.  I got my car fixed, renewed my library books, checked out a house for rent, did some actual work, and watched a few "Law & Order"s.  The most interesting, checking out the house for rent, actually took the least time.  I live alone right now, and four of my other friends just got a new house together.  This, of course, has made me jealous and long for someone to live with. However, I live alone because of some various incidents I had with past housemates.  I sure I can live with people again,  but they'd most certainly have to be the right people, lest I end up in another bad situation.  Anyway, this three bedroom house came up for rent the other day, and I did a drive by, and it seems pretty nice.  Unfortunately, I have no one to share it with, and I can't rent a three bedroom house by myself.  I found this neat website, grouphug.us, where people go to confess things.  I believe them when they say they don't do IP logging, and it really makes me want to confess something.  I can't think of anything confessional, though.  I'm sure there's something -- it just hasn't come to me yet.  Tomorrow my advisor gets back, at which time I'm expected to have done ultra work.  Right now I'm doing laundry.  Tonight I'm going to the gym again.  I'm finally seeing the slightest results.  My jeans don't quite fit yet, but I'm getting closer.  Now if I'd just stop buying ice cream on a whim...

      Sometimes after a good night's sleep, when nothing went right the night before, everything seems better.  This was not that sleep.  First, the alcohol-ridden sleep was dodgy at best, so I was still groggy when I got up.  Then I realized that I will be alone all day because there are no local boys or best friends to get together with. And my car is less than thrilled with me, so I don't feel like I can really go anywhere.  Of course my laptop is also broken, which gives me another icky feeling in the pit of my stomach.  Not to mention the rice I ate which I thought would make me feel better.  If you would call an icky tummy feeling "hungover", then I am.  Once someone told me that eating greasy foods is the only way to cure a hangover, because the grease counteracts the alcohol.  My usual feeling toward that is "gross".  I cringe at the thought of eating greasy breakfast foods while hungover.  Other people say that you need to drink more alcohol to get a mild buzz back on so you're not hungover.  While this may work for some people, it doesn't even sound like a good idea.  I'll skip that.  I have one friend who swears by going for a run to clear his hangover.  In my mind, he's obviously never had a real hangover because running would lead to vomiting in many cases.  And last, my choice hangover cure is to sit around and eat bad-for-you carbs while drinking whatever you can find that isn't water (water doesn't usually appeal to me in this case).  Since I'm mostly better now and it's a beautiful day, I'd really like to go for a walk ... on the streets of Manhattan ... windowshopping and people watching.  Since I'm not in Manhattan, I'll have to find something else (definitive, aren't I).

      When things go wrong for me, they tend to go horribly, horribly wrong.  So it shouldn't have come as a surprise to me that after I failed that class and didn't pass my portfolio last month that things wouldn't suddenly get better.  I just got back from that birthday/ housewarming party, which was well put together and amusing (except that I spilled my entire bbq on the floor), only to find out that my car is even more broken.  It was making this awful rumble all the way home.  I thought I might die on the backroads.  Similarly, my laptop's screen is still busted.  Nothing in my life works.  It also seems to be standard fare that if something bad happens to me in the relationship department once, it's bound to happen ad nauseum (and (here's the key) without interruption from Other Bad Things That Could Happen) until I've sufficiently Learned My Lesson.  This can be evidenced in the past by boys cheating on me, by boys already having (hidden) girlfriends while dating me, and by boys being general, downright asses.  Tonight, again, that twosome that I mentioned before who was holding hands (the boy of which was my recent crush-interest, although I believe it to be the case that I'm just bored and he's not really right for me anyway) was being ... for lack of better words ... cuddly. This has happened to me last fall, where a boy I thought may be interested in me turned out to be just the opposite -- interested in Her.  Of course, these are usually boys that weren't first on the list but got bumped up for lack of better boys. Anyway, no longer is he on The List.  In fact, The List is empty right now.  There are officially No Boys.  And I officially only like gay boys and one taken boy.  The one taken boy is a really good friend of mine, and I would steal him away except that she's my friend, and they're super cute together.  So now I need to find more boys, that I don't work with, and who are polar opposites of the nerdy type I know now.  Good luck to me!

       Sometimes I aspire to be an artiste', and not just an artiste', but a food artiste'!  I love to bake things, I love to cook things, and I love to feed people.  When my birthday came around earlier this year, I baked my own cake because I need the practice.  Though it was yummy, the decorator's icing turned out much less firm than it should have, and the cake looked weird.  Today I finally found a good recipe for decorator's icing.  So I needed a design.  Aron likes pirates (or pirate jokes, anyhow), so I decided on a pirate ship.  I can't say I've ever decorated a nicer cake.  I took pictures.  And it says "Happy Birthday Arrrrrr-on". HA!  I just hope everyone else appreciates it as much as I do.  I'm working toward asking my best friend if I can bake her weeding cake when she needs one.  I'm going to start practicing my marzipan next.  Last night we saw an interesting artistic piece that my friend's been documenting.  The people performing the piece definitely had some opinions, political and otherwise, many of which were followed by cries of "Yeah!" and "Right on!" from various, crazy audience members.  After that was over (whew!) we hit the bar.  Now I'm not one to complain, and I rarely get weirded out, but I must have been in the middle of talking vividly about something when I noticed the people I was talking to were holding hands. Wha? When did this start?  Mid-sentence, I forgot what I was talking about and started stuttering.  How am I supposed to keep a train of thought when I'm caught off-guard by things like this? Meanwhile, the boy I think is cute is still oblivious. Stupid boys.

      Remember how I said I was on a mission to "Do Everything Better"?  Well, so far I've failed.  For a few days I maintained my concept, but shortly thereafter I refound my rut.  My apartment is a mess -- bird feathers everywhere.  I haven't even unpacked from the camping trip two weeks ago.  I have laundry everywhere around my apartment, including the main entryway.  The mess, though, isn't evidence in itself of how I've failed to live up to my promise.  The evidence appears when I come home after work or the gym and just lie on the couch for hours.  I watch tv, sometimes I read, but I almost never leave the couch.  Proof of my couch-i-ness can be found in the fact that the backlight on my laptop just died.  (Remember, I've surfed the entire internet, and then know that I, too, would die if I were a backlight that had surfed the entire internet).  Most people would try to analyze why they didn't want to get out of bed or off the couch.  I, on the other hand, think it's due to me just not knowing what to do with myself.  So I'm going to try again.  This weekend I have the opportunity to turn everything around and restart my self-"Do Everything Better" Campaign.  I'm baking a cake tomorrow for a birthday/ housewarming party.  I will instill perfection in the cake.  Tonight I'm going to see some weird-but-artsy one-man-show.  Sunday I'm going to work so that I will have done a good job by the time my advisor gets back into town on Friday.  I'm looking forward to submitting this paper that we're working on, even though my work ethic has been low lately.  And, finally, the part where I complain a little and confess a little.  I've been going to the gym for four weeks now (as of Sunday).  It started off well: I was running and running and doing situps and running and doing pushups and running, etc, for an hour at a time.  In the beginning I was so excited to go and just do it (a la nike) because I anticipated super results.  Unfortuantely, four weeks into my routine, I'm getting a little bored.  I haven't seen the visible results I was hoping for (although I know my expectations were unrealistic).  I have seen that I can run better and do more exercise, but that's not nearly as much of a motivator as looking better.  I'm hoping to lose about 20lbs, all told, but I'm nowhere near having accomplished that.  It may be time to also cut back my diet a little.  You see, I have a problem.  I go to the grocery store, not intending to buy ice cream, and it happens to be buy 1 get 2 free (thanks, Big Y).  I can't resist a deal.  When it's in my freezer, then, it becomes fair game at any time.  A few years ago I had one three month period of unintentional diet where I just happened to eat a turkey sammich for dinner every night.  That worked well.  I should go back to that, but now that I live alone, it's just so easy to sit on the couch with food, gobble, and not feel guilt.  To "Do Everything Better", I'm going to have to quit; I'll start by taking the ice cream to the party tomorrow.

      Today I had jury duty.  When I got to the courthouse (after grumbling about feeding the parking meter) they metal detected us and stuck us in a tiny room.  A tv in the corner was showing bad ABC morning shows, so I should have been grateful when they put on a 20 minute video about "how to be a juror".  But that joke of a movie just made me wonder what our legal system is thinking.  They make it seem like their jurors need some serious hand holding.  I don't want to say I was insulted, but I would have prefered a three minute rundown from the security guy.    After some more sitting around, they took us into the court room where the judge told us the facts of the case (too gruesome to post here, worse than murder) and told us our job.  He also told us that it would be a three week trial or longer with all the witnesses.  I was going to tell them that I would be biased, but I decided for impartiality.  After leaving and re entering the room, and more and more sitting around with crumby magazines, they finally put us all back in the court room.  They selected 14 of their 35 jurors at random, from which I was picked.  But the lawyers got a preemptory strike, and out I went.  It was neat to see the legal process at work, despite all the sitting around in dark rooms, but I'm quite thankful they didn't want me on the jury.  I came home around 2pm, read about Sicily, and napped for a couple hours.  Then around 9pm I decided I wanted sauteed vegetables.  So I filled a pan with a pepper, a summer squash, and garlic and sauteed.  But it turns out I wanted the smell more than I wanted the food.  I wish I had someone to feed (and who would eat the weird things I eat).

      Just 14 hours after I reminisced about INXS in my locker, I found out that none other than INXS is searching for a new lead singer.  On reality-tv, no less.  Good luck finding anyone worthy of the cause, guys.  While I applaud the idea of having a rock-based reality show (instead of the fluffy, Sunny 99.1-type American Idol), they're going to get the biggest losers in the country.  Any person they pick off a reality tv show to vocalize the album is not going to live up to Michael Hutchence.  Rephrase: Any person they pick to vocalize the album is not going to live up to Michael Hutchence.  The "reality tv" part just means the person will be a bigger loser.  If INXS is smart, they know they'll never live up to M.H.'s legacy, and they won't try.  That said, maybe they should start over from scratch.  Unfortunately, I think M.H. was really the brains of the operation (or, at least the good looks and personality of the operation), so there's no hope to be had.    I'm also wondering if women are allowed to audition for (or have any chance of winning) the position.  While I'm all women's rights (woohoo), I don't think this is the situation where I want a woman in the lead position.  I would argue that if they're really going to stick with calling themselves INXS, they should stick with the INXS formula, which is all male, all the time (and Hot Hot Hot).  You know, there really hasn't been a band since INXS that's made me want to hang their picture in my locker (if I had one).  Why is that?

      We had our Ruddigore readthrough tonight.  Everyone's still very nice, although I don't exactly feel like jumping the gun to meet all of them (for various reasons).  We'll have our first rehearsal in September, so now that I have a script I can just sit on it for a couple of months.  I've been tired all day, which was fun in read through when I thought I was going to fall asleep right there.  It was also fun at the gym when I thought I might fall asleep and die on the treadmill.  I guess today wasn't as exciting as I had hoped it would be.  I had a run-in with my advisor this morning and he put me in a bad mood and vice versa.  Then he called me stubborn, which I admittedly am.  But if I can't believe in work I've done (even when it's wrong), then who will ever believe in any of my work?  I think he's wrong, and I will continue to think so because I am stubborn.  I'm waiting for a boy to call me.  I have one in mind.  I don't think he's going to call.  In fact there is no good reason why he  should  call, and even less to suggest that he  would  call.  It's one of those ridiculous crushes (like having a crush on INXS or Axl Rose) where you know he's not thinking about you even though you're all-consumed by him.  Maybe if I were 14, I would have his picture in my locker.  And then some day he would stop by my locker randomly (just like I always expected INXS to do) and find his picture in there.  I would be embarassed, but it would start a beautiful ... something.  Of course, I would be 14, which is both bad and good.  Maybe, even though I'm not 14, I'll see him tomorrow.  And maybe he'll be all the members of INXS who never showed up at my locker.

      Having devoted a couple chapters to my fish, I figured it's time to get back to something more pressing: me.  That's right, I'm egocentric.  I also talk more than anyone I know (which is partly why this blog is a good idea), and oh my god do I talk.  This weekend has been like one massive party for me so far.  Friday we had a birthday party for my friend Kelly.  She's awesome.  We went to this sushi place where they cook the food on a grill in front of you. The chef was flipping eggs and onions everywhere!  He was a mad man!  I had the best sushi Ever, and I found out I love eel.  Unfortunately, when the bill came, we ended up short.  I find that having 17 people to dine is more of a chore than a party.  How much was the bill, you ask?  It was a whopping $466, $150 of which was drinks.  Tip was not included.  So we had to scrounge around for extra dollars, making everyone at the table antsy.  After dinner we went back to Kelly's house for drinkies and to watch the tivo-ed spelling bee.  Those spellers have some craaaazy words... Is that from the French from the Latin from the French?  Sometimes they ask "is that from the Greek word meaning to pummel?"  And also some kid fainted on stage.  wimp.  Around 1am I agreed to help Kelly move into her new house the next morning at 11am, so I decided I should leave.  The next morning Kelly called, I went to the gym, and then we moved her stuff.  I love their new house -- it's totally more homey than any other house around here.  Unfortunately, it's haunted.  There's a little old lady's ghost in there.  We went to The City last night for another birthday party, and I felt bad because we left long before the party really got jumpin' since a few people wanted to go dancing.  Most of those few people didn't even dance.  Anyway, we get to the most touristy, expensive "dancing" district in the city and end up in this bar that I've (luckily) heard only good things about.  Good cover band, not too packed, good drinks.  Then, I'm standing there thinking about how I only get picked up by total geeks in bars when, out of the blue, I get picked up by a total geek.  All he wanted to do was talk about computers and work.  I asked what else he did (for fun, etc), and he just kept talking to me about artificial intelligence and other geeky things.  He was a nice guy, but when he started leaning in, I got a little creeped out.  The only people who are allowed to "lean" are people I currently have a thing for, and he's not one of them.  Anyway, my question is, why do I attract geeks.  I don't look geeky or smell funny.  It's not like a wear a sign that says "I'm a geek".  How do they know?  And if I'm going to attract geeks, why can't it be (a) someone who I have a thing for (b) who's straight. (Dear Oblivious, Get a clue. Love, Allison). I'm not being unreasonable.  While geek was talking to me, my friends decided to switch bars.  I used that as my exit and booked it out of there.  We circled the area for a little while trying to find somewhere to go without a line. We ended up finding what we "wanted" in this skeezy little dive that played grainy rap music.  Some bitch in a pirate-striped shirt made fun of one of my friends, and we almost stepped to her.  The girls there were complete tramps.  Speaking of people we wanted to pick a fight with, one of the girls who came with us turned out to be annoying.  Since cattiness comes so easily to me, Maryanne and I were able to tear her apart from the sidelines.  After leaving there, we went to Steve's house where we stayed the night and had donuts for breakfast.  After a short sleep and a long drive back, I'm getting tired and may need a nap soon.  I talked more this weekend than I have in a while.  It's like I never shut up.  And everything's a non-sequitur.

      Tonight we're having sushi for dinner, little (raw) fish that gave their lives for some wasabi.  It makes me think of Edward Scissorhands (Gabby), the fish that wouldn't die.  I've briefly mentioned Gabby before in the blog, but I thought I might tell Gabby's story today.  It's not too complicated.  Gabby is a betta fish and was about a year old when I got him from the pet store (because betta fishes aren't sold until they're one year or so).  That was two and a half years ago, my first year in grad school.  When I brought Gabby and his little gallon bowl, with rocks and a plant, back to the office, it was a swell time.  Everyone loved tapping on his bowl and asking about him.  He breathes air?  He couldn't possibly!  But this newfound attention got old very quickly.  My answers became a very routine, "yes, he breathes air. yes the bowl is big enough. go away".  I still liked watching Gabby swim in circles and be a calm little fish.  I fed Gabby every day and changed his water every two weeks.  He was happy.  I was happy.  There ends the happiness.  When I went to Baltimore for the summer to work, I had to take Gabby with me.  This wasn't too bad because I still loved having the little guy around.  So I slapped some tinfoil over the top of his bowl, put the seatbelt on him, and away we went.  Around the second week of summer, I had made a whole set of new friends, and we were goofing off together all the time when we weren't at work.  Little Gabby had been living in my windowsill in my bedroom, and one afternoon when I took a look at the bowl to feed him, his water was completely green.  I'm not talking about a little yucky, but it was nasty.   I'm not sure how long it took to get like this, but it couldn't have happened overnight. It was so bad that Gabby was lying on the bottom of the bowl on his side, and he looked like he was about to kick the bucket.  He didn't respond when I tapped him or anything.  Of course, had he died, it would have been a product of my neglect, and I would have felt really, really badly about it.  So, immediately, I changed his water, and almost as quickly, he became lively and swimmy all over again (well, as lively as he ever was).  I vowed to never let this happen again.  The summer ended without further incident, and I returned to school.  Gabby reclaimed his space on my desk along with the attention of all the lab's newcomers.  When winter break came around, I had to find pet-sitters.  A few of the profs in the department passed him around for the two weeks I was gone, and all was well.  When I came back, he was as swimmy as ever, and again he took his space on my desk.  That's when things started getting bad.  At home, I hated my housemate(s).  At school, I hated my work.  I had no purpose. I wanted to leave.  I was one foot out the door.  Gabby started to get neglected, although I still fed and changed his water regularly (when I would come in to work).  Gabby got further neglected as the semester dragged on.  Then when it was time to leave for Baltimore again, I was in a really low, low place.  I winced at the thought of packing.  I winced at the thought of driving.  No summer would ever live up to the last summer.  And I hated my life.  I was set on getting a bird to go with the new life I was planning to start in August.  I winced at the thought of packing up Gabby again to take him to Baltimore, but pack him up, I did.  When I got down to Baltimore, he took a seat on the kitchen table, where my roommates promptly pushed him to the back wall with the salt and pepper shakers.  I didn't like my roommates. I didn't like the salt and pepper shakers.  Gabby got neglected.  I fed him and cleaned him, but rarely looked at him.  I don't know if or what he thinks about, but I know that he gets excited when people come around his bowl and hang around him.  He starts swimming and gets just the slightest bit lively.  We didn't.  By the end of the summer, I had my bird, Reggie, the smartest little creature ever.  Gabby had made his way back to school two weeks ahead of me, and now Reggie and I were moving back.  Work would be better, home would be better, and the future was brighter than it had been in a while.  Unfortunately for Gabby, he was living at my apartment in my kitchen.  Little fishy had to compete with larger and smarter birdie for my attention.  Alas, little fishy did not win, and I did not have the good sense to take him back to work where people might revere him as if he were a god among fish.    Finally, even though I fed and cleaned him regularly, I had almost entirely forgotten about Gabby.  Winter break came around again, and the day before I left, I remembered that I should find him a fish-sitter.  I had less than twenty-four hours to swindle a friend into feeding my fish.  Luckily, my friend Aaron had just gotten two betta fish, one of which had died; I figured he was a good candidate.  I changed Gabby's water, and gave him a call.  Aaron said he would take the fish but make no guarantees.  That was okay with me.  A fish that died in my absence wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing.  I'm a bad fish-owner.  About ten minutes after changing Gabby's water, he was lying on his side at the bottom of the bowl, almost bent in half.  Again, he looked like he was on death's doormat, but this time his water was clean.  I pretended not to notice (bad fish-owner), and took him to Aaron's house.  Aaron said he thought Gabby looked like he was about to die.  I wasn't concerned (bad fish-owner!).  I left for the break, and didn't think about Gabby once.  When I came back, Aaron gave me back Gabby, who had lived, and told me that his own fish had died (or that maybe he had flushed it while it was still alive.  he wasn't sure).  When I tried to offer him Gabby to keep, he said he didn't like fish, anyway.  Great.  So I took the fish to my friend John's office where I was working in January.  And I proceeded to forget about him completely.  Luckily, John is the nicest person in the world, and he took little Gabby in, fed him, and cleaned him.  When I asked John if he wanted Gabby, he said not really, but that he would think about it.  I pressured John.  And pressured him.  Until he took Gabby.  But John wanted to change his name.  "Anything," I thought, "Just get this fish a good home!"  John changed Gabby's name to Edward Scissorhands because "if he had hands, they would most certainly be made of scissors", mean little fish.  When I moved out of the office in February, John and his other officemate gave Gabby the love I hadn't.  Then in May John was leaving.  He couldn't take the fish.  He loved the fish.  He wanted the fish.  He couldn't take the fish.  I had to take the fish back.  Luckily, his successor wants the fish, but she doesn't start until the fall, so I have the fish for three months.  I switch between calling him Edward and Gabby, not that he knows the difference.  He's back in my office, where the new officemates like him.  I've even cleaned him once.  In the past two years he's gotten huge.  Every day I wonder if maybe I'll come in and he'll have died of old age (at this point I can't kill him, I'm sure).  He wasn't supposed to live as long as he has (I know it's the same fish because of a curl at the bottom of his tail).  In my book, he's "just a fish", but I'll try to take care of him at least until I can pass him off to somebody else.

      My advisor's back, so I did actual work today.  But then he decided to change the project up a bit based on some of my recommendations.  I did not recommend we change the project up; I recommended we tweak it, which is totally different than starting over ... again.  So I started over.  Some days I don't think I'm ever going to finish even this project.  Maybe that's partially because when five o'clock came around, I bolted out of there to the gym.  There's this guy at the gym, previously referred to as the guy who checks himself out in the mirror, who I keep trying to make eye contact with for no good reason.  I don't find him that attractive.  I don't really want to talk to him.  I don't really even want to watch him work out.  But the challenge of trying to get Mr. Mirror to make eye contact with me has become way too big to ignore.  I watch him in the mirror waiting to see if he looks my direction, but he never turns his head.  I nod at him in the hall, but he never looks up.  Soon I'm going to throw a dumbell at him to see if he notices.

      My advisor gets back tomorrow, I went to the gym today, I surfed the internet, I wrote some emails, my day wasn't that exciting.  I've started forgetting how many blogs I've written in a day or if I've written any at all.  Turns out I didn't write yesterday about my firefighter experiment even though I thought I did, so here it goes.  Yesterday I monitored the firefighters.  That's it.  Okay, not really.  Yesterday I monitored the firefighters, and they all threw their firejackets on the grass causing my data to skew.  That's it.  Really.  I like the firefighters, and I think watching their drills is super cool, but it takes three hours to watch and an hour of preparation and an hour of download.  Five hours is an awful long time to collect one and a half hours of data.  I'm not complaining -- I do have a pretty cushy job -- but I missed the softball game.  Thankfully (although not for my research), the firefighters aren't drilling in two weeks.  Actually, of note, I'm getting better at the EFX (gazelle) machine.  I haven't fallen off yet, and I can almost comfortably drink water while working out.  My evil neighbor's been gone for a week, but for some reason he returned this evening.  He's been pretty quiet down there tonight, so I wonder if he isn't just trying to escape his (opressive) parents or something.  It's thunderstorming, and Reggie thinks that's pretty neat.  Friday night I'm going to a birthday party around here, and then Saturday I'm going to a birthday party two hours away after helping some other people move.  It's a weekend of birthdays.  Meanwhile, all I can find on the news and in my Time Magazine is stuff about President Reagan's life/funeral.  Now, I know this sounds picky, but dead bodies do not belong in libraries, I don't care whose they are.  Also, it may sound heartless, but I don't feel like all this hullabulloo and mourning is entirely necessary.  He was a great actor, a great president, and a great retired-fellow, but really, the public lost him a few years ago when he had to retreat into privacy because of alzheimers.  I guess we haven't really had a group-celebration yet, though.  Friday is either a federal or state holiday for that celebration/holiday.  Since I'm at a public institution, there are massive debates about whether we get the day off.  Unfortunately, as a graduate student, we don't get these holidays, or any holidays.  Fortunately, as a lazy graduate student, I don't do work anyway.

      Speaking of scary things, the camping group decided to get together again tonight (last night, now) to watch "The Blair Witch Project".  I've seen it three times; the first time I saw it, I thought it was real, and I was crying and scared at the end.  The second time I was a little scared, but more interested in it not being real.  This time, it was, again, scary.  I wouldn't have gone camping if we had watched that first.  The house we watched it at isn't secluded or anything, but it's definitely got some woods around it.  There also aren't any street lamp types in the near vicinity.  I would have been scared to walk to my car (which was through the wooded path) if not for another victim walking with me.  I may never watch that movie again (especially if I have nightmares in the next couple of nights).  If I so much as hear a creak in the floor, I'm calling one of the boys to come save me.  I'm not what I would call a wuss.  I'm usually pretty self sufficient, I don't like to ask for help too much, and I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty.  When it comes to ghosts and things-unknown, though, I'm the most chicken and helpless person I know.  Anything supernatural or remotely not-alive scares the bejeebers out of me and leaves me shakey.  I can't listen to ghost stories without absolutely freaking out (no matter how goofy they are in daylight).  I still believe in the you-know-who in the mirror thing; I try to not even think her name.  I check under my bed and in my closet before I go to sleep at night, and sometimes I even sleep with the lights on ... just in case.  I don't know what I'd do if I were to encounter a ghostie or ghoulie, but it would probably involve screaming and arm flailing, since that's what I do in almost any situation where something unknown crosses my path unexpectedly.  I hope that sleeping tonight isn't a problem -- maybe I'll leave the lights on.

      I just got back from camping, and wow.  It was the most muscle-taxing experience I've ever had.  I'm still a little out of shape, so I had a harder time than a lot of people with it, but I'm also just not used to hiking, so all the climbing we did was a mess for me.  Our cabin was a mile up on a blue ski trail, and to get there we climbed up the trail.  I don't know many people who've climbed up a blue ski trail, but it's like climbing a wall.  It's very, very steep, especially when you have bags and sleeping bags to carry up.  But eventually, and with some help from the stronger folks, we got to the top.  After the fatigue from the hike up the wall had somewhat worn off, we explored a little more around our cabin and then started a fire.  We cooked dinner, chili, and sat around for a while chilling out (and maximally supporting deet).  Then we went on another walk to "find water" in a creek about a mile away, downhill (but not as far or steep downhill as the ski slope went).  After filtering the water, it got carried back (not by me) and we ate s'mores.  Then we told ghost stories and sat around until bedtime at 10pm, when we got out the gas lantern and the 2inch mattresses from the "upstairs" attic and lined them up to go to sleep.  I didn't sleep much or at all before daylight, since it wasn't that comfortable, and it was a little frightening after our spooky stories.  Using the outhouse around 3am was a little spooky as well.  I thought I would get eaten by wolves or bears.  When we woke up, we ate breakfast and tumbled down the ski slope to our cars around noon.  We got to our hiking location around 1pm, and hiked 4.5 miles uphill to the summit of this huge mountain.  It was extra steep, and very slippery in some spots.  I'm not a huge fan of hiking if this is it.  All uphill, and you have to watch your feet the whole time, instead of enjoying nature.  Anyway, we were about 0.3 miles from the summit when one other person decided to sit out, so I did, too since my knees were hurting so much.  It turns out the summit wasn't that exciting, anyway.  We started back down a different trail to our cars before the rest of the group came back.  There was one point where I was afraid we were on the wrong path and going instead into a valley where we would have to climb back up to get out.  Luckily we found our cars, and more mosquitos.    Barely able to control my legs' motion anymore, I'm home on my couch, not dead like I thought I'd be by now.  Some of those slippery rocks, steep climbs, and mosquitos made me want to forego any upcoming hiking trips, but overall I had a fun weekend.  I really enjoyed my friends' company, and I got to know a few people better.  Knowing, though, how much I talk, I hope I didn't talk too much for them.  I don't want them to be like "she never shuts up", but I also don't like to sit around in silence when there are so many interesting stories to hear people tell (or, in my case, that I like to tell -- I would love to listen to other people's stories, if they'd ever just tell them!).

      Work ethic has fallen drastically in last two days.  My laundry's in the dryer, it's sunny outside, and I'm about to read my Fodor's travel guides.  We have a double header tonight at 7pm, which means it won't end until very late.  Then I have to get a good night's sleep for camping tomorrow night, since I know I won't sleep at all on the trip.  I also have to pack for the trip, and make sure I don't leave anything out -- especially the bug spray.  The last thing I want is lyme disease!    Have I mentioned that Harry Potter is 850 pages?  It's a little ridiculous I think.  Never have I read a wordier book.  I fell asleep reading it last night at 10:30 and slept until 9am today.  I've been sleeping a lot lately.  Reggie's been talking to himself quite a bit lately, too.  It's really funny to be reading or watching tv and have an unintelligible conversation going on in the background.  Last night I had another dream about living with the Evil One.  This time, though, I was moving out.  But I had two or more rooms of things to move and no one to help me move them.  I didn't wake up too stressed out, at least.

       I found the library today.  It's in an old house-looking building, and it's got that old book smell to it.  I always get excited the first time I go to a library after a long lapse in librarying.  It's like free books at my beck and call!  I like free things so much that I go a little crazy and try to check out everything they have.  Luckily, this time I was on a mission:  The most recent Harry Potter book.  This didn't stop me, however, from checking out three Fodor's guides, one each to Italy, Spain, and Greece.  Free books!  I have 21 days to skim them all.  I almost checked out a "Learn Italian" guide, but I figured that was overkill for my first library trip.

      Last night I watched the series premiere of "Summerland" on the WB.  I've never met a series premiere that I haven't liked, and this one was no different.  However, you can tell that they're going to use up all the big crowd-drawing stories in the first few episodes.  The kids are going to get high, go on illicit dates, drink alcohol, and get knocked up all in season one.  This means there might not be much room for a second season, but who cares.  Having seen only one episode, I'd give the entire series two out of four stars: watchable, but nothing to plan my schedule around.  I normally mute the tv when commercials come on.  There's no reason to watch them, and they're all the same.  During one of the commercials last night, the tv muted, I heard a knock on one of my neighbor's doors.  People just pound at the doors, so other people's knocks are usually somewhat audible in a quiet apartment.  I usually ignore them.  But the minute I heard a new voice in the hall, I jumped off the couch, ran toward the door, and watched through the eyehole.  I am now officially "that nosy neighbor".  The new guy across the hall is blonde and seems nice.  That's about all I gathered from my espionage.  Then when I was talking to my mom later, relaying the story, she asked, "Is he cute? Did you say he's cute?!". She was very enthusiastic.  Thanks, mom.   My advisor left on vacation today for a week and a half.  This instills work ethic in me in big ways, as you can imagine.  Today I'll probably go to the gym around 3 and sit around the rest of the day.  I went to another mechanic today.  These guys had more tattoos than the previous ones, so I trusted them more with my car.  They came up with almost the same diagnosis as yesterday's mechanics, which pleased me.  Unfortunately, they either don't love motorcycles enough, or the fact that they're part of a big chain means an inflated cost.  So I'll be taking it back to the first mechanics from yesterday.  Exhaust pipes are not cheap, and salt and sand and ice have left mine in a rusty, rattle-y heap.  I was thinking I should just go on ebay and buy a new used Corvair, a la Josh.  Then I thought of the cost of upkeep of one of those and changed my mind.  I would need my own, personal, tattooed, motorcycle-loving mechanic at my whim.

      Today I wandered into my advisor's office to meet with him as we had suggested we do.  As usual, he didn't look up from his computer as I walked in.  Not like usual, there was a woman sitting on his couch.  She had straight brunette hair, a laptop in her lap, and was of slim build.  I took one look at her and then thought, "Oh, Samantha's here for the day."  Samantha is an adjunct professor who works with our group.  I've only met her twice, each time for about an hour.  She's nice, but with my horrible memory for faces, I'd be unlikely to recognize her unless she looked exactly the same as when I met her.  Samantha, from what I recall, is of slender build and has brunette hair, but it's curly.  In this case I was using context clues: a brunette woman in Mark's office with a laptop.  Anyway, I walk in and glance over, not really sure who I'm looking at. Is it Samantha?  Isn't it?  Why does this person have straight hair?  Is this Samantha?  No, it can't be!  Wait, it is!  Who is this person??   Of course, as a person who can't recognize Anyone, I go through this internal conflict a lot.  Since I didn't want to be rude to Samantha (if it was her), I said hi and asked how it was goin' as if we knew each other (did we??).  She said alright, but it seemed a little wary.  Now I'm second guessing myself.  Would Samantha be wary?  Was it really wary, or am I imagining that?  If it wasn't Samantha, I had just confused a stranger.  My advisor said nothing and continued to ignore me/us.  So I tried again.  This time with feeling...    Since Samantha's moving into an office with us for two months this summer, I thought I would casually inquire about that.  "When are you moving in with us?" I asked.  Then the thought occurred to me: this might be my advisor's new-ish girlfriend who I haven't met.  Or is it Samantha?  If it's the girlfriend, I just asked her if she's moving in!  How embarassing.  But she humored me with a pause and another (wary) response, "well, not just yet".  Difficult call.  Maybe it is Samantha.  But maybe not.  Why is her hair straight??  What kind of answer was that?  So I, not knowing if I had dug a hole yet or not, and not thinking, inquired again.  "Who's office are you taking?" I asked, to which the response was, "uh... no one's I think".  This is also a valid Samantha-answer because Samantha is really not getting an office, she's getting a cubicle.  There are no free offices.  But it's also a valid girlfriend response.  Meanwhile my advisor is still ignoring me/us.  And I'm beginning to freak out  So I decide to turn to him to see if he can either change the subject to what I've come up for or introduce me to this stranger if she is one.  No introduction.  My advisor, ever the non-host, wouldn't introduce me even if it were a stranger, so that theory's out.  Still possibly the girlfriend.  He asks me why I'm there, and now I'm so flustered I have no response except "uh... it works, but... it doesn't work".  "What works? What doesn't work?"  WHO IS THIS WOMAN??  I'm completely at a loss trying to even complete a sentence.  Trying not to look back over at the couch.  Finally my other advisor pops on by for no good reason, unknowingly saving the day.  He doesn't seem to think twice about this woman on the couch, which doesn't help either assumption, and I work my way toward the door.  Gotta go.  Catch ya later.  Who is that woman?   Finally out in the hall, I breathed a sigh of relief.  But I'm still dying to know who she was.

      I've been taught to feel like mechanics are trying to rip me off.  The only ones who I believe are not trying to get me to repair an unbroken part are the ones with tattoos.  The more tattoos a mechanic has, the more trustworthy he is.  Then, if I find out he likes to race motorcycles, he's golden.  Today I took my car in to a mechanic in town here.  There are no tattoos at this place, and everyone likes to pretend they know more than you.  When I told the lady at the desk that I had a rattle under the car, she said it was probably my heat shield.  When I told her my heat shield had already been removed, she informed me that there were multiple heat shields.  Unfortunate for her, I know that they've all been removed already by a guy with tattoos who loves motorcycles.  While I waited, I dreamed of getting in fights with the mechanics and the desk clerk.  I imagined them trying to get me to replace my heat shield or get new wheel barings or brakes.  About a half hour later, this twenty-five year old who looks like he has no direction in his life came out to tell me that my exhaust pipe was rusty and rattling and the mid section needed replacing.  How much is this going to cost?  Try $250.  Maybe I've just never gotten used to the fact that cars aren't cheap, and if I have to spend $250/year on my car, it's like beans.  I doubt I'll ever get used to it.  So tomorrow I'm going in for a second opinion to the muffler people.    Another interesting story is that at least three people walked in while I was waiting, sat down, and five minutes later their cars were "done".  The mechanic came out and gave them a clipboard with cash attached (presumably their change).  But why don't these people pay the same way I do -- at the window?  Why do they pay in cash?  Could this be a little under-the-table fix going on?  And how do I get involved?

      We went out tonight to the grad-night.  We didn't see any other graduate students (except Sarah's friend Brad who doesn't count).  But there were about six of us there, so we weren't lonely.  I like everyone I was with, but god am I ever in the market for a local best friend or someone who wants to do things with me first and foremost.  I drove there alone which wasn't so bad, but I felt like everyone else had someone to go home with or to, or someone to laugh about the evening with.  I can't even really gossip with anyone in that group.  Don't get me wrong, I'm wild about my friends, and I wouldn't trade most of them.  But sometimes I just want more -- a best girl-friend, or (I'm realizing now I guess I have to have) a boyfriend (because most girl-friends seem to ditch me when they get a boyfriend).  None of the guys at the ABC were very good looking, or else I might have approached them.  I'm getting to the point where the lonely part of me is winning out over the sensible part of me.  I'm not looking for gorgeous, but a good first-impression kind of look.  Also, my two friends are definitely together, but why are they still keeping it secret?  They weren't there tonight, I just mention it because they were brought up and then blatently  not  discussed.  Bizarro.    So then on the drive home, I was thinking about how there aren't any guys from my past who I would want back (except one who I know is a Bad Choice).  Then I was thinking about this other guy I know who I kissed once and who is a friend of mine (although I hated him when I first met him) and who I wouldn't mind getting together with.  Unfortunately he drinks a lot -- not to the point of alcoholism just to the point of still acting like an undergrad and getting drunk whenever he drinks -- and smokes, but he's very cute and entertaining.  Also unfortunately, I dislike his housemate(s).  I don't know if this makes him out of the question.  I know if I weren't so damned lonely I wouldn't even be looking at people I already know, which probably makes him out of the question.  I wonder if I'll come back to read these blogs someday and laugh that I was so silly, or if I'll still be lonely.  God damned Friday nights.

      Yesterday I went to Saratoga as (un)planned.  I woke up, got dressed, packed my lunch for work, and went to feed Sarah's cat.  After feeding her cat, I decided I couldn't go to work, so I went to Saratoga, instead.  It's a good thing I packed my lunch because food there isn't cheap (or healthy!).  I ended up playing six races at about four to six dollars per race, and at the end of the day, I was six dollars ahead.  Of course, I realize that that doesn't cover the cost of going (I estimate that with gas, tolls, admission, and parking, the day cost me about $40), but then I can mark this day down as my "day of entertainment", and put the cost into that bin.  My coworkers seem to think I have a gambling problem now.  They don't realize, though, that it's really just because this place is dullsville and I have nothing better that I can do alone.  Maybe I should start a horse-racing blog (on how to pick the ponies, not on the stakes of a particular day).  Maybe it would be popular.  I think I'd like being popular.  Anyway, today we had lunch out in town.  It was pretty hot outside.  We got to town when I realized that I had left my bag (with wallet, etc) back at the office.  But since I remembered having taken it to my car, I must have left it in the parking lot.  This turned out to be an accurate assessment because when I went back to get it, it was sitting in the middle of a vast expanse of pavement.  My advisor isn't in today.  He's moving into his new house.  He wouldn't let us help him move (unethical, blahblah), but I think I'm okay with that since it's such a hot day.  In other news, I think I've got the solution to the hard problem I'm working on.  But the solution is hard, so I don't even want to put the prototype together.  ugh.  Tonight we're going to a bar-night for graduate students.  Maybe I'll meet some nice people there  or maybe I'll get bored and go home early.  Either way, I will have gotten out of the house.  Reggie is being pesty lately.  He shrieks whenever I'm not in the room with him.  It's super obnoxious, and moreso because I can't figure out why he does it.  Some of the literature on parrots says that he's doing flock calls because he's scared that I (his flock) have left him.  They also say that I shouldn't get mad at him when he screeches (but it's Really hard not to) because then he gets scared and will screech more.  Imagine having someone (who loves you) yell at you nonstop because they just don't want to be alone.  It gets really irritating really fast  Some of the books say that I should play with him more, and it's true that when I gave him an hour a day he was less screamy, but I've gotten so lazy lately.  And then he gets mad at me and it makes me angry and not want to play with him, so he gets angrier, feeding the cycle.  It's tough to have a bird.  However, if I lived in a house, I wouldn't care if he shrieked, and we'd all be better off.

      Today was a ho-hum day.&nbsp; Until my friend from highschool called and confirmed that she was not coming to visit.&nbsp; Even though she was only an hour away (usually she's 10 hours away) and didn't have any plans for the evening besides driving home.&nbsp; It's a little irritating that she's always very excited to spend time with me unless it involves her expending effort.&nbsp; I know she's been busy taking a hard exam&nbsp;for two days, but I was ready to&nbsp;offer her&nbsp;a short (one&nbsp;night, even, if that's all&nbsp;she had) vacation.&nbsp; Instead, she opted for taking her boyfriend (who she lives with) out to dinner tomorrow night for his birthday (because he wouldn't want to wait an extra day to give  her  something she might want).&nbsp; In similar news, one of my other best friends from highschool is going to be in Massachusetts tomorrow (1.5 hours away), and she sent me an email telling me to come out to visit her.&nbsp; Thanks for the extended notice.&nbsp; I'll probably go, but here's my question:&nbsp; why doesn't anyone consider my feelings when they plan things?  I'm thinking I'll skip work tomorrow so that I can go to Saratoga.&nbsp; Maybe if I spend a day out of the ordinary it will make the ordinary seem less ordinary.&nbsp; Or, I could be completely wrong.

      Reggie has been very, very bad lately.&nbsp; He screams all the time when I'm not in the room, and sometimes even when I  am  in the room.&nbsp; He's a cutie, but, surprisingly, living in a one bedroom apartment with a screaming bird is not my idea of fun  or  relaxing.&nbsp; Today he was being shrieky, so I decided that it was bath time (it's been a while).&nbsp; When I put him in the sink, he got really really pissed off.&nbsp; He's usually mad about baths, but today he was especially indignant.&nbsp; So he bit me, and twice.&nbsp; He bit me last week, which broke the skin because it was time for a beak-filing.&nbsp; But today, he didn't need a beak filing.&nbsp; He just grabbed on and pulled.&nbsp; One is a gash, and the other looks like a scrape.&nbsp; My knuckles were bleeding and bow was I mad.&nbsp; So I took him to the bathroom and put him in the shower.&nbsp; He was still mad, but he calmed down then, and I put him back in his cage.&nbsp; I was crying and my hands were&nbsp;dripping blood all over the shower, and I think he knew he had hurt me.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's been acting a little better since the incident, and when I took him out of his cage, he looked, if birds have these emotions, sorry and embarassed.&nbsp; I have forgiven him, but if he keeps this badness up, I'm going to consider sending him to my parents who have a much larger place than I.&nbsp; I tell you, it's a good thing I don't have kids!&nbsp; I think I'd sell them to the gypsies faster than just about anything.

      Today was a lousy day.  I found out that one of my friends and coworkers has cancer.  He's calm about it, but I think he must be broken up about it on the inside.  He's got a wife and twin two year old girls.  They say he's going to be fine since it's in early stages, but it's still really scary.  He's one of the nicest guys I know, and I mean just really good-all-around.  Nobody dislikes him, and I would bet he doesn't dislike anyone either.  It's really sucky that things like this have to happen to the good people.  You'd think there'd be some reward for being good all the time.  Guess not.  He's also only 24.  Anyway, I'm glad they caught it, but it really made it hard to keep working the rest of the day.  I just kept thinking about how much this sucks for his family and how scary it must be for him.   Depressing day.  And it was rainy.    And then I realized how self-centered one of my other co-workers is.  (I say that because I am self-centered, so I know what it looks like).  He always thinks everyone who comes into the office is coming to talk to him.  So when the majority of people stop at my cube to talk to me about topic X (which they usually show up with already in mind, not wanting to stick around and be generally chatty), he shuffles all the way across the room and listens and adds his two cents.  This wouldn't bother me if it happened seldomly, but it happens All The Time (thrice today).  I just want to have my quiet conversation without him butting in for once.     Tonight I'm staying home to watch tv and eat ice cream.  Tomorrow I have agreed to go see a play that appears as if it's going to knock me over the head with a moral.  Why do people like to be knocked over the head with a moral?  But then again, why are some shows so blatantly obscure as to contain not only no moral, but no real plotline?  Why are musicals the only thing you can count on?  It's a good thing we have musicals!   They make Everything Better

      I watch a lot of&nbsp;tv.&nbsp; It's getting bad so that&nbsp;when I'm not watching tv, I'm thinking about watching tv.&nbsp; I spend a lot of time wondering what's going to happen next on "Las Vegas", "The Casino", or "Summerland".&nbsp; Even though I watch a lot of crappy tv and I therefore&nbsp;know exactly what's going to come next, there's always some plotline that I feel they've missed and some characters that need to be cut.&nbsp; I should be a tv writer.&nbsp; Or I should tell Nielsen a thing or two about which shows to keep and which shows to kick.   Between all my tv watching and tv-thinking, I've been working (which hasn't been terrific or fun, although there's plenty of work to be done, at least)&nbsp;and doing softball practice.&nbsp; While Sunday's softball game was poor, my Tuesday practice proved that I can hit a nice line drive to third.&nbsp; I&nbsp;even gave Jenn a nice bruise.&nbsp; But then I got payback by hitting myself in the nose with a 10lb weight.&nbsp; It left a small bruise, but nothing as ugly as last week's injury!&nbsp; Tomorrow's our first round of the playoffs.&nbsp; I hope we win at least this game.&nbsp; I also hope Reggie stops his early morning noise-routine before I get Really mad.   Friday night we went to a psychology party.&nbsp; Some guy was drunk and spilled red wine down my khaki-colored linen pants.&nbsp; That's never going to come out.&nbsp; I'm angry about it, but I think the hostess would probably be angrier because he broke her wooden/wicker dinnertable chair in the process.&nbsp; We met a lot of nice psychologists, maybe some that I can even go see shows with in the fall.&nbsp; We also met a new grad in our dept who happened to be there.&nbsp; He was pretty nice, and he brought a friend who immediately upon meeting him was showing me his carpal-tunnel surgery scars (ew) and pretty much telling me he was too good to be a computer scientist.&nbsp; He was pretty arrogant.&nbsp; Then later in the party, he started making out with some chick, and my fellow grads and I clustered as we are wont to do.&nbsp; We then had a riveting discussion (thanks to me) about PM Dawn and "Set Adrift on Memory Bliss", which no one could remember the name of.&nbsp; But when Spandau Ballet's "True" came on the cd player, we all turned our head thinking it was the song we were thinking of, even though at the time we didn't know why.  Next week my friend Amy takes the bar exam.&nbsp; She's taking it in NY, an hour away from me, with a friend of hers from law school.&nbsp; I know that&nbsp;she'll be stressed&nbsp;after she takes it, but since she'll be so close, I was hoping she and her friend would stop by for the night.&nbsp; I don't get to see her very often and would really like to have some visitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though it would be such&nbsp;an easy trip,&nbsp;I think she's probably going to wishy-washy out of it (this because she said she probably won't come).

      These posts seem to get more and more depressing.  We didn't seem to get the paper into the Italy conference.  Of course we weren't holding our breath since (a) the acceptance rate is 25% and (b) our paper had pretty bad results.  I was just hoping that someone would have enough faith in our project to give us the benefit of the doubt, since now we can say we've significantly improved our method and results.  The most unfortunate part is not that I'll be missing out on a "free trip" to Italy, but that I  still  don't have a paper published.  If no one's really as psyched about our work as they say (ie. if no one wants to publish it, even at a  workshop ), then I don't know what case I have for continuing on this path.  Meanwhile, my advisor is submitting a career proposal, and he keeps cutting down the section about my work.  I realize that in his proposal, my work might not be as glitzy as some of the other stuff that NSF might want to fund him for, but if he (and others) are going to keep saying that it's such great work and then not using it for things like this, then I just don't know what to do.  I'm starting to think "put your money where your mouth is", but in this case not money, more like "stop  saying  you respect the work, and start  actually  respecting it", if that makes any sense.  Other than that, today sucks.  Yesterday morning was god awful.  Today sucks.  Reggie has gotten it into his head that screaming all the time is a good idea.  It really, really pisses me off, but since we have this language barrier, I'm at a loss for how to stop him.  I almost don't want to go home in the evenings because I don't want to endure the screaming. And I can't walk because my calves still ache from the gym.  Also, my grandmother emailed me practically begging me to have my cousins visit.  I love my cousins, and I would love to see them.  I don't know what has made her think I've become such a bad person who has to be begged to do things.  Granted, I don't write or call much, but that's just the way people are when they're 5000 miles away trying to have their own lives; she just got lucky that she lives near the rest of the family, I think.  I'm sorry I use this blog to bitch so much, but for the last few days I haven't been able to think of anything really good to say.  It's really been a bad six month stretch (I can't think of one thing that's gone terrifically right in six months), and I don't have anyone who  really  understands, which is, I guess, why I started the blog in the first place.  Stay tuned, because I keep thinking it can't get much worse.

      I, too, have become the victim of the semi-permanent blog-vacation.  After a few days of not writing, I almost entirely forget about blog, and how entirely useful it is.  I haven't really had too much to bitch about in the last few days, so I'll just state the facts: I have a giant bruise on my leg from playing short stop at softball last week (it's about five inches in diameter and dark purple on my calf).  Mark's finger is healing quite nicely (I saw a picture, eww).  On Friday I find out if we made it into the Italy conference (crossing fingers, but not counting on it).  I have to go to the library tomorrow to return the books that I haven't opened since I renewed them three weeks ago.  My laundry is begging to be done.  My research is spiralling toward doom (or at least not showing the steady improvement it once was).  One of my highschool friends found me online and emailed; unfortunately, I can't email her back at that address and I don't have any other.    Maybe to solve all these problems (and more!) I'll stop and get a free Frappucino tomorrow.  I have a gift certificate that I got three years ago that's been sitting in my wallet ever since.  The countless times that I've been to Starbucks I forget to use it.  I usually remember right as the cashier is handing me my change.  Meanwhile, I also have a $15 gift certificate to Starbucks from 1994 (a birthday gift) that I recently found and that no Starbucks will accept any more.  The old gc is handwritten, so it's somewhat understandable that they don't believe that their Stellar Corporation would ever do something as old-school as THAT.  Hell, the employees probably don't believe SB existed in 1994.  Of course, after I try to use the $15 gc and fail, I completely forget about the $3 gc.

      Well, it's Thursday ... again ... and the day has gone almost swimmingly.  Mostly because I haven't done much yet.  Mark seems to feel better about his finger.  I feel better about my project.  And the world feels better about me.  I need new windshield wipers (badly), otherwise I would have gone to the casino today.  It was raining, and I didn't want to go in all that rain for a long drive.  Maybe I'll go tomorrow.  Meanwhile I got rejected for a conference grant.  This past six months has been filled with more rejection than I've gotten in my entire life before.  I'm starting to feel like a failure.  I'm also starting to think (again) that this job just isn't for me.  Anyway, it turns out that I'm going to need publications under my belt in order to start getting travel grants.   I'm just not "qualified" enough.  I'm never going to be qualified enough.  And when December comes around, if I am once again rejected, that may be the end of this.  Excellent.  Some days I think I'm just biding my time until they send me away.  Other days I think I'm pushing them to see how far I can go before they send me away.  Either way, I'm looking to be sent away, apparently.  Until then I'll keep biding my time.

      Today I did quite a bit of writing and work. I played softball, got pegged in the leg again (another gigantic bruise to make up for the last one having almost healed), put a cold beer on it, didn't go to the gym, did a little more work, found out Saratoga's not open yet (boo!), and at the end of it all, I can't get Mark's latest story out of my head.  This weekend Mark went water skiing on the Hudson.  He left home in one piece.  He returned missing the tip of his middle finger down to the first knuckle.  I've never met anyone who's lost much of their finger, although I know it's not uncommon.  It's just kind of weird to think that for 29 years Mark learned to do things one way, and now he's going to have to change everything.  Granted, it's not like losing an arm, leg, or even anything huge, but there are plenty of little things he's going ot have to change up.  For example, he's going to have to start typing differently.  If I were to lose part of a left finger I'd be up a creek for playing my french horn.  Just little things we take for granted every day.  I'm also kinda concerned that when he gets the cast/bandages off, I'm not going to be able to stop staring.  It's also weird to think that a part of him that he can't self-heal is in the Hudson river.

      The 4th of July didn't suck like I expected it to.  I had a few people over and we had bbq and played games.  They're not people I know very well, but it was enjoyable all the same.  The problem with having people over is how much it ends up costing.  To have four people over yesterday, it ended up costing $30.  To have six or seven people over, it usually costs about the same, maybe closer to $40, probably because I don't try to feed dinner and drinks to six or seven people, just chips and drinks.  It may not seem like a lot of money, but to have people over once a month, it ends up costing about $400/year.  I guess my problem is that I always try to be a good host, who doesn't make her guests bring their own stuff.  I know I could ask people to bring things, like a drink or snack to share, but then people are less inclined to come -- they'd rather go somewhere else, and then I'm sad because I get left alone with the one person who wanted to come, who is usually not my favorite.  Today it's raining, and not just raining, it's thundering louder than I have ever ever heard.  I guess it's par for the course today.  I sent an email to ten people suggesting that we go to Saratoga Race Park in two weeks.  I figure a few people will want to go with me, maybe, and even if they don't, this is somewhere I can go alone.  Anyway, after sending the email, one person replied, well, accidentily reply-all-ed, saying that she wouldn't go if so-and-so was there.  Well, so-and-so got the email, and has so far ignored it, but it inflamed certain other people on the email, and now there are hate mails going around.  The girl who initially sent the mean email has a propensity for burning bridges, and we all know she's mostly a bitch, but it's tough to hate her until she's done something mean to you, personally.  A lot of people hate her, I just haven't yet had the fortune.  I also really don't want to get stuck in the middle of this little war.  And I don't want my trip to Saratoga to be tainted by this crumby behaviour.  It's certainly made me rethink my future invite lists.

      Today Marlon Brando died.  It made me sad in a way, even though I've never even met him.  It's always strange when celebrities die because they've given you so much that you feel like you know them.  One analogy for this feeling is the same one you feel when you're working in the theatre and you fall for an actor -- it's usually, I've found, because you've fallen for their character or the way they work with the character or just the show in general, but not because you know them.  Anyway, it makes me think of "Guys and Dolls" when I think of Marlon Brando, and not as much "The Godfather".  He was just so eye-catching in "Guys and Dolls" -- the kind of man you'd want to come along and teach you something about yourself that you didn't know before.  I was just thinking last week how much he (and actually, a combination of him and Peter Gallagher) made me want to marry Sky Masterson.  Actually, I think I'll miss Sky Masterson more than Marlon Brando.  This weekend was going to be another weekend of sitting around.  I got sad and mopey just thinking about it.  So I got off my ass and invited some people over for a bbq.  Then I realized that since the bbq is public property, it may not be free on the 4th.   Well, good luck to me, anyway.  I definitely need to do something that involves other people.  I just talked to my friends Amy and Lindsday online, and they seem to be doing well, except that Amy's having trouble with her boyfriend and Lindsay is only sort of dating the boy I was rooting for.  I like Amy's boyfriend for the most part.  I probably wouldn't date him, but I'm not dating him, so as long as she's happy, I'm happy.  Lindsay, on the other hand, would be a great military wife, which is part of the reason I'm rooting for military-boy.  They asked if they could find my blog.  I wished them luck.  I don't care if my friends read my blog; I'm just not going to point them to it.  Today we pushed off my publication by another couple of months.  It could be ready by Tuesday (the deadline), but it wouldn't be in top form.  I clearly take after one of my advisors more than the other, in that I am a very last-minute-good-enough-for-now type of person.  I also would very much like to have a feeling of completion about some of this work.  This is even beside the fact that I want to have a publication for next time I come around for portfolio review.  It's a little ridiculous that I've been here so long and have nothing out the door yet.  There's some point at which I'm sure I'm going to snap because nothing is Ever going to come through for me.  Until then, at least I have you, blogger (and you, too, gmail).

      Still no computer of my own, and I'm working toward a deadline next Tuesday (I'm kinda screwed right now), so I'm not writing much recently.  I ran two miles yesterday at 6 mph (a little less than 1/3 of a 10k, which is what my friend wants me to shoot for), which was kind of exciting, although it left me sore today.  Funny that I haven't really been sore from the gym lately.  I wonder if that means it's not working.  Tomorrow I'm supposed to have a softball game, but I think I may have to stay at work instead.  Again, kinda screwed.  Besides being kinda screwed, I have nothing else to report or note, so I'm going to go back to stewing in my screw-ed-ness now.  Score.

      Though I was torn up about skipping the tent-erection party in New Hampshire on Saturday, I realized today that it was for the best.  After seeing the group of people who attended the camp-out, I decided that I was entirely luckly for not having gone.  While I had lots of fun with those folks in college (some of them, at least) I do not want to relive moments with a number of them.  I also figure that I would be known as "that girl who hung out with us some in college" since while most of them knew me, only a couple knew me well.  Just looking at the pictures made me feel awkward, like I had been there.  Knowing that things didn't go according to plan on the tent setup is a familiar feeling, too.  I know exactly how the whole thing went down, as if I had been there.  Those guys are unpredictable in a predictable sort of way;  I do miss them.  I hope I get invited up there for a smaller gathering.  I could handle that.  Meanwhile, today I had a meeting with my advisor, my synthesis advisor, and another student.  The other student basically took the research I had done, applied a different technique, and decided this is what he wants to research.  I really got my feet stepped on -- I've been doing this work for 9 months, and he's taken everything it took me 9 months to learn and turned it into his own.  So I told my advisor that I wasn't happy with this.  Of course, he's not thrilled with it, either, but we're going to, for the short term at least, try to make the best of it.  This means working "together" with the other student, who thinks he's god's gift to everything.  It also means that I get stuck with the evaluation end of the work, which doesn't get nearly as much credit as the protocol end.  I don't know how well I'm going to handle this.

      Today we hiked.  We climbed Mt. Monadnock.  It was much higher than I expected, and now I am quite sore.  I may never hike again.  It seems that when hiking all one can really do is look at ones feet for correct placement.  I could not see the forest for the trees('s sticking-up roots).  When we finally got to the top, it looked like the view from the top of the other mountain we climbed (I guess I'm really not one for nature).  I wasn't terribly psyched.  I guess I was somewhat psyched that I made it down alive (I was terribly afraid of falling down the mountain) and that I didn't have to go to the gym today.  It just seems that somewhere I've missed the point of hiking, and unless that point smacks me in the head, I'll probably sit the rest out.  Then tonight we played Trivial Pursuit, and my team lost.  That's okay -- we're all winners (ha)! Afterward I had to come home alone again, but I've realized the drive back, on this curvy road in the dark, is worth the drive at 45 mph.  It's a pitch black roller coaster.  I've also realized that boys are foobar!  Who needs 'em! (Although some of me wished I had been in NH today building a tent.  Last night I saw "The Village" at the theater, and I have never laughed so hard at a movie I wasn't supposed to laugh at before.  I just can't believe that made it past the MPAA as an acceptable film (were they actually to dictate such things).  It was so bad I can't even explain where it was laughable, except I'm sure I would laugh again.  And it makes me wonder what the rest of America is thinking by buying into his films.  Anyway, I tried to stifle my laughter, so it sounded like a squeaking, dying animal who couldn't breathe.  Then I tried to pretend that maybe I was crying, but that emotion also seemed inappropriate. It reminded me of the time when I went to hear Handel's "Messiah" in Hartford and just started laughing because they were singing "For we are sheep, and we have been led astray".  It was funny in a strange, different way ("ha! are they singing about Sheep??; meanwhile Rich laughed "Ha!  They're singing about Banshees!") and I was laughing so hard I was tearing up and shaking the seats, which are somewhat attached.  So rather than bother the woman next to me, I pretended to be so moved that I was crying.  She handed me a tissue.  I was embarassed.

      While this past seven days certainly hasn't been productive work-wise, I've gotten quite a bit of learning in.  I've been doing a lot of reading on Italy, having resubmitted an application for a travel grant to the Sicily conference.  While reading about Italy, I got into the photo-viewing aspect of it all (think Google).  I think it's probably hard for anyone who's ever been abroad to imagine, but since I've never been overseas, I really have no idea what it must be like over there.  For all I know, the trees are all purple and pink all year round, and the bushes grow gumdrops.  Though I don't believe this to be the case, I can't say for sure.  I learned a few interesting things that absolutely fascinate me, although they weren't necessarily shocking.  Among them: one should photocopy one's passport, one should wear a moneybelt (for which I had to look up the definition), traveler's cheques are a good idea but not accepted everywhere, girls wear mostly skirts in Europe.  When I finally get to Europe, I imagine I'll be overwhelmed and not know what to do with myself.  I'm ridiculously afraid of getting lost, never finding my way home, and never seeing my family again.  Sarah's going to Japan in the fall, to Sendai, and I was curious what this place was, so I looked it up, as well.  It's a small city, pop 1million, with some pretty places, but not a lot going on as far as I could tell.  Her conference would be better held in Tokyo or the like for foreign tourists such as herself.  This browsing led me to view more pictures of Italy, followed by pictures of China, Russia, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and France, among others.  Most of these were on a website made by a student at Union College.  So I (easily) deduced his name and found him on Friendster (the world is shrinking for the internet-saavy).  I messaged him, and quickly got a response. He basically called me a stalker and then politely answered all of my travel questions.  It was a nice response, except that I don't really understand why he didn't leave it open to further dialogue.  Is my profile really that frightening?  Am I that scary looking?  Does he honestly think I'm going to stalk him?  I just wanted someone new to discuss travel with, and since he had pretty pictures... C'est la vie! (that's something else I have to do -- learn Italian! -- I REALLY hope I get this grant).  Other than Italy (which has vastly occupied my life lately), Kim had a birthday party Monday.  It was more fun than expected.  We were at ABC (I ended up there four times in a week) and four-six of my favorite people were there.  The following night we (tried to) ABC because we won the League Softball Championship (for the first time in at least four years) [ended up at Rafters].  It was a pretty kickass game, if I do say so.  We beat the undefeated Spare Parts 10-8, quite nerve-wrackingly.  I played catcher very nicely, but my batting was subpar.  Next season I plan to improve even more dramatically than this season, if that's possible.  Sunday night we had our second and final going away party for Sarah and Evan.  It went swimmingly, I thought, and a few of us stayed up late drinking and playing video games, noting how most of our friends don't drink at all and then just go home early (to each his own).  Good friends, good fun.  Finally, I received an email from an old friend in Boston last week.  He's erecting a military tent on his property in New Hampshire this weekend and invited most of his friends to help (the email was a good laugh -- erection party).  I'm sure it would have been fun had I found someone interested in going, but it's a 3.5 hour drive from here, which is rough for me for a one night trip (plus these are people I haven't seen in forever, and I fear their awkwardness before a few beers). (as an aside, I was reading (stalking?) another old friend's blog earlier, and I found out he's going to study in Cambridge at Oxford.  I can't believe how smart and motivated most of my friends are.  It's horrifyingly impressive).  Anyway, one of these days my friend with the place in NH will invite me up to visit, maybe among a smaller group of people, and I won't have to deal with the awkwardness, erect a tent, or have no plumbing.  I look forward to that day.  He's such a sweetheart, and he's someone I really would like to spend infinite time with.  He's crazy, adventurous, and spaztic and has more life than anyone I've ever met.  Why can't I have [someone like] him around here?

      So much of life is being in the right place at the right time.  Of course, this is probably a famous saying, but it occurred to me just now.  I saw the "Bourne Supremacy" tonight (3/4 stars), and was quietly reflecting on how hot Matt Damon is (and what an excellent actor/writer he is), when I decided to find out if he had a girlfriend.  Of course, he does.  He met her in Miami when she was bartending, then they emailed for four months and met again in Prague while he was filming.  This may not sound like much of a story, but can you just imagine being in her shoes?  How lucky was she to have been working that night?  She probably went to her shift saying "bleh. work." and then left her shift saying "wtf?? awesome!"  I'd like to be in her shoes for a couple of days (or, rather, I'd like Matt Damon to be in my apartment for a couple of days).  I used to be pretty good at being in the Right Place at the Right Time.  I say this because I met a few of my best friends by accident or unexpectedly.  (Here, unexpectedly means that they neither worked nor played where I normally worked and played).  Recently, though, "the place" is my apartment and I'm just waiting for "the time" to come around (eg. knock on door, Damon on other side).  Maybe I need to put myself in places that aren't my apartment.  Maybe they'll be "right".  Then again, there's always the "right place, wrong time" thing.  Can't get around that.  But is there such thing as "wrong place, right time"?
