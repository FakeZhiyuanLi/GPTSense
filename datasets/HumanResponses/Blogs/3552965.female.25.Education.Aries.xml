      God, there have been so many retro Allen family moments today it's untrue.  I came home after making a brief fact-finding mission to Great Yarmouth District Library to look up info on how to write the perfect C.V (or at least one that will allow me to make it to the interview stage) only to witness the familiar site of my dearest father, completely off his face trying to cook tea.  Considering his level of intoxication (pretty high but not off the Captain Josh scale) he didn't make such a bad job of frying sausages and mashing potatoes.  No-one was maimed or injured (at least not this time) and the fire alarm didn't go off once.  Perhaps that's because Mum took the battery out but let's just overlook that minor detail shall we?  Sylvia finally got in contact with the parents last night which is good as it has earned me a significant amount of Big Sister brownie points: Dad assumes that the impetus for Sylv to get back in touch came from me which is not entirely true.  I always think the best policy is for me not to nag at her to 'do the right thing' (whatever that is) and in fairness I can completely understand why she felt/feels resentful towards them.  I think Sylvia wanted to go to university but couldn't hack living here while she did her A-levels and thus came to the logical conclusion that getting a job would be the quickest way for her to get her independence.  And Sylvia is highly motivated by cashola, which is why she is fast climbing the corporate ladder and I am languishing in the family home trying to work out what direction to go in.  Today I tried to break the back of my second graduate application.  This time I'm going for a publishing job at Oxford University Press in their EFL department.  I've never been all that interested in publishing before (don't worry guys, I didn't put that on the application form) but I have always had a slightly geeky obsession with English Language coursebooks and I would geninuely like to get involved with producing them.  Anyway, I spent the best part of the afternoon banging out a covering letter.  I'm worried that if I'm not careful I'll come across as a bit of a brain on a stick, as the 'extra-curricular activities' that I need to beef up my experience and make me seem like a more well-rounded human being consist of having written two articles for Varsity and sitting in on English Faculty meetings as student rep.  Hardly impressive.  I also need to avoid repeating the words 'teaching', 'effective' and 'materials' if Oxford University Press are truly to believe that I have a 'keen I four detail'.  That's a joke.  Go on laugh, it'll add years onto your life expectancy.   So what did I spend all my time at university doing?  Down the pub?  No, sadly not.  Leading an exciting double life?  No, wasn't that either.  My 'extra-curricular activity', I'm sad to say, was Having A Boyfriend.  Until my fateful final year, I allowed having a boyfriend to fill up most of the extra time I had when I wasn't poring over the Collected Works of Lancelot Andrewes, a little known 17th century sermon writer with a peculiar proclivity for punning in the pulpit. Haven't heard of him?  Good for you.  Bet your uni had a student union where the floor had a healthy covering of stale beer and vomit and a selection of highly toxic beverages which could be purchased for a mere one of her Majesty's english pounds.  My friend, you have spent your precious youth profitably.  I salute you!  Ahem.  No, having a boyfriend was seconded only by my other major extra-curricular activity, moaning.  Moaning, whingeing, whining, ranting, complaining, navel gazing...  As you can see, this pastime took on multitudinous forms and why, with the right combination of Co-Op Lemon Cake, hot beverages and good company a decent session could quite easily last the entire afternoon.  Christ, why did I waste so much time complaining about how much sodding work I had to do rather than just getting on with it?!?  Perhaps I am more French than I would like to admit (if you're reading this Emilie, I'm really sorry...).  'Bon, bah, ce n'est pas ma fault, madame, il faut voir a cote, je ne peux rien faire, on dejeune, ce n'est pas evident...'  I HATE THAT FUCKING PHRASE!!!  'Ce n'est pas evident', literally translates as 'It's not obvious' but what it really means is, 'I dunno love, whaddya want me to do about it, I'm a grade A jobsworth and je regrette que I just can't be arsed.'  Phew, that was a bit of a rant, wasn't it?  It seems to come so naturally to me that it might be worth whacking down on the 'Hobbies and Other Interests' section of my C.V after all. Perhaps I've been exaggerating a little, but I do regret not getting involved with more extra curricular activities while I was at uni, particularly journalism.  I don't mean 'journalism' in the grand sense of the term, but I think it would have been good for me to put pen to paper in a non-academic context more often and motivating to see the results in print.  A girl I did English with who shall remain unnamed spent all her time in the first year at Varsity.  She then spent much of the long vac and Michaelmas term setting up a rival student paper because she felt good old Varsity was too tabloid-y.  Now I remember feeling very smug about all this because this certain person was regularly being threatened with being kicked out of Cambridge as she's done so little work while pious little me had spent all this time virtuously digging out obscure journals in the University Library and learning my translation of Gawain and his sodding Green Knight off by heart.  The upshot of all this is that Zoe is now at Harvard while I made myself ill with work-related anxiety and ended up with a 2:2.  Not that I'm being hard on myself.  Oh no.  I'm just sad that I focused on the wrong things and never fully appreciated that there was more to being at university than being a good girl and handing in all my work on time.  Of course we all have regrets in life, I suppose the key thing is to learn from them.  So, I'm writing, right here, right now, for my own little select audience and that's something: more than something, a concrete step in the right direction.

      'Blog'.  It's not a nice word is it?  Sounds a bit like bog or trog, neither of which have particularly pleasant connotations. And there's wog too which is possible even worse.

      Some of his best catchphrases were wheeled out this evening.  On the subject of what I should do with my life, Dad waxed lyrical.  'I dunno sweetheart.' (Dramatic pause exploited to inhale more deeply on his 56th cigarette of the day.) 'I wish I could put an old head on young shoulders...  but I can't.'  You've got to love the old man.  Well, you, dear reader, don't have to obviously, but I do.  'You might think I'm just a daft old man.  I'm not computer literate.  I'm not clever like you.  I don't read The Guardian.'  And with that, he bursts out laughing - the special laugh that sounds somewhere between a long gargle and a giggle.  My dad holds The Guardian in the lowest possible esteem - perhaps even lower than Tony Blair and 'them Pork 'n' Cheeses'.  Can't work it out?  It's rhyming slang for a nationality - and remember, 'we woz robbed...'  (If you really can't work it out, email me and I'll think about putting you out of your misery...  for a price.)  So, back in Yarmouth again.  The journey across the Fens was magnificent: it was late afternoon, the sun was shining and I really appreciated all the greenery, especially after having lived in a city where what was supposedly a park seemed more to resemble a traffic island.  I think there was even a rainbow over Breydon Water but that may just be poetic license (you the public decide.)  I've decided to come home because I'm too just wiped out to do anything else at the moment.   I'm pretty sure that I don't want to do the summer school.  I broached the subject with Mum and Dad this evening and Mum didn't seem too keen but there's been no definite answer given yet so we'll just have to wait and see.   The best thing to do is to sleep on it I'm sure.  So, up the apples and pears for me as I used to say when I was wee...

      Today I went to a street party in Gwydir Street to watch Cath play her set again.  Unfortunately in typical English fashion the heavens decided to open so I was reduced to watching under an umbrella. Cath was just as good as the other night though despite the obstacles and the rest of the audience seemed as impressed as I was. I didn't stay long though as I felt tired, tired, tired again:  I bought a copy of the Guardian and a Caramel bar (couldn't get them in France of course that's my excuse) and fell asleep on the settee around 2pm.  I still feel exhausted but I'm not in a panic about it.  If it is the dreaded post viral fatigue nastiness (and I think it is) I have to stay at home for a couple of months to get better then so be it.  It could be a good opportunity to spend some time with my family and forge stronger ties with them.  I know that the summer school job is likely to completely wipe me out and so perhaps the best thing to do would be to get out of it now rather than go and end up having to leave because I'm just too  exhausted to go on.  I'll talk to Mum about it because I know that she's used to living on her own and I think I should respect her right to have her own space if that's what she wants.  Right, I'm going home to get some sleep as that's all my body seems to want to do at the moment and I think it's pointless to fight it.

      I am a little ashamed to admit that I cried this evening during gongyo.  (Gongyo, trivia fans, is a Japanese word that literally means 'assiduous practice' but is used to refer to the prayers we Buddhist types do twice daily which includes reciting two sections of the Lotus Sutra (in Ancient Chinese but we learn the pronunciation from a tape or from each other) and then chanting lots of Nam Myoho Renge Kyo's.)  Anyway, I was upset because I'd been holding in lots of pent-up anger from earlier today I think and also because these horrible feelings of jealousy and frustration have been getting the better of me. I decided before sitting down at the computer tonight though that this weblog entry wasn't going to be moaney or whingey because I'm sick of hearing myself sound like that.  I'm equally sick of hearing myself being cruelly self-critical though so I'll try my best to be easy on myself.    Hmm, that limits my options a little bit doesn't it?  I had thought about trying to write something funny: no, no tap-dancing cats I'm afraid - something magaziney and daft in style, like 100 Reasons Why I Really Hate Lists or Confessions of a Born Again Buddhist.  Hey, that actually seems like quite a good title.  Amongst my thoughts today I remembered the guy I met when I volunteered at the centre called Lawrence who used to be a drug addict but had managed to get clean and get an MA in Social Work.  He now works helping to manage a treatment centre in Bournemouth I think: an impressive turnaround. I love stories like that: your greatest flaw becomes your greatest asset, that kind of thing. Anyway, I remember old Lawrence brought a bit of refreshing cynicism to the the world of Soka Gakkai, along with a new set of catchphrases, including the wise words, 'Never trust a smiling Buddhist...' and the wry observation, 'Buddhists.  They'll clap for anything.'   I do find it tricky sometimes to believe in what I'm doing and I'm not just talking about my chosen spiritual path either.  It's just another area of my life in which it's easy for me to pick holes and critize and say that I'm not up to scratch.  'Call yourself a Buddhist?  Chanted today have you?  When was the last time you went to a meeting? Enjoy that coronation chicken sandwich did you?'  Fucking 'ell.  I'm sick of that voice.  It's so boring.  Somewhere along the line in my life I managed to create this horrible bully that lives inside my head, picking holes in all my efforts to do anything that I happen to think is worthwhile.   Well it ain't gonna win.  I have to win.  I want to write things.  I want to play the guitar and sing.  I want to do a day job that I find furlfilling - and why shouldn't I?  I feel angry all of a sudden.  My head is empty and I don't know how to finish this off. I know, I'll tell you all about the little movie clips of myself that I've been playing in my head recently. In one of them I'm wielding a big red fire axe and using it to hack my way through a huge wooden door.  That, pop psychology fans, must represent me overcoming my own (imaginary) obstacles and surpassing my limited expectations of myself.  The other one I've been having for around six weeks now.  I'm wearing a posh lace dress with big sleeves standing barefoot on a wooden floor.  I open out my hands to reveal that I had tons and tons of black marbles hidden in my fists; I let them all clatter to the floor and there are streams of them and they make a really satisfying sound.  Not so sure what that means.  Letting go?  Too trite perhaps.  Anyway, I'm boring the pants of myself now, which is what I always do when I want to discourage myself from ever writing anything ever again so I'll leave you now and go home and do more 'magic rapping', as Cath's non-Buddhist boyfriend calls chanting...

      Well for those of you who thought I was in Spain it might surprise you to know that I'm in fact sitting in an internet cafe in Cambridge.  No, I didn't lose my passport or miss my flight (although both of those things would have been par for the course with me).  I decided that I felt too achy and nauseous and sick to travel anywhere and so I'm resting up at my friend Cath's for the next few days.    I managed to pull my finger out today and get a job application finished off.  It's a position that I really, really want: working  for an organisation which provides training for 'the educationally and socially disadvantaged' (i.e refugees and asylum seekers) in North London but I threw a childish strop about it yesterday and almost decided not to bother applying at all, which would be daft.  I read out what I'd managed to get done to my friend Rose on the phone last night and decided that what I'd written wasn't too bad at all.  As far as I can see, it all rests on acroynms - the job description asks for '2 years ESOL experience' which strictly speaking, means teaching refugees whereas my two years of experience is in EFL - English as a Foreign Language - i.e teaching abroad.  I've tried to 'big up' what I've done as much as possible (in my sister's phrase) but I'm not sure if it will be enough to secure me an interview.  However, as I said I'm really pleased that I've managed to overcome my loathsome inertia and get the damn thing sent off.  It's lovely spending time with Cath although it's been a bit difficult for her I think because she's not allowed to speak!  She has to rest her vocal chords after the benefit gig she did on Monday which was *amazing*.  I've only heard the Coombster do whispery folk numbers before so the new sexy soul sista was a revelation.  Her voice was so powerful it sent shivers through me.  I'm really pleased for her as I know how hard she's struggled in the past with both voice problems and that nasty bugbear of creative types, self-confidence. The gig served as a timely reminder to get my own butt in gear as well.  I've agreed to do a 20 minute set at Cath's birthday party (will probably be at the beginning of September) so that I have something concrete to aim for that I cannot allow myself to wriggle out of.

      It's one am and I can't sleep so I decided to do what most insomniacs get up to these days and bugger around on the internet for an hour or so until my eyeballs turn red and I collapse in a fit of exhaustion.  I am now the proud owner of an SGH-E600 mobile phone.  What SGH-E600 stands for is anyone's guess.  However, I can tell you that my new handset is silver and shiny, slides easily into the pocket of my jeans and has a camera-attachment thingy.  Useful for taking drunken pictures down the pub.  Not that I'm allowed to get drunk these days, but no matter.  I'm tired.  My back and shoulders ache.  I've been feeling nauseous and shaky today, especially this afternoon and I'm worried that it might be these tablets that I've had to take for the past two months.  I feel sad.  I actually shed a tear earlier although why is anyone's guess.   I don't want to whinge (you're not whingeing).    I'm jealous of lovers in love.  I'm tired of not getting what I want.  I don't want to moan though. 'No-one likes a whinger...'  as my Nana said to me in a letter once.  She talked a lot about Uncle Alex and how he takes her shopping once a week but he doesn't have much patience for choosing nice apples and how the checkout girls these days just throw your things at you and they don't care what gets squashed or messed up in the process.   I'm being evasive aren't I?  Doesn't matter.  I'm going to bed because I could write more but I'll only end up telling myself that what I've written is rubbish thus reiterating my belief that my thoughts don't matter. Thoughts. Give you a penny for them if you can write them down fast enough.  Laconic.  There's a word I like the sound of.  That's what I'm being too.  The knotty ache in my stomach is getting worse which means that this is not resolving anything which means I'd best go to bed.

      I'm feeling a bit poorly and sorry for myself at the moment which is my excuse for not having posted anything for the past couple of days.  There hasn't been much to report really.  Well, there was the Guitar Teacher incident which was a bit strange...  Like many 17 year olds, I used to dream of playing the guitar like some of my rock god (and goddess) heros, or should I say anti-heros, for this was the age of grunge, which meant unwashed hair and Doc Martens as symbols of authenticity.  Anyway, I did some arm-twisting at home and successfully persuaded my parents to buy me a silver electric guitar to which I added several shiny hearts (I thought it looked cool).  I also went along once a week to Ian's place, for instruction in the playing of said instrument.  I think it is fair to say that I was probably something of a novelty: I suspect the vast majority of the teenagers who went in and out of his studio every week were boys not girls and that Ian wasn't displeased by having a young female to share his ideas on life, the universe and everything once a week. I think that despite my lack of confidence even I couldn't fail to notice that he was attracted to me.  Anyway....(wavy lines go across the screen to indicate a leap-forward in time...)  Cut to June 2004.  I arrive in Yarmouth, having left La Vie Parisienne behind me for good.  Having got completely wasted at my leaving party en France and performed a drunken rendition of various PJ Harvey and Nirvana songs, I decide that perhaps it is time for me to take action in order to learn to play the guitar properly.  Really.  I mean it this time.  My chronic perfectionism shall no longer be allowed to hold sway (That's what writing this wretched blog is about for those of you who are interested).  So, I decided that even though I'll only be staying in Yarmouth for a brief time it would be worth having a guitar lesson with Ian just to get the ball rolling again.  After a week of being glued to the settee (Mum and Dad have Sky TV now) I open the Yellow Pages and give Ian a bell.  Thursday 2pm.  I turn up at Ian's house, the one on the corner opposite the Tudor Takeaway.  I almost fail to recognise him as his long Spinal-Tapesque hairstyle has gone: in fact, he's completely bald apart from a long thin plait which starts at the base of his skull and hangs right down his back.  Ian's having an argument with the mate he's employed to 'do a few odd-jobs' around the house and he decides to get me involved.  'Lisette, you know nothing about painting do you?  Now, would you use gloss paint on concrete?  You wouldn't would you?'  After a couple of minutes of this we go inside.    I'm never one to say no to a cup of tea so when Ian offers me a brew I'm incapable of declining.  We get chatting about a number of different topics: mostly Ian's OU degree in Music and Philosophy but he interrogates me about my life to date, so I talk a bit about Cambridge (he makes fun of me - repeatedly - when I say I got a 2:2) and Paris and Toulouse and I feel as though my life sounds much more jet-set than it actually is.  Ian tells me nothing much has changed: he'd like to move house, find somewhere in a nicer area perhaps with a garden for the kids but he's had to fiddle the books to look as poor as possible for the divorce settlement. Divorce?  'Yeah, Mandy and I split up two years ago. It's all amicable.'  I remember Mandy: she was tall and blonde (Ian's girls take after her) and used to bring cups of tea into the music room during my lessons to make sure that we weren't getting up to any funny business.  Ian doesn't seem to be eaten up by anguish, a worn-out husk of his former self, so I suppose I believe him.    So, by now over an hour has gone past.  'Ian, don't you think we'd better get on with this lesson?' I suggest.  'Aww, do I have to?  It's really hot outside and I'm feeling a bit tired...  I don't think I can be arsed really.  Why don't you book a lesson for tommorrow?'  And so I agree, Ian nips out to the shop across the road and buys Rich Tea biscuits (the Happy Shopper kind), we chat for another hour, (Descartes, Seneca, Buddhism, Ian's childhood dream of becoming a marine biologist, the asylum seekers) I go home.  End of story.  On the way back I decide to walk past the house where I was born (just around the corner from Ian's) and along the seafront.  I have an ice-cream, a small one, no chocolate flake (unusual for me) and walk to the end of the Jetty where a gang of irritating kids are taking it in turns to jump off the end and swim back to shore.  It is sunny but quiet - there are hardly any holidaymakers about - and I still don't know what to make of the Ian incident.  Or non-incident.  Was he thinking about lunging for me across the black leather sofa under the framed poster of Spinal Tap he has hanging over the mantelpiece or did he just like chatting to someone about his opinions on the nature of existence or is the real answer somewhere in-between?  'Do you have that craving for partnership?' he asked me.  Hardly a proposition.  Hmm.

      The topic of asylum seekers came up over dinner tonight and (surprise, surprise), it prompted something of a family row.  'Row' is a bit strong, although there were raised voices and I did try to stay calm and not be the snotty graduate who comes home only to behave in a condescending fashion towards her working class parents.  Mum and Dad both say that they're not racists and neither are the BNP. 'I agree with a lot of their ideas,' Mum remarked, 'It's just that we've left it too late to put them into practice.'  I tried to argue that many of the thousands of asylum seekers in this country are fleeing political persection or economic hardship but this cut little ice with either of my parents who still seem to want to treat these foreigners as scapegoats for the ills of both the town and the country.  'They get preferential treatment: council houses, free mobile phones, even bloody massages!' Dad growled.  It saddens me that Mum and Dad feel this way.  I don't feel angry; I just find it depressing that people close to me can be so narrow-minded and can think that individualism is okay. 'You've got to look out for number one you know Lizzie.  It's dog eat dog in this world.'  But that's how wars start, I want to say and I know that I sound like a wishy-washy Guardian reading liberal and I still think I'm right.  I wish I had more concrete answers.  I know that Yarmouth has changed a lot in the past few years; if the figure that Dad quoted is correct and there are 4,000 refugees being housed in the town, then that would mean the population has increased by 10%.  Hmm.  I resolve to find out more about this.  I refuse to believe that Mum and Dad are right and that asylum seekers are the root cause of all of Britain's current social problems. Hmm. Resolve to find out more about this.

      Dad came home last night which means that I was awoken by a loud bang on the door this morning around 8.30 am.  Just as I was trying to work out what the hell was going on, an hand reached into my bedroom holding a plate with a bacon sandwich on it. 'Make sure you bring the plate down after you've finished,' he growled before he disappearing again. When I finally made it downstairs I asked him where my cup of tea was. 'Don't be so cheeky.'  At least the bacon sarnie has ketchup on it.  I think Dad is a bit confused by my herbal teas; he keeps asking if he needs to put milk in with them and how long to leave the teabag in for.  'Sandbags! We need sandbags! Three of them.' I flippantly asked Dad if we were about to be invaded but no, apparently they're necessary in order to do some kind of cement work on the new garage to make it ready to use.  I feel a bit like an anthropologist at the moment, just sitting quietly at the dining room table, watching the way Mum and Dad interact with each other and trying to see them both through fresh eyes.  I had to open the kitchen window this morning as all the dog hairs in the air made me have a sneezing fit and my eyes were red raw from the smoke. There are few things that irritate me about living here but do we really need to leave the huge pub ashtray on the table while we eat our dinner?  Even if it has been emptied?  I didn't spend much time with the parents today.  I made myself a list of 'Things To Do' (open new bank account, make doctors' appointment, buy adaptor so can plug in french laptop) and got most of them done which I was pleased about as I'm something of a chronic procrastinator and this is a bad habit that I really want to tackle.  I've even bought a book to help me in my quest to lead a more enriched life, called 'There must be more than this: Overcoming Soft Addictions and Seemingly Harmless Time-Wasting Habits'.  Haven't arsed myself to read it yet - it seems like an overly long version of a women's magazine article - but I will.  Or maybe I know which things I need to change and I don't need to read Judith Wright's words of wisdom on the topic in order to change them.  I seem to be blathering, so I'll start a new paragraph...  The most exciting change of the day is that I'm now offically a contact lens wearer again.  I hate wearing glasses, I always have and I always will.  It doesn't matter how many times I'm told that they can be trendy or even sexy.  For me, the wearing of glasses will always remind me of when I was first dragged back to Norfolk at the age of eleven having lived in Bolton for five years.  Thanks to my bad perm and broad Northern accent, my delightful classmates came up with the imaginative nickname of Deirdre Barlow.  No, no-one can convince me that glasses are cool, no matter how many celebrities wear them.  If you try to think of a bespectacled-celeb, what's the first name which springs to mind?  Jarvis Cocker?  Sue Pollard?  I rest my case.    The optician I saw today did not seem deterred by my bespectacledness.  (I'll invent nouns if I want to:  I have an English degree from Cambridge, don't you know) Oh no.  He was certainly over-attentive and attempted to engage me in what I can only assume he thought was flirtatious banter.  'I try to be charming.  I think of myself as being a bit like Ian Douglas in Day of the Jackal.  You might not have seen that film.  It did come out in 1973.'  Indeed.  Imagine this from a fifty year old with a Norfolk accent.  That accent.  Give me Deidre and Ken and Bet and the Rovers Return any day.  Thank god I don't sound like a tractor-driving, carrot-crunching hick.  That'll do for today I think.

      I'm sitting in what used to be my sister's room but is now referred to as 'The Office'. It's It's too full of junk really to be called that but I am partly to blame for this. In the corner opposite the desk are five crates of books stacked up until they reach the ceiling full of books.  My books: a by-product of my university education, along with the graduation photograph which has been framed and mounted in the hallway.  Perhaps my parents would be disappointed to discover that the scroll I'm clutching is not my degree certificate but a plastic tube with a ribbon tied around it.  As for the cap and mortar board (is that what it's called?) that was just for decoration too: unlike at Oxford, the other university with a boatrace and a history, we weren't forced to wear all that formal garb to our finals.  'Finals'. I always thought that word made those exams sound like the Last Judgement, which in a way I suppose they were, but fortunately we were spared the hell-fire.  Today we made it out of Yarmouth.  Mum and I didn't go to Hickling yesterday (she said her back hurt too much and that twenty miles was a long way to drive to have a meal) so I was pleased that we did something that involved venturing a little further afield.  A trip to Norwich meant getting the train and I've always liked travelling on them especially when there aren't too many people around and you can look out of the window and just be with your own thoughts.  I know that I've spent far too much time in the last year day-dreaming, living in memory and imagination rather than reality and so this morning as we passed by Breydon Water I made a conscious decision to enjoy the present moment, despite my ongoing fatigue. Breydon Water did look beautiful too and when I looked out of the window during the journey I noticed trees and cows and the odd windmill and a lovely rosebush at one of the tiny stations that I always feel resentful about stopping at because it seems as though no-one ever gets on or off there. Lingwood.  Brundall.  Brundall Gardens 'Brundall is just a village, why does it need two train stations for God's sake?' the irritated monologue in my head would normally complain. Today though, I enjoyed the journey, more than usual and I made a mental note to myself to stop slagging off Norfolk for the sake of it as it's not all bad.  Some people come here on holiday and they can't all be fools.  I'm on holiday here too: on holiday or perhaps just resting between two points.  Mum and I did ordinary mother and daughter things.  We went to Castle Mall and I bought one new pair of shoes, black flat slingbacks with ballerina toes and one pair of sandals, white leather ones with squishy cork soles.  It was Mum who encouraged me to choose white - 'Go on, live a little'. I ended up buying a belt to match too and now I'm worried that I might look just a little like an Essex girl. 'Don't be daft,' Mum told me, 'You look smart in that'.  We had a cigarette together as soon as we got outside.  I felt like we were fellow conspiritors.  'I'll offer you one this time but I don't want to encourage you,' she told me. I don't know why I've started dabbling with smoking again to be honest.  After all 'SMOKING KILLS!' as the health warnings on the packet kindly points out.  I like having the odd cigarette though and I always have, usually when I'm by myself in one of those reflective moods.  I've been stealing cigarettes from Mum for the past week when she's gone to bed and everything in the house is quiet.  Daft really.    I'm trailing off here, I can feel it, so I'll try and bring things to a close albeit abruptly.  Mum and I had a nice day out shopping today and I feel a lot closer to her than I have for a long time and I'm glad.  There we are: today's summary.  No Booker Prize winning stuff, no double-backed somersaults, just my thoughts.  Maybe someone else will read them, maybe they won't.  I'm glad they're here though.  I'm glad I've made the effort to write it down.

      It's now exactly a week since I first came back from Paris.  I thought living here in this house again after so long would feel stranger than it does but it doesn't really feel alien at all.  I've been getting on well with Mum which is something else that I couldn't really have anticipated.  The closest we've managed to that in the past couple of years is a kind of icy politeness.  I've realised that she's actually quite shy.  Strange when you watch your parents getting older and see their fragility.  I've spent most of the past week asleep or sitting around in the garden.  There's been a fair amount of watching bad TV too while eating choc ices even though it hasn't been all that hot.  I feared that I might be questioning my decision to leave France at this point but so far I've felt not the least inkling of regret.  One thing I have realised though is that I can't face living in another capital city.  I don't like Yarmouth all that much but one good thing about it is that it's very quiet and peaceful despite all the holidaymakers around at this time of year.  What did Jim Davidison say about them again? 'Overweight in flipflops with kids of different races and no class'.  Not all that far from the truth.    I was walking through the Marketplace the other day (on my way to WH Smiths to buy the Guardian - you can't get any broadsheets at our cornershop) and I felt like I was in a sit-com or perhaps I'd unwittingly slipped into a parallel universe. There were loads of elderly tourists on those concrete benches sitting around in vest-tops and shorts eating chips and a guy with a cheapo cassette stereo trying to flog his £2.99 homemade easy-listening by doing kareoke along to the hits of Jim Reeves or Daniel O'Donnell or whatever other sonic horror happened to be blasting out.  Awful.  This town has no sense of irony.  I'm starting to feel a degree of affection for it though, despite myself, perhaps because I know that my stay here is only short-term (short-term inmate, heh, heh, heh).  Anyway, Mum and I are planning to go for Sunday lunch tommorow in a little village near the Broads (David Bowie sang about them you know - listen carefully to the lyrics of 'Life on Mars?') to escape the influx of teenie-boppers who've paid their £12.50 to experience the joys of 'Pop Beach'.  In my youth (which if I may say so, isn't entirely over yet) it was the Radio I roadshow, and although the acts were of a comparable level of mediocrity, at least it was free.  Not that I ever bothered to go, if I remember rightly:  I think by the age of fourteen I'd already started wearing DM's with purple laces, too much black eyeliner and a permantly pained expression.  So, tommorrow at The Greyhound in Hickling I ought to get my first taste of real homemade Yorkshire Puddings in years.  Can't wait.  Must remember to keep taking the anti-inflammatories though (at least the enemas are a thing of the past...)

      Well you'll be glad to hear that I'm in a much chirpier mood than when I sat down and wrote my last entry.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp; currently back in London again staying with Rose and David once more so I'm typing this in their little spare room after having had something of an action packed day.&nbsp; This morning was spent charity shopping in Wimbeldon and I'm pleased to say that I came home with a pair of white/creamy linen trousers from Gap which I'm very pretty chuffed with.&nbsp; I really love buying clothes in charity shops.&nbsp; I always feel so virtuous when I buy things which I know have hardly been worn and would probably have cost me ten times the price had I bought them new.&nbsp; Because the stuff isn't ridiculously expensive it also gives you the chance to experiment and buy daft things that you know will probably only venture out of your wardrobe once or twice before you take them back to Oxfam to be resold.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Anyway, my account of my shopping purchases, fascinating as it may be, &nbsp;is not today's real news.&nbsp; I had another job interview this afternoon at an FE college in North London and - gasp! - do I hear the popping of champagne corks? - I got the job.&nbsp; However (sigh - yes there is indeed as often in life, a catch) although I would be teaching refugees which is the area that I want to get more experience in,&nbsp; they're only offering me two evenings a week albeit at 20 quid an hour.&nbsp; Obviously I've said yes, but it means that I'll have to find other work during the day and if I find a full time teaching job in the south of the city then I may well have to pull out or be forced to hike across London twice a week.&nbsp; My glass is half empty, my glass is half full...&nbsp; I suppose I should just shut up and be pleased - it goes to show that when you get up off your arse and look for work then there's work to be found as the woman got my C.V because I just took a copy of the Yellow Pages for London and cold called all the F.E colleges I thought would run ESOL (English as a Second Language acryonm fans) collecting the email addresses of relevant people, asking for application forms, blah, blah, so my labouring as a researcher is bearing fruit and will continue to do so I hope.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm looking forward to moving to London as the point of moving back to England is to be near my friends again and not to constantly feel like I'm living in an alien (not to mention alientating) place.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't blame the frogs really.&nbsp; It's not their fault they're arseholes, they're just born that way (heh, heh, heh).&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;So, overall, things are looking up and appear to be moving in the right direction.&nbsp; Hurrah.&nbsp; If anyone has any advice to offer on places to live/not to live in Londinium please feel free to aim your pearls of wisdom in my direction...&nbsp;&nbsp; I've now decided that I'll definitely be in the big smoke as from September as will the errant Sylvia who has decided to leave Sunny Sheffield and move in with Dave from Essex.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope the poor boy knows just what's hit him...&nbsp; ;)

      Be warned blog fans, I'm not in the chirpiest of moods today but I feel impelled to write a post anyway as I've managed to get on the Internet dans la bibliotheque and it's pretty quiet so I ought to be able to concentrate enough to bang out some of my thoughts.   Right, first of all, the evil mood.&nbsp; I recognise this feeling.&nbsp; It normally starts first thing in the morning with an aching, sinking feeling in my stomach and it kind of spreads up my chest to my throat which aches a lot too, the way&nbsp;it does&nbsp;when you're forced to swallow down your real feelings.&nbsp; This, The Homecoming fans, is something that I've become an expert at over the years.&nbsp; Now The Feeling isn't just physical.&nbsp; It's accompanied by the continual snipings of my very own internal critic which cunningly chooses a day like this when I'm not feeling on top form to sneak out of his dark hairy hole and have some fun tormenting me.&nbsp; It's paralysing and it's really, really hard to fight back against.&nbsp; When I'm in a mood like this I genuinely believe (or at least part of me does) that I'm a failure, 25 and stuck at home in Yarmouth, what have you been doing with your life, says the Censor, you thought you'd escaped here when you went off to Cambridge, well, what a fat waste of time that proved to be, hasn't got you anywhere has it - might as well accept that you'll be stuck in some boring job you can't stand for the next 20, 30 years, living on your own and twisted up with bitterness about all the things you wished you'd done but never got around to.&nbsp; It's no wonder I feel so tired all the time.   My deep dark secret is of course that secretly, I always did know what I wanted to do with my life and I always have and I've spent the last 8, 9, 10 years ignoring this wish or devising ingenious ways to get out of putting myself to the acid test.&nbsp; No wonder I feel pissed off.&nbsp;&nbsp; I get discouraged so easily.&nbsp; I tried to write yesterday, but what happened is what always happens - I force myself to sit down and write two or three sides of A4 of whatever, anything, ideas, character sketches, anything, just to keep my bloody hand moving - and then I lose my temper with it all, fail to complete anything, fail all round.&nbsp; I know I'm being hard on myself, but sometimes I feel like the gifted kid who never really lived up to her original promise - and before you mention it, no, M.E doesn't count because as far as the Censor is concerned, that wasn't a  real illness,  not something you could see or measure like a broken arm and anyway, if I'd rested more, if I'd been kinder to myself then I would have got better a lot faster so really if you analyse the situation properly I've brought it all on myself.   That, dear readers, is just a quick blast of what I have to listen to inside my head&nbsp;almost every single day.&nbsp; Now I haven't written this on here because I want you all to go 'There, there Lisette, you're being too hard on myself (yes, I know that, but old habits die hard and it's easier said than done to break old patterns of behaviour)' but because, well, this is just the way I feel sometimes.&nbsp; It's like a war inside me.&nbsp; I used to think it was to do with Home and the bad old days before I managed to get away, but now that's all resolved I can't blame it on my family anymore.&nbsp; It's just a bad, bad habit, the way some people bit their nails.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or then again perhaps I'm just&nbsp;on a downer because this is an in-between time - back in England but jobless and away from my friends&nbsp;and&nbsp;undergoing another period of weird inertia. I think it helps to get some of this off my chest although I hate the thought that I might be indulging in navel-gazing and boring the pants of my tolerant mates with whingeing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate the feeling too that I'm going around in circles - Toulouse, Paris and now here - trying to find a place where I can create the circumstances which would allow me to be happy. I don't regret my decision to come back though - not for a micro-second.&nbsp; It's just frustrating that it seems to be taking so long for my new life to get started.  Hmm, do I feel any better now?&nbsp; Not much.&nbsp; At least I'm off to London again next week which ought to perk me up a bit.&nbsp; And who knows, I might get a response from some of the applications I've been beavering away on this week.&nbsp; I have to do something about the attitude I have towards myself though and I don't know what.&nbsp; Enough, for now.

      &nbsp; According to the thrilling editorial in this week’s Great Yarmouth Mercury, this is the winning combination which will soon be drawing back the crowds to what is, if the 6 foot multi-coloured sign that greets passengers arriving by train is to be believed, ‘Britain’s favourite Holiday resort’.&nbsp; The new lottery sponsored Time and Tide museum is apparently set to transform the face of my home town, providing a wholesome, family orientated alternative to the lapdancing club, casinos and endless miles of amusement arcades where most tourists currently spend their time and hard-earned cash. ‘Fat women from Bolton and their skinny husbands with too many tattoos’ - according to Jim Davidison, the town’s main clientele - will no doubt be delighted that Big Y is taking steps to go a bit more upmarket...   Listen to me, cynical as ever.&nbsp; I’m sure the museum is a good thing but I remain sceptical as to whether it will mean Yarmouth will become a ‘heritage resort’.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mum and I will be taking a trip there in a couple of days though to see what all the fuss is about (and to break up the monotony of unemployment) so I’ll be able to give you a detailed report very soon.&nbsp; In the meantime I’m just applying for lots of jobs and hoping that I’m lucky enough to get something soon.&nbsp; I’ve been offered two evening classes by an FE college in North London which is a start I suppose but obviously I’d need to find other work too to survive.&nbsp; Still, I’ve been getting a pretty positive response from my C.V and so I suppose all those years busting my ass in Camland may just be paying off.&nbsp; I’ve littered my covering letters with references to ‘La Sorbonne’ which is hopefully going down a storm too.&nbsp; I’m running out of things to say already so I’ll leave it here for now but I’ll be keeping you all informed of my progress on the job front/thoughts on life, the universe and the Time and Tide...

      It's 9:33 am, earlier than I would normally write a post but I've decided to beat the queues here at Great Yarmouth Library by arriving as soon as the doors open.&nbsp; My cunning plan seems to have paid off&nbsp;because here&nbsp;I am, hooked up to the interweb, tapping away in relative peace. &nbsp; I'm in&nbsp;a better mood today&nbsp;because&nbsp;I've assigned myself with&nbsp;various tasks to do&nbsp;in order to give my day some structure.&nbsp; Tasks include&nbsp;calling FE colleges in London and asking them to send me application forms&nbsp;for any&nbsp;jobs they might have, sending off my C.V to&nbsp;language schools and perusing the Guardian jobs section.&nbsp;&nbsp; All this ought to help keep madness at bay.&nbsp; I'm feeling pretty darn smug already as I managed to get out of bed at 7:15 am, as soon as the alarm went off, rather than ignoring it and drifting back off to sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's coming to something when getting up early is such a novelty it becomes a pleasure. &nbsp; Once I shook off sulk mode yesterday I called Camden Jobtrain for feedback.&nbsp; Apparently I'm 'eminently employable'&nbsp; but I didn't have enough experience teaching refugees (well,  any  experience) and that's something I can easily do something about and so consequently I feel much more optimistic.&nbsp; It proves that decent EFL jobs are out there and that I can get them too.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Right, that's brief but it is early in the morning.&nbsp; I'll add more later, if I haven't been shoved off the computer by the tribe of Italian teenagers sent by Frisby's School of English (I kid you not) to email their Mamas and Papas back home.&nbsp; Thanks for all your encouraging comments, those of you who've left them, they're much appreciated and a welcome side effect of blogging. &nbsp; Oh, while I remember, I've decided not to watch Big Brother anymore.&nbsp; The phrase I've invented to describe it is Chicken Nuggets for the Soul...&nbsp; I'm spending way too much time in front of the TV at the moment and so last night I wrote in my journal for an hour while it was on instead.&nbsp; I think it was when I found myself watching the live coverage and BBLB and the Big Brother forum that I knew it had to come to an end...&nbsp; Wish me luck with getting a life!

      Well unfortunately the internet has decided to stop working at home and I've had just about as much of daytime T.V as I can possibly bear so I've come down to the library to make the most of their free facilities along with the rest of the unemployed in this town.  The lengths I'll go to so that I can keep my friends in the picture...    I have to say that I'm still feeling pretty glum after the interview.  Coming back here has been a real anti-climax and I spent most of the weekend moping around at home and watching TV, neither of which are going to help me get a job.  I tried to write a covering letter today so that I can send out a batch of C.V's to the old language schools in London but predictably enough I didn't get very far.  I spent an hour writing phrases and then crossing them out before they dared to become fully fledged sentences before deciding to have a break for lunch.  After a quick toasted cheese sandwich I went back to my bedroom to stare at my C.V, stare at the 'covering letter', get in a temper and decide to get out of the house for a bit in the hope that I would find some inspiration.  Jesus, I'm making heavy weather of this and I hate myself for it.  At least I've found out that Yarmouth library has copies of the Yellow Pages for London so I'll have all the appropriate names and addresses once I eventually *have* cobbled some kind of cover letter together.  I only have four minutes and seventeen seconds of free internet access left and there's a queue of kids from Frisby's School of English who are eager to leap into my place as soon as I've finished so I suppose I'd best call it an afternoon here.  I'll try and keep morale up and keep you all posted.

      I suppose I should try and create a bit of suspense concerning the outcome of Wednesday's interview, if only to make this a little more entertaining for you, The Reader, whoever you may be.  Can't be arsed I'm afraid.  As this somewhat downbeat introduction has probably already told you, no, I didn't get the job.  Camden Jobtrain sent me a letter which I got this morning when I got back to Yarmouth.  I have mixed feelings about it all.  On the one hand, I'm glad I got the interview, It was the first application I've made since getting back to the UK, I know I gave it my best shot etc, etc.  On the other hand, an angry voice in my head insists, 'Isn't it my turn to have a stroke of luck?'    I'm taking it better than I would have done in the past though and the experience makes me wonder just exactly what it is that I want to do jobwise.  I don't want to work in a language school.  There we are, I said it.  I just don't: most of them are cowboy outfits and (gasp! - another confession on its way...) I think I'm bored with TEFL.  It's all pretty straightforward which is why I liked it so much in the beginning because I found it easy and I knew I could do it.  I want something more than that out of a job though and I want to avoid getting stuck in something I couldn't really give two shits about at all costs.  However, I'm still very apprehensive about going into teaching 'proper': i.e PGCE, etc, etc.  I want to throw a tantrum and shout, 'It's so easy for everyone else - all my other friends have proper careers and do interesting, demanding jobs and I worked hard for my degree and ITS NOT FAIR!'  I just let the toddler within go off and do its thing while the sensible grown-up part works out exactly what I'm going to do next.  I know I want to live in London.  I know I want to do a job I enjoy, that doesn't exhaust me and that has a point.  This is as far as I've got - and I'm not a particularly patient person by nature so let's hope I come up with something soon.  I'm not really interested in standing up in front of a bunch of stroppy teenagers and trying to teach them the finer points of direct speech or A Midsummer Night's Dream.  (Note to self - No-one's asking you to).  I wonder if I would find Primary more up my street - the older ones, say 9 - 11?  I loved teaching that age group when I worked for Bell two years ago.  Thinking aloud, thinking aloud, boring myself and you too probably (U2 - now I bet they aren't short of a bob or two, just like Simon and Garfunkel, eh Rose?) so I'll draw the line __________________________________________________________________  here.  Then again, perhaps I'll just carry on with my real-time cogitations...  It comes down to a couple of things.  I don't want to wear myself out (the M.E nastiness) and I don't want a job that overwhelms me so much that I can't pursue the 'writing in the evenings' dream. Perhaps I ought to think of a job that was somehow more directly linked to writing but God only knows what.  Perhaps I should address all this stream-of-consciousness rambling at a qualified Careers Adviser rather than at my poor long-suffering friends.  I'm so jealous of people who seem to be 'sorted' even though I know that it can be a bit of an illusion.  I hate moaning, although reliable sources say that I've toned it down a lot these days - the NMC is long behind me thank the lord.  Okay, this time, I am leaving.  Here's that daft line joke again ________________________________

      Ok all, this is the sketch.  The job interview took place yesterday at 2.15 as planned.  I managed to turn up on time looking smart (thanks for lending me the suit Rose) and trying to look like the kind of caring, sharing, yet competent person you might hire to teach traumatised refugees.  The questions were all reasonable enough (what attracted you to the post, how do you think teaching asylum seekers would be different to the work you did a la Sore-Bum - my dad's choice phrase) and I think that I answered sensibly and intelligently enough.  I even had a few questions ready to ask at the end just so that I sounded like a real keenie beanie (and I am - it's twenty grand a year remember?) so now I just have to wait.  They said they'd let me know today or tomorrow so obviously I've been on tenterhooks ever since I woke up this morning, trying to stop myself from thinking that Fate has dangled this opportunity under my nose only to cruelly snatch it away again.  This is honestly the kind of teaching I want to do - I'm not all that interested in working in a language school (although I will if I have to) as more often than not they can be real cowboy outfits and from what I've read and heard I probably wouldn't get more than 14,000 a year even in London.  I did my best I suppose, it's just I hate having to wait, I'd rather just know one way or the other.  Grrr.  I want the job, I want the job, I want the job - GIVE IT TO ME!!!!  On my back to Yarmouth tomorrow morning in time to sign on (oh, the glamour) - hopefully not for much longer.  Will keep you all posted.  Pray for me - or alternatively, call Camdem Jobtrain and tell them just how good I'd be at getting scrounging immigrants off the dole and into gainful employment - oops, sorry, was briefly possessed by the voice of my Dad there...

      I'm sitting in Rose's wee room in Rose's house somewhere on Totterdown Street, South London.  The monotony of unemployed life in 'Great' Yarmouth was all getting a bit much so I decided to spend a few days in the big smoke.  Actually the main reason for the visit is that I have a Job Interview (the job I mentioned on the blog a few updates ago, for those of you who've been tuning in on a regular basis)which I'm both excited and nervous about.  I'm pleased to have been shortlisted but I'd also really, really like to get the job as it seems to be the kind of thing I'm after and decent money (for ESOL teaching anyway).  Don't want to talk about it anymore as I'm anxious that I'll somehow tempt fate and have it all snatched from my hands before I even turn up.  Anyway, if you check into this in time cross your fingers for me tomorrow at 2.15 and let's all hope my effervescent charm and innate brilliance shine through (heh, heh, heh).

      Ok, I've been really lazy about updating the blog in the past few days but that's because there is genuinely very little that I have to update you on.  Honest.  My life remains very simple and revolves mostly around trying to stop myself go insane with boredom now that I am officially unemployed.  Alright, I'll try and think of something.  Here's a brief round-up of the latest non-events of the past few days.  1)  I've decided not to apply for the publishing job after all.  There are three reasons for this.  a) I'm too lazy to finish off the covering letter I started.  b) If I'm too lazy to finish off the covering letter I started then I think that provides a pretty good indication that I don't want the job.  c)  I did send off for loads of info on publishing from the Careers Service which helped me decide that publishing's not for me.  I'm not really keen on the idea of working in an office all the time:  I'm a people person (no, please, don't spit saliva at the screen as you snort with laughter...)  2) I found a really nice coffee shop in da big Y today.  It's called 'Take a Break'  but fortunately it's much classier than the magazine of the same name (eponymous?  is that the right word?).  There are lots of sofas and they serve all the posh coffees and have nice cakes.  That's all I ask for in a hot beverage serving establishment really.  3) I bought two great items of clothing today and only spent a total of 5.50!  I am now the proud owner of an off the shoulder sparkly top and a black sequinned cardigan.   They probably could both do with a rinse to get rid of that tell-tale dead old lady smell but hey, who cares! The joys of charity shopping!  Rose, I did us proud!  Now just in case this all seems a bit superficial and you feel cheated because you haven't had your regular dose of trademark Allen angst, here's the dream I had last night.  I actually dreamt that I was back at Cambridge, that I went to a prat crit stupidvision and that Jean Gooder told me I'd written my essay as though I were laying a carpet (seems pretty obtuse now that it's daylight but back in dreamland it seemed pretty damning).  Now, why do I still care about this stuff?  Is my subconscious doing this on purpose just to torment me?  Answers on a postcard please once again...  Oh and I'm chanting a lot at the moment.  It's really helping keep the old morale levels ticking over: you create your future with all your present thoughts and actions, the only way to be sure what the future holds is to look at the causes you're making in the present, that kind of thing.  Although things may have been pretty shite in the past year or so I do have the power to create a new life for myself in which I'm happy.  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what I intend to do.  Watch this space.

      I'm feeling really tired and it's barely eight o'clock in the evening so that's obviously a little bit frustrating.  Must remember to eat more vitamins and take regular strolls along Yarmouth's inviting seafront.    I managed to bang out a draft of my C.V today for this publishing job so I'm pleased about that even if it did take me most of the afternoon.  I still haven't finished tweaking the covering letter but once it's all polished I'll feel much better.  Doing my C.V made me realise that I've achieved a lot more than I thought I had over the past two years (always the way eh?) and so I'm generally feeling much more positive about my employability.  I still feel a bit anxious about moving to London though, especially because of how draining I found living in Paris.  Train of thought just got derailed...  what was I thinking about?  Ah yes.  I'm starting to get a bit restless here which is a bit worrying as I've only been here for a couple of days but it's not all that surprising as there isn't a great deal for me to do except watch T.V and bugger around on the Internet.  I suppose I could just take a holiday as I'm feeling a bit better but I don't really want to go away on my own.  Any offers people?  I've still never been to Cornwall even though I have a real yearning to spend some time there (no idea why - rugged coastline, wild, spiritual - that's the image in my head anyway).  I'm glad I pulled out of the summer school job but I could do with a change of scenery.  I feel like a battery that can't hold it's charge.  I want to get to the bottom of this tiredness thing once and for all or I fear it will just mar my adult life.  On the way home from 'the shop at the back' as our local Spar equivalent is locally known, I re-noticed some of the weirdest street furniture you ever did see.  Bollards in the shape of an animal more commonly found in the Arctic Circle than on the Norfolk Coast.  Polar bears? Blue whales? Yeti?  No my friends, the powers that be in their wisdom chose to install bollards in the shape of PENGUINS.  Penguins!!!  I know that the humble Fish Finger may have been invented here but frankly is there any need for this?  Did the tea lady spike the local councillors hot beverages with acid?  It's the only explanation if you ask me.

      Despite my recent lack of posts, my enthusiasm for blogging hasn't waned.  It's just really difficult at the moment for me to get access to a computer for more than about thirty seconds although hopefully all that will change this weekend as I'm going back to my parents to collect a few essentials including my laptop.   The shared house I now live in (in sunny Harlesden for those of you who are interested) has broadband so once all that's set up I'll be able to share my thoughts with my little audience a bit more regularly.  Everything's tootling along nicely at the language school.  As I said before, the pay is not all that great so I'm still looking for work in FE colleges as from September.  I had an interview last week but I really didn't like the ethos of the organisation; they seem to be focused on targets and getting people back into work asap rather than treating 'clients' like people which is not what I'm into at all.   Apparently they'll be calling people for a second round of interviews this week; I haven't heard anything but I'm really not all that bothered if they don't contact me.    Arrgh: my boss is closing the building so I'll have to leave this damp mildew infested cellar they call a staff room.   As I said, once I have a computer at home, I'll be back to regular blogging, although I'm sure my lack of posts hasn't left too much of a vacancy in your rich and varied lives...

      I know I haven't updated this for ages but I do have a pretty good excuse.  As from this Monday I now live in North West London and earn my keep teaching at a smallish language school in Hampstead.  Hampstead is beautiful - I'm trying to focus on this fact as it helps to make up for the pathetic pay - and as the more cultured among you probably already know, Freud had a house here.   I was offered the job last week while staying with Rose (a direct result of the cold-calling I mentioned) and although the money is not really what I hoped for I feel that after two months of sitting around I think I'm better off working and being independent rather than just arsing about at home.   The school is fine, none of the students are truly satantic (although there are a few Frogs - don't worry, I'll be keeping a close eye on them) and it will do nicely until I can find something better.   I have an interview tomorrow for the same kind of job I went for in the Guardian around a month ago and threw a tantrum about not getting (teaching asylum seekers ESOL and 'basic skills' i.e literacy and numeracy) so cross your fingers for me.   My main worry is that the salary is pretty poor (£12 - 16 k) and I'm a crap negociator but I'll just have to tear off a page from my canny little sister's book I suppose.  Remember, I'm passionate about MONEY not MOBILES!!!!  No, wait, I mean, I have fabulous interpersonal skills, endless patience and think I could educate illiterate Somali women who've been raped and tortured...  Please give me the job - and a living wage...  Right, must go and plan tomorrow's classes (the joys of relative clauses) and pick up my interview suit from the dry cleaners.   My next entry will be less brief and filled with my personal ruminations on life, the universe and everything for those of you who think you can stomach it.
