						     Party Weekend   It seems like I did a lot this past weekend... and here's my blog to summarize, since I didn't write about anything else yesterday besides winning the radio contest.    When the cat's away, the mice will play...   My mom and dad went to Las Vegas this weekend for a wedding, so I had the house all to myself... So what do I do?  Have a party of course!! Not too big, just close friends from Berkeley came over (Eileen, Rick, Johanna, Rowena, Chris, Oscar), we had a potluck, and played some fun games...  You can read Alan's blog for the details on what games we played.  We stayed up until 5am, singing karaoke, playing X-Box, as well as eat and just hang out.  I should have parties more often!    Bachelorette Party!   Two of our friends from Santa Clara is getting married in two weeks, so the bride had a bachelorette party on Saturday night.  (After the late night I had on Friday, I slept all day to get ready for this night.)  We were supposed to meet up at Elephant Bar, but the wait was too long so we ended up having dinner next door at El Torito instead.  The bridesmaids told us to wear wigs, and there were many different colors, which was fun to see.  After dinner, we boarded a party bus (a 'land yacht' they called it, which was more like an airport shuttle than a public transportation bus), which was cool.  It had leather interior, a bar, mirrors on the ceilings, and drink holders, and we drove to clubs in the city while having adult beverages on the bus.  First stop was Velvet Lounge... second was Glas Kat (where I saw Bern!  Turned out that she was there to celebrate her cousin's 21st bday and he was actually dancing with one of my friends! Small world)... and last was Polly Esther's.  It was definitely a fun night!    Judy's Birthday dinner   On Sunday, Alan and I went to Judy's birthday lunch at Mayflower Restaurant in Milpitas.  Really nice day and really good food.  Oh and btw, Happy Birthday Judy! (Today!)

						      ULTIMATE RADIO CONTEST WINNER!    I did it again! I won a radio contest... 2 in fact!  Yesterday, Sunday, I was driving to Alan's house at around 11am and I was listening to K101 and they were giving away Jewel tickets.  I decided to call in, and surprise, I was caller 101.  It was funny, cuz I called once, it started ringing, and then some guy came on and said I was the winner!! I thought it was quick, but who am i to argue.  I won two tickets to the Jewel concert at the Flint Center, and I became eligible for the grand prize of an emerald pendant ("jewel", get it?) that they were giving away on Monday morning at 7:30am.  So this morning, I set my alarm for 7am and turn the radio on while still in bed... My cell phone rings at around 7:25am and it's a random 415 number.  I knew it was Don Bleu! Who else would be calling at that exact hour??  And it was!!!!  He said I was the grand prize winner and that I won the pendant! I talked to him for about a minute.  He asked me why he would be calling me, and I told him that I won over the weekend and I was eligible to win the grand prize... He asked me what I did;  I said I was unemployed, just got my master's in bioinformatics, back from New York, and he joked around that they might need someone in that field to clean out the refridgerator(?).  I was so excited, I didn't really know what I was saying. :)  He put me on hold, so I called Alan from my mom's cell phone and told him to turn the radio on.  Since I know there is a time lag between my conversation and when it's on the air, I ran outside to tell my mom to listen to the radio too.  So my mom, Alan, and his mom got to hear me!  I sounded a little sleepy, since I was still sleeping when he called... oh well.  I WON!!!  Too bad I didn't tape it... I wonder if anyone on their way to work heard me on the radio :)  Man... I wonder how many people were eligible for this prize, who won over the weekend so I can calculate the odds of my winning... When I called Alan, at first he thought I won a million dollars or something... Sorry bubba. Maybe next time :)

						     Strange dreams   I had some weird dreams last night... I was somewhere in the snow and someone was shooting at me and I was shooting back...  Then I started sliding down the mountain and ended up in some little town's hospital. Another part was when I was receiving letters from what I thought was a bank or something, but turned out to be some Russian military agency trying to use me...  You all know where this is coming from right?? Too much  ALIAS !  (I am already on episode 20 - out of 22 - of the first season DVD set!  In two days!  I'm addicted.)    Blood bank for Mr. Mosquito   Seems like I had a little visitor two nights ago.  I woke up and found 2 bites on my left foot, one on my right, and two on my right arm.  It was hot that night, and I was wearing shorts.   Seems like the little bugger took a journey and bit me wherever it went.  They weren't that big yesterday during the day, but somehow got really itchy last night (they kept me up scratching!) and now they're big red spots.  Anyone know any relief for bug bites that works well?    Smallville -- sooo good!   Last night's episode of Smallville was so good, that I had to call Heidi to talk about it!! It was so cute at the end when Lana mentioned swimming and Clark brought up skinny-dipping, from his dream...

						     Fulfilled wishes!   Thanks to  urlLink Joey  for sharing with me the Dido and Black Eyed Peas songs from their new CDs;  and thanks to Sheri for letting me borrow Season 1 DVDs of Alias!  It's good to have wide network of friends... You can find just about everything :)  I'll give myself a week to finish all 22 episodes of Alias... I already watched two tonight!    Six Flags Marine World   On Saturday, we went to Marine World for Fright Fest.  We got there at about 4pm and stayed until closing (10pm).  We got to ride 3 of the roller coasters, which were pretty fun.  I had never been there ever since it turned into a Six Flags theme park.  And we went through the two haunted houses.  For the first one, Alan and I were the last ones (there were 10 of us total), so we didn't get too many scares, since we could see them all happening to the people in front of us.  For the second one, though, Alan and I were up in front, so I screamed my head off.  I'm a scaredy cat :)     Tough loss for the "Master Batters"   I went to watch Alan's team's softball playoff game today...  They were winning in the top of the last inning, but lost by one point when the other team came back in the bottom...  It was a good, at-the-edge-of-my-seat, game though! Good season guys!     Runner!   One more thing.... I've been running on Kitchie's treadmill for over a week now, and today was the first time I ran a mile! :)  I was really happy... I guess when you start running, it gets better with time and you can run farther, without even noticing... And it helped that I was watching Dawson's Creek re-runs on TBS, one where Eddie (Oliver Hudson! What a cutie!) was with Joey...

						     Great night on "The Rock"   Last night's concert on Alcatraz was awesome!!! Train played for about an hour and then Barenaked Ladies played for another hour.  They both sounded really good... I'm glad that I went to the library and borrowed the Train CDs and one of the BNL CDs.  I knew most of the songs that they sang!    Read Alan's  urlLink blog  for more details on the concert.  He recapped it pretty well.... Quick summary:  we checked in at the K101 table in front of Hard Rock Cafe at Pier 39 at 3pm, got our "All Access" passes, boarded the ferry at around 4:30pm, arrived at Alcatraz, got pretty cool gift bags (with a fleece, shirt, glow stick, rain poncho, and other stuff), walked up to the top of the island where they set up the stage, got free food(!), and watched the show!!  It was an awesome night and I'm glad I won tickets!  Check out our  urlLink pics  on ofoto!    CDs that rotate in my CD player right now     Norah Jones -  Come Away With Me   Train -  Drops of Jupiter   Train -  My Private Nation   Savage Garden -  Affirmation   Justin Timberlake -  Justified   John Mayer -  Heavier Things   John Mayer -  Room For Squares     CDs that I need to get:      Dido -  Life For Rent   Black Eyed Peas -  Elephunk   Anyone got em? :)

						     Somebody saaaaaave me!   Smallville was soooo good last night!!!  At one point, I thought Lana would find out, but I guess she still doesn't know.  How fast things change in a couple episodes.  Now she's the one who's after Clark and he's shying away.  Why is he playing hard to get?? He should just get over it and tell her.  I can't wait for next week!    Marlins Magic   I can't believe that Florida came back from 3-1 to beat the Cubs!  I feel sorry for that Cubs fan who reached out his glove in game 6 and blocked the foul ball from being caught by Alou.  I'm sure he's taking a lot of crap from everyone right about now.  Well, good job Pudge.  I think I'm gonna cheer for the Yankees to go to the World Series today.    Newlyweds    I just watched the end of the most recent Newlyweds and it was sooo funny when Jessica Simpson's mom and dad were dancing at her 23rd birthday party and her mom flat out FELL on her butt! LOL. :)    Trying to get in shape   I started running on Kitchie's treadmill downstairs everyday for about 10 minutes.  That's all I can handle for now. I hate running, but maybe I should give it a try.  I also do situps and pushups afterwards...    New Favorite Snack:  CHOCKY!    My new favorite snack that Alan introduced me to are these huge versions of Pocky - the pretzel-like sticks covered with strawberry... Alan likes the chocolate ones too.  They're called Chocky, and you can find them at an Asian supermarket near you, like Manila Oriental Market (although I went to Island Pacific near Goldilock's and they didn't have them.)  Only $1.99 for a whole bunch of these oversized Pocky.  Yummy!

						     Slacker   Yes I know, I know. I haven't posted in a while!  But I'm back...    Next year, I guess   So the Giants lost against the Florida Marlins... (So now that "Orange October" is done, I've changed my blog template too.)  Tough loss, and now, though I still watch the games, I'm not too sure who I'm rooting for... Sometimes it's the Cubs, other times it's for Florida (Pudge is really good!), and other times it's for the Yankees.  I guess I still have some New York loyalty...  Overall, it's just fun to watch good baseball.      Family weekend   My whole family was back for the weekend for my mom's birthday!  It was good to have everyone back at the house.  We went to see a movie, had lunch at our favorite Chinese restaurant (Paradise Restaurant on Westborough), and just hung out!  It's funny how I'm the one staying home now, when one year ago I was the one who left.    IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII'm Calling All Angels!!!   Have you been hearing about that big concert this Thursday on Alcatraz with Train and Barenaked Ladies?? I've been trying to win tickets all week... You have to be caller 101 some days at 9am-2pm-5pm, and some other days it's every hour...  Well, you know me and winning things on the radio.  I tried and tried and tried, and finally got through on Friday at 2pm... And I was the winner!! Caller 101! Can you believe the luck??  So Alan and I are going to the concert on Thursday!!! I'm so excited :)  Alan and I even heard myself on the radio after I won.  I sounded funny.  Anyway, it should be lots of fun.

						     SO painful    What a painful loss today!! I literally almost cried when I was watching.  Bottom of the 11th and the Marlins came back... Boo again!  We're just gonna have to win the next two!    Go 80s!   Last night at 80s night at the Cat Club in SF was really fun!! It was Eileen, Rick, Jane, Johanna, Alan and me who went.  We had so much fun dancing to 80s music.  At first I didn't really know if you could dance to that kind of music, but we soon found out that you definitely can! And you can definitely sing along too! :)      Lisa Loeb   Tonight Rick got some free tickets to the Lisa Loeb show at Slim's.  You remember her!  She sang  Stay  and  I Do .  I love going out to new places in the city!

						     BOO!   No, not trying to scare you.  BOO that the Giants lost yesterday!  It's actually a good thing that I'm at home during the day this month, so I can watch baseball! hahaha. Hopefully they make it to the next round, since I got through on the website on Monday and bought 2 tickets to the first NLCS home game at Pac Bell Park!     Rollerblading!   Today I went rollerblading with my ex-coworker Audrey (who is also job hunting after graduate school) in Mountain View.  We went to the park right near Shoreline Amphitheater and there were some trails there.  It felt good to do something active, especially since I've been just sitting around the house for a month straight.  I'll probably try going blading around Lake Merced a couple days a week... or even try running it!    Cat Club   Tonight I'm meeting up with the crew at this club that holds 80's nights... It should be fun, hearing all the old school music and seeing people dressed up in 80s gear... Remember the times of fluorescent clothing, high hair-dos, double socks, and tapered jeans??? Come on! I know you do... We were all victims of the 80's.

						     Non-stop eating!   Had lots of food this long weekend.... family party at my house on Thursday night, Alan's family party at his house on Friday night, and then of course leftovers...  I love eating leftover honey baked ham... toss it in a frying pan, let it fry and burn the edges, cook an over-hard egg, and eat for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!      Lots of shows this weekend too!   My family and I saw the Stephen Sondheim musical  A Little Night Music  at the Post Street theater in SF on Friday.  My mom got some free tickets from her company, so we went to see it.  The only song I knew was "Send in the Clowns", but it was good anyway.    Then on Saturday morning, we all went to see the movie  Love Actually .  Sweet, sweet movie about different kinds of love.  I love Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. =)    Then on Saturday night, Kitchie, Damon, Alan, and I went to see  Alegria  which is the Cirque du Soleil production that is playing in SF right now.  It was in a huge tent in the middle of the Pacific Bell Park parking lot.  It was a great show, with different acrobatic-type performances, clowns, and live music.  I definitely recommend it.  Now I want to see the other shows, like the ones in Vegas!    What? Me not shop on the biggest shopping day of the year??   Yup.  I didn't go to ONE store the day after Thanksgiving, or the next, or the next.  No shopping for me this past weekend.  I'm very proud of my self-control :) hehe.    Rain Rain Go Away   Come again another day.

						     Turkey Day celebration!   This past Saturday, Alan and I went to a Thanksgiving dinner with all our friends from SCU.  There were about 20 of us, and it was nice because it was a sit-down dinner, 2 tables of 10 each.  Christina and Nelson hosted it in their house in SF and we had turkey, ham, potatoes, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, veggies, pie, wine, and other good food!! The rest of the night was spent singing karaoke, comparing everyone's scores, and then doing guy group vs. girl group karaoke.  I think the girls won every round ;).   Good night of friends, food, and fun.  Check out the  urlLink pics !    Job's going well   It's great to be working again!! I feel like I do a lot during the day, compared to before, where I would just be at home watching TV and eating.  Plus I think I've lost a couple of the pounds I gained while slumming around.   I think I'm pretty used to the every day commute (unless there's an accident and it takes more than 2 hours!), and I got my FasTrak sensor in the mail.  Plus, today is my first payday! :)     It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas...   I noticed that 96.5FM KOIT plays all Christmas music now.  I love the feeling you get when you hear Christmas music.  I love this time of year!  Plus, the air is getting a little colder... reminds me of my year in New York.    Vegas in January   I'm going on a girls-only Vegas trip at the end of January with my girlfriends from SCU.  Notice I said MY, and not ALAN'S.  Yes, they're my friends too...  It's great to have different groups of friends to hang out with.  Anyway, we're going during the last weekend of January... none of us girls realized it was Superbowl weekend until later!  Oh well. I'm not that into football anyway... If it was World Series time, then I'd have to think about it :)    Happy Thanksgiving all!   Have a great long weekend!

						     New Job!   I started my new job at Celera Diagnostics yesterday!  I really like the company and the work I'm gonna be doing.  I had a couple of glitches with my email and my accounts... since I worked at Celera Genomics last year, my old account was still active, so it got all confused.  But most of it is sorted out now.  I have a cubicle (well not really a cubicle with 3 walls, more like a section with a desk - with someone right next to me separated by a divider), but it's next to the window! I look outside and see the fountain right in front of our building... very refreshing.    Lunch!   My boss took us out to lunch yesterday for sushi!  I think that's the first time I went to a Japanese restaurant and only ate sushi and no other food.  I ordered my favorite - Philadelphia Roll - and we ordered some other stuff like the Lambada Roll, Island Roll, and Spider Roll.  I really liked the Island Roll - with salmon on top and tempura inside.  Yummmmm....    The commute!   So far the commute to work isn't too bad... around 50minutes to 1 hr, traffic on 101 towards the bay bridge.  The commute home yesterday was the worst!! I think it took me about 2 hours to get home... probably because of the 49ers game.  Today wasn't too bad... around 1 hour.  I might try taking BART/AC Transit to work and back home one day.  My company has commuter checks, which will pay for public transportation expenses (50% of total commute expenses) up to $100.  So I won't be too stressed out and I can read books on my way to work!    Diploma & Frame   I officially have my master's degree, as seen by the diploma and frame that I got in the mail today... Now I just have to make room on the wall next to our CAL diplomas.

						     Nemo!   I just watched  Finding Nemo  and it's soooo cute!! The animation is amazing and the story flows so well!  Lots of suspense... I even yelled outloud during a couple of parts... Definitely worth renting or buying!  I want a big Nemo stuffed animal now!    Non-stop eating   Seems like I've been eating and eating all weekend... First was Nick & Diep's wedding... What a great day! Lots of surprises and touching moments, and food of course!! A ?-course meal at Mayflower Restaurant in Milpitas!  So much good food.  On Sunday, Alan and I went over to our friends' (Nelson & Christina) house in San Francisco for dinner with one of my high school/college friends (Regina) who is in town for a couple weeks from UCSD Med School.  We caught up on our lives, looked at wedding pictures, and got some tips for Regina's wedding next year!  It's great to see old friends and feel like nothing has changed!  Today, my mom, Heidi, my Auntie Syv, Lolo, and Lola went to a Chinese restaurant for lunch - we had walnut prawns, beef with oyster sauce, sweet & sour rock cod, chicken corn soup, and fried rice!!! Yummmmm....    Treadmill Mishap   So I tried to run on the treadmill this morning (to try to work off all that food!) and as soon as I started running, I knew something was off...  With every step, my footing seemed unstable, like I was landing wrong or something.  I just kept running and something happened to the treadmill's rotating belt and I literally fell down and hurt my wrist.  It hurt like hell, I pulled the emergency cord to make it stop and I got up.  I called my sister and she said sometimes it happens and that Damon would know how to fix it.  I should have trusted my first instincts and stopped - so I haven't run in 3 days and I really want to! Who knew running would be this addicting...

						     The search is over!   After two months of looking for a job back here in the bay, I accepted a great offer at  urlLink Celera Diagnostics  in Alameda! I'm really excited to start working again, especially in this position.  The people are cool, it's a nice building near the water, and the work they're doing is really interesting.  The only thing is the commute... about 50 minutes each way, crossing the Bay Bridge.  Needless to say, I ordered a FasTrak sensor, so I don't have to worry about finding $2 for toll everyday!  My start date is Monday, November 17th, so I'm enjoying my last few days of 'vacation'!

						     Spookalicious 2003   Halloween was fun this year! Alan and I went to a costume party at our friends' (Nate & Michele) condo in San Francisco.  All of us dressed up in costume, had food and drinks, played card games, and then walked around the streets of San Francisco going into some of the bars and seeing different people in costumes! Then we went back to their place and watched  Nightmare on Elm Street .  I fell asleep and missed some of the action... Apparently one of our friends was really sick and had a little accident.  Nonetheless, it was a fun night! I love getting dressed up!   Click  urlLink here  to see our pics!    Baby Shower!   My mom, Alan, and I went to my aunt's baby shower on Sunday... They had lots of good food and a whole bunch of games!!  One was a safety pin game (similar to the clothespin game at bridal showers).  You can't say the word 'baby' or else someone can steal your safety pin from you.  Whoever has the most by the end, wins!  They changed it up every hour, so the rules changed... like one hour, you can't touch your stomach.  I even got to steal my mom's!  Other games were baby word Taboo, guess the animal (they gave us the names of baby animals and we had to guess what animal it was), cotton soup (pick up as many cotton balls with a soup ladle into a bowl - blindfolded!), put a diaper on the 'baby' (the babies were grown adults, so it was really funny!), a baby-naming contest (they told us to give suggestions for their baby's name - had to start with "G").  It was pretty fun!

						     All caught up on  Alias  I finally finished watching the last disc of the season 2 DVDs of Alias.  Now I'm all caught up... I kinda want to re-watch the first couple episodes of this season, just to remember how it all ties in together.  I'm sure they'll be showing re-runs this season.  I think they've already started doing it, since the next new one isn't until 2 weeks from now!    Free candy!   There's a basket full of free candy upstairs in our lunchroom, and it happens to be one of my favorite types of candy!  I was so excited when I saw them!  They're those little strawberry wrapped hard candies like  urlLink these .  Everytime I go up there, I grab a handful...  I have such a sweet tooth... not for chocolate though, but for fruity candy.  I can eat any type of fruity candy anytime, anyday.  My faves - these, Mamba, and any sour gummy candies.

						     Mini-party @ work   Just had free pizza and salad upstairs in our lunchroom.  Lots of people are still here actually.  They had gift baskets and raffled off all the individual pieces like boxes of crackers, cheese, cookies, and almost everyone at our table won something, except for me and a couple of other people.

						     Shopping!   Didn't do too much shopping this year, but what I did do, I was very happy with.... Besides waiting until the last minute and running into the tons of people at malls, my shopping experience this year was pretty good...    Still at work   I'm still at work right now, but it's pretty much like a ghost-town.  Even my boss left today already! I think I'll stay for the pizza/raffle at lunchtime that my company is doing for the people who are still here, and then we'll see how it goes after lunch.  I still have some work to do, but maybe it can wait until next Monday.     Merry   Christmas!

						     Return of the King!   The movie was sooo good!  I didn't even notice how long I was sitting there, watching the whole thing for about 3 1/2 hours!  The audience was cool - clapping when it started, during key scenes, etc.  There was this one scene where Legolas (the elf; Orlando Bloom) kicked ass!  So cute :) I think I was to go back and re-read the books again.  Go see it!     Sleepy     I'm sleepy right now.  Maybe it's cuz I saw a movie last night from 8-midnight. Or maybe it's because I just ate lunch... zzzz. I need to wake up!

						     Holiday Parties galore!   This past weekend Alan and I went to 3 holiday gift exchange parties! 3 parties in 3 days!! I think I lost a lot of precious sleep, but it's ok cuz I had a lot of fun!  On Friday night, we partied it up at Diana and Mark's house in E. Palo Alto with all our Santa Clara friends.  For the gift exchange, I ended up with this nice set of martini glasses.  Alan ended up with a crockpot that he really wanted... or did he?  We also played The Twleve Days of Christmas Unplugged, where we make up our own gifts for the song.  Some were pretty funny...  On Saturday night, we had a party at Alan's house with all of his SHC (high school) friends.  Lots and lots of food at this party!! It seems like all his HS friends always bring tons and tons of food! It was yummy.  For the gift exchange, I got the Finding Nemo DVD and a $10 giftcard to Starbucks.  We also had a gag gift exchange, and I got this little nail cutting kit (with clippers, tweezers, etc.)  Alan ended up with a box of old party favors! It was pretty funny.  On Sunday afternoon, we went over to Jane & Oscar's place in Oakland to get together with all our friends from Cal.  Yummy food there too... there was adobo, lumpia, Zachary's pizza, lasagna, and lots and lots of wine.  For that gift exchange, I got the new Alicia Keys CD.  We also played MAFIA, and I almost got away with being the 'killer', but David and Jane caught me.  For all the pics, check out Alan's photo  urlLink gallery !    LOTR III   Tonight we're going to see  Lord of the Rings: Return of the King  at Union Landing with my ex-coworkers from Incyte.  Since I saw the first one (two years ago) with them during the workday (hehe), we're getting together again!  I'm so excited!! Alan and I watched the second one last night, just to refresh our memories!  Can't wait to see Legolas and Aragorn! :)    One month!   It's been one month exactly today since I started working again! Time flies by so quickly when you're earning money :) heheh.

						     Early paycheck!   I was expecting to get paid tomorrow which is when they told me we get paid (every other Thursday), but when I checked my bank account online, I had a direct deposit!  Yippee.  I love getting paid!    Josh Groban   I was listening to the radio (96.5 KOIT) going home the other day and when I was about one minute to my house, they started playing Josh Groban's "O Holy Night", and  I waited in front of my house for about 4 minutes until the song was over.  I love this guy's voice!  I don't know how to describe it, but it gives me chills and makes me tear every time I hear it.  It's that touching.  Too bad his concert in Oakland in January is sold out!  Maybe I can find some cheap tix on ebay, but I doubt it...since it sold out the day it went on sale. And he only has one show!  Maybe I'll just borrow his special on DVD and find a copy of his CD somewhere .... (ahem, ahem.. a request, Joey.) hehe.    Lunch with Rex   Had lunch with Rex today at... guess where??? Sushi House! My one and only favorite restaurant that I know around here.  He lives in Oakland, so he just drove over to pick me up.  We ordered my favorite - Island Roll, his favorite - Power Roll, and new one - Crunchy Roll.  They were all very very good, but my favorite is still the Island Roll.  Wanna know what I'm talking about?  Look  urlLink here .

						     Holiday Party   This past Saturday was my company's holiday party.  It was held at the Crowne Plaza Union Square in San Francisco.  Besides the fact that it was totally pouring outside and my toes got wet since I was wearing open-toed heels with my dress, it was a great night! They had hor d'ourves before the dining room offically opened.  It was a buffet-style dinner with 4 different food stations set up around the room.  One was seafood (with salmon, clam chowder, and calamari), another was Mexican food (tacos, tamales, etc), another was Italian (pasta, foccacia bread, etc) and the other was Chinese food (chow mein, egg rolls, beef w/ broccoli, etc).  The food was yummy.  And there was even a separate room for the desserts - egg nog, cakes, gingerbread men, coffee, tea.  The cheesecake was so good.  I topped it off with fresh strawberries too. Yumm.  For the entertainment, they had a dancefloor and a DJ.  But I don't think most people danced.  Everyone was at the Casino room, where they hired people to set up a Craps table, a handful of blackjack tables, and a roulette table.  We each got $200 of fake chips, and we played for the whole night.  At the end of the night, we traded in our chips for raffle tickets - $100 per raffle ticket.  Alan and I ended up only getting 2 raffle tickets, which means that we lost $200....More like "I" lost $200.  But I had the most fun at the Craps table. We spent maybe 80% of the time there...  Overall, it was a great party.  Nice and cozy - about 175 people.  I met lots of people (since I don't know too many yet).  It was a great icebreaker.    Crazy for ALIAS!   So I joined the Walmart DVD rentals last week, since I knew that the Alias Season 2 DVDs were coming out last Tuesday.  So I listed the first 2 DVDs on my queue and the website said they were both shipped on 12/02/03.  So I'm waiting, waiting waiting for them, and I got one last Wednesday but it was Disc 2! How can I watch the second one before the first? Well, I can't... So I'm waiting, waiting, waiting for the first one, and it never comes!  I wanted to watch them so badly since I didn't really do anything all day on Sunday.    So I finally give up on the Walmart DVD and start calling around Blockbusters to see if they have them for rent. I called at least 4 different Blockbusters until I finally found one that had it - in Millbrae! So I put it on hold, rush over there, and finally get it! So I watched both discs 1 & 2 in one sitting - about 6 hours straight on Sunday afternoon...  And to top it off, there was another new episode for this season at 9pm.  I love ALIAS!    Now I'm waiting for discs 3,4,5 and 6.  Hopefully Walmart won't screw it up this time :)    Have a good week!

						     Daily afternoon ritual   I've noticed that I'm beginning to have a ritual here at work during the afternoon. At around 3pm, I go upstairs to our lunchroom and make myself a cup of hot tea.  They have my favorite tea here!  It’s called Lemon Lift and they used to have it an Incyte when I was working there too.  Hot water, the tea bag, and 2 packets of C&H sugar.  Stir it around with a stirrer, let it sit on my desk for about 15 minutes to cool it down, and enjoy.   Ah, the simple pleasures in life.    Late to work   For the past two days, I’ve been getting to work relatively late (at around 9:35am).  Seems late to me, but I end up leaving home at 8:30am and there’s always traffic getting on to the Bay Bridge.  Getting in late means leaving late, which I don’t mind since going back the traffic isn’t too bad at around 6:30pm.  I actually get to use my FasTrak without stopping! (unlike if I leave at 5pm, it’s backed up and it’s stop-and-go through the toll plaza).  I guess I can’t have no traffic both ways, unless I wanna get in really early and leave really late.    First day off   I’m taking my first day off of work tomorrow, the 4th!  I have one discretionary holiday that I have to use before the end of the year, so I’m taking tomorrow off.  So I scheduled a doctor’s appointment and other stuff to do tomorrow.  Plus it’s our 4 year anniversary! =)

						     In preparation for Valentine's and...   ... because I'm in love. :)  New colors!     Eye hurts   For some reason, my right eye started getting irritated today.  When I looked at my contact lens, I saw that it had a small tear on the side.  That's probably the reason why.  Oh well. I'm gonna change them tomorrow. It's almost time to anyway, since it's the end of the month.    Can't wait for Vegas!   I'm taking Friday off, since we're leaving for Vegas in the morning!!  I'm going with all my girlfriends from Santa Clara (about 12 of us!) and we'll be there all weekend! I can't wait to gamble - blackjack and craps! I hope I win. :)    Bye Bye January   This month has gone by so quickly! It seemed like it was just last week when Alan proposed...

						     Shocking!   For some reason, here at work, I get shocked a lot.  Meaning, when I open the door or when I touch the metal desk, I get a huge electric shock that is starting to hurt every time.  Today, I even saw a little blue spark between my finger and the doorknob.  Yikes.  This can't be good for my heart.    Somebody stop the noise!   This past weekend, my laptop started doing something really weird.  The fan became extremely loud, and it's non-stop!  Plus it completely slows down my computer.  I don't know what's going on :(  It's so annoying.  Any IT people out there wanna help me?    Almost there!   On Saturday, Alan and I checked out 3 different places for receptions.  These 3 are definitely our top choices so far.  Now it's a matter of trying to pick one.  But hopefully we'll have one decided by the end of this week! Yay :)    XYZ at the W   Sunday night, us girls (Johanna, Rowena, Eileen, Jane, and I) went out for a nice dinner at XYZ in the city.  It's the restaurant at the W Hotel on 3rd and Howard.  It was one of the restaurants that's part of the  urlLink Dine About Town, SF  program, with prix fixe menus for $29.95.  The food was really good!! I had a nice salad with special dressing (Really good dressing), the pork entree (which was really tender and full of flavor), and the pineapple upside down cake with ice cream.  We also got wine with dinner.  Overall, an excellent meal.  A nice girls-night-out!

						     Tuesday night Sushi   Last night, I had dinner with most of the crew at Sushi House in Alameda.  So, here's who the 'crew' usually is:  Alan, me, Eileen, Rick, Johanna, Jane, Oscar, Rowena, Chris, Eric, and Marjorie.  We waited about 1 1/2 hours to get seated.  I didn't know it got so busy at night!  So good though... Island roll!!   Afterwards, we went to Albertson's to pick up some chips for the salsa at Jane & Oscar's place, and we also picked up some ready-to-bake cookies and milk.  We went over to their place, and just hung out.  We played Texas Hold-Em poker and blackjack with all the coins in Oscar's coin jar.  Johanna showed us pics from her trip to Thailand and they showed me pics from their Vegas trip this past weekend!  We had lots of fun, especially for a weeknight and especially without any adult beverages :)    Still hunting   Alan and I are still on the hunt for a reception place.  We've visited half a dozen places but only liked one so far.  We have more appointments this weekend and at one of them, we finally get to have a food tasting! Alan is very excited about that! :)    Work is busy!   I've been so busy at work these past couple of days! It's crazy!  But I guess when I go to Vegas next week, I know I'd have earned it.    Covad Winter Gala   We went to Alan's company holiday party on Saturday night at the Hayes Mansion in San Jose.  Great place, great good, and great entertainment/music.  I got to meet a lot of his co-workers and talk to them and their wives.  He introduced me as his 'fiancee' for the first time and they all asked how he proposed.  It's fun telling people the story.      ALIAS!   It was soooo good.  Can't wait to see what happens next!

						     Over-snoozed   I usually set my alarm for 6am, and then keep hitting the snooze button until 7am when I usually get out of bed.  The snooze goes off every 9 minutes, but after an hour, the alarm completely turns off and no more snoozing.  Anyway, so this morning, I snooze til 7am and I go back to sleep... Next thing I know, my mom walks into my room and tells me it's 8:00am!  Oh man.  My heart was beating so fast, I got ready in about 20 minutes and was out of the house by 8:25am.  Usually it takes me an hour to get to work, but fortunately the traffic into the city wasn't bad today! So I got to work at about 9:10am, which is the normal time I get in.  Whew!  Maybe I should stop using the snooze button and get up when the alarm goes off...    The Butterfly Effect   Last night, I saw Ashton Kutcher's new movie  The Butterfly Effect  which isn't even officially out yet.  Auds got some free passes to a preview showing from SCU and so Mike, Abby, Auds, Ben, Alan and I went.  The movie was pretty good... good effects and a different type of story.  Some parts were really scary - like jump-out-of-your-seat scary, some parts were funny (although I don't know if they were meant to be), and some parts reminded me of The Sixth Sense.  Overall, I give it a B+.

						     Oh My Gosh!!! THAT LIAR!   That's all I have to say about last night's new episode of Alias!! If you don't know what I'm talking about, let's just say that FINALLY the real truth about someone I didn't like came out!!  I can't wait for next week's episode... :)    House Party II   Friday night, I had another house party (since my mom was away! hehe).  The whole Berkeley crew came over (except Johanna who is out of the country) and we ate, drank, played Mafia, and of course Kings!! Alan and Oscar got the king's cup this time... they almost made me believe that I got the second one, but I noticed it was only the 3rd king! Anyway, we had lots of fun rules this time... like everytime a guy had to drink, the girls had to do 5 pushups!! But we got them back by saying that everytime we had to do 5, they had to do 10 of these up-and-down pushups....  Needless to say, everyone was tired from laughing and doing pushups that night.    In search of a reception place   Alan and I started visiting different reception places this past weekend, and we definitely know what we want/don't want.  It's fun to look around though, to see what places offer... Hopefully we'll have a site set soon.

						     My preciousssss   After being apart from my ring for almost 4 whole days, I finally got it back from the jeweler last night... and it's so pretty.   I love the new band, and now it fits!  I can't help but stare at it and see how it catches and reflects every ray of light.... It's so pretty!  My precious...     Thank you!   Thanks to everyone for all the well wishes!  I was happy to share the good news with my family and friends.

						     Great start to a new year!   Last Friday night was Alan's birthday dinner at F&A's.  I had planned out the whole thing, dinner and then dancing afterwards... Little did I know that my life would be changed forever...  The dinner was fun!  We had the whole restaurant to ourselves.  Since we had a group of 30, F & A's didn't take any other reservations.   We had a whole table of family - Kitchie, Damon, Heidi, Abby, Mike, Auds, Ben, and Alan's parents.  Then a whole bunch of our Santa Clara friends came by and some Berkeley friends too!  Dinner was pretty good... I had the 7-seasoned fresh catch (which was salmon that day).  Towards the end of dinner, I see my mom and dad walk into the restaurant! I was really surprised, because when I left the house, they were already in their pajamas getting ready to go to sleep!!!  So I was a little confused, but was starting to think of why they were here....  Hmm.... my whole family, Alan's whole family, our close friends, and Ben and Auds taking pictures all the time and even taking a video of the night?? Suspicious.  Also, before I left the house, I heard Alan call Kitchie on her cell phone.  Now why would Alan call her, I thought?  And I was evesdropping when Kitchie tried to secretly talk to my mom and dad about "something".  Anyway, after dinner, Alan stands up and starts making a thank-you speech.  He quoted a poem on friendship and made a toast to all his friends, he thanked his parents and toasted them.  Same to his sisters, MY parents, and MY sisters... And last .... GOD.   It was pretty funny when he said "God" because I, and probably a lot of other people, thought he was gonna toast me.  But after thanking God, he started to tell the story of how we met 4 1/2 years ago... how his eyes didn't shy away when we first met, how he wanted to get to know me better, how  I  asked  HIM  to be my boyfriend when we were driving back from Jack-in-the-Box in Berkeley, how I am the "wind beneath his wings", how he always asks me "When are you going to ask me to marry you?".    (By this point in time, I kinda knew what was coming. I started tearing when he was saying all these things to me.  I noticed that everyone on the sides was gathering around us, waiting with their cameras in hand for something to happen.)  So he said it was his turn to ask, and he got down on his knee, asked his mom for the ring (she was holding it for him... hehe) and proposed.  And of course, I said yes!  So now we're engaged! :)  What a great birthday!  I'm so happy, and I love my ring! :) And we have the whole night on tape.  What a great memory...  Check out pics from the most wonderful night of my life on Alan's site...

						     Happy New Year!!   Welcome to 2004!! Last night, Alan and I went to his sister and her husband's house for a last-minute party, which turned out to be pretty fun!  Lots of food, we were watching LOTR II, and we played Mafia!  It was a good chance from the past few years where we didn't really do anything for NYE except watch the ball drop.    Happy New Year! Can't wait to see what this year has in store for everyone :)

						     Happy Leap Year Day!   February 29th... only happens every 4 years.  I enjoyed my February 29th this year. Did you?    Bridal Expo at Hillsdale Mall   Alan and I met up at Hillsdale Mall in San Mateo for their annual Bridal Expo.  There were lots of booths of different vendors, and also a fashion show! It's really fun being engaged, going to these faires, talking to different people, and getting free stuff.  This was our second one... the first one we went to was at the Decathlon Club in Santa Clara last Thursday.  I'm getting a better idea of how much things cost.    To top it off today, I won a raffle for this unity candle set from the Candle House!  I entered lots of raffles, and I got a call saying I won.  So I went to the store and picked it up.  It's pretty nice, and we're going to use it during our ceremony at the Mission!    Pho Night (or for me .... Pizza Night!)   Loan hosted a Pho Night at her house in San Jose on Friday night.  It smelled really good, but since it was Friday and Lent, I couldn't eat it.  But she had cheese pizzas for us, so that was good!  We had good food, drinks, and played games like Catch Phrase, Texas Hold 'Em, and Twister!! It was so funny!  Can't wait to have BBQs at her house, since she has a really nice grill in her backyard.    The Passion   On Saturday, we met up with Lisa, Dale, Rowena, and Jay to see  The Passion of the Christ  at the Century Theaters in Milpitas.  I thought it was a great movie, depicting the last hours of our Lord Jesus.  Some scenes were really graphic, but it made me appreciate more what Jesus went through for us.  It was very emotional for me, but overall I thought it was a good movie.   I learned a few things that I didn't know before, and it made me curious, so I might go back and read the Scriptures over to refresh my memory.  I particularly liked how the movie ended, on a good and uplifting note.    Happy March!   Here's to a new month of planning for the wedding! I only have 10 more months! =)

						     We found it!!   We finally found our reception place and we love it!! Alan and I had more appointments this past weekend, and our second one on Saturday turned out to be THE ONE!  We are really excited about it, since it's so close to the Mission, it's really nice inside, the lady was really helpful, and even the ballroom is called the Santa Clara Ballroom.  And even the rooms that it breaks down to for smaller events are named after familiar street names near SCU, like Lafayette, San Tomas, Lawrence, Stevens Creek, and Winchester...  I think it was meant to be.   Now that that's chosen, now it's time to start thinking about other things.... like the dress! I can't wait to try some more on.    Crate & Barrel Sunday Morning Engagements   On Sunday morning, Alan and I went to the Crate & Barrel in SF Union Square for a special event for engaged couples.  They talked to us about registries, showed us some of their stuff, and gave us a scanning gun to scan stuff we wanted on our registry! So we walked around the whole store for 2 hours, scanning stuff!  It was really fun...   I know it's a bit early for creating our registry, but I think they only have these in February, so we wanted to get our's in.  We got free champagne flutes and they had lots of free food around the store, like waffles, chocolate fondue with strawberries and bread, freshly squeezed orange juice, and my favorite - mimosas (champagne w/ OJ) ... all made with things you can buy in the store.  We saw  urlLink Bev & Gary  at the store too!    Sex and the City Finale   Sunday night, all the girls went over to Jane's place and we watched the last episode ever of  Sex and the City .  Even though I haven't really been too into it since I don't have cable, I do have the Season 2 DVD set which I got for a gift, so I kinda new the characters.  Jane and Johanna gave me the rundown of what was happening, so I was eventually caught up.   We had food, and we even made cosmopolitans!  A fun girly event! :)

						     Happy Hour & Cat Club!   Last night, I went to the  urlLink PAAC  Happy Hour at Jillian's, ate some free food, talked to alum, and watched the Cal basketball game.  There weren't too many people I knew there - they were either older or younger people who I didn't know.  But Johanna, Jane, Oscar, Alan, were there - also Paul, Eric, Bern, Ryan, Bim, and Lizelle.  Afterwards, the crew went to the Cat Club! Amazing how everyone made it out last night! It was really fun... all 80s music all night long.  It's fun dancing to 80s cuz you can sing along and dance crazy!    TGIF!   Wasn't I just saying this?  This week went by so quickly, maybe because Monday was a holiday and it was really busy at work this week.    Still reception hunting...   We thought we were pretty much done looking at places, but it turns out that this weekend we have 4 appointments! It's amazing what hotels will do to cut the prices once you tell them their packages don't fit your budget.  So now, we have appointments with hotels that I didn't even think to even make an appointment with after I saw the initial prices.  It's great!  And they're closer to the Mission too!    Training for the Mud Run   Tomorrow, Alan and I are gonna go running to train for the  urlLink Mud Run  in June!  This year, there are 4 teams going, 2 all girls and 2 all guys.  It should be fun!  My team - Johanna, Jane, Eileen, Rowena, and me picked the clever name of 'Drrty Girls' =)    Blue Nile!   Forgot to blog about Kitchie's bday!! Last weekend, we went to Blue Nile Ethiopian Restaurant in Berkeley.   Good food! You eat with your hands, so it was fun with everyone - about 23 people were there to celebrate!  I bought her a little cupcake from the bakery next door about a minute after they closed.  I just stood at the door and begged them to sell me one thing, and they opened up!  hehe.  Happy Birthday Kitchie!!!

						     "Kara-okay" on Alice   I've been listening to Alice 97.3 in the morning on my way to work and I have to say that Sarah and No Name are really funny! Today, the whole morning, they were all singing karaoke songs... so so funny! I was laughing outloud!  I finally joined Alice Everyday Rewards and I get up at 7am to hear the word of the day.  That show takes my mind off of the long commute everyday.     Happy Valentine's Day!   ...tomorrow. And Happy Birthday to my sister Kitchie! (tomorrow too)    TGIF!

						     What's on the tube tonight?   Alan always asks me this question every night, to see what's on TV.  Since I know pretty much all the shows he watches (since I watch the same ones), and I know if they're new episodes or not, I tell him.   The shows have been really good this month! I guess cuz it's February sweeps?  So here's what I watch. You decide if it's too much: Monday - NOTHING! Tuesday - I'm With Her, One Tree Hill Wednesday - Smallville Thursday - Friends Friday - Joan of Arcadia, Boston Public  I don't think that's too many, do you?  One Tree Hill was really good last night! A major cliffhanger at the end.  Joan of Arcadia was so good last Friday that it made me cry.  I'm With Her is fun, since I secretly dream of meeting famous people.  (Well, I guess not 'secretly')  Smallville is cool, cuz it's Superman!! (and esp. since it's Tom Welling).  I've watched Boston Public from the start, but I think it's getting the ax soon.  And Friends is awesome... just because it's Friends.    Pulling me back in...   I've been watching my favorite soap opera,  General Hospital , for years and years now, and just recently, I haven't been too into it.  I had 3 taped episodes from last week that I wasn't gonna watch, since I was trying to wean off it until I stopped completely... But of course, it pulled me back in, since there's a huge fire at the Port Charles Hotel and everyone and their mom is stuck in it.  I can't stop watching now! I have to see what happens!!  So I guess my plan isn't working.  Oh well.  Sonny and Jason are hot =)

						     Wake up!   It's so nice and sunny outside, but I've been feeling sleepy all day! This weahter is kinda reminding me of New York, since the last time that I've seen 'summery' weather like this was last summer in NY.  Plus listening to the old Norah Jones CD also reminds me of listening to it right before I fell asleep over there.  But seriously, I need to wake up.     new Norah Jones CD   I'm so excited for the new Norah Jones CD.  Thanks Joey for telling me you got it! =P    Going to the hukilau   Saturday night, we went to our friend Christina's birthday dinner at a Hawaiian restaurant in the Sunset district of SF called E Komo Mai.  It was really good food... reminded me of luau food in Hawaii.  There was a live band all night, playing songs and there were hula dancers too.  Christina even got up there and danced a little with them too.      Wedding stuff!   Alan and I hung out with Bev & Gary last night.  While Gary was showing Alan some of his wedding DVDs, slideshows, and everything else on his Mac, Bev showed me all her wedding stuff!! It was fun to see everything she had!  I think I need to start a wedding binder too... =)

						     VEGAS!   Vegas was so fun this past weekend... If you're wondering why I haven't been blogging lately, I've just been so tired, and it's probably b/c of this weekend... But I had a blast!   Friday  We got there early on Friday morning, got to check into the Monte Carlo early (since one of our three rooms was ready), dropped off all our luggage and went to Carrow's next door for some breakfast.  Afterwards, Michele and I went to go gamble at Paris while the other girls went shopping at Aladdin.  We played Pai Gow poker for about 2 hours and ended up being $20 up!   While walking back to the hotel, we decided to stop by the Boardwalk to see what kind of tables we'd find, and we ended up play at $5 blackjack and then $5 craps!! Craps was awesome!! I had a hot streak as a shooter and ended up winning around $75!! Awesome :)  For dinner we went to the Paris cafe restaurant where we made up fake names for all of us when we went clubbing... Let's see.. there was Crystal Bubbles, Jackie O. Foto, Trista Field, Celine Dinhon, Bianca Manolo, Justice Timberlake, Ling Belding, Mia Randy, Niki Mounts, Tina Proteina, and Ivana ____....help me out Jackie O!...I know you're reading...  We waited for 'Ling' and 'Mia' to get to the hotel and we left for Drai's (the after hours club at Barbary Coast.)  We all started off with an apple martini, got more drinks throughout the night, and danced the night away!! Very fun.   Saturday  We woke up really late (~noon) and I had a really bad headache and felt really sick. Let's just say that I was 'praying to the porcelain god' for hours, before I actually felt better.  For lunch, some of us went back to the Paris cafe, and then afterwards went gambling again... Pai Gow poker, of course!  I lost $30 in that round, but I was still up.  For dinner, we went to the food court at the bottom of Monte Carlo.  We got ready to go out again, and went to two clubs that night.  It was quite an interesting night...  We got to the Palms hotel to go to the club RAIN, and there was a really long line!!  But we figured a way to get into the VIP line and got in within 30 minutes...  And it ended up being the same price as the regular line!  Awesome.    The club inside was really cool, with a raised dancefloor in the middle, with fire flaming above it every once in a while.  We got some drinks and pretty much dance the whole night away until we were dead tired.  There was a really long line of people waiting for taxis in front of the Palms, so we decided to walk on the street and try to hail a cab on our town... but no luck... So we walked some more, in our high heels with our feet aching, to this small casino a couple blocks down and got cabs from there...  We went to the McDonald's at the Monte Carlo food court when we got back, since we were hungry, and then went to sleep....   Sunday, the last day  Sunday we got up early and went to eat at the Noodle House in the Monte Carlo.  It was a good lunch, with everyone around a red-tablecloth-covered table chatting and talking about people (who weren't there)... hehe.  Jackie O & I shared the lettuce wraps and the beef chow fun.... yummmy..  Ruby's parents came to pick us up at 2pm and went to their house! We had some food there, watched part of the SuperBowl, went to see model homes, and then headed off to the airport to go home!  What a great weekend!  I had Vegas-withdrawal the next day and could hardly stay awake at work, but it was worth it!

						     Dress shopping!   I went back to Bay Area Bridal this past weekend with my whole family, and I finally bought my wedding dress!  I won't describe it here (since I know Alan will be reading), but let's just say that it wasn't what I originally thought it would be.  Things I didn't think I'd like, well, it's not so bad after I tried on this dress.  I guess you'll just have to wait and see what I'm talking about.  But I'm glad that it's ordered, so it can start getting made.    Fondue!   Alan and I went to a Fondue Party on Saturday night at our friend Christina's house in SF.  My first time fondue-ing =) There was lots of bread, asparagus, strawberries, apples, bananas, chicken sticks to dip into cheese or chocolate.  Yummy!  Then we sang karaoke for a while, played Texas Hold Em (I lost again!! I thought I said no more gambling? Oh well, it was only a $1 buy-in), and watched one of Alan's videotapes of the senior cruise.  Everyone said that Alan and I looked the same as 4 years ago... have we not aged?    Dinner at Jimmy & Elena's   On Sunday night, my former co-workers from Incyte got together at Jimmy & Elena's house in Fremont.  Lots of good food again and we played Mafia!  It was nice to see people I hadn't seen in a while and to catch up.    Alias!   I love  Alias !  But just when it's about to get good between Vaughn and Sydney, something always has to come up! It's ok though... eventually everything will work out - I hope!  I can't wait til the next new one in two weeks!    Tired   Seems like I'm always tired at work nowadays.  Any ideas to wake up, besides coffee?

						     Waiting   Still here at work, waiting for softball practice at 7:30pm. I'm playing with our company team and our league starts in three weeks, so we're practicing these next two weeks.  Should be fun =)    Bennifer   Last night, I went to see a free Alice 97.3 preview screening of  Jersey Girl .  It was actually a pretty good movie.  Great to see Ben Affleck getting back on his feet after J-Lo goes away.  The little girl was adorable, and she was probably the best actor in the whole movie.  Oh, and a lot of the scenes in NYC reminded me of when I was there, and I was missing it a little bit.    Gotta save!   We're gonna be on a tight budget these next couple months, and we gotta save save save.  No more luxuries for me.    No more casino nights   I always lose money when I go to casino nights (or casinos for that matter).  No more gambling for me, for a while.  Last Friday was Joey's birthday casino night and I lost $10 playing Texas Hold 'Em.  Where's this big phenomenon coming from anyway?  I had a much funner time playing at the fake-money Craps table! =)    My first official run   On Sunday, I finally ran my first run - the SJ Mercury News 5K.  I think I did ok for my first run - kept my pace of 12 mins/mile that I've been doing at the gym.  I finished in 36:28.  I stopped twice to walk for about a minute each and stopped at the water stations for a drink.  But it was fun! Hopefully I'll work up to doing a 10K!    Once you see it...   Heidi and I went to David's Bridal on Saturday since I made an appointment to try on wedding dresses there.  I tried on 5 dresses, but somehow none of them compared to the one I tried on at Bay Area Bridal - the ONE.  I guess once you see the dress you want, it's hard to change your mind.  I'm going back there this Saturday with my whole family, and probably gonna buy it then.

						     Weekend in Tahoe   This past weekend, I went to Tahoe with Alan's family for Audrey's 21st birthday!  Alan and I didn't snowboard since he hurt his knee, so instead we gambled.  And lost.  Oh well, it was fun anyway.  I think we had more fun at the Harvey's arcade where we played air hockey and this cool soccer table game.  And we won enough tickets (and found a lot too!) to purchase our grand prize of a travel Connect 4.    On Saturday night, we got dressed to go to the club at Harrah's called Altitude, but there was a long line and it wasn't free for women anymore, so we gambled instead.  Audrey had beginners luck and won a lot of money that night, playing Blackjack at Wild Bill's and Roulette and Pai Gow Poker at Horizon! Good job Auds!  Sunday we went to Mass and then ate a late lunch at the Harrah's buffet.  It was sooooo good.  I had lots of shrimp cocktail and crab legs, fish, fruits and veggies, and peach pie a la mode.  Fun weekend!    Free Alice 97.3 movie screening   I won tickets (on the radio, again) for a free preview screening of the new Jim Carrey movie - Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind - at the AMC Van Ness last night.  I picked Dale up from work and met up with Shirley, Glendy, Gina, and Patrick.  We were in line, but some of them went to get food.  Before you know it, the line starts moving really fast, so Glendy and I go in first while Gina and Shirley waited for the guys.  The movie theater was already packed and the only available 6 seats in a row were in the second row.  So we put our stuff down to reserve them.  But the four still waiting outside got stopped and weren't let in right away! So I was sitting there by myself, trying to save 5 extra seats, while everyone was asking if those seats were taken and giving me dirty looks. Oh well.  It worked out ok, and they let them in since I was already saving seats.  It was a great movie, but too bad we missed the last 15-20 minutes!!  The reel stopped playing and they said they were having technical difficulties!  We all wanted to see what happened at the end, since it was the part that probably ties everything together.  I'm gonna have to either sneak in at the end and watch it, or wait for the DVD to come out =)

						     Softball!   I am gonna play with my company's softball team this year, and we had our first practice today at lunchtime!  It was so nice and sunny outside, that it felt good to be outside during lunch instead of eating at my desk.  We threw the softball around for a while and then practiced batting/fielding.  I suck at batting - I think I swung and missed about half the balls.  I think I need to go practice at the batting cages or something.  I played outfield and have to run after a whole bunch of balls.  So when I got back to work, I was really hot and tired.  But I had fun!    Plearn   Ever been to a Thai restaurant in Berkeley called Plearn on University?  Us girls went there on Wednesday night and I have to say that it was really good!  I had only been then once before for Gary's graduation dinner a long time ago.  I guess Johanna and Jane go there a lot, since they knew the waiters and they knew the good dishes.  I'm glad that a lot of restaurants have a wide variety vegetarian dishes these days, since I gave up meat for Lent.  But I still got to eat pretty well.... I had the mussels for an appetizers, pad thai with shrimp, sweet and sour shrimp, and for dessert -  fried bananas with ice cream and sticky rice with mango... Yum...    Weekend in Tahoe   I'm going up to Tahoe tonight with Alan and his family for Audrey's 21st birthday! We're not snowboarding since Alan hurt his knee, but I'm looking forward to gambling!! Craps table - here I come!  (and blackjack and pai gow poker too).    Have a nice weekend!

						     The Contract   Alan, my mom, and I went over to the Westin to look at the final contract.  We have until the 19th to look over it and sign it and put a deposit down.  I'm so happy with the package we got and the place!    The Dress   Afterwards, my mom and I went to try on some more dresses in Cupertino.  There's this one dress that I've been looking at in magazines and online, and they had it!  So I tried it on and I loved it!!!  One problem - it's way over my budget, not even including needed alterations.  I found another one that was within my budget and that was really nice too.  I made a follow-up appointment in two weeks to go back and choose, when both my sisters will be in town so they can help me decide.  After we tried on dresses, I went online and requested some quotes for the exact same dress from sellers online, and the price was more than 30% lower! And the suggested retail price was $100 less than at the store!! I guess the stores hike up the prices, but dang!  Can't they just be nice to brides-to-be?  My mom and I are going to try to get the price down from them.    The Invitations   Alan and I went to Party City to take a look at all the invitation binders that they have there, just to get an idea of what we want.  I found one layout/style that I liked, and we even saw a do-it-yourself kit that was similar to the one I liked.  It might be much cheaper to make them ourselves using a laser printer, but we'll see.    The Stress   As things progress as far as wedding planning, I'm finding that I'm starting to worry about things more, wondering how everything is going to turn out.    In other news...   What a great week for weather!!  It's the first time I've worn a skirt since last summer in New York.      Speaking of NYC...   I can't wait to go back in May for my graduation.  I miss the big city, Broadway shows, and the subways =)

						     Pottery Painting!   I went pottery painting on Saturday with a bunch of SCU girls at  urlLink Petroglyph  in San Jose.  I made a little blueish-teal candy dish that says 'Olivia's Candy' and has a little strawberry stamp on it.  It was fun painting!  Shirley just picked them up and they look so much better glazed and shiny!  Thanks Shirley for planning the girls' outing!    SCU PCN   We watched Santa Clara's PCN that night.  Audrey was one of the moms in the skit and she was also in a lot of dances.  I think it was the longest PCN I've ever been to, but it was good.  They did this one Spanish dance that I remember doing back at Cal.  Also Singkil and Tinikling... brought back good memories of when I was in college.    First Communion   Alan's niece received her first communion on Sunday, and we went to the mass at Convent of the Sacred Heart.  The all girls school is soooo nice inside, it's like a huge mansion.  We had brunch afterwards at the Carnelian Room in SF, where she gave her first toast!  We had prime rib, creme brulee, and mimosas! Yummm.    Softball loss   We lost our softball game yesterday, but it was a good game.  I like playing at second, but I need to work on the grounders that come straight at me really hard.  I still get a little scared that it'll take a weird hop and hit me right in the face.  Alan bought me a new bat and I tried it out at the game!  I love it, Thanks Alan!  Now I have my own bat that I can use consistently... and for when I go to the batting cages (which I hope will be soon, cuz I suck at batting.)

						     Slacker   I get 'blog slacker' from someone (ahem... Beverly) after a week of not blogging.  But I guess it's ok... :) I'm blogging now!    Regina & Gary's Wedding   Regina's wedding was this past Saturday! She's one of my oldest and dearest friends (since the 7th grade SF city-wide spelling bee, then SI, then Cal). She moved away to UCSD for med school, but we hung out a lot these past few months, bonding about wedding stuff =)  The wedding was so nice, I cried when she started walking down the aisle.  The reception was at the Far East Cafe in downtown SF Chinatown... really nice red decor and cool TVs all over the place that showed the whole wedding as it was going on.  Had fun dancing and seeing old high school friends!      FOCCUS test   Alan and I went to Santa Clara to take the FOCCUS (Facilitating Open Couple Communication, Understanding, and Study) test.  About 200+ statements about different aspects of marriage, finances, children, personal habits) that you answer agree, disagree, or uncertain.  A lot things we haven't talked about yet, so it was good to put them out there.  We discuss our answers during our marriage prep workshop in September, but we already started talking about it.    Giants in a slump   What's going on with my team?! They're losing so many games and they're below 0.500!  At least Bonds is increasing his HR number, but we need to win too!    Great weather!   What great weather today!  I had a good time eating lunch outside, in the sunshine, in front of our nice water fountain.  Very very relaxing.  This weekend is supposed to be nice too, so make it a good one! Have a nice weekend!

						     Our first softball win of the season!   Tuesday night we won our softball game!  It was a pretty good game and I had a couple plays on defense.  I play second base and it's pretty exciting playing in the infield.  But I really need to work on my batting.  I can't seem to hit the ball straight on.  Maybe I'll go to the batting cages at Malibu with Alan.  Where else are there batting cages?    Hospital?   Alan came to visit my work before the game and he said it looked like a hospital!  But I'm glad he got to see where I work.  And we cheered for me in the stands during the game! Thanks 'barling'! hehehe. (inside joke)    Bon Voyage!   Last night, Johanna had a going away party at Betelnut in Marina district of San Francisco.  The food was soooo good and we got so much of it.  It was different kinds of Asian foods, like lettuce wraps, Korean BBQ pork, Thai noodles, dumplings, short ribs, garlic green beans, calamari, and of course.... drinks.  I got the Betel Juice (pronounced like the movie), Alan got the Sake Colada.     After dinner we walked over to Gravity bar, waited in line, finally got in, but it was totally packed!  We could hardly move, I felt like a cow being rounded up.  So we left quickly and just walked around, and ended up just getting donuts.    TGIF!   Work has been so busy lately... I hardly have time to eat lunch... But I'm looking forward to the weekend - to catch up on sleep!  And go to Regina's wedding!! =)

						     Bonds' 660!   Barry Bonds just hit home run #660 at the game at SBC Park, tying Willie Mays for 3rd place! I'm listening to it right now on the radio at work.... I wish I was at home watching the game... or better yet... at the park!   Can't wait to see the highlights.

						     First softball game!   We had our first softball game of the season on Tuesday.  It was a pretty good game... we were in the lead for a little while and almost made a comeback in the last inning.  But we lost by one!   Hopefully we'll win at least some games this season.  Even if we don't, we have cool t-shirts nonetheless.  Go Blue Genes!     I love refunds!   I just checked my bank account online and my federal tax refund got direct deposited today! WooHoo!  More $$!    Bridal magazines   Last night, I went over to my high school friend's house in SSF and she gave me a whole big stack of bridal magazines.  She's getting married next weekend, so she doesn't need them anymore... I can look through them and see if I like any of the bridesmaids dresses, which is next on my to-do list for the wedding.

						     They're baaaaack!   The Giants are back! And what a way to start the season! Bonds gets his 559th homer to tie the game 4-4 in the eighth inning, and then we go on to win the season opener 5-4!  I love the Giants!!!  Can't wait to go to Pac Bell Park.... errr.... I mean SBC Park for a live game!    Baby shower   We went to Mark and Diana's baby shower on Saturday.  Lots of fun games - the clothespin game where you can't say 'baby', baby animal name game, name the kids on the TV shows game, gift bingo, and dress the baby bear.  I loved their party favors - they had a little area set up like sweet factory with jars of different candies and we got to fill our bags.  My favorite - the sour power strips!  yummy!    Happy 30th Birthday Beverly!   And congrats to you and Gary on your good news =)

						     New phone   Oh yeah! Alan and I got new cell phones at the AT&T store, since we switched over and got a family plan.  600 anytime minutes, unlimited mobile to mobile, unlimited nights and weekends.  It's a pretty good deal and we got really cool phones - the Nokia 3200.  It has a color screen, a camera, a flashlight built in, and other cool stuff.  Plus for the first month, we get to download as much as we want.  I've already downloaded ringtones like JT, Britney, Dido, etc.  It's fun!    Radio crazy   I played the SAT test again on Friday on Alice 97.3 and I won 2 WOW cards to Great America (season pass).   And yesterday morning, I played the 'Andrew "I Don't Even Know" Game' and I got 500 everyday rewards points!  I called in at around 8:45am and they put you on hold for like the longest time before you play the game.  I sat in my parking lot until around 9:15 when I played and won!  I had to guess the category based on the clues - if you get it on the first clue you get 500; if it takes you more than one, you get 250.  I got it on the first clue... the clue was - 'Meredith Vieira'.  Any guesses on the category?    April Fool's!   Happy April Fool's Day!  Have you gotten fooled yet?  I kinda have - indirectly.   They played a trick on Sarah (the morning show host on Alice) and it kinda tricked me too....  They pretended that one of the online personalities Hooman, and Sarah got all worried (and I was kinda worried too), but it turned out to be a joke on her!  It was really funny this morning.  I was laughing outloud.    Can you tell that I'm a part of "Generation Alice"?   I even requested some songs to be played!  I listen to the radio too much, I guess... but it's only b/c I'm in my car a lot.... except when I'm at work or at home...  ok ok fine. I love Alice 97.3!

						     Rear end   I got rear-ended (again!) last night in Foster City... I was driving home from work and I decided to pass by the new 99 Ranch store in Foster City before going to the gym.  After going to 99 Ranch, I was patiently waiting at a stoplight and then wham! an old lady hit my car from behind in her 96 Civic.  So we pulled over to the gas station and I got all her info.   My car wasn't too bad... it wasn't even dented at the place where she hit me... her license plate imprint is on my bumper and there are a few scratches on the paint, so it wasn't too bad.  But I think my neck is starting to feel sore...    99 Ranch deals!   It's the grand opening of the Foster City store, and I went crazy buying a few things... like my favorite Thai Iced Tea in a small glass orange bottle.  I got a whole box of 24 of them, since they were on sale.  Also, 6 packs of Philippine Dried Mango, 2 packs of Haw Flakes, and 2 pineapple buns.  Since I spent $25+, I got a free jug of corn oil too :)    One more week!   One more week until the Camp Pendleton Mud Run.  I guess you can say I haven't been training, and Alan is really worried that I'm not gonna make it.  We'll see how it goes... I probably should go to the gym today, since I didn't make it there yesterday.    Have a good LONG weekend!

						     The Day After Tomorrow   Alan and I saw a free preview at the Metreon tonight of  The Day After Tomorrow  with Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, and that Japanese girl from  Karate Kid Part II  (I recognized her right away!).  The movie had some good special effects, with all the water covering New York City and everything freezing up (including the Statue of Liberty), tornadoes in LA (one that engulfed the famous HOLLYWOOD sign), golf-sized hailstones in Japan... Some parts were funny, some really cheesy.  Probably better to wait for this on to come out on DVD though.    Two movies in a row!?   I have another pass for a free movie preview tomorrow that I got from Alice 97.3 Everyday Rewards... Mandy Moore and Macaulay Culkin's new flick  Saved .  Not sure if I'm actually gonna go to this one yet. We'll see how I feel after work.

						     The Big Apple!   I'm back from my vacation to New York.  It was a great trip.  Here are some highlights:   Columbia Graduation Ceremonies:  Tuesday's Convocation (Arts & Sciences Master's) was inside the chapel.  I only got two tickets, but everyone ended up going inside since there was extra room.  Wednesday's Commencement (with the whole school) was on the steps of the main library and it was raining!!  Everyone had umbrellas and it was fun anyway, even though my gown got all wet.  Brownstone apartment:  The rental we found was great! It was like a mini two-story house with a kitchen, master bedroom/bath upstairs, room with bunks downstairs, and a sleeper sofa.  We got to order in and eat leftovers, cook breakfast and relax all together.  Broadway shows!  We saw three -  The Boy From Oz  with Hugh Jackman,  Bombay Dreams , and  Little Shop of Horrors  (Alan's favorite, since it was one of his childhood movies)  Live tapings:   The View  with P. Diddy, Frankie Muniz, and Tom Selleck, and  Who Wants To Be A Super Millionaire    Eats:   urlLink Serendipity ,  urlLink Monsoon ,  urlLink Acqua ,  urlLink Heartland Brewery ,  urlLink Gray's Papaya ,  urlLink Malaysia Grill , Ninth Avenue International Food Festival (and street fair!)  Shopping: H&M (twice!), Times Square shops, Fashion District (where I found fabric for my bridesmaids' dresses!)  It was a great vacation, and I was glad to be back in New York.  I probably won't go back for a long time...    Home Sweet Home   I'm starting to realize that every free minute that Alan and I have is probably gonna go towards working on the house or the wedding, mainly the house.  There's so much to do! But I'm excited =)  It's fun doing all this stuff!

						     San Diego weekend    This past weekend, my whole family met up in San Diego for Mother's Day and to see Heidi perform in the UCSD PCC (Pilipino Cultural Celebration).  It was fun seeing her onstage... she had a couple of extra parts in the skits - one was a flight attendant, and she was in Jota, which was the exact same one that I did at Cal.    We stayed at the La Jolla Hyatt and for Mother's Day, first we went swimming at the pool and then we went to lunch in downtown San Diego at this Brazilian place called Rei do Gado.  It was one of those places where waiters walk around with different kinds of meat on skewers and if you want it you ask them to slice a piece off.  It was really good!  Great weekend visiting H!     Next up - the Big Apple!   We're going to New York for my graduation ceremonies this week and I'm really excited to be going back. I can't wait to be in Times Square again, seeing Broadway shows, and eating at my favorite spots.  We got tickets for Live w/ Regis and Kelly and also The View.  Oh, and remember last year when I stood in line starting at 7am to buy tickets for Hugh Jackman's show and to meet him?  Yeah, well I got the tickets for this Saturday since I knew I'd be coming back this weekend for my graduation.  I can't believe how much time has passed.    The BIG THING!   It happens today!! I'll blog more about it later... :)

						     Food poisoned! :(    I think I got food poisoning on Monday somehow, since I woke up at like 1am, 3am and 5am throwing up.  I felt so sick on Tuesday, but I still went to work.  I was dizzy and light-headed, and couldn't eat anything solid, so I bought a banana, applesauce, and gatorade for lunch.  I left work early, got home at 6:30pm and went straight to sleep.  Today I felt a little better, but still a little bit sore and dizzy.  Still can't eat anything substantial - only crackers and applesauce today.  I feel like a baby when I eat applesauce.  It's so mushy.  Hopefully I'll get better by this weekend, since we're all going to San Diego for Heidi's Pilipino Cultural Celebration.    Can't wait for next week!   I'm taking 7 days off starting next Thursday since we're going to New York for my graduation and also for something else big.  Time has gone by so fast, I can't believe next week is almost here!  It'll be a good break from work!

						     Softball playoffs   Last night was my company team's playoff game against one of our fiercest competitors - not only in softball, but also with regards to what both our companies do.  And we pulled it out in the bottom of the last inning!  They tied it up in the top half, but we got a couple base hits, some walks, and we scored the winning run. 16-15!  I love winning.  Next week is the championship game, but since the team we're playing is not equally matched with all the other teams in our league(they should be in a better league), we'll probably lose.  But we'll see.  The win yesterday was our real 'championship' game anyway.    Give Blood, Save a Life   I donated blood today at lunchtime! It feels good to donate blood and know that it'll help someone out there.  I have lots of it, so why not give it away!  Last time I donated was in February.  I think I'm getting used to it now, except that it takes me a lot longer than some people to fill a whole bag.  Like this one lady walked in about 20 minutes after me, but she finished 5 minutes after me!  I guess my blood doesn't flow as quickly as others.

						     Revisiting the piano   I ordered the sheet music for  100 Years  by Five For Fighting, and I got it in the mail yesterday!  I tried to play it, and I spent over an hour practicing.  It felt good to play again.  I'm gonna master that piece, and maybe even memorize it :)  I wonder if I can sing and play at the same time....  I guess one thing at a time...  I listen to it at least 5 times a day on that link I posted before.  But now I can listen for the specific piano parts that I can't quite get when I play it myself...

						    A Walk To Remember  marathon   Driving home after work last night, I started feeling like I wanted to watch the movie  A Walk To Remember .  I think my train of thought went like this:  saw lotto million dollar sign -> thinking about how I'd spend the millions if I won -> thinking about things I'd buy for my family, Alan, his family -> thinking about Auds and Ben -> thinking about Ben's hospital bills -> reminded me of how Mandy Moore's character's home-care was paid for by Shane West character's dad.    Hmm... really random I know, but I love that movie!  And of course, it got me crying while I was watching.  I think I needed a good cry.  But then after that, I looked at the special features menu and they didn't have any short clips, just the whole movie with two different commentaries.  I was doing laundry and waiting for the clothes to be done, so I started the one with Mandy Moore, Shane West, and the director talking over the movie.  And I ended up watching the whole thing again :)   I think I want to read all the Nicholas Sparks books, and also see the new movie based on his book  The Notebook .

						     Eyes going bad   I went to the optometrist on Saturday morning, and she said my prescription changed -0.75 in each eye!  Gosh, I already had bad vision and now it's worse.  I can definitely attribute it to working in front of a computer screen for 8+ hours, without taking many breaks. She suggested I look away from the screen every fifteen minutes and take more breaks.  Fine by me! :)  Oh, and to wear my glasses to work sometimes... Don't know about that one, unless I get new ones.    Party Party Party   I went to a bridal shower on Saturday, where we ate good food, played games, and celebrated with the bride.  We built her 'dreamhouse' out of newspaper, and our team won!  We answered questions about the bride, she answered questions about the groom, played the clothespin game (couldn't say 'wedding', the groom's name,  couldn't cross our legs or flip our hair).  Yup, I lost that one when I crossed my legs.  Habit, I guess.  Sunday was my good friend Tanya's graduation party at her house in SF.  She got her Master's and now is going for a PhD!  She's so awesome!  I don't think I could take that many more years of school.  So much yummy food, and catching up with friends.    Engageds   Two other couples at Tan's party are engaged, and I was talking to the brides-to-be about wedding planning stuff.  I had fun talking about different ideas with them.  It's funny how my sets of friends are different: most of my friends from the SCU crew are married, none of the Berkeley crew are even thinking about this stuff, and a few others are engaged.  It's a different dynamic with each, and it's cool :)  Anyone else wanna chat about being engaged?  Ms. Luzon? YJmima? :)  I'm enjoying my engagement. It's going by so quick though.  Only 6 more months!

						     You better watch out, you better not cry...   ...you better not pout, I'm telling you why ...H&M is coming to town!     Yay! My favorite store in New York is coming to San Francisco!  I can't wait!  Thanks  urlLink Shirley  for the  urlLink link !    Yummy Thai food   Had lunch with Rex today in Alameda at this Thai place on Park Street, called Amarin Thai.  I had the Thai BBQ Pork, which was really really good.  I inhaled it (aka vacuuming my food).  Although it was good, it still doesn't beat Thai Basil's BBQ Pork in Durant Square in Berkeley.    Random   Anyone remember days of sleeping in, doing nothing, watching TV, and 'looking for jobs' while collecting unemployment checks?  How I miss those days... :)  Seems like a lot of people I know have collected unemployment.  Who hasn't these days?

						    urlLink      'Drrty Girls' after the 2004 Camp Pendleton Mud Run    The mud run was actually a fun time. It wasn't too hard (maybe it's b/c we walked a lot of it, and our team wasn't as hard-core as others.  It was good to have all of us girls together :)  Wanna see more  urlLink pics ?

						   Ok, so I got over the 'abandonment' thing on Monday. I'm better now thanks. :)    Giants are on top!   Finally, the Giants are in the lead in our division!  After a slow start, we're starting to get our rhythm back again. Beat LA! Beat LA! I hate the Dodgers. :)    Island BBQ   I had dinner with my friend Audrey last night at B. Padilla's Island BBQ on B Street in San Mateo.  I had the Honey BBQ ribs. Yum.  The place is run by Filipinos, and I actually remember my mom sent out an email about this place a while back, saying to go eat there to support them.  But I think I overheard one of the waiters say that that it was gonna close soon.    Josh Groban!   This past Sunday, all lawns seats for concerts at the Shoreline or Concord Pavilion were on sale for $20 (including fees and tax and parking).  I finally bought Josh Groban tix!! yay! I'm excited to see him sing.

						     Airports suck...   ...when you're the one being left behind.  Let's just say that after a whole weekend of being with your whole family, it sucks when you have to bring them to the airport and say goodbye.  I guess it's exciting for the people who are going off to a new place, but for me being left behind it sucks.    Abandonment   I'm feeling a weird sense of abandonment right now.  It's really weird.  And this weather isn't helping very much.  That's all for now.  I'll blog more later when I feel better :)

						     Pigs In A Blanket   Yesterday Heidi made some pigs-in-a-blanket and they were actually really good.  She made them with Vienna Sausages instead of regular hot dogs.  I easily gobbled down 5-6 of them.  Yum.    Middle aged?   The other night, I was watching TV with my dad and he started to mention how I should be careful and not do things that are risky, i.e. the mud run, because I'm getting older now.  Actually, he said that I wasn't a teenager and that I was 'middle-aged'.  When did 25 become 'middle-aged'?    To top it off, I was watching  Bridget Jones' Diary  and Heidi said that I liked it because that movie is for 'middle-aged' people.  I thought middle-aged was 30s?    Weekend plans   My whole family is back for Father's Day weekend, and we're gonna hang out.  Probably go to the new house and paint a little and then on Sunday have a Father's day lunch.  Happy Father's Day to all your dads!

						     Eventful weekend   I had a pretty busy weekend this past weekend!  Friday, we went to Loan's birthday party at her house in San Jose.  Really good food, and lots of it!  BBQ short ribs & chicken, spring rolls, fried chicken, salad, and lots more... and cake!  It was nice hanging out with friends, and we gathered all around our friend's newborn, little baby Tyler, since it was his first public outing.  Funny how people act differently around babies...  they become all sweet and mushy.    Rent-a-car   Saturday morning, I dropped off my car at Serramonte Body Shop to get it fixed from being rear-ended.  State Farm said they'd pay for a car rental, so I got one - the same exact one that I borrowed when I went to San Diego last weekend - a Chevy Cavalier.  But instead of the nice silver one I got before, this time I got a really bright red one.  It seems like I'm driving more slowly now, since I've heard that people in red cars get noticed by police more often.    Covad company picnic   Afterwards, Alan and I went to his company picnic at Baylands Park in Sunnyvale.  We got there really late - 1:15pm! - and it started at 11am.  When we got there, there was no more food, except for drinks and cookies!  We saw a sign that said - lunch will be served from 11:30-1pm.   We were sooo hungry.  Oh well.  We stayed to watch the picnic games, and we got some good ideas for our own annual picnics :)  And we watched the clown/pirate do a magic show for the kids.    Visiting Ben   After the picnic, we headed to Redwood City to visit Ben in the hospital.  I thought it was a great visit - he was awake for longer and he actually was interacting with us.  He even cracked a few smiles here and there, and made a couple of joking movements of his own.  It was really great to see him like that - same old Benji as before.  I'm glad he's getting better.    More birthdays   We went to Alan's high school friend's mom's birthday dinner right afterwards, where there was still a lot of Filipino food, so we chowed down.  And then right after that, we went to Jane's birthday dinner at Cha Cha Cha in the Mission district.  We waited about 1.5 hours to get seated, but we had lots of sangria in the meantime =)  For dinner, we had plantains, potatoes, jerk chicken, calamari, and of course.... the mussels, my favorite dish there!  Then we headed over to Monkey Club, where some old college friends were celebrating birthdays too.    Sunday - home day   Sunday, my family came over to our new home to visit.  The first time for all of them to see, so we gave them the tour. =)  They brought over some food for Goldilock's and we ate, while sitting around our TV watching the Giants game.  It was good to have people over.  We're gonna love hosting parties at our house =)   After they left, Alan and I went back to work, painting the walls.  We made some good progress, but there's lots more to go.  One day at a time...

						     Drrty Girls   That was the name of our team for the mud run!  We had a really good time doing the run - Johanna, Rowena, Eileen, Jane, and me - and we actually finished the race.... although it took us a while.  It was fun though - going through mud pits up to our knees, climbing over 5-foot walls with mud on both sides, crawling under ropes in the mud, going up a hill that was all mud, and running (or walking) up 'Suicide Hill' which seemed like a never-ending incline.  But it was fun, and I'm glad that we all stayed together.  Can't wait til next year!    Dick's Last Resort   For dinner, the Santa Clara crew went to this place in downtown San Diego's Gaslamp district called  urlLink Dick's Last Resort .  It was a ribs place, but the it was really fun b/c there was a live band inside and everyone was throwing stuff all over the place at everyone, like napkins and little wads of paper.  We started getting into it and started throwing things at other tables, but it was fun b/c you're supposed to do that there.  Pretty interesting place, I got a little tired of throwing stuff though, and of being thrown at while eating.    Rock Bottom   Went to this bar/club place called  urlLink Rock Bottom  down the street after that.    Only $5 cover and good music.  The Berkeley crew showed up too, so it was fun with everyone there.    Moving Out   On Sunday, Alan and I split from the rest and went to UCSD to help Heidi start moving out of the dorms.  We ate lunch at this really good Thai place in La Jolla called  urlLink Royal Thai Cuisine , and then went to rent storage space for all her stuff over the summer.  She rented a 5'x5' closet, so we went back to the dorms to get the heavy stuff, like her fridge, microwave, boxes of books, keyboard, and her 2 TVs.  I think she moved the rest of her stuff yesterday.  Can't believe her first year of college is over.    Benji   Yesterday, Alan and I visited Ben at the hospital since he was moved to a closer location.  He looked really good physically - he was moving around a lot and his face wasn't swollen anymore.  I think he recognized Alan - when his mom asked him if he remembered Alan, he nodded his head.  He didn't talk at all though, and he looked sad or frustrated.  We didn't stay for long, just stopped by to say hi.  It was good to see him doing better.  He even raised his hand to say bye when we left.

						     My new favorite song   I love Five For Fighting's new song  100 Years .  Kinda puts our mortality in perspective and makes me realize we only have just about 100 years in life and it can go by so quickly.  I just went  urlLink here  to watch the video, and the video is awesome too.  I love the piano, and I wanna go find the sheet music to learn to play it.  Check out this cool  urlLink site  that goes along with the song!  I like the different icons that go along with different time periods in your life, and how you begin in a rocking chair and end up in one too.    Praying for Ben   I'm still praying for  urlLink Ben  to get better.  Keep him in your prayers too.  We all thank God that Audrey is ok.     Mud run   We're all going down to San Diego for the Camp Pendleton Mud Run.  Hopefully it goes well and I make it through the whole thing!    Have a good weekend!

						     Construction right outside my window    "Bring your plank out here!" That's what I hear (and other things) right outside my window. The construction that's going on is sort of distracting, so I'm blogging instead of working.     GYGO 5    Our fifth annual "Get Your Grub On" BBQ was this past Sunday, and it was great! The weather was nice (my back got sunburned!), lots of food, friends, and games! Alan and I made different colored flags this year, and each time had to make up their team name with the color they got... Let's see there was 'Yellow Jackets', 'Orange Crush', 'Blue Balls', 'Green Goblins', (I don't remember the purple team's name), and the winners ... 'Red Period'. Check out the  urlLink pics !   Afterwards, a couple of people came over to our house for the afterparty, where we ate some more and played Texas Hold 'Em. It seems like every time people come over, we play poker. :)     Adios Amigos    My good friends Eileen and Rick are moving out of the bay area, so we had a little going away party on Tuesday night. We ate lots of stuff out of Jane's freezer, and went to the infamous Taco Truck that they always go to on International and 22nd in Oakland. Yummy tacos for $1 each. Then we went back to Jane &amp; Oscar's and Oscar, who just took bartending lessons, made us lots of drinks. Played Texas Hold 'Em again (see the pattern here?) and had fun, and even watched an old Berkeley PCN. It's fun reminiscing.     Wedding planning    Alan and I have finally gotten around to start doing more stuff for the wedding... met with our priest, met with a couple of photographers, made an appointment with a florist, emailed some videographers. Only about 5 more months! Plus my mom's getting a lot of stuff in the Philippines, so I think we're good.

						     It's here!   My wedding dress&nbsp;is here!&nbsp; They said I have 30 days to pick it up, but&nbsp;I think I'll let the store keep it for a while so I don't have to store it at my house.&nbsp; I'm excited to see it.&nbsp; I hope it fits.&nbsp; Time to start working out my arms&nbsp; :)    Meet with the priest   Alan and I met with our priest last night, and went over some of the basic things that we need to do.&nbsp; We both had to fill out this form (in separate rooms, so we couldn't compare answers), and when he was looking over it with us, I felt like we were in grade school again and getting our tests graded or something.&nbsp; We both answered '5 years' for the question how long have you known each other, which seemed to impress him.&nbsp; Also, that we're both willing to have kids.  He gave us a booklet of all the different readings and prayers that we could have in our liturgical celebration.&nbsp; I'm glad there are so many options.&nbsp; I already know which one I want for the second reading.&nbsp; (can anyone guess? it's been my&nbsp;favorite reading in the Bible for a long time now).&nbsp; And for the vows - we have to decide whether to use the traditional one that ends in 'until death do us part' or another one that ends in 'for all the days of my life'.&nbsp;&nbsp; I always wondered at other weddings how many options there were, and now I know.    DSL   Today SBC is supposed to turn on our DSL.&nbsp; I hope it works and isn't slow.    Goodbye July (almost)   Where did this month go? It went by so quickly!

						     Our first non-family guests!   Dale, Lisa, and Rex came over last night just to hang out and have dinner at our new place! They were our first non-family guests to see the house.&nbsp; It was fun sitting around our new kitchen table and just talking and catching up.&nbsp; Alan cooked some chow mein-like noodles and I fried some of the crab &amp; cream cheese wontons that I made last week.&nbsp; It's nice to host people :)&nbsp; Can't wait to get a couch so we can lounge in the family room. &nbsp;   AIDS Walk SF   Alan and I participated in the AIDS Walk in Golden Gate Park on Sunday.&nbsp; We weren't on a team - neither one of our companies had a team this year - so we just walked it for fun.&nbsp; We caught up with Eric, Marjorie, Oscar, and Jane, and we got lots of free food along the way and afterwards - chips, energy bars, ice cream, peanuts, and even boxed lunches from the Target/Mervyn's team (since they had a lot of extras).&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Sinugba and hot tub party   After the walk, Oscar, Jane, Alan and I went to eat at Sinugba near my house in Daly City, and then we jumped in my mom's new hot tub.&nbsp; It was really relaxing, especially after the walk.&nbsp; My knees hurt really badly after doing the walk, but the next day they were ok... I think it had to do with the fact that my shoes shrunk after I washed them, and also that I got a bad cramp in my leg the night before. &nbsp;   Bachelorette Party Bus   Friday night was my friend Nina's bachelorette party.&nbsp; We had dinner at Amici's pizza in San Mateo, and the party bus picked us up at around 9:30pm.&nbsp; We hit 3 clubs - Suite 181, Velvet Lounge, and Club NV... I thought Velvet Lounge was the funnest - I think it's my favorite club in SF.&nbsp; It was fun taking the bachelorette out for a good night out with the girls :) &nbsp;

						     I miss my sisters! ...and Mom & Dad too :)   Heidi called me this morning at around 6:30am our time from the Philippines, and it was good to hear from her.  She said she has a bug bite infection and that her leg is really swollen.  I haven't seen my sisters in a long time, or talked to them too much since they're out of the country... I miss them!  I pulled this up from an email that Heidi sent to me before.   I modified it to fit three sisters instead of two... :)  Click  urlLink here !    Building our furniture repertoire   We got our fridge installed on Sunday, and so we finally went grocery shopping for real stuff.  We went to the Asian market to get some meats and then Food Maxx for other groceries, including orange juice (which I've been dying for) and milk.  On Monday, we picked up our new kitchen table and chairs from the wherehouse, where it was all in boxes.  We got a good deal for a nice table and 8 chairs, but the catch was that we had to assemble it ourselves!  So after work, we unpacked all the boxes and started assembling.  The first chair was the hardest because we were just learning, but after that, it was a breeze!  Plus I think working on things for the house gives us a sense of ownership and accomplishment  when it's done :)  I love our new table!  Next up -- finding a couch!

						     Championship game loss   Tuesday night we had our championship game in softball against by far the best team in the league. I mean... they shouldn't even be in our league.  Anyway, needless to say we lost, but I had a personal victory - my real base hit ever :)   None of these slow rollers near home plate, or fielder's choices where although I didn't get out someone else did.... but a real hit, where it dropped in the outfield.  It was a little bloop to shallow left center, but it was a hit! yay :)    Quick week, but TGIF!   This week went by so quickly.  But I'm glad it's Friday! Tomorrow Alan and I have an appointment with a wedding photographer, and then we have a 'Natural Family Planning' seminar, which is required to get married at the Mission.  Then probably do more stuff with the house this weekend.  Oooh. Our fridge gets delivered on Sunday! Now we can have real food :)    Have a good weekend!   Back to the five-day work week next week.... darn :)

						     3rd of July BBQ   Saturday we went over to Johanna's house in Danville for a BBQ with the Berkeley crew.  Was really hot, had some good BBQ skewers, pork chops, chicken, spinach dip and sangria! Then we went swimming at her community pool... Nice and refreshing.  I can't wait for our's to be done, so we can swim there too.    4th of July - Home stuff!   Worked on the house, installed our new ceiling fan and other stuff.  The house is really coming along nicely.      5th of July BBQ   On Monday, Alan's family planned a BBQ which ended up being at our house.  BBQ'd some ribs, Korean short ribs, and hot dogs.  Alan's parents made a lot of other food and brought it over.  Ben and his family came over too, which was nice.  It was good to see Ben walking around again and even playing Texas Hold 'Em.  We played a full table of 8 players and Ben's little sister won the whole thing.  Then we played Upwords (similar to Scrabble, but you can build words by putting other letters on top of previous ones) and Cranium guys-vs-girls.  Of course, the girls won :)    SBC DSL or Comcast Cable?   We realize we need some sort of internet connection at our house, so we signed up for a phone line through SBC thinking we're gonna get DSL.  We were getting free cable already (we just plugged in the cable and it worked) so we figured why not let it last as long as we can.  But once I plugged in the tv connection in the master bedroom, we lost it.  I guess they caught on to us.  So now we're thinking if we get Comcast Cable TV, we could get cable for our internet.  Any opinions either way?

						     Slowest afternoon ever   Time has passed sooo slowly this afternoon.  Probably because I can't wait for the long weekend to start.  I feel so lazy, I don't want to do any more work.    Weekend plans   BBQ on Saturday, BBQ on Sunday, home shopping on Monday.  Can't wait to see if we find any good deals on things we need for the house.  And boy do we need a lot of things.    Happy  Fourth  of  July !

						     Awoken by the pounding of a garbage truck   I woke up this morning because I heard the sound of the garbage truck in front of my house. I totally forgot to bring out the garbage can this morning, and it was too late when I got up. Well, I didn't really forget... I was gonna get up early to bring it out, since they usually don't pick up until after I leave for work.  But this week they were really early. Darn. Oh well. Not too much trash this week anyway.    Wedding Updates   Photography/Videography/Florist: I've spent all week trying to find a good, but affordable photographer. I've emailed about 20 different people and there are some prospects. I hope we find one soon! At least we already have a videographer, and I'm going to call the florist we met with and confirm with her today.  Invitations: I went to look at some invitations last night and there were a few that I liked. Kinda want something different than normal, but not too expensive. Custom-made would be nice, if they were less expensive.   We're on a budget here!  Details: I'm starting to think about the details - like floral arrangements, place cards, favors, music during dinner, first dance song, music during dancing, music during the mass, readings during the mass, programs, decorating the church, decorating the reception, how I want my hair, the honeymoon plans, when the bridal shower(s) should be, when the bachelorette party should be, etc etc etc. I guess there's a lot to think about... We went to our friends' wedding this past Saturday, and I was observing all the details. I think that's how I started thinking about everything.  My life is slowly being consumed by wedding planning, but it's fun! I'm going to pick up my dress next weekend with Kitchie! yay :)
