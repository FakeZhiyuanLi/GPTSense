       basic baby hat pattern  1.knit a swatch. Multiply the # of stitchs per inch by the # of inches around the baby's head minus 2. Most baby's heads are about 17 inches, so you would multiply your stitches per inch by 15. round this number to the nearest multiple of 5.  2. cast on the number of stitches that you got as an answer for #1 3. join in the round. knit in stockinette stitch (knit every row) for 5 inches. 4. starting at the beginning of the round, knit three stitches, then k2tog. place a marker.repeat for the rest of the round. 5.knit another round, k2tog before each marker. repeat this until it becomes to small to knit on circular needles, then switch to double pointed needles. 6. knit until u have one or two stitches left on each needle, then thread the stiches on yarn (using a yarn needle) & pull through.  weave in lose ends YAY!! ur done!!~

       Cell Phone Cover   this is a cool case for your cell phone. i made it with "Super soft 3"(the brand is "lana moro"...i don't even know if they make that kind of yarn anymore because the ball i used was from a long time ago...but you can use any sport weight yarn...just check the gauge). you double the yarn, using two strands as if they were one. gauge:5 stitches per inch on size 11 needles in garter stitch. 1.with size 11 needles, cast on 10 stitches. 2.knit until piece measures 10 1/2 inches, or about twice the size of your cell phone.   3.reduce 1 stitch on each edge. 4. knit for 2 1/2 more inches.  5. bind off.  6. fold the bottom of the fabric up until the top is at where you reduced stitchs. sew the sides 2gether like this.   7. add velcro to the flap on top and the top of the main case.  8. yay!!! you have a spiffy new cell phone case! sorry if my directions are  confusing. if you need help, post a comment at this post and i'll try to explain it better.

         Hi! this is Cat, masqurading as Suki.  We are having trouble getting me as a member of the blog.   anywayz... look at this pretty panda hat I knit.  I just did the basic baby hat & added cute panda ears.  I'd give u the instructions 4 the ears but unfortunatly, i've forgotten them. So sorry :(                  I too am starting a cool knitting project once I get yarn.  I'm going to make a night-cap.  I just have to get yarn & figure out how to knit it.  Once I  figure it out or find a patturn, I'll tell u how...cuz everyone needs a night-cap.  :)  TTFN              -cat
