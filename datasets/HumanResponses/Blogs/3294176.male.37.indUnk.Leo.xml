      Well I found out today from Mike Roland at CompUSA that I won the CompUSA "BEAT THIS MOD CONTEST".    http://www.compusa.com/casemodcontest/  First prize is $10,000 USD...I was told that there were 2264 entries from around the world.  My PC is going to be in MaximumPC and there is an UNCONFIRMED rumor that it is going to be on the ScreenSavers show on TechTV.  Needless to say I am very happy that all that hard work paid off.  I should thank Victor Roberts for all his help and Rick Del Los Santos for the use of his digital camera.  Geno

      I saw on the news today that a man was beheaded on camera.  I can not even begin to imagine how afraid he must have been.  How much he must have missed home and loved ones.  I see all the moral outrage by this group or that group about the prisioners in Iraq.  Most are just using it for political milage.  I wonder why any group on earth would want to be part of a faith that yells God is great while beheading a bound 26 year old man.  Cowards all of them.  Why did it take five of them?  If It was the right thing to do then why did they hide behind masks?  At this point I must confess that I am tired of all of this war in Iraq crap.  Let those ignorant savages have it to themselves.  There are no innocent people there.  Let them live in the third world and be scorned by EVERY educated nation in the world.  Tell them we will no longer have a hand in what they do in their country.  We will no longer be buying your oil.  We will no longer be sending food or any kind of aid either.  When you have a problem...when your being oppressed too bad.  We will leave you alone.  Please leave us alone.  You win.  Your people are no longer alloud in our country.  No exceptions.    How long will they last?  WHO CARES!!  Geno

      As I mentioned in my profile one of the things I like to do is tinker with computers.  For me that means Hardware more than software.  I have modded computers for a "bit" now and am currently entered in the CompUSA "Beat This" modding contest.  The first prize is $10,000 cash.  I have made it to the finals...the last five of 2264 entries from around the country and around the world.  The results are supposed to be anounced any day now and I have my fingers crossed.  The case I built is themed after Valves soon to be released new game Half Life 2.  I wanted to include a few pictures but I do not know how to yet.  Soon I guess.  Wish me luck....

      A few months ago this rather large redish blond dog chased one of my wifes cats up a tree.  The intent wasn't evil...just a dog doing what dogs do.  We ran it off and got the cat down from the tree...much fun.  The next day the dog was back...this time dragging a rope about 8 feet long from it's neck.  As it was obviously in some distress we caught it...baby talk works every time...and removed the rope.    Now what?  Well the intent was to find it a good home.  As I said that was several months ago.  My wife insists that the new owner pay for having the dog fixed and for a 6 months supply of heart-worm prevenntion.  In other words a good home.  I have bathed the dog and taken her for some long walks.  She is sweet and happy and was named Ava...I bet you can see where this is going.  We have ( my wife has ) 6 cats and a dog...all in 3 different locations.  She shuttles them all to wherever they need to be.  Inside when it is going to rain...or when the day is hot.  Vet for this or that.  She feeds them all 2 or 3 times a day...does all the bath stuff and on and on and on.  I know she is overwhelemed with the added burden of Ava...and she still will soldier on till a "good" home comes along.  It is one of the things I really love about her.  One of the many things.  It is why I am not bothered by all the "stuff" that comes with living on a Farm...it feels that way somtimes.  Geno
