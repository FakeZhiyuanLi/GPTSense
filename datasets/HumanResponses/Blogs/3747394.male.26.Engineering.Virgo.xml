        Louise felt as if someone was following her.&nbsp; It was dark and the road was very quiet.&nbsp; She could not see anyone around and yet she felt sure that a person was following her, probably to harm her.&nbsp; How can it be?&nbsp; Ever since she has been living here, at the age of 15, she has always taken this route to home and never had any problems.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  "Could be just me thinking, it might not be a thing" she thought and continued walking in the cold night. ...

       Noor is a pretty and clever girl. She likes her friends who also love to be with her. Suha, her very best friend, and she sometimes sleep at each other's house.  They cook and study together. Today, Noor's father told her that they would have to leave for London because his sister is very sick and needs help.  She was first excited about the idea of going out to London, but then her mother told her that they might be settling in London, near her aunt, due to the situation in the country (Iraq).  Noor became so sad, she was so happy being in Iraq.  Her friends are great and funny, her teachers liked her and all her relatives lived over here. In London she won't have much friends, she will find it difficult to speak English, and also she hates her cousins there.  She remembers when they came to Iraq two years ago they made fun of her in front of strangers in the restaurant.  She can't look at their faces any more.   She laid in the bed and started crying.....

       "Have a nice holiday" Jane told her friends and "You too" they replied.  It has been nearly six months since she has been waiting for this moment.  In January her dad announced that they will go to Egypt for this years summer holidays.  She has been dreaming of the land of the Pharaohs ever since she was twelve years of age and this is a dream come true for her.  In one day she will be sixteen and will be three thousand miles away from her home land.  Little did she know of the journey they had to endure.

      Readers, it's up to you how to continue the story. No Guidelines.  Good luck.    Akhtar was standing on the bridge and looking at the horizon he said to himself:  "Will I ever come back to this wonderful town?"  It has been five years since he left the land he was born, the land of his childhood.  He wanted to become a civil engineer and so he did.  He can still hear his late grandfather telling him:  "Education is a great gift, take advantage of it.  However little lad, never forget your roots and keep seeking wisdom"  Since day one at the University, he has been missing his parents and his old friends.  Now he finds it hard to return back.  "I have made new friends and embraced new cultures.  This is the place I want to live in and yet I miss my old town so much.  It's so confusing."  As he watched the sun set he said to himself  "What lies ahead of the horizon for me?"

       He was walking down the street, looking at the windows, wondering what it might be behind them...  He saw an opened one and stopped a little to see what was going on. But he could not see anything inside, as the house was empty. He wondered why was it empty and why was the window opened? He knew that the owner of the house was outside the country for business and therefore took a closer look. "Oh my god, Maybe it was burgled" he thought. "Could it be? This man lives alone, he always has parties and I guess he's rich. Maybe he came back and took his stuffs. May be he moved into another house" He saw someone moving in, and decided to knock the door... After a while, he put his hands over the handle, and quietly... He opened the door. It was unlocked.  He was confused... Should he shout and see if there's anybody in, or go out to call the police and look like a completely jerk? It was hard to decide, but he chose to go in. "Any body there?" he shouted. Nobody answered but he heard some movement...

      To my readers  I am going to create a new page that will be called "And that's how the story goes on".  The idea is that every week (every Monday) I will add the first paragraph of a short story and you add your bit to the story.  The rule is simple, to continue the story as from the last post on the list.  Vulgar and any post that causes discrimination of any kinds will be removed.  Tell me what you think.  If I receive more than 5 positive comments I will start it.  You may leave suggestions as well.  Faisal ...

      Today, the 28th of June 2004, the Americans have handed over power to the Iraqi people. They will call it democracy. What kind of freedom is that when their government will not be able to have full control of their own country? It is a complete joke especially when their main income will be managed by the US. Let us remember that this government has been chosen by the invaders. They have promised election by next year (They promised the same in Afghanistan)   The US and UK claim to be the most democratic countries in the world. To be honest, I do not think there is democracy on earth (partial maybe). Over 2 million people in England marched to protest against the war in Iraq. On top of that, quite a few MPs of the leading party stepped up against this decision. Yet Tony Blair decided to go to war putting his faith on a dodgy dossier - We have to go to war because Saddam has weapons of mass destruction. Even if he had, war was not the solution. In the US some people's phone line are being tapped just because of their name and colour.   Give me a break.

      In April the BBC anounced the start of a writing competition.  The task was simple (or so you think), to complete one of eight stories by eight famous writer.  The entrants should not have published any works ever to be eligible.  As soon as the BBC released the incomplete stories on its website there were an amazing 250,000 download.  The deadline has now passed but there has been 17000 entries.  Great idea.   Link:  urlLink www.bbc.co.uk/endofstory

      The illois are people that has been removed from their land (Chagos Islands)in 1965 by the British and Americans.  Many of you do not know this because they are numbered by only a few thousands and does not create a global impact.  The point is this is complete injustice especially when you know the reason behind it: to build an American Air base on a so-called "British Territory".  In-fact only one of the island, Diego Garcia.  There is also something that you should know, all the animals on their island were killed using the holocaust gas.  These people live in poverty in Mauritius where the government have been fighting for their case.  In 2000 they won their case in the High Court in England but this does not resolve their problem.  Why?  Because the British Government (in 2004) has decided to go against the ruling of the court and keep these people out of their own land.  I think we should help these people and give them their human right.  I thought of posting this on the internet where a wider audience of people will be able to view it.  I await your response and thanks for Reading  Faisal ...

      Readers,  Please give your support for these innocent people who have been removed away from their land for nearly 40 years now (Read my first post).  The British Government are fighting against any compensation that needs given to them (and especially their land).  Add a comment here will be a first step.  Thanks

      One of my readers asked me to talk more about us Mauritians. So here we go:  Mauritius is a tiny island situated east of Madagascar (the large island next to South Africa). The economy is based on Sugar production, Textile and Tourism. Because of competition in the Sugar (with countries like Cuba for example) and Textile (countries like India, China, Bangladesh … where labour is cheap), the government has to find more ways to create new commerce. The latest attempt was the creation of a Cyber City. Basically, Mauritius is working towards being the leader in the IT and ICT industry within Africa. Personally I think that they need to do so much more because more and more intellectuals are moving away.  The population consist of (roughly) 55% Hindus, 35% Muslims, 8% African Christians, 1% Chinese and 1% White Christians. There are no racial tensions and in fact there is harmony. Two examples that can highlight this are: 1) Chicken is halal in every shops and takeaways. 2) Everyone understands the reasons behind each other's festival and participates in it (and Eid-Ul-Fitr is a public holiday). Like Mark Twain said: "God created Mauritius first then Paradise".  The Arabs first discovered Mauritius, unofficially, and never settled. It is referred as 'Dina Arobi' in their maps dated early 16th century. The Portuguese were the first to settle there and claims to be the first to discover the island in 1511. However they did not stay long because they could not see much interest in the island.  The Dutch were the first major settlers - 1598 - 1710. Most of the domestic animals were brought by them (Deer, cats, dogs, rats, …). They also introduced our main crop - the sugar cane.  The French then came in 1715. They developed the country and made it a very important place for commerce to such an extent that it was rivalling against the great East India Company - Mauritius was then called 'Isle de France'. The French brought us our way of life and even our spoken language. Part of our legal system is based upon the Napoleon law system (some have been abolished - like the capital punishment).  Unfortunately the French were at war with the British during that time. The French corsaire from Mauritius would use every opportunity to sink the British Trade Ships passing in the region and then collect the goods. The British fought and won the island and the French had to leave (1810). Mauritius, at that time, consisted of the Island itself, Rodrigues Island, the Chagos Islands and the Seychelles. Though the British had the islands, they did not really settle. However, they did contribute to the development of the island. They abolished slavery, added new laws and brought tea. Due to the abolition of slavery, there was a lack of labour working in the fields. So they had to lure some Indian labourers over there. (NB: When I came to the UK, I always get into this argument with Pakistani and Indian friends: "Which side of India were your ancestors from" - I do not know).  Fighting for Independence was not difficult but there was a hidden catch - has been the case with the other countries to which Britain gave independence (We got our independence in 1968). Until today Mauritius is not complete. They took the Chagos Island from us and create the "British Indian Ocean Territorial" State - one that is not even recognised by the United Nation. They illegally removed the Chagossians from their home and dumped them on the Mauritian main land. The Americans, who obtained the island on contractual basis for an army base, gased all their pets. These people fought and won their case through the British High Court but the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is currently fighting against the ruling (is he for real?). Mauritius is in process of bringing the case to the Hague and is prepared to leave the Common Wealth if required.  Any Mauritian reading this post, feel free to correct me and thanks for reading.
