      OMG! Just got back from seeing Troy with Briany and Sally. Brad Pitt is soooooo fit, all yummy and muscly and stuff. Orlando's fit too, but i didn't like him in the film, 'cos he was a meanie. Don't worry Orlando, we still luv you! xxxxx Oh, didn't see Joe but did bump into Tom. He's had a haircut and looks HOT! I'd like to 'bump' into him again hehehehe! I love study leave, it gives me the chance to go out and see all the cute guys! But yeah, i think i'm going to make it my mission to cheer miserable blog people up. If you wanna help, just let me know!  Nighty night, luv Hope xoxox

      Hmm, this is kinda scary, don't use the internet much. Hehehe, I'm a blog virgin! My photographer said that i should try making an online diary, 'cos he has one. I have such a lot to share with people, and my friends all say i should use my sunny personality to spread love to the world! Awwwwww, hehe, don't worry, i'm not a hippy- they're just dirty. Eeeeeeeuw. Still, i'm very into hot pants and tie-die :) Anyway, this is my 'blog', hope you enjoy reading it!  Luv Hope xxxxx

      OMG here, i'll just post part of this email i got this morning   GIRL TALK Did U no kissing is healthy Bananas are good for peroid pain Its good to cry Chicken soup actually makes you feel better 94% of boys would love it if you sent them flowers Lying is actually unhealthy Only apply mascara to your top lashes Its actually true, boys DO insult u when they like you! Its impossible to apply mascara with your mouth closed! 89% of guys want YOU to make the 1st move Chocolate will make you feel better! Most boys think its cute when you say the wrong thing. A good friend never judges. A good foundation will hide hickeys!..not that u have any Boys arent worth your tears We ALL love suprises!!     Now, just how cute is that? OMG, i love people SO much, every time i see stuff like this it reminds me that there is hope for humanity with people looking out for each other like this. OMG! How cool is that? 'Hope for humanity'!!!!! Well, that's what i'm calling my charity fun-run this year : )  Just thought i'd share that with you, and hope it warms you up like it did me  Hugz n' kisses, Hope

      OH  MY  GOD!  I can't believe that just happened! OMG, so I was like doing a photoshoot with my photographer, and i had to wear some reeeeally small skirts. So yeah, I noticed everyone was laughing, and looked down and my barbie knickers were showing!!! What was worse was that I invited chris to come and watch me do a photoshoot! Urgh, I felt terrible, but chris was so supportive. He is like THE best guy ever, I mean he's cute AND deep! I love him so much :-p xxxx  Luv and kisses, Hope xoxox

      Omg, hi everyone, i'm feeling pretty stressed out at the moment because i have a biology exam first thing tomorrow morning! I'm soooo nervous! I'd like to say xtra special gud luck to everyone else who will be doing it tomorrow! I think id also like to take this oppurtunity to give my views on something that came up in my mind yesterday, when i read one of my fellow bloggers blogs :) people are gonna think im being all like deep now hehe, but i suppose everyone has to have a deep moment now and again! but the point is i think drinking is like so bad. All the teenagers seem to be going out and drinking and i think its so sad! :( people should enjoy life for what it is really for, and not need to get drunk to cover up thier misery! So i'd like to say, to any of you guys who go out and get drunk, im always here to talk! Especially Dave, the guy whoose blog im talking about, i hope ur reading this! Anyway, im off now to get drink, a non alcoholic one! :P  luv hope xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

We watched it this morning in our PJs, and i just have to say that Picka chu or however you spell it is the sweetest thing ever! I just want to hug it all day long.

I'm off to buy the new pop hits 53 or whatever in town, plus maybe a trip to a few clothes shops; you know how it is girlfriends!  Loadsa luv, Hope xoxoxox

      Hiya all!!! Sorry i've already began neglecting my blog, i feel like sooo guilty, but i'm soo busy at the moment. ive got my modelling, which takes up loads of time and of course i need to keep in touch will allll my friends and go out etc and i have all the guys to keep in contact with too and then of course ive got exams coming up! Omg i'm soooo scared about them! But daddy says he thinks ill do really well so i hope hes right! I suppose ive always got my modelling if i fail them all! Thank god for clothes, shoes and good looks, eh girls!? Anyway, ive been so busy today, i got up really early because I was in a riding competition! I came away with three rosettes which im really pleased about- one for clear round and one for second place in the jump course (yay!) and then one for the prettiest horse! Aww, isnt that like so cute! So yeah, i was so happy when i got back, then mum took me out for lunch to celebrate which was so cool, and then while we were in town we bumped into Ash (this reeeally cute guy ive known for a while) so i introduced him to my mum and it was so cute! He got all embarrased and stuff! Then we went home and i called Briany and had a long girly chat about all kinds of secret stuff!! (shh now!) and then i did a bit of revising except i got a bit distracted by the music channel which was playing that new britney spears song which is soo sad! I almost cried when i heard it the first time! Hehe, love you Britney! Anyway it's like really late now, and i don't want to be tired tomorrow because im having Sally over for a sleepover and we'll be staying up really late! So bye bye, i'll try to write again soon!  Luv ya, hope xxxxxxxxx

      OMG! I completely forgot about my Blog. I'm not sure why i'm apologising, but i will anyway!  It's been a busy last few days, i was posing for some magazines. I met THE cutest guy, Will. I gave him the address for my blog, so if you're reading this then HI!!!!! What was great about these shoots was that i get to keep all the clothing! I have a gorgeous daybag and a baby blue crop top, which i fully intend to show off in town tonight! :-p  My bestest girlfriend Briany went to London the other day, and brought some friendship bracelets. So i'd like to say thank woo!!!!! to her :-p  Luv Hope  xxxxxx
