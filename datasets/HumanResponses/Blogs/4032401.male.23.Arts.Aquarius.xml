      Well I headlined at Rooster T Feathers Comedy Club in Sunnyvale, CA.  For those who don't know about Rooster's, it's a very nice club in Silicon Valley that caters to the Silicon Valley type, ie white and Indian.  This is perhaps one of the hardest clubs I've ever performed at.  For some reason, I do decent to well there, however, I don't KILL.  I hate not being able to KILL at a place.  And I can't figure the audience out.  They will laugh at stupid stuff and other comedians who are ok, but when I go up there they act like I'm going to rob them.  I don't want to call the audience stupid, but they should know that I would only rob them in the parking lot, not in the actual club where I'm trying to get work at.   I hate not being able to figure an audience out.  Usually you can feel them out and know if they want clean, dirty, political, sexual, racial, etc type of humor.  Well I decided that since it was a white audience to try and be clean with as little sexual humor and cussing as possible.  Other comedians before me did well and were alot more dirty than I was.  So I'm on stage and my first bit, which is one of my very best bits because it always does well, it's like one of my aces in my deck of cards, well it doesn't do very well.  I tend to tell stories that unfold and have punchlines throughout.  This place decides to wait till the very last punchline before deciding whether they will laugh or stare at you and make you feel like kicking them.  This is hard when you do long bits, because you rely on the laughter to build up to the end and keep momentum going.  Silence is not a very good confidence booster on stage.  Luckily, I get them going pretty well with my college material, weight bits, and disney and internet gangs.  The racial jokes for the most part do well, except for when I do a bit referring to white people being more likely to have incest, which I totally understand.  I do it more for my benefit then theirs.   What sucks the most is that I don't think the owner of the club stayed for any if not the first few minutes of my set.  I did this set in order for her to see me perform live and decide whether to book me or not.  If she only saw my bomb the first joke, then I'm done there.  I didn't see her after my set so I went home with my tail inbetween my legs (I have a really long butt).  I figure if she emails me and wants to book me then cool, and if not, then oh well.  This club's crowd may not be the crowd for me.  They seem to enjoy more of the, how should I put it, "White" comedians like Gary Shandling.  I think the only non-white comedian picture they had on the wall was Margeret Cho.   So I bid farewell to Rooster T Feathers and it's cracker-fest.  I guess I'll stick to the clubs that have that certain element I like to call minorities.  Actually, what gets me is that I usually do very well in front of white people.  Its just THESE white people who get don't get me :(  Maybe I should write more puns and analogy's for jokes so they can be pleased.  Actually I think I'm going to start focusing on my acting more than my comedy.  At least for now while I'm in the bay area.  For comedy I will do showcases to keep fresh and competitions and festivals.  As far as getting booked,  my main booker doesnt seem to want to book me anymore seeing as how I haven't heard from him in 2 months and can't get him to take or return my phone calls or emails.  Oh well, it's his loss...right?  *sniff* Please take me back booker.  Well acting is paying more than comedy ever will right now, so I'm happy as long as I got something good going on.  If you read this, sorry it wasn't very funny, I just felt like venting and I was trying to not cuss in case my mom reads it or something.

      Well today I wanted to talk about a couple of things: how my commercial shoot went and how my comedy show went last night.  For some reason, my body likes to mess with me.&nbsp; I think it's self-destructive, because whenever I get a big gig something happens.&nbsp; When I did my PlaysStation 2 commercial, the night before I started to lose my voice.&nbsp; I barely made it through the shoot with the little bit of voice I had.&nbsp; I had that deep, sexy voice, it was sexy except for every 2 minutes when I had to make that ugly clearing your throat noise.&nbsp; So I get booked on Friday for this Battlefront commercial that shoots on Monday.&nbsp; And out of nowhere this gigantic pimple erupts onto the side of my nose.&nbsp; This is my self-destructive body going to work, because I never get pimples on my nose, and never that big.&nbsp; This thing looked like a colony had formed.&nbsp; When I get pimples it's where my facial hair grows as a result of ingrown hairs.&nbsp; So I am freaking out because I can picture myself showing up and they look at my pimple and are like, yeah, we can't use you in the commercial with that thing on your face.&nbsp; But the shoot takes place at this ILM studio which is owned by LucasArts and does the special effects and art for hundreds of movies including Star Wars.&nbsp; So I'm thinking that they can CGI it off my face or make it turn into an ewok or something.&nbsp; Fortunately, this was a big time shoot, so they had a professional make-up artist there who went to work on it and miraculously made it disappear under 20 coats of makeup.&nbsp; So the pimple was handled.  Now the shoot was great, and the people from the ad agency and crew were awesome.&nbsp; It is amazing to see the crew create completely different sets between shots.&nbsp; Every scene was shot on a greenscreen so that they can add us into the actual Star Wars movie.&nbsp; The commercial is to show how realistic the game is to the movie and as a result you feel like you in the movie, so it has 6 of us normal people running in scenes from the movie.&nbsp; There will be 2 commercials made from the shoot and I'll either be running through snow after a stormtrooper or shooting in a jungle at some ewoks.&nbsp; It was some oscarworthy performances I must say.&nbsp; So it was&nbsp;a 12 hour shoot which means overtime and some extra cha-ching.&nbsp; I hate when actors talk about how they have 15 hour days on sets, etc and how its a lot of work.&nbsp; I did a 12 hour day and did probably 30 minutes of work at the beginning of the day and 10 minutes of work at the end of the day.&nbsp; In between I chilled and read magazines, took naps, played videogames, read the bible and the koran and then did a comparison essay, so much was accomplished.&nbsp; I love acting and would probably prefer to act than do comedy full-time.&nbsp; The money is a lot better and you get treated like a king as opposed to shit in comedy rooms.&nbsp;   Now last night I performed at the Avalon Club in Santa Clara as part of a comedy competition.&nbsp; This was the second and last week of the "Pre-Finals" stage.&nbsp; Yeah, have you ever heard of a competition with "PREFINALS".&nbsp; I haven't till now.&nbsp; The competition seems to have lasted about 6 months so it is good to finally be at the end.&nbsp; I killed that night and will be going to court later this month for first degree...hehehehehe...no.&nbsp; But I did do very well and placed first out of the five people selected to advance to the finals which will take place this upcoming Tuesday.&nbsp; Hopefully I win, because otherwise I'd be a loser.&nbsp; Plus the prize is $1,500 and thats a lot of pokemon cards I can buy with that kind of scratch.&nbsp; Scratch?&nbsp; I sound like I'm from the 50's.&nbsp; So, seeing as&nbsp;how the competition has been dragged out so long, I think that if I win the finals then they'll probably make me advance to the post finals or something.&nbsp;   Well tonight I will be headlining a showcase at Rooster T Feathers in Sunnyvale.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to it, because if I want to get booked there then I need to do well.&nbsp; When I sent the owner my tape she said that it wasn't very funny and she didn't hear many laughs.&nbsp; Which is crazy, because I personally dubbed in a laugh track.&nbsp; (It's hard to get an audience to come and watch you perform in your living room.)&nbsp; So once again I will have to jump through some hoops like the good little comedian I am and prove myself to people, club by club.&nbsp; With my luck there will be only 5 people in the audience and they'll be the waitresses wondering where the hell they went wrong in life to end up serving at a empty club on a wed night.&nbsp; I'll let you know how it goes...

      This is great.&nbsp; I finally have a blogger thing.&nbsp; Now all you people out there can really get to know me deeper than what you can get from my website.&nbsp; The first thing I want to talk about is my new commercial that I landed.&nbsp; It's for&nbsp;Star Wars: Battlefront, which I hear is a new videogame that will be coming out on PC, XBOX and PS2.&nbsp; I'm excited because it's a national commercial that will be played on Cable, Network and in foreign markets.&nbsp; Plus it's a funny commercial, which hopefully will mean more airtime and MONEY!&nbsp; This is my second national commercial in the past 2 months.&nbsp; My last commercial was for PS2 Online.&nbsp; The videogame industry is being very generous to me lately, which works for me since I've spent hundreds of dollars on videogames and PS2 stuff.&nbsp; So it's time I got my money back.  The audition for the commercial was great.&nbsp; I showed up and read the sides and it said that one of the characters was obviously out-of-shape, which is PC for obviously fat.&nbsp; I knew my chances of getting the commercial just went up 50%.&nbsp; Usually when I audition for stuff, I try and look as thin as possible, wearing loose shirts and blankets, etc.&nbsp; Having lost 50 pounds in the past year (Thank you ATKINS), I was worried that I would come across as too anorexic on camera with my 260+ pound body.&nbsp; So when I read the script I tore off my lose shirt and auditioned in my thin, belly hugging undershirt.&nbsp; And in auditions they make you do a profile shots where you face the camera then turn to the left and then the right, very similar to a prison line-up where they make you do your profiles.&nbsp; I don't know if they make everyone do this at an audition or if they did this especially for me to make me feel more at home.&nbsp; But as I did my profiles, I made sure to try and stick out my stomach to appear as much as Buddha as possible.&nbsp; Apparantly it worked because I landed the role later that week.  The only bad part is that I was suppose to go down to LA and perform at the Conga Room the same day as the commercial shoot (which is Monday, July 26th).&nbsp; The show is for consideration to be in this new documentary on latino stand up comedians, called "standUP".&nbsp; Unfortunately, I had to cancel.&nbsp; Hopefully I can reschedule for the following Monday.  Well this is my first Blog.&nbsp; I like this.&nbsp; I will try and post stuff alot and hopefully someone will eventually read it.

      So Murphy's Law hit me again. For those of you who don't know what Murphy's Law is, please turn off the computer and go get your GED.  So I had a commercial shoot this Saturday for CISCO Systems. And of course, Friday morning I get sick and throw up. Now, when I throw up, it's not a normal reguritating. I retch with all my might and so when I do, all of the capillaries in my forehead and around my eyes bust. So by the time I'm done, I look like a raccoon who has been beaten with a stick. Once again, before a shoot, whatever can go wrong does go wrong. Before my Playstation commercial, I began losing my voice and barely had enough to spout out the monologue. Before my Star Wars commercial, I got a huge pimple on my nose, a place I never get pimples.  So now I'm spending all of Friday with an Ice Mask on my face looking like a gay Zorro. I'm freaking out, because I can imagine showing up to the shoot and them looking at my face and telling me that I can't do the commercial, because they aren't advertising UGLY.  So Saturday morning I arrive on set at 10:30 AM. Fortunately a lot of the redness has gone down, but it's still visible. The costume designer, Christine, was awesome and relieved my fears by telling me that they have a make-up person to do make-up (duh, what else would they do with that title). I let out a big sigh of relief and a little fart, which made Christine giggle and then gag. The make-up artist caked a layer of make-up on my face and made me pretty. Having all that make-up on, I wish I had my gay Zorro ice mask, because I would have been a hit in San Francisco. I shouldn't have worried about my face though, because if Edward James Olmos can do acting with those huge acne potholes in his face, then they should be able to take care of little blemishes.  It was a long, hard day of work on the set. I got into my security costume and sat around for about 30 minutes. Then I spent 2 minutes signing contracts and then sat around for 30 more minutes, reading my FHM magazine, playing Gameboy, doing mathematical formulas and coming up with a cure for Cancer. I was then summoned onto set to do my first scene.  My first scene was very complicated and required true acting training. I stood behind the security desk and as another actress walked by and delivered her line, she looked at me when she said "security" and I nodded at her as she continued to walk by. Now to you people who aren't in the "biz," you probably think that this is an easy task. But you don't realize how many things I have to take into consideration while "acting". I have to develop a character. Am I a happy security guard or am I pissed off? Is it a polite nod, or is it a sexual nod? Do I nod and then continue to look outside or do I nod, lick my lips and then continue to stare at her as she walks away looking at her butt. See, acting is so complicated.  My next scene was a close up of me standing behind the security desk. This time I would spout out a few short lines and they will use one of them in the commerical. Some lines include "more security" "more voice" "more reliability" "more protection" "more inside". So I say these lines over and over using different inflections in my voice. One time I'll be like "more security" saying it like a question, and the next time I'll be saying "more security" as if I'm demanding it. It's great skill to do this and according to the crew, "I was brilliant" and "could use some deoderant".  So after about 30 minutes of shooting we wrap the scene and eat lunch which was Italian from a restuarant that I assume is Italian as well. I could have left after my scene, however, I never turn down a free meal because I'm cheap and poor...and Mexican, and we all know minorities don't turn down free food.  After lunch, I gathered my stuff and said my goodbye's. It was 12:30 pm. A whole 2 hour day of shooting. I love the life of an actor. In those two hours I'll make what I make in 2 weeks at my part-time job at the blood bank or in 20 hours of working as a rodeo clown.  So the commercial will be played live on the Cisco website on September 14th at 8:00 AM Pacific time. People world wide will be able to see me as a security guard. The website is  urlLink www.cisco.com/go/isr   You have to register on the site in order to view the wesbcast, which is free to register. So if you want to look at it, log on around 7:30 so you can register. The commercial is to advertise some big time product that Cisco is releasing. And that was my big day on the Cisco Commercial Shoot.

      So, I know that I said in my last post last week that I would write what happened in the Avalon Competition that I was in.  Well, I wanted to wait till I got paid before I said anything.  I got paid my $200 prize yesterday, so here it goes.  The Avalon Competition is a big piece of crooked crap.  I rocked the finals and it was obvious to everyone that I should have came in first place, second place at the very least.  On the "judges" scorecards, I was tied for first place with the other two comics who placed, yet somehow I mysteriously placed in third.  On the three scorecards, I came in first place on one, second place on another and third place on the last one.  That averages out to second place.  How the hell did I come in third you may ask?  Cuz the freakin competition is ghetto and poorly ran.  The owner of the club and host of the competition went in with the judges when told it was a tie and manipluated them into picking their two favorite comics.  After the show, when the host was talking to the three of us, the owner even came up and told the other two that they were his favorite comics and that he knew they would win when he first saw them perform.  Then this Indian douche looked at me and told me that he had never seen me perform till tonight.   Now I may sound bitter, but if hoping that a club and the owner become bankrupt and have to sell the ghetto club again to new management or that the club burns down to the ground is bitter, then call me bitter.  The owner even looks like a slimeball with his long greesy hair and attitude.  I hope he gets stuck in the worse part of Oakland during a riot, then he'll see how tough he really is in the real world.  And the host was horrible.  He sucks as a wannabe comedian and only hosts because he works for the club.  He is not funny, never starts the show on time and does wayyyy too much time in between comics.  He thinks he's funny, but he just annoys and pisses off everyone in the audience.  Ok, the problem I had with the competition is that they pick three random people from the audience to judge.  They put the fate of $1500 in the hands of three people who know nothing about comedy.  They have no idea which comedians are doing hack or original material.  They don't understand about comedic timing or creativity.  Would it be so hard to get three real judges who actually know something about comedy to judge?  Plus, audiences are stupid and lose objectivity.  The guy who goes last is the one that they all remember and if he does well, then they forget about those who went second or first.   So who won?  Surprise surprise, the guy who went last won.  The guy is a great guy, an old guy who audiences like because he's an old guy who talks about being old, smoking weed, etc etc.  *sarcasm coming up* It's funny though because he has great delivery and well it's funny to see old people talk about sex and weed I guess.  He is my nemesis because he beat me in another competition as well, where he performed last and the audience voted.  I wish I could hate him, but he's a nice guy.  He should have came in third place in my opinion.  The guy who came in second came out of nowhere.  People believed it would be between me, this other guy named Slappy and the guy who came in first.  Nobody had this guy ranked in the top three, except for the stupid judges and owner of the club.  This guy has a dating show on UPN that is pretty new.  His act consists mostly of impersonations.  I believe he ended with impersonations of Arnold Schwartznegger, Jack Nicholson, and Keanu Reeves.  Real original stuff ;)  *wink sarcastic wink*  but audiences love impersonations.  What can I say, you guys are monkeys and impersonations are like bananas cuz it doesn't require you to think.  Now dance monkeys dance.  I feel bad for Slappy, because he should have came in second or third at least, but ended up not even placing.  Of course, he won't say anything because he doesn't want to piss anyone off or burn bridges.  He even congratulated us on the SFComedy Board.  I on the other hand, don't care what bridges I burn in comedy, because there are no bridges in San Francisco, which is why I'm getting tired of having to deal with small time bookers and clubs who think they are big time.  If I had any bridges to burn, then I would be getting gigs and not wasting time in retarded competitions.  Plus this is my blog and I'll rant and rave about what I want since I know nobody but my homeboy in Iraq reads this because he does nothing else but sit on his ass and hide from his boss so he doesnt have to work.  Haha, be safe Kiyo and holla at ya boy!  So I am done with these whack, poorly ran competitions...  Well, actually I did enter another one yesterday.  I am now in the San Jose Improv Battle of the Bay competition.  I did a prelim yesterday and advanced to the quarterfinals.  Honestly, I could have cared less about this competition.  The only reason I did it was because they cancelled the Wednesday showcases there and I needed to get up and remind the guy who books the club who I am so that he'll continue booking me and remember to call me, since he hasn't called in quite awhile.  Fortunately, he caught my set and we talked afterwards and hopefully he'll call.  Otherwise I will continue to stalk him and put horse heads in his bed.  The prelims and quarterfinals are judged by the dreaded audience.  Therefore, whoever has the most friends in the audience wins.  Hence me coming in second place with zero friends in the audience and the guy who placed first being the guy who brought half the audience.  The guy who came in third brought the other half of the audience.  Both of them sucked of course, but what can you do.  My homeboy Tyson should have placed, but he doesn't have friends either and went up early so was forgotten by the end.  If I dont advance it is no big deal and I refuse to let any friends come to the show for the first two rounds when it's audience votes, because I want to advance through impressing strangers.  The semifinals and finals have real judges, so they can come then if they want.   What else is happening?  I will be joining the Screen Actors Guild this upcoming week.  A nice $1453 dent in my pocket.  I did get booked for an industrial film to be shot this Saturday for Cisco Systems, a computer company.  An industrial film are those horrible films that you watch when you get hired at a company.  All of the ones I've seen have terrible acting, so I'm not too worried about my performance.  The industrials I have seen are ones that are about sexual harrassment, etc.  Maybe I'll get lucky will be able to grab someone's ass or something.  I didn't even audition for the part, I was booked off of my headshot, so that was nice because I wasn't expecting it.  Of course my headshot was from when I was 18, so they will have a nice surprise when they see a 50 pound heavier version of me.  And I play a security guard.  I'm quite experienced in this role having worked 2 summers as a security before while in college.  So I guess my life has come full circle from security guard back to security guard (sigh) how sad.  Oh well, money is money and work is work.   Whew, i'm tired from this ranting.  I need to post more so that I can get it out as it happens and don't have it all bottled up.  Oh well, it gives you people something to read if your interested in my life.

      Well, today was a great day. I received two, count them TWO gig offers. The first gig was from my booker's company, GFI Entertainment, not Jimmy, who is my main booker, but his parter who does colleges called and offered me a gig in October at Chico State University.  Chico State has a special place in my heart because it was my very first paid college gig and my very first gig with GFI or any booker for that matter. It was the fall of 2001 and I was an emcee doing a show with Shang Forbes and Andrew Norelli, both of whom are good friends of mine now. It was a great show and I did well despite being nervous because this was my first big gig. I was even on the poster, which I thought was the tightest thing ever. My mexican side came out, because I stole a poster to bring home and still have it framed in my room (framing it must come from my white side). Plus I got paid $300 to do 15 minutes. So now I'm thinking, damn, comedy pays really well. This is my first gig and I'm already making $300/night. Of course, I quickly learned that most of my other gigs don't pay nearly this much. Most clubs, not all clubs, but most pay lousy.  They usually pay me in cheddar cheese and bubble gum.  It's the college and corporate gigs that pay the big dinero (that means money in Spanish, geez go to McDonalds sometime and learn some Spanish will ya).  Chico State is also a lot of fun. They have this reputation as a party school, and well...it's a well deserved reputation because they know how to have fun. And when you're out in Chico, CA, I guess there isn't much else to do but party and drink. Chico isn't going to be a big museum and arts place like SF unless all the cows start painting. So Chico is fun, I met alot of cool people there. It's always a nice place when white girls will come up and talk to me. Alot of times they get intimidated around me, or at least until I take my ski mask off.  I'm working on a parody of the Usher song Burn to do. Maybe I can get it polished and bust it out in Chico. Basically the song talks about Burning from Herpes.  The second phone call I received was from the San Diego Comedy Festival. They wanted to know if I would like to perform this week in it. Usually I would have jumped at this chance, because there is a lot of prize money at stake and one can never see too many donkey shows in Tijuana. However, this time I have to say no, because my little brother flies in tomorrow for the week, so I can't drag him down to San Diego. I have to stay here and make him dance for money at Pier 39 in SF. People love when I stand behind him and shout out "Dance monkey, Dance!" while he pops and locks.  But he gets a $1 burger after he puts in his 8 hours, so that should keep him happy.  But back to San Diego. They must be hurting for comedians, because I only sent in a registration. I didn't follow up with a press kit because they require a $25 fee and I didn't have $25 to spend. I think we can all agree that midget hookers aren't as cheap as they used to be. They are in high demand these days apparently. So they must be taking anyone, which sucks because that means the competition must not be as tough, making my chance at winning higher.  Tomorrow night is the finals of this Avalon Bay Area Competition that I'm in. I'll keep notes on the other comics and write up an evaluation of the night. It'll either be very positive or very negative, depending on if I win or not. There is $1500 at stake for first place, so I have to bust out the gut buster jokes...well i guess I should write some gut busters first so I can bust them out (HEHEHEHEHE) -imagine me squeeling like a little girl. I have some nice chuckle jokes and jokes that make you go "Ahh, that's very true. This gentleman on stage has a good point. Not funny, but true nonetheless. Where's the waitress? I'm could use another drink. Don't tell me I don't need another drink! You're not my mother!... Don't touch me. (burp) I have to go pee. I'll be back." (HEHEHEHEHEHE)
