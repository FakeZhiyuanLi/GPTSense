      As I journey through this world of Blogging, I can’t help notice these scripts called quizzes. When I was teaching, one of the activities that most students hate is quizzes. But now, as I browse the blogs of some of my students, a large number of them post quizzes on their sites. I inquired as to why they like these quizzes and most of them replied that these quizzes is sort of personal and delivers a result that they find amusing.  As I delved into this, I can’t help but ask myself, can I apply this approach to my students in school? If possible, how?  Here's a samples of what quizzes are available to be used in ones blog:        Your love is... by  urlLink  ChibiMarronchan        Your name is...           Your kiss is...    mysterious      Your hugs are...    to die for      Your eyes...    burn into my heart      Your touch is...    irresistable      Your smell is...    refreshing      Your smile is...    hypnotising      Your love is...    one of a kind               urlLink  Quiz created with MemeGen  !

      Still, I can’t put myself to really use this blog as a personal public viewed journal. I believe that a journal and its content should be private. I think a person who blogs is either a boastful person or a person who is just lazy to use a pen or, a person who’s penmanship is so bad that even he/she could not recognize his/her writing. In any case, each person has his/her own opinion about the matter and I should respect that even if I don’t like it.

      Almost everyone I know online is saying BLOG. What is it I ask and after reading a few from those I know, I learned that it’s an open journal; that almost everyone online can read. “But why, isn’t a journal supposed to be private?” I asked. Some say that they want their life to be an open book and others may say “well I don’t really post everything that happened.” Still, I am a bit off with this.  So in order to know more of this, I decided to make my own so I may experience and learn about this thing called blog. This will be something from what I do and I don’t know what will happen. Only time can tell.
