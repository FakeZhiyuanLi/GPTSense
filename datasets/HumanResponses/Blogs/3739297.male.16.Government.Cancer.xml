      Awwwww crap! Typed out a long post just now, then my computer blew out on me again. Haiz...lost everything. What a waste of time. I would just have to type everything out again.  We had our first PE of the term today. It was fun, even though all I did was run around and make a nuisance of myself. Personally, I would rather be playing basketball. :P   RCC had told us that he would be checking our holiday homework today. But did he do it? NOOOOOO...caused me to stay up till 1:30 last night all for nothing. RCC is such a great guy, really. So great that it makes me wish that i could just curl my hands around his puny neck and break it. But I can't do that, can i? Not when we are living in good old Singapore, where we can't even buy guns and go spray the streets in a killing spree. :P If only we were living in the States...The States is a nice place, no kidding.  Hmmmmmm, it appears that Rice Matters would be starting next week. For anyone going on Friday, we could met up and go over together. For those who are still in the dark, Rice Matters is a musical created by my school, GMSS. From what I've heard, it should be a nice play, so come along and buy a ticket. It only costs $15. I can assure you that you may have the time of your life there. (Keyword : May) :P  Oh right! Did i tell you that i would be taking my Chinese O lvl Oral on Friday? OK, i just did. :D Whatever. Anyway, its so close! And we would be having our listening Compre on Saturday...But looking on the bright side, i could get this whole mess over and done with quickly. lolz. Wish me luck.  Here is the quote of the day:  You did something because it had always been done, and the explanation was "but we've always done it this way." A million dead people can't have been wrong, can they?  -- (Terry Pratchett, The Fifth Elephant)  Its kind of true. Just think about it. We do this every year. One good example is the Chinese New Year, Christmas etc. Well whatever. Have to get back to doing my homework now. Till next time.

      Hello everyone. As i'm sure, most of you know that school is starting tomorrow. Oh dear......lolz. Ah, i guess that I should be happy about it. It would be nice to have some direction in life again, instead of hanging around all day playing games or listening to mp3s.  I just had a terrible wakeup call while working on my A math test today......I had always thought that my maths was good, but I was wrong. So what if i got 91% for my A math during my     Mid-Year? It doesn't mean anything. In fact, for such an easy paper, i'm surprised i didn't get full......It doesn't matter how well you are in your school. What matters is how good you are on the national level. I don't think that i would do well for the test......Arrgggghhhhhh...i've let everyone down.   Dear Alvin:                        You sux.                 Yours Sincerely,                Alvin.  Haiz......Anyway, here's your the quote of the day:  It's a sad and terrible thing that high-born folk really have thought that the servants would be totally fooled if spirits were put into decanters that were cunningly labelled backwards. And also throughout history the more politically conscious butler has taken it on trust, and with rather more justification, that his employers will not notice if the whisky is topped up with eniru.  -- (Terry Pratchett, Hogfather)  If you notice, all of the quotes are from Terry Pratchett. He is a great guy, really. Writes very funny books......You should try reading them someday...

      YAH! i've finally completed my versatile essays!Just about done with my English homework now......Just about done with everything now. :D  Haiz, life is getting more boring by the minute. Just can't find anything nice to do.Bored, Bored, Bored.Sianz. Read this:  The shortest unit of time in the multiverse is the New York Second, defined as the period of time between the traffic lights turning green and the cab behind you honking.  -- (Terry Pratchett, Lords and Ladies)  oh well, nothing to type anymore.lolz. Adios!

      Me and my buddies went eating at Seoul Garden today! Not a bad place, but a tad too expansive. Really not my cup of tea......But oh well, what's done is done!Besides, it was good to catch up with old friends. :D  Haiz....School is starting in two days, and i've not yet completed my homework. This is bad......i have been slacking so  much that my studies are taking a back seat! And we are taking our O lvl later this year...And I'm not ready yet!AARRGGHHHHH!!!!!  Oh well, got to get on with work now. Try reading this; its kind of funny......  It was funny how people were people everywhere you went, even if the people concerned weren't the people the people who made up the phrase "people are people everywhere" had traditionally thought of as people.  I will leave it at that.

      Haiz, had English and E math Mock Exam today. So sian...The English paper was quite tough, but I believe that I would be able to get at least a B4. Maybe. Hopefully. In all likelihood. *ahem* Anyway, the E math paper was kind of easy...Which is good, cuz I spent the whole Friday night gaming. lolz. Aren't I great? :D  After the papers, we took a class photo. Everyone all like don't want to take one...All just stand around. Then the girls started shouting and yelling and everything, and finally the dudes gave up and fell in line. Dear Jun Liang decided to help us take the picture, otherwise we would have a small problem on our hands. Of course, by this time we were supposed to be down at the AVT attending Ms Lam's bio lesson. She got really angry...Or as angry as she could get, which I don't think is a lot...She's quite the nice teacher, really. And she told us that Mr Adam Koo has decided to give us his special training or something to that extent. But it is not finalized yet, so don't go jumping for joy. It might or might not happen. So just cross your fingers, and prey that it does. :P  As of today, I would be talking about stuff from the occult. Here's the first issue of Alvin's Occult Compilation:  Species of Demons, as Described by Alphonse de Spina (1467) Fates, who alter destiny Poltergeists, who cause mischief Incubi and Succubi, who stimulate lust and perversion Marching Hordes, who bring about war Familiars, who assist witches Nightmares, who disturb sleep through bad  urlLink dreams  Demons formed from Human Semen Disguised Demons Demons who Assail the Saintly Demons who Instigate Witchcraft  (Thanks to  urlLink http://www.djmcadam.com/ )  And here is the quote of the day:  The Yen Buddhists are the richest religious sect in the universe. They hold that the accumulation of money is a great evil and a burden to the soul. They therefore, regardless of personal hazard, see it as their unpleasant duty to acquire as much as possible in order to reduce the risk to innocent people. -- (Terry Pratchett, Witches Abroad)  Okay, that's it. Been playing Ragnarok Online a lot lately, so if you see me online and talk to me, and I don't type back, don't get insulted or something. :P See you around.

      Another boring day at school...when will this ever end? Can't wait for school to be over...Well, nothing much happened today...Eric spent his entire lessons just trying to get us to understand this really tough question...And I'll be betting that more than half the class still doesn't know what he is talking about. lolz.   Nothing much to talk about...So here is another quote:  Ridcully was to management what King Herod was to the Bethlehem Playgroup Association. His mental approach to it could be visualised as a sort of business flowchart with, at the top, a circle entitled "Me, who does the telling" and, connected below it by a line, a large circle entitled "Everyone else". -- (Terry Pratchett, The Last Continent)  Yeah, whatever. Be seeing you.

      Hey people! Nothing of much interest&nbsp;happened today...Just like any other Mondays...Oh yeah, Mrs Lam didn't come, but that studpid Mr Lim just had to come over and take over her lessons. Add that to the fact that we ere to have another two periods of Physics later in the day, that makes three periods of Physics in a day! Its so boring...Really feel like sleeping...   Today, we had our audition for our teacher's day celebrations. I wonder how the teams are faring...In any case, all the best to everyone taking part! Just do your best. It does not matter if you are choosing or not, the important thing is to have fun. That sound like something an old person would&nbsp;tell you, doesn't it? I don't know, I find that it is a good philosophy to live by...   BTW, here is something interesting I've read...Hope you like it too:   "The seasons, in fact, teach us two lessons that both steady and chastise: all things must pass, and all things shall return. They tell us that every new beginning brings us closer to an end, and every elegy has withing it the echo (and the promise) of a future celebration. They say that love that seems eternal now may soon be a distant memory; and that a new love may come along to revive our sense of eternity. They teach us that suffering is inevitable, and in that inevitability is a constancy that helps take the edge off suffering. We cherish flowers more than evergreens, precisely because they do not last.   Season instruct us, then. In a subtler way of being; they initiate us into a process more universal than the New Year and more flexible than moons. All of us have our own calendars, and all of us think in terms of spring cleaning or fall fashions, But seasons induct us into a world of divisions that are never hard and fast (soft and slow, rather); they offer lessons about constancy and flux, and show us that there are some things- for all our fears of global warming and a nuclear winter- we cannot much affect. Seasons teach us about transitions, for winter elides into spring as gently as remorse into regret, or adolescence into youth. And just when we assume that winter is gone, an unseasonable blizzard will come down to remind us we were wrong."  There, that's it. Quite a long piece. Those Lit pupils should be able to understand it better, I suppose. Anyway, its time for the quote of the day:  People have believed for hundreds of years that newts in a well mean that the water's fresh and drinkable, and in all that time never asked themselves whether the newts got out to go to the lavatory. -- (Terry Pratchett, Reaper Man)  lolz. Nothing to type anymore. Till next time.

      Its been quite some time since I've last posted...Mostly I was too lazy or just too darn tired. Haiz...A lot of thing have happened during the past week...I would rather not say anything about it,&nbsp; else certain people might feel insulted...  Because of those events, Amie has beening feeling down in the dumps lately. How i wish that I have the guts to just talk to her...she looks so sad...So very different from her usual happy, shouting self. Glad to hear to she's gotten over it...I mean, she a great friend and all, always there when you need her...I just wish that we could be there when she needs us...  Anyway, I've came across a great song. It's by Steps and its called "It's the way you make me feel." here are the lyrics  It's the thing that you do So physical It's the thing that you say So flammable You know I can't resist Boy it's such a shame Do you belong to another  I don't wanna hurt nobody but my heart just can't hold back It's the way you make me feel (Make me feel , make me feel) Spinning my world around Tell me how can I walk away I don't care what they say I'm loving you anyway It's the way you make me feel I'm going to make you mine It's not impossible Got to let you know I'm irresistible Baby can't you see You're the one for me But you belong to another  I don't wanna hurt nobody But my heart just can't hold back It's the way you make me feel [ The way you make me feel ] Spinning my world around Tell me how can I walk away I don't care what they say I'm loving you anyway It's the way you make me feel (Make me feel , make me feel) (Make me feel , make me feel) When I look into your eyes  Everytime you smile at me Oh I go weak inside Baby I just can't hide my love It's the way you make me feel [ The way you make me feel ] Spinning my world around Tell me how can I walk away I don't care what they say I'm loving you anyway It's the way you make me feel (Make me feel , make me feel) (Make me feel , make me feel) Tell me how can I walk away I don't care what they say I'm loving you anyway It's the way you make me feel It's the way you make me feel  I will try to get the song up on my site...Yeah, that's about all. Bye.

      Ah...Appearently, Blogger has decided to add a few new functions to, as it were, Blogger. We are now able to upload pictures, use coloured text, add bullets, blah blah blah, and what have you.&nbsp; I expect to see more stuff from Blogger...it could very well have a bright future in the web industry.  &nbsp; Well, we had our Social Studies and Chemistry Mock Exam today. I should be able to pass my SS paper, and i hope to be able to score at least 30+ in my Chem paper. Right...Renee and Jon &nbsp;didn't come to school today...wonder what's wrong with them? To miss out on such an important thing...Moreover, Renee said that she would be coming...Haiz, don't know them lah. lolz. &nbsp; Right, I've forgotten talk about a very important/humourous event that happened on Wednesday.&nbsp; I was clearing out the bin as usual after class. The sun was shining down on me, the wind playing its little games with my hair, the birds were singing and flying gracefully in the air...In short, it was a perfect day! What was not perfect was that Victor and Jon Cho was having a blaw outside the class.&nbsp; Its the fight of the year! Jon has Victor in a deathgrip. Blam! Pow! Try as he might, Victor is unable to break free from the Ramboesque hold that Jon was using. "No way out," Victor thought."Looks like I would have to use my ultimate move - Hiten Mitsurugi Style, The Dragon's Rages!" And with that, he unleashed the innate power inside his body, and spun around in the air,&nbsp;causing his foot to move&nbsp;at exactly the right speed, occupy exactly postition in time and space, and processing exactly the right amount of force to bring the foot into sharp contect with the bin in my hand, thereby causing it to fly up into the air, spin around twice and land onto of Brenden's head. Right. *ahem* So, of course, Brenden was covered with&nbsp;dirt and drenched with the unknow liquid present in the bin. And of course Brenden went to the toliet to get cleaned up, and he got his shirt wetter than it already was in the process of getting it cleaned. Right. As it were. This whole event has nothing to do with me. lolz. Just doing my duty ~ keeping the class clean.&nbsp; *ahem* :P &nbsp; Ok, so now its time for the quote of the day: &nbsp; They say the heat and the flies here can drive a man insane. But you don't have to believe that, and nor does that bright mauve elephant that just cycled past.   -- (Terry Pratchett, The Last Continent) &nbsp; All that's all. Till next time. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      And another year has passed for Alvin, Sacker of Cities, The Final Grave of Hope. I'm one year older, in all likelihood wiser, and maybe smarter. Many people in class wished me a happy birthday...That really made my day, though i could have died under all the embarrassment. Love F4/2 lots.   It was another boring schoolday, daydreamed though everything...I wonder how I've managed to even get back home...lolz. During A Math lesson I was drawing away, not following the lesson. lolz.   Oh right...Yesterday, Mr Adam Khoo came to talk to us. He's a great guy, really animated and humourous...But I think that he is trying too hard, as if you listen carefully, you can hear that he is straining his voice. :P Oh well, since he is paid to do that, i suppose that it is alright. Hmmm, learnt quite a lot from that talk...  Anyway, here's another quote:  This is very similar to the suggestion put forward by the Quirmian philosopher Ventre, who said, "Possibly the gods exist, and possibly they do not. So why not believe in them in any case? If it's all true you'll go to a lovely place when you die, and if it isn't then you've lost nothing, right?" When he died he woke up in a circle of gods holding nasty-looking sticks and one of them said, "We're going to show you what we think of Mr Clever Dick in these parts..."  -- (Terry Pratchett, Hogfather)  Don't have anything much to write anyway. Signing off now.

      Ah, I was too tired to blog last night so here I am! We had our school musical yesterday. Its not bad, considering that this is the cast's first musical. The band played well, the cast show high levels of professionalism ( at least they didn't laugh when it came to a hugging scene), and the vocalist did an outstanding job. Who would have thought that GM would be able to come up with something like this? Certainly not me. :P   As for the people there, most of them were well behaved, except of a few lowlifes who kept talking during the show. I wouldn't have minded them, but they were not even making the effort to whisper. Of course, I would not take this lying down, so I hit them on the elbow and told them to shut up. That got did the trick. Finally we, the superior beings that we are, could enjoy the show in peace without the interference of sub-humans. :D  The guys told me to meet them at Raffles MRT at 5:15. So I got there at 5:15. The dudes were not there yet, or so I thought. Okay, that's alright. I could wait. And so I waited. And waited. And waited some more. The dudes still did not turn up. Eventually, I got tired of waiting, so I went over to the VCH myself. They weren't there too. lolz. To make a long story short, I've waited 2 hours in all before I've finally found them ( or your could say that it was the other way round. They found me.) And I've finally met the must esteemed cousin of Amie. She's one hot chick, I'd say. And Amie looked downright stunning that night. Its amazing what enough makeup can do to change one's image. And I've seen Jes and Amie's so-called boyfriend. *laughs* All in all, I've had a great time.  Now for the events of today. Nothing much happened, but Xin Yu, Zhao Qi and I went over to TM to buy a birthday present for yours truly and Zhao Qi. After which we took a trip over the E-Zone and had a gala time blasting away at the first person shooter games. Had a lot of fun.   And now, for the quote of the day! Here goes:  Supposing an emperor was persuaded to wear a new suit of clothes whose material was so fine that, to the common eye, the clothes weren't there. And suppose a little boy pointed out this fact in a loud, clear voice...  Then you have The Story of the Emperor Who Had No Clothes.   But if you knew a bit more, it would be The Story of the Boy Who Got a Well-Deserved Thrashing From his Dad for Being Rude to Royalty, and Was Locked Up.  Or The Story of the Whole Crowd Who Were Rounded up by Guards and Told "This Didn't Happen, OK? Does Anyone Want to Argue?"   Or it could be a story of how a whole kingdom suddenly saw the benefits of the 'new clothes', and developed an enthusiasm for healthy sports* in a lively and refreshing atmosphere which got many new adherents every year, and led to a recession caused by the collapse of the conventional clothing industry.   It could even be a story about The Great Pneumonia Epidemic of '09.  It all depends on how much you know.   -- (Terry Pratchett, Thief Of Time)  All right, so this is quite long for a quote, but it sure is funny. I don't know about you, but i find it funny. lolz. Oh well, till next time.  *Mostly involving big, big beachballs.

      Another day has come and gone! And now we are one day older. One day wiser. One day less to live. How I wish that we would never have to grow old. But, you know the old saying:  If wishes were fish, there would be no room for the water.    It was another productive day at Alvinville! First, i wasted the entire E Math lesson away by doing what I do best - slacking and daydreaming! For Chinese today, we went down to the AVT to watch this old movie that's even more long winded than all those Taiwanese sitcoms that you see on TV. Almost feel asleep watching it. Borriinngggg......But it has its nice points. It prevents the teachers from really giving us a proper Chinese lesson, and we get to watch a movie! Abiet a boring one, but a movie nevertheless. :P  Took my Chem test today too. Passing shouldn't be a problem, but scoring well is another thing all together. lolz Man, I've should have studied harder......Been slacking too much liao. lolz. BTW, Rice Matters is tml! I wonder how good - or bad- it would be. Just can't wait for tml.   Anyway, here is another quote:  Nature abhors dimensional abnormalities, and seals them neatly away so that they don't upset people. Nature, in fact, abhors a lot of things, including vacuums, ships called the "Marie Celeste", and the chuck keys for electric drills.  -- (Terry Pratchett, Pyramids)  In case you are wondering, the Marie Celeste is a 1870 ship which was found drifting about in the sea without a crew. What made this more than a simple abandoning of ship was that there was no sind of any struggle on board. This was no waterlogged, derelict ship. Its sails were set and its timbers were undamaged. As far as the eye can tell, there was nothing wrong with the ship. The cargo, supplies, and personal belongings were still on the Marie Celeste. Evidence aboard showed that the Marie Celeste had clearly been abandoned quickly. The last entry in the ship’s log gave no clue or indication that anything was wrong, neither was there any cause for concern. The only items missing were the chronometer and sextant. Till today, no one knows what really happened on that ship.  Ha, nothing to write liao. Till next time.

      We had chapel today! We had this band jumping around on stage singing songs as usual, nothing special, but what is special is that RCC waved his hands about when told to do so like a little girl! The sight alone caused many of us to break out in peals of laughter.   Nothing much happened today. Mrs Loh didn't come to school, something which I've never remembered her doing. There's a first time for everything, I guess. :P Arrgghh, I've spent all my money on mangas. Don't have any money now. Oh dear. lolz. I just wish that there can be a free web hosting service with an unlimited data transfer rate. But oh well. Beggars can't be choosers.   Anyway, here's another quote:  "Let's just say that if complete and utter chaos was lightning, he'd be the sort to stand on a hilltop in a thunderstorm wearing wet copper armour and shouting 'All gods are bastards'."  -- Rincewind discussing Twoflower (Terry Pratchett, The Colour of Magic)  Till next time.

      My friends and I went to watch Spiderman 2 today!!! Its a great show! Really! No kidding. You just have to watch it. Harry is as usual obsessed with taking revenge on Spider-Man, Mary Jane is engaged to some guy, and Peter Parker's confused over what he should do with his life, thereby causing him to......I mustn't say, it would spoilt the movie. :P I can't wait for the 3rd movie to come out sometime in 2007. Got to watch the Garfield movie too. lolz.  I also had my Chinese O Level Listening Compre today! I'm guessing that i should be able to get at least 16 to 20, if i'm lucky. :D HA, now my chinese O lvl is completely over! YAH!!! BAAWWHAHAHAHHAHAHA! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA! *cough* *cough* Ahem, excuse me. All of you would still have to sit through days of painful waiting and worry about if you would be able to make the grade while I don't have to! BAAHAHAHAHHAA! AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA!  Okay, now that the evil side of me has had its fun, here's the quote of the day:  There are, it has been said, two types of people in the world. There are those who, when presented with a glass that is exactly half full, say: this glass is half full. And then there are those who say: this glass is half empty. The world belongs, however, to those who can look at the glass and say: What's up with this glass? Excuse me? Excuse me? This is my glass? I don't think so. My glass was full! And it was a bigger glass!  -- (Terry Pratchett, The Truth)  Okay, that's it! Be seeing you.

      I had my O lvl Chinese Oral today!!! Did quite badly, i think, didn't know how to read lots of words and i've skipped by as many as three words at a time. lolz. But i think that i should be able to pass, albiet getting marks like 15,16......you get the idea. :D BTW, i'm taking my Chinese O lvl listening compre tomorrow. I hope to get around 16,18, 20. Wish me luck! :P  AHH, don't have much to say, so i'll just give you another quote:  "I know about people who talk about suffering for the common good. It's never bloody them! When you hear a man shouting "Forward, brave comrades!" you'll see he's the one behind the bloody big rock and the one wearing the only really arrow-proof helmet!"  -- Rincewind gives a speech on politics. (Terry Pratchett, Interesting Times)  Again, this is quite true. You see it happening all throughout history, exspically in wars where the USA is involved. The guy at the top is always at the rear where he is safe from everything while the footsoldiers are at the front getting shot, stabbed, cut, crushed, burnt, blown to bits, posioned and what have you. And in wars nowadays, the soldiers have to obey the guys above them even though the overmentioned people are totally useless. And at the end of everything, it is those same morons who gets all the glory and honour and medals and Purple Hearts and what not. All this while the people who risked their lives get hurt - even dead! - and they don't get much of anything unless they get wounded, in which case they just get a worthless Purple Heart! Those guys've lost arms and limbs and watch they friends die just to protect their country and the people living there, and when they come back, they get looked down on and spat at by the very people they've laid down their lives for. And this is because the bloody civilians are trying to get the war to stop but they have no idea what goes on in the fields of fire.  Haiz, those poor soldiers...lets now have a moment of slience for the warriors who have fought and have fallen in battle.....  Well, i've sure typed a whole bunch of stuff without intending to. lolz. Yeah whatever. See you around.

      A lots of things have happened in the last few days, but I haven't got the time to type them out fully. I will try to do that now, but no promises. You see, it is 10:30 now and in a half an hour, I would be lying soundly in my bed, dreaming whatever it is that I would be dreaming. lolz.  First of all, my little sister enter this National Story Telling Competition, and for some strange reason, actually came in first. After think about this unlikely incident, I have come to a few conclusions: 1)Her school bribed the judges. 2)There was a mixup in the prize department and the top prize was given to them by mistake. 3)She really was that good. O.o Go on, take a wild guess as to which is the correct reason. :P In all likelihood, you would be able to read about her in the newspapers in the days to come, so do keep an eye out. :D  Aww, darn! I'm almost out of time! So here is a quick quote, this time taken from Scott Adams, the author of Dilbert.  " I don't know why everyone says poverty can't be eliminated. The solution is obvious to me. All it takes is what bankers call the :"miracle of compound interest." This requires a long-term approach to the problem, but its fairly foolproof if you're patient. All you do is give each poor person a dollar. There are only about 5 billion poor people, so this is quite affordable as a percentage of the worldwide GNP. That dollar is deposited in a special bank account for each of the poor people with the idea that it stays there for generations collection interest. The number of poor people doubles every twenty years, but the value of money doubles every ten years, assuming it is well invested, so the gap will close. In 4000 years, the descendants of the poor people will be allowed to go to the bank and asked for their money. The bank will inform them that the dollar was taken in fees 4000 years ago, and the balance of all their accounts is zero. At this point, the poor people will kill the bankers and steal all the money in the bank, thus ending poverty completely."  -Scott Adams, The Dilbert Future.  Okay, its now 11. I got to go now, but should come back soon in order to tell you all about the days events. Bye for now.

      Hello people! A lots of things has happened in the last few days, and I'm really glad about it! On Friday,  I went to watch "The Spook Show" with Mark. A most unexpected person came along too - Renee! I was really surprised that she was there. Anyway, back to the show. "The Spook Show" isn't bad to watch...The tricks the magician made were quite predictable, but nonetheless entertaining. There is, of course, always a trick involved, but yet we humans still watch a "magic" show to see a trick done well. It is just one of those things that humans do...Even if you have seen lots of magic shows and are able to tell what the next trick's going to be just by looking at the props on stage. :P  After watching the show, I went back home to sleep. Well, duh. Did you expect me to sleep in the streets? Ha.  Well, today we had our mork test on Social Studies and History. I hope that I would do well...I really do...It will show just how good I am....Or how bad I am, depending on how you look at it. lolz. Haiz, my brother is telling to move away, so I will not give you a quote today. Quite a short post, but i suppose that there is a first time for everything. :P

      Its been a while since I've last updated...The reason being that I've just reformatted my computer, and I had to spent time to update Windows and reinstall all my files and what not. Its a tough job, but somebody got to do it. :P I would advise you to reformat your computers at least once every 6 months...It helps clean up your com of any crap that you might have collected over time. But be sure to back up all your important stuff first! You wouldn't want to lose all your work. :P  Hmmm, its been a long day, and lots of things have happened. First and foremost, the release of the 2004 O level Mother Tongue results. *gasp* O.O I'm not sure what you got, but I've got a 6! I passed! Can you believe it? Bawhahahahahahahaa!!! Ahahahahahahahahaa!!! Me, Alvin C., actually passed! I'm on top of the world! *looks down* *gasp* O.O *falls*  Me:"AGGHhhhnonononononononopleasepleasenononourharrrggghhhh.........Splat!"  lolz. Yeah, that's lame. Yes, indeed. *ahem* Okay, lets carry on. It doesn't what grade you got...Try to look at the bright side of it. If you did well, that's fine and good. Try to work harder and score higher next time. And for those who didn't...Weellll, try to harder too. Remember this phrase from dear Mr. Adem, "I am gifted, so are you!" You would be able to do well, I'm sure. Just give it everything you've got, and best of luck.  And now the next important thing of the day...So important that it affects the whole nation of Singapore. It's a day of great joy, one in which our country would receive a new leader...If you haven't guessed by now, it is the signing in of our new Prime Minister, Mr. Lee Hsien Loong...Well, I've just told you, so you have gotten it. If you've watched the live telecast of the whole event, I suppose that you would have noticed that Mr. Lee was extremely nervous when he beening sworn in...So nervous that he placed his hand down before it was done! I imagine that he must be so embarrassed! lolz. But, when he came up to deliver his speech, he did it with such grace and tact that even I would be hard-pressed to outdo him....Why are you looking at me like that? Was it something I said? *ahem* Right. I just hope that Mr. Lee would be able to led Singapore on to a bright new future, one where everyone in Singapore would be happy, at ease will themselves, and most of all, rich. :P Lets hope that Mr. Lee would be able to job as good a job as Mr. Goh...Only time will write the story, and history will tell it.  Okay, this is one very long post...I would love to type more, but i have to study for my SS and History test on Saturday. So here is a quick quote, and I'm signing off:  Natural selection saw to it that professional heroes who at a crucial moment tended to ask themselves questions like "What is my purpose in life?" very quickly lacked both. -- (Terry Pratchett, Interesting Times)  Okay, I'm signing off now. Ciao.

      Ahhh....I've just finished watching Gundam Seed...It's quite a nice show...Gets really touching at the end...So many ppl died...Felt like crying. Those who shouldn't die died, while those who should die also died. As it were. Hard to believe that the almightly Freedom Gundam would be so badly damaged in battle. Really a nice show...The begining is a little boring, but it gets better as it progresses. Long live Gundam Seed!!!  Ahhh, didn't do much today...Spent the whole day watching Gundam Seed. The are a few loopholes though. For example, when the Aegis Gundam attached itself to Strike and blew itself up, how did Kira get to Lucas's house at PLANT? And the ArchAngel...It was able to defend itself so well in the begining of the series...Then, after it was repaired at Orb, its hull could be torn apart by a single missile. lolz. Oh well. :P  Today is National Day!!! Yah!!! I love National Day...Cuz I need not go to school for today and tomorrow. lolz. Try to catch the fireworks, people. If the reports are to be trusted, it will be a sight to behold...Maybe. :P BTW, happy birthday Jun Liang! May all your wishes and dreams come true in the following year. :D  As for Mr. Anonymous...Yes, is possible to load your own songs from your computer to your blog. But first you must find a server which allows you upload your song to your site so that it can be played. I'm using Tripod to upload mine. Then you must decide on which file format your want your song to be...I've converted 1000 Words into a Flash file using LAME software. Then by messing around with HTML, I've placed the file into my blog. Yup, that's about it. Yeah. Hope this helps....The URl from which I uploaded the file is  urlLink http://stifler-leonheart.tripod.com/jade-words.swf .  And here is the quote of the day:  Ridcully was to management what King Herod was to the Bethlehem Playgroup Association. His mental approach to it could be visualised as a sort of business flowchart with, at the top, a circle entitled "Me, who does the telling" and, connected below it by a line, a large circle entitled "Everyone else". -- (Terry Pratchett, The Last Continent)  Yeah, nothing much to type liao. Blessed be.

      Due to popular demand, I've decided to update my blog! Yah! Joy to the world! Yeah, nothing of interest happened during the last few days, so I have not been updating. Alvin Inc. apologies for any inconvenience caused by this lapse in duty. :P  Right! Yesterday, my school celebrated National Day. Mostly what we did was watch the uniformed groups march into the quadrangle, after which we sang the National Anthem. Then the uniformed groups marched off, after which the Girls Brigade performed a complicated drill. They pulled it off quite well, though a few missteps did pop up here and there. I suppose that this is to be expected. After all, they are only human. :P  Now take a wild guess as to what happened next. Yup! Got it in one. We started singing the national day songs. Every year it is the same old story. Every year we do the same thing on National Day. Won’t it ever change? Oh bother…. Anyway, we had our Thanksgiving Festival today. All in all, its not bad…Though it got quite boring in parts.  :D The band played really well, in my option.  Shuyi did a great job singing in the choir. I can’t even begin to imagine the amount of guts it took for her to stand there and sing like it is nobody’s business. Nicely done, Shuyi!  Haiz, next week we would be having another mock test...This time it is Social Studies and History...Again! Apparently, the school feels that we aren't good enough at our combined humanities, so they are trying to give us lots of practice before the Prelims and the Os. Haiz...  Another thing I've noticed...Why do we always say "The school" this and "The school" that when what we really want to say is that the people in charge of the school is the ones who came up with the decision. The school is just a building, a pile of bricks and mortar all placed in a fashion which would allow it to support the weight of all the students. It is not a sentential being. It does not think. So why do we always say that it is the school which came up with the decision? Even I am guilty of doing this. I don't know...I suppose that it is just one of those things.  Okay here is the quote of the day:  In fact, the mere act of opening the box will determine the state of the cat, although in this case there were three determinate states the cat could be in: these being Alive, Dead, and Bloody Furious. -- Schrodinger's Moggy explained (Terry Pratchett, Lords and Ladies)  Ah, too bored liao. Ciao.

      Ah, bloody hell...My com gave up on me while I was typing out my blog...Lost everything I've typed...And it was just a long peice too! Moreover, it didn't happen once, it happened twice! Oh Gawks...  Anyway, the song that i assume you are hearing now is sang by Jade, from Sweetbox, and it's called "1000 Words". Its one of my favorite songs of all time. And like any most of my favorite songs, it is an FF song. Final Fantasy X-2, to be exect. I just love the way it starts off slow at the begining and builds up to its climax at the ending. Isn't it beautiful? No? Oh well, that's too bad. One man's meat is another's posion, as they say.  Haiz, I got back my A Math test paper today...Didn't get as high as I wanted...I'm so bloody lazy that I'd might as well put as apple in my mouth, spread some hay on the floor, and start napping with my arms and legs out to the side. No insult meant to certain members of the animal kingdom and the human race. *ahem* As it were.  Man, I've so got to start working hard...When I compare myself to the pupils from 4/5, I feel somewhat inferior, even though I am a Homo Sapien Superiorlis. :P Their sense of motivation and will to study astounds me. If I could be just as hard working as them, maybe i could....Ahhh nevermind. No way I'm letting the 4/5ians beat me! Going to work hard! Yeah! This is the last lap of the race on this path of daggers, let us all run upon it together...We can make it! And we will make it!  Haiz, I've been asking Victor to pass me a little for, say, about two weeks now. And everyday he will say something like, "Tomorrow, tomorrow! I will bring it!". But when the next day comes, it is nowhere in sight. Makes you even wonder what the little mass of gray matter we have behind our eyes are for...  Okay, here is another quote:  It is a universal fact that any innocent comment made by any recently married young member of any workforce is an instant trigger for coarse merriment among his or her older and more cynical colleagues. This happens even if everyone concerned has nine legs and lives at the bottom of an ocean of ammonia on a huge cold planet. It’s just one of those things.  -Terry Pratchett ( Witches Abroad)  And here is some interesting stuff to know:  Correspondence of Demons to the Seven Deadly Sins (According to Peter Binsfield, a Jesuit, 1589) Lucifer- Pride Mammon- Avarice Asmodeus- Lust Satan- Anger Beelzebub- Gluttony Leviathan- Envy Belphegor- Vanity and Sloth  BTW, did you know that the name Lucifer really mean Bringer of Light? Its kind of strange that such a nice name is changed to mean the same as that of the Devil himself. Well, its a weird world. Truth is usually stranger than fiction.  Ah well, nothing to type anymore. Lets all study hard now. Blessed be.
