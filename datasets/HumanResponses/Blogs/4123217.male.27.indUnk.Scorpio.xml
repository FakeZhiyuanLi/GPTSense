      well it is 12:30 a.m. and i can't sleep. there is this really bright light that sometimes comes on outside of my room and tonight it is the first time it has bothered me. plus, my mind is racing a mile a minute. i tried to listen to my second mind and let it pass but tonight it has my attention a little more. i used to get frustrated with my second mind when it would start singing a song that was really catchy. however, now i just acknowledge it and eventually it passes. i have slept much better since recognizing this practice...  this past weekend was a blast. my taiwanese friend, michael, threw an amazing party. we called it the godfather's party. he is in his forty's and is such a great and interesting guy. he is in semi-retired mode after a successful business career. in the past few years he decided to take english and yoga classes as well as do some traveling. today he seems so relaxed, healthy and full of energy, and is now exploring photography as a hobby... so cool...  posted are some of the photos below   after the party a few of us went to my favourite bar in taiwan called pm. it is owned by a guy named paul who took his art studio and turned it into a bar. he is so friendly and is very welcoming. however, everytime we go there we end up a little tipsy after drinking this monster beer. paul gives us a discount on the beer if we can finish it in a certain time. i am proud (but my body isn't) that we received the discount the other night.  well, i will post some of the photos and try going back to sleep... good night!

        this is the first edition of my blog and thank you for coming to visit. you might have noticed by now that i am only using lowercase letters. i hope this doesn't offend anybody but i just find it so much faster!       well it has been just over six months now that i have been in taiwan and a lot has happened since then. i have moved three times from a seaside community called danshui to a national park in the mountains (yang ming shan) and now in taipei city (technology building area). as much as i loved living in the other two, all the action is in the city.      i live in a three bedroom apartment with sarah downes (tom cahill's friend) from mississauga and a part time roomie named fauna from b.c. we like it because it is on a dead end street so it is nice and quiet. quite a rare find in taipei... peace and quiet...ahhh... but don't let the quiet fool ya, we still have the usual jackhammer sound that seems to be everywhere, everyday in taipei! also, that  DAMN  dog that just won't stop barking!   as you can see i use caps when i am yelling or get angry ;)    bali     two weeks ago i was in bali, indonesia. i took a 4d 4n trip there with my buddy jordan morley (friend from home) and we lived it up in kuta beach at the hard rock hotel. what an awesome trip we had. the weather was incredible and i finally got back on a surfboard after three years. i realized how much i loved it and have committed to go here in taiwan as much as possible.  other than that bali was full of relaxation, shopping, eating good food and partying. i definitely would recommend it to anyone. i would like to go back but next time not in the touristy area of kuta. in fact if i could swing it i am interested in spending 4-6 weeks there around the island... so fresh!     work      last week i started working at a new school near my house. it is a full time kindergarten. yep, i am a kindergarten teacher. i guess all that hard work in university as a biz student is really paying off. dad, you must be so proud of me! funny thing is that it pays more, less hours, and is less stressful than teaching adults. i am still going to continue teaching a few corporate english classes in the evenings, but have really cut back in the adult department.  i have 16 kids aged 5 to 6 in my class. today was the first official back to school day. it was a little chaotic but it worked out just fine. i have a south african co-teacher with me that has 11 years teaching experience under her belt so she is a great help... and a great teacher too! we have different teaching styles but hopefully it will be a nice mix. i like to use a lot of humour with my classes and she is a little more serious.  well it is almost time for me to go to bed so i will leave you with this:  kenny's mtv asia premiere... too funny...   urlLink  click here     it is a video that i got paid to act in for a chinese pop band.  take care and i will see you back here soon!  urlLink          cowboy kenny
