      So life goes on, you fall in love all over again, and live like theres no tomorrow. I guess that makes sense...live each moment as your last. Wow i havent listened to rent in such a long time. But i mean idk...i really miss my life 6 months ago when everything was perfect. Well whatever i gotta stop...like i told ajay, you cant think about the past, because you're never going to get it back, put one foot in front of the other and dont look back. Thats the easiest way to go. So four days till summer, and my cruise. That is something to look forward to. I mean i cant wait till summer, no worries. The cruise i think is going to be good for me too, i mean its basically just a way i can get away for a few days and try to organize my life. I mean its all going to change because of the summer, but mean i can just firgure out how im going to deal with it. Today was actually a really good day. I miss stacey. She needs to come up. I honestly dont think ive seen her since decemeber...wow i really think its been 6 months...yes i do need to see her, she needs to come up so she can meet everyone and i need to go down to meet Kotu...He must be good if shes stayed with him for 3 months wihtout any doubt...wow im really surprised with that. Hm i still havent seen a good picture of him, i need to ask for one. But so Tatiane was ina  wierd mood today, she got into a fight with her parents, and i think she was really bumbed about that. Idk, i feel bad when people are upset. lOl. i feel like its my fault or i did something, idk i just want everyone to be happy. Prom night, i was in such a good mood and everyone wasnt so i made everyone in a good mood, that was fun...lol. SO wow idk i think im out of things to say. Love to all that care enough to read this thing...

      So its been longer than i wanted from my last post. I dont know like a lot has happened. I got into a fight with luis friday night which led to a lot of shit... its okay now, but friday night and all day saturday i felt like a pile of like cow shit. I dont like it made me realize a lot, and i really miss him, and what i had. I dont know like i need to do this, it will take away a lot of stress from my life with my parents, but it also adds because its not what i want...there has to be a loop hole somewhere where everyone is happy. I'll figure it out. So luis is getting a tongue ring...wow im excited. I want one. But that could be cool on him. He needs to do more things that he wants to do...like live life and have fun. Summer is in 4 days, I am crazy excited for it. No more school stress. Moral for the present: Live your life how you want to. no matter what happens, everything happens for a reason, and it will all work out somehow. Don't worry, things will get better, life will go on, and you will get what you want if you try.

      So im sitting here watching Grease. I havent seen this movie in forever. So today i have been really tired> i think its because like all my stress is catching up. I dont know. Like i really miss my life before all this shit, everything seemed so perfect. But you know like i mean you cant go back to the past. I sure wish i could. To about six months ago. That would be wonderful. I dont know that will never happen again EVEr so whatever i have to just live with whats going on right now. There is no future there is no past, i live each moment as my last.  Little rent in all of us.  I mean in all honesty, i think these past 8 months have taught me alot about life. I dont know, like i cant really explain it, but i dunno i just feel like they were a great experience. I miss stacey... a lot. I havent seen her in forever and i just feel wierd. She is like my sister and i havent seen her in god knows how many months. Idk im in like a wierd mood. OI want a new car lol. But hey you cant always get what you want, sometimes i would like to, but i rarely ever do, when its something influential at least. i mean not in the selfish way, but i mean i want my life to be perfect and back to how it was when everyone was happy which made me happy.  Oh well nothings perfect so i gotta deal with life. Love to all those that matter, or rather care.

      So its been two days and i now have a new ritual. So like i dont know my life hasnt really changed that much. I mean i half got into another fight with Luis. Idk its really complicated but i mean i guess we're okay now. So stacey is attempting to get me to make a live journal, but i got confused and like this so i think im gunna stay witht his one. So yesterday i got into a HUGE fight with stephanie. i have never yelled and been right before yesterday. I really dont know like she said that she heard from two sources that said that i said that she doesnt deserve credit for this english project her danny this girl nicole and i did. meanwhile she contradicted herself and i acknowledged it and she realized. SO i mean like i think shes going through a lot and forgot who her real friends are. I guess i can kind of relate. Imean she just broke up with ajay...for reasons unknown, so i mean whatever i think she knows i'm here if she needs to talk to someone. But honestly i think she would rather go out to the farms and drink and forget about her life thent o actually face it. I mean whatever its her life, ic ant tell her what to do or what not to do. SO i think i want to get another job this summer. It could be fun. Handling 3 jobs...well more like 2 and a fill injob for my parents. Either way im going to be making a lot of money this summer and im happy. Lol. so yea  i dont know im starting to feel better about myself. Like my mom came in to talk to me. SHe doesnt think that i talk to anyone about my problems, and in all honesty i dont, like the most i do is talk to danny but he doesnt exactly know what to say so i mean i dont want to bore him or feel like a burden. Oh well i will get over this. Love to all those that care.

      So i just got home from babysitting and ive been talking to like everyone tonight. Tattiane seemed to fill me in on everything that i missed, which is practically nothing except for the usual girl bullshit drama. I kinda like all that though, it gives us something to do. So like 20 minutes after i spoke to tatiane, deena calls and sounds all upset. I immediately know it has some to do with Cory...and surprisingly it is. I also find out that Stephanie broke up with ajay. Is everyone having guy problems? Idk, stephanie i just think is like bored with her life, so she has to find ways to change it, and the only thing she has control of is ajay. But deena said that cory was flirting with Stephanie, which is highly possible considering the circumstances that cory is a manwhore. I also found out that all of luis's friends are gay. Im surprised that he isnt...haha. God i get so grossed out everytime i hear a story about it. I have nothing against gay people, its just their gay tendencies. Like whatever they do is fine, as long as i dont know about it. TYpical stuff that a guy and a girl do is fine and doesn's gross me out except for like orgies and stuff like that, but i mean just thinking about a guy giving another guy head or other homosexual tendencies just freak me out, i dont really know why. But in other news, i was talking to my mom when i got home and telling her that i talked to everyone and luis...she actually was really okay with that. She knows that im not going to give up a friendship. With him, i have made such a good friendship. Like i was talking to staceys mom and she was sayign all this stuff that stacey goes through, and like with casey, she made him one of her best friends,a nd thats how i feel about luis, so i  mean whatever happens, i know that i will have him as a good friend, and i value that. I think im actually starting to get my life back in order. Idk just talking to like tatiane and deena made me feel back into the swing of things. I really dont know its wierd but im actually starting to feel better. Oh so i think i want to get a fish tomrorow. I need to liven up my room. Haha. Its so like depressing. Like plant is dying and im bored of it, i want to go get liek a bush or tree or something different to put into the corner of my room. But so idk im feeling better about myself most definately.I think i can attribute some of it to the journal because i cant just sit there and talk to anyone about this because most of my friends lose interest lol. So this is good for me just to sit and talk, talk talk talk talk talk. But i made 40$ tonight babysitting the cutest little girl. Kaleigh...wierdest name, but cutest girl everrrrrrrrrrrrr. Alright its like almost 1 and i gotta wake up soon. Love to all those that care.

      So where to start? I could go on and on and on about my life. Sometimes i just need to to it to get my emotions out when i cant talk about them with anyone. no one understands what i am going through. Well actually i take that back, i know people have been through what im going through, but i never thought i would have to deal with this. OK from the start. Last Monday...the um 10th or something, i screwed up and got caught lying. Like it wasnt anything HUGE like i still lied and thats the concept, but i was bascially given an ultimatum to break up with my boyfriend by my parents. Like they say they didnt make me, but if i didnt my life would be hell, so i consider that making. But i really dont know. i really do like him, and its so hard for me to do it. I dont even know. Its 1031 and theres no school tomorrow so i mean im going to be home ALONE lost in my thoughts. I think i might also be suffering from minor depression. Like i cant be happy anymore. I know im going through a lot of shit, so i mean i will give it some time, but i feel like the only time i am happy is when im alone. I cant really see myself being happy with my friends. My best friend in town is getting back with the girl he liked...im so happy for him, but thats couple 1, my friend just broke up with her boyfriend last friday, but they got back together last tues couple 2, another friend of mine is hooking up with a guy she likes, thats couple 3, another good friend of mine is happy in love with his girlfriend of a couple months, couple 4, it seems like everyone around me can be happy with their boyfriend/hookup friend, and just being around them makes me so upset. Like i understand that my parents dont like him, but i mean i dont understand what me breaking up with him is going to prove. I know i changed in the beginning when i went out with him, but i mean doesnt every girl with their first real boyfriend? But after many a fight, i straightened up and learned to make sure everyone is happy, family, friends, and boyfriend. And to manage my time. I sure learned how to do that one. But thats all int he past now, eight months down the drain it feels like. I really dont know. God i could go on forever just talking. And i think that this is good for me because i dotn talk to anyone about my problems. I mean i havent even talked to stacey, one because i havent had a chance where i can really talk to her, and i mean two, she doesnt have to go through the shit that ive been going through because shes smarter than me. I feel like such a burden when i complain to people, and maybe thats why people always do their complaigning to me...i dont care, i love helping peopel get through their problems and making them happy. I guess its just one of my incentives to get up in the morning. Lately i havent had one except to be able to see him. I dont know im in such a horrible mood right now and im like tired but i know if i get into bed i will cry myself to sleep like i have been all week and im so sick of crying, but its the only way that i make myself feel better. Ive contemplated running away, but then i would lose everything when i came back. I once had a thought just not to be around, but i am too scared of death, and i know that that wouldntnt solve anything, but sometimes it just seems good. I dont even know anymore. Wow that sounds like one of those manic depressive songs. Ha i could be rich over my pain. Thats sickening how the public society works now a days. This entry has turned into one of those free write things where you just go on and on and on about absolutely nothing. But you know what, this is good for me because i have a hard time talking to people about my life. I can talk to people about themselves or other people, but just not myself. I dont know im like that. so i mean yea like i cant wait until college when im alone making my own decisions and doing things for myself and not for anyone else. I dont know whatever. I really dont have anything to say for once, partially because its just me talking and i have run out of complaigning to do...for now at least. Alright ya'll love to all those that matter.

      Wow well my summer is offically BLAH. god idk what to think, do or say anymore. Like i just feel like my life is falling apart, but at the same time like its going pretty well. Like idk i get into random mood swings around my friends and i feel bad but i mean things that usually dont bother me bother me lately and idk, i just need to get out of this place for a break ya know? I also found out some stuff that i really dont like, but its only hear say so i gotta find out for myself, so i mean technically i cant be mad, but i mean i just feel kind of lied to ya know?  On the other hand, i got a job at a doctors office, i think i already posted that though, but like its official, i had my first real day today. Its cool, i mean its not the most exciting thing in the world, but its gunna keep me occupied ya know? I mean 8 an hour is pretty good i think i can deal with it. But so i guess thats it, i mean like my life is good and bad, but i mean you gotta take the bad with the good, so here goes nothing,take a deep breath, jump into the pool of life, and suck it up.

      So like i dont even know where to start. Its only been almost two months so i guess i have to get back in the habit of writing. I mean like my mind is so mixed up i dont evenknow hwat to think any more. Like im all alone for 4 days, ive been on vacation for three, so i mean i just feel really blahh because all my friends are up in orlando, and i didnt get an invite. Like i understand that im not as friendly with the kid as they all are, but after all your friends are away and you're left alone, you just realize that you might actually be kind of hurt. And i blew up on my mom today because like i thought i was going to be able to go out with danny and jamie but they never called, not surprising, but i mean i was waiting for a phone call so i could be social. I knwo they have to do their own thing, but after they told me that they would clal and didnt, it just kinda hurts. My summer is pretty sucky. Idk im just working alot, and it doesnt compare to summers past ya know. Like im making GREATT money so i guess thats a plus. It just doesnt match up to what i was expecting to last summer. That was a good summer, party all the time, hookup with 3 guys, just be a high school girl. I mean not every summer will be the same and i know that, but i just would have liked to do all that again. So update, this summer i got my first speeding ticket, my first crash that was my fault, and i was able to pay it all with out a problem, and have money to buy a new coach purse and have extra money to blow. I can actually say i have a 9-5 job. I work at a doctors office which is pretty cool cuz it looks good for college, two which im out of here in one year thank god. So Stacey finally drove up here. She came up for too much drama, but i mean it was still fun for the 23 hours that she was actually here. I have completed most of my summer goals. I got fish to live for more than a month, i got a well paying job. I didnt match my guy quota, but i have one that means a lot to me, so 1 great one is better than 3 not so okay ones right? I partied deciently, but not too much, or as much as i would have liked, so i will just have to find a way to make taht up. I still have yet to loose the weight that i would liek to, but now since summer is almost over im joining a gym and getting on a strict diet so maybe i can drop a couple pounds before school. Now that im just rambling on and on im just going to end it, be thankful for hwat you have because once it leaves you realize what you got is worth being had.
