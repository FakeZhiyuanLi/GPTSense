      Wow, it has been a while, but I am back.  So Christmas was very extra excellent to me this year.  I got a plethora of cool/nifty things including but not limited to: A huge-gantic culinary encyclopedia, an alarm clock radio, clothes, and  ALIAS SEASON 2 DVD (most important).  Also, a shoutout to R and Abby.  Hope you enjoyed the cookies.  I am now just going to enjoy the rest of my Christmas vacation.  Signing off.

      When NASA first started sending astronauts into space, it was quickly discovered that ballpoint pens would not work in zero gravity.  NASA scientists spent a decade and  $12 billion  to develop a pen that writes in zero gravity, upside down, underwater, on almost any surface, and at temperatures ranging from below freezing to 300 degrees C.  The Russians...used a pencil.

      Alright...I am sick, and there is like a freakin' blizzard outside.  I hate missing school. I mean it is nice to stay home all day and watch daytime televison programming, but I hate having to make up all the crap that I missed.  Not to mention the fact that Wednesdays are bake sale days and Alyssa won't get her cookie.  Anywho, I am so freakin' bored.  I think I will eat a bagel.  Wish me luck.  I love you, you know who you are.  Over and out.

      I made $41 today, and I bet you would like to know how.  Well then you should ask.  By the way....why is it "$41".  I didn't make "dollars 41".  I made "41 dollars".  So as a revision, I made 41$. Thank you. That is all. It kinda bugged me.  In other news, Britt Z. and I started our official "Chemistry Prayer Journals".  They are a riot!! Oh my.  Gotta run, well walk actually, but you understand.  Good night.

      Wow! What a weekend. I haven't blogged since Friday. Hope you missed me.  So anyway.  Let's see...I actually had an "epiphany" today. I was just like "whoa", but in a speechless sorta way.  I previously stated you can, in fact, judge a book by its cover; well today I learned that sometimes you can't.  Someone said it best: "Expect the unexpected".  ::Sigh:: I still can't believe it!  People, c'mon....I guess it is futile.  I guess I can only save the world one person at a time; I better get started.  Over and out.

      There are so many things in life that I don't understand.  Sometimes, I wish that I would be able to read people minds, to find out what they are actually thinking.  A portable polygraph would work equally as well.  I mean, it is a person's given right to lie, but I really wish everyone was just truthful.  Truth hurts.  Oh well, you'll get over it.  The world (at least my limited one) would be so much more extremely better if everyone would stop acting and start getting real! (Sorry, stole it from the Real World)  I guess I can't change the world or save it from self-destruction.  But I pray to God that I could.  I hope that one day, everyone will wake up and realize that life isn't just about the next dance or whose party everyone is going to.  Yeah, that's important, but...::sigh::...I can't come up with the right words. Nevermind.  Gnite.

      So the Christmas tree is on its way into the house which means the annual family tradition of decorating it will commence in just a short while.  I can smell the aroma of shrimp scampi floating through the house. Oi, I am sooooo hungry.  It is so nice and warm and cozy in the house right now.  But outside...brrrr...that's another story...ya know that mondo-snowstorm I mentioned earlier...well it hit...We got like a couple of inches in just like an hour. It is beautiful outside.  I can't wait 'til Christmas.

      Gah...I am eternally grateful that this week is over.  It dragged on like a hunter bringing a deer carcass to his truck.  Thank God for the weekend.  IKEA and "Elf" tomorrow.  Pretty exciting! I also learned something very valuable this week.  Your opinion on a certain someone, that you thought you knew very well...can change...really quick.  I guess it just makes you re-evaluate your original judgment about that person.  They say not to judge a book by its cover; but through my experience, the cover is an excellent criterion for judgment.  Wow, that was deep.  I have to go do something less intense.  Over and out.  By the way...it is just starting to snow.

      So there is absolutely nothing in this house to snack on! I need food!! Oh well.  I will just eat this Junior Mints. OoOoh minty!  I want to go to Starbucks. Too bad I'm not in Seattle.  I would just walk to the corner.  Oh, by the way, I am taking Christmas orders for chocolate chip cookies, so if ya want some, let me know! Well I'm gonna hit the sack here in a few, after CSI (rerun) is over.   Good night, good night, farewell to thee.  In the morn, in the morn, you I shall see.  Over and out~

      Well today was fine. Pringle gave me a freakin 26 out of 30 on the essay....gah.  Mrs. White was definetly NOT an English major.  Hospo will be missed! Anyway, on a lighter note, there is supposedly gonna be a mondo-snowstorm tonite!***************************************************************** Cross ya fingers!

      I'm kinda in a hurry, but I just had to put this in type.  This morning, between 2nd and 3rd periods and then again between 3rd and 4th periods the theme song to "Law and Order" was playing over the intercom system.  It was soooooo odd!  Also, One Tree Hill was awesome last night...It's a great show. Over and out.

      Yes, well we did get that everso welcomed 2 hour delay! This is my last entry 'til Sunday evening.  I am taking a well-deserved break and going to the....WYS2004!!!  For those of you not in the know, WYS2004 is the Winter Youth Symposium 2004.  A weekend full of snow, tubing, snow tubing, hot tea, and Likey Lunes.  Well I have to go finish packing.  Be back SUNDAY!

      I went to Wal*Mart tonite. Fun as usual.  I bought snacks and chapstick.  Always a good combo.  Well as of right now, there are 38 school closings/delays, and Laurel Highlands isn't one of them.  This is really ticking me off.  They are just gonna announce the delay as soon as I go to bed. GAH!  My school really blows.  Ah well, not much I can do about the whole situation. Gotta run.

      Thursday.  What a day.  I can't believe that CaroleO didn't know what "Wishbone" was.  Wow. This is just plain sad.  1 more day til WYS2004.  The excitement is mounting.  My current book, "Time Stops for No Mouse," by Michael Hoeye is really good.  The plot thickened today when Hermux went in Linka Perfliger's house.  It was ransacked, but I won't say anymore.  This is a great song (see yesterday's entry).  I really need to get packing.  I think we are supposed to have some type of winter weather tonite. I really hope there is a 2 hour delay tomorrow because I don't want to go to swimming.  I just read the weather forecast and it said supposedly 4-6 inches of snow accumulation.  I really love my blog. I highly recommend them to anyone. I could just sit here forever and spill my guts through the keyboard.  Gotta motor.

      Alrighty. Word of the day: IRONY.  Last night, I watched a really good show, One Tree Hill, and I intend to watch it on a normal schedule now. Anywho, the person who sings the theme song, Gavin DeGraw, appeared in a musical performance on last night's episode in the end cafe scene (It was open mic night).  Well, I really liked the song he sang so I downloaded it (I am listening to it right now). I also visited his website. Now for the IRONY.  He is on tour, and tonite, January 21, 2004, the day I practically discover him, Gavin is in PITTSBURGH!  Talk about IRONY.  And to further add to the MADNESS!, my secret crush also like One Tree Hill.  Wow! That is SO Ironic.

      I'm back.  Now where was I...ahh...Tea...Celestial Seasonings.  I just love my Black Cherry Berry.  Anywho, the countdown to the annual game of hostage-taking, match-lighting, phone-calling game of Likey Lunes is on.  I simply can't wait.  I simply love the Plaza.  I simply am simple. Wait a minute.....I have art in my room. Yeah, that's right, ART.  Also, that thing is coming up.  I would try to be more vague, but ya know.

      The AAA Travel Challenge was crazy-hard!  I can't wait for this weekend.  WYS2004! I am buying out all the Celestial Seasonings in the grocery store.  Well I have to go now...Hair cut time...I'll be back soon I hope!

      So I have postponed the AAA Travel Challenge 'til Monday, which means a few extra days to study.  IKEA is just waiting for me (we are going Monday).  Pray that they have my "PICCOLA" light.  The Pringle midterm went just fine, and CarolO was back today, so everything is back to normal.  ALIAS looks so mondo-scary/exciting!! A North Korean firing squad always sends fear right to my bones.  Bobby M. is back from Canada (he was just bee-boppin' around).  I AM SO EXCITED FOR WYS2004!!!!!!  It is gonna be...the best! Forget Laurel Mountain!  Seven Springs here I come!!  Can't forget the tea..and the matches..and "Likey Lunes".  Just can't.

      So the AAA Travel Challenge is stressing me OUT!!!  I am almost finished skimming/scanning "Selling Destinations", the book from which most of the questions are derived from.  So far I have completed N. and S. America, Europe, Africa, and Australia.  I must admit though, the travel industry is rather interesting!  I would really like to learn more about it.  Anyway, 25000$ is certainly worth all this cramming!  Pringle midterm on wednesday. I think it will be a bit easier than what he is making it out to be.  Johann Hyonkerburgherhh test tomorrow! nlx configurations! orbitALs.  VOICE ImoDuLATION!!!  Oh my...gotta love it.  Well, I am gonna go...time to read up on ...JAPAN!!

New episode of ALIAS tomorrow.  Does it get anymore exciting?  I can't wait until Summer!  Or until it starts snowing again...snowing A LOT.  I love snow. I do I do I do!  And my ears keep popping...I mean I am not even in high elevation.  Ulcers. Ear popping.  Maybe I should see a doctor.  Ciao.

I think it will be fun.  I am getting another lip ulcer.  They hurt really bad.  I want to see "Perfect Score" and "Big Fish."  Yes.  Well I am off for now. Ciao!

      Well...I am finally back from my long trip to Sao Paolo...(yeah right)...Hope everyone had a great holiday and new year.  The Quiz Tourney was today.  JV TORE UP!!!  We got 5th out of 10...stupid Greensburg Salem has to go and take it all away from us.  I still got a medal.  A gerund is a verb used as a noun, and Romeo's last name was Montague.  And the hypotenuse was definitely the square root of 864.  Stupid quizmasters.  Oh well.  It is time to go take a nap.  I'll be back later...maybe.

I need a t-shirt now.  Tru Calling and CSI tonite.  Excitement.  I don't mean to cut it short, but I have to go out line for Eric the V (aka Pringle).  See ya on the flipside homefry.

I feel much better now.  Now.  Where was I.  Oh yes,  SO busy.  I am really not looking forward to Thursday.  I am gonna be stuck in Pringle's class for an HOUR AND A HALF, as if 45 minutes isn't long enough.  And tomorrow, I have Messiah Coney for and hour and a half.  Now that I can deal with.

It is in the house someplace, and if I don't find it soon, I don't know what I am gonna do.   I am not gonna be able to sleep.  This blows.

      Oh my.  One Tree Hill is the greatest ever.  I actually cried during last night's ep.  I was so good.  Today, I spontaneously bought a box of Tagalongs today...and they were devoured in 10 minutes flat. THE WHOLE BOX.  BZ and I were eating them left and right. This Sunday, I am having a Mardi Gras get together.  Very exciting.  King Cake and all.  Well I must get going.  The function of Mary Yonker is denoted by "Null Set."

One Tree Hill update:  Is Lucas gonna die?  Will Peyton ever tell Brooke about what really happened?  There is a new ALIAS ep this Sunday.....YAY!!!!!  I so pumped.  I am really looking forward to this weekend.  The only thing that really blows is that we have school on Monday because of all those darn snowdays.  As long as we don't have school on Easter Monday (a.k.a. my birthday), I will be okay.  I think I will go eat a cookie, but not too many.  We are hitting up Frabrizi's tonight for spaghetti.  So good!!

      Yesterday's Laurel Highlands/Albert Gallatin Basketball game was crazy.  If you weren't there, ask about it.  It is way to hard to type down.  Anyway.  Someone said something to me.  And every time I think of what that person said, it makes me smile.  I can't help but smile.  I have to go.  But that really made me feel good inside.

      Hello everyone.  Guess what.  I'M STRESSED OUT!!!  No, I take that back.  Stressed does not even begin to describe my state of being.  I wish I was stressed.  That would so much better than whatever it is I am now.  Firstly, everyone has to write a 250 word paragraph describing our house, in FRENCH.  Secondly, I forgot my swim clothes at school, which translates to me having to bring 2 sets of stuff home tomorrow.  Thirdly, I have to finish typing the February edition of the CBYF Courier so it can be mailed out by the end of the week.  Fourthly, Jeff's Roast/Party, if I were to tell about how it is stressing me out, well it would have sub-categories...So I don't even want to begin with that.  Fifthly, Envirothon is always in the back of my head, saying "Seth, STUDY ME!"  So right know I am eating...Sociables.  Before that I had 2 slices of left-over pizza.  Oh, and another thing.  in swimming today, Jeff knocked my over with the kayak paddle.  I slipped and fell on the hard cement pool deck. Ouch! Tell me about it.  Well I am gonna go try and relax.  If that is possible.  Over and out.  P.S.  One Tree Hill was excellent last night.  Even if Peyton and Lucas didn't, well you know.

So Happy Birthday to both of you.  I have to go work on the "CBYF Courier" now.  I wish I had more to write though.  Oh well.  Over and Out.

      Hey everybody!  Has anyone told you how great you look today?  Let me cut to the chase.  Would any of you, my adoring fans, like to purchase a Spaghetti Dinner ticket?  The dinner takes place on April 3 at 4-7 pm.  You may either eat in or take out.  For a mere $6 (US) you get spaghetti, meatballs, rolls, salad, cake, and a beverage.  If anyone is interested, please let me know, because I have a ticket for YOU! ::points at reader with finger::

      Mr. Mono (Seth) didn't attend school today.  But for some reason he craves fried potatoes with BBQ sauce and some fondue made with Gruyere cheese, of course.  Check mark in the Ridiculously Weird Cravings When You May Possibly Have Mononucleosis Category.  Today the power went off in 7th period--and Yonker lost his voice.  (I know, it was great.)  Miss Iacconi taught all period too.  She is the best.  In Health, Co-Atch says we are speeding through the reproduction chapter like rabbits.  (Yeah, it's nice to make funny jokes.)  Oh yeah, let's hope "Big Mac" doesn't have Mono.  Later.

      Ahh...what a great week!  Oh wait....IT ISN"T OVER YET!!! I wish today was friday.  Scerect Window tomorrow with Kel and Bob and Jer (maybe?). I hope so. I just need to relax. Pi Day Competition tomorrow too.  I glad the Math Club ordered  vomit  colored shirts.  Checkmark in the Tasteless Articles of Mathematical-Related Clothing category.  I am also glad that pool deck was approx.  900 degrees  today. It was like a friggen' Swedish sauna in there.  Not to mention the fact that one could probably poach an egg in the water.  Checkmark in the Ridiculously Warm Recreational Bodies of Water category.  Glad we got that covered.  In other news, my "taking the liberty of being a spy for my friends" has taken a turn for the worse.  I think Meg and Herc are catching on.  "Why?" you ask? Well today I saw them together and  both  of them gave me the.... evil eye .  On the television front, there is gonna be a new  CSI  spinoff.  It will be CSI: New York.  Should be good.  Although no one can beat William Peterson as "Gil Grissom".  Oh, and before I go, Jennifer Garner (of  Alias ) made a recruitment video for the real CIA.  It is the most inspirational thing I have seen.  I loved it.  The part that really lets you know that Jen is patriotic is the fact that she wasn't paid a  cent  to make it.  That is truly awesome!  I love her.  Anyway, gotta start up the oven for dinner. Catch y'all later.

      Hi.  I am co-author Luc.  Let me first start of with a question.  ¿ What  did I say about the talking?  You know there's only one of me and 6.022*10^23 of you (Johann Hyonkerburgherhh).  Today Messiah Coney replaced my batteries--and we talked a  real  conversation.  I told Mrs. Ostrosky about Pi Day this Friday--the same day we were supposed to have the Chapter 11 test--and I asked when if the test was for sure going to be Friday.  She said, "Not anymore... it's Thursday."  Yeah.  Maybe I'll write again sometime soon.  Au revoir.

      Heyah! Water Nymph Project Tomorrrow...that's right, 3 r's, growl!  Alias was uberwunderbar! However, Sloane is most definetly not Syd's father. Also, I wanted to ask all of you a question: What does everyone think about me adding an author to my blog? My good friend Luc is interested in the position.  Anywho, If anyone is interested in attending a spaghetti dinner on April 3, let me know.  And I've got news for J.J., I am NOT swimming on friday. No way in heck am I gonna swim and then go take a test so I can win crappy pie. No WAY!  "If he talks to me again....."  OoOoO...Another good show to watch- "The Best Week Ever".  So funny!  Word of last week: Spongemonkey.  ::moves mouth without talking:: WE LOVE THOSE SUBS! CAUSE THEY ARE REAL-LY GOOD! ::continues speachless mouth movement::  Hey everybody, name your kids Peter Jackson cause then they will win everything he is nominated for!  I have done comedy with Fabio.  The ONLY thing Martha Stewart is guilty of is....making a sinfully delicious chocolate cheesecake.  Speaking of which, there is some in the fridge that is calling my name.  Gotta run!

      Firstly, I would just like to say.....867-5309.  Thank you.  Oh my, One Tree Hill had some crazy revalations.  We know who Jake's baby's mommy is.  And what Deb's big secret was.  And that Hayley has a really great singing voice.  Unfortunately there isn't a new up until April 6th. Talk about crap.  Oh well, maybe there will be repeats.  Well sorry I don't have any good juicy tidbits.

      Well, here is the deal.  I am writing today because I am going to be so incredibly busy next week, that I doubt I will get a free millisecond to even sit down.  Here is my schedule.  I will start with this weekend.  Saturday: Pittsburgh.  Sunday: Church, serving Golden Age Dinner, then shopping for poster supplies (see Tuesday).  Monday: School, Envirothon Meeting with Soil's lady, physical for Drivers' Permit, maybe a violin lesson.  Tuesday:  Election Day, so no school, right?  Wrong, Be @ school @ 9 am to work on poster (see Thursday), order pizza for lunch, leave school around 2 pm, go to Thorpe's Knob in Ohiopyle to study trees,  13 Going on Thirty  in the evening.  Wednesday:  School, then recouping from all the action of the previous few days and preparing for the madness of the next few days, packing for weekend.  Thursday:  Be @ Connellsville McDonald's@ 6:30 am to leave for Slippery Rock University for a Watershed Summit (bring poster), stop at Starbucks/Krispy Kremes first to get sugar,  after summit, go to Grove City Outlets, and then to Sam's Club to get groceries for the weekend, head up to Swiss Mountain at Seven Springs to spend the night.  Friday:  Come down from Seven Springs, school, go back to Seven Springs to spend the weekend studying for Envirothon.  Weekend: Study for Envirothon,sleep, eat, sleep, visit the Springs, sleep, go hiking, sleep.  Well that is the abridged version.  I am tired after just typing it all.  I better go lay down.

      Yes yes...I am still alive.  I haven't published for the longest time.  I apologize.  I had a wonderful birthday and thank you for all the gifts.  I went to the Waterfront today.  Lots of fun.  I didn't spend enough money though.  I got my SAT Scores back today....1300!! I am so happy!  I couldn't believe I did that good on my first time. (For those of you not in the know, 1600 is the best you can do.  Well, I am off.  Pressing matters to attend.

      I am SO mad!  Laurel Highlands is so...full of crap!  So today, I walked in, wearing flip-flops.  Yeah, I know, they aren't technically  legal , but no one every says anything.  I have worn them before.  Anyway, I go into school today, and they are sending people to the office for flip-flop.  "Crap" I thought.  So to make a long story short, I had to call home and get other shoes.  Apparently flip-flops are a dress code violation.  Well if they want to pull "dress code" crap on me, let me pull it out on them.  On Tuesday, I am bringing a camera and taking pictures of other dress code violations.  It isn't really the sandal issue...It is those (excuse my stereotypicalizing) Gothic kids.  They were those  extremely  long chains and straps and stuff.  That isn't just a dress code violation.  They are brazenly violating the school policy. NO Weapons.  I know a lot of kids who feel the same way.  So I am thinking of a petition or something...It just really makes me mad.  I need to go vent or something....

      Sorry everyone....I know I should blog more but my schedule is so packed to the gills...It drives me nuts!  Big weekend coming up...Easter, Birthday, and such.  I mean, you'll have that....anyway.  Be in school on Tuesday, in Mrs. O's room, 8th period. CUPCAKES.  Figure out your soap opera name.  It is your middle name plus your street name.  For example: I am "David Derrick".  Go ahead ....it is fun... You can also figure out your..ehmm.."adult entertainer" name.  Just take the name of the first pet you ever had plus your mom's maiden name.  If anyone has a good one, let me know! I'm out.......

      Oh my...today was freakin' hilarious!  Firstly, there is the question of the day, which I really don't even want to get into.  So ask me about it.  Anyway. At lunch, Talia came over to me and said that she wanted to get Jared back for some April Fool's day joke.  So I was thinking, and I came up with a plan. So we went to visit Mrs. O, the english teacher, who Talia, Jared and I have 8th period. We explained to our plan and luckily, she agreed.  We were going to frame Jared for cheating on a fake pop quiz that Mrs. O was gonna give.  So, let's fast-forward to English class.  Mrs. O announces "Everyone clear there desks, we are having a pop quiz". The looks on our classmates' faces was priceless!  Anyway, about half way through the quiz, Talia, who sits right behind Jared, ( I sit right behind Talia), plants the cheat sheet under his desk.  Mrs. O walks over and picks it up. "Is this yours? I think you were cheating!" she says to Jared. "It's not mine, I swear!" Jared exclaims.  So at this point not only is the whole class taken-aback by the pop quiz, but Jared was sweating bullets!  At the end of the class, Mrs. O called Jared up to her desk.  She was filling out a slip for a week of detention!  Jared was panicking!  Finally, after the afternoon announcements, Talia and I come clean about the prank.  The whole class was relieved that the quiz wouldn't count and Jared was dumbfounded that we pulled off such a great prank. What a great day!

      Welcome everyone to my new and improved blog.  I hope you enjoy the new layout and look forward to more new good things to come.  Anyway.  What is new with me?  Not much really.  School is just about over...I think there are only 11 more days ::angels sing the "Hallelujah Chorus"::  In English, we are ready the worst novel on the face of the planet: "The Red Badge of Courage."  It is truly horrible.  Anyway, I am extremely happy that summer is near, however, I have no vacation plans yet.    I am really hoping that 2 of my Californian friends will come visit. (I am also hoping that they read this).  I am looking forward to holding my ALIAS Season 2 marathon with my good friend Lauren (aka the girl in the picture).  Speaking of ALIAS, the season finale is on the 23rd  , so tune in for some major drama and kick-butt cliffhangers.  Speaking of season finales, One Tree Hill had its finale last Tuesday.  All I can say is I can't even stand the wait unitl this fall.  That will go for ALIAS too, once I see the finale of course.  Well I better get moving.  I have a violin that is lonely.  I'll be back sometime.....

      WHAT A WEEK!!!  It was a freakin' blast!!  I had so much fun this weekend.  On Saturday, I went for a 6 mile hike that took almost 3 hours.  I took some awesome pictures.  I was so beat after that hike.  And this afternoon, I went rock-climbing.....on actual rocks...in the woods!!  I climbed the 20 ft. cliff twice and the 30 ft. cliff once....it was so exhilarating!  I felt so empowered.  I want to do it again.  There is good talk of a Climbing Club next year.....more to come later....ask me about my week....I have to go.

      I went driving today.  On the highway.  Yeah.  It was my first time on the road.  I went from Uniontown to Smithfield then to Hopwood (via Brownfield) and back to Uniontown.  Yep.  It was fun.  Anyway, in something completely unrealated, I am considering applying for the part-time counter person position at Judy Jean's Bakery.  I mean, I understand that isn't exactly the most  thrilling  job out there; but it is something.  Another thing is, if you haven't tried those new Ritz Chips, try them.  They are really good and half the fat of potato chips.  In other news, Gavin DeGraw is performing in Pittsburgh on July 24th.  And, well, I am pretty excited.  The plan is me, Chapman, and Britt Zack, will go down.  But I am not too sure how that will work out.  I really hope it does though.  Well I start summer gym on Wednesday morning, and I need to get back into waking-up-early-mode, so my mother wants me in bed by midnight.  More to come soon.  Signing off...

So if there is something you would like to know about my trip, I encourage you to just ask.  Thank you for listening to the preceding public service announcement.

      Hey everyone!  CALIFORNIA on SATURDAY!!!  If someone were to cut my right now,  I would ooze liquid excitement.  I am terribly anxious to go.  This week is gonna go so slow.  Well I will try to talk about something else.... ..."Summerland", Lori Loughlin's (Aunt Becky from Full House) new show, is so good.  I am watching the Pilot again.  I highly recommend it.  It will air on the WB on Tuesday at 9.  OH OH OH... Let me tell you about Friday.  Last Friday,  I went down to the Waterfront with Jeff, Luc, and Company.  We saw Harry Potter 3 at Loews Theatre.  The movie was awesome!  However, I thought the ending kinda sucked with the freezeframe of Harry riding off into the sunset (how cliche!).  Anyway, and the Theatre itself was so nice!!!  Then I ran into a predicament at the Snack Stand.  I had a soft pretzel (approx. $25).  Then I was thirsty.  So I bought a large Icee (approx. $52).  Then all of sudden, it happened.  I turned around, and there it was.  The ice cream stand.  And what caught my eye?  The made to order milkshakes.  So you know, I hop in the line and purchase myseld a chocolate milkshake (approx. $97.29).  So I am like "Icee....or Milkshake.  Milkshake....or Icee".  I ended up drinking both! HA!  The point of the story is that I we ate at BRAVO! Cuccina Italiana for dinner.  It was so delicious.  I had the Shrimp Diavolo.  It was penne pasta in a spicy tomato cream sauce with shrimp.  It was simply divine.  The tiramissu I had for dessery was  eccelente , right down to the chocolate-covered espresso bean that garnished the top.  Friday was a great day.  Well I think I have enough typed for today.  Buona Notte!!

We had seats in the second row!  The actors were great and the singing and the sets and the costumes...all wonderful.  Anyway, I better go.  Sorry to cut things short, but I have somethings to do and I want to get to sleep earlier tonight.  I'll be at the fair tomorrow from like 11:30 am to 4 pm.  Stop out and visit!  I'll be there Monday night too, from 6 pm and 11 pm?  I think so.  Summer's Best 2 Weeks starts Monday morning.  I am gonna be so drained for the next 2 weeks.  Well,   I am off.   Have a good night and a pleasant tomorrow.

      So I am just sitting here, and I am like, "Hey, I think I am gonna blog for a bit."&nbsp; So here goes...   ...I think I want to do a short-term student exchange.&nbsp; I have to contact my local Rotary club to see if they sponsor scholarships and what not.&nbsp; I definetly wouldn't be able to do this without a scholarship.&nbsp; I would love to go to France for a month or 2.&nbsp; Or Italy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Well, tomorrow, I will hopefully have some photos from the FayCo Fair.&nbsp; Kel and I working tomorrow morning.&nbsp; I will also be working on Saturday morning, Sunday afternoon, and Monday night.&nbsp; I'm sure I'll be working some more nights next week;&nbsp; I'll post the schedule later.&nbsp;   Let's see, this friday...Fair, SB2W staff training, then the CBYF is going to see  Joseph and the  Ama  zing   Tech  nicol  or   Dream  coat   at the West Virginia Public Theatre.&nbsp;&nbsp;We always have fun on our group outings, so this should be no exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that when we go to McDonald's (like&nbsp;last year) that the roof starts to drip water, and then break out into a rushing waterfall coming from the ceiling.&nbsp; I guess that is West Virginia for ya!&nbsp;   I almost forgot.&nbsp; I applied for the part-time position at Scott Lynn Square 1-Hour Photo.&nbsp; Let's hope this works out.  That is all I have for&nbsp;now.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Yeah, camping was fine.  Anyway.  Summer is going way to fast.  It really needs to slow down.  Unfortunately,  I am really bored.  I don't know what to do just sitting here all day.   We had yet another  Summerfest  last night at my house.  Everyone was in attendence.  Then, at 9:45, we moved the party down to Jer's house.  Basically,  I only have a few more weeks of boredom cause then the excitement starts.  Youth stuff, SB2W, VBS, school shopping, then finally, Junior year starts.  Wow.

      So.  Yes.   Summerfest  at Matt's house tonite.  It should prove to be...interesting.  Pizza, a movie, you know...the usual.  I suppose.   I got a postcard from Martina yesterday.  I am jealous that she is in the Virgin Islands.  I have been practicing Briscola so I can beat her when she gets back.    Upcoming movies I am looking forward to:  Anchorman, Ocean's 12, A Series of Unfortunate Events, The Bourne Supremacy.   You know. I haven't told anyone this story yet, but I feel the need to tell it now.  When I was in Los Angeles, Rafaela and Maira took me to Olvera Street in downtown LA.  Now, Olvera Street is the little cobblestone street that is mainly Mexican influenced.  Anyway, while we were there, we went to the house that is the supposed to be the oldest house in LA.  As we walked around the casa, we noticed little signs that explained the room that you were currently in.  In the "Family Room," there was one of those signs.  Now here is the irony.  The words "The Family Room" on the sign was in the same font as the words "Family Matters" on the opening credits of the show "Family Matters."  Maira pointed it out and I was like, "Wow, it really is the same font."

       Summerfest:  Independence Day  was a blast!  Me, Kel, Bob, Jer, and Matt @ Bob's.  We played 4, that's right, 4, games of "Scene It", 3 of which me and Kel won.  Then we had hamburgers and hot dogs and brownies (yum!).  By then, the rain had stopped, so we headed down to Hutchinson to see the fireworks.  We sat right across the lake from where they were set off, so we could see the explosions perfectly.  Then we went back to Bob's and had a night swim.  We ended up telling scary stories all huddled together in the pool.  Now I am home and comfy in my sweatpants.  What a day.  Tomorrow will bring mulch.   Yuck!  I really hope it downpours tomorrow morning.  In the afternoon, Grandma Connie is having a picnic for family and friends and whatnot.  Then back to Summer Gym on Tuesday.  Eat 'n Park sure would be good tomorrow morning....

      So I just got back from Kel's  Summerfest .  We had a fun time tonite.  Me, Kel, Jer, Bob, and Matt.  We swam and watched Reno 911 and then played Hide and Seek in the Dark.  It is so much fun.  And Janet's wedding went well.  Lots of things to "drink."  Yeah, I was happy.  Well, there isn't much new in my world.  Summer gym is so much fun.  Lifting, walking, swimming, and playing organized gym activites.   Can't beat that.  No, really, you can't.  I laugh so much, it is unbearable.  I am gonna go now.

      So wow.  There has been onoly 2 days of SB2W so far and I am already drained.  The heat, the kids, just everything is so tiring.  But I am having a pretty good time, all things considered.  I hate to make this post so short, but I have to cut the frickin' grass on top of all of this.  I'll be at the fair tomorrow night from 6-11.  Kel too.  Stop out.   By the way, I would just like to congratulate Kel on the bottle punt in the Dumpster Olympics.  Also, a congratulations goes to Jessica Tandy for just being so darn precious!
