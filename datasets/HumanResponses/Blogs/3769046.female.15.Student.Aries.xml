        movie:  I shall not bore you people to death w/ the morning crap. On to the movies. Saw people. Took long on choosing what movie to watch. Altho the original plan was to watch 'a cinderella story.' But resulted into four people watching 'the notebook.' And the rest (12) watched 'a cinderella story.' First went to the washroom. Thus making us a little late to the movie. Was dark. Freakin' person scared me. But at least he hurt himself in the process, hah. So went in. Somehow ended up in a retarded position. But then someone took someone's spot. So I guess it was pretty okay. So previews for some movies. Tennis. We started talking about tennis, and how we suck so badly. Hahaha. Then yu-gi-oh. Woohoo, we're gonna watch yu-gi-oh in august! What fun. Then more previews and talking about weird things. I think we talk too much w/ each other. Seriously, I think we do. Bleh.&nbsp;So movie started. Saw castle, started talking about housing, hah. Then more talking. Movie was pretty okay. Felt a little claustrophobic at times. He kept nudging. But it was okay. Just laughed a lot. I was pretty content where I sat. Two fun people to be w/.&nbsp;Lmao, laughed at such retarded parts. Called so many people ugly in the movie, that was crazy and fun.&nbsp;    after movie:  &nbsp;Went to the arcade place. Got in trouble, wasn't our fault. Hah.&nbsp;So yeah. Waited for the people watching 'the notebook.' Took hella long. But finally&nbsp;we were all re-united..*rolls eyes* So divided ourselves into four teams. Bowling was okay. Dunno if I ever would go bowling&nbsp;again. Hah. So time passed quickly. Was a&nbsp;little too close to me. My god, this summer. A little too freakin' close to me!   after bowling: &nbsp;Then went&nbsp;back to silvercity. Saw my aunt. Some two people were discussing about their movies. My god, I bet she hates me for interrupting them. I don't know if she's still denying that she likes him, 'cuz it's so obvious. My goodness. So many people these days are in denial. Quite sad actually. So some people stayed and watched 'dodgeball.' And others went to richmond center. But first we went to subway. Then got on the bus. Took a long time to get to richmond center. Haha, so much debates. That was funny. Then went to td canada trust. Then finally to richmond center. Bought and ate food. Walked around a little. Met up w/ the other people again. Then went home. Overall, today was pretty fun.

       Yesterday. Found out hi5ness. Only now. And today, didn't bother talking to me. Will I bother talking? That I do not know. Bleh, not gonna be like that. I will not degrade myself to that level. Hahaha. Heh, but only now. That freak. Not gonna bother using hi5. Just this and yeah. Think he can just do that. But how do i know that was his intention? I can't assume, I'll be so confused. Even tho we learned in math, to make assumptions. But I believe this is not a time to make assumptions. Only time will tell. But I do believe we need better communication, in order to understand each other. And now, the only thing I intend to do this summer is to have a great time w/ friends.. *Sigh* What is a friend? "One whom one likes, trusts, knows?" I don't really know if that's a proper definition for my situation right now. What can I do? Why does he keep on freakin' asking?!? I should why did, hah. WEIRDNESS.

       "I can't seem to find the right words to say,  to tell you that I feel this way.  I want you what can I do,  to make you want me next to you.  If you look at me you'll understand,  all I want is to hold your hand.  I felt this way for oh-so-long,  and it hurts me that I don't belong.  Wanting you to want me it's all a dream,  my heart aches I just want to scream.  I smile and laugh just thinking of you,  together here I wish it was true.   I always imagine of your gentle touch,  if only you knew that I felt this much.  Not being with you I'm falling apart,  'cause I don't know how to get your heart.  If you could only see the love in my eyes,  of all those nights when I sat and cried.  Just look at me I'm standing here,  just call out my name and I'll be there.  How the long the wait I do not know,  but when the day comes I'll let it show.  If only you knew me feelings for you,  I'll stay hopeful you'll feel the same way too."

       "Friends are always there for you,  especially when you're blue.  They're always there to hug and kiss,  especially when you're pissed.  True friends never lie,  true friends speak their mind.  With all your problems from girls to guys,  with their trust, you never be shy.  So when you're sad or pissed,  you'll be glad to have friends like this."   - annoymous.   Heh, makes me feel so happy..=).

       Start of grade nine, was pretty okay. Found out I was gonna be in a homeroom w/ a another new teacher. Found out new teacher was ms. p. I guess she was an okay teacher. First late start. Was a memorable one. I remember I was trying to do my english hwk, but I couldn't. 'Cuz like how many guys were sitting around me, trying to look at my things. And that stupid child, he always moved my bag so that he could sit beside me. My, that was awkward. Bleh. Didn't pay attention. Just went on w/ my english hwk. I remember, that was a stupid assignment. Didn't really get to finish it, tho. Stupid people. They were so disruptive. Couldn't get any work done. My, my, those were the days. Talked a lot back then, but now, we don't really. Bleh. Elemantaryness, whatever. Hmmm, grade nine passed by fast. I guess I did have a lot of fun. A hell of a lot. September  -  crazy month. Some birthdays, yuck, heh. October  -  halloween, didn't dress-up. Altho ricardo told me he'd give me $5 if I'd be a oompa loompa in grade ten, hmm, still have to think about it. November  -  poppy song! Loved that song, heh. Interms. Shoot. Bleh, did pretty well. Got ones and twos, not threes! December  -  wasn't in canada for most of the time. Bleh. Shots. Then philippinesness. Woohoo. That was relaxing. Loved it. My, I'd go back, but I love canada too much, heh. January  -  still in philippines. Came back. Mid-terms. Sucked. Bleh. Have to study a hell of a lot in grade ten. Musn't slack off anymore. February  -  passed quickly. I wonder why..*rolls eyes* Valentine's day, was that even celebrated? Hah, don't remember. March  -  passed quickly. Spring break and celtic spirit week. Laughed quite a lot during the month of march. April  -  my bday month! Birthday was on a school day. He sang. Other people sang. Craziness. My bday party. Bowling. Fun. Gonna have another one, heh. May  -  passed quickly. Lots of field trips. June  -  passed so freak ass quickly. Card playing in phys. ed and math classes. Eww, touchingness, hah. Awards assembly. Huggingness. Beachness! Hella fun!

       What is a friend? To me, it's someone you can talk to, laugh w/, feel comfortable w/. Altho I do know other people have their own definitions. What's his? Bleh, I'll know some day.. The definition from dictionary.com is:   "1. A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts.  2. A person whom one knows; an acquaintance.  3. A person with whom one is allied in a struggle or cause; a comrade.  4. One who supports, sympathizes with, or patronizes a group, cause, or movement: friends of the clean air movement."   Hmm, whom one knows, likes, and trusts? So are we friends? I've noticed in grade nine, I've made more friendships than I ever did in elementary. My, those were the days. But now, I've been busy planning so much things! I'm like the summer activity planner! Hah.

       Was fun. Freakin' children. Why must they always smile? I can never understand guys. And I do not think that I ever will. Seriously. Bleh. Are or are we not? Does he want more? That, I will never know. Bleh. Don't want to think about that. Told my parents that I would concentrate on school before thinking about that. So I have to stay true to my word to my parents. And I do think that I may stay at st pats 'til I graduate..=). Yes, I love this. Thank-you god. I promise to do those things in that very heart-felt paragraph. I do promise to do well. And I promise to try my hardest. And now, I must enjoy summer time..=).

       Pretty good movie. I enjoyed watching it. Little kid that was beside was hilarious. Saw enfers, "pssst"ed us. Blah. Sara went into stalking mode. But met up w/ three of them at the stairs then at the escalator. And someone else went into stalking mode, too. Seriously. She's obsessed. Like crazy stalkerish.   Wtf?!?!?! I don't understand this.. Are we friends or are we not? We act like friends.. Then again, I don't know. What does he want us to be? Seriously, I'm so confused.. Why must guys always tease me? I can never figure out things when they're chasing me or vice-versa. I'll watch very closely during the next beachness. Hopefully I'll be able to figure out something.

       It was on the twenty-ninth. Hella fun. Attendees: moi. xtine. cass. mae. jamie. sara. monica. val. gezelle. clr. emily. lance. arcie. brian. jason. ig. eric. moby. stephen. lloyd. richard. gezelle's parents. Beginning was like sitting around talking. Walking on the beach. Was freakin' rocky. Woman was recording us. Freakiness. Then the "enf-ers" came. Pronounced: enphers. Huge ass water fight started. It was them against girls. Holy crap. That freak ass huge water balloon, lance got me first w/ that thing! Stupidness. Then more water fightness. Then it slowly trickled down to cass and I against enf. Holy crap. So out-numbered! 2:8?!?!? Wtf?!? And our weapons were like these tiny ass pails! And enf had water guns and water balloons. And after awhile, when enf were "refilling," cass and I stalked them, but they took so damn long. Then the second time we followed them, gezelle and sara came along. But then they left us, those ditchers! Hah, take that moby! Dogwater! Go cass! Haha. Oh my, what fun times. Sand castleness. Mine was so much better than gezelle's *rolls eyes* Burying-ness. "Awww"-ness. I bet she did like sitting there, can't deny it. My god. It's so obvious, seriously. Ice cream truckness. Climbing the jungle gym. Walkie talkieness. Sleepiness. He was a little too close to me. But whatever. Kits beachness was pretty fun and crazy, I enjoyed it..=). Next one = soon..woohoo!
