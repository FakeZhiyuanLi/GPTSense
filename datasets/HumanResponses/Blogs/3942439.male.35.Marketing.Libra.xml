       A few months ago I was introduced to  urlLink LinkedIn . Since then I've grown my network of trusted business contacts to over 120.   With linkedin, you can wash your own Outlook contacts with those using Linkedin. When I joined I did this and found over 35 people I already knew were using the tool - the sort of people that are active networkers and I expected would be using it.   It works on the basis of trusted relationships or 'degrees of separation'. Those joining my network are able to search my contacts, and if they wish to make contact - ask permission from me and vice versa.   Why not give it a try! Create an account at www.linkedin.com  urlLink  then invite me to join my sending an email from my  urlLink contacts  page.

       I've been using WiFi for nearly 4 years - when my Dlink access point cost me $1100!  &nbsp;  Now you can pick up a WiFi bundle for under $300.&nbsp; Even printers now like the HP 2510 "multi-function" unit come with WiFi built in, meaning your home network can share the same resources.  &nbsp;  The Netgear DG834G is the new breed of unit which combines an ADSL modem, router and access point - meaning your home office can be totally wireless!      &nbsp;

        Comments from a US based Technologist &nbsp;   The big question in the US is who is going to win the next telecom war:&nbsp; wireless, wireline or cable.&nbsp; They each have a critical strength and weakness, and each can potentially give away the other's service for free.&nbsp; The phone companies have DSL but are challenged to fund it.&nbsp; The long distance carriers are toast.&nbsp; Wireless providers are in a better position but perhaps too tied to their equipment vendor solutions.&nbsp; The cable companies have surprised everyone, they are scrappy, and are able to service homes at the lowest cost, but don't have the integration skills the others have.&nbsp; Who wins?   Wireless Broadband Convergence is the key (not simply wireless broadband but how it will all come together).&nbsp; How will the different network fabrics converge?&nbsp; What services will drive demand?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Over half of voice traffic is 800 traffic.&nbsp; Using this analogy, what is the potential for 800-type broadband services (recipient pays)? &nbsp; There is also a lot of talk about dual home/roam phones.&nbsp; I think this gets more attention than it deserves, but it would save customers money. &nbsp;   What new services will emerge?&nbsp; What about video over IP? &nbsp; Telecom is has been in a terrible slump but I think that's about to change dramatically.&nbsp; I expect we will see the first signs from outside the US.&nbsp;

       Webcentral (where  urlLink www.andrewgrill.com  is hosted) provide an amazing managed exchange email package, allowing you to have the power of an exchange email platform without any hardware costs.&nbsp; Emails are displayed via a web page using Outlook web access - which looks identical to Outlook 2003.&nbsp; Their web hosting packages also includes access to the Deep Metrix Livestats.XSP site statistics package.

       I've been using the  urlLink iBurst  (1MB/s) system for a few months now and have found it to be fantastic for LegionONE demonstrations to clients etc.&nbsp; 3 now have a Net Connect card with a $100/month 1GB plan which is also very competitive. &nbsp; So what's next - will Telstra improve their CDMA service (145kb/s) to reach the speeds of 3 or iBurst? &nbsp; What are business users willing to pay for wireless broadband?&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;
