WISH YOU WERE HERE.....................................5.35 5.SHINE ON YOU CRAZY DIAMOND (PART VI-IX)....12:31   Wish You Were Here lyrics    "Shine On You Crazy Diamond (I-V)"   Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun. Shine on you crazy diamond. Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky. Shine on you crazy diamond. You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom,  blown on the steel breeze. Come on you target for faraway laughter,  come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine! You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon. Shine on you crazy diamond. Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light. Shine on you crazy diamond. Well you wore out your welcome with random precision, rode on the steel breeze. Come on you raver, you seer of visions,  come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!   "Welcome To The Machine"   Welcome my son, welcome to the machine. Where have you been? It's alright we know where you've been. You've been in the pipeline, filling in time,  provided with toys and Scouting for Boys. You bought a guitar to punish your ma, And you didn't like school, and you know you're nobody's fool, So welcome to the machine. Welcome my son, welcome to the machine. What did you dream? It's alright we told you what to dream. You dreamed of a big star, he played a mean guitar, He always ate in the Steak Bar. He loved to drive in his Jaguar. So welcome to the machine.    "Have A Cigar"   Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar.  You're gonna go far, fly high, You're never gonna die, you're gonna make it if you try;they're gonna love you. Well I've always had a deep respect, and I mean that most sincerely. The band is just fantastic, that is really what I think.  Oh by the way, which one's Pink? And did we tell you the name of the game, boy we call it Riding the Gravy Train. We're just knocked out. We heard about the sell out. You gotta get an album out, You owe it to the people. We're so happy we can hardly count. Everybody else is just green, have you seen the chart? It's a helluva start, it could be made into a monster  if we all pull together as a team. And did we tell you the name of the game, boy we call it Riding the Gravy Train.   "Wish You Were Here"   So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain. Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell? And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?  Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change? And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage? How I wish, how I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year, Running over the same old ground.  What have we found? The same old fears. Wish you were here.   "Shine On You Crazy Diamond (VI-IX)"   Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far. Shine on you crazy diamond. Pile on many more layers and I'll be joining you there. Shine on you crazy diamond. And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph,  sail on the steel breeze. Come on you boy child, you winner and loser,  come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine   Many people will always say that after a band's greatest album, that the band will never meet their standards from their greatest albums. Many have quit or just gone down hill, but not  Pink Floyd . No, they came back & bit the music business in the ass!   Now the music business music is small, narrow, & arrogant. They don't know anything, but what they want to know & what they want to think.  Wish You Were Here's  two great songs  Welcome To The Machine  &  Have A Cigar  are both about how impersonal the music business is. They are so impersonal that they tell you what to wear, hear, know, want, & need. Those fucked up old hags were always wrong & they just needed somebody to tell about that & shove it their ass.   Syd Barret  is a very big deal about  Pink Floyd . The band's co-creater & first lead guitarist & lead vocals. The album's songs  Shine On You Carzy Diamond Parts 1-5, Wish You Were Here, & Shine On You Carzy Diamond Parts 6-9  are about the memory of  Syd Barret  & how he was forced to leave because of tripping-outs from drug abuse & the future for the band. He was forced to leave, because he wanted to put in saxephones & female back-up singers. -Richard Dasher

       urlLink RHAPSODY Link                                              Dark Side Of The Moon Pink Floyd Harvest 11163 Released: March 1973 Chart Peak: #1 Weeks Charted: 566+ Certified Gold: 4/17/73      One of Britain's most successful and long lived avante-garde rock bands, Pink Floyd emerged relatively unsullied from the mire of mid-Sixties British psychedelic music as early experimenters with outer space concepts. Although that phase of the band's development was of short duration, Pink Floyd have from that time been the pop scene's preeminent techno-rockers: four musicians with a command of electronic instruments who wield an arsenal of sound effects with authority and finesse. While Pink Floyd's albums were hardly hot tickets in the shops, they began to attract an enormous following through their US tours. They have more recently developed a musical style capable of sustaining their dazzling and potentially overwhelming sonic wizzardry. The Dark Side of the Moon is Pink Floyd's ninth album and is a single extended piece rather than a collection of songs. It seems to deal primarily with the fleetingness and depravity of human life, hardly the commonplace subject matter of rock. "Time" ("The time is gone the song is over"), "Money" ("Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie"), and "Us And Them" ("Forward he cried from the rear") might be viewed as keys to understanding the meaning (if indeed there is any definite meaning) of The Dark Side of the Moon. Even though this is a concept album, a number of the cuts can stand on their own. "Time" is a fine country-tinged rocker with a powerful guitar solo by David Gilmour and "Money" is broadly and satirically played with appropriately raunchy sax playing by Dick Parry, who also contributes a wonderfully-sated, breathy solo to "Us And Them." The non-vocal "On The Run" is a standout with footsteps racing from side to side successfully eluding any number of odd malevolent rumbles and explosions only to be killed off by the clock's ticking that leads into "Time." Throughout the album the band lays down a solid framework which they embellish with synthesizers, sound effects and spoken voice tapes. The sound is lush and multi-layered while remaining clear and well-structured. There are a few weak spots. David Gilmour's vocals are sometimes weak and lackluster and "The Great Gig in the Sky" (which closes the first side) probably could have been shortened or dispensed with, but these are really minor quibbles. The Dark Side of the Moon is a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement. There is a certain grandeur here that exceeds mere musical melodramatics and is rarely attempted in rock. The Dark Side of the Moon has flash -- the true flash that comes from the excellence of a superb performance. - Loyd Grossman, Rolling Stone, 5-24-73.     Bonus Reviews! This LP is a tour de force for lyricist Roger Waters. The band is ingrained in a program of heavy, introspective statements, balanced well by their broadly intensive playing. This is music for intense listening. There are fine effects that make the guitar bristle. Best cuts: "Time," "Money," "Brain Damage," and the title tune. - Billboard, 1973. Dark Side Of The Moon is the album which dominated the '70s. Released on March 24, 1973, it ushered in an era of album-oriented rock and transformed Pink Floyd from ranking English acid-rock conceptualists to a goliath of the international super-league. It enjoyed unprecedented chart longevity, especially in America, where it was the group's first album to breach the Top 40. It remains a perennial presence, especially in the CD market, and in the four years since David Gilmour and and Nick Mason revived Pink Floyd and set off on the Momentary Lapse Of Reason tour, Dark Side Of The Moon has sold four million copies, bringing the current sales tally to 23 million. The album was made during the summer of 1972, at a time of rapid technological change. It was recorded on 16-track equipment at Abbey Road, with the new Dolby noise reduction system being adopted halfway through the sessions. A decision was taken not to do a quadrophonic mix, although that ill-fated system was just beginning to appear on the domestic market. EMI went ahead anyway and commisioned a quad mix from then-engineer Alan Parsons, which the record company played at a press conference held at the Planetarium to launch the album. The group did not approve and boycotted the event, their place being taken by life-size cardboard cut-outs. As was the practice in those days, the Floyd maintained a steady gigging schedule throughout the period of the recordings, but Dark Side Of The Moon was the first album which the band had both written and toured before going into the studio. "It was called 'Eclipse' when we first played it live," recalls David Gilmour. "We showcased it to begin with at five nights at the Rainbow, which tightened it up performance-wise, although one or two of the pieces which were a bit more performance-oriented got thrown out and replaced in the studio. 'On The Run' started as some strange onstage jam, but when we discovered the sequencer capability of the little VCS3 synthesizer we used that instead." The album bears the legend "Produced By Pink Floyd." "In theory we were all producing," says Gilmour, "but in practice it meant that Roger (Waters) and I would argue considerably about how it should sound." Chris Thomas (who later produced The Pretenders, The Sex Pistols and others) was called in at the mixing stage as a "neutral party" to try and resolve the the internecine wrangling. Clearly, Dark Side Of The Moon has touched a deep chord with succeeding generations of record and CD buyers, a reflection perhaps of the timeless qualities of both its production and its theme. The production, although basic by today's standards, does not sound unduly primitive. Indeed, there are later Floyd albums which now sound more dated. This was probably due more to luck than judgement. Although the Floyd have always been renowned for their stringent quality control, their music, like any other act's, was frequently locked into the spirit of its time. But not only are tracks like "Money," "Time," "Us And Them" and "Brain Damage" powerful, concise musical statements, they also boast a cohesive thematic content. While Gilmour provided many suitably majestic instrumental passages, Roger Waters's lyrics bore down with stark perception on a universal subject -- the simple, often trivial pressures of daily life that can lead to insanity. Still a couple of years shy of his 30th birthday, Waters had already twigged the ultimate misery of it all, and he wrought his bleak verse with bold slashes of the pen. There was no air of a false new dawn or hippy optimism about this record; rather the beginning of the end. Despairing observation that with each new day... "you're older/ Shorter of breath and one day closer to death." Dark Side Of The Moon has been available in CD format bearing EMI's 001 catalogue number since August, 1984, and it remains among the top 10 selling CDs of all time. With its striking sound effects of chiming clocks and ringing cash tills, it is the sort of album that has traditionally appealed to the audiophile section of the rock market and has doubtless been a priority purchase for many proud investors in the new CD technology. Such fans may be surprised, if not dismayed, to learn that the early CD version of the album was transferred not from the master tape, but from a standard 15 ips Dolby copy, a practice which David Gilmour believes to be fairly widespread. "We weren't involved initially. They just went ahead and did it. When we found out about it we had to do an investigation to find out where the real original master was, and then have it remastered." Dark Side Of The Moon was undoubtedly a high water mark in the Pink Floyd odyssey. Gilmour now recalls that "it changed our fortunes everywhere. We became much more visible. We were selling out 12-15,000-seater venues in America, but thereafter we could sell out vast football stadiums and we had to change our ways of doing shows. Whereas we used to get a respectful silence from the audience, once 'Money' had been a hit single (it reached Number 13 in America) we had thousands of kids partying at the front. Some of the things we had been able to do previously, such as very quiet sequences, simply didn't work any more." Waters took a jaundiced view of its impact. Speaking in 1987, he declared that Dark Side Of The Moon "finished the group off. Once you've cracked it, it's all over." Either way, the album remains a work of rare intensity, a powerful evocation of the shadowy corners of the rock psyche. Plainly unsuitable as an accompaniment for the snappy advertising of beer or jeans, it seems entirely appropriate that the one track from Dark Side Of The Moon which has found its way into a TV commercial -- keyboard player Richard Wright's haunting interlude for piano and voice, "The Great Gig In The Sky" -- was adopted for a surreal Nurofen painkiller advertisement. Large chunks of the album still feature prominently in the live shows of both Pink Floyd and Roger Waters and it is clearly a body of work that has become part of the collective rock consciousness. The secret of its longevity is anybody's guess, although one clue may be the curiously reductive quality which it has demonstrated over the years. As Gilmour notes wryly, "I thought it was a very complicated album when we first made it, but when you listen to it now it's really very simple." - David Sinclair, Q magazine 5 star review. With its technological mastery and its conventional wisdom once-removed, this is a kitsch masterpiece -- taken too seriously by definition, but not without charm. It may sell on sheer aural sensationalism, but the studio effects do transmute David Gilmour's guitar solos into something more than they were when he played them. Its taped speech fragments may be old hat, but for once they cohere musically. And if its pessimism is received, that doesn't make the ideas untrue -- there are even times, especially when Dick Parry's saxophone undercuts the electronic pomp, when this record brings its cliches to life, which is what pop is supposed to do, even the kind with delusions of grandeur. B - Robert Christgau, Christgau's Record Guide, 1981. And the hit just keeps on coming. 292 weeks in the British chart were impressive enough, but in the United States this landmark cruised into its thirteenth year on the Billboard LP list in the spring of 1986. Equally incredible, it was then in the Top 10 of that magazine's compact disc chart, the oldest LP to feature. This album even gave "the Floyd" their first US hit single, "Money," with the "shit" conspicuously bleeped out. But what is most phenomenal about this record is that, without any overt promotion or marketing, it evolved from being the quintessential "head" album to a prize atmospheric piece. In the so-called New Age, well-recorded psychedelia sounds right. The credits on the label say it all: "Pink Floyd Music Publ. Lyrics by Roger Waters Music by Pink Floyd Produced by Pink Floyd." In 1987, Dark Side of the Moon was chosen by a panel of rock critics and music broadcasters as the #15 rock album of all time. - Paul Gambaccini, The Top 100 Rock 'n' Roll Albums of All Time, Harmony Books, 1987. Released in 1973, this album was still on the Billboard pop charts in 1986 after selling more than ten million copies in the United States alone. The original, and obviously most enduring, of the Seventies English concept-art rock albums. The eclectic techno-sound was very much attributable to the contribution of Alan Parsons, the project's Abbey Road engineer, the saxophone of Dick Perry, and Clair Torry's expressive, wordless vocals. Dark Side of the Mood has become, perhaps, the essential icon of Seventies rock. The sound quality depends on which of the two versions (Capitol or Harvest) is heard. The import Harvest release affords much the superior sound -- fuller, more rounded with significantly reduced tape hiss. The initial Capitol version was still a spatial and dynamic enhancement over the LP, but suffered from some muddiness and much more annoying hiss than the Harvest recording which, interestingly enough, runs four seconds longer. A- - Bill Shapiro, Rock & Roll Review: A Guide to Good Rock on CD, 1991. Pink Floyd's instrumental prowess and mastery of sound effects, married for the first time to bassist Roger Waters' lyrics about madness, "Time," "Money," and other concerns make for the most impressive mood music of the decade (and sales of 25 million copies so far.) * * * * * - William Ruhlmann, The All-Music Guide to Rock, 1995. Dark Side of the Moon is the essential Pink Floyd piece, a seamless and inventive song cycle bolstered by a three-dimensional soundscape of instruments and special effects -- not to mention some first-rate songs like "Money," "Us and Them" and "Time." * * * * * - Gary Graff, Musichound Rock: The Essential Album Guide, 1996. It starts and ends with a heartbeat. In between, Pink Floyd created a suite of songs united by the themes of madness, ageing and death. It sold over 20 million copies. Roger Waters' lyrics are unremittingly bleak: witness "Time." Elsewhere Waters tackles materialism ("I'm all right Jack keep your hands off my stack" -- "Money") and insanity ("There's someone in my head but it's not me" -- "Brain Damage"). But like the prism on the famous sleeve, creating a spectrum of colour, out of all the pessimism comes some truly memorable music. A lush richness characterizes the album. "Money," announced by ringing tills, features a classic off-kilter riff, squidgy synths, Dick Parry's rock'n'roll sax and a stratosphere-scraping Gilmour solo. "Us and Them" sets church organ, sensitive guitar picking and jazzy sax against a meditation on war and homelessness, ending in a beguiling morass of delayed synth sounds. The theme of insanity in "Brain Damage" inevitably recalls Floyd founder member Syd Barrett; the snippets of laughter are particulary unsettling. Snippets of futuristic synths, tape loops, distant explosions, crazy dialogue and footsteps panning between the speakers frame the conventional songs, and made the album perfect for headphone listening and the early 70s' hi-fi boom. Misery never sounded so good. - Collins Gem Classic Albums, 1999. "I think every album was a step towards Dark Side of the Moon," keyboardist Rick Wright said. "We were learning all the time, the techniques of the recording and our writing was getting better." As a culmination of their inner-space explorations of the early 1970s, the Floyd toured the bulk of Dark Side in Britain for months prior to recording. But in the studio, the band articulated bassist Roger Waters' lyric reveries on the madness of everyday life with melodic precision ("Breathe," "Us and Them") and cinematic lustre (Clare Torry's guest vocal aria "The Great Gig in the Sky"). Dark Side is one of the best-produced rock albums ever, and "Money" may be rock's only Top Twenty hit in 7/8 time. Dark Side of the Moon was chosen as the 43rd greatest album of all time by the editors of Rolling Stone magazine in Dec. 2003. - Rolling Stone, 12/11/03.    Dark Side Of The Moon  is Pink Floyd's greatest & the greatest album ever created, hands down. If there is a album that is greater than  Dark Side Of The Moon , then shoot me right now. You have to listen to this from the beginning to the end, because this album will get you hooked onto Pink Floyd &amp; hooked onto this album. You will be listening to this album till the day you die. You will be singing lyrics and saying  'Don't give me that do goody god bullshit!' ,  'There is no Dark Side Of The Moon, really,matter of fact its all dark!' , & 'I'll see on The Dark Side Of The Moon!' in conversations everyday.   Dark Side Of The Moon  was released on March 24, 1973, &amp; since, has become the most successful albums of all time, selling in excess of 35 million copies worldwide. To celebrate 30th anniversary of this classic & groundbreaking album,  Dark Side Of The Moon  was reissued on March 31, 2003 as a Hybrid SACD combining a remastered stereo version, &amp;, for the first time, a mindblowing 5.1 Surround Sound mix. Also reissued to celebrate the anniversary of this classic record will be the vinyl version in its original packaging.  The album is listed in the Guiness Book of World Records for being on the charts longer than any other album in history, namely 591 weeks or 11.4 years in Billboard top 200! A total of approx 14 whole years (741 weeks) in & back in the top 200, &amp; a staggering 26 years insome Billboard chart or rather.  SoundScan, the chart tabulators in the US, listed the top 200 selling albums in 2002.  Dark Side  was once again on that list. It sold roughly 417,000 copies in the US in 2002, making it the 200th top selling album. It is by far the oldest album on the list.  The original title for the album was  Eclipse (A Piece for Assorted Lunatics) . The band were upset to find out that the proggressive rock act  Medicine Head  had released an album with the title  'Dark Side of the Moon'  as recently as 1972 on John Peel's Dandelion label. Since the release was was less than succesful sales-wise, the band decided to go with their plans.  The music & lyrics for the entire album were written during a seven week period in which the band were preparing for a tour in which they desperately wanted to premier new material.  The slide guitar heard on  Breathe  was a pedal steel that  David Gilmour  purchased in a pawn shop in Seattle back in 1968.  Australia radio listeners voted the album the best album to have sex to in 1990.   Dark Side Of The Moon  is such a great album that every song on the album should be on their greatest hits album.

       urlLink RHAPSODY Link          Meddle  is Pink Floyd's first album into their 70's rock era. With the albums hard rock song  One Of These Days , there is a message that some says. The message is,  'One of these days, i'm going to cut you into little pieces!'  From then on, everytime Pink Floyd plays  One Of These Days  they have a floating pig with it in concert. Other great songs are  A Pillow Of Winds ,  Fearless ,  San Tropez , &  Seamus .  Fearless  includes  'You'll Never Walk Alone' , Pink Floyd's finest moment.  San Tropez  is about a private island, and  Seamus  is about David Gilmour's hound. But no-one can forget their final &amp; greatest song from the album,  Echoes . This 20 minute horror-comic opening cut includes weird sonds and awesome guitar solos.  Echoes  went on to be named Pink Floyd's best of album in 2001. -Richard Dasher

It begins with the 24 minute song, Atom Heart Mother, written by Mason, Gilmour, Waters, Wright, and Geesin. The songs starts with a long time of silence, and the starts with weird sounds and then awesome playing by everybody. The album's second song If, written by Roger Waters, keeps a great guitar playing by David Gilmour and great singing by Roger Waters. The album's third song Summer '68, written by Rick Wright, it has a great guitar playing and singing, and a part of a singing duet and awesome guitar playing, this part keeps popping up thru the whole song. Fat Old Sun, written by David Gilmour, is a gret song from David Gilmour. A combination of his great voice, guitar, drums, keyboards, and bass. The best part is the electric guitar solo. The final song Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast, written by Mason, Gilmour, Waters, and Wright, doesn't have any lyrics, but is great with the sounds of Alan cooking breakfast and keyboards. This song is the first and I think only of its kind. Switching from Pink Floyd playing, to Alan in the kitchen. This album was founded off of the fact that a woman had a atom for a heart. -Richard Dasher

The 5th song has guitar playing lyrics for the first of the album, but the most amazing is his 2nd song (the 6th from the total) has animal sounds and weird pict sounds. The 7th, 8th, &amp; 9th songs are from guitar great, David Gilmour. Now his songs have great guitar playing (as usual, because he is the greates around) and great bass playing and other weird sounds, and great lyrics. The last songs on the first record (10th, 11th, & 12th) are from Nick Mason with flutes, drums, and other weird sounds, but no lyrics. The only songs that have lyrics are Granchester Meadows, from Roger Waters, &amp; The Narrow Way: Part 3, from David Gilmour. The Second side has four of there greates tunes fromthat time. The cool thing is that they played them much harder from the studio album and differentlly. The was the first album from Pink Floyd without there former frontman Syd Barret, who was forced to leave from many doses of LSD (which was legal back then). The LSD made Syd flip-out &amp; he was never focused half the time. -Richard Dasher

Jugband Blues     A Saucerful of Secrets is an awesome album with flat-out space rock songs. The first song 'Let The Be More Light' has a morse-code space message in it in the beginning. Another great song is 'Remember A Day' is a great relax song that they created. 'Set The Contols For The Heart Of The Sun' is creepy as hell and very awesome. 'Bike' & ' A Saucerful Of Secrets' is awesome with weird sounds connected to create a masterpiece. -Richard Dasher

Interstellar Overdrive 8. The Gnome 9. Chapter 24 10. Scarecrow 11. Bike  This was Pink Floyd's very first album. The album starts off with a bang with the space hit  'Astronomy Domine' . The songs are cool with weird sounds and odd gesters. The album came from the brilliant mind of Roger 'Syd' Barret, and you can tell by the music being in a world of the insane, space travel, and mice on bikes. -Richard Dasher
