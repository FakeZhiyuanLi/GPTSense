      well, we're done w/ our first two days of band camp. It was, well, um, fun....., it's hot outside, but nevertheless it was kinda fun. For anyone who wants to know i have not started my summer reading, i am assuming that if u r not a complete stranger that you could've guessed it, but oh well. G/T rules. Geeks rule. Ya, i'm bored, so i'm just talking. IM me please, but not from 8-10:30 or 12-3 on weekdays, cause we have band then. E-mail me or something, please, have not talked to a lot of peeps all summer. DW7777 is SN and  urlLink DW7777@aol.com  is E-mail, that's simple enough. Talk 2 y'all sometime

      I haven't posted in a while due to exesive homework on the first few days of school!!!!!!!!! Anyways, school is kinda fun, band is cool except for the few people that can't march worth shit, i think we all know who I'm talking about, ok maybe not all of u know her, but anyways, her name starts with an L ends w/ an N and Daniel Mata is "going out" w/ her. Although they are "going out" they have never actually gone out, they just talk at school, Daniel has better relationships w/ guys.
