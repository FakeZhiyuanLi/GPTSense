      A friend of mine told me that blogging is just for people who dont have lives...but i think some of us just have an ingrained desire to write and attract attention to ourselves...or it could be that blogging is the ultimate activity for desk-bound workers in this country who exercize an increasingly endangered personal freedom to say anything we want.

      now that i am listening to npr in the morning instead of hip-hop, r and b, and old-school, i am very much worried.  a few days ago i thought that it would be impossible for bush to win the election but now im not so sure.  theres the florida problem again.  i also think that it is hard to get a sense of the direction the nation is moving in from the bay area.  i dont know how useful it is to go to meet-ups or rallies or fund-raisers in this area.  instead of preaching to the choir, i think the efforts should be increased in the swing states.  i would like to go on a 'logic train' campaign across the country and sit down with undecided voters and speak to them.  but this requires critical thought and intelligence...  which brings me to a bigger almost blasphemous notion:  is democracy really that great?  the admin trumpets it all over the world (even though many countries are not ready for democracy) as if it could be implemented as a shake-and-bake set-up (easy bake democracy oven...ready in five minutes or less!!).  if you look at two of the longest periods of peace in the world (amongst large, diverse populations), you will see that neither of them was under a democracy.  im referring specifically to the reign of akbar during the mughal dynasty in india and the pax romana under augustus c.  the former peace was under muslims and the latter, pagans.  the problem with democracy is that currently it does not assume the votership to be educated or possess critical thinking.

      this is my first ever blog!  hot.  as a matter of etiquette, from what i have noticed in the recent 3 years, i believe that someone with a cell phone who uses it to call people but then turns it off should be reprimanded.  as if its her one way paging system.  fuck that.  if someone says to you that they are like the brother or sister that they never had, this should be a warning sign that the person might be missing the 'non-codependent' screw.  why do people fawn over clinton?  hes a fake liberal...im sorry, but i just cant take the guy:  hes sleezy slick like his wife and if you look at his presidency, its pretty bad.  nafta?  bad.  multi-fold increase in drug incarcerations?  heinous.  iraq?  bad.  economics?  just short of the republican agenda it seems.  the one good thing about clinton is that he just didnt care what people thought...
