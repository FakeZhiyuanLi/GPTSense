      Still up from last night. Nightmarish creatures loom out of the fog, then I realise that theses freaks of nature are us. So many memories and none that make sense. There’s no turning back, not now. The only way to solve this predicament is to keep drinking and guzzle more drugs. More drugs there’s a peaceful notion about those 2 words. A solace that they will pull me through.

      I have just finished reading Hells Angels by Hunter Thompson. It truly is a great book. Despite all the violence that the Angels surrounded themselves with you care for them. Through all the pain and anguish they inflicted, through all the rape and stomping you have a confusing weakness for them.  At the end of the book you feel raped; something has been torn from the reader. I’ve found this with all of Hunter’s books. He does it with unnerving ease. If only every book left feeling like this.

      I’m feeling quite depressed at the moment. But it’s rather bizarre. A girl I used to work with is leaving in a couple of weeks and moving to London. I was never emotionally or physically attracted to her but am somewhat sadden by her leaving and the thought of never seeing her again. Even though like I said I was never that close to her. Why do I feel like this? I’ve had much closer friends move away and haven’t experienced this. Does this therefore mean that subconsciously I was closer to her than I realised? I don’t’ know. All I can say for sure is at the current time I am left with an empty heart.

      What a fuckin great weekend. Not only did I manage to blow £70 in the pub Saturday night and NOT get pissed. Can some please explain to me how this possible?   Today I twisted my soding ankle while playing cricket which now hurts like hell. This also means I can’t drive very well (not that I could before) because it’s so fuckin painful when I use the clutch.   All in all a pretty crap weekend.

      I can’t believe that we have to pay £115 (I think) every year so we have the right to watch television. As far as I am aware no other country does this. To be fair the BBC do quite a good job at keeping me entertained but I don’t see why I should pay over ton each year when all other television channels acquire their revenue by advertising. There really is some shite on TV. At some point someone has sat down and said “You know what that would make good television.” For instance on ITV 1 tonight we have The Tallest People In Britain. How can this possibly be compelling viewing? However this is nothing to the latest fad. Reality TV is possibly the cheapest way to make a program. For this you will require a location (obviously) a house, jungle, island or now a kitchen. Simply place cameras in every conceivable place now all you need is a bunch of social misfits or Z list celebs that no one even knew existed. Lock the door and wait. What is produced is absolute horse shit. I realise that people as creatures are naturally voyeuristic so the chance to scrutinize others is too good to miss. But please, have you got nothing better to do with your life? Not only does Big Brother dominate TV it also dominates the press for however long the fucking thing is on for. And then the freak that’s won is force fed to us for a further 6 months by appearing on every show, in every paper and magazine. Before the winner finally drifts from the media spot light and back into obscurity and insignificance. I can confidently say that television and particularly realty TV sucks ass.  However after saying all that I spend several hours a week sitting in front of it. Hypocritical I think so but aren't we all?

      Currently getting pissed on Absinthe. This stuff can not be good for you. But anyhow it’s doing a job and a fucking good one at that. I’ve had quite a quiet weekend for once. Had a couple of drinks and a few joints last night and tonight it’s been much of the same until the Absinthe arrived on the scene. Of course this will all change tomorrow. England play France at Euro 2004. Kick off is at 7.45pm that means I can get a full day’s drinking in before we even kick off. It also means I can get a full day of drug abuse in. Fucking hell Absinthe is rotten. It’s starting to kick in now. Anyway….. I’ve forgotten what I was going to say. I suspect that the rest of the attempt to write will encounter such problems.  More Absinthe. Can someone please tell me why I do this? Its 70% abv. More? Yeah why not. I’m gonna drop a pill and fuck off now.

      I’ve had this problem for several years now. I first noticed it when I turned 18 and could legally buy alcohol and now its effects my drug taking. This problem is self control or rather the total lack of it that I seem to have.   The first time I noticed my lack of this important psychological function was in my second year at uni. After 2 years of legal drinking I become aware that out of all my friends I was the only who was regularly battered. By regularly I mean 3-4 times a week. (I wasn’t an alcoholic I didn’t and don’t need a drink to operate. I can go for a week or more without drinking and feel fine.) This continued into my third year and I still get pissed about twice a week 3 years after I left.  My self control or lack of became starkly obvious when I went to Las Vegas on a stag party for 4 days in June 2003. After drinking for 3 solidly I embarked on a 20 hour coke binge. By the end of the mammoth session I was having to psych myself up for 5 minuets before doing the line.   Even now anybody could place any alcohol or drug on a table in front of me I would have a hard time resisting it. In fact I couldn’t. This will be my down fall, my inability to say no.  I think the major reason as to why I get completely skulled every weekend is I don’t get hangovers. Never, I wake up and can keep going if I want regardless of what I’ve done the night before. More often than not I will get up and carry on this is because I feel I might miss out on something if I don’t kick the arse out of it. Whatever the something might be I want to be there, apart of it.   This is why I can never say no.

      Last night was supposed to be a quiet one. Indeed it did start like that; I went round to a mate’s house to pick up 15 garys and have a couple of joints. However that all changed when another mate called round with a gram of coke. That quickly disappeared between the 3 of us. Then out came the pills. We decided to drop a whole. Never a good idea really but sod it live for life the moment. Christ knows what time a got home four, five?   “I got to stop doing this”.   That is a statement often said by me. Its not just once a while a get fucked off me head on drugs its every weekend. Guess what I’m doing tonight. That’s right going out to consume vast amounts of drugs, and I’ll do the same next weekend.  You know what its got to stop.

      I've just discovered that a virus called Netsky.p is making a come back because it disguise itself as a Harry Potter game. The world would be a better place without the pesky gobshite.

      I FUCKING hate Harry Potter! I’ve never read any of the books so I can’t moan & rant about how shite the books are or why a prepubescent knob jockey has become such a hit. What I do loathe about the butt munch is the hype that surrounds the release of the books and the movies. I can honestly say that I have never pissed myself with excitement about a movie or a new book coming out. I used to work at Borders and the amount of crap that would follow the annoying little shit around was colossal. I realise that this is all part of the marketing machine that follows any popular film/book/TV show. But for god sake is there really any need to have trading cards, board games, hat and fucking scarf set. PLEASE! Can’t the little freak sod off to what ever hovel he crawled from. My final point as to why he should just FUCK OFF is when the first book came out (and I could mistaken here) there were only supposed to be another 2 books but as if by magic (no pun intended) a further 2 books turn up how fucking apt is that.   JK ROWLING YOU’RE A WHORE. YOU’VE SOLD YOUR SOUL TO THE DEVIL.

      What ever you don’t go and waste 2 hours of your life watching The Day After Tomorrow. Its shite, you can never get those 2 hours back. Or the six quid you had to fork out to the thieving pig fuckers that run the cinema. If anyone enjoyed this film please let me know so I can kick fuck out of you. YOU NEED TO GET A LIFE!   The problem with people is that they fuckin irritate me. Take today for instance some dim-witted old white haired cow decided the best way to arrive at her destination was to walk down the middle of the FUCKING road. For god sake woman use the bleeding pavement that’s what they’re there for.

      A while back I had a rant about television well I have just discovered the most pointless and fucking god awful program ever. On Channel 5 at the moment is Movie Mistakes Uncovered Uncut which is presented by what can only be described as a knob head. His name is Rob Deering. Apparently the fat fucking unfunny twat is a fucking comedian. Oh my god. I’ve funnier things at an execution. He is positively annoying. I have unfortunately watched this excuse for a program for 30 minutes I have yet to even smile.   Is it really going to befit my existence&nbsp;to know&nbsp;that in Reservoir Dogs some cops run pass the same building 3 times. NO IT FUCKING WON’T. I can’t believe people make this crap. It’s absolutely fucking inept. I hope I never see this shite ever again.

       Lately because TV has been a fuckin disgrace I have started listening to an awful lot of radio. Unfortunately it would appear that radio has gone the same way as TV. What the fuck is happening to the world? Just when you think you’ve found salvation some fascist bastard decides to fuck it up.  &nbsp;  On top of this annoyance I have got terrible back pain. I have no idea were this has come from but at the moment I’m incapacitated. Unfortunately I’m going to Chibuku on Saturday to see Layo &amp; Bushwacka after I might add playing cricket. That’s gonna be fun.

      Do your self a favour and don’t go and see Highwaymen. This is possible the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure to witness. I thought The Day After Tomorrow was shite, fuck me you ain’t seen nothing yet. There is not one redeeming feature of this film. Its slow, boring and doesn’t involve the viewer at all. The only other movie I can think of that is this dreadful is Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. At some point in time someone sat down and thought “That’s a great idea for a film. Let’s make it”. Its described as a horror thriller. Well the horror is the abysmal movie and the thrill finally arrives when you see the credits. Save your money and an hour & a half of your life.

      Sunday night was the first time I trashed a hotel room. The Croft Hotel in Bridgenorth was the unhappy recipient of me and my 3 mates. After a 30th birthday party we retired to one of our 2 rooms and proceeded to cause complete and utter devastation. Once we had managed to knock over numerous vodka & cokes or whiskey & cokes and several classes of RED wine the carpet didn’t look to healthy. To the mix was added a significant dose of cigarette ash and tobacco from many failed attempts to make joints. When this was complete Gaz managed to burn a hole in the carpet and 3 large holes in the duvet with a joint. As the icing on the cake one of us I can’t remember who contrived to break the table sitting in the middle of the room. How the hotel manager will take this damage to his establishment I don’t know. The four of us paid the bill and did one before he could survey the extent of the destruction. The amount of noise we made the entire night I don’t know how anyone staying there could have got a decent night’s sleep.   I will be staying away from The Croft for the foreseeable future and more than likely Bridgenorth too.

      Today I went to watch Michael Moore's propaganda movie Fahrenheit 9/11. I must say I hate Michael Moore. The shit he spreads is outrageously. I can't be arsed to write much more about the fat, lying cock. Instead check out the website below and help destroy the myth that Michael Moore is a high quality journalist.    urlLink MOOREWATCH - Watching Michael Moore's every move

      Been going off on one lately. Lots of random rants about nothing. I discovered for instance yesterday that you can get white pudding. Now I know what black pudding is made from blood. So what the fuck is white pudding made out of? If anybody knows could you please let me know? Other random events have included wanting to buy a chinchilla, feeling it necessary to engage in discussing the pros and cons of Kahlua and for a reason I can’t work out Pritt Stick. Having said that I don’t think I want to know why I’m discussing such bizarre items, also why my friends want to talk about these weird objects. These absurd debates take place far too often. So much so that I have started to carry a Dictaphone around with me so I can play back such discussions. Some of the tapes make for interesting listening. Maybe I should upload them to my website. Actually best not I would be carted off to the loony bin.

      For those of you who read this you’ll be disappointed to know that I’m in fact still alive. Not that anyone would read the bollox that I spew out here. I’ve been rather busy getting pissed since Thursday.   Over the weekend I managed to appreciate how utterly shite my life is. I can’t get a bird, my tolerance to alcohol has gone through the roof as has my drug habit and I’m skint. On Saturday I drank 10 cans of larger, half a bottle of vodka and had 5 Absinthe. I’m in fear now. How can I possible continue like this? I’m on a path to obliteration, and soon, very soon. You know what I don’t care. I have very little to look forward to at the moment. Depression is an absolute bitch.   I’m going to the pub to get battered and fantasize about a life I wish I had but can.

      Great day yesterday. I managed to fail my IT exam which I had to pay £100 for. I’m absolutely skint so now I’ve got to find another ton for the next fuckin time I take it. BOLLOX.  I did play squash as well yesterday but that fucked me up. My ankle has gone again so looks like I need to see the physiotherapist and while I’m there she can sort out my back which is giving me shit again.
