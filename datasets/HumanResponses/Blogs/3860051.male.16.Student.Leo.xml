       Make her go away,   This girl I know her name is Angela, she is obsessed with me.   By obsessed I mean persistent in the manner of trying to screw me when she knows I dislike her greatly.   I've tried everything I can think of,   I've tried telling her to leave me alone, I've said I have a girlfriend,   and I've been trying to avoid her at all cost.   She calls me everyday, which is what my mother tells me.   But luckely for me I've been at my friends house everyday since Summer School ended so    I haven't had to talk to her. She pesters me on my xanga site as well as my livejournal.   I might as well just keep avoiding her and make new accounts on those sites.   Luckely she knows not of this site.   She is the queen of gross and most of friends think that I like her when I tell them this.   She has a boyfriend and still she bugs the crap out of me and trys to climb all over me.   I've actually almost vomited on her before when she touched my hand.   PLEASE HELP ME WITH YOUR ADVICE!

       Hello, I just got back from swimming, well I didn't just get back I've been home for about an hour. Yesterday I rented Animal Crossing for GameCube. At first it seemed pretty boring but after awile it seemed to get more interesting. My favorite part of the game would have to be the fack that you can design your own clothing wit hwhat ever you want. I made a black shirt that said Hyde,Smile,and 666. It looked cool but I thought I could do better. Anyway tommorow I'm having Erica and Mike come over for awile, The three of us are going to hang out in my room until my parents leave with my sister, then will probabley go down stairs to watch tv. Or just stay in my romm because I've got cable in my room as well as downstairs so it doesn't really matter. Within the next two or three weeks I'm going to try and have David, Courtney, and Lydia come over for a couple of hours. Were going to watch anime and listean to my new LEN cd "Smile" .I'de invite more people but the people I want to invite aren't here and Mike and Erica can't come because they'll be out of town for two weeks. They'll be leaving this Saturday. Which remindes me, i have to go to my grandpa's this weekend and mow his lawn for a few extra bucks. For my little get-to-gether, I think we'll watch my anime Ceres and if Lydia can bring over some more anime that would be cool. I don't have alot of anime. I'll I have I think is Cowboy Bebop, Ceres, some Zoids thing, and damn, thats about it. Shit, I need to go buy some more anime. AdultSwim is really cool, Having Family and Futurama plus 2-3 hours of anime is just the best damn idea anyone ever came up with...besides condoms and porn. My cats are locked in battle at the moment so I'll have to break that up.Nothing really exicting going at my house. Tommorow is gonna be fun and I think on friday I'll call D,C,L to see if they actually can come over. If they can't I'll be pretty upset but I'll get over it...I hope. Well I guess this is the end of my long post, I'll write something later this week if I get the chance. Bye For Now!
