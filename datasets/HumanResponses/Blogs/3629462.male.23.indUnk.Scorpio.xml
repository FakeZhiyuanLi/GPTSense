      Well, there I went, to the  urlLink Dillinger Escape Plan  gig, with the bass player and lead singer of my band. We saw  urlLink The Psyke Project  warm up, thinking, "Man, that was worth the ticket fee alone," and then Dillinger come out and completely trash the place. My hearing has yet to fully recover, because I didn't bring ear plugs, figuring they could be readily bought at the venue (guess that showed me).  After the gig, we had a nice little chat with Dillinger's drummer, and I got his John Hancock. Really nice bloke; I mean,  really  nice. It was almost like he didn't want  us  to leave.  All in all, good gig.  Went home yesterday to take care of laundry and, on the way, pick up a  tent , which is kind of  essential equipment for spending a week outdoors . So now that's taken care of. This is going to be one hell of a vacation. Screw the warm South; I'll take a festival any day.

      Yesterday was spectacularly uneventful, in the sense that my girlfriend called in "sick" (as in, I suspect, sick of going to work), so we spent the whole day at home (save for a shop-stop), baking bread, making frosted cakes, and generally just relaxing. Plus, we slept until something like 3pm. Days like that don't come often enough.  Although tempting, we couldn't exactly repeat that stunt today, so she went off to work, while I stayed home, conversing with the lead singer of my band about our numerous side projects. And that's basically it. I did a little  urlLink hush-hush webpage  for him with abandoned/unfinished midi sketches, which may or may not find their way onto our latest nerd-project,  urlLink Ordinary Fraud . In fact, the whole project's pretty much hush-hush, given that we don't want people associating it with our  urlLink main band , and the fact that this new band is comprised of myself, him, and our ex-guitarist. I think it's all because  a)  we don't want the comparison, because this new project is somewhat serious, and  very  musically diverse from our main band,  b)  the secrecy's fun. So there you have it.  Heh, this secret blog is tons'o'fun. The things I can write and get away with.

      Well, even though none of us wanted to ever get up, my girlfriend has to go to Copenhagen and pick up her long-lost mobile phone. Meanwhile, I've stayed home and done a spot of tidying up. Plus, I've probably managed to upset a few neighbors in the creation of another spectacularly unlistenable  urlLink Kapitalen Klash  track, "Ordinary".  Yesterday, after watching a  urlLink spectacularly confused movie , she unexpectedly started crying and then fell asleep. Wouldn't tell me what it was about. Makes you think.

      Well, I borrowed money from my parents and rushed to my apartment, where my girlfriend had been camping out for nearly six hours, on account of not having brought a key. Before that, I had the pleasure of witnessing my brother at what was possibly his drunkest moment ever. And that's not even a word, 'drunkest', but this is my diary, and I'll write what I want. If Trent Reznor can invent words on the spot, record them and pretend they're real, so can I.  Oh well. The party I mentioned went off, and I was there, drunker than fuck, and while I was having fun, dancing around to dumb 80s music with my best friends, smoking strawberry tobacco and being accused of alcoholism, my girlfriend was having the dullest time of her life. So I feel kinda bad about that, but still, I'm glad she was there, and at least she got to witness two of my best friends drink half a liter of absinthe and then start railing about the intricate levels of idiocy in Danish pop-rap music.  I spent a sizable portion of the night playing a bongo drum very loudly with some guy named Rune, and I dimly recollect aiding a crippled, wheelchair-bound ex-classmate of mine consume vodka drinks.  The end of the party wasn't as good, however, as we were told there was no place to sleep, even though we were in the middle of nowhere with no buses or other means of transportation for at least four hours. Finally, we managed to bum our way to Holbaek central station (about a 30 minute drive, which would've taken us maybe two or three hours to walk), where we &mdash; upon realizing that the next form for transportation was still a good couple of hours away &mdash; stopped for a late-late- late -night kebab. It was about four in the morning at this point. Sure enough, once the kebab has been consumed, my two accompanying friends fall asleep against each others shoulders, in what can only be described as a horifically beautiful moment.  I summon my courage, call my parents, and mercifully, my dad agrees to drive my girlfriend and I to our apartment ... which is another thirty minute drive.  I think I owe my dad a big hug and maybe a bottle of wine or something.

      Not much today. I've created three mix tapes for the Roskilde festival (of which one side is blank, should we choose to ape up and record some craziness at the camp).  I should've been with Lasse, buying canned goods and ensuring a cheap Roskilde, food-wise, but my timetable's gone tits up. See, it's the traditional "riding-around-in-a-huge-truck-and-visiting-every-classmembers-family-whilst-drinking-ungodly-amounts-of-beer" day for the graduates, meaning that my kidbrother must currently be on his umpteenth beer. I wanted to be here when he shows up at our home, which turns out to be somewhere like half past seven ...  And that's what screwed up my timetable.  Oh well, I don't think those canned goods will mind me picking them up at a later date.  Tomorrow's a party, and I really want to go. Several questions need to be answered first; most of them involving financials. God, I hate being out of work. Poverty is the ultimate ill.

      Well, I didn't end up partying like it was the year 2000, since I was told that, should I set foot on the premise and not be a current year graduate, I would immediately be booted from the premises. So I stayed and got drunk on wine with the folks instead, whilst gorging myself with grilled delights. Such is life.  Right now, I'm nostalgically (if that's a word) perusing the old audio archives of  urlLink the Kurv , dreaming of those magical moments on stage where we tore everything up, including our old guitarists strings. Man, I wish we could do that  now , and with that I mean,  this very minute  ... but maybe we should write some new material with our new guitarist first, and see where that takes us. But I so love getting whiplash behind the drums. Oh yeah.  Roskilde, come soon. I need the vacation.  Bed time it is.

      I've just returned from my kidbrothers graduation, which was such a formulaic, dull experience that I was glad I got drunk first.  Thankfully, there was alcoholic sips at the ensuing reception-thingy (of which I managed to snag three), and maybe there's even the chance of me appearing later.  Which is when things start to get fun.  Hooray.  Right now, it's celebratory sips of wine with CO2 ... and a phone call to see if this night turns out fun.

      My girlfriend was out last night, so I shared a bottle of wine with a friend of mine. Then he left, and I shared the next bottle with myself. Then, I walked to town and requisitioned a third bottle. And upon my return, I spent the entire evening listening to loud music, watching music videos, and harrassing the lead singer of my band on IRC.  Now, I am one hung over honky, waiting for my folks (and widow grandmother) to come pick me up, which will happen in approximately twenty minutes.  In other news, I've managed to get  urlLink WordPress  up and running. Now I just need to learn how to configure it, and I can escape this blogging hell once and for all. Muhahahahaaa!  (I was planning on spending the morning doing a nauseating  urlLink Kapitalen Klash -track, using the Futurama sample in this posts title as a starting point, but I couldn't find the sample anywhere, so my inspiration left me. Oh well. I think the world has enough noisy half-assed hungover industrial music for now, anyway.)

      The score appears to be even. Just as I figured out how to prevent Blogger from bitching about an 'access denied' every time I tried to enable archiving or XML feed (so  that's  what that path window was for), Blogger one-ups me with another irritation.  Notice the bulleted lists below? Notice how the text below the lists suddenly aren't line-spaced correctly? Now, I know this is a CSS error, but I'll be damned if I can find my way around that See-Ess-Cesspool this silly blog template uses. I've tried a number of "ul, li { line-height:whatever }" permutations, but it only fucked up the layout even more. At this point, I'm saying screw it. Once that MySQL user/pass thing arrives, it's bye-bye Blogger, and into the real world for me.  So - Blogger scores by still having an annoying comments system, and now, apparently, can't keep track of its own layout.  I score by being a big dunce and figuring out how to enter  the full ftp path in my settings , and also by enabling both an  urlLink Atom  and  urlLink RSS  XML feed (look to your left).  The saga continues (to bore).

      How's this for precognition?  Today I'll go to town, pick up my last pay check (before the temp agency courteously kicked my ass to the curb for their own devious, economic ends&mdash;do I sound bitter?), then do the following things with it:    Pay my half of the rent. (1800 kr.)  Buy my ticket to the Roskilde Festival. (1150 kr.)  Buy a ticket for the  urlLink Dillinger Escape Plan  gig next Wednesday. (115 kr.)   Of course, this scenario implies that there is money enough for all three, so in the heartbreaking likelihood that there isn't, I've categorised them by priority.  Then, it's back to the den and patiently await being picked up by my parental units, who will escort me to the festive, colorful and not-at-all-fucking-dull event of my kidbrother graduating. Let's hope there's beer.  Oh, and if all goes well, I'll stop by my friend and pay off the 350 kr. for Roskilde beverages. But that's stretching believability already.   Edit (16/6):  Both tickets  and  the rent money have now been taken care of. The 350 kr. for the beer, however, that's another story. I'll have to sort that out tomorrow.

      Watched Gary Sinise tromp around a futuristic landscape in a Philip K. Dick-inspired film,  urlLink Impostor . Had fun, but it was a bit too long, not nearly enough exposition, and the double-whammy-surprise ending just felt like they were trying too much. Still, when you consider that it was originally intended as a 30-minute short film that was expanded into a two-hour feature for little or no reason other than "if thirty concise minutes of fast-paced action-scifi-paranoia is cool, then 120 minutes of it must be  four times  as cool!" ... then it's all right.  At least I didn't get the  urlLink re-rated from R to PG-13 version . That could've really finished me off.  Other than that, I've been harassing my friends, listening to  urlLink Morrissey  (there's a secret reason behind that which I'll tell you later), and whining about this blog-thing.

      This whole Blogger setup had better just be temporary. I'm desperately trying to reach my sysadmin and forcing the database details out of him, so I can set up  urlLink WordPress  or  urlLink Movable Type .  This Blogger thing's cool, but there are a number of things I dislike. Just minor things, you know, such as ...    The archiving system doesn't work when uploading to a personal ftp. All I get is an "access denied to file" when I try to enable archiving. Fun.  The xml-feed, although I wouldn't know what to do with it, also doesn't work. If I knew what possible use I might have for it, I'd  really  get upset. For now, I'm just disappointed.  The comments system is appalling. Also, I can't remember how to spell  'appalling' . Wait, I'll look it up. (paws) I was right. Phew. Anyway, nuts to the comments system. I just want a form and a comments window; not force whatever poor suckers that are actually reading this to go through a Blogger registration, or suffer having all their comments prefixed with the oh-so-telling username "Anonymous". Fuck that.   You know, little things.

      This must be the umpteenth time I've tried to get a working blog going. Don't ask me why I keep torturing myself like this.  I suppose the incentive, this time around, was that my paternal grandfather recently passed away, and my grandmother told me about the diary he kept. It wasn't an earthshatteringly profound and philosophical diary; it was just the "went to the yard, then had dinner" sort of diary. But &mdash; I'm the nostalgic type. I like to reminisce. I can't help it. I even look back at the old, failed attempts at blogging and think, "Oh, is  that  what I did that day? How cool." I even keep old photographs. I mean  really  old. Of people I don't even like. There, now you know it.  So I remembered why I even wanted to start a diary in the first place. Just to be able to go back, a year later, and think, "Oh, so that's what I was doing on that particular day." You know, the tried-and-true practice of wallowing in the past instead of keeping your head level on present day tasks. It all works out.  Which means I think I'm finally at peace with what this shit's supposed to be. It's not supposed to have any point. Therein lies the point, or rather, the absence-of-a-point of a diary. Truth be told, I'm not sure why I'm even publishing this online instead of writing it down in a calendar, and the only reason I can think of that'd answer that is, I don't have a calendar.  This'll be nothing more than a recap of what I've been doing. Nothing incredibly fancy. Just like any other blog.  Detractors may break my kneecaps now.

      So last night, the lead singer of my band and I got very drunk on red wine, went down to the dorm bar and asked if we could do a little late-night performance. So we dragged my stereo, keyboard, computer and his guitar and amplifier down there, played four or five songs for drunk hiphopsters, and had a blast. Then, they offered us a real gig with our real band while giving us a beer. The bar men, that is; the hiphopsters were just troublemakers and left shortly after we stopped playing (which they weren't really paying attention to, anyway).  Earlier this week, L. and I went to B.'s house and got trashed. Actually, we sat outside in the sun drinking beer in front of B.'s house for a good thirty minutes, because B. apparently went to the park with all his friends and forgot we were coming ... not that we're complaining. L. threw up early on and went to sleep (although, from all the noise we were making, he probably didn't get a lot), whilst someone managed to convince me and two others (including B.) to run around the house naked. Ah, to be young again... and also a robot.  My girlfriend is coming home today. Yay!

      My girlfriend has been gone for two days now, going on third, and now she's telling me she wants to stay another day to visit a friend of hers. Yeah. At least I got to say an extra goodbye, because she had to leave a day later than originally planned, and I just happened to run into her at the train station as she was leaving. Sometimes the sun just seems to shine a bit brighter, even when it isn't.  I was at work Friday; then I got absolutely drunk with my old friend (the one who was passing out muddy hugs at Roskilde). We watched cheesy anime, jumped around to Orgy and assorted punky delights, then fell asleep to an SVCD of Futurama episodes.  The next day, on Saturday, I was at work again for a few hours (we close at 3pm on Saturdays); then we repeated the process, sans the jumping around. On the other hand, we watched an absolutely spectacular piece of Japanese cinema, entitled  urlLink Mini Moni - The Movie , whilst drinking beer. To say that it didn't floor us would be to say that the ocean isn't sorta wet, but the real shocker didn't come until the credits had finished rolling (whilst amusing outtakes were shown), when one of the main characters appeared on screen, stuck her face obscenely close to the camera, and softly uttered: "To tell you the truth ... I'm a mango."  At that point, we realized that alcohol may have been too weak a drug of choice for us.  In other news, working at a record store has acquainted me with the following works of art that I am currently in the process of delving much, much deeper into:  Dillinger Escape Plan  - "Miss Machine"  Deadsy  - "Commencement"  Mnemic  - "Mechanical Spin Phenomenon"  Plus, I just got a hold of Tweaker's "2 AM Wakeup Call", though I haven't listened to it yet.  Shit, I miss her. A whole  week?!  Yeah, as if I need any  more  mental anguish.

      I've spent the last two days coming from work, stoned, making angry, angsty industrial music, as part of the band  urlLink Mekanik Kampf .  We've done two songs so far that are almost done, save for a few tweaks:   March Mein Führer  A reworking of an old track of our leadsinger's. He did most of the work; I did some synth; then we collaborated on editing and mixing.   Substance Abuse Whore  A new track, written from the ground up. I laid down probably half the beats, did most of the synth work, wrote 70% of the lyrics, and then we collaborated on editing and mixing this one as well.  And I've written the synth line for a third track, which is definitely in the silly 80's genre, so it'll probably be a hidden track or something. I laid the ground work for it yesterday (lead, bass, drum programming, for both verse and chorus, as well as an ambient intro), and he's tiddling with it now as we speak.  It's fun doing a project like this, because the guy is very serious and enthusiastic about the music. Lyrics-wise, it's the same ol' hate-the-world slop, but it's nice to be able to get rid of the last bits of teen angst that may still be left in me.

      Well, the lead singer of my band came by this weekend, which resulted in quite a number of interesting sonic experiments. Apparently, we're doing this concept album thing with a fictional group of 18-year olds, which is turning out quite oddly.  Then, Sunday, after he went home, I went home to my parents to have my disgustingly filthy clothes washed. We had some wine for the evening, then they drove me to my job this morning. Nice.  My girlfriend isn't home, unfortunately, because her job's being mean to her. And tomorrow, I'm heading over to join in on  yet another  musical collaboration, which is scheduled to go on for at least a week, so I'll scarcely be seeing her. That makes me sad.

      Barring my first day on the job, I've smoked weed every day I've been involved with this record store, which now counts four days and an afternoon (at the job interview).  My "supervisor", if you could call him that, seems pleased with the work I'm doing; we have the same tastes in music and humor (he also prefers  urlLink  Futurama   to  The Simpsons , and enjoys pissed-off American stand-uppers in the  urlLink Bill Hicks -tradition) ... and I don't seem to be screwing up too much.  Plus, we seem to be getting stoned every day.  I can't tell you where this is going, but not to worry; I think I'm responsible enough not to turn this into some required ritual or anything. I've already gotten that talk once about alcohol, and while I appreciate the concern (I think), I don't have an addictive personality.  But I do enjoy the after-work joints.  Or, as they seem to have turned out the past two days, the during-work joints.  Oh well.  As long as it doesn't affect our work, everybody's happy.  Even Mr. Big Shot.  Well, I wasn't planning on making excuses throughout this entry.  Everyone was psyched that Dave Grohl is playing drums for the new  urlLink NIN  record. And that one of our favorite albums,  The Downward Spiral , is being remixed in 5.1 stereo. Plans of having a little after-hour gettogether in-store are already in the works, even if the thing hasn't got a release date yet.  In other avenues, my desire to quit the temp job in the absolutely perfect manner actually led to me momentarily forgetting all about it.  It wasn't until the day before yesterday that the temp lady wrote me, asking what days of the week I wanted to work that stupid fucking job.  I wrote back, saying, "No days, really, 'cos I've found something much better."  So, this morning, she threw a mild temper at me, asking me why I was being so rude when they were "giving me a second chance" (since I was fired from the last temp job).  I wrote her back, incredulously, reaffirming that my firing had nothing to do with the quality of my job performance.  I didn't  have  to be rude, I know, but  a)  I'm still pissed at the way temp workers were being treated at that package gig I just left, and  b)  I don't need to be patronized by people who make their living pushing poor and desperate people around like the toilet paper of the workforce that they so clearly are.  Bollocks to that.  (Pardon the British slang;  urlLink Jamie Oliver  was just on.)  Anyway.  That's my life, so far.  Organizing CDs, smoking weed, and pissing off temp organizers.  And then, coming home to hug the 'wife' and getting a brilliant nights sleep.  I even installed  urlLink an alarm clock  on the computer, because my girlfriend wasn't home last night and she had brought the mobile phone with her that we use as an alarm clock.  It worked wonders last night.  This morning was slightly different, because my girlfriend and I need to get up at two different times, and &mdash; well, I don't know if I just fucked up, or if this program doesn't like having two instances of itself running simultaneously, but somehow the timer on one of the programs got switched to sometime during the afternoon, which is way off.  Oh well.  If it doesn't happen again, I'm chalking it down to my own ignorance.  And I love the fact that it's been written by a college student who was sick of being late to class; that just warms my heart, in some weird, perverse way.

      After work, not only the big boss (the guy with the job interview), but also the guy in charge of the local store I work at, got me stoned.  I guess that's how the music biz works.

      Things went well on my first day; no major screw-ups. I forgot to put a CD in a customers jewel case (don't I feel stupid), and a couple of "whoops, she paid with a credit card, even though I wrote cash", but, again, no major screw-ups. In fact, the other guys &mdash; a goth-kid whose been there seemingly forever, whom I've hung around quite a lot as a customer when things were slow; and a 15-year old blonde girl with an AC/DC fetish &mdash; seemed moderately impressed that I didn't fuck up as much. And that I seemed to be a fast learner.  Without a doubt, this beats that temp job by miles. I hope I can hang onto it. But the attitude is pretty relaxed (like I said, the guy who owns the lot got me stoned during my job interview), so I think it would take quite the Herculean fuck-up to get fired. Not that I have any intentions of finding out.  It's back tomorrow again at 10am. What a joy, too, to have normal work hours, for once.  On the short, five minute train ride home, I somehow got chatted up by this guy who turned out to be studying music in Copenhagen, and before I knew it, we were yapping away about all sorts of really nerdy technical stuff. Then, upon reaching the station, I run into one of my oldest friends (the guy who handed out muddy hugs at Roskilde), who was carrying two large bottles of Coke, on his way to play  Burnout 2  with my friend who lives across from my apartment. While they were ordering pizza in front of my impoverished, famished self, we watched two episodes of  The Simpsons . Then I went home to cook myself some dinner. Now I've just been invited to share a little after-work joint at another of my friends' apartment.  I'd better hang onto this day. It seems to be one of the rare ones where everything just clicks.

      I'm not exactly sure what this post title is supposed to mean, but who cares. It's late and I'm tired.  This weekend was all about music. After getting my head together from  urlLink the interview , I went to practice with  urlLink my band . It was great being behind a drum kit again. We rehearsed a number of old songs, took care of a little surprise (which goes by the secret title Brandon), and wrote an entirely new ending to  urlLink an old song .  Then, Saturday afternoon, the lead singer and I went back to my place for an evening of drink and general weirdness. This involved loud music and wine from cardboard cartons, plus an absolutely disappointing listening session of the first four tracks from the new The Cure album. And we even lit candles for that son of a bitch.  Just when we were starting to panic because we ran out of wine, my girlfriend came home, blind stinking drunk, from a party at one of her friends'. More wine all 'round and a good time was had by all. Eventually, we went to sleep.  I briefly awoke to the sounds of retching coming from the bathroom and noticed there was no one lying next to me, but I figured I didn't really want to be awake for that, and promptly went back to sleep.  Then, this morning, we all awoke, a little hung over. I finished off the remains of the wine whilst my lead singer and I composed a slow, orchestral dirgy-thing with a trial version of the latest version of FruityLoops (of which he is something of an expert, in my humble opinion). Then, he handed over the controls to me, and I furnished the thing with some MIDI synth.  Meanwhile, we tried to order pizzas, but because I'm such an idiot, they got the wrong address and, after a somewhat embarrasing phone call, we got three semi-cold pizzas &mdash; with the wrong toppings. Oh well.  Once we bid farewell to mister vocalist, I fired up Reason and proceeded to write the second part of the song. The finished result now clocks in at 8.54, and since this is a secret blog,  urlLink I have no qualms about sharing it here .  Now 'tis bedtime. In nine hours, I'll be at my new job. I'm looking forward to it. I still haven't decided what to do when that temp agency expects me to be at their shitty job Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, but I'll figure that out soon enough. My favorite scenario is to actually show up and quit in person, followed by a string of choice expletives and statements along the lines of "this is the worst fucking job I've ever had", but that probably won't mesh well with my new responsibilites.  But, like I said, soon enough. All I can say is, glee will be involved.

      "So there I was in Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon ..."  Well, actually, there I was, ready to kill myself because of my dead-end temp job. Maybe I'm being a bitch, which is quite likely, but me and Manual Labor just aren't the best of friends; especially not when it also gangs up with its friend, Stressful Environment. The long hours didn't help any, either. It's no fun getting off work at 11pm and not be home until sometime after midnight.  So I took a chance. I called up the aforementioned music store's headquarters in Copenhagen and queried about any job openings. I was asked to come in with a short sales pitch of myself in writing and shake hands with the manager. So I called the temp agency and told them I'd sprained something nasty. An hour later, I was on a train to Copenhagen.  When I got to the store, the manager wasn't in, and a trickle of nervous sweat broke out on the back of my neck. I managed to suppress it and decided to wait for him to return. Once he did, I was led down into the basement of the store, which apparently doubled as the main store room for not only this particular store, but all the stores on the island.  In the corner, a corpulent man sat at his computer while two dogs, two young kids and who I assume was his wife hovered around him. After ignoring me for the better part of 10 minutes, he asked me what he could help me with, and I replied that I was looking for a job.  He made some potshot inquiries to my person, then proceeded to ignore me some more. It wasn't intentional, though &mdash; he just seemed to have an awful lot to do. Not work-related, mind you &mdash; but playing with his kids, showing them album catalogs, and furnishing his wife with promo CDs seemed to be taking up the better part of his day.  After a while, he suggested we retired to his office for a smoke break to discuss details.  Along tagged another employee, who apparently also needed a smoke.  His "office" turned out to be a cramped little room with dimmed, blinking Christmas lights in the ceiling, a bench, an ashtray, a picture of some Indian figure, and a framed picture of Bob Marley sucking on a huge roach. The smoke turned out to be a sizeable joint, which he proceeded to light up and pass around.  The interview itself didn't so much concern me as it concerned entertaining, if completely unrelated, stories about how and why the room had been constructed and what the premises had been used for in the past. In the half hour we spent in the room, we only got as far as deciding that, since I didn't have a driver's license, I should probably be working in-store, not driving from store to store with wares, which seemed a tad obvious to me.  Once the joint had been smoked, we exited the room and he proceeded to ignore me some more. Then, he picked up the phone, dialed my local store, and told them I was coming in Monday at 10am. After hanging up, he looked up at me and said, "Heard that?" I nodded. He then dived headfirst into another longwinded monologue about the things he'd noticed hadn't been taken care of when he last inspected the store, then handed me a card with these things written in neat bullet-list form, saying, "This will be what you'll be taking care of on Monday."  All this time, I'd been sitting on a desk, leaning against a shelf full of CDs. A voice next to me said, "Does this mean you're an employee now?"  I nodded.  "Good, then I can tell you to get out of my way. Please get out of my way."  In my marijuana-induced semi-stupor, I hadn't noticed he'd been stacking CDs onto the shelf while I'd been sitting there.  After shaking on it, I left the store, somewhat floating on air (and not only because of the elation).  I'm going to  enjoy  phoning up that temp agency, telling them to go fuck themselves.

      Have you noticed I haven't switched to Movable Type yet?  I actually installed the thing, got my database login, and got the thing running.  But I'm easily confused, and since this thing's a secret anyway, there seems little point in making it presentable.  So, to reiterate, I forfeit. Blogger wins. Blow your horns.

      I thought it was supposed to be good news when the temp agency phoned me at 9am yesterday morning, telling me to report to somewhere at 2pm, because they'd finally scrounged up a job for me. Little did I know what anguish and stressful suffering I was in for.  I've now been there twice (once yesterday, one today), and I've already come up with at least a million great things I want to say when I tell these people I quit. Such as "you can take this job and shove it", "this is the worst job I've ever had", or &mdash; my personal favorite &mdash; "oh, by the way, this job sucks - would you fire me, please?".  Actually, to be honest, there were a lot of them far more creative than that, and I gleefully anticipated every response I might get, expecting my smile to rise in tempo with their ire.  But, I'm getting ahead of myself. See, it's basically an assembly line gig for a big supermarket chain. I'm working at the main warehouse for this chain, where all the groceries and shit gets distributed to all the individual stores around, oh I dunno, this island, I suppose. Might even be the whole country, but I doubt it.  Anyway, here's my job:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Shit comes down a chute &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I pick shit up and place it neatly on a platform &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Once said platform is full, I launch it &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Platform returns empty &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Repeat  Sounds easy, right? Well, it is. If you don't count the facts that the hours are lousy, the stress is insurmountable, the shit comes in all different sizes and shapes that just never, no matter how hard you try, will fit onto this fucking platform, and on top of everything, they tell us that this is just a training period and they'll knock up the machine to double speed next.  After two days, every limb of mine is sore from crawling up these goddamn chutes to release some shit that's gotten stuck, and after eight hours of trying to squeeze various oddly-sized cardboard boxes full of cat food and marmelade onto one all-too-small platform after another, I simply cannot wait to tell management &mdash; and the temp agency &mdash; where they can stick this fucking job.  A couple of my coworkers were talking about how they've figured out why they're hiring temp workers for this gig instead of simply just hiring people, and the answer is of course that the work is so hideously tedious and stressful that ordinary employees would simply leave too quickly. The logic, apparently, being that temp workers are more desperate for the cash and can't afford to leave so soon &mdash; and, sadly, they're right.  Did I mention that this job starts at 3pm and ends at 11pm? And we only get a half an hour break? And that, while you watch those two last hours tick away, you'd dearly wish someone would come up to you and tell you you're fired, just so you could go home early?  But my salvation awaits.  I went to the local record store today, and it just so happens there seems to be a fairly large number of openings there.  Tomorrow, I'm giving them a ring and see if anything positive turns out from this.  If not, then maybe, if you live in the area, you might read about a guy who went nuts and tried to stab himself with a tin of tuna.

      Oh, I just remembered. I  urlLink previously mentioned  something about listening to  urlLink Morrissey  for a secret reason.  Just for completeness sake, the "secret reason" was that a friend of mine had agreed to go to the Morrissey gig at Roskilde, stand in the crowd with a bottle of wine wearing our Sunday best, and acting as arrogant and cockey as possible. All while loving the music and singing along, of course.  It was a beautiful plan, and it would've been a beautiful moment, but drunkenness and the fact that my girlfriend's lovely sort of ruined it. I don't think there are any hard feelings (I'm sure his fun wasn't spoiled), so I don't really regret standing him up. I had tons of fun, and so did he.  I guess the reason for keeping it a "secret" was that I planned to regale myself with the amusing anecdote of us pissing off everybody in the audience with our high-brow arrogance. But that'll have to wait, I guess.  Oh well. The sex was fantastic.

      I've been reading a book my kidbrother, for some explicable reason, says he got free with a Warhammer 4000 catalogue (yeah, right), entitled "117 Ways to Turn On Your Woman" (translated title, of course).  I can only wonder if the author &mdash; a woman, in case you were wondering &mdash; wrote this book with one hand, because she frequently leaps headfirst into detailed descriptions of not only the technique involved, but also what reaction you should expect, coupled with some very frequent staccato-like deliveries separated with commas, such as "you rub her pussy, she moans, she begs for more, you can hear her breath quickening". I get the feeling she wasn't writing this book purely for her audience's benefit, 'sall I'm sayin'.  But even more importantly, I dearly wish my girlfriend's sister wasn't spending the evening with us. I don't want to leap into the old "the book didn't teach me anything new"-tirade, but Orwell's philosophy that the best books tell you things you already know is definitely true. And, regardless of whether I learned anything, it definitely made me want to exercise them in practice. Oh, the sweet agony.

      I suppose, in some way, I should commemorate the fact that Arnt cooked up another  urlLink Kapitalen Klash  song today ("Spleen"), despite the fact that this is a secret blog and I haven't told anyone the URL.  (That does make me wonder why I keep comments enabled, though. I suppose I just like the aesthetics of the opportunity.)  Anyway, he has. And it rocks.

      Pardon the theatricals; I just felt like saying it. Of course there are many other great anchors of my sanity in the world than my synthesizer.  But I hear all this great music in my head. At least, what I  think  is great music. Actually, let me re-emphasize that: what  I  think is great music. But whenever I do, for some reason, I'm always miles away from my synthesizer, where I can comfortably record it, lest it fall prey to my abhorrently bad memory and be forever lost in the haze of great ideas that could've been, but never were.  For instance, right now I have this great idea for a 12/8 up-tempo march-like rhythm with a staccato guitar chord on every first beat, which would sound right at home with those lame-ass garage bands that radio stations frequently mistake for rock'n'roll. Then, once the build-up to the chorus is done, let it simmer for a while in some freeform ambient thing for only one bar, and then explode in the most fiery distorted mess you've ever heard, with cymbals a plenty, thrashy no-chord guitar frenzy, and &mdash; by all means &mdash; throaty screaming. And then, once that's done, go straight back into the radio-friendly 12/8 up-tempo thing again.  See, descriptions fall appallingly short. It sounds horrible on paper. But it sounds brilliant in my head. I wish I had my synthesizer so I could show you all.  I have a feeling everybody has this symptom. Some are even less fortunate than I, in the sense that they can't even bring the music in their head into something tangible they can show others. Man, that makes my heart ache, thinking of all that brilliant music going to waste.

       urlLink Stranger than Paradise  was the name, and the mud rose high during the raging rain showers and coursing winds that, occasionally, allowed extended pockets of calm, sunfilled moments to filter through. Although the rain and wind were determined to cause damage of biblical proportions, our camp held up, thanks to the valiant efforts of our camp leader, who constructed a veritable Titanic of a fortress for us to remain warm, snug, and &mdash; above all &mdash; dry throughout the festival.  Too many good memories to recount in detail, but here's a few good ones:  - One of my friends got blisteringly drunk, staggered to the stage of a poetry slamming competition in the Spoken Word tent, signed in under a pseudonym he'd made up on the spot, and proceeded to jackhammer his way through an improvised headscratcher of a monologue, which centered around an offer to strip naked with the assurance that he was really going to do it, with an impressively straight face. The contents of this monologue, which lasted all of 45 seconds, got him boo'ed off stage, receiving the lowest possible grade imaginable. Consequently, the monologue &mdash; which also included a "magic" act that involved him throwing a coin in the air and then catching it, throwing his arms out grandiously upon succeeding &mdash; became the source of staple catchphrases in our camp for the remainder of the festival.  - Our most punked-out camp member, whose idea of a psychedelic experience last year was ingesting four times the recommended dosage of stomach relief pills, started each morning with a shot of 70% proof illegally imported Absinthe, then vigorously insisted that everybody else who got out of their tents do the same. I'm pretty sure he wasn't the only one who brought Absinthe, though, because an alarming amount was being gleefully passed around during the first two days (which remain a fuzzy haze in my memory), and there was still some left on the penultimate day.  - David Bowie cancelled and was replaced by &mdash; hang on to this one &mdash; Slipknot. Yes, the metal band. Talk about a genre switch.  Plus, they had to be specially flown in to perform at 7pm for the festival, then immediately get on a plane to perform in Germany at 2am.  - Another of my friends, who usually has a reserved, shy demeanor about him, took a tumble in the ankle-high mud pools that had formed all over the festival grounds as a result of near-constant rain showers. Blisteringly drunk, of course, as well as ridiculously stoned, he attempted to offer himself up as a huggy bear for any Norwegian girls passing by. It wasn't until my girlfriend, also absurdly inebriated at this point, started pimping him out to various passer-by's, camera in hand, that things really took off. Eventually the rain forced us inside, but the mud hugging party will forever remain a special event.  - A similar event took place the night before, when the mud was barely forming and the terrain was still easy to traverse. Two friends of mine &mdash; one was tripping on shrooms for the first time and having the time of his life, and I'm quite sure so was the other one &mdash; started handing out hugs to everyone who walked by, claiming it was in the spirit of the festival. The punch line here, if one can call it that, is that, in sobriety, everyone of us are reserved, sarcastic, bitter husks of people, of varying degrees &mdash; the punch line being that the hugs were handed out with genuine love; no tongue-in-cheek. A special, rare humanitarian moment.  - Then there was the beer situation. Everyone had basically put down an order to two of my close friends, who then went to Germany two days before the festival began, and made the purchase (beer being significantly cheaper when you cross the border). Of course, this meant smuggling way more beer than allowed across the border, but despite being held up at customs check, they somehow managed to employ the Jedi Mind Trick and were allowed to continue. Approximately 100 cases of beer (24 cans for each case, most of them Gold beer) were brought to camp. Everything fucked up, all the cases arrived at the camp simultaneously, and out of fear of thievery (having that much beer at a festival in plain sight is like putting up a neon sign outside your camp, saying "We're Ignorant Dolts - Beer Is On Us!"), we stashed them all in the tents with no consideration for who ordered who. After a shortlived drunken debate, everyone just sort of agreed that all cases were deemed Public Domain, and the rest of the festival ran surprisingly smoothly under these conditions. Who would've thought the spirit of solidarity could be sparked out of the drunken paranoia of not having a morning beer when you woke up?  - A tape recorder, three drunk people, and an empty side of a tape. What to do? I know! Let's go around the festival grounds (which, on our side, was primarily occupied by foreigners from other Scandinavian countries) and enquire about their sexual orientation. And let's have the drunkest of us three kneel down in the center, promising the interviewee that, should the questions cross his/her threshold, he/she was encouraged to administer punishment to our kneeling companion. Everything went great until we stumbled across a young girl who proudly exclamated that she liked being fucked in every bodily orifice you can squeeze an erect penis into. We kinda felt that couldn't be topped, so thus ended the game. We named the tape  Boogie-Lise's Videodagbog , which is only funny for Danes so I won't bother explaining. It was originally supposed to be a festival diary, but every night we'd get drunk and forget all about it, so it only ended up containing the initial entry, and then half an hour of nonsense about Swedish bisexuality. I, for one, hope I never hear this tape sober.  - My girlfriend, the sweetest thing, got absolutely drunk after a show involving hip hop and Muppets, and started jumping around in the mud like a little 10-year old girl, and taking pictures of everything that awed her. I've never seen anything cuter.  - And, of course, being able to go to sleep with my girlfriend every night made it all so much better.  There are tons of other stories, of course, but these are all I can think off of the top of my head. The rest will have to come later.  For now, I'm home with my folks, having all the mud washed out of my clothes. It's back to the real life, which I dread enormously. First thing tomorrow: I make good friends with the social institution that will, hopefully, be paying next months rent. Wish me luck.

      Friday: Reunion with the old IRC gang. Saturday:  urlLink Psyke Project  gig; almost everyone from work will be there, plus my bandmates. The 27th: Band rehearsals, with our old guitarist rejoining the group.  And then, the 4th of next month ... very secret. ;)  Btw,  urlLink my best KK-track so far . We've been remixed. I won't be outdone.  P. (from work) and I were also talking about making a band with two bass players, a drum(machine), and lots of analogue synths. Could be fun. We'll see if it takes off.

      Well, actually, it wasn't even the weekend. It was a weekday — Thursday, actually — that W., D., and B.T. talked me into joining them for an after-work drink session. Actually, they'd been at it most of the day, and my girlfriend and I joined them right after I got off from work. Three bottles of vodka were consumed. At one point, B.T. and I decided we needed to take some time out from sitting outside and socialising, and we needed to go back to his place (a minute from where we were sitting) and listen to some Offspring. We even snuck the last bottle with us. It wasn't long after that that I decided to head home, unexpectedly hold two prolonged upchuck-sessiosn before bedtime, get some sleep, and get up and go to work. Thankfully, my boss said the day before it was okay to show up an hour later than usual. Not that they seem to mind that much, but anyway.  This weekend was my dad's birthday, so it was back to the nest for a bit of wine, some sunny barbecue, and ... well, just good family time, really. We didn't really do much except sit in the sun and talk and drink red wine, but it was great, and I got a bag of chillies that my brother brought home as a souvenir from his trip.  The following day, L. came round with his laptop and we played  Rollcage  until four in the morning, whilst I drank more red wine, finishing on some vodka. Hey, you finish what you start. I haven't forgotten promising D. that I wouldn't drink unless it was at a social event, but it  was  a social event — actually, two of them — so I'm covered. ;)  We also wrote a  urlLink very non-sensical short story , taking turns every time one of us got stuck. We're not sure why. But we had fun.  The next day, we sat around watching DVDs &mdash; the most interesting of which, at least to me, was  urlLink Barefoot Gen , an anime that certainly pulled no punches showing the horrors of a nuclear explosion in all its gritty detail, seen through the eyes of a way-too-young boy. Eyes popping out of peoples heads and walking semi-dead wasn't exactly what I was hoping to see whilst nursing a mild hangover, but it sure left an impression. I like it when something can surprise and intrigue me like that.  The past two days: work. Nothing new. No controlled substance intake as of yet (except alcohol, and only a very small amount yesterday), but that probably won't last.
