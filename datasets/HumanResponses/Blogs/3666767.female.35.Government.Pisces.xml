      I hate cell phones!  I have a cell phone, but I still don't like them.  They give a false sense of self-importance.  Cell phones have made us be rude everywhere from church to bus stops.  They make people feel compelled to call about the smallest, insignificant things.  Consider them homing devices because they allow you to be tracked down anytime and anywhere.  However, the caller i.d. function allows you to decide the fate of your caller.  You can choose to "answer" or "reject" the caller sending them straight to voice mail.  Don't get me wrong, cell phones have their merits. As I see it, we lived without before and I think that we could do it again.  I know that the pay phones would probably appreciate the death of the cell phone.

      I have Tivo and I love it!  If you love TV as much as I do, you need a Tivo.  It makes life so much simpler.  You can go on with your life and never miss a show.

      What am I doing here?  I read about blogs and thought that I would give it a spin.  And away we go...

      I know that I haven't written anything in a while, but I'm back.&nbsp; Work has been kicking my ass.&nbsp; We had this project that we were working on.&nbsp; It's almost finished and ready to go out of the door.&nbsp; I'm relieved.&nbsp; This past weekend was the first time in weeks that I was able to relax and not worry about having to face this beast on Monday morning.  &nbsp;  In other news, I really tired of hearing the various debates on the news about gay marriage.&nbsp; It's a civil rights issue.&nbsp; I wish that I could marry my lover, but we don't live in a fantasy world.&nbsp; What I would like is to be able for us to&nbsp;have&nbsp;the same equal rights as straight couples.&nbsp; Even after 7 years, straight relationships are recognized as "common law" marriages.&nbsp; I'm a tax payer.&nbsp; In fact, a large portion of my check goes to taxes every two weeks.&nbsp; I just want to&nbsp;be treated fairly and equally, just like my straight counterparts.&nbsp; It would be such a relief if my&nbsp;family could be covered&nbsp;by my health benefits.&nbsp;

      Here's a new twist, I'm broadcasting live right from the privacy of my own home.  Normally, when I'm making a entry into my blog, I'm doing it from work.  They have a much faster internet connection, plus it's very convenient.  I know that is probably very unethical, but you show me anyone who doesn't take advantage of the Internet at work and I'll show you someone who really doesn't have a clue.  I wasn't planning on being in the house doing laundry today, but that is where I am.  I'm online because my lover is sleeping through a hangover.  She came in close to 6:00 AM.  I was irritated because she is supposed to call me if she is going to be later than 3:30 AM.  That is our agreement.  We're supposed to go to the beach tomorrow.  I'm looking forward to it, but I am not looking forward to the holiday crowds.
