      Well... today was kinda weird. i had to spend like 4 hours with my grandparents which is always kinda awkward cuz my grandad has hearing problems and his wife isn't my real grandma cuz she dies. so its really awkward for me, but thats just life i guess. I'm thinking about going up to see a movie with danielle, devon, and connor. we might just walk around the mall though, i'm still not sure. I GOT GROUNDED FROM THE COMPUTER! i was "onine too long" according to my mom, so if i randomly sign off, its probably cuz my parents just got home or something. Hmmm, what else is there to talk about??? Well, i found some more cd's that i really want: 1. Modest Mouse 2. Lit  O yea, the edge is giving away tickets all this week for edgefest and i keep trying to call in and win some. But i've never really been good at winning stuff, so i doubt i'll get anything. My parents are making me play my clarniet like every day all of a sudden. Its just cuz they want me to make a good impression on my new private lessons teacher. WEll, i've got nothing else to say so later Ryan  ps- I'm trying to fix my digital camera so i can get a freaking picture on my site somewhere, but its not working all of a sudden... idk why you would care cuz if you are reading this then you already know me... well thanks for making me feel stupid! bye

      Wow... its been way too long. Well for those of you know dont already know, i was grounded from the comp for about 2 weeks and i just got ungrounded today. I am still grounded from doing anything with friends till tuesday. I helped out at the band hall for the whole last week and we did folders and keys and stand tunes for every instrument... and so on. so thats what i've been doing. oyea...  DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL IS THE BEST BAND EVER!!!!  (sorry, i'm just hooked rite now)  So i went to go see White Chicks (SUCKED) and i feel asleep durring it. So the next thing i know i am dreaming that i am watching the same movie, but instead of with my family i am watching it with some friends. And i start talking to one of my friends about how stupid the movie is and she is like "yea, this is a waste of money". The next thing i know she leans over and kisses me. so i kiss her back and we just kiss for a few seconds and then the next thing i know we are like making out major! and this goes on for like 10 min or so. Then the movie is over and she looks at me and she's like "i changed my mind... they undercharged for that" and then she gives me a good-bye kiss and drives home.  Yea, it was crazy, maybe it'll happen some day who knows. Well i have a big list of cd's i want now because i found some good christain stuff i want... 1. Dashboard Confessional- Swiss Army Romance 2. Spiderman 2 soundtrack 3. The new Lit cd 4. The Matthew West cd 5. The new Pillar cd 6. The new OC Supertones cd 7. The new Sanctus Real cd 8. much much more...  I NEED MONEY!!!! I'm only like $31 more until i am out of debt and then i can go get whatever i want.  Well Danielle is leaving to go on vacation on monday and then leaving at the end of the month for a soccer tournament in New York so idk what i'm gonna do with friends. If you wanna do anything then call me (after tuesday, cuz i'm grounded still). I will talk to you all later... good night

         Well....      there is so much do say that i have no idea where to get started. I guess i can start off by saying that the John Mayer/ Maroon 5 concert was AMAZING. I can honestly say that i have never been to anything like that before and i am sooooo looking forward to next year. His passion when he is playing is unbelieveable and really obvious when you see him live. He was also on the front of "Guitar Players" Magazine and they said that he was gonna be the next Hendrix or Clapton! He did a Clapton song that just blew me away because i didn't know he was that good at guitar. well this was the playlist in order that he did...      Bigger Than My Body      Why Georgia      New Deep      3x5      Blues in C      Come Back To Bed      My Stupid Mouth      Something's Missing      Old Love&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Eric Clapton)      Your Body is a Wonderland      No Such Thing      Clarity      ENCORE      Home Life (solo)      Comfortable (solo)      83 (full on)        &nbsp;    Yea, its probably the best 50 dollars that i have ever spent... EVER. On john mayer's jounal site he said "This may very well have been the best crowd of the summer thus far - you guys came to have yourselves a good little Friday night. &nbsp;The Blues jam killed, everyone was on fire up in here, tear the roof off. &nbsp;I was taking pictures in Old Love and caught myself laughing it was so good. &nbsp;So good. &nbsp;Thanks to everyone for making it a standout night." ROCK ON!        &nbsp;    Other than that there hasn't been a whole lot going on. Leadership camp was pretty borring, but i actually did learn more than i expected that i would. I am NOT looking forward to full band camp because 2-a-days suck and it leaves no time for friends, only rest and food.        &nbsp;    I went to youth group and connor was in Holland so i didn't have anybody to hang out with except for my sis and her crazy cool friends (melanie and kelsey). And who did i see there that was visiting that i talked to about church not more than 4 days before????? The totally awesome Lisa Manson and she waved, so naturaly i waved. I also got to see my old best friend... the awesome... the newly declared "#1 fish"... Blake Mankin!!!!!! and we talked and decided that we had to meet for coffee eventually and catch up so i could give him the "Ryan Crombar, Hish School 101 talk". That kid is crazy cool.        &nbsp;    I went to the mall today so i could catch up with connor and so that he could tell me all about Holland, which was cool. But danielle and devond couldn't go up there, so it looked kinda weird with 2 guys walking around the mall together... o well, it was fun anyway. I re-visited the jacket that i realllly want from American Eagle and i also went to Virgin and looked at a few CD's        &nbsp;    WEll, in closing, hopefully i will be able to have a fantastic talk with the o-so-great&nbsp;Jaclyn tomorrow. OH YEA! the clarinet camp concert is tomorrow, which i am attending, and i get to sit with Olivia and her mom! (If you dont know Olivia... well then you're just missin out, cuz shes awesome). Well, i am gonna go because i am sick of typing and i am on AIM also. so, i guess i will talk to you later        &nbsp;    I'M GETTING A PHONE AND IT IS SO TITE (flip, camera, front screen, web, etc) O YEA!!!!!! (Samsung a670, check it out)        &nbsp;    Later!
