      Someone should do us all a favour and  shoot  these  urlLink clowns  from Sweden.  Changing your bad suits, boys, will not change the fact that your music and theatrics are ridiculous.  Do you have the time, to listen to me whine?

      Even Republica's Saffron knows ISDN sucks.  Not bad for pop band.  Then you do the search for the links and you'll find  nothing but shit  regarding  Republica  and  ISDN .  The latter I have no problem with, but the former?

        Look at my friends they're always laughing Think they're doing alright Maybe it's me they think they're fooling It's a general insight Who knows what you see Maybe it's lies, all lies  She gave me a kiss like judas Crowning the clown on his merry-go-round She gave me a kiss like Judas Who wears the crown when your head's on the ground  So glad you could make it Beast and Beauty way up high Cold pains of Sanctuary It helps to make up my disguise But water, she gave me water, so I gave her the use of my life Is it the chip on my shoulder Or the hunch on my back that's as sharp as a knife?

      And I quote:   The following  urlLink HTML  elements specify font information. Although they are not all deprecated, their use is discouraged in favor of style sheets.   Really?  Could you make it more complex?   urlLink troff , albeit arcane, was used first to write Patents.  In  urlLink troff  to get a 12pt font all I need is:   .pt 12 .vs 14   And  no  fuckin'  style sheets .

      On today's  food run  I found three pieces of physical mail threatening hanging, drawing and quartering if I didn't pay various  large financial institutions  various sums of money.  Well, it ain't gonna work.  I know a bit about this  debt collection  nonsense and French Law.  I even used to have conversations with someone who did this for a job and worked in a shared office where the  debt chasers  worked.  I find the  bold font  in  UPPER CASE  in their letters ever so  scary .  One  debt chaser  was so clever to call me at 0433 [local] thinking I'd be awake, asking me to call him back.  Sorry?  If I haven't paid you it's because I can't.  Do you think it's good economics for me to waste more money, on international phone calls, so I can listen to a lot of  shit  while making my financial state  worse .  If that maniac Branson can afford to build some Bond style car to  drive  across the channel, well he can bung me a few quid.  If they really want the money they can email  urlLink Laura Creighton .

      Yesterday, I headed off to an interview with a mob who specialise in helping out unemployable types, like myself.  It was looking not so great 'cos I know my industry [computers] pretty well and have worked in it for some 22 years, in various countries, in various languages [human and programming].  So, I was less than pleased about going, but  Article 311-3-4 du Code du Travail  (of which I have a copy) is a fairly compelling reason.  On the up-side I only had to take M&eacute;tro line 4 to Ch&acirc;teau d'Eau, which is 5 minutes away, but on the down-side I was going to enter  le 10&egrave; .  I fuckin' hate  le 10&egrave; .  As I egressed the M&eacute;tro, by escalator, I see 8-10 black guys, of southern African descent, yelling in some language which was not French or any other language I could recognise.  I was somewhat perplexed.  Being seen to be an American can stir up all sorts of shit and I dress like one, although I did have my  urlLink ENIGMA  baseball cap on.  Me, being first on the the escalator wondered whether it was directed at me, so I just resorted to the  ignore them and show no fear  policy.  So, nothing happened.  I then crossed the road and saw the  same fucking scene .  The interview wasn't a waste of time, but next time I'm getting off at Cadet.

      This clown ran as an MEP.  I have a few words of advice:    Stick to what you know.   Go back to that 'orrible chat show that you used to do, in the morning, on the  urlLink BBC .   Don't preach about things you know  nothing  about (ie. the EU).   Hypocrisy doesn't work; running as an MEP to shut the EU down?   Shut the fuck up!

      I can't vote in the EU elections 'cos I'm not a citizen and I can't vote  little Johnny  out in the Oz elections because non-residents can't vote.  WTF?  Not even embassy officials can vote and it's the bloody  LAW  that Australians  must  vote.  I think it's a good  LAW , although I'm not real keen on  LAW s.

      Bad news:   I owe a  large financial institution  a  reasonably large  sum of money.   Good news:   I understand the relevant laws and confirmed that I did.  The reply stated:   I advise that it is uncommon for an [deleted] creditor to commence debt recovery action against a debtor who resides overseas.

      There will be no  fuckups ,  not on my watch .  Today I was told that a job I was interviewed for on Monday had already been taken or I didn't look like a good candidate.  The original interview was set up for the previous Thursday, but no-one turned up.  Perhaps those few days made the difference?

      Yesterday, I saw  urlLink Yes   urlLink  au Zenith   and they were   truly amazing  .  They played 2 sets and one encore (some 3 hours worth).  The lineup was Anderson/Howe/Squire/Wakeman/White.  It was good to see Rick play again.  Alan had this   enormous   drumkit (except for the acoustic stuff) and played it magnificently which reminded me of a story Cozy Powell told of a steel drumkit which weighed one [imperial] ton, when he was touring with ELP.  Chris had the usual  thundering bass  with almost  infinite sustain .  Those  nu-metal  boys coulda learnt a lot by watching these guys.  Jon, Steve and Rick?  What can I say?  Perfect.  The 1st set was 1 hour 15 minutes, consisting of:    Going For The One   Sweet Dreams   All Good People    unknown  [reminiscent of White Rabbit]   South Side Of The Sky   All These Many Years Ago   Glory Of The World [new one?]   Your's Is No Disgrace     The 2nd set was 1 hour 25 minutes, consisting of:    The Meeting   Long Distance Runaround   Time Is Time [played as a  homage to the fans ]   Roundabout [Chicago shuffle style]    unknown    Owner Of a Lonely Heart   Steve Howe acoustic solo   Rhythm Of Love   Ritual      The first 5 were acoustic.  It was interesting to observe that Steve did  not  play any of those  horrible  Rabin solos.  Some of Rabin's demos are interesting, but the  bad guitar god  syndrome does not impress Steve, Chris nor I.  When I saw them first, in New York in 1984, I remember Chris walking across the stage and crashing into Rabin just as he was to kick into another  appalling  solo -- it worked [no solo].  Encore:    Starship Trooper     I'll see if I can fill in the unknowns later.  I also have a new  urlLink Yes  baseball cap to replace the one I lost in Sweden:

      So I got some more today.  These boys would seem to be halfway  serious  about it, so I think I'll negociate with 'em.  They like that 'cos they understand the financial realities; if it goes to Court it gets expensive and you might not win.   urlLink The Justice Game , by Geoffrey Robertson QC, is an excellent read.  Then again, I  could  push their resolve.  The  worst case scenario  is this:       Un Hussier de Justice  is sent to confiscate my material possessions, after various legal shenanigans   They find my safe   It needs a key   It also needs a 5 digit code   One of its contents is only allowed to be in my possession   It would make for a fine argument and a certain amount of confusion

      I have just seen on  urlLink Shooting Stars , with  urlLink Ulrika-ka-ka , and George Dawes has just sung the theme to  urlLink Happy Days  in French.  Now, that was bad, but have you  ever  seen it dubbed into French?  This can not be a good sign, although it was better than this French prat wearing a  urlLink Bay City Rollers  t-shirt at my favourite bar.  Some of it was too ugly to contemplate.

Of course, it breaks all the French  Class 1  firearms ownership laws.  An interesting idea, which would  raise some pulses .  But, ultimately stupid.

        The Great Man ... is colder, harder, less hesitating, and without respect and without the fear of "opinion"; he lacks the virtues that accompany respect and "respectability", and altogether everything that is the "virtue of the herd".  If he cannot lead, he goes alone. ... He knows he is incommunicable: he finds it tasteless to be familiar. ... When not speaking to himself, he wears a mask. There is a solitude within him that is inaccessible to praise or blame.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Friedrich Nietzche, The Will to Power

      So I saw  urlLink it  today, thanks to the people who had the guts to back its release, unlike the sissies who refused to release it.  I more or less knew what it was going to see, but it was a  shocker ; it was worse than I expected.  The (mostly French) audience applauded at the end of it.  It ends with Neil Young's  urlLink Keep On Rockin' In The Free World .  Freedom?  In the USA?  What a concept.

      The chances of seeing a general practitioner are near zero or involve waiting several months.  At the  Akuten , if you're in a hurry, complain of chest pain.  At the Hospital's casualty [ER] department storm around screaming, in your native language, that you demand to be seen  raht-now , using as much medical terminology as you know [ pulse-ox  is a good term].  This approach avoids a 6 hour wait in an empty department for 3 stitches and has been demonstrated to get a 1 hour service in a packed department for 1 stitch [suture].  On last count, my head has 23 stitches (17 in one hit/fall).  Make sure you have a private health fund before going to the Dentist.  I'll stick to the French  urlLink Sécu ,  tack .

      It would seem that there is one somewhat further north than California.  It's called Sweden.  After filing a  j&auml;mknig  which informs the tax authorities that this is my final return and will not be earning more any income in the country.  This, apparently, was lost as I am still out some 5000 SEK [~500 &euro] which they owe me and should have be restituted  last  November.  This then forced me to then re-declare my 2003 income, which I was less than happy about, but it's not hard to do.  Unfortunately, this seems to have snowballed into a flurry of forms, sent to my Paris address, in Swedish, asking my status and intentions and those of my dependents [zero].  The last one was from the  urlLink tax department  which I filled out, as best as I could, and wrote in English that I had no intention of  ever  returning to Sweden.  But it was not to stop there.  Now, I have to tell their horrendous  urlLink health care system  more or less the same information.  The only up side on this is that I have to make the declaration:   p&aring; heder och samvete   which is the stupid title they give  urlLink JAG  in Sweden.   You can check out any time you like.

        In view of the ongoing risk of terrorist attacks, Australians in France are advised to be alert to their own security and keep themselves informed of developments that might affect their safety. The French Government's domestic terror alert level is at red (the second highest level in a four grade scale).   And it shows.  They're doing a good job, unlike certain countries I could mention.

I've  wasted enough time  been paid to work on a project that was a precursor of  urlLink WAP , then laughed at and cursed things such as  urlLink GPRS  and  urlLink 3G  mobile data.  Fuck that noise, Jack.  Right now, I'm eating pistachios, drinking red [Bordeaux] and listening to various stuff on one of my laptops.  There's no CD involved as I've cut various CDs I own down as 160Kbit/s  urlLink MP3 s and they  break up , very much like any mobile call you might have had.  Even if it's in simple 4/4 time a missed beat makes me  reach for my  revolver  9mm automatic.   Now, this pisses me off.  I have more compute power and bandwidth than necessary and it still doesn't work; this is just bad design.  The hardware should be ready to buffer enough so it doesn't  break up  and the software should buffer so it  always  has enough data to deliver to the hardware, but no.  We are now so conditioned to broken junk that we don't see it as a problem.

      Perhaps I should start with the new  urlLink Richard Clapton   urlLink album  -- Richard at his best (thanks to V).  Or that I got some tips from  un Moniteur  so I shot  urlLink better  today.  Or bitch that I also shot  badly .  Or just  shut the fuck up .

      Abstinence, huh?  Is that a solution?  I can can think of one case:  If  big george  had abstained there would be no  little george .  However, if you have enough money in  CONUS  you can get any chimp into power as President, who'll  bomb the piss  out of anyone who takes their whim.

      The last two times I've been down to my fave bar I've been asked:   Where've you been?   And, to complicate things further, both times, people have been trying to hook me up with people who might find me a job.  Very strange.

      So the French were sick of all these layoffs, Companies crashing and burning and the  very real  prospect of winding up on the streets.  So, they  manifest&eacute;, manifest&eacute;  and  manifest&eacute; .  Finally they used the LAW.  As a result, my twindling dole runs on for an  extra seven months .

       Sitting down for another night's dubious cable TV on  urlLink BBC Prime  I get hit by a triple whammy:    urlLink Anne Robinson   Ruby Wax   urlLink Linda Green    At least  urlLink ''Mad'' Frankie Fraser  was on  urlLink Shooting Stars .&nbsp; He's the real thing.&nbsp; The others are just jokes.

        Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.   So then I get told that this Amendment only applies to laws made by Congress.  Err, I think the U.S. courts  would  should uphold this right in  any  circumstance.  Jeez ...

      So I wake up and 10 minutes later I get a call about  la lettre de motivation  I had written and have a 10 minute conversation on how to fix it.  I had  assumed  that, given I had emailed it, I would get a corrected version sent bank.  So, in some semi comatose state, I noted, in some bizarre shorthand, the hacks I have to make to it.  Perhaps there is some method behind this.

      Funny how you have to write a physical letter to  Wealth Management Operations  to close your account with some $AUD 18 in it.  Not sure that $AUD 18 is actually  wealth .   urlLink Oxymoron(s) !  Oh yeah, the  urlLink Shittybank  (sic) are involved in this Iraq  police action .  But, don't let that worry you ...

        When I look at the human race all over the world I think there's zero reason for humanity to survive.&nbsp; We're destructive, uncaring, thoughtless, greedy, power hungry.&nbsp; But when I look at a few individuals, there seems every reason for humanity to survive. He [John Nash] was worth doing the very best for.

       Today's&nbsp;gem was that&nbsp;I finally contacted this Headhunter [jobs not scalps] who runs their local  Human Resources  department.&nbsp; They are a multinational company and their Paris office is located in ... wait for it ...  trou de cul, Île de France.&nbsp;  Just based on the postcode I could tell something was wrong.&nbsp; Hell, I needed my  urlLink GPS  to find it.&nbsp;   Any 78000 postcode means it's a bugger to get there and often near impossible to get back from.   urlLink GPS , physical maps and  la   urlLink SNCF &nbsp;web based trip guides all confirmed that it was at least a 2 klick walk across  open  terrain from the nearest rail station.  You could try getting a cab, but ~30 klicks south west of Paris  nothing  is guaranteed.  Looking at the roads, the cab fares, if possible, would be expensive.  So, I replied outlining these various impediments, asking if there was another way to do this and added various bits of  urlLink code &nbsp;as an incentive.   An immediate reply followed.&nbsp; It was  non .  What?&nbsp; You can't afford to reimburse me for the cab fares?&nbsp; You can't afford to send someone to pick me up?&nbsp; What's this  shit , man?  What we have here is a buncha cheap, ignorant slimeballs.&nbsp; So,&nbsp; I've saved myself a wasted trip.

        The economy is buggered.  France and Germany have been pulled into line over their failure to adhere to the parameters of the European Monetary Union.  The prices are outrageous.  Should you lose your job you are in a  precarious  position.  Once in a  precarious  position the Banks will beat you to death.  The job market is non-existent.  Maybe they even understand  urlLink Zweite Neon .  People who don't live it (or haven't) have no idea.  I'm not French, I wasn't born in Paris but I think it's the best place  for me  to live; as an ex-pat I've learnt the system, the survival skills, seen the woe and know how to get out of most of it.  &nbsp;  If  urlLink I had any money  and could build a client base I'd build a business based on getting people out of or helping them out of their adminstrative woe.&nbsp;&nbsp; Administration is a complex thing in France.  &nbsp;  The ex-pats usually know more about it than the French because any half-way smart ex-pat has had to learn the system from&nbsp;zero and to take their lumps along the way.&nbsp;

        Ne ratez pas une occasion de vous isoler pour réfléchir au calme boyd. On parle de vous et de votre avenir professionnel mais vous ne savez pas très bien en quels termes. Il faut donc vous préparer à répondre en homme que rien n'étonne. Quel que soit votre désir, de la sécurité ou du risque, ne réagissez qu'en toute connaissance de cause. Laissez vos supérieurs ou vos partenaires formuler clairement leurs propositions...

      According to  urlLink Le Monde  the US Military have only one  urlLink M-16  round factory and it can't keep up with demand.  It further states that they've had to buy  urlLink M-16  ammo from their NATO buddies.  Fortunately (iirc) the Brit  urlLink SA-80  fires the same round, so they have some rounds to spare.  This goes back to hardware chip designers:  always have two plants to make your chips so if one has problems you have a fallback.  Reminds me of an old 'nam joke:   Got some  urlLink ARVN  rifles.  Never been fired and only dropped once.

        This is X, is this Y?   Yes, I am.   Are you free to work on job Z now?   Yes.   Well, I have a client who wants someone who can do Z.   Could you be more specific about Z, because Z is complex?   Err, no I don't have the job description from the client.   Well, I can't answer your questions without more detail.   I'll have the job description, tomorrow.&nbsp; Can I call you?   Sure.    What a  fucking waste of time  with an incompetent  fool .

      And no, I don't mean the game.  The  debt spiral  has finally got me in its clutches and the way out is  less than obvious .  I blame the final nail on Laura Creighton  urlLink &lt;lac@strakt.com&gt; .  This deluded individual has cost me more than 30 000 &euro; and threatened to fire me if I asked an organisational question (again) after working for  urlLink AB Strakt  for a month or so.  Following that incident she underwent psychiatric treatment.  I just walked back into my office and wondered  what the fuck am I doing here ?  I probably put  urlLink Van Halen  on and stared into my monitor.  As for the 30 000 &euro; (very much on the low side)?  I asked for it and it was refused.  Lawyers?  I can't afford 'em.  Freedom of Speech?  I have that in two countries and I'm exercising it.  Expect a  sitrep  late next week.

        En ce moment, sur le plan budgétaire, vous avez plutôt tendance à manquer de discernement, boyd . Côté finances, apprenez à dire non aux sollicitations que l'on peut vous faire. Vos projets professionnels ou un achat inopiné pourraient vous poser problème. Vous devez donc, trouver séance tenante, le moyen de faire des économies. En effet, des mises à jour s'imposent sur le plan financier...

      I have tried to  typeset  various documents using various  urlLink &mu;$loth   turds  tools [Wordpad, Word] and each time, without fail, WISINWIFG [What I See Is Not What I Fucking Get]!!  This  will  not do.  And, no, it's not my eyesight.  So, once I have  regained composure  I will rewrite my CVs in  urlLink troff(1) ; a 30 year old piece of software that always gets it right.

      Given this  urlLink thing  was created by an  urlLink exception , judged in private by a bunch of exceptional Swedes and presented by The Monarch of Sweden [another exception].  I'd just like them to explain it to me how this sits with  urlLink Jantelagen ?  Just how  noble  is that?
