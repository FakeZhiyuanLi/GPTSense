      maybe i'm really petty... well... i really cant stand it when pple lie to me... most of e times, when they lie... i wont believe them ever again... but... it take time for me to have trust in them... but most of them juz disappoint me... whether it's a harmless joke or not... it all matter to me... maybe i'm juz too serious...
