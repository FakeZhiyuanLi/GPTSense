      When does someone call a long distance relationship quits? Is it true absence makes the heart grow fonder or is it just the biggest load of shit ever? It has been 9 months and I feel emotionally exhausted all due to my LDR (long distance relationship) I am not sure what to do anymore or how to make it work.  In the beginning I felt sick and worried that I had made the biggest mistake of my life, that is leaving my boyfriend while I moved to another country. I guess I really did not realize how much I actually cared for him until I could not touch him, hug him or even kiss him when ever I wanted to. I felt lonely and constantly worried that he would forget me. 9 months have gone by and he has visited me a few times. In between visits there was constant phonecalls and romantic emails. Our first reunion in Feb was great. It was passionate and after watching him get back on the plane I felt even more lonely than I had the very first time I said goodbye. The second visit was in June and it was terrible. We fought and annoyed eachother to no end. That was not the ending result we wanted but for some reason it was just hard to tolerate eachother.  After that last visit in June our relationship has not been the same. There are no more romantic emails and the phone calls seem forced. I am emotionally tired and he says that it is so hard for him to have a relationship over the phone. Is it difficult to take 2 minutes of the day and call someone that you supposedly love so much to say HI? Am I out of line asking for this kind of commitment. My boyfriend has sworn to me that he would never cheat on me but I have such a hard time trusting him. Ok maybe it is more along the lines that I do not trust him. I know I need to but for me it is difficult. Especially when I don't hear from him everyday.  What is expected of a LDR? What is acceptable? Should I need to hear from him? Is it wrong for him not to call? I find myself more and more everyday evaluating my relationship and whether it has the staying power we are so desperately trying to save. I love my boyfriend more than life itself but I feel like I am putting more into this relationship than he is and that I am getting shorted and may be wasting a lot of time. Is that possible. As I sit here and write this blog I think how I have not spoken to him once today and he never called last night after he said he would. But also I am trying to plan a trip for him to come out here and be with me for 2 weeks? Am I stupid for doing this? Should I move on or should I invest more energy and more emotion into this relationship? I am lost and have no answers. Sometimes I am so angry about my situation that it angers me to see other couples enjoying eachothers company so much. What do I need to do to have that? Why is someone making it so hard for us to be together and happy? Should this be telling us something? What the hell am I missing?

      I am sitting at work bored out of my mind......again...I volunteered to do OT this week and this is the special day. I spent a wild time on the town last night, spent the today in the sun and now I feel as though the life has literally been sucked out of me. I barely have energy to type this blog. 1 hour to go...  Long distant relationships suck!  What does one do when out on the town with drunken co-workers and then is grappled by a drunken boss? I am not referring to myself but a friend who had been accosted last night by her boss.  My friend and her boss are good friends and see eachother on a daily basis. They both can drink enough booze to sink a ship and in turn get a little crazy, more her than him. Is that a justifiable excuse though? If this had taken place at work it could be considered sexual harrassment, but since it was at a bar and everyone was drinking is it a different story? My friend was quite appalled and embarrassed and did not enjoy the groping one bit. Did she say anyhting to him? Nope. Her boss lately has been getting worse and worse with every outing but completely oblivious to his actions. While he is drinking he laughs it off and does not remember a thing the next day.  I am afraid he is heading in a really bad direction really fast.  Yuck

      How can I work so many hours a week plus do OT and still be broke? What happens to all my money? Wait I know, Whistler sucks it out of you!!!!!  There is alot to be said about living in a world class ski resort (or so they say) Your rent and cost of living are pretty much tripled and you work long hours and make less. Does that sound like the ultimate lifestyle? It must because I have been doing the ski resort thing for the past four years and I am still here, bitching as usual but nonetheless having the time of my life. Yeehaw!

      I think as a child Mother Nature must have been seriously neglected. She can be so evil I cannot quite figure it out.  I know living in the mountains you kind of have to expect the weather to change at any stage but this is crazy. I feel like I am in the twilight zone.  Last week were experiencing a heat wave like no other. Black slugs were being fried to the pavement. The looked like little black puddles of bubbling black lava. I was miserable last week, I slept with an icecube pack and barely any clothes on.  This week we have had nothing but rain, all day everyday. It has been so chilly that I actually went home one night after work and turned on the heat? What the F%^&? Now today of course it is sunny and beautiful?  I try and think whether I jinxed us by cursing Mother Nature last week while I was melting on my balcony or if she is just a miserable sad person who gets her kicks by torturing us on a daily basis? Does that seem normal to anyone?

      Ok so Whistler is an exciting playground for those Boys who like to play on Bikes. For some reason guys all decked out in mountain bike gear is quite appealing? Why I have no idea. They seem like quiet stuntmen looking for a thrill. Mnt. Biking is the next best thing to Ski/Riding in Whistler . I myself have not had the pleasure but everyone loves it.  So anyway, these 5 guys from the US just checked into the hotel for 4 days of mnt biking. Were they attractive, burley, rugged mnt. biker types that look like they would be cuddling professionals? YES. Does it make me want to pick up the sport of Mnt. Biking overnight so I can be their personal guide tomorrow morning? Yes. Will that happen?No! I will just settle for checking them in and out. Such is my luck. I can play foosball though. I can kick anyones ass in FOOSBALL! I am Foos-shark.  Ok some idiot pulled in the driveway the wrong way...It is one way only hence the big massive yellow arrow pointing out?  God Help us all.

      What is the rock bottom of boredom?  Counting the stripes on a peppermint candy? Counting the leaves on the lobby tree? Playing Tic Tac Toe by yourself?  Is there ever a point of boredom where there is mass destruction and the certainty of unemployment in your future?  Does labeling everything  not bolted to the floor with the office label maker grounds for termintation?  Would a lawyer take my case pro-bono if I were to sue for wrongful dismissal? Pro-bono like Matt Damon in The Rainmaker?  Hell I am bored.

      SO...what does one say in a blog? I am new, do I introduce myself? Who is it I am introducing myself to?  It feels very odd to throw my thoughts, emotions and ideas out there to anyone that is curious about the "Corrupted Slurpee"  My life is not that interesting that it warrants a blog, however my thoughts, and emotions are that disturbing that I might as well share them to those that are interested in things that are odd.  For example who is it that invented the "post-it note" I use post-it notes on a daily basis and it baffles me that there is probably a sole person out there that has made billions off the concept of a small notepad with sticky crap on the back. I could have thought of that and been a billionaire. Instead to make ends meet I am thinking of selling my first born child-whenever that happens-(10 years from now.)
