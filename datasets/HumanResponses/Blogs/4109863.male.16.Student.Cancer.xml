      I started cross country yesterday. I did pretty well, but I'm still nervous  about it. It's allot of hard work. Only five guys will make varsity with two back ups. So out of the sixteen guys that showed up, it would be a big thing if I could make the varsity team. We'll see how it turns out.

      It's a funny thing, color. What makes a different color more special or more appealing than another color. Why do we all have different favorite colors, colors that stand out to us more than another color. I think color, a favorite color, says allot about someone. How they think, what they enjoy, or don't enjoy. My favorite color would be red, followed by orange and then green. I say this for several reasons. Red is a color that stands out, it is a contrast to the surrounding world. It contrasts inself to the green grass, blue sky, and yellow sun. Orange has the same qualities as red, standing out. But the one element that can claim orange as it's color is the setting sun. I love the setting sun, because it's beautiful, but also because it's a sign that even though life is closing in one part of the world, it's just beginning in another. And I like green for an entirely different reason. Because green blends into the earth. It's so mellow, not jumping out at anyone, yet what would the world look like without grass or the green on the trees? It wouldn't be the same. In order for one color to stand out, another must blend in. As christians, we stand out because Jesus blended in for us on this earth; an earth full of hate, lies and deception. He chose to come as a child, blending in, bringing the news. We are to send out the news and contrast the world we live in. He was the green so we could be the orange and red.

      well, I guess it started in Hartville. That's where I was born. It is a little town, about 45 minutes south of Akron, where I live now. I lived in a big farm house, running free on over 50 acres of corn fields and farm land. We had lots of animals including dogs, horses, and rabbits. When I was five years old, my family moved to Akron, where I've lived ever since. So, most of my memories are from the city. For those of you who haven't been to Akron, it's a middle sized city of about 300,000 people. I like it here, it's a nice place and fairly comminity oriented. I have two brothers and two sisters that lived with me and my parents. My oldest brother was seventeen when I was born, so the age gap showed itself with him and my other siblings. Now, the oldest ones are gone, living in other states and places about America and soon beyond. When we moved from the country, my parents were against pets in the house, so we didn't have any. But now we have a black lab, Othello, and a grey tabby cat, Jackson. A lot of years have passed from those days in the farm house. There I began homschooling, for which I continued until 9th grade, where I went to a private, christian school in Cuyahoga Falls. This coming school year I'll be a sophmore. Allot has changed, allot had moved on, but I hope I can hold on to those farmyard years so long ago.

      I know I'm young; a young boy in a big world. But how old is truly old? You never truly can understand everything, nor learn everything there is to know. Everyone is learning, growing in maturity or understanding, whether for good or evil. So can an age be placed on knowledge? A thirty year old man may seem grown to a fourteen year old boy, but to a fifty year old man, the thirty year old merely seems like a young man. A person can not or will not stay the same. People constantly change. They grow, some up and some down, some out and some in, but their all growing. Though I'm not a grown man, no one truely is "grown up" untill he is with his Savior. Then he knows true knowledge. So do not let my youth discourage you. I am merely growing on another terrace or running on another path than those of different ages.
