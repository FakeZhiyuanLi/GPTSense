      Making the most of a cold winter in Cleveland::Never having tried skiing, and having two bad knees I managed convincing myself snowboarding would be easier. Hmmm not so sure this was the best thing to try one week in, but I did make it through.      urlLink Picture Detail    This ended up being one of the last sessions of the season. I am lead to believe that you can wakeboard in the summer though.

      OK so it looks like a painted garden shed, and technically you may well be correct. however to the kids it is a brand new "Wendy House / Fort / Spies Den" that Peter Pan would be proud of.    urlLink     So if you speak to them remember, "Do not Mention the Shed!!!"

      Well Josh and Alice continue their success at Willinghurst fisheries in Surrey. Josh fished the short pole for a mixed bag of roach, perch, and carp (Eleven fish total). Alice bagged this small carp and a nice Bream (which I&nbsp;did not think existed in the lake) on a wand down the right margin.     urlLink Picture Detail      urlLink Picture Detail    Oh yes and Daddy caught zip, nada, zero, diddly squatt and didn't they let me know it. If you are interested the fishery web site can be found at the following address; urlLink www.willinghurstfishery.co.uk    On this day we had Cherry Tree Lake to ourselves and it was fantastically peaceful (even with the kids!).

      Josh works hard to extract a giant block from the giant Jenga game, under the close supervision of Alice.

      And finally tonight... The lost bat "Zippy" believed to be being held hostage in Chester following a recent holiday has been seen busking in the midlands. One luck Brummy who was fortunate enough to hear zippy playing "stairway to bat cave", said yesterday&nbsp;"I got chatting to zippy&nbsp;and he hinted that he is saving up for a jiffy bag and a stamp, I think he's going to try and post himself home "    Zippy the bat yesterday, half way home.        urlLink  Zoom

Each canoe cost just £15 for the raw materials consisting of a flat bit of plastic and a few U shape bits of wood.         urlLink  Zoom     The brains behind the mission, Tim Simpson (pictured above left) winner of this years Red Bull flugtag (nutters flying into the serpentine competition), tested the boat design in a daring paddle before the production line commenced.

       urlLink     The recovery mission goes airbourne, following some intellligence that Zippy may be taking to the air. Gonzalez visits a local Berkshire airforce base to intercept Zippy and guide him home.

      Time was running out for Zippy. He had news from the shoe shine man on Canal Street that a search and recover team had been send from Wokingham but so far he had seen no sign. Shiny shoes though, bonus! Taking some time out to think, Zippy contemplated hijacking the helicopter, that way he'd be sure to be home for Tuesday, "about tea time" he pondered "jelly and cream buns".   urlLink      It was nice to take a break but deep down zippy knew this wasn't the answer, he'd never reach the peddles and anyway where would he land in Ashford ? Time to hit the road again, "a stiff drink and I'll be on my way" he though, "stiff upper lip, on with the show" and on he trudged...  urlLink

      Alice is pulling no punches as Zippy fails to arrive from Brum. She is seen here briefing Gonzalez on a special forces project to recover Zippy. Although the last pictures showed Zippy in or rather enjoying high spirits, it could be a slippery road from there on.   urlLink     Alice was heard to assign the following orders to Gonzalez before heading back inside to GHQ.   "Gonzales, head up the M40 ASAP and contact GHQ at the earliest opportunity with a positive ID on special agent Zippy. Do not stop until he is no longer MIA.  Gonzalez was last seen in Wokingham with no explanation for the detour.

       urlLink    OK here is my first attempt at the big air challenge 2004. I'd say that makes it Johnno's lead, over to you Stevey boy. Or are you going to add another clause to the rules that means I cannot measure this from the front of the wake?
