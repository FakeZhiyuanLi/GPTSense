      Today Vlad and I spend most of the day trying to find Anton, eventually he turns up after a 36 hour poker session.  During the day we visit the Mirage and see their mini zoo which included dolphins an elephant and white lions. Vlad decides to go on the roller coaster at New York New York and I decide top play pi gow poker while does this, in the 15 min session I win $28 with far less effort than when playing normal poker.   In the evening we go to the Belligo at about 11pm and play in their $2-5 no limit game. The players here aren't particularly soft and the game is actually quite hard. I make the mistaken move of hanging around playing until about 6:30am and although gradually treading water for most of the time but manage to lose $600 in the last hour of play with a couple of bad moves I try out. Today wasn't a great poker day!

      Well we are halfway through our trip on yet another scroching day in vegas (43 degrees) though at least it's dry heat.  I hope Anton turns up cos without mobile phone contact we really don't know where to look for him.  I haven't been doing very much except playing poker and eating ice cream (the best way of staying cool).  I haven't won any yet, but haven't lost any either and got some free drinks along the way which was nice.  Live cash games can be quite hard work to play properly - u can go literally for hours without playing a hand and then everyone folds when u raise with pocket aces.

      Got up late, had buffet at the luxor and then hit the card room there. Played their $1-1-2 NL holdem game. The game was strange as it had a max of a $50 buyin but as soon as you had less than $50 you could pull up for another $50. The game was particularly soft and after 5 hours play I was $230 in profit. One remarkable hand that sticks in my mind was one I played with a crazy player that I had been having a fair amount of cheeky banter with. In late position I pick JJ and make it $10 to play, in the small blind he calls and we are heads up. The flop comes 335 and it is checked to me, I bet $20 and get check raised a further $20. i accuse the crazy bald headed player of check raise bluffing me and go allin for a further $60. He thinks for ages and calls with 72 suited (but there was no flush draw)! Crazy but I think that it was partly motivated by his 94off hitting two pair against my KK with which I raised a few Hands earlier. Anyway with players like this despite the high rake and small buyin the game was profitable.  Fell asleep early though vlad and I are still waiting to find Anton who disappeared to play poker on Monday at about 3:30pm and it is now 12:30pm on the Tuesday.  Right I'm off to go and see some dolphins, heres vlad for a special guest entry.

      After a hectic day of poker on saturday Sunday was allways going to be relatively poker free. I got up with a bit of hangover went to the gym and lifted some weights ran and swam. It was nice to feel a little active after so much sitting at the poker table. After lunch Vlad and I went down town to visit the poker mecca of binions horseshoe casino, true to my promise i was restrained enough to avoid signing up to any games.  It wasnt till late that night that I was sitting at the poker table in the sahara, not feeling to great I called it a day after an hour $95 down having not really played many hands, calling some raises hoping to hit trips and missing. After leaving the game I went off for a few drinks to try and help me sleep in this 24 hour city.

      Strangely for me I am finding it a little difficult to sleep whilst in Vegas I work up after only about 6 hours sleep today. This is extremely unusual for me although I have heard others complain Vegas has this effect on them.  After the breakfast buffet in my hotel me and the guys headed down the strip to investigate some of the different casinos. The size of these hotels is truly amazing, I am shocked that enough people can ever come to stay to justify the grandeur of them. My highlight today was seeing a white tiger in one of the casinos.  Well Anton and I eventually managed to find ourselves a game in the Mandalay Bay card room at about 3:30pm. I signed up for the $2-4 NL Holdem game with a $200 buyin. This game ended up being a very frustrating experiance with lots of bad beats at the begining of the session. I seemed to be playing well but just had massive outdraws made on me when the money was already in. Well rightly or wrongly I still thought that I could beat this game and continued to rebuy after lossing my stack numerous times. At my lowest point I was down about $500 but I dont think this really effected my play and I was determined to get at least even on the session. Well after about 12 hours of hard grinding I was back into the profit region with $700 in front of me (at this stage i was in for $675) It was now 3:30am, I had had no breaks other than the odd trip to the loo, all my friends had long left the card room and I hadnt eaten since breakfast. I got up caught a cab home and eat a blue berry pancake before going to bed.  My faverite/best play of the day was a hand where I played my pocket Kings well. In early position I made a rasie making it $10 to go, a dealer at the Palms casino who was a very vocal player raised this another $30 making it now $40 to go. Everyone else in the pot folded and it was left to me, at this stage I definately didnt put the guy on Aces for lots of reasons. I decide that I will flat call and check to him on the flop. This is what I do when the flop comes down 24Q no flush draws, he bets a further $50 and I check raise hime allin for a further $70 which he begrudgingly calls saying he is pot committed. He turns over pocket sevens. Like many pots in the begining stages of this game things didnt really go well for me and he hit his two outer on the turn winning the pot. I still like the way this hand played though.  I think that I will need a break from poker on sunday, saturday has been a draining day...   Daily profit/loss +$25

      I wake up fully refreshed at 6:30am local time. Head to the hotel gym and have a run on the treadmill and then do some weights. I am feeling fresh and ready for Vegas.  After the Gym Vlad and I head down to the buffet stuff our faces and then head out to check out some casinos. I was impressed to see that the MGM grad had a cage for Lions in the middle of its Casino, i was less impressed by their lack of a card room. In the end we end up in the Excalibar card room and get outselves into a $1-2 NL Holdem game with $100 buyin. This is more like it the game I have been perfecting my skill at for the last 2 years. Well the game is generally good the is a real mix of players at the game and the general age is far lower than the limit ganes. I get stuck into action and ten hours of constant play later I end up increasing my $100 stake to $688. This was a result of not getting very unlucky and generally playing a very stright forward solid game. If things keep going like this the holiday should be a breeze, winning is far easier to deal with than lossing. Toward the end of the ten hour session (10:30 am -8:30pm) I have the great idea of making use of the free drinks and gradually start getting merry. We leave meet my mate Anton who just arrived and spent the rest of the evening on the piss...

      I arrive in Vegas after a 14 hour flight via houston. The journey was uneventfull thought the texan accents were very funny on the plan, it was just a shame there was no one with me to laugh with. On arriving in vegas at 3:30pm local time I met up with vlad and checked into the hotel. After some food and freshing up I broke the advice I have read countless times in poker books and headed to the sahara casino to check out the card room. I have to say that I wasnt very impressed the room was only offering 2-4$ limit games and the place and the players looked very shabby. Well hey I joined in a game and played for an hour and was remuinded how dull it is to play limit profitably. It is far worse live than online as the hand rate is less and you can't watch TV. Well after an hour of slightly loose play I decided to call it a day with a $45 loss. Jet lag was settling in and i have decided i cant be bother with low stakes limit.  I fall asleep at 9:30pm local time, bring on tomorrow.   Current profit lose -$45

      Those of you that know me will be aware that I came to Cambridge in 1996 as a fresh faced 18 year old. Since then I have been studying without a break for eight years having collected a BA MSci MA and hopefully in a month or so also a PhD.  Over the last few years I have been introducing myself to the game of poker and in this time I have spent a lot of time becoming better at the game. I have been lucky to be able to play poker at a time where it is really taking off online, this has ment that earning a reasonable living allowance from it has been possible. I am not at all sure this would have been possible 10 years ago.  As my PhD was coming to an end and a job in September was looming I had to try and get away and visit the Mecca of the poker world that is Vegas. This is happening later this week, I fly out on Thursday.  fortunately for me I have been running good over the last month or two and I have decided to put these winning to go use and use them to pay for my trip. I have cashed out £1600 from my Victor Chandler account and plan to use this as a bankroll and spending money whilst away. I shall keep you informed of how this figure changes during the course of the holiday. My flights ended up expensive but this cost has been paid for by a series of good results in my last three trips to live casino cash games.  To start this blog off in a poker related way I shall describe a hand of Omaha high that I played last week in the gutshot club in London. I like to think that the piece of luck involved in this hand paid for my return flights. I am not sure I played this hand very well, I certainly gambled but hey that appears to be the spirit of Omaha. Lets just hope that when in Vegas my luck holds up and my skill level increases. Well I shall be playing Holdem there and I certainly know more about playing holdem than Omaha.  Ok the game is £1-2 blinds dealers choice, I am in the big blind with about £250 in front of me and the game called is Omaha. I am dealt 10 10 9 6 and nine people see the flop in an unrasied pot.  The flop comes 10 7 8 (two clubs) giving me bottom straight and top set.  I bet out the pot (£18) have one caller and then get raised (£72) by the short man to my left this is then flat called by the bald man (catman) to his left and everyone else folds, I flat call and three of us see the turn. The pot is now £306  The turn brings a blank 2 (not of clubs) I check, the short man bets allin for £50 catman then goes allin over the top for another £100. So I am facing paying £150 to win £506. At this point I am fed up that I had got myself into this mess. I think that both players have j9 in their hands. I therefore have 10 outs from the 40 cards left unknown. Without quite the pot odds but close to them I call. By this stage I have given up hope that my small straight could possibly win.  The river comes the 8 making me the full house and collecting a £656 pot. As it happens both players had j9 one a flush draw with it the other a wrap to a high straight.  Well hopefully from now on I shall be able to tell you about lots more holdem pots that I win whilst away; I also hope that I can feel a little prouder than I did in the last pot ;)

      Ok so I finished my PhD Thesis last Friday and have spent the weekend celebrating. I am now back in my office in the Physics department feeling strange as for the first time in four years I really have no academic work to do. I do however have lots of things to sort out before my Vegas Holiday can happen this coming Thursday. One of these admin duties is to set up this weblog. The idea behind this is that it will enable me to keep a  record of my holiday and hopefully by writing everything down this will help restrain any lossing streaks I may have at the poker tables.  Ok many more details will be added soon but enough for now, I have insurance, cash and a PhD exam to organise...
