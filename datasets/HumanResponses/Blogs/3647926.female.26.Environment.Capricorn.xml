          I urge you to see Fahrenheit 911. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which paper burns. The book of this title written by Ray Bradbury is one of censorship. Michael Moore's latest movie I would say is one of the censoring of our very freedom. Power is Knowledge and often times the citizens of this country are powerless and the "knowledge" is packaged for us.       There was an initial conflagration of anger and guilt that ravaged my mind after seeing the documentary last night. After leaving the theatre, during the drive home watching the post industrial scenery, half listening to what my friends were saying about the film, feeling the pull of gravity as we zoomed across the landscape in smooth vectors and sharp curves my outrage simmered into a blanket of empathic and calculating embers that fell across my body like fireworks.       Yes, the processing of these feelings was like a fireworks show. Loud thundering booms exploding, bright and distinct. Then slowly spidering across the sky of my body only to be followed up by the loud clap of another distinct emotion. Powerful. Violently raping the quiet peaceful sky with sound and light. When I closed the car door and entered the chilly night air my burning did not cease. It will simmer waiting to burn the very essence of injustice. As I heard the teapot whistle I thought, "But how?" This is where my headache revolves. How? To what end? By myself our with many? Who will listen? Who will care? How do I destroy injustice in my own way? How do I reclaim the power of knowledge? I closed my eyes and fell asleep feeling unsure yet empowered.  See the movie. Vote in November. Buy the DVD. Make your friend watch it, your neighbors too. Talk, talk, talk. Network. Take a deep breath and dive in.  Ciao

      A deep and centering feeling. It does not back down or forget. Makes you look at yourself and rejoice. If you have any doubt its not love. Feels like a sickness sometimes-taking over all thoughts. Comforting, so comforting replacing fear with fizz and tingle. How can a feeling be so influential?

      The other day I was listening to Ray Charles' "America" while I was reading the lastest AdBusters magazine. The article was historically stating how the immigrants that came to North America in the early 1500's sytematically killed the buffalo and Native Americans that thrived here for centuries. There was a picture that showed the immigrants shooting buffalo, another picture showed buffalo corpses littered across an a plain. Just then Ray Charles savory voice warmed "I'm talkin' about America, America, God shed his grace on thee." I motioned to turn the CD off but decided not to and lingered in that moment of stiff irony. My eyes swelled with disillusioned tears as the history of America zipped quickly through my mind. The type of "brotherhood" that shaped America is not congruent with the "brotherhood" in our should be national anthem. Perhaps the reality of a truly beautiful country died with Ray Charles last week too.

      It was the summer of 1999. I was home from college. It had been a fun filled day of hanging with my older brother in downtown Houston. We crashed at his place instead of heading out to the super suburbs where our folks live. It was like we were little again, we shared one bed and slept head to toe. I love him. Anyway, I fell asleep hard and fast. The dream I dreamt would stay with me forever.  The dream started off normal regenerating the day's events in an soft, airy light. My brother and I were riding on the city bus talking and goofing on each other. I was sitting in the window seat. I could tell my brother was smiling as he was talked as I gazed out the window unto the congested city street... to be continued

      I heard a thud. I woke up foggy eyed. I still had my contacts in, when I blinked they did not move or make me see clearer. Was I dreaming or was I really sleeping in a car in the right lane of Interstate 91 in Northern Vermont. Yes.. yes I was. It was really foggy out and the car windows were imprinted our breath which made it really hard to see outta them. I heard a thud again and this time felt it too. It was followed by a drunken outburst, "PHISH!" then, "VERRRRRRRrMMoNNNNT!" I opened the car door into the darkness and asked the crew boisterous lads to kindly not hit our vehicle. Sheepishly they agreed. I slammed the door and tried to go back to sleep. Looking at the clock I realized is was 12:43 am. My friend and I had been in the same spot stuck in motionless traffic for a little over 7 hours at the point. As the dome light faded an 18 wheeler WHOOSED! by on our left rocking the Subaru just enough to unsettle my nerves as I fought to fall asleep. The previous daylight hours included leaving New Haven, CT at 10:30 am, driving up I-91 for 5 hours and coming to a complete hault on the freeway.   It was about 4:30 p.m. when we hit the mosaic of endless automobiles ahead of us. It was not long after that that the tail of this metal monster grew quickly and as far as the eye could see behind us. Between our arrival and DARK:30 kindred PHISH fans moved their cars between 5 to 50 feet at a time every half hour or so. Inbetween that we mingled with each other in the corridor that was formed by the right lane and the shoulder(which also had become a lane of endless traffic). The left lane was clear for other travellers to get up to their northernly destinations and also for sneaky Phisheads to cut in line!   Anyway back to the Corridor of Delight: We met people that travelled as far as Oregon and Washington State to see the final Phish show. Phish is a band with boundless talent. They have been togther since the early 90's and even though their fans hate to compare them to The Grateful Dead- their like Grateful Dead. Unfortunatly for music lovers the band is breaking up and August 14-15th is their last show.   There were ladies, gents, 40 somehthings, kids barely pushing legal, dogs and even some little kids that made of the Phish Train and the resulting Corridor of Delight. Everyone was hopeful and told you their story of how long, how far, how many shows they'd been to. Above all everyone without speaking enacted the story of peace. There were literally thousands of cars in line. Even though trash was a problem thousands of people created a warm, loving vibe as we inched toward Exit 26. We were 20 miles away from the exit and another 12 miles from Coventry Airport where the hippy jam band deluxe would play the following day at 5 pm.  I've waited in line at the gas station and gotten flustered, but there was something totally chill about the wait and by DARK:30 we had been waiting 5 hours. The calm and peacefulness took all the angst out of waiting- and wait we did.  Previous to our arrival it had rained for at least two days. During our drive up we got caught in some nasty down pours too. Nature was not on our side. As the light travelling from billions of mile away faded through the cloud cover scores of earth travellers climbed in their cars, trucks, SUVs, RV's and other things with wheels and snuggled up with a blanket and attempted to sleep. Always watchful for the color of red brake lights from cars ahead (because that meant we were moving) Phishers balanced in the night hours suspended between the surreal waking world and the allure of much needed sleep.   The clouds were high and clearing as the sun revealed itself Saturday morning. At 6:38  I saw folks playing frisbee in the left lane and young guys holding beer bottles in the Corridor of Delight. I took a lengthy stroll down the corridor following the flow of what would be traffic. Lots of Phishers were still asleep but many ate bagels, used bottled water to brush their teeth, and smoked various smokey things that smoked. I walked for a good mile when I realized traffic had not moved for 14 hours. In back of my mind I knew something was wrong.   From where we were on I-91 the view was spectacular. Layer after layer of green hills and mountains painted the back drop, wild flowers sang on the sides of the road and finally after a day the distant sun shone softly. The light warmed my back as I retraced my footsteps toward the car. It was like a moving city and it was great! My walk had induced a movement- while I had a movement of the bowels Phish fans experienced their first traffic movement in over 14 hours. As I walked to the side of the road and into the deep dark woods- to do my movement- I heard horns honking and people cheering fore they had displaced 60 feet in less that 30 seconds. After climbing down the hill and reaching the side of the road-feeling quite relieved might I add- I realized the car was gone and I had to find it.   As I walked up the Corridor of Delight the Phish Train moved again. So traffic was shuffling on both sides of me as I causually walked, waving at drivers as I passed them. I was walking faster than traffic was moving! After awhile I found my friend and the car. The scene was charged with excitment- we had all travelled far and hard, slept in traffic overnight, used the Facilatree and roughed the weather and WE WERE GOING TO SEE PHISH! Traffic hadn't moved in for awhile when someone yelled "RADIO UPDATE! TRAFFIC REPORT!" We all got quiet and tuned into to Bunny Radio the official Phish Coverage Station. In less than a minute a Phish Member and the Vermont State Police made hundreds of thousands of hours of driving in vein.   The Millie Vanille? Brothers once sang a song called "Don't Blame It On the Rain" but in our case it was just that that turned a scene of hope and peace into sea of screams, rage and dishovled looks. Due to public safety ordinaces between 30-40 THOUSAND people were turned away from the entrance gates and told to go home. It was true the camp ground that was due to hold 70,000 Phish Fans became so wrought with rain that when cars drove on it they would sink into the mud and have to towed away. My ears became hot as I listened to the announcement over the radio. Only 20,000 ticket holders actually had gotten in when we started south bound on I-91. We were swearing and cursing and screaming and crying as we drove.   As we bitterly peered across the divider moving in the southernly direction our eyes soaked up the seriousness of the issue as they saw the north bound traffic backed up for at least another 15 miles- We had been 30 miles total from the gate.  We never made it to Exit 26, nor to Route 5 North nor Airport Road leading to where it would all take place. This was to be my first Phish show and their last one. I hope somehow they can make it up to all their die hard fans that came to support them and even to the newbees like me.  The friend I was with said it best, "It wasn't a good experience or a bad experience, but definately an experience."------
