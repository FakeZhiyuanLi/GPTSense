      So, it is Sunday night about 1 in the morning here in Indy.  It is Memorial Day weekend, so no work until Tuesday, which is fabulous! YAY!  I've really accomplished my goal this weekend of having a positive attitude and not being so sensitive.  Today, especially, was really nice.  I actually spent the night at my apartment, which may have been the first time all week.  And I spent the day cleaning and organizing.  It is not completely finished, but I can see light at the end of the tunnel for sure, and it is a very nice feeling.  We also bought some paint for the walls in the dining area, which will be a lot of fun.  I'm really happy for Dana.  She has met a new guy, Dan (go figure that would be his name, right?) But anyways...he is really great.  I like him a lot.  He is her age, 19, which is easy to forget sometimes because he seems so mature.  If something more comes of it, I think he will be really good for Dana.  He is really responsible.  He has a great job working as a mechanic for BMW and he owns his own house and at least 2 vehicles, completely financially stable at 19 which is beyond amazing.  But the more important thing than all of that is that he seems to be a real sweetheart.  He is treating Dana really well so far, which she totally deserves and needs.  She really seems to like him so much too, which makes me so happy.  I hope that she can see that this is the type of guy she can be with.  Somebody whose life is actually going somewhere and who treats her well.  I know that it will still be difficult for her to move on with her life and completely cut off things with Daniel (the ex, not Dan the new guy), but hopefully she will be able to see how much better she can do.  I foresee good things (or I really hope anyway).  So that's that.  And...well, I got an email from Uli.  Crazy.  I just had to laugh right out loud.  So, she and Ovi have been spending a lot of time together.  I had a feeling that he may be interested in her, but lo and behold, she seems to be interested too.  She said that he gave her a big hug and was holding her hand this week and her heart was racing.  Wow!  I mean what can I say.  I've always thought that Ovi was a great guy, even if we didn't completely hit it off due to the situation with Paul.  So I think it is really fantastic for Uli.  But I have to laugh I really do.  I mean Ovi is Paul's best friend.  So...Paul cut off things with Uli because he wanted things to beyond friendship without an actual commitment.  And she wasn't willing to have a relationship with him beyond friendship because of me and my history with Paul, which she told Paul, and knowing him as well as I do, I know he wasn't happy about that.  So, now, Paul's best friend may be hooking up with Uli.  And she and I, despite the distance, are just about best friends.  Poor Paul...haha.  Karma, my friend, karma.  Paul and Ovi have a special relationship so I don't quite know how this turn of events will affect things, but Paul could not possibly be happy about it.  I really shouldn't be happy that things are turning out so badly for him, but I don't know, I guess there is an evil side in all of us.  I just can't help but think it is a bit funny.  But more than anything I wish that he would think about everything and realize that it is his actions that put him in such a situation.  He pushes away all of the people who care about him.  Okay enough about that...Oh, but jeez it is funny...  Now, it's just about time for me to snuggle up to my sweet Joey, I do love that man...Life, again, is good.

      I'm sad today.  And last night.  I don't know what is wrong with me.  I think I may be having anxiety attacks.  I don't even like myself lately.  Last week was very very bad, but I thought that I had gotten over that, calmed down a bit.  But last night was the same as last week.  It is like I cannot take an ounce of criticism.  If anybody says anything negative, I take off on this downward spiral.  I don't even recognize myself anymore.  I guess there are still traces of me, but where is that happy girl.  Duey Lightfoot once told me that he loved being around me because he had never seen me without a smile on my face.  Granted, back when he knew me, my life was a lot less complicated.  I make my own complications.  I always said that because I know that I do that, and I make my choices anyway, I would deal with the consequences. But sometimes it is really hard.  I really miss my friends.  But would that even really make things better? Or is it just something inside of me that I need to conquer?  It is the stress of trying to take care of Dana?  I do feel that is a huge part of things, but I do not want to blame others.  Not Dana, not Joe, nobody, this is my problem and I know I have to find a way out myself.  And I will.  I'm still that eternal optimist.  I will find my positive outlook.  I will not let these feelings take control.  I have to find a focus.  I have to be less sensitive.  I'm so sensitive and it is getting ridiculous.  I don't know how other people stand to be around me.  Today, in my car on my way to work, I screamed as loudly as I can.  I can't stand being around myself even, so I cannot imagine why anyone else wants to be around me.  I wish I could go to the ocean.  Lie on the beach, feel nature all around me. Decompress.  I'm driving Dana up the wall.  I'm so sorry about that.  I have to try harder.  I will be happy this weekend.  I will get things accomplished.  I will be me.  The fun Kari.  The one who smiles and has fun no matter what.  That is my goal.  I will find my sunshine.

      I'm such a slacker. When I know that I'm way ahead of my deadline, I cannot work. Oh well, gives me more time to write, right? Hehe. So, we were supposed to go play disc golf today but the weather.com shows lots of rain.  bummer!  We didn't go on Tuesday when we were supposed to either.  I bought new inline skates and haven't used them yet either. The weather needs to get nice soon.  I'm getting stir crazy.  Nobody really seems to want to work today. I can hear people hanging around each other's desks chatting.  Well, it IS the week of the race, and we DO live in Indianapolis.  How are we supposed to focus?    Changing the subject, I miss Uli.  I wish sometimes I was still in Regensburg hanging out with her everyday. I think that I've given up on the idea of studying in Germany for a while. I don't know.  I'm just afraid to leave this job because it is truly an amazing opportunity, and I really love it.  Despite the fact that I'm terrible about procrastinating, I do a good job.  Plus, I'm getting licensed next month.  Last night, Joe talked about me supporting him while he goes back to school.  I actually would have no problem with that, so long as I could afford it.  I'll be his Suga' Mamma ;) But giving up on my dream to study in Germany...Hell, this may be my last chance.  I promised myself I would never live my life regreting.  I always want to take the chances.  That's why I left Houston and came here to Indy in the first place.  It was still really early in Joe and my relationship, but I had fallen in love with him and though it was a huge step...moving 1,000 miles with a guy I'd only been with like 6 months at that point...I thought I had to take the chance, or I might have regretted it later.  Wondering what might have been, I don't want that. But if I did go to Germany to study, would that screw up things with Joe and I?  And would I regret leaving this job?  I can only imagine how amazing it would be to stay there long enough to completely be fluent in German.  And I know that Uli and I would really become the best of friends.  We're already great friends despite the ocean between us.  I guess I will sit back, try to save money, and see what life has in store for me. Sound like a good plan?

      I went to Circle Bar Saloon last night for the art show "8" (which also happens to be my favorite number).  It was really fabulous.  Everything from culinary arts to belly dancers to amazing paintings. It has inspired me to start painting again.  Joe went with me, and I think he actually enjoyed it. He was really making an effort last night, and I love him for that.  We're going to be okay. I know that now. We're going to stand by each other and work through whatever problems come up. I had been overwhelmed before.  That's what happens when I try to fix everything myself. I get overwhelmed and I start thinking there is no way to make things better except to run away. I don't regret the past. I did what I had to do. I had to have closure before I moved on with my life with Joe.  Be careful what you ask for, I guess.  I most certainly got closure.  Closure and a kick in the ass.  It's still hard to believe that that was the end.  After all these years. After everything that we went through, all that we shared, and that was how everything ended.  But it by no means was my fault. I gave him every opportunity to stay friends with me.  I poured my heart out to him the way I always did. But I guess things change. I always loved that we could speak our minds to each other.  Tell each other everything, exactly what we were feeling, without holding back. But that didn't work this time.  He wasn't willing to be my friend. Not a friend in the true sense of the word.  He would be my friend if that were an easy thing. If it took no effort on his part.  But with our past, some effort was required. So many empty promises. I wish I never would have believed a word he said. Did he really change so much?  Or did I just believe in an illusion?  Was he never really the person that I thought he was?  I keep being reminded of Strange Attraction by the cure  it started with a dedication "lost in admiration - happy birthday - i'm forever yours" blossom faded red inside a tiny book of butterflies  i smiled surprised at how when flickered through  the wings flew by spelled out my name...  six months went by the summer lost obsessively the letters dropped into my life  the same soft blood smooth flowing hand  "please try to understand - i have to see you - have to feel you -  tell you all the ways i need you - yours forever in love... "  strange attraction spreads it's wings it varies but the smallest things you never know how anything will change strange attraction spreads it's wings and alters but the smallest things you never know how anything will fade  the year grew old incessantly she wrote to me  she'd started smoking poetry!  i laughed in recognition of a favourite phrase  she pulled me in...  i answered her  a christmas card in sepia arranging when and where  and how the two of us should meet...  her opening so well prepared  a nervous smile  i couldn't take my eyes from her  she whispered  "can i use some of your lipstick?"  it was perfect so believable  i couldn't help but feel that it was real  and kissing crimson fell into her waiting arms...  strange attraction spreads it's wings it varies but the smallest things you never know how anything will change strange attraction spreads it's wings and alters but the smallest things you never know how anything will fade  so alone into the cold new year without another word from her  i wrote to ask if we could maybe meet again before the spring  but weeks went by with no reply until once more my birthday came  and with it my surprise but this time nothing was the same...   "i'm sorry - blame infatuation - blame imagination -  i was sure you'd be the one but i was wrong -  it seems reality destroys our dreams - i won't forget you" blossom faded red inside a tiny book of old goodbyes...    strange attraction spreads it's wings it varies but the smallest things you never know how anything will change strange attraction spreads it's wings and alters but the smallest things and you never know...   But you know what? Forget all that, it's over and done with...finally. I have a new TRUE love in my life now. I just got an email from him. I love the way that he loves me. The way that he makes my heart soar. Just looking into those gorgeous green eyes.  I'm going to be with him for the rest of my life and I love him more than anything. I see that clearly now.

      Things were really bad this weekend.  Dana's temper went completely out of control.  I haven't seen her like that in years.  It was truly scary.  I told her that I didn't want Daniel staying even one night at my apartment...that didn't go over very well.  So I called Dad thinking that he could talk some sense into her and get her to respect my wishes since the apartment is mine and in my name and all of that.  Well, instead of trying to reason with her, Dad basically told Dana that if she went back to that abusive relationship that he and Mom have tried so many times to do what all they can to help her, but they can't keep on doing it over and over again if she keeps going back to him.  He said that the next time she gets into a situation with Daniel and she wants to get away, she should call the police rather than call Mom and Dad.  He basically told her that if she makes this decision that they aren't going to have much to do with her anymore.  Okay, so I can understand why she flipped out.  I totally didn't expect Dad to be so hard on her.  But maybe I'm too easy on her.  She's going back to an abusive relationship, but it seems that no matter what I say it is not going to change her mind.  I suppose I've somewhat given up.  I don't want her to get hurt, but it seems inevitable.  But the thing is she flipped out on me rather than on Dad.  She told me that I have betrayed her more than any other person in her life.  And many times over she told me that she hated me.  Her words didn't affect me too much because I know she was saying it out of anger.  And in truth, I've never really betrayed her.  In her mind, my calling Dad and telling them about her decision to go back to Daniel in Houston was a betrayal.  I think that she didn't want to tell Mom and Dad because she actually knows what a bad choice she is making.  Maybe I'm being selfish now, but I'm not fighting it anymore.  I'm tired of it.  Even if I found a way to change her mind this time, in a matter of time, she would want to go back again and I can't keep dealing with it over and over again.  It is making me crazy.  And the condition of the apartment.  I spent hours upon hours cleaning it this weekend.  It looks really good now.  But she has already basically ruined the carpet.  If she stays here longer, who knows what else I'll have to pay for.  I know that is a selfish way to look at things, and if I thought that I could actually change her mind I wouldn't care about all of those things but I've tried and tried, and I don't think there is anymore I can do.  Before I changed her mind the last time, I became thoroughly depressed dealing with the whole situation.  I mean, I haven't felt that depressed in a very long time, and now that she is right back to where she started wanting to give him another chance when he hasn't at all proved he is worthy of it...I can't fight it anymore.  I've given up.  I hope with all of my heart that she'll be okay, but I give up.

      So, life is crazy. (What else is new?) If my life weren't crazy, I don't think I would know what to do. So...Dana is moving back to Houston.  What can I say?  I think it's a huge mistake.  I don't think she will be happy.  Maybe at first things will be okay with her and her idiot ex (or I guess current) boyfriend.  Since they haven't seen each other for a while, I'm sure he'll be on his best behavior for a while.  I really think that after a little while things will go back to the way they were.  I know that she loves him.  And I know how hard it is to let go of someone that you love, even if you know that is what you should do. Believe me, I know.  I had to learn my lesson the hard way, and I suppose she will to.  I just hope he doesn't hurt her too badly, emotionally and physically.  The fact that I'm no longer able to take care of my baby sister breaks my heart.  I wish that I could just wrap my arms around her and keep her safe from any future pain.  Unfortunately, I can't.  She is an adult now, and she has to make her own mistakes, I suppose.  I wish her the best.  I truly do.  I don't support her choices, but I hope that somehow she finds a way to be happy.  I will always love you my Dana-bee.  I know your lovely soft caring heart, and I hope that it doesn't lead you to any more pain.  I don't want her to leave me.  There is this ache in my throat and in my heart.  But I guess I have to let go. The only positive thing about the whole situation is that Joe and I will live together again.  We basically do now, but there will be no need to transport clothes back and forth and so on... And a bit of privacy will be nice too.  Don't get me wrong, I love all the guys that we hang out with. But they are there practically all of the time.  They even invite each other there without asking one of the actual people who live at the condo if it is okay.  It is a pretty funny situation.  I'm glad that Joe has found so many good friends.  And I almost feel guilty that I want him to come live with me at my apartment because I feel like I will somewhat break the cycle that we are in now.  Almost every evening all of us tend to migrate to Joe and Andy's condo.  I imagine one of 2 things will happen.  Either, Joe and I will still hang out frequently at the condo, despite the fact that he won't live there anymore, or people will migrate to our apartment to hang out.  I kind of think it will be the former, especially because Jay will be moving into the condo.  If it would just be Andy there, then I would have my doubts that it would remain the hangout place, but since Andy and Jay will be living there, I can see everything relatively staying the same.   I haven't written here for a while.  I finished taking my licensing classes, and I passed the test. Yay!  So now I just have to send in the app, fee, and paperwork, and I am a licensed producer.  I also met this really cool girl who was in the class with me.  In fact, I really need to call her soon.  She seemed like somebody I could get to be good friends with.  Well, there's more to say, but I'll leave that for another day.

      So I've been spending the morning reading my textbook for my Life & Health Licensing class I take next week.  Pretty interesting stuff...let me tell ya.  Scott didn't come into work today because they are having people remodel their house.  So it's just me here trying to stay focused until it is time to go home.  I'm a little bit nervous about my class next week considering it has been nearly 2 years since I've taken any kind of class.  I think I'm getting old.  I want to go back to school, mostly just because I feel like I'm growing up too fast.  Life is good, though.  I'm proud of where I am now.  The struggles that I have made it past, defeated, conquered.  Yeah, I did good. Joe and I had a fabulous night together last night.  I went over to his place just to pick up my phone that I had accidentally left there, and I ended up not going back to my place until this morning to change clothes and head straight to work.  Considering that I can't remember the last time I actually slept at my apartment, it is basically a glorified closet.  Joe really is the sweetest.  I love him more everyday.  The way he holds me and looks at me, it just doesn't get old; it still makes my heart race even though we've been together for a while now. So, I absolutely have to go to FNM tonight.  I was supposed to go last week, and didn't quite make it in time.  I think I was there for the last round, maybe.  Joe and I have plans to go out for sushi afterwards. Oddly enough, I don't know if I'm in the mood for sushi, so maybe I'll try something else today.  Get some Lo Mein or something; that sounds yummy to my tummy.  I really need to spend time studying this weekend, so I hope the guys don't have too many fun plans because it will be hard for me to not want to go even though I know what I need to get done.  Surely, I have enough self-discipline for one week though.  I'm not really that worried.  I'm a procastinator without a doubt, but in the end I always pull through.  I had a great conversation with Uli today.  She is the absolute sweetest, ever.  I wish so much that she didn't live thousands upon thousands of miles away.  It would be so unbelievably awesome if we could live in the same place.  It has been a long time since I have had a female best friend.  She and I are so much alike too.  Maybe someday.  Crazier things have happened.  Uli told me that she talks about me to Ovi all of the time, and that he thinks I'm wonderful.  If you would listen to her, you would think that I have no faults, when in actuality I have an abundance of them, but I'm happy that she sees the good side of me.  And I'm really happy for Ovi to have a good opinion of me.  You know this part of me hopes that Ovi gets to know me really well and we become good friends, and then he tells Paul that he thinks that he is crazy for ending things with me.  Not that that would get me anywhere.  I'm totally happy and in love with Joe.  And it is not like I will ever make that mistake (Paul) again.  I just want him to realize how much he hurt me and how it could have been.  And I'm honestly talking about as friends because looking back, I think wanting more than that may have always been a mistake.  But at one time we were really special friends, and it would have been nice to have that always.  But as I told Uli today, everything that happened between Paul and I is worth it because I got to meet her and we became such good friends. Well, I suppose maybe I should get back to reading this fantastically interesting textbook! :D

      I had my lunch at the park. It was especially nice today.  I focused on the sounds of nature. The insects, birds, thunder, the light rain. So gloriously beautiful.  I could have just sat there all day long listening.  Reading and listening.  It was all so relaxing. I could forget anything that troubles me.  My feelings of solitude don't matter when I'm there because in that place solitude suits me. It is what I want.  I could forget it all.  I even feel like I don't care anymore.  I don't care about all of the pain I have been feeling lately because my feelings are not important.  Instead of that thought making me more depressed it makes me feel free.  To be outside of myself and my thoughts and my feelings and everything that has brought me down lately, to immerse myself in nature, in peace, to find a happiness within myself and no longer feel the need to look for that happiness elsewhere.

      I got a call from Ludwig yesterday. I miss him. I miss my apartment in Houston where he would come over and we would drink together and watch my crappy non-cable tv and he would laugh over my frozen banana in the freezer. I think back to that semester I lived at Cullen Oaks, which was arguably the worst time in my life. But that was the time that Ludwig and I became the friends that we are today. He was there for me when I had no one else.  He tried to take care of me the best he could, which I know was extremely difficult because I can be stubborn and independent.  He never gave up on me, even when I felt hopeless and practically gave up on myself.  And I know that even now, if I called him and told him that I needed him right this minute, he would drop everything and find a way to get here and help me with whatever it may be, big or small.  He is so much like me too.  It still amazes me.  I was reading his blog that he wrote while he was studying in France.  Some of the things he wrote could have come straight from my mouth.  I wish that he still wrote in his blog because reading it was one of my favorite things to do.  His words almost always put a smile on my face.  Sometimes I laughed so hard over what he wrote that my sides hurt.  I hope that someday we live close together again.  At least, in July, he will be visiting me here in Indy.  That will be so awesome.  I'm thoroughly excited.  He's one of the best friends I have ever had, maybe the best ever.  I sit here sometimes and feel sorry for myself, but look at all the wonderful people I have in my life.  I'm so lucky. I need to remember that.

      This past weekend was really nice.  I cooked gumbo for everybody on Saturday, and I believe it was quite a hit because they all came back Sunday evening to eat the rest. Saturday night after we ate, Joe, Evan, Dana and I went to Broad Ripple Park for a walk.  We walked a bit and then we all swang on the swings, all of us, even the guys!  And then we went to one of the play grounds and played on the gymnastic type equipment.  Then the guys sat on a bench and talked for a while, and Dana and I sat up near one of the slides and talked and sang songs that we used to sing all the time when we were younger.  At one point, I went down one of the slides backwards and Dana came down it right behind me, too quickly for me to get out of the way.  I haven't laughed that much in a really long time.

      I just came back from my lunch break.  I'm reading House of Leaves.  What a trip.  I think that I spend half of the time re-reading everything, but I think that is the point.  I think he's trying to make you think that you've missed something.  Each time I put the book down, when it's time to go back to work or what not, I have the same reaction.  I softly mutter the word crazy.  I'm anxious to read more.  Maybe tonight...  So, I had a very long talk with Evan last night.  We both told each other things that others don't know.  I told him things that even Joe doesn't know, but I know that I can trust him.  He is going through hell right now.  I don't feel like there is much that I can say to him because he is so self-aware and already such a positive person that he just knows everything I could possibly offer.  I guess the thing is right now to just listen.  We can't change the past.  I say it a million times over, but it's true.  We have to mourn over what we may have done or not done to cause a situation because we have to find a way to heal.  But then we just have to move on with our lives.  We can ask ourselves if we have done the best that we could given our circumstances.  Maybe we did, and maybe not.  But take that answer one way or another and learn from it.  Try your best not to make the same mistakes again.  He will be happy again.  He will find a way out of all of this.  I know it.  I already believe that he is an amazing person, and that this will only make that even more true.  I told him some things about Joe, about my feelings, nothing too personal of course.  Before I even really started talking about any doubts I may have had and what not, he asked me where I saw things going with Joe and I.  I said that I think we will probably get married someday.  But the way he asked it... It keeps running through my mind.  It is almost as if he has doubts that that is the way we are headed.  It makes me think that he is unbelievably perceptive.  I don't even know for sure if that is what he was thinking, but there was something in his eyes, when he asked me.  I've always thought from the outside there appears to be absolutely nothing wrong with Joe's and my relationship and that just about everyone would think without a doubt we are headed toward marriage.  Sometimes I feel like my mind goes back and forth, and I'm not completely sure about what I should do.  But I told this to Evan, and it is totally true:  I fully believe that Joe would fight for me and for us and our relationship.  He may not be able to change everything, but I can see that he is totally willing to put forth effort.  You know, I say these things as if I'm perfect.  Lord have mercy, am I so far from that.  I know that there has to be things that Joe puts up with in me that are difficult for him.  I really need to focus on myself and the changes I need to make.  I'm happy, though.  Yesterday was a good day.  Today is a good day.  Everything will be okay.

      "Sunday morning rain is falling Steal some covers share some skin Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable You twist to fit the mold that I am in" --Maroon 5-Sunday Morning  That reminds me of Joe and I on weekends.  Lying in bed for an hour or so after we wake up, enjoying snuggling up with each other. Our bodies just seem to fit together in such a beautiful way while we sleep or doze or snuggle.  It makes me feel so loved and so safe.  I love the way he takes care of me.  He is truly amazing.

      I had a dream about falling last night.  It wasn't your typical falling dream though.  I was riding this dirt bike around this canyon.  The canyon was not the size of the grand canyon. It actually resembled this gulley or valley that is at Brookside Park because it was covered with grass.  But it was much deeper than the one at Brookside Park and the canyon walls were nearly vertical.  So, I was riding this dirt bike.  The edge around the canyon was somewhat curvy and I was riding close to the edge. I was fine for a while but when I got to the other side of the canyon, there was a slight decline and I started picking up speed and barreling right toward the edge of the canyon.  So the next thing you know, I'm riding this dirt bike nearly vertical down this canyon. I was actually having a blast.  But then suddenly my bike was gone and the canyon wall was completely vertical and I was just falling straight down. It was a very long fall, so I was having time to try to figure out keeping myself from dying. I decide that if I position my feet in this specific way then I'll probably be okay.  I catch this glimpse of some weeds growing out of the canyon wall. I grab hold of the weeds just in case, and somehow they end up being the most stable weeds ever.  The weeds slow my fall enough and a few seconds later I hit the ground (with my feet in that specific "lifesaving" position), and I was just fine.  My mom suddenly appears at the top of the canyon and yells down to see if I'm okay.  My heart was beating like crazy but I almost wanted to do it again.  So do you think that is an indication that I need more adventure in my life right now?

      I'm feeling really happy right now.  Though, this weekend I had a spout of being really depressed. I felt like I was invisible to Joe, that we've gotten to a point in our relationship where he sort of takes me for granted. The thing is that I think too much. So I start thinking that things will always be that way, that there is no hope, and that I should just break up with him now to start recovering from my broken heart and move on with my life. I know, I know, I can be a drama queen. So we talked for a little while and I mentioned that maybe he should stay living at the condo and I should live in my apartment alone. And I said that I thought he'd rather live there than with me anyway.  But he told me that I was wrong, that he would rather live with me. He told me that he doesn't think about the things he does as not paying attention to me. He doesn't mean to treat me as if I'm invisible to him; he just starts doing his own thing and...I don't know... forgets about me for a while? Anyway, he told me to just talk to him and point it out when I feel left out. I know that he is right. I know that is what I should do instead going all overboard and thinking that we need to break up.  Just sometimes I think in one extreme to the other. I can't help it. It's just how I am.  Anyway, we worked things out, and we're just fine now. I overreact. I know it. I admit it. But I'm happy for the way that he balances me. So, I'm sooo excited that Ludwig will be here in a week. He's my best friend ever.  When I think about all of the fun times we've had, I can't help but have this huge smile on my face. And we're going to go see Incubus together. I mean, come on, what could be better than that!  On a less positive note, Dana will be leaving like the day after Ludwig leaves to go back to H-town.  Crazy, stupid girl. I wish she wouldn't be going. She drives me insane, but I still love her to death.  She's not going to be happy. But enough of that, I want to focus on the positive because there is just not anything more that I think I can do, short of tying her up and forcing her to stay here, hmmmm...which may not be such a bad idea...:P

      I don't want to think about him so often. I've moved on with my life, and I am happy.  I still think about him though. Too often.  I remember his smile and his laugh. I don't want to remember. Remembering only makes me try to justify him breaking my heart so many times. I've already done that way too much forgiven him, justified his actions; I'm done with it. It only hurt me worse.  I have no desire to be with him. But I still think about him. Why is that? Is my heart and mind once again not in sync? Why can't I wipe him out of my life completely? I want to forget. It doesn't help that I'm still friends with all of his friends.  Everytime I talk to them, it is a constant reminder of how it once was, or how I once wanted it to be always.  I loved the illusion.  The illusion disappeared. Reality destroyed my dreams.  That's okay, though. I learned to deal with it.  I learned to move on. I just don't want to remember anymore.

      I miss having friends.  Okay, so I still have a lot of friends but they are all so far away.  I miss having people I can do things with all of the time. Not just talk to from time to time on the phone or online.  I've never had so much trouble finding friends.  But I guess I've always been in environments conducive to finding a lot of people with similar interests.  When I was in college or working at restaurants or pretty much in any other stage of my life, it was crazy easy to make friends. But now, where I work, I'm like 15 years (at least) younger than everyone.  So there's nobody at work to be really good friends with.  The guys we hang out with are great, and they are my friends, but we rarely have girls hang around, except for Lindsey.  Lindsey is nice enough, but there is some reason that she and I don't hit it off completely. I can never quite put my finger on it.  I did meet a girl during my insurance classes, but I left her number in a pair of jeans which are at my apartment, and I keep forgetting to get the number to call her.  I really should at least give it a chance.  She was in the same situation as me.  Her husband was transferred here; he made a lot of friends easy because of his job; she left all of her good friends back home and she also works in a type of place that doesn't have anyone her age or that enjoys what she enjoys.  So I really need to make the effort.  We could really become good friends.  Bailey and I also have potential to be really good friends, and now that Dana is leaving she will need someone to hang out with too.  Anyways, I miss my friends.  On a happy note, it is only 2 weeks until Ludwig will be here, and we will go to the Incubus concert!!!

       She left last night. Actually early this morning. I want her back. My heart aches for her. She was supposed to call me the first time she stopped. But she didn't. I've called her like 20 times, but she hasn't picked up. Why did I let her go? Why didn't I just wrap my arms around her and force her to stay as I wanted to so badly. If something happens to her, I don't know how I will make it through. She stopped by the condo at 3am. I was half asleep, but I gave her the cookies I made and I hugged her goodbye. I told her how much I love her. It doesn't seem enough. Please let her be okay. Please, please let her be okay. I can't lose her. Help me to be strong. I'm so afraid. Help me to be strong. Oh please, take this pain away.

         I'm going to say it the way it was said to me. Sonja was robbed at gunpoint yesterday. They took her purse and her car, and they robbed the store where she works. They threatened her that they would come after her if she called the police. They tied her up and put a gun to her head. She said all that she could think was that Christian wouldn't have his mommy anymore. I freaked out when Mom told me. I know that physically Sonja is okay, but she has been having emotional problems lately and this has sent her over the edge. My heart goes out to her. I'm just about over the edge myself. There is just so many bad things happening, Dana is planning to go back to Daniel, Maw Maw's health is failing her, and now this. I'm having anxiety attacks lately. I've had maybe four or five of them now. And the latest thing is that, I feel like I can barely breathe not only when I'm having an attack but al      most all of the time. Like I can never quite catch my breath. I'm constantly doing stretches and trying all kinds of things to calm myself down, but I'm at my breaking point. Or at least I feel like I am. I did some research on anxiety attacks and read the symptoms, and that is definitely what is happening to me. Feeling like I can't breathe, extreme changes in temperature, chest pains, a racing pulse, thinking that I'm going crazy or that I'm going to die. Yep, that's exactly how I've been feeling. The thing is, I don't want to go to a doctor. I'm trying to do breathing exercises, and I'm looking for natural treatments. I just don't trust the types of drugs that the doctors give you for this kind of thing. There are too many side effects. I think that I'll be okay. I've never had any problems like this. Even when I was so extremely depressed back when Paul and I broke up and my family wasn't having much to do with me, I was very depressed but I never had anxiety attacks. Now, it is just bad things happening to everybody else. I think it is the fact that I have no control over the bad things happening now. Before, I had control over my life even if I was severely depressed and I looked for a way to fix things. I don't have the power to fix the things that are happening now. It makes me feel so helpless. I thought writing would help me to feel better, but it hasn't. So I'm going to stop now.

      It's Sunday, and it is beautiful. Sunny and gorgeous. I spent most of the day at the pool.  I'm reading a new book.  It's about the friendship of two women.  I'm not that far into it, but I believe that one of the women is eventually going to die of cancer.  It is based on a true story in the life of the author.  It sounds as if it would be really depressing, but instead it is really the opposite, quite upbuilding.  So...I think I may be driving Joe completely crazy this weekend. I've been pretty emotional and down.  I mean Dana is leaving this next week.  I'm so torn about the whole situation.  I want to spend a lot of time with her while I can, but I also feel so depressed over the fact that there is nothing left for me to do to encourage her not to make what I feel is a really wrong decision.  Taking a step back from everything and looking at everyone around me and their reactions to the situation with Dana has been somewhat interesting.  I'm not talking Mom, Dad, or Sonja because technically they're not around me.  They know more of the history than any of my friends here that have opinions on the matter, and therefore they are basically of he same opinion as I am.  I'm not even saying that our family's opinion is the right one, but we've gone through this so much with Dana when they're comes a time when you let her do what she is bound to do anyway because it kills us to keep trying to stop her and watching her make the same mistakes over and over.  So, we're stopping the fight, at least for now, letting her win this battle.  Hopefully, it will not hurt her more but develop her personality into one so strong she will be able to face any challenge in her life.  So I'm talking about Joe's reaction, Evan's reaction, Bailey's reaction, Tyler's reaction, Jay's reaction.  Joe's reaction is somewhat obvious and predictable if you know Joe well. He doesn't deal well with people when he considers that they are acting stupidly.  He considers Dana's actions to be stupid and on top of that he sees the pain that her actions cause for me and my family, and that makes him avoid her when he can.  Evan's reaction.  Actually hard for me to put in words.  I think he realizes that I'm doing the only thing that I can at this point.  I think that he would probably handle things differently if he were in my shoes. How, I'm not sure.  I know he doesn't think that she should leave, but I'm pretty sure that he knows it is inevitable.  Bailey's reaction. Bailey is very sad that Dana is leaving. In the short time that she and Dana have gotten to know each other, they have become very close friends.  I think it breaks Bailey's heart that Dana will be leaving. But she is not discouraging her from doing so, she is pushing away the pain.  She is trying to be a supportive friend, but not knowing the complete situation as those of us within her family do, I don't think she realizes how bad of a decision Dana is making in wanting to go back with Daniel.  Tyler, Bailey's older sister, sent a card to Dana, basically telling Dana to live everyday to it's fullest, to try to make the right decisions in life.  I know that she is trying to give Dana some positive things to think about, even though she is in total disagreement with Dana's choices. I like her, even if Bailey and Dana thinks she can be pushy sometimes.  We're big sisters, we're supposed to be like that.  Even though it may be just by a few years, we do have a bit more life up on our sisters and we just don't want to see them make some of the same mistakes that we've made especially in matters of the heart.  Jay's reaction. Okay...my reaction to Jay's reaction is to tell Jay to shut up.  I like Jay, a lot, a whole lot.  He's a great guy.  He was one of Joe's first friends when we moved to Indy.  He even fed Mr. President for us when we went to H-town for vacation.  He loves his friends.  He really really loves his friends. He loves people, and if he considers you a friend well then he really loves you. When he and Dana went to pick up oil for her car the other day regarding her situation, he told her to "just do it".  If that's what she wants to do, he told her to go for it.  I just feel that he barely knows anything about the situation.  Despite the fact that I think Dana will do exactly what she wants to do, I just don't feel that she needs encouragement.  She doesn't need to have somebody patting her on the back saying, it's just fine that you want to go back to the druggie ex-boyfriend of yours who was abusive and treated you like shit.  Don't worry it's totally fine.  NO, JAY, IT'S NOT FINE, AND SHE DOESN'T NEED TO HEAR THAT IT IS.  I know that I'm emotional over it, but I just don't think that she needs to hear that what she is doing is okay.  And yesterday, he asked if we are having a going-away party for her.  I didn't say a word but of course my thinking was "why in the world would we want to celebrate her bad decision?"  I would feel like I'm telling her that I support what she is doing, and I don't want to do that at all.  But obviously, what I was thinking was evident in my face because Jay said "Karoline, don't give me that look.  I just want to be involved if we're going to do something special for her before she goes."  It made me feel as if I'm the evil older sister who doesn't want to do anything nice for her younger sister.  It's not that way. I love her.  I still love her so much.  Nothing will ever change that. I just think that at this point in her life she is making really bad choices.  I don't know maybe we should show her just how much we care and how much we are willing to do for her, so that maybe she'll realize sooner rather than later that she's made a big mistake and she'll find a way to come back here to people who really care about her.  Would that be the better way to act? I don't know anymore.  I'm completely drained. I don't know the best thing for me to do. I just don't know.  Ah, my sweet little Dana...your heart is just too soft my little one.
