      One word: Tired.  Woke up at 5.30am, so that I could pick up Dad from the car workshop before work.   Picked up Dad and missed a turning. So Dad told me to take a U-Turn to go to Taman Tun instead - and we both forgot that the lanes were blocked! We headed back to where we started off earlier, and finally got on the right track.  That wasn't as tiring as listening to Dad say in his panicky tone "I thought you knew the road" etc.   If he saw this, he would have denied it outright. "I wasn't panicking!"  Yeah right. :)

      Had another dream with my Ex in it. It was similar to all other dreams I had of him ever since the breakup, but this time it was different - I didn't cry, nor feel sad or upset.   I dreamt that I had a fever but had to go somewhere, and he volunteered to accompany me there. As we walked toward my destination, we held hands and talked - I felt happier than ever before. Upon reaching my destination, we hugged and kissed goodbye - it felt like time stopped at that moment.   I woke up feeling very calm and full of acceptance - that was the most liberating experience I've ever had. And I realised that I have forgiven him and myself.   People always sing "forgive and forget", but I will  never  forget the valuable lessons I've learned from this "relationship":- 1) Never to recklessly throw my love into a one-sided love affair, but award it to one who truly deserves it. 2) Stay away from super-negative guys who degrade my family & friends (and his as well), who can and will eventually pull me down and destroy my self-esteem and self-worth. 3) My closest and truest friends are the real treasures Life has given to me.  4) Real love is never one-sided but is appreciative of one another, grows together and changes for the better. 5) Sweet promises can always be conjured out of thin air...it is only when the crunch comes that one can see what the person making those promises really is made of. 6) Love is never about blame nor staying with me out of guilt.  As Nancy Reagan once said, "A woman is like a teabag - only in hot water do you realize how strong she is".

      Upon waking up this morning, I discovered the following:-  1) I have no more tears to cry - my eyes are totally dry. 2) My skin looks weathered from all the air-conditioned air at work (time to slather more body lotion and drink more water!) 3) My face could scare the undead back into their eternal resting place(s), or even motivate them to reincarnate faster.  I feel so tired.

      The previous skin was too gloomy for me, and this new skin provides a refreshing change (those with sore eyes, beware! :p).  Did a lot of nothings today. Had fun playing a board game with Sis -its been a long time since we did that, compared to us sinking into our sofa and flipping through TV channels. :)  Just visited my online "family" (  http://ptfpp.com  )...thank goodness Darlie is ok and is on the mend - whew! The past month has been a series of mishaps, troubles & etc for us all. But things are beginning to look like they are turning out for the better. *crosses fingers, toes, eyes and nose for luck*

      Yesterday was super! ^_^  Met up with my college friends whom I've lost contact for 2 years (gosh, has it been that long?). Just a bunch of us girls - it was fun and rejuvenating, to say the least. No unpleasant or unwanted people in the picture. :o) Too bad Joyce couldn't make it.  We chatted and laughed about the "good old days" (like we were grannies or something. Lol) and did a lot of catching up. Felt like we didn't have enough time and made a promise to meet up again soon. How soon though, is another question. Hee hee.  Ended up collecting calling cards again. Gatherings are getting too business-like these days. :p  Joined Sis & Debs to shop for J's birthday present. Nearly walked the entire shopping complex twice! After much pondering, hem-ing and haw-ing, we decided on something unorthodox which will (hopefully) calm J's nervous energy and refresh him (no, its not Tongkat Ali or anything of that kind. :p) - an mini aromatherapy kit! Hope he likes it and can use it (after accounting for that nose of his...aighs). Oh, and we got a cute pair of chopsticks which had his name painted on it. The key word here is...Cute.  Made it back in time with Debs to freshen up before heading to J's place early evening...and as usual, we were the first guests. It never fails...no matter how much time we take or how late we move out from home to go to J's place, we will always be the first to arrive. Too bad we don't get prizes for being punctual. Lol.  Played with J's sis' dog - very the friendly and playful. He kept bounding towards and crashing into J's guests (especially those holding up plates of food.... He should meet Adik and Bubbles... hee hee hee) and strolled around to be petted by almost everyone present (boy was he in doggy heaven!). I say almost, because Debs nearly hit the ceiling when he bounded towared her. Can't blame her really, she just recovered from a bad asthma attack.  Did more catching up with the BC gang (well, most of them anyways) and got the official "bomb" from Rach and her fiancee. And the expected friendly arguement ensued amongst the BC gang on the time and location of the wedding reception and dinner venues (Funny they didn't argue about The Proper Attire this time). *grins*  And where was the Birthday Boy? Running around like a Lemming with its tail ablaze, trying to ensure that the whole party was running smoothly. Which all of us thought absolutely unneccesary, considering the fact that there were already caterers and his family present. :p The highlight of the evening for me was when our 2 elusive and extremely busy members actually turned up - CSKK and SCDD! n_n  After singing "Happy Birthday" and the cutting of the birthday cake, a group of J's friends floated paper lotus flowers (made from squares of paper on which everyone wrote their wishes for J) in his swimming pool - a cute and thoughtful gesture on their part, me thinks. Unfortunately, the candles burned the paper petals faster than they could light them up.  It was a great day and night - I've never felt so happy and relaxed in such a long time. n_n

      What the hell was I moping around for?  I have my life and sanity back, and that is more precious to me than anything in the world. The Ex can go grieve by looking for another, for all I care.  Can't wait for tomorrow's reunion thingy...hope that my other Oz friends can make it then... we have so much to catch up on! :)

      I still can't believe it.   After his saying that he would be happy only with me, and that he would change for the better (ie no smokes, cut down on the drinking & gambling) to be with me and that he would talk to my parents etc, he probably forgot about those promises. And to ice the cake, it finally came out from the mouth of the babes that I never kept my promises and it was always about ME.    After I fought with my family to be with him.  After I lied and hid the fact that we were still together, from my family and most of my friends to be with him.  After I endured scoldings of 3 to 5 hours a session, was called "cheap" & "slut" and got slapped across the face by my mother because I stayed with him.  After I gave him what he wanted.  After I loved him with every ounce of my soul.  And I had to  ask  him for things that most girls take for granted of their boyfriends, like celebrating Valentine's Day, and chocolate that is not the brand and type that he likes (and him thinking that I like the same - for 2 whole years, despite my telling him otherwise. Many times.).  After I endured his put downs about my grammer and spelling (when he can't even tell that there is only one way to spell his favourite word "hurt"), my friends & family.  After I took the trouble to learn up things about his interests and hobbies.  After the 2 years of listening to him complain about everything under the sun.  After the words, things & cards I gave him to help him feel better about himself.  After I listened to his grouses about work, cared about his self-esteem when it invovled his workplace, and encouraged him to leave for a better workplace,  and help look out for jobs for him (even my close friend and her hubby helped out here) - and guess what? He decided to stay put in that hell hole after all. Ha ha ha.  After I decided that if it makes him feel better about the breakup, we could remain friends but only after some time. And he blasted back that it was always about me me me me me me me me me, and that I should leave him alone and let him grieve in peace.   So much for being happy only when he is with me.

      Woke up this morning feeling like I just came out from a dumpster...my body ached like crazy and my head was spinning.   Went to the clinic before work. The doctor told me that my blood pressure and tempreature was normal, and I was slightly dehydrated. Was given MC for the day, and a lecture on proper rest and drinking real fruit juices. :p  Spent the day sleeping like a pig, drinking fruit juices and feeling extremely bored & restless. I need to do something before I go nuts!  Thank god for work tommorrow.

      A friend of mine recently told me of an upcoming informal Reunion. Having mixed feelings on whether I should go or not.  On one hand, there are people I genuinely would like to meet again and on the other, there might be those I don't want to meet, attending.  What the hey, I'll go anyway.   I'll live another day.

      One of my close friend's birthday party is at the end of this week. And the question that we (his friends) ask ourselves every year rears its ugly head again.... What can you get for a guy who can afford almost anything he desires and probably already has whatever it is? Argh argh argh... headache!  J's reply will always be the same - no need for presents, just bring yourselves. I've a good mind to find a single and available hot gal, wrap her up and present her to him. And that would solve our Present woes for the next few years. Lol. But seriously, I don't think that would work. Oh well, another cornball idea down the drain.  Or I could just make him a birthday card..that's an idea! *pats myself on the back* :p   Talking of J's birthday present just reminded me of Rach's wedding next month - no present yet either. Whattogetwhattogetwhattoget.... don't want to give her another tea set/rice cooker/pots & pans/iron etc etc.  Panic! Walk in circles at top speed! Jump up and down like a chimpanzee!!

      Happy Belated Father's Day!  Celebrated FD yesterday - sis and I dragged the whole family out for lunch at Mr Ho's Fine Foods, coz Dad just loves eating pork knuckles (that are high in cholesterol and sodium. Bad for his health, but what the hey its only once in a while).  The whole shebag was nearly ruined by the King of the Day when he kept pestering everyone on where we were going for lunch, and "reminding" us (in front of Mum, mind you) that we didn't celebrate Mother's Day on an equal scale. Grr.. grr.. :p  Little did he know that we included that in our plans already. Lol.  In the end, it was worth the planning and panicking. The family enjoyed the meal (which was on the salty side...maybe the pigs were sailor pigs and Old Salts. Lol) and Mum loved the surprise Belated Mother's Day roses. ^_^ Everyone relaxed after that. Whew!  Window shopped after that and got myself a brand new pair of sneakers - which I was supposed to get 3 years ago. :p Talk about procastination! Hee hee.

      I cannot believe how fast this week flew past me. Blink my weary eyes...and its Saturday already? I would cheer and jump for joy if not for my tired self. Too bad I can't meet Sandman in person, or I'd congratulate him on giving me such long and restful slumber. Lol.  This morning feels surreal. The cool morning breeze carressed my skin while I was out in the garden, and in my mind's eye I was transported to a time when my garden was just a forest, way before it was mowed over and converted to a oil palm plantation. I saw mist enshrouded greenery and could smell the dewy dampness of the morning mixed with the smell of rot coming from fallen tree trunks, and the musty &/or musky smell of sleeping jungle dwellers.   Hmm...sure signs that I'm going to have a fever or the 'flu soon.

      When something you cherish dies, what do you do? Mourn your loss, or go stark raving mad? Cry buckets of tears when you think no one is looking, until you resemble a deranged panda that just escaped from a petting zoo? Start pointing fingers? What?  The loss I've experienced recently is the most painful for me in my so far life. It takes two to tango, and it takes the same number to make or break a relationship. There will be plenty who will say that I initiated that loss - but for me, it began long before that. That frustrated look, the sweet promises I knew wouldn't happen, the angry words, the this-is-more-than-I-can-handle tone of voice.   Looking back, I realise that I have no one to blame but myself. I knew that it wouldn't work out in the end, despite the repeated promises of him "changing for the better" to be with me. I knew that he wouldn't be happy for long, despite him saying otherwise - and I selfishly chose to stick to him.  I should have just broken his heart in the initial stages (and when both of us could better handle the loss then) and let him find his own happiness elsewhere, rather than have both hearts rolled over with razor-sharp spikes now.  At this juncture, I don't care about what he did or didn't do anymore. That will be exclusively his to decide.

      There are times when I fantasise about being rich & famous [everyone indulges in that fantasy once in a while, don't they? ;)] and everything seems Happy Happy Joy Joy. But I do know that they are only fluffy thoughts - I know I won't be happy being both if I don't have my family, friends and a steady mind.  That doesn't mean I shun things dear. There are the finer things in Life that I have learned to appreciate through my family and friends. And then there are the modest things that give me the most joy - friendship, love, laughter and trust.  Right now my brain feel absolutely disconnected from my body, and the flow of my thoughts are really erratic.   Hence the topic jumping.

      Its funny how things turn out the way you never dreamed it would. The persons you thought would be with you forever, leaves you. The things you never expect to happen do.  The sudden passing of my favourite lecturer on 07 June 2004 was a shock to say the very least. She was the kind of person whom everyone assumed would be around forever, and looked the part too.  I had a picture in my mind that my children (natural or adopted) would be studying under her and when they come home, they will complain to me that she is too strict for anyone's good.  And I would smile and say "Ms Woo, too strict? Nah... she's a good person once you know her".  For anyone who knew her, please pen in your thoughts for her family to remember her by at http://cywoo_tribute.blogspot.com

      Talked to my Ex one last time yesterday, when I was feeling low. He told me that he had forgiven me. BUT He still brought the past into the conversation. And kept saying that I was mean to him, but he tolerated my behaviour all this while. Felt worse after talking to him (as always).  Hah! If he wants to keep playing the victim of Life, he can do so alone. I am responsible for myself and my actions! He can keep blaming me for all eternity for all I care.  This is my last entry for this blog. Thank you blogger.com for this spot - it has helped healed me and find myself again.

      Hahahahaha, I thought things over and I realised another thing. It's not only my Ex who has an Ego. I have one too, and its much bigger than his.  Or else I wouldn't be jealous of his larger social circle. Or be afraid that he met many more smarter and attractive ladies - let's face the music here...there ARE many other ladies who fill that criteria. Or keep blaming him for my stupid actions. Or keep fearing that what happened to his friends' relationships would happen to us. It did alright, when I let my ego and emotions take over my head.  It's so ridiculous, its not even funny at all. :(

      Smsed my Ex earlier in the morning - at first I felt happy and calm. When I asked him how did he manage to overcome the hurt, he said that he remembered how he was treated.  That was another uncalled slap in the face for me. Just like when he said he wouldn't be happy with me, and that he didn't know that our relationship would turn into a mess. Ha ha, I'm so dumb to even still long for him.  Fiz said that he is just my bad habit, to be removed from my life. And I agree with her.  I gotta pick myself up up up up up up up up up up up!

      Was at my lowest yesterday. Kept thinking that perhaps the breakup was all my fault and started to believe it too. Ended up sms-ing my Ex, and he called me and said otherwise - he admitted that he made me unhappy as well. What do you think about that? Sms-ed him several times after that...asking a myraid of silly questions, which I already know the answers to. Decided to stop it this morning - I'm being unfair to him. Thought it over and over...I can't be friends with him at all, because I love him too much and we might end up at Square One again.  I HAVE to forget him, and MUST NOT wallow in self-pity anymore. Life is much greater than one small misery.   Now if you'll excuse me, I've a life to reclaim.

      I woke up this morning feeling that I've lost my purpose in Life.   I no longer plan my day, nor plan for my future. My once burning desire to own a home, a car, and a gaggle of kids (adopted, mind you) are no longer deeply entrenched.  This is most probably due to my own doing, for having other dreams that involved my Ex - marrying him, having kids with him, living happily as a family. *wry grin*  I still want my own home, my own car and my own adopted kids though. :p

      Mum once told me that she wanted the Old me back.   I have tried to bring her back Mum, and she doesn't  want  to come back. There is no way I will revert to the people-pleasing, self-destructing, too-obliging girl I once was. What is the point in doing that when in the end, your own family members don't even appreciate you, and only remember the "bad" things you do?  Where is the point in that?

      Dear Ex,  I've always wanted to sing a lovely song to you...it's one of those silly little things I do for those I love. But that doesn't suit the current situation, does it? So here's a number written by Shania Twain & R.J. Lange, called "It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing", just for you.   Hope life's been good to you since you've been gone I'm doin' fine now - I've finally moved on It's not so bad - I'm not that sad  I'm not surprised just how well I've survived I'm over the worst,and I feel so alive I can't complain - I'm free again  And it only hurts when I'm breathing My heart only breaks when its beating My dreams only die when I'm dreaming  So, I hold my breath - to forget  Don't think I'm lyin' 'round cryin' at night There's no need to worry,I'm really alright I've never looked back - as a matter of fact  And it only hurts when I'm breathing My heart only breaks when its beating  My dreams only die when I'm dreaming So I hold my breath to forget  It only hurts when I breathe  Mmm,no, I've never looked back - as a matter of fact  And it only hurts when I'm breathing My heart only breaks when its beating My dreams only die when I'm dreaming So, I hold my breath - to forget  Hurts when I'm breathing Breaks when its beating Die when I'm dreaming It only hurts when I breathe

      Had lunch with Dad, Sis and Ms L yesterday - it was fun and a happy moment...wished Mum was with us during lunch though. Bro called halfway through lunch - he just woke up and couldn't find Mum anywhere in the house (Dad had earlier sent Mum to 1U so that she could shop for stuff). Throughout lunch, Dad and Ms L exchanged anecdotes about bringing up children, while Sis & I teased Dad. *grins*   Whilst sitting with them, I zoned out for a second and thought " Now this is a memory worth keeping ". :o)

      Woke up this morning feeling that I could take on any challenge thrown at me...I have changed and the Family has changed. Or is it just due to viewing myself differently from how I did in the past? *shrugs*  My new colleague Jeff, is great! He's easy to talk with, cooperative, humble, helpful and most of all... he is one example of how I would like to be. *grins* His girlfriend must be so proud of him. n_n I'm so happy to have my partner at work now...at least we can brainstorm (2 heads are better than one lonesome one, don't you think? *winks*)to tidy up the department's filing system (our major headache right now). I've done about 50% of it before he arrived and was at a loss on how to file the others. But now, we can work it out...hooray!   Had dinner with Syl last night. Just the two of us - it was very relaxing and enjoyable! :) We talked about houses, cars, compared notes on our working lives, etc etc. n_n After dinner, Syl insisted that Matt (her hubby) drive me to my car, which incidently was parked 10 feet away from where we were standing. I declined and she put her foot down and said it was getting DARK. Meekly, I followed her to their waiting car, and Aaron (their 1 year-plus old son) was behind the wheel! He made a fuss when Matt tried to move him to the back of the car... he wanted to chauffer us all back home! Lol. He's such an adorable kid...you can't help but be happy when you are with him. :D   Oops.. gotta go, it's 8am already. Time to start work! n_n

      Woke up feeling fine. Then my mood soured after breakfast. Grrh.  The weekend passed in a blur of sleep, sleep and more sleep. Class was good... the lecturer is friendly and explained finance concepts quite well at each level (there was one practicing lawyer who wasn't trained in finance, and he explained them to her until she understood! Now that's what I call a  real  teacher). It was quite tiring... I nodded off once during class! I expect I will adapt to my classes' times soon. :)  Went with Dad to the Kepong Koi Farm yesterday morning... whoo! The Koi there are beautiful and HUGE! Had a great time sitting on the chairs provided and just watching the Koi swim around their ponds. ^_^

      Class tonight! ^_^  Boy, I hope that drug-addict cum beggar (Sis confirmed that fact after I related that incident to her - she saw him taking his fixes while she was posted in KL city) at the Masjid Jamek LRT station won't hurl abuses at passers by again. The other night after my class, he was shouting at people for not throwing money into his hands:-    OI!  Ini orang India duduk kat Stesyen LRT Masjid Jamek tiap-tiap hari nak duit! Ini orang tak ada kerja. Bagi duit pada dia!  Oi kamu semua BUTA ka?     Seriously, if a guy who sounds  that  sane and speaks that fluenty in Bahasa Malaysia - he could get a job, turn over a new leaf, etc etc. What sort of cracked up mind thinks that society owes something him, when it is him who is owing a lot to society? What sort of mind thinks that those in the rat race have so much money to spare to fund his disgusting habit? Me thinks he is just plain lazy and blames everyone but himself for everything that goes wrong in his life. What a pitiful way to exist in the world.   Right now all I can think about is food...haven't had any yet this morning. :p Going off to have brekker with my colleagues. ^_^

      Yesterday was quite hectic. Left the office at 5pm to catch the LRT, and made it to class with time to spare. :o)   The class was great - only about 20 of us in it, and we get to hog a table each. :) Some of my classmates KO-ed at their places during break time and couldn't wake up when our class resumed! By the time class was over, I was so bushed, I totally forgot to bring my umbrella back with me! I only realised my mistake when I reached my car. :p  Reached home safely (boy was it dark...I've forgotten what night time driving is like) at 10.30pm and had my dinner consisting of chicken and potato curry - Yum!  11 suspects have already been remanded by the police in connection with the murder of the 23 year old guy in Sri Hartamas. I believe that they will get whats coming to them very soon. I still feel disgusted thinking about the way he died, when he could be still living.

      Whee! Will be attending my first class of the semester this evening at College S - can't  wait  for it to start. I'll be leaving work at 5pm today, thanks to my boss' approval on changing my working time to 8am to 6pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and 9am to 5pm on class nights. I've said it before and I'll say it again... I feel so lucky to have this boss! n_n  Hopefully, my 2 classes this semester won't dissapoint like my previous classes in College B. Owels, just forge ahead and hope for the best.  This morning's headlines were quite disturbing - on Monday morning (3.30am) a 23 year old was beaten a gang of youths when he confronted them either for making fun of him courting his fiancee or for whistling at his fiancee (can't tell which is correct - the 2 newspapers I read gave different accounts). After they fled, the guy was sent to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead on arrival. May his soul rest in peace. His poor fiancee had to watch him being attacked and die. It sickens me right down to the pit of my stomach. The police classified the case as murder and have already arrested some people (whether they are the right ones remains to be seen. I hope they are the right ones).

      Decided on several things yesterday:-  1) To get hitched up by 30 years of age. Otherwise, I'm fine being single. 2) To learn as much as possible in all my jobs, so that I can grow as a person. 3) To listen more, evaluate wisely and regularly stick to my decisions. 4) To avoid people who blame others for their own shortcomings. And not to blame others for my own shortcomings. 5) To do things I am comfortable with, instead of what people expect me to. 6) Be happy being myself and stop trying to convert myself to please anyone.  I could use some alone time right now.

      Had the strangest dream this morning... I was pregnant and admitted myself to a hospital and had the knowledge that I had no husband/boyfriend with me. Delivered a baby girl with no problems or labour pains etc etc. Was discharged the next day and then found out that I was pregnant with a boy! Extremely wierd, but I hope my dream will have something to do with good exam results. *crosses fingers for luck*  Woke up at 7am to Dad knocking on my door...our electricity supply was down.  Bro didn't want to go for his practice sessions, and was in an extremely cranky mood yesterday. Wonder what's bothering him? He didn't want to talk about it either. Mum said is was nothing to do with his exams and not to bother him. *puzzled*

      And now, the time has come for me to nudge Bro out of his slumber...by annoying the heck out of him! *grins*  Today I wil be coaching him on his parking and driving skills...he has been out of practice lately. Hope he can regain his confidence to drive on the road again...it was quite shaken after he was side-swiped by another car whilst sending his sick friend home. Thankfully neither he nor his friend was hurt in that incident, and the damage to his friend's car was minimal. Whew!

      Went to the Times sales with Mark yesterday...the moment I stepped in the place, I was in Heaven! Books at lowered prices! The busy rings of the cash registers! The smell of NEW books (and the complimentary films of dust)! :D  Got the Chicken Soup Series books for Dad, Mum, Sis & Bro (1 each). :p And for myself, David Goleman's  Emotional Intelligence  & Dale Carnegie's  How to Make Friends and Influence People . Mark snorted when he saw the 2 books...he said that I was adding it to my secret HR arsenal to influence &/or control people and to perform my evil HR deeds! Really, that guy can be so delusional sometimes. *grins*  Headed to a SS2 coffeeshop for Mark's lunch (I had my lunch before going out) and met C (our ex-classmate) hanging out with his girlfriend and their friends. She looked sweet, prim & proper (the way that I recently decided not to be anymore)...but me thinks her demeanour suits her. ;) C was pretty good...he sounded more sure of himself. But at the same time, he was avoiding saying "Hi" to me. Perhaps I didn't smile broadly enough? Lol.  After the lunch, we set off to the DVD shop in search for entertainment (more money out of the wallet/purse! Lol). Got  Legally Blonde , which I wanted to watch when it came out but I was too busy then. :p At the same time, Sis called - she just finished her work for the day. We decided to meet up at Mark's place - where the 3 of us proceeded to watch the movie (I've forgotten the title) he just bought. The mystery and suspense was good during the entire movie, but the mood was totally destroyed when the badly coordinated fight scene came into the picture. And the ending? Bah, humbug! Too cliched for our taste.  The evening saw us having a steamboat dinner in Manjalara with the family. It was nice, with the exception of the  Si Tau Poh  shouting (near our table) instructions to her employees...boy, was her voice loud! But then again, I guess that's how it is when you have to work in a relatively noisy environment.  Watched  Bruce Almighty   with Sis before retiring to bed. Went to bed wishing that things with my Ex had that same happy ending as the movie. To my suprise, I leaked some tears. And to think that I thought I ran out of tears to cry already.   Definitely fluffy thoughts at work again.

      Yesterday was a scream.  The EEE had a poor turnout - only a sprinkling of people from each floor participated, while the others ran off beyond the blue lagoon. At 3pm sharp, we marched (talking, always talking) from our respective floors down the narrow and claustrophobia-inducing fire escape when the fire and emergency alarms sounded (Sis reported later that her entire floor could not hear the alarms at all - so her entire floor went down and waited at the lift lobby before the alarms went off. :p).  It was extremely hot outside then - it didn't help that I still had my jacket on (suprisingly, I didn't sweat buckets). We started off to the assembly area (the open-air car park opposite Fajar) and were herded to a spot under some trees (which gave us miserly shade) near an extremely smelly dumpster. My colleagues joked that if we didn't die from the "fire" just now, we are dying from the horrid pong now. :p   Of the 20-something persons working on my floor, only 7 (including yours truly) were present. Being the appointed Assembly Warden, My colleague D reported (in her own words) the following:- 1) The Royal side of the office were so glad that they were alive and well, they went home to celebrate, but will be back at the office later. 2) Some from the Commoner 1 side were happy to find that they escaped from the "fire" unscathed, they went off for some shopping, while those who were so relieved that they were still alive went off for some drinks nearby. 3) The Commoner 2 side were all very happy that they are alive and are now having a near-death experience from inhaling the noxious fumes coming out of the dumpster. D is  such  a funny woman. Lol.  While we were assembled there, two representatives from the Fire Department gave us a speech on safe evacuation practices - or so I heard from Sis later...I couldn't hear anything from my side of the parking lot -  everyone  was talking!.  The man was mumbling into the megaphone to address over 100 extremely hot and bothered participants, for goodness sake! When he finally finished, everyone cheered, clapped and whistled. My colleagues and I then adjourned to the restaurant where our other colleagues were having their drinks...and they laughed at our exploits. Hee hee. :) The cold drinks were a welcome respite from the sweltering heat. Whew!  In the evening, Sis and I rushed to 1 Utama to catch Spidey 2 at 7pm. Before entering the cineplex, my ravenous stomach obstinately decided that it was  very  hungry, and wanted hotdog with fries and lots of ketchup and english mustard! Ended up munching the food before 100-odd pairs of eyes, but I didn't care. *grins*  Many of Sis' colleagues monopolised the cinema theatre...too many of them whom I don't recognise. Once we were seated, a member of the organising committee of the Sports Club kept snapping pictures of everyone present "for the album". Boy, was the flash emitting from that small digital camera bright - if you were stranded on a deserted island, it could come handy as a distress signal. :p  When the lights dimmed, we were treated to the usual draggy half-hour of advertisements, which incidently did not motivate me to purchase any of the products adverstised. Ho ho ho. :p  But the wait was worth our while... Spidey 2 was great! n_n  Dr. Octavious makes a more convincing super-villan than the Green Goblin ever did. :D But Spidey was unmasked too many times during the entire show... reminds me of one of the original Star Trek TV episodes "The Man with the 1,001 Faces" - after much unmasking and startled gasps, the viewer gets extremely tired. Help! Shock ensues after the unmasking of Spidey...but his identity will always be forgotten within 2 seconds the most, because the person who unmasked Spidey would be distracted by Dr. Octavious. Thanks, Octo-boy. Lol.  I have never seen Aunt May in any attire besides her dresses (in the comic, she is always wearing her trademark purple dress. :p)...in one scene in the movie, she sports a checked-shirt and jeans! :p But her character here has more spunk than in the comics...she actually whacked Dr Octavious on the head with her brolly while he was holding her hostage! Whoa!  JJ Jameson was also great - he had more impact as the lovable calculating anti-Spidey that he is in this movie as compared to the first. :) And the ending was perfect - they even included MJ's trademark "Go get 'em, Tiger". *grins*  After the movie ended, Sis and I went hunting for our dinner. That itself was quite funny - with only half an hour left to closing time, Sis kept changing her mind on what she wanted to eat! We ended up zipping from one place to another until she decided on Nando's. :D  The tired line of "And our exhausting day ended on a happy note" is quite appropriate here. ;)

      Felt low and cranky this morning. Left home a little miffed, because I was told off for something I didn't do. :(  Oh well...another day in the making, another day to live. :p  This afternoon will see my colleagues & I participating in an Emergency Evacuation Exercise (EEE in short. :p), conducted by the Building Management. Basically, we are to take the fire escape from our floor to the ground floor (In an orderly fashion - I hope everyone else follows instructions accurately...this thing is serious!) then make our way to the nearest open-air parking lot. This is going to be fun and chaotic and the same time. Lol.  Sis is taking me to watch Spidey 2 this evening, with the tickets she got through her Company's Sports Club. According to Sis, she practically fought to get them - each member is entitled to two, but someone took one of her tickets! And she kept telling her colleagues the only reason why she wanted the tickets was because I wanted to watch it. Awwww, how sweet of her. n_n    Will write more about the EEE and Spidey 2 tommorrow, if I can conquer our home PC for half an hour before Bro does....he has been monopolising it since his hols started 3 weeks back. :p

      I absolutely NEED to get my hands on some acrylic wool right now! Feel really bored just watching the shoot-shoot-lurve-lurve shows on Wah Li Tai every night. :p  On the bright side, my classes will be starting next week. My boss has approved for me to leave work an hour early on class nights so that I can reach my class on time. I feel so lucky to have a great boss! n_n

      Woke up as early as I could this morning and left home at 7.15am, in the hopes of avoding the jam from the change from fastrack to smartag lanes today. I was wrong about beating the jam. Got stuck in it - most were as momentarily confused as I was as to where their "right" lanes were. As it turns out, there were 3 Touch 'n Go lanes (but only 2 open), and one ( SATU sahaja ) Smartag lane (they were still slowly putting up the other Smartag lane...grr.)   And this helps to smoothen the traffic?   Hopefully, things will pan out and it'll be business as usual soon.
