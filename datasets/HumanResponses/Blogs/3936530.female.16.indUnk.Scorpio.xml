      Today we continued on with our medium term measurements...we have half done...so we hope to be done in a week or so (that should free up our schedule, so we can concentrate on reproducibility and accuracy measurements.  Medium Term is just so time consuming.  Dave talked to us about covariance calculations to add to the already massive spreadsheet....I hope that I understand the theory when we actually attempt to put it into the spreadsheet.

      Today we went to Kodak on an adventurous field trip....it was kinda cool to learn all about the real world application of Imaging Science....The fact that we got to see all the new technologies and such aided in my understanding of imaging science and it's value in the world...I thought it was pretty darn cool to see stuff that most ppl will probably never be able to see because they won't live to see it's entrance into the world.

      Although we seemingly didn't accomplish a whole lot...we are exhausted...coming in at 8 and leaving at 5 tends to wear you out...even when you don't do anything...and it isn't that we don't have things to do...just that we don't have enough time to do it all...

      Because of our labs and various tours we lost time that we needed to do medium term repeatability measurements...but we'll still be able to complete the task at hand if we do three term measurements a week for the next couple weeks...I guess you could say I learned how to manage my time today...

      Today was the beginning of our third week...we have been doing pretty much the same thing in repetition...so not too much was learned on my part...but we have perfected our time for our long term repeatability measurements...about 40 minutes for 48 measurements...not too shabby...if both of us got here at the same time we could posssibly finish before our 8:45 morning meeting.

      After our morning meeting we quickly took all of our long-term repeatability measurements for the morning so that we could attend a  FREE  pizza lunch over in the fish bowl...only to be accomponied be the most entertaining movie on color science and spectrophotometers!! (sadly enough the video kinda made sense and I kind of leraned more from the video than I have in the past week...but I still fell asleep during the second half of the second movie!! (shh...it's a secret)...like you weren't asleep too!!  When we got back to 18 we worked on our reproducibility measurents for Minolta and SF600...then we ended the day with some ping pong...

      We spent the majority of our morning taking long term repeatability measurements in order to attend the 8:45 A.M. meeting and the Labs over at 76...although we were late for both.  We then did the lab...which was much more stressful than one would have hoped...as we were unsure of the happenings of the other interns we weren't able to go to lunch with them at the China Buffet...in fact we have been unable to eat lunch with them since the 6th...we were able to play ping pong for a little while though!!

      We attempted to follow the schedule that we had set up for ourselves...I'm pretty sure that the only thing we stuck to was our lunch time...today was PIZZA DAY!!!...apparently the $.60/slice pizza is free for your first time...so I took 3!! lol...other than that I learned that life-savers are called life-savers because the guy that invented them had a friend that died choking on a hard candy...so in order to prevent more hard candy deaths he made a candy with a whole in it so that one is able to breathe even if one swallows the candy whole and it gets lunged in one's throat for all of eternity...

      Today was a day of our medium term repeatability measurements (yeah they are about as interesting as they sound)...these are measurements that need to be taken once a minute for 10 minutes for each the calibration tile and the PTFE every hour on the hour...needless to say we had a lot of free time in between measurements...NAP TIME!!!

      We spent a "fair" amount of time at the Library learning how to research a database and catalog...and from what I gathered we were supposed to be able to reiterate the difference between a database and a catalog...(maybe I went to the bathroom for that part...did anyone else actual pay attention to that "segment" of her presentation...or were you all doing the same thing as me-->doing your own little research project??  By the time we got back from Java Wally's and I finished me Hazelnut Steamer we had just enough time to finish our precision measurements ( 50 measurements of each machine's calibration tile and the PTFE) for each machine...it was finally time to have a sit down meeting with Dave and discuss the agenda for the rest of our summer at RIT...WOO HOO!!

      So...today was our first real day of work, alhtough I wouldn't really call it work..it was more or less glorified "orientation."  We had the opportunity to explore all the spectrophotometers that we had learned about yesterday...that was fun...almost took up an hour of our day.  Anyways our day progressed and we finally realized that we were going to be doing a ton of measurements after our meeting with Dave Wyble.  For the rest of the day we took a series of 50 measurements on the first few of all 12 spectrophotmeters.  Fun Stuff!!
