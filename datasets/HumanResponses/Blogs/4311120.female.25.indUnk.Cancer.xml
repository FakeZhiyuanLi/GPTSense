      45 minutes to go till the end of my shift. Cant wait to go home and unpack some more stuff.  We found someone to move in and share our house with today. She's lovely and I hope she likes the house as much as we do.  We were thinking of getting someone for the furnished third bedroom and I put a advert up at the local university. The first, and only response so far was from this total idiot. I will copy my advert and then the email conversation between myself and the idiot below it.   ROOM AVAILABLE Single room in extremely sunny house is available. Room is furnished with dresser, bed and wardrobe. Room would suit a mature, independent person. Room is in a lovely furnished, spacious home with a deck, 2 living areas, back yard and lots of Sun. $120 including: phone rental, power, gas and basics such as dishwashing liquid etc. (Toll calls excluded.) Close to public transport and shopping centre. Separate food and shared cleaning duties are required. Avail now! Please call Anna on........    A few days later a received a email saying the below:       Strangers email:   ring me up I need accom im in barts           My response:  Give me your details and a description of what your looking for and we will get back to you           Idiot says:  2nd yaer arts major phil eng and vegetarian and male 28 no hang ups or prefnerences accom at premium so dont mind room details also need social life (funny arts)       My response:  When are you looking to move? We are both meat eaters but as we wouldn't be sharing food we wouldn't have a problem unless you did? We are just moving in so we were thinking of having people through next week sometime. Would you be available?       idiot says:  yes, is there anywhere to park my car around there!!!! I just got it towed away!!!!!       My response:  Yes, there are car parks available outside on the street. My partner has a vehicle which we park on the street and we find it very safe.  We have had a few people come through and have a look so it would be a good idea if you are interested to come have a look in the next 2 afternoons before we make a decision.  Today or tomorrow between 4:30 and 6:30 is best for us. Email me back with a time if you can make it.        idiot says:   alright then where do I go, how about 3?        My response:  No, that's not good for us because we will be at work. Can you make a time between 4:30 - 6:30 possibly like I originally said.      I give up, I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but this guy is just a totally twit and obviously have terrible communication skills and pays no attention to details. I think I decided to give up when he asked if he could come over at 3 when I had said in the previous email It had to between 4:30 and 6:30.

       This weekend myself and my boy Joe moved flats. What a pain. You never realize how much stuff you have until you move, and man, I have a lot of stuff.   Sorry Joe..He.    We struggled through the weather, boxes and boxes of items, large heavy furniture and millions of steps for two days, I was almost happy to come to work this morning.    Its all been worth it because we have found possibly one of the nicest places in the area ( in our price range of course ). It has two large living areas, a super huge bedroom, 2 sunny spare rooms , heaps and heaps of sun and best of all a deck that looks out over Evans bay. We are really stoked.
