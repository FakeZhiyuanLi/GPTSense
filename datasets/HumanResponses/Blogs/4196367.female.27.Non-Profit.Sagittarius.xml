       o seroquel my seroquel,    my serotonin hunger do you quell?   knocking me flat on my ass,   what is your motive, praytell?   *sigh*  well, at least i'm awake...i'll probably fall back asleep in half an hour though. theo says to give this shit at least a month.  hey, i should contact the drug company and ask them if they need any epic ballads to hawk their medications!   Eskalith, my New and Improved:   plain old lith carb just wouldn't do.    Flat, yellow, smooth and mellow,   Discus of mood stabilization,   Come and colonize your new Nation.          ok, obviously in a goofy mood. i just woke up, and had really bizzarre dreams about (almost?) missing my flight in an airport. i never got to find out if i made the flight, but i think they were turning the plane around for me. i also dreamed my dad was a crackhead (that would explain a lot).     my hands hurt today...the fingers, and the bone all the way to the right side of my right palm. neck and shoulders as usual...ow, neck's pretty bad. i wish i knew what the hell this was. legs are ok so far.       i'm almost positive that my mother is having side effects from the shot. i'm not sure if it was a dream or not, but i thought she was in my room telling me she wasn't feeling well at all. she's not up yet, i won't bother her. i hate MS. give it to me instead and let her enjoy her senior citizen-hood.       meanwhile it's 87 degrees and there's a heat advisory. it supposed to storm tomorrow, i wonder if it'll affect my drive up to bangor at all.       my mother got me a plant a couple of weeks ago, it's a philodendron named sunny dementia, sunny d. for short. i just brought her up to my room and am very nervous b/c i've been a notorious murderer of plants in my day. so far she looks ok.

      i can't believe how sunny it is. how this room is pressurized by the yellowing star. crystal prisms hung in the window are making little jumping patterns that swirl on the rug and walls. it's so hot, stuffy like a sunday morning where you're required to wear stockings. i'm listening to "don't give up" by peter gabriel/kate bush. i used to hate this song. it's calming now.  there are 3 birds in here with me, bernard, ray and boris. head's floating b/c of the new dosages. i think i'm getting prosaic now.  ducks in and out of my life    that which sincerity beams upon       the flawless porcelain morality:             knows the cross better than anyone. "watch us, watch me, listen you mute upon that which you'll never pronounce: i am so pure. i am so goddamn loved."  let it be then. hold it close though, don't you know? learn something from history that repeats itself you dumbass.  but then again, i won't ever be a part of secret club i'm only the fascination of gum on the sidewalk pliable, colorful garbage.  so then friends find their own ways and then they are able to make friends again. find the path first? aren't i allowed to just be a happy mistake?  your mirror makes me a gargoyle smile, approval but kept at a distance, affixed at the rafters of your temple, now whose athena will you be?  it's just pissing me off, that's all. there are a lot of things (ok, not that many things) in my life which are getting more exciting, inspiring. this ain't one of them, i realize. i just hate the feeling i get when i think about a certain time when i gave all i could (not like money or anything) and god, it's not their fault. i lost my mind. it's not my fault either. still that's a good enough reason to be looked down upon. cerebral darwinism? i can't come to terms with it. i never knew how to be a good female-friend. i hope you're happy, princess. you have it all over me. who wouldn't want you for their own? and over and over again, who wouldnt'??  i never did.   meanwhile, it's almost 5 and yay, i've remained conscious throughout the operative window in which my new chemistry strikes. i can't breathe though. can't stop thinking about people i used to know. "bottom of the ocean she dwells." someone says "be proud, you're an artist." someone else says "not worth it anyway." even more someones: "enabler." they all cancel each other out because they're all rejectors of me. am i dangerous to them? when did i used to have friends? i envy them now, the non-obsessive. ideas clear-cut, linear-- each day is a narrative. each day is an egg to hatch (not to fry). they handle their emotions like checkbook ledger, sometimes it runs away but always, always back to the same page. purpose.  this is not a contest! love used to be free! why are girls like this?

      the doc changed my medication around again today. i'm a little worried...i mean, what exactly IS this stuff? why am i taking it? what's it doing to me? how did the doctor arrive at the conclusion to prescribe me this particular "cocktail," as they call it in their circles...? am i going to die? worse, am i going to live until i'm 90 and have to take this same shitty medicine for the rest of my life? how do they know that 97 out of 100 lab rats showed signs of stabilizing mood and less depression anyway? 90,000 out of 302,475  ants showed rapid heart-rates and increasing sex drives. 47 out of 576 bunnies had macular degeneration and nervous hypertension. but hey, it'll make me better.  anyway, it's good to have folks to talk to. chris, if you're out there i can't wait to see you and talk to you.  looking forward to something-- what a concept.  i'm sweating and twitching again. legs are shaking. i have an ice pack on my head and i'm still hot as hell. i'm scared. i keep thinking about that guy at the program who told me his medicine gave him parkinsonian symptoms. is it really worth it? i guess i'll find out in a couple of weeks. i'm not going to be a sitting duck for tardive dyskinesia, compulsive tremors, etc... however, i'm being paranoid. nobody's trying to keep me down...it's just me, who can't fit into society. square peg, round hole. diagnosis. history. pathology. solution? terrible chemical compounds that won't leave me alone!! solution? market cigarettes to the homeless and the mentally ill. everybody smokes there. i wish i could stop roasting my lungs.  i wish i could just devote my whole life to something. i wish i could make fucking sense. ok sean, i'm going to call you now...see how NC was. what a mother-fucking mess.

         my mom is always saying things like,  "jamie, you've had enough sex for a while. give it a breather."   she seems to have this belief that once you have a certain amount of you-know-what and then are faced with a break-up, the past sum of romantic activity will carry you through your time of non-activity...like a savings account with overdraft protection, if you will. (give  what  a breather, mom?)  i guess i wrote a check that my memories can't cash. i could take or leave the boning.  i just miss the companionship. o well. i will have hope.  anyway, does anybody read this shit? please leave comments...even pissed-off ones are helpful....!  i saw "garden state" today (movies are good for fits of nasty depression). it was excellent. i'm downloading music from the soundtrack right now. i feel drunk from the medicine.  not givin up. breathing for another day. breathing for a minute. giving CO2.  "jamie.... jamie..... i'm so glad you're mine  we'll be together a long time.  jamie, believe me, i won't let you down,  cuz you are the best lawyer in town...."

      watched the olympics opening ceremonies this evening. it's amazing how many nations were represented, some i'd never heard of before. they're on the lookout for terrorists, my mother told me. good old mom, always keeping me abreast of the worst-case scenarios.   anyway, i realize terrorism isn't a joke, but it's become that ubiquitous condition of our times. its like, "the call for tomorrow is: hot and humid with a chance of rain and possible terrorism." i think the belief in fear itself and the advertisement of this belief is, in and of itself, a form of terrorism. i hate that new commercial with bush and wifey where he says something about "choosing which child to find first on sept. 11." he can just SIT there in his recliner and glibly sneak this gem into the palpitating hearts and bombarded minds of  terrorized  americans!! it makes me want to yak.   i'm not freaking out b/c i've been freaking out all my life anyway. on bad days i'm a malfunction. on good days i breathe and pay attention. and on great days, well...i fantasize about being a misunderstood prophet. in reality though, i'm just a lightning rod for whatever's around me. i'm empathy to the point of overkill. i'm just annoying. geez, i can't even commit to being a proper narcissist.   i fantasize about being in love. i touch my cheek and pretend its someone else but it never, ever feels like it. everybody is getting married. if they aren't married, they're cohabitated. if they're not cohabitated, they're dating. and if they're not dating, they're single  on purpose.  the cheese stands alone. (i remember that book, "i am the cheese.") my mother keeps telling me that i had my chance. bullshit!! that wasn't a chance; it was a game. it was "house." i didn't play correctly. i never have and doubt i ever will. i sincerely question whether or not i am even emotionally equipped to handle a romantic relationship, period. it's just so damn sad. i lost all my chances. i'm not even cute anymore. i have a past, and i can't relate to people who haven't had to deal with some serious, major disaster in their lives.  fingers are no longer moving to the appropriate keys to the appropriate thoughts. i am really stretching. all i need is love, and i can't find it. all i have is my mother, whose love is like one of those life-jackets you wear on a rowboat in camp-- it can help you out of a jam and it has the best of intentions, but it's too tight, and sometimes you just can't take it. i feel terrible for her. i hate seeing her when she stumbles, when she falls and cries and sobs and croaks. i hate it that she can't open her eyes sometimes and she looks like a zombie.  i hate when she has to hold on to the wall to walk. i hate that she gets tired so easily. most of all, i hate it when i get ANGRY at her when i see her looking so weak. i don't understand that response at all. it's like a shawn thing to do-- prey on someone who can't defend him/herself.

      i'm so fucking lonely. i'm eating Phish Food ice cream at 2:30am and feeling disGUStingly sorry for myself in my spoiled, snot-nosed white girl middle-class suburban misery.   i feel like a prize pig. just kinda hangin' out in the mud, bloated from all the hormones and chemicals, finding joy in food and laziness. people come and look, some smile, and they all move on. no one wants to be stuck with that mess. i look forward to the day when someone will (further) eviscerate me and remove my reproductive organs.  other than this, i feel fantastic. i got to paint today, and for the first time i had a sub from Quizno's. it was good, i guess. i can sleep late tomorrow. i can watch the world crumble around me, and re-build itself again, and nothing changes.  i've been single for roughly 5 months, but really it's been longer in my mind. "Single" being barricaded human being, sectioned-off person, shares-hopes-dreams-secrets-sheets-insidejokes-with NO one. ahem. i know that everyone needs this time to learn, to "regroup," to get all their ducks in a row, if you will. finding new hobbies and new ways to create one's identity.  well, i'm once again riding a ViciousCycle (TM) by Mattel, because most men my age are into the Spears/Simpson/Aguilera Precedent of Beauty...but then again i don't think i'm really interested in the ones who adhere to this Precedent anyway...if indeed there are those who "look beyond," they will see in me a quivering mass of sick, fucked-up tissue, complacent, adorable, ready to sing a song, scrub the floor, bake a pie and administer a blowjob, just in time for the game.    ok, incoherence has just set in (drugs). it's not unpleasant at all, but sentences are becoming a difficulty.

      i saw fahrenheit 9/11 today, i'm kind of at a loss for words, other than "woah." ty azeem for recommending it... it was one of those movies that will change your life.    i'm paranoid but i feel calmer being paranoid than not. if that makes sense, score 3 points and take a klonopin.  chris, when are we going to go to woody's weiners, dammit?!  i feel really serious right now. it's been a somber day. in addition to the movie ( and  during  the movie) there were monster thunderstorms up in here. i keep thinking about soldiers, and about my dad, and about the whole pathology of the whole world getting screwed up and mutating b/c everyone is everywhere at the same time. reading "Feed" doesn't help this feeling much either. deny, deny, deny. superstitious crap. this will never end, he's right.  oh well. i'm going to put a sock in it now. i AM going to post this blob of shit that i wrote about the Masochistic Creep the other day.  i'd post his full name, address and phone # but i think he's getting his come-uppance, at least for now. god, revenge would be so keen though, especially with some formaldehyde and a Louisville Slugger.  ok, here's my own stupid little war:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A series of poses Titular gesture-drawings                    "The Ardent Hands."

      It's time. I'm ready. I feel like they must've felt when they first put MTV on the air, with the little astronaut and the MTV flag and the music...good old Martha Quinn, and Nina Blackwood, and Adam Curry and his hair...of course we all know that that particular astronaut footage was taken from an original mission...suddenly we're all weepy with the whole "giant leap for mankind" and all....(oh yeah..)  And this...this shall be the very first allegory I shall propel into the heavens of astro-cyber-artificial-happenspace! my first Blog!  I have selected a Georgia font for my musings, ponderings and panderings alike. I have no specific audience in mind. All I know is that I've been writing in little books for 14 years, and now I am typing them and publishing them on an entity that I know frighteningly little about. I've always made well-informed decisions this way. Wondering how personal to get...like, career-exploring-personal, or teeth-gunk-personal? hmm. i guess we'll find out.  i feel much more comforable typing in all lowercase. i'd go back and change everything around but this is about synergy, goddammit!! synapses firing, fingers pushing at keys, away, away!  i did this b/c i saw a friend's blog and thought it was fantastic. his blog, i mean. the idea is great too, but i'm sure there's already millions of poor shlubs like me thinking they're on their way to the walk of fucking fame just by sharing their "spirit" with the rest of the ghosts in the machine. but then again, there's probably some nice ppl out there too doing this. but they're all cooler than me.     (done?)
