      SerEnE: hMMm...hOw tO tEaCH? =xXx  limin...: Jed u toot ah...=X  sErEne: siNcE wHen iS hE nOt =xXx   YaYaYa.... Serene and limin is the smartest liao. (-.-) Gang up and suay me. Steady loh~ I just have so so so much queries about this blog thingy man. Can some genius enlighten me or help me do the whole thing(I don want the mentor to puke blood u noe).... ARH! SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP ME!  Was having my sweet dream when Serene woke me up(TMD), she asked me out to play pool when she usually will reject my offer? Miracle! Haha. She must be trying to use that damn old trick, trying to keep herself occupied so that she will not think abt HE-WHO-SHALL-NOT-BE-NAMED. That trick didn't work for her though. I caught her staring into the air as if her soul has leave her body. Must be thinking of him when she was watching us playing pool.  After the rounds and rounds of pools, we went over to Parkway Parade to eat ice cream from Siok ling's place of work. I ate 3 ice-creams and 2 large packets of fries within an hour. Man I will put on weight again if I continue doing so! After that, we tried to help Serene chose her hair dye but she still cant settle on brown or red for her hair. I need a new hair colour and hair cut too. My hair is quite long for me now and I can already see the black black portion. There is so many things I want to do but I'm now not leave with a lot of time. I want to repaint, re-deco my room, do down to Ikea to chose the table and sofar bed, buy a new stationary case and new set of stationary last but not least to get some new clothes. So many things to do yet so little time. Hiaz

      Arh!!!! This is just a dread! It took me half an hour just to think of any available username for my blog. I was in such a dilemma that I actually decided to take out the dictionary and settle on any word that is appealing to me and I still cant find any!( So suay!) Yes Yes Yes. I noe I noe. I'm dumb.... "Perception-of-love" that's the nick I'm going to settle on before I find any better nick to settle on. It is now time for me to use my pig brain to figure out how to use all the settings. It is just so irritating!

      Die Die Die Die.... I kind of spoil my sidebar which Serene help me to do. *Pondering if she will help me repair it* Nothing much happened on Friday I just slack at home doing nothing.  Thursday was the last date of my School's Freshman Camp. I decided to lead again after slacking for so long and I manage to be one of the Cheerleader. =) I played Final Crush for my LT but unfortunately We did not win. Haha we were gang bang by a lage group of other players. This Final Crush is different to that of TPSUs Final Crush. The one and only difference is that there is no rules. Yup, no rules. Haha u can do wad u like and wad u want. U have unlimited water bombs and life! Sounds cool huh. lolx. I just happily waste my 'bombs'. After that we were allowed to throw the 'bombs' at each other. My first target was Yeo! I broke one water bomb at his tummy. Angelic Yeo however did not take revenge on me. lalala I was surrounded by my teammates!!! They throw the bombs onto my pants and shirt! My underwear was soaking wet!   Maybe I should take back my words about there is no pretty babes in my LT. There is one. Yup one. haha. There is this girl in my class who's character who resembles to that of Veralynn's. I notice that she is very cheerful and puts on a big smile on her face most of the time. She is however not as blur as Veralynn. If I'm not wrong she got unless den 9 for her L1R4. Witty girl I must say. =)

      I will like to thanks Siok for helping me to do the Tag message thingy. Yaya..... I'm a html toot toot. I admit it. haha I just can't understand how it works. Need more time and exp.  Will I am not in the same class as Jonathan, Yeo or Serene... How can that be?!!!! Haiz... We were all separated and I was hoping that we can be in the same class. The Workshop is not as fun as the TPSU camp though. Haiz and most of the guys are so >.  If i'm not wrong my hair was burned!!! I stayed too long under the hot sun and the Mud i applied on my hair kind of got over-cooked!!! Lucky it better not catch fire. (-.-")  We kind of 'influence' Serene to go to Parkway with the 3 of us to have our dinner as Yeo wants to go see her ai ai.. She was so fussy and keep complaining that she want to go home. Sound like a small girl girl huh?   I went to the airport to fetch my dad who have just come back from China. Is this a blessing or a bad omen? He is going to nag at me because my room is in a total mess! Too many things to bo yet so little time. Haiz~

      Ha. You must be thinking why is the title contradicting each other. Well it is no typing error. Who said that u cant be happy when u are sick? Well at least I spent an enjoyable day with my old friends. Lazy yea, he cheated me of my feelings! I wanted to play tennis in the morning and was suppose to meet him at his place but when I reach there I only get to watch Harry Potter before going to housing Mall to get the food needed for Kenosha BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION! (Happy Birthday 17th Dude!). The show wasn't that bad actually. We ate Steamboat together in a group of 7? (yea, Birthday boy, Siok, Zc, Jackey, Jonathan and me). After that we had a hard hard ice-cream cake for Swenson. The cake is obvious too cold to the extend that Siok can't bite the strawberry and it took Jonathan a great deal of strength to cut the cake. Nice job man. After that we took a night swim after watching Incredible Tales. Even though I have read the story on spi.com.sg before. We played with dried ice in the pool and got chased away by the guards because we were making too much noise. BOOOOO~! We have enjoyed ourselves though and it is late already. That's roughly wad had happened yesterday. AND Siok did u pray haRd for me? I still lose. ARH! This is bad man. Better pray harder for me u pig!   Yesh Yesh Yesh! I'm so happy. HA. Serene made a unfruitful trip to sentosa again! YESH! HA. Mr Sunny FAILED to show up and she did not get to tan. I told ya not to go. Don't say I did not warn ya.  I am having my org camp in 5 hours time and I still can't get to sleep! Blame it on my flu~ HaizZzZZ I don't really feel like going because the reveals for the org is actually quite bad. I have to try it myself to noe how bad things can get but I still hope that it is as fun as the TPSU Freshman Camp. My FOC ROCKS~!!!!! Custos ROCKS too

      My ideal partner? She doesn’t have to be too attractive neither do she have big boobs, not as big as Shawn's can liao. Character over looks. Her looks need not be too good if not guys will be going gaga over her and when will I get my chance. Haiz... Who asked my mum to be bias and gave birth to near prefect sisters and an ugly me. Nvm~ I will be a beautiful Swan in time to come! I scare cannot transform properly then I became half half. CHEESEEEEEE... What about her character? Cheerful, nice, sociable, no temper, not too clumsy, always putting on a big smile, and most importantly open minded!( Don't think slant slant hor)  Do I still like her? That is questions that have been troubling me for months and for years. Do I like her because I like her for who she is or izzit because I am so use to the feeling of liking and to the extent that it actually becomes a habit. Anyway, she is attached now and I can’t be bother. It will be half a decade now if I still have feelings for her but hopefully not for there is a time to let go of something that is not within your reach. I am just digging a deeper grave for myself. Maybe Yeo is right, it is time for me to let go~  I have a difficult time trying to pronounce one of my classmate's names, Genevieve. What a weird name! I kept pronouncing it wrongly and there is she Jed is Gen-ev-ieve. (-.-") I just don't like that name! =P She better not see this. If not I will be >.  Had a class outing just now in the afternoon at pavilion K-pool. I didn't expect so many of my classmates actually knows how to play pool! I tot they were those who spend 3/4 of the youth studying and the other 1/4 sleeping, eating and bathing.   I met Zhi Cheng and Kenny along with their MJC's teacher? Man she look like a student to me! Serene and Limin meet me later as well to play pool and I think I lose to Limin quite a number of times. Moew! I need to brush up on my skills! Gen is the tyco queen of the lot esp. when I am playing 9-balls with her. (-.-") I lost to her even single match I think. I want a rematch! That clumsy sassy girl actually broke the ceiling because she is just so excited when she wins me. Stupid pig!     Guess what I had only an hour of lesson today. Lalalala

      Man... 21st is the new beginning for me. Kind of stress up right now because I don noe wad to expect in the months and years and I'm uncertain if I will be able to do well in this course. This is due to the opening talk by the Course Coordinator Fuck him man. =X  Well went out with serene and limin to buy myself a new bag and a new PINK shirt. =P Some commented that the shirt look very ah pak while some say is look good??? Who should I believe? Serene and Limin arh. =) (should well honour okay)  I meet Gen(my new classmate) and 'his stead wannabe' while the three of us are on our way to Hereen to buy my bag. Hmmmmm.. Poly has not even begun and yet she is hooked by some guys from some other course. There must be something attractive about her that I have yet to see. She is the cheerful girl that I’m talking about before this post.  We moved towards Orchard MRT station at arid 1800 to meet the rest of the Custos gang and went out for dinner before heading towards Esplanade for Truth or Dare. (Classic game?) I found out a lot of secrets though. hehehe Serene u noe wad I am talking about. =P I might to escape from my dare? Was asked to kiss a girl from the girl but I choose to make it into a truth. Korn. Yup! She is not attractive from some angles. She has a chubby face! Shhhhh.... =P
