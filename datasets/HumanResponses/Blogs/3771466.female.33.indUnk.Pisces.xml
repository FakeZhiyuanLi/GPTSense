      so, i just had an interview today for a promotion within my company.  the upside-- and downside-- is that this would involve leaving my home, and moving to another city and state...  part of me is excited (i have not been picked for the position yet, so excitement is premature...) and of course, part of me is down-right terrified...  i'm not as afraid of moving to a new city as what moving to a new city for my job means-- moving to a new city for my job would mean that i am one of "those people" that chooses their job (and money) over their friends.   that scares the shit out of me.

      I've been hearing that a lot lately  "Everything happens for a reason." It's kind of the less-cheesy way to say "When life hands you lemons, make lemonade!" because it's not something you say to someone who just won the $145 Million Powerball.  It's something you say to someone who's just been dumped, or had a family member die, or didn't get a promotion.  Which is another way for  me  to say that I didn't get the promotion.  I lost out to someone who already lives in Minneapolis and who is already in a position higher than me.  Actually, for the guy that got hired, it's a lateral move.  When Bill was telling me that I didn't get it and why, Bill made me think that he had pretty much already picked this guy even before I had my interview (I, of course being out of state, was last to be interviewed).  So, it's not so much that I was beat, it was that I was beat out before I'd even heard about the race.    So, I'm not bitter or upset.  Heck, it now just means that I don't have to move out of state.  But the downside is that, to prepare for the move, I've been mentally gearing up for having to move-- where will I live, what kinds of clubs would I like to hang out at, where are the good coffee shops... I had so immersed myself in that role, so to speak, that I now have to re-gear for Milwaukee.  I no longer have to tack on five hours of drive time to get anywhere south of me.  an odd dilemma...

      okay, so i met someone about a month ago. met her first in person actually, not online, and we hit it off straight away. lots in common and all that. and there was flirting and some kissing and, well... that weekend was just too darned short. so, we exchange e-mails and kept in touch for the first few weeks.  well, we've been writing to each other nearly every day-- e-mails , text messages, all that geeky technology to have simple conversations. nice thing about communicating through e-mail, though is that you can think out full sentences BEFORE they leave your mouth and cause irreparable damage...  okay, you can still cause damamge with even well thought out e-mails, but that's not the point of this particular entry... luckily...  so, we've been e-mailing and such. and i have a photo of her, and even some video footage. and she has access to photos of me, and yes we HAVE met in person already. but the majority of our communication has been cyber. so, after about three weeks of e-mails and AIM, she invites me to her place for beer and movies and such this past weekend... she lives close enough (two hour drive) that it's not an epic journey, but a bit too far to just pop in for tea.  and i had a GREAT time in our day and a half together-- she has fond memories and i have fond memories, but now we are back to the e-mail/text message/AIM aspect of our communications...  but the "problem" is that... i have to remind myself that YES she does ACTUALLY exist. see, i've been spending so much time THINKING about her (much more than i've actually spent with her in person) that i catch myself wondering... did i make this whole thing up? i mean, i am fully aware that she is an actual person that does live and breathe-- there is video. there are photos. but our physical time together has been so very brief. and it doesn't help that there was beer involved... clouds the memory and all that...  next time we hang out-- there needs to be less beer and more kissing...
