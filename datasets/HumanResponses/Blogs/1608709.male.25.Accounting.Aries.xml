       Football       Alex 'Knight of the Realm' Ferguson and Jose 'Bigger than God' Mourinho were dealt a big ego blow today.  They had combined Captain Planet-style to take on Uefa, Fifa, the Portuguese FA and basically anyone that got in their way. The hoo-har was over greasy faced Prince of pointless step-overs Christiano Ronaldo and Chelsea's 39th new midfielder this year, Tiago, and their involvement in the forthcoming super-douper massiver-than-ever Olympic extravaganza for the Portuguese national team. Fifa snorted a stern 'non' in the general direction of the two managers and that was that. So off to Athens for Lollipop-Ron and Tiago, rather than drizzly Blackburn or muddy Norwich, I bet they're gutted! Presumably other Premiership interest will be provided by Robert Pires in the diving and Ruud van Nistelrooy in the equestrian   (sorry)  .       Everton's woes continue apace. Not only are they busy looking for money down the sides of Merseyside settees, and fending away the vultures from above fat-faced man-child saviour Wayne Rooney, they are also going through board members quicker than Duncan Ferguson spends his sick pay. Insult was added to injury when stuck-up neighbours over the way cocked a scarlet snoot at the Blues' suggestion of a future ground share. As Everton were reeling from this latest body-blow, those cheeky cockney chappies from Fulham had crept up the motorway and sneaked back with subbeteo-proportioned Canadian speedster Tomasz Radzinski in their inside pocket. So some sticky times ahead for the Toffee's, but any upset Bluenoses can at least console themselves that they are not Leeds, and  they  are surely too big to go down...     Transfer news again begins with the spindly figure of Patrick Vieira. Big Paddy seems to be asking himself more personal questions than an adolescent Graham Norton (presumably not the same kind of questions anyway). Not sure if he is a big fan of punk legends The Clash, but in this case of ' Should I Stay or Should I Go ', will the answer be ' Safe European Home ' or will it be ' London Calling '. StavSport is taking this opportunity to say it is frankly sick of these will-they-won't-they transfer sagas that the football-greedy tabloids throw up every year. It reminds me of Penelope Keith and that smug moustachioed fellow in 'To The Manor Born', only without the posh accents and the tweed.     Other sports     A century in both innings for Michael Vaughan announced an emphatic return to form for the captain, as England trounced the West Indies by 200-odd runs. Moon-faced Robert Key picked up his first Test century of his career and then like the big-appetited bloke he surely is, he greedily helped himself to 120 more runs. Strauss continued his Lords' love-in with yet another ton, and if he can find a way to play all his future Test matches at HQ, then he'll have the bearded stattos in the scoring box coughing into their thermos flasks in disbelief as they rewrite the record books. But the bowling hero was not for once 8 foot Geordie Steve Harmison, but the unlikely spinner Ashley Giles, who plummy commentator Henry Blofeld once likened to a wheelie bin.     Ever since Syd Barrett sang of the delights of his bicycle in the Pink Floyd song ' Bike ' the French have been going mad for them. You see when they're not eating garlic and going on strike our Gallic chums are riding Raleigh  Burners up and down the old country all day. They've even turned this strange mode of getting from  a  to  b  into a sport. Don't scoff, because StavSport will explain it all to you. For about four weeks blokes in lycra with shaven legs and hard helmets race around France, up mountains, down mountains, through the countryside and through the cities, each clocking an overall time. The leader gets to wear a bright yellow sweater, the quickest sprinter gets to wear a fetching green jumper - and the toughest of the lot, the guy who gets to the top of the mountains quickest gets to wear a  (ahem)  polka-dot jersey. Well they like this the French, it's bigger than football over the channel, and they watch these men of steel in their pretty tight tops teararse it around the nation for best part of a month just for some Yank called Lance to win it... again.     On the subject of one sided affairs, it was Grand Prix time again yesterday, at Hokenheim in Germany, the home of a motoring übermansch called Michael. And as predictable a Bavarian cuckoo clock strikes on the hour, the Schuminator stormed home leaving Button, like so many drivers this year, happy to finish second.  I didn't watch it of course, I played MarioKart instead, and in a far more exciting race Donkey Kong pipped Luigi to the finish line after taking out Princess Peach with a timely banana skin and Wario with a homing red shell missile.   I wonder if Bernie Eccleston has a Nintendo, Formula One could yet rekindle it's excitement.     Stav.

       Footy   Everyone's favourite galactico-collector, Florentino Pérez won the election to keep his role as president of the biggest football club in the world (you may have guessed by now that this story is not about Port Vale). The repercussions of this result is not yet known, but do you think that stopped the tabloids guessing wildly under the banners of 'exclusive'? No. It didn't. Most hacks reckon that it is good for Madrid's sarong stockists, in that Pérez would rather have a pretty boy pretty average player (like our own Davie Becks) than an ugly useful one (like that Ronaldinho chap). However the newspapers then fall into two camps, the Patrick Vieira camp and the now ubiquitous Rooney camp, the latter camp probably has a pie stall.   A move for The Sun's official scouser, is a bit of a wild shot, and unsurprisingly there's little mention of it outside Britain. But there may be more substance to the big Paddy V rumours. Pérez is a known admirer of the Gunners' skipper, and has been recording his phone calls and sifting through his dustbin for three years or so, probably. Whether leggy Pat, 28 from Senegal, will allow himself to be wooed by the Spanish would-be suitor is debatable after he once criticized Madrid's image-conscious celebrity status, preferring Arsenal's footballing first nature. And I thought it was because the Londoner's let him put snot on the front of his shirt.  There was a shock announced in Paris today. Glenn Hoddle (he of defunct pop sensation Diamond Light fame and also former England manager) didn't get his plum job as French national coach. Presumably the spell wore off at the French Football Federation, and before Eileen Drewery could find anymore eye of newt, they snuck someone else into the role. The French are a bit cheeky like that. His name is Raymond Domenech, and according to Eurosport he was chosen because he knows the set-up being, as he is, the former under-21 coach. Sounds like the Old Boy's club is alive and well in Gallic parts too.  Bobby Robson has some problems. It's not that he doesn't know new signing James Milner's name, nor has he misplaced his dentures. Welsh whippet Craig Bellamy is injured again, and will miss out on the start of the season. Doubly bad because it doesn't look like big Jim Beattie is on his way up the A1 after all. According to some red top sources there's a bit of a power struggle going on at St James' Park. The director wanted to buy Kluivert, Robson thought he was an over-priced mercenary, the director wanted Nicky Butt, the manager thought he was a bit crap, the director wanted baldy brute Danny Mills, Sir Robbo thought he was a thug, and fancied Portuguese right-back Miguel, director thought he was a bit pricey. The nett result to this tit for tat is just one new signing. I bet Chelsea are bricking it!   How about this for tranfer news, Diego Maradona to Blackburn Rovers. I'll repeat it for effect, Diego Maradona to Blackburn Rovers. And now the inevitable punchline, the Lancashire club are in talks with the holy-handed legend's son, also called Diego Maradona. The 17 year old is currently plying his trade in the youth squad of Napoli, where his old man is still a near-deity, despite being fatter than a mad walrus, a mad walrus smacked up on cocaine that is. The pressure is a bit too much for young Diego junior, and has been fishing for a trial in England, and the fish that bit was ex-moustachioed Scottish hardman Graeme Souness.  Transfers actually completed, t's crossed and i's dotted lately have been Chelsea cast-off winger Jesper Gronkjaer to Birmingham City for £2.2 million, that's about the price of 775,000 bongo mags. Following Jesper from Stamford Bridge up the motorway will be Carlton Cole, who will be on loan at Aston Villa. Just as Portsmouth gaffer Harry Redknapp and Lomano Lua Lua were swapping autographs, David Unsworth turned up to join the Fratton Park love-in. Finally, Serbian striker Mateja Kezman has moved from PSV to... yep, Chelsea.  Is this the worst summer for boring transfers? Will Chelsea ever have enough players? Would Harry Redknapp try and buy your dog if you put it in shinpads? Will this season ever start?   Other stuff   The Natwest trophy meandered to it's anticlimactic conclusion, but the New Zealanders can't be blamed for the flat ending. They overcame a mini batting collapse after Fleming and Astle gave them a flying start, to set the West Indies a reasonable target of 267 for the win. Bearing in mind that Lara's lads had chased a bigger score on the same pitch against England a few days before, they were in chipper mood as they came out to bat. However if there's one thing we've learnt from this overblown tournament is that the Kiwis are nothing like the English in the field. For starters the enzedders have more than one threatening bowler, and they can also field like gazelles (that's the sort of gazelles that can catch and throw a ball of course). With nearly nine overs to spare, the final finally fizzled out like a damp catherine wheel, and it was bespectacled left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori who applied the bucket of sand, with 5 wickets at a Netto-esque economy.   Finally today, the British Grand Prix was won by Michael Schumacher, who held off the challenges of Kimi Räikkönen and Ferrari team-mate Rubens Barrichello, for his tenth win in eleven races this season. It was a stop-start affair... won in the pits... safety car was deployed... 2.1 seconds... oh Christ, I'm bored just writing this. Let's have a nice piccy of Daniel Vettori bowling in his glasses instead.   Stav.

       Euro 2004 fallout   With Rudi Voeller and Gio Trappatoni down the job centre and Jacques Santini in an even worse state at Tottenham, the word on the orange-hued grapevine is that big Dick Advocaat will have a P45 in his edam-odoured fingers by tomorrow.    Even funnier than a fat unemployed Dutch fellow is the possible plight of the French. Not only did they lose their Euro title in the tamest of manners, they are now being haunted with the collective thought of God-bothering Glenn Hoddle as manager of their national team. No, seriously, let's go with this for a moment. He has even been to Paris for an interview, presumably he took his incense, lucky charms and yoga mat (if there be such a thing). It seems our Glenda will be up against former Manchester Utd tortoise/defender Laurent Blanc, and ex-Fulham cocktail stick chewer Jean Tigana. "A foreign coach, I believe, can bring a different approach and new ideas", said the former England gaffer probably between Hail Marys and Voodoo chants.  The brand new 'best manager in the world ever' Otto Rehhagel has committed to his adopted country, turning down desperate Deutschland with an upturned nose and a rakish flick of his scarf.   Other Footy    Tranfers... newspapers... gossip... blah... blah...  Harry Redknapp's plan for world domination depends on whether his bid for Greek midfielder Angelo Basinas is successful and whether his rocket proppelled Jim Smith-shaped warship will float (last bit made-up, and probably the first bit too). Chelsea are said to be interested in a striker (everyday actually), this time the target is Marseille powerhouse Didier Drogba, and the cost may be over 24 million pounds worth of Roman's loose change. While down at football's equivalent of eBay (Leeds United), Blackburn Rovers have picked up Dominic Matteo for the price of a free Highland Toffee. Chelsea's Marcel Desailly is packing his suitcase, which means Ron Atkinson's favourite player will have to find another club to be lazy at, then again he'll probably retire.  Rooney's still rumbling, no he's not hungry again, but the tabloids are running and running with this one, today's revelations are that Everton have offered him a 400 percent payrise, while Chelsea's rather spivvish manager Jose Mourinho has decided he doesn't want him. So apparently it's a tug-of-love between scary-eyed Scot David Moyes and scary-eyed Scot Alex Ferguson. But what's this? It's Real Madrid presidential candidate Arturo Baldasano standing legs far apart thrusting his groin in the air and bellowing in a deep voice "We  can  afford Rooney". I'm impressed, are you? Is Wayne?  It's only Ray Parlour, but his ex missus has stung him a good 'un. She has won a historic legal fight for increased maintenance amounting to more than a third of his future income. Ms Parlour's lawyer had argued she rescued his career and was entitled to more of his £1.2m-a-year income, well she would say that wouldn't she? The judge reckoned she had saved his career by persuading him to "grow up" and slow down the big-drinking "laddish" culture of certain Arsenal team-mates. We thought it was Arsene Wenger who was responsible for the puritanical professionalism that had swept through Highbury, and all the time it was Karen Parlour - former opticians assistant from Romford. Next week Bruce Grobelaar's mum takes credit for Liverpool's 1984 European Cup success.   Other sports (well cricket)    Michael Vaughan once again failed with the bat in one day cricket, that's 47 runs in five matches (average of less than 10). Freddy Flintoff once again succeeds with the bat, that's 250 runs in three matches (average of 125). The burly Preston lad put on an England record partnership with posh Andy Strauss, but the West Indians still won mainly thanks to the big hitting Chris Gayle. This means, akin to a naughty ginger step-child, and for the first time since 2001, England will not be invited to their own party on Saturday, instead the final will be between Brian Lara's men and the more than handy Kiwis.  The post-mortem will continue for Vaughan's team, at least until the proper cricket starts again later in the month, but the easy solution would be to clone a few Mr Flintoffs. I have sent a copy of my blueprints to the MCC, I have also sent my plans to the FA (clone a few Rooneys and big Sols), and to Twickenham (clone a few Wilkos, preferably with working shoulder). I've not as yet heard anything back from the institutions, but I'll keep you informed.  And in inferior sports: Some motorcars went round London trying to draw attention to it's four-wheeled Teutonic predictability media circus. Red Ken was chuffed. I yawned, but an odd lethergy stopped me from switching the telly to Hollyoakes.  Some Southern toff called Tim has been appointed an OBE for services to repeated failures in the field of overgrown ping-pong on grass, and for having increasingly sinister teeth.

       Euro 2004    Here we are in the cold light of, well, early evening and is it true? Greece really are the champions of Europe. 'King' Otto Rehhagel has just written himself into the Michelin Eye-Spy book of Sporting Upsets (50 points). He will now have the choice of quitting at the top of a footballing mountain in the shadows of Olympus, or a first-class return home to coach Michael Ballack and some other Germans to an almost predictable penalty shoot out victory over England sometime during the knockout stages of the next World Cup (being held, of course, in the land of the bratwurst).  Meanwhile, now the fun is over it is review time for lazy sports hacks from Lisbon to Latvia, and who am I to resist?   Great stadiums, good organisation, super local fans filling most of the matches, poor TV coverage (punditry is a dying art - and Andy Townsend is only partly to blame), and obligatory tabloid jingoism.  The feast of football on offer, however, was somewhat akin to a meal for two from the local Chinese restaurant. A plethora of dishes, looking and smelling differently, but mostly suspiciously tasting the same, there are some nuggets of tasty meat (Czechs versus Holland was a true delicacy), but this time around they were too few and far between. I think too many of the key ingredients had been over-cooked (Beckham, Trezeguet, Klose, Raul and Vieri all showed about as much life as Marlon Brando at a Michael Barrymore pool party).  Stav's Team of the Tournament:   GK:  Edwin van der Saar  (Holland) -  Sholid shtuff from lanky shot shtopper.  RB:  Georgios Seitaridis  (Greece) -  Outclassed the Premiership stars Ferreira and Gallas.  CB:  Sol Campbell  (England) -  Sven's tactics and John Terry's sloth pace meant he was busy, and was immense.  CB:  Traianos Dellas  (Greece) -  The dinner-plate abusers didn't concede a goal in their last three matches, this former Sheff Utd man was one of the reasons why.  LB:  Gianluca Zambrotta  (Italy) -  The only Italian worthy of the azzurri shirt this year, like a fine Sangiovese surrounded by Blue Nuns.  RM:  Cristiano Ronaldo  (Portugal) -  Stepover, stepover, stepover, stepover, stepover, stepover, annoying isn't it? Spain's Raul Bravo thought so too.  CM:  Maniche  (Portugal) -  Good tackler and cool finisher, drove many of the midfield like Gerrard, Vieira and Davids were supposed to  CM:  Theo Zagorakis  (Greece) -  Platini, Gullit, Laudrup, Klinsmann, Deschamps, Zagorakis. Captains of Euro champs all, but only one of them once played for Leicester City!  LM:  Pavel Nedved  (Czech Rep.) -  Despite looking like one of The Byrds, Pavel was one superstar who did live up to his billing.  CF:  Wayne Rooney  (England) -  He may not be the next Pelé, he may be a fat scouser, but this lad lit up the group stages with some fearless displays of power and grace.  CF:  Milan Baros  (Czech Rep.) -  This Mersey based young striker warmed the benches of Anfield, and proved just why Houllier is now down the Job Club, the lad's box office and he picks Heskey!    Other Stuff   Transfers that the newspapers are trying to convince us will definately happen: Patrick Kluivert to Newcastle, failing that Middlesbrough or maybe Atletico Madrid (basically they dunno) Glasses-wearing angry short man Edgar Davids is showing his leg and doing that thumb thing to the oncoming vehicles of Chelsea, Tottenham and Liverpool managers. Ricardo the Portuguese penalty-taking keeper is being eyed up by Liverpool gaffer Rafael Benitez (that is 'Raffo' or 'Benno' as I'm sure he's known by Freddy Boswell types).  In cricket England need to win and win well against the West Indies tomorrow at Lord's to guarentee making the final against New Zealand in the Natwest series. Andrew Flintoff will bat but not bowl again following an ankle injury. Ashley Giles may be picked ahead of one of the seamers as his wheely-bin action could be affective on the hallowed pitch.  Also in cricket, the ICC have decided to go ahead with a Test match and 3 one-dayer series between the best team in the World (almost definately those modest Aussies) and the best of the rest. BBC Sport reckon a best of the rest XI would look like this:  Herschelle Gibbs (SA), Mark Richardson (NZ), Rahul Dravid (Ind), Sachin Tendulkar (Ind), Brian Lara (WI, capt.), Jacques Kallis (SA), Tatenda Taibu (Zim, wkt), Shaun Pollock (SA), Anil Kumble (Ind), Shoaib Akhtar (Pak), Muttiah Muralitharan (SL), Steve Harmison (Eng). I pay liscence fee for that? I think that's tosh to be honest. I would only pick Mark Richardson if I was struggling to sleep and had finished counting sheep. This is going to be a sponsor-friendly showcase, so even Rahul Dravid might not get in. A fit Flintoff would be a shoe-in, as would Virender Sehwag. Taibu as wicket-keeper? That'll be Boucher or maybe even Dravid surely. Mine reads: Gibbs, Sehwag, Kallis, Tendulkar, Lara,  Flintoff, Boucher(wkt), Pollock, Shoaib, Murali, Harmison (Kumble 12th man).      I'll leave you good readers with a picture of Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova.     Stav.
