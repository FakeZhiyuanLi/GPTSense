[ see more info about 'the family' in Jacquies blog.] we taught gabby how to say die and hoped that she would tell her parents. we became obessed with 'Amish in the city' and gymnastics in the olympics. we made a theatrical dance to paul mccartney featuring Micheal Jackson 'say,say,say' it was the best. i was also harrassed for being greek by jacs dad. i loved it though. jacs dad is also a mager pyro. every night the village would come down and sit with us at the fire pit. he made sure he got a cottage right near it....: yeah i know. it was cool. mike anges boyfriend also scared the crap out of us in the woods in the night. i loooooved it. we screamed, people thought we got murdered. well deg deg.      ps. we talked sims every second.   pss. jac is in london with me   stay easy playas.   demeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

The country and western star, famed for her trademark chest, is desperate for the surgery because the weight of her breasts in placing too much strain on her back. A close friend is quoted as saying : "Dolly has suffered pain for 30 years, but it has worsened in the last decade. Dolly doesn't know how she'll be able to endure the pain for much longer." Friends of the country star, famed for her passion for plastic surgery, revealed that her tiny 5'1" frame is struggling to support her DD cup breasts and that she has warned friends: "My boobs are killing me." The diminutive star, who has already had surgery to lift her breasts, is going under the knife, because even wearing a support bra cuts into her shoulders and leaves her in excruciating pain. A source said: "Dolly complains night and day. She worries that if her it's bad now, what will it be like 10 years from now?"      [ just a well known fact. some breast are just TOO big..for woman atleast. ]            yo.       i just watched the newest lord of the rings. soo long. but i got to see my idol gollum. hes reeally mean in it though..which is cool. he looked hotter then ever though. well the new exorcist is coming out looks scary .
