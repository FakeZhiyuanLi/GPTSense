       Oh, I want out. I'm not doing the group any good, and I'm not having fun. And that just makes me surly and more slow.    There's an ice cream social today, which veritable guarantees I'll get nothing done after 3:30.... well, at least I have a decent excuse.   Tomorrow, I'll work on cleaning out the old apartment with Jim and Karen. I'm not excited, but I'm sure they are. It just goes to show exactly what a messy  urlLink messy  I've been.    Somehow this blog has degenerated from an introspection into a to do/ done list. Without consistent effort, it will degenerate even further.

       This morning, as I cut through the house, Maria was on the phone and Noah(4) was bebopping around. I waved at her and said good morning to him. He was surprised to see me -- and then excited and expectant. -- "Can you play with me?" "Not today. But we can play on Sunday." --"But why?" "I have to go to work now, but I'll see you Sunday, okay?" --sigh. "okay."  Ugh. If this is even a fraction of how it feels to be a mom with an outside job -- man, what a hard life.

       It's amazing. And exciting. And probably not for me. I thought that I could use my technical acumen to help people...but it's still far more technical than relational. The attitude I sense is "I'm helping you, don't talk to me."   Bleah.  So, the tours were great, the people were kind, but the problems are just too complicated; rather they're quite complicated and too sterile.  And can I just tell you? The best time I've had this week was last night, when I got to hang out with the guys (David(7) and Noah(4)). There's nothing better than a four-year old who wants to play and a seven-year-old who wants to make plans. Man.

       Here's a long story that I lived.     A little over a year ago,   urlLink  I    was on The Motley Fool radio show. A few months later, I got an email from a guy named Arnie, who just wanted to let me know how fun it was to hear a physicist on the air -- and if I was ever interested in medical physics, I should let him know. I said I was really happy doing amo, but thanks. Then I had to write a   urlLink  thesis   . And I was very unhappy and began to think about alternative careers: maybe teaching high school, maybe peace corps, maybe...maybe medical physics? I emailed Arnie back, and within a week, had his   urlLink  reply   , including a phone number. After a busy summmer with the conference, Uganda, and Mariah-- I called Arnie. I asked about a typical day, what medical physicists do, and that sort of thing. He was very kind, and answered all of my questions; he also gave me the number of a friend of his here in town who could set up a tour of the facility  . Today, I got my   urlLink  intenerary   . Shortly thereafter, I got a call from my car dealership saying "we have the cds that were lodged in your cd player." Man, that was over a year ago! But it will be kind of fun to get them back. While on the phone with them, I set up an appointment to get my rear-view mirror fixed tomorrow morning -- while I'm taking the tour. (This is the mirror that broke during the move two weeks ago). After that, maybe I'll get a new inspection sticker -- yeah, to replace the one that's been expired since May.  *wince*

       Remember   urlLink  Pum   ? The linguistics guy that knows so much about longsuffering? He came to smallgroup last night (yes, I went. And yes, it was uncomfortable. And yes, it was good). And when asked if he was a Christian, he replied "no. I am a linguist." He went on to explain that he was interested in the language used in religious groups, both formal and informal. And I felt like I was on display in a petri dish. Not the best feeling. At the same time, this is what it means to live out my faith so a watching world can see.

       I think I might be doing that. Yesterday, after consulting with the folks who let me live in their house, I came up with this   urlLink  schedule   . And aside from being utterly tired, I think it will work. And I will love saturdays.  I'm feeling a little disconnected. And I don't want to go to homegroup tonight. But I will anyway. Not out of duty, but b/c my resistance most likely stems from something selfish, rather than anything wholesome.

       On her blog today,   urlLink  Maggi    had this to say about Lesslie Newbigin.    He was at peace with God and at home with himself, and as a result he was able to take a completely engaged interest in those who came across his path. Quite a lesson in grace.    What a great thing to say -- and what a great life to live. I want to live a life that will enable folks to say the same about me.

       Today, I had lunch with my friend Pum. We met three years ago on the shuttlebus from the apartments to campus. As most of you know, in my little world, there are no strangers, just friends I haven't met yet. So, I asked his name, what he studied, what his interests were. And I learned that Pum is a Korean linguistics PhD student -- and his research is focused on the specific language of inspiration used in self-help books. Fascinating!     We've seen each other on campus a handful of times since then. I usually wave and say "Hi, Pum!" and he waves back or says "Hi." Yeah, he's not sanguine, but I make up for it.     Today, I was eating lunch in the courtyard, and he walked by with a subway sandwich. I said "Hi, Pum" and he stopped and joined me. What followed was one of the most wonderful conversations I've had in a while. It started with me asking about his work, and family, and how graduate school is hard. Yeah, hard. And then we talked about being disciplined and how that is difficult, but oh, so necessary. And I gave my now-overtold analogy of the fruits of the spirit (just ask, I've been telling the same story for 6 years). And Pum just dissected it completely. "Oh, so you have chosen to focus on the metaphor of fruit, and how a tree produces fruit, and then you further apply the metaphor to see that peace/love/patience must be developed over time." Yes. yes, you got it.  And Pum chooses words very carefully. As a linguist, (well, he calls himself a rhetoritician) he chooses words with very specific connotations in order to carry the exact meaning he's looking for. And as a word junkie, that means a lot to me.  Pum then told me about 1 Corinthians 13, and "love is  long  suffering", and "love overcomes  all  things." He then talked about how these two adjectives describe the time-dependent process of growing that fruit. And then asked if he might share this   urlLink  essay    with me. Of course! ( It's so good that with his permission, I'm sharing it with you. )     Later, we were joined by another friend of mine, Nissanka, and the conversation turned more toward weather and new students and research. Then Pum left. And more people came: my friend Ellen from Norway, who is here for a few months working on some gamma-ray detection software. And her friend Mary the undergrad, who is working on the same code, and planning on doing Teach for America, if she can get in. I'm sure she can. I told her about some good teaching opportunities here on campus, led by some folks whose letters of recommendation might be very helpful.   Then I left.    So, today, I am thankful for Pum. For the person he is, and the easy-to-fall-into, deep conversations that we have. And for Nissanka, who reminds me that weather is a gift from God. And for Ellen and Mary, who are seeking fulfillment honestly and without apology. Pum is coming to church with me and Nissanka this weekend, and I hope it goes well.

       Warning: this is mostly a verbal burst to get these thoughts out of my head and "on paper" so I can further process them. And it's not pleasant.  My stress level can be measured in patches. Patches of angry, dry, itchy skin on the backs of my knees and the inside of my elbows. In high school it was just one knee during senior year, when I was taking 4 AP credits in a single block. I thought it was a heat rash, and just ignored it for a few months. My mom eventually saw it and dragged me to a dermatologist who treated it topically. I hadn't seen it since. Until I was writing my thesis last term. It came back behind my left knee. Again, I thought it was just a heat rash. But then, after I got back from uganda, it spread to the front of my right knee. And after Mariah's funeral, it spread to the inside of my left elbow. Raised, red patches of dry itchy skin. After the last round of data collection at the lab, I went to the health center -- where the doctor took one look at my patches, proclaimed it stress-induced eczema, and prescribed more topical stuff. I've been using the greasy topical stuff for 10 days. And the patches have gone down, reduced in redness, but are still obvious. Today was the first day without greasy stuff. And the patches back. So, I need to up the dosage -- and probably use a systemic steroid or something. But the catch is, the health center is  closed  because students will be arriving next week, and I guess the doctors need a week off.  I'm thinking I'll go back to the greasy stuff until I can get an appointment. But more fundamentally, what is it that has my body all stressed out -- and why doesn't my brain sense it? Am I worried about something? Am I sad? angry? what?  I don't know. And that is rather disconcerting. Must dig deeper.

       I went to the old place  to take a look at the couch -- make sure the largest of the dustbunnies were gone-- and the homeowners had some friends over for a barbeque.  They were happy to see me, and had something rather specific to talk about.  As it turns out, they have a prospective tennant that would like to move in during the last week of August and they wanted to make sure it was okay with me since I had paid thrugh August. Isn't that great?  They won't have any change in cash flow!  *And* she wants to buy my Thor!!!  Can you imagine?        Things are going really well these days.  And I am glad.  In the back of my mind, though, it feels like I'm being set up for some huge bad thing.  Like it can't be this good for long.  I need a handle for that feeling.  I'm not quite sure what it is.  Foreboding? naah, it's not that sinister.  More like a niggling doubt.

       not much today. Just work. and a pizza sauce incident that sent me home for a change of clothes. It's a 12 minute drive via the interstate; 8 if I just stick to the streets. Not bad. and I'm getting rid of the mini-couch tonight. For those of you who don't know, I inherited a stained and dilapidated foam loveseat from a roommate three years ago -- it had seen better days. So, I restuffed the pillows and used a slipcover and it worked as a half-reclining perch for reading. But not much else. And there's no room at my new place. So, I am happy it has found a home. Now, I just need to figure out what to do with my   urlLink  Thor.    If you guys know anyone who would be interested in buying/renting/storing a combo washer/dryer that hooks up to the sink, let me know :)

       A classmate of mine from Sri Lanka sent me an email this morning containing this link, and a request to pray for his family:      urlLink  Religious Freedom in Sri Lanka       Wow. Am I spoiled. And I think persecution is not getting to say a prayer at a football game. That's nothing.

       Please find below my unpolished reaction to the several religious group meetings I've encountered over the last two days.      Sunday school this week was about Jesus walking on water; and how Jesus has dominion over all things -- especially those that are out of our control. And how He walks over all the things that would try to overwhelm us. As ever, it was unconventional, uncomfortable, and utterly needed.  And church? Consider   urlLink  Wild at Heart    meets   urlLink  City Slickers    meets my pastor dressed up as   urlLink  Howdy Doody    all in an attempt to encourage the church to go on the great adventure with God. Now, I wouldn't mind the theme-ish and rather corny nature of the sermon, if he had left it at that. I understand being silly to make a point. But then, he encouraged us to saddle up, we've got a trail to blaze (not unlike the famous   urlLink  Steven Curtis Chapman song    of the early 90's) -- but what's the adventure? to buy another church and go multi-campus. And while that seems to work pretty well for other churches here in   urlLink  Houston   , it seems kind of far fetched to buy a property less than three miles down the road.    *sigh*    Then I had a bible-study this morning. We're working through the book of Acts. Normally I'm really comfortable in these situations, but today it felt like afternoon tea -- fake and foreign and just trying to get all the right customs in. Bleah. And I started with the equivalent of putting my thumb in the hostess's cup -- "I don't know about all this baptism of the holy spirit stuff." What's funny is that she and another lady were on a speaker phone from a retreat in Colorado. And, well, I definitely couldn't see their faces! I wonder what they were communicating one to another? Then followed a very ginger dance around the idea until we could talk about something safer -- like selling all you have and living in community. I'm all about that. The two ladies on the speaker phone, however, were about as uncomfortable with the idea of living communally as I am with speaking in tongues. It sounds like a great idea, but more that an little scary. Very ginger morning, that.    And then I got to the lab. And as I began work, I started to hum this tune. And I remembered sunday school. And it made me glad.      Dear God, surround me as I speak, the bridges that I walk across are weak Frustrations fill the void that I can't solely bear Dear God, don't let me fall apart, you've held me close to you I have turned away and searched for answers I can't understand  [Chorus:]  They say that I can move the mountains And send them falling to the sea They say that I can walk on water If I would follow and believe with faith like a child  Sometimes, when I feel miles away and my eyes can't see your face I wonder if I've grown to lose the recklessness I walked in light of you  [Chorus]  [Little girl:] "I've got joy like a fountain!" "Be kind one to others" "In Jesus Christ Your son"  They say that love can heal the broken They say that hope can make you see They say that faith can find a Savior If you would follow and believe with faith like a child    (From the self-titled CD Jars of Clay)    So, let's add that to those things I am longing for: faith like a child, community like Acts 4.

       So, I gave the talk. And it was not terrible; neither was it wonderful. Somehow the good parts and the bad parts kind of equalized into a mediocre blah. This is what I want (Thanks GK Chesterton)      What we need is not the old acceptance of the world as a compromise, but some way in which we can heartily hate and heartily love it.  We do not want joy and anger to neutralize each other and produce a surly contentment; we want a fiercer delight and a fiercer discontent . We have to see the universe at once as an ogre's castle to be stormed, and yet as our own cottage, to which we can return at evening.     Yeah. That's it.

       So, the talk has been submitted; it's not great, but it's solid. Seriously, can you ask for much more than that in 8 minutes?  Well, yes.  This talk looks like exactly what it is, like all of my talks. A thrown-together conglomeration of old slides and new data -- held together chiefly by my enthusiastic delivery....which, at least this year, is more tinged with cynicism than anything else. bleah. I started to write "I'll be glad when this is over" -- but that's not even true! I'll be disappointed by the lost memory of the talk I could have given.  This must change.

       I'm giving a talk in a few days, and it's not written yet. While not the best practice, this is rather standard for me, except that I'm usually more nervous by now. I tend to rely on that nervous energy to get me through the last big push on a presentation. And I'm just not feeling it. I don't know if my lack of concern stems from a more objective analysis of this forum (I mean, it's an in-house research showcase, for cryin' out loud) -- or is my apathy a pervasive condition?

       I came up with the name for this blog rather quickly, and rather thoughtlessly. But now I wonder, what does it mean? why did I choose this? what does it say about the life that I'm living?  Lately, I've been wishing to spend time with people that I haven't seen in too long; wanting the closeness and camaraderie that comes from shared experience rather than a few phonecalls a week. I've been longing for checkoutgirls who know my name and places suffused with memories of past occasions. I've dreamed of waking up in my parents' house, surrounded by their love and all things home. So, I'm missing the familiar, the ordinary, and the daily.  But also, on a grander level, I think that a life of consistency and perseverance -- a long obedience in one direction -- is a worthy and noble goal. Rather, at least for me, it is  the  goal. And I'm not hitting it. I'm not even getting close. I am erratic and frenetic and tend to do things in spurts. While part of that is personality, another part is the convolution of perfectionism and laziness: an attitude that says "If I cannot complete this perfectly on the first try, then I will not even begin." Yikes. So, I know that I am missing the mark of a consistent life, but do not know how to even begin the process of un-learning that attitude.  I've heard people talk about an engine missing before. When one cylinder of an engine malfunctions or misfires, it affects the entire machine. The machine's performance suffers. And the machine will not work properly again, until that cylinder is repaired. So, it's as if some part of the driving mechanism for my experience is malfunctioning; my engine is missing.    And there is a certain fullness, contentedness, peace, and satisfaction that comes in living that life of consistence and perseverance. Perhaps it is merely self-satisfaction; I'm not sure. I think it's more than that. There is a rightness in living aligned with your goals. And that is conspicuously absent from my recent (past 6 months especially) experience. So, the joy is missing too.    I plan to keep this blog going for the next six months. Maybe I'll just insert a quote, but I think it is important for me to document what's going on. I hope, really hope, that the title will come to mean something like "the adventures of a consistent, obedient, single girl" (miss-ing).    Thanks for listening.
