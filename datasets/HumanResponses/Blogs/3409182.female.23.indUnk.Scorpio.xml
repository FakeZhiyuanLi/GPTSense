      After years of throwing together sleepytime mixes, I've finally decided to take the plunge and design a mix to wake my ass up, gently coax me out of bed and embrace the coming day. I'm hoping this will ease me into a better state of consciousness than the one I usually find myself in the morning: *snooze*...*snooze*...*snore*...FUUUCK!    For the past year, I've been using my cell phone as an alarm since my last alarm clock has gone MIA. But, thanks to tweakxp.com, I have just found an amazingly easy way to get my computer act as an alarm! No messy plug-ins. No hardcore back-end scripting. Just simply schedule a task with the task-manager to play an m3u at the desired time, daily. PURE GENIUS! I'm almost ashamed that I didn't think of it myself. Humm... am also regretting admitting to surfing such geeky websites. oh well. no secrets here. i'm here to share...  WakeUP!playlist:   O Mio Babbino Caro - G.

      just got back from the FNX Boston Best Music Poll Block Party....  Was a little worried at first cos I went by myself! I was totally afraid that I'd bore myself to death by the end of the night, or feel overwhelmingly awkward walking around and hanging out by myself. I prayed that The Stills would come on early in the evening.    So I get in around 6, pick up the schedule... and find out that they're not scheduled to go on until 12:30am. And there's no re-entry... DAMN! Should I stay? or call it a night and curse fnx for not putting up a set schedule in advance. or.. could i hang in there for another 6 hours?... dammit i'm no quitter!   Sure enough, somehow or another everything came together.  I got to see Juliana Hatfield, get a postcard signed by Dave and Greg from the Stills, see the first half of the Presidents before it started to rain (the first half of the festival was in the street), duck into a bar connected to the fest, hang out with newfound friends: Tanqueray & Tonic, look real bored, meet new people to hang out with for the rest of the night, secure BADASS spot on a bench right near the stage, and catch full sets of Elefant (lead singer is Hot hot hot! but they suck suck suck.. at performing live at least), Fire Theft (this was a "spiritual experience" for the guy i was hanging out with) and... last but not least i got to see the Stills!   Elefant was a good start. but they were a little awkward and seemed like they were boys trying to play like they were in a band and were more caught up in what they were wearing than how they were playing. Fire Theft was a group of REAL musicians. Wit the 2 members of the Foo Fighters, and Jeremy singing it was so intense. The drummer was amazing! And the Stills (how many times will I have said that in this one entry?) rocked.  They really held their ground coming after FT and they proved that they had talent, could really play and they were fucking great.   How good you ask? Let's just say that someone in the audience paid them $300 to play a song over again. After holding a quick caucus by the drums, they decided to take the money. They played the song again but with a twist, and used the money to buy the whole place drinks afterward.   It was a great night. And now I know that I can go to a music festival by myself, make new friends, and have a great time.    sometimes i wonder if i'm becoming too independent for my own good..    oh well. :)
