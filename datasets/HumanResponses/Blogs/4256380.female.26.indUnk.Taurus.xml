      Why the hell did i get on the scale today? One fuckin sixty one. I knew I should wait until my period went off, but I was feeling a little smaller this morning, so I found the courage to jump on. Oh well, anyway, I ate well today. Hardly any carbs, but for the creamer in my coffee and the 2 carbs in my cheese, so that's not bad. Plus my friend is trying to help my weightloss out by cooking fresh vegetables for me every couple of days. How sweet of him! Every time I get hungry, I am going to make myself eat 2 servings of vegetables BEFORE I eat whatever it is that I want. This way, I will be full a lot faster, plus I'll shit my head off. At this point I'll try anything. DAMN! 140 seems so close, but yet so far. I better re-read my Atkins book just to get myself pumped about the low carb thing again. Don't worry, I do not eat loads of fat or anything, I just like cutting out my carbs because that seems to be the only thing that has worked for me. I think I may go take a walk or something. That freaking scale better go down soon. and i mean SOON!

      I never had a blog before, but thought that this might be a good thing for me to do instead of talking my friends, peers, co workers, people on the street,  whoever about my obsession with dieting. Am I really obsessed? I like the word DEDICATED a lot more. Obsessed seems a little too borderline crazy. Well, when all you think about is being smaller, what youre going to eat at your next meal, if you at too much at the previous meal, and stuff like that, you start feeling a tad bit crazy. So I thought that this may be a good way to get out all of my pinned up feelings I have. Mostly about dieting. First things first. I have been dieting off and on my entire life, way before I should have been even thinking about dieting. I started seriously dieting last year, July 10th to be exact. Yup, July 10, my turning point. I weighed myself that morning and the scale said 187.6, and I knew that things had to change. I was so desperate; I made an appointment at a weightloss clinic that I used to go to in 2000. When the doctor came in he was so excited to see me, but as soon as he opened my chart and saw my weight, his smile disappeared and he told me that by the following week, I would be weighing 190 if I didnt do something. Hearing those words were the beginning of the madness. There was no way I was going to let myself see 190, so I let him prescribe some weightloss pills (phentermine) and off I went. After 3 days of taking the phentermine, I couldnt take it anymore. The increased heart rate and tight chest scared me, so I decided that I was going to have to stop taking the pills and do this on my own.. and thats exactly what I did. I started running everyday.. I could only run for 1 minute at time and then walk a minute, then run a minute, then walk, but all I knew was that you dont see too many fat runners. My mom, my sister and I decided to do a diet challenge. We all went out and bought 2 of the exact pair of jeans. One pair that we could fit at that moment and the other pair had to be 2 sizes smaller. So I barely busted in a size 14 Calvin Klein. The goal for me was to get into a size 10. This was July and I had until December to do it. I was so focused, that I did get into my size 10 by December, but why am I still the size 10? Its August now (almost December again) and I feel like I should be at my goal by now. See, the problem is these THIGHS. I am small at the top and big at the bottom, and for some reason the fat just doesnt want to come off the bottom. Its sooooooo hard. It pisses me off! I weighed myself a couple of days ago and I weighed 158.8. My goal is to weight 140. It doesnt seem like too much to ask. But here I am 8 months later, just hanging out at 158. That sucks. I workout like everyday. I did incorporate weight training in my regimen and I understand that muscle weighs more than fat, blah, blah, but sooner or later, hey, the scale has to go down.. How much longer can I eat these friggin soy crisps, and fiber crackers that taste something like wall to wall carpet. I mean PULLEEZ! Nobody should be subjected to this much torture. Throughout my whole dieting venture, I have been a scale fanatic. But for the last 3 months, I stopped weighing myself because I didnt want to get discouraged when I started weight training. Well, hell, I cant take it anymore; I have to go back to weighing myself every day or every couple of days because I need that motivation. Before, I would get on the scale and no matter what, it would motivate me to work even harder. Everyone tells me not to go back to that, but what do they know? So anyway, with the water weight gain this week from this raggedy period, I am probably weighing in in the 160s. Ill weigh myself again maybe this Friday. Ill probably post more later, but I think this is a good start.
