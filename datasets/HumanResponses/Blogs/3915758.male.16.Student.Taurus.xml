      Sigh, today was a very boring day again. Although so, there are lots to tell about today ( There's something about Weng :) read on! )  7.30 am - A Flat Tree Incident It was time for duty. Another boring duty day as class duties have been cut down from checking everyone's attire and giving them summons to keeping their mouths shut. I walked along the corridor and stopped for a chat with Calvin at 3E. Then, a 'flat tree' came ( uhm...believe me... LOL ) and asked us for the directions to 4C. Being an avid ' Anti-Flat Tree Fan Club member, i attempted to tell her that the class was located at the squash complex. Calvin foiled my plan as he told the right location :( ( Nigel, kill Calvin ok?...For the other people reading this, you might know or not know why... )  7.35 am - Physics ( let's shout a pathetic 'yay', shall we? ) The day could not get any worse. The first and second period was Physics! Mr Mah was already writing notes as some prefects and I entered the class. The notes he gave us was uh...brief and looks familiar...from the text book? :P The whole class was  obviously ) very noisy, and I was kinda involved in it too :) I noticed Fluffy...uh, Chia Ern's blue stain on his shirt. I was furious at Ezra as he was still comtinuing to shoot people with liquids, this time it was G2 ink. I was lucky I did not get any stains...  9.00 am - This is so funny, I had to put it differently Weng Loong time! Lol, Mr Mah wanted Niklas, Ian and me to stay back ( yay! no BM! ) to continue to decorate the lab. Weng Loong decided to stay with us ( stop stalking Ian! ) and he was bombarded with so many insults, not only by us, but from Mr Mah! ( yeah, you are da man! ) He showed off his so-called personal katana skills ( which I associated with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles :P ) and we started to ask him stupid questions like " How are you gonna have the katana? " and " How are you gonna bring it back to Malaysia if you buy it from Japan? " and my personal favourite, " If you get it, could you do a Harakiri? " ( If you do not know, Harakiri is a way to commit suicide :P ) and he still continued to swing Mr Mah's meter ruler and started to bother Ian. Sigh...I really pity Ian. Even Mr Mah could not stand him! Well, once a pathetic loser, always a more pathetic loser in the future...  I am skipping Saravanan's class ( I wasn't there and they got screwed by him lol! ), Add Maths ( relief period ) and recess as there were no interesting stuff that time. Now for...  10.20 am - English is Scary and Tormenting...EST Pn Bhawani was already in class, randomly picking out names to present our inertia projects. Thank goodness we weren't picked, as our raw egg cracked ( it was an experiment thingy... ) and Thinesh's group went first. Their bus experiment was extremely funny, but they stole our notes! >:( Then, it was Ernie's group. Anantha's badminton act was hilarious and they kinda did a good job ( kudos! ) Pn Bhawani was quite impressed and wanted my group to do the experiment tomorrow...Well, I hope no cracked eggs tomorrow!  11.00 am - Weng Time Again! Yup! This time, it occured during English. Pn Helen made her mind to give us a general knowledge quiz. It was pretty easy, but some were pretty confusing. Weng Loong boldly asked Pn Helen whether his answer was close or not. His was right! Well, the question was " Name a person who prefers to live alone! " Well, I got right for that, and 3 mistakes ( yay! I beat Ernie! ) After announcing the answers, he started to make a havoc. He fussed and claimed that his answers were right. LOL, all his answers were SO funny! He picked lame answers for the easiest questions. For one question where he had to pick an animal with stripes, he picked a lionfish! That was so funny everyone was laughing like mad.  12.00 pm I LOVE BIOLOGY!!! The title says it all. I ran straight to the biology lab right after Pn Helen left the class. I am always looking forward to every Biology class ( although we always get many many confusing questions from Miss Varny! )Today, she taught about the tissues we have in our body. It was pretty cool. I was lucky teacher did not ask me any questions...well, I love the questions anyways. ( Not so teruk like...ahem, Physics and Chem... ) Well, nothing much to talk about today's bio class for now, except her scoldings about the class noise ( again ) and the prefects were to blame :( thank goodness I was not at fault...Oh! And teacher said ( either one of them cos their names sound so close...) Chia Ern or Charan had a matured face. Well, I do not care cos they are my 'son' and 'father'!  After skool... It started to rain...I was drenched to the toes. A brief meeting was held for the installation in August. Whee, saw Dominic sexy... ( LOL, no offence Dom. Just that I had nothing to write. ) and everyone covered their eyes...It was a drastic thing to look at! ( Hehe, no offence again ) He was like taking off his clothes in a strip-show! Taking off his clothes slowly and showing bit by bit...OK, NEXT THING TO TALK ABOUT. It was chess time. Joel kept talking about how terrible Nigel thinks as a dedicated prefect and all. The conversation continued with insulting Weng Loong, Nagulan and Sng Ming. I tried to skip chess and went to look at the rehearsel by Haikal and gang, on a street dance. Joel chased after me and forced me to go back ( not because he was responsible and all, but because Nagulan wanted to play with him! ) I went back and Joel tried to frame me by saying that I was not attending chess clubs often! I then countered by teasing Joel with his Chemistry Quiz! Even he could not understand! ( Propana? Monomer? What the...? ) And surprisingly, Barath came for chess! It was the first time both of us attended the club meeting together. He then babbled about Joel being his HUBBY and FAITHFUL ONE...ugh, goosebumps.  Until next time!

      Today was a very sickening day for me. I woke up, brushed my teeth and was ready for breakfast. Guess what? IT WAS 1 AM!! Ugh, went back to sleep and felt very groggy when i woke up at 6.30 am...  7.40 am - BM Pandemonium... It was obviously my group's turn to present our Anak Laut in front of the class ( Being Group 1 and having Haikal inside, it was SO obvious...) It turned out ok, except for a few minor problems with Abu's voice. Saravanan said our group did well ( which can be good OR bad... ) and the period continued with noise, chaos and havoc.  9.30 am - Additional Math and Additional Problems... Add Maths started late, as Mr Tan hurriedly teached us after collecting our homework. Ezra continued to squirt water to people using a liquid paper pen ( thank goodness i was not involved...) Suddenly, Jia Jen's groin started to glow and blink...( READ ON...IT IS NOT SICK...) Mr Tan then forced JJ to give it to him. At first, JJ refused, but later, he gave Mr Tan the blinking pen ( told ya it wasnt sick...)Add Maths was quite boring, and it could not get any worse when he gave us homework...  10.00 am - Recess... I walked to my cursed duty place...the Herbal Farm. Nothing much to do there, just staring at flowers, seeing red ants, staring at flowers again...And then, Niklas appeared as he made his rounds. With the perverted king around, it was not SO bad...as he spotted dragonflies mating! It was very interesting, as two dragonflies were busily flying as they mated while another kept forcing the male ( or female ) to get off...Must be a 'hubungan sulit-lah!'  12.00 pm - Chemistry...ugh It was Randip and Ridhwan's turn to 'teach' us today. My, was it a bore! They talked about Ikatan Ion, and they made the boring topic even worse. Although so, they were not to blame, as my class was already busy playing since 10.15...Cik Masnira was not happy with our class ( as usual...) and I backed up by helping to tone the class down ( which eventually did not work )  Well, not much interesting things to talk about today, no perverted stories and Weng stories. In the future, for sure! Hehe...
