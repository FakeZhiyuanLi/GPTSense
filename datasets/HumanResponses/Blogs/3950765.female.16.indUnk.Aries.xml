      Mom bought a crock pot today and upon takeing it out of the box she said "Now I can be a real mom!!"  I thought this was a funny because if i had to choose moms I really would pick mine with a few minor tweeks. haha. My mom is really like my best friend. I tell her everything. and it really makes me laugh that she thinks her momness is only complete now that she has a crock pot. she took my shopping today...i can't stand shopping with her...but today was rather nice...she spent way too much money and I feel kinda bad, but she didn't even seem to mind.  She's great you should meet her.

      Eating from Dominos more than once a week is probably not healthy. But the family likes pizza, it's one of the few things we can all agree on. Well Pa doesn't like it, but doesn't count cuz he'll eat anything.

      Thats one thing&nbsp;I've never done but would really like to try. I'd just like to find a nice guy who can make me laugh and wouldn't say he loved me unless he really truly meant it. Because the first time someone says they love me, I want to know it's for real. And the first time I say it will only be because&nbsp;I really do. Ya know hugs, and kisses, and compliment are all very nice, but favorite thing is to be held. For someone to wrap his arms around me and just hold me. I like that the best.

      I've never been one to drown my sorrows in food...then again I've never been one to have sorrows. That should be reason to stop me from eating a whole carton of ice cream. We'll&nbsp;I didn't the whole thing but I chilled on the couch and ate it&nbsp;straight out of the box!&nbsp;

      This was probably the coolest thing on TV all summer long (yes I am including I love the 90s) and&nbsp;I missed it!!! Bill O'Reilly had a 10 minute debate with Michael Moore on his show, The O'Reilly factor last night and I didn't&nbsp;find out about it until this morning. The&nbsp;"Cool List" I keep in my head...these guy&nbsp;are&nbsp;near top. Two of the coolest, most opinionated&nbsp;and most different people&nbsp;I could think of having a debate and&nbsp;I missed it. I wanted to cry.   Well&nbsp;I did the next best thing, I pulled up&nbsp;BillO'Reilly.com and MichaelMoore.com to see what they said happened.   So&nbsp;I looked to see what Mr. O'Reilly&nbsp;said first, he's my most favorite of the two. I'd give anything to just&nbsp;be his&nbsp;"Coffee B****"&nbsp;Anyway, so Bill&nbsp;has this nice article he has written up about the interview.&nbsp;Of course it's a  little  biased, but in the end he&nbsp;says he doesn't&nbsp;dislike&nbsp;Michael Moore, because he is a "true believer". I've read a couple of books Bill O'Reilly has written and it seems he's a true believer too, and&nbsp;I bet if they didn't think things so differently they'd be the best of friends. Haha.   Well, then&nbsp;I click over&nbsp;Moores site, and he does acknowledge that he had an interview with&nbsp;O'Reilly, but the only thing it says about it is basically, for more info view this site, which happens to be a site on Bill O'Reillys website. So much for getting Michaels pov. Although in my search for his statement about the interview I found out the Michael Moore's email address is from  urlLink aol@com . And he even has a blog page! This made me like him even more then&nbsp;I did&nbsp;before.   I really wish I could have watched my favorite boys battle it out.

      She Walks In Beauty by George Gordon,&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;Byron   She walks in beauty, like the night Of cloudless climes and starry skies; And all that's best of dark and bright Meet in her aspect and her eyes: Thus mellow'd to that tender light Which heaven to gaudy day denies.  One shade the more, one ray the less, Had half impair'd the nameless grace Which waves in every raven tress, Or softly lightens o'er her face; Where thoughts serenely sweet express How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.  And on that cheek, and o'er that brow, So soft, so calm, yet eloquent, The smiles that win, the tints that glow, But tell of days in goodness spent, A mind at peace with all below, A heart whose love is innocent! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Few of you will ever be prviledged enough to meet a man such as Bill Hall. He works for Jostens and he comes around to do yearbook kinda stuff. I'm not sure why i started thinking about him today, but i did, and ijust couldn't stop.  If you ever saw his picture you'd understand   http://www.jostensncyearbooks.com/NewFiles/bhall.html   go there and take a look at him...you'll know what I mean. Well, i took that picture and set it as the background for the computer. A few hours later i heard a very loud scream. I went into the den wherei found mom standing by the computer going "WHAT IS THIS!!" "thats Bill Hall" i told mom, "He's my friend" "WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM! I WANT HIM OFF MY COMPUTER!" but i can't forsake Bill like that, so i left him there me and him will take any punishment that comes at us...together!

      Back in the day...by somewhere during and&nbsp;between 8th grade and 9th grade when Valerie and Carmen Joe and Me were pretty tight we analyzed our redneckness.   I, as we decided, was Redneck By Association. Sure,&nbsp;I went fishing all the time but that was only cuz I wanted to catch&nbsp;more fish then the redneck boys, and Sure&nbsp;I had a fourwheeler, but that was only cuz everyone else around here did, and sure I'd listen to country music&nbsp;every now and then, but only so&nbsp;I could be on the same page as all my redneck assosicates. Everyone knew deep down however, underneath the overalls and the&nbsp;cowgirl hat (actually I never had a cowgirl hat. but I still want one) was a girl that would much rather be sipping tea in white&nbsp;gloves. I was Redneck&nbsp;by Association only.   Valerie, we decided&nbsp;was Redneck by Location.&nbsp;She&nbsp;didn't really do much redneck stuff, she didn't even have a fourwheeler just a&nbsp; golf cart. But she lived next door to&nbsp;all of&nbsp;her extended&nbsp;family and they were rednecks for sure.&nbsp;so Valerie was Redneck&nbsp;by Location.   Carmen Joe, now Carmen Joe was real redneck, we learned everything&nbsp;we&nbsp;knew about country girls from her. She's a real cowgirl from way back. She's always listened to country and she's had a fourwheeler even before they were cool. Carmen Joe was a Redneck By Choice.   So there we were three redneck girls but all for different reasons. Valerie called me a few hours ago to inform&nbsp;me she'd been listening to country music non stop all week.&nbsp;It&nbsp;made me laugh because&nbsp;Valerie has&nbsp;the potential to be more redneck then any of us!&nbsp;

      My Grandparents really like me and&nbsp;I really like them to.   Moms Parents:   Grandma and Papaw is what I like to call them. I'm the oldest on moms side of the family, brother is next, then the three lil girls popped out one right after the other 6, 5, and 4. So I was the only grandchild there for about 6 years before brother was born. so I was really spoiled. No one ever thought mom and dad were gonna have kids cuz they waited like 7 years after they got married to have me so everyone was all excited. I know I'm grandma's favorite. I like her the best, because I've always been her favorite&nbsp;even though I did nothing to deserve.&nbsp;My favorite thing about her is that&nbsp;she really think I am the prettiest girl in the world and that I&nbsp;have five or six boys at groveling at my feet at any given moment. She gets surprised when I pop in for unexpected visits because she thinks&nbsp;my life is so full and adventurous and she always greets me at the door with a compliment and a five&nbsp;dollar&nbsp;bill. "Buy some gas," she'll say "it's a long way here from your house."&nbsp;yeah I like her the best.   Now papaw. He's a funny guy and he doesn't really mean to be. I think brother is his favorite, thats because he's the only boy grandkid and all papaw had were daughters. Honestly I think he likes my dad better then all of us, all his daughters, and grandma,&nbsp;actually he's&nbsp;sad that before. Now Papaw,&nbsp;he likes me a lot, but for&nbsp;different reasons. He really believes me when&nbsp;I say I'm gonna be famous and he&nbsp;assumes with&nbsp;fame&nbsp;comes money, he says he wants to hang around long enough for me to make him&nbsp;rich. He&nbsp;worries, that I'm going&nbsp;to&nbsp;go get married and have kids and forget about being famous. He's been trying to get me to write a book since I was in 6th grade.&nbsp;I try to tell him I'm not that good, but he likes to brag to his golfing buddies.&nbsp;&nbsp;He often checks to make sure I don't have a boyfriend and I find these conversations most amusing.   He'll say something like "You're just getting prettier every time I see you. You haven't got a boyfriend yet have you?" Before I get a chance to answer Grandma will cut in. "One! She has to beat them away with a stick, she's got five or six just waiting on her right now. Tell him about that blonde one you had over last week." Then papaw will say something "You had a boy at your house!?!? Does Tim know? Was your mom home!" then grandma will say "She's 16, they don't need to be home they trust her." then papaw will say something "it's not her, you can't trust boys these days! Boys will ruin in your life." then Grandma will laugh and say "oh Ed, you just leave her alone." she'll slip a five in pocket as she says this. "how's that boy from FL? why don't you date that one boy thats always calling, he's a good boy?" while I'm still trying to figure out who that "one boy" is Grandma knows...Apparently they talk about these things..."Oh no, he's moving next month, how can she have any fun with him if he's 3 states away." "That what I like about him!" papaw will say "Hey Court, you want a Hershey bar?" "Yeah" "I hide 'em in my sock drawer."   Dad's Mom   I never met daddy's dad, he died before I was born, but his mom, we call her Nanney. I don't like it much, but she does so whatever. I fit in the direct middle this grandchild order. The oldest, 23 or so she's a single mom going to college and working full time. She doesn't come around much anymore, then the next one 20 or so, she's the prettiest, but she's also pretty sluty from what I hear, then the next shes 20 too, but she's kinda grumpy. Then me then my cousin ryan, he's 16 too, but he is weird, then ashley she's 14 then brother. Now brother was the favorite forever because he was the only boy with the "Roller Name" that was a big deal. But after I started writing the stupid little article for the paper and all of nanneys friends started calling and asking "Is that your little granddaughter" then&nbsp;I became the favorite. She thinks everyone should be more like me. She also doesn't remember that The Nanney Trap&nbsp;was my idea.   But that is another story for another time&nbsp;

      "You need to focus more on whats important." that's what mom said after insisting I was irresponsible for leaving the window rolled down. This was only after dad has called me three times today to fuss about and wonder what&nbsp;I was thinking. Yeah I flooded the car but&nbsp;I really didn't mean to.   So anyway, I tried to do what mom said focus on what's important. I'm sure she meant work on my summer assignment, so I did that for a while but I got bored with that real fast, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;figured I'd focus on some other important stuff.   Now this is a&nbsp;big election year, that's important.&nbsp;nothing good in the paper and I didn't feel like reading anything on the internet. So my search continued.   Fruits and Vegetables are&nbsp;important I thought. So I tried&nbsp;to figure out how many fruits and&nbsp;veges I had eaten today. umm if pizza sauce counts then 1.&nbsp;That made me feel bad and unhealthy. So&nbsp;my search continued.   Cleaning my jeep! Now that is important, I've been meaning to do that all month. I started to go outside but remembered that my stupid car was what got me into this search for importance into he first place. So we are moving right along.   Singing is important so I got out my voice folder and sang a little, but my head started hurting.   So that when I went to the medicine cabinet b/c tylonal is important when you have a headache or an addiction. But I was too short to reach it.   Height! now that is something really important. So I asked mom if to get to measuring stick out to see if&nbsp;I had grown any. She said no   DADDY IS HOME!!! NOW THATS IMPORTANT!   &nbsp;

      Last nigh, the thunder storm woke me up. I couldn't get back to sleep for a while and&nbsp;I started thinking about when brother and me were little. His bedroom room is directly across from mine and so when ever there would be a thunderstorm in the middle of the night that would wake us up we'd meet in the middle area inbetween our rooms. If one of us happened not to be waken up the other would wake them up. Then we'd grab hands and run as fast as we could through the dark house into mom and dads bedroom. We'd climb in bed with them where we'd feel safe and then we could fall asleep. I think last night was the first time&nbsp;I ever really missed that.&nbsp;

      Actually,&nbsp;I could very well be crazy. I have been unusually emotional over the past two days and I really have no idea why. Yesterday&nbsp;I cried&nbsp;four or five times. I'm not crier, a whiner maybe, but not a crier. I cried&nbsp;more yesterday then&nbsp;I have all year put together.   This morning&nbsp;I got up and got ready to go babysit, determined to have a good day. I walked out to my car only to find I had left my&nbsp;window open last night and there was about 2 inches of water in my floor&nbsp;board. I started crying again. I was 30 minutes late for work and my car still isn't completely dry.   But all&nbsp;in all, nothing in my life is really that&nbsp;bad, sure I've had a couple of bad days this week.&nbsp;I don't really have a reason to be so emotional though, I mean bad stuff happens to everyone and&nbsp;my trash isn't even that bad. So why am&nbsp;I&nbsp;crying about it?&nbsp;   I mean, my parents nag a little and they expect a lot but they trust me. And brother yeah he's annoying as trash but he wants to be just like me so I an't blame him for being annoying, I'm annoying. lol. I have some really great friends who are always there and like me for who I am.&nbsp;   So my life is&nbsp;pretty great,&nbsp;idk why things are getting to me so much lately. It makes me mad at myself.&nbsp;

      Ok I know you guys have heard the story a million times, but it was probably the most romantic thing that will have ever happen to me and just one more very last time won't hurt anyone. Then I'll put it all behind me, put his picture in "the box"&nbsp;and think back fondly&nbsp;only every now and then.  So It was Clearwater&nbsp;Fl in October. Fl is great anytime, but i like it best in the fall. the days are sunny and warm enough to go swimming and the nights cool are enough to put on jeans and light jacket. When I think of perfect thats how it feels.   Sunday night, we had gotten there only few hours earlier, but i wanted to go to Peir 60. It was in walking distance so&nbsp;thats what we did. My favorite thing to do&nbsp;when we go to&nbsp;Fl every year is spend the evenings at the peir. There is always music and dancing, and people selling little odds and end, there is always a small breeze, and the white sand is always warm. If you happen to&nbsp;walk out on the beach at night time no one else is there and you can feel like you&nbsp;are&nbsp;the only person in the&nbsp;world for miles and miles.  That year my aunt kelly&nbsp;her husband and their 2&nbsp;little kids came with our family.&nbsp;I stood with my Aunt while&nbsp;we let her girls play on&nbsp;the play ground,&nbsp;i looked over and say a guy sitting on one of the benches outside the play&nbsp;ground. "That guy&nbsp;is looking at you." she said. Of&nbsp;couse i didn't wear my contacts that day, but i took her word for it that he was cute. We stood talking for about 10 minutes and every time&nbsp;I looked at him he was looking at me.&nbsp;"You shouldn't be so shy." she told me, "Wave at him,&nbsp;we are only going to be here and week and you'll&nbsp;never seen him again."&nbsp;but&nbsp;I protested and explained&nbsp;i didn't do stuff like that, thats when the&nbsp;bet came. "I bet you 10 dollars you won't wave at him." dagone, I'll do just about anything for ten dollars. But i made her promise we'd leave right after i did it.   So i did, and he waved back. Then we walked&nbsp;across the 4 lanes of traffice you had to cross to get back to the motel. We had just made it to the other&nbsp;side of the sidewalk&nbsp;when all of a sudden all the cars start honking and people start&nbsp;yelling out&nbsp;of their car windows. I turned around and&nbsp;dodging cars in the middle of the road was that boy.&nbsp;I looked around me and the whole family had kept on walking to the room,&nbsp;I looked up at him and&nbsp;thought "wow&nbsp;he's a sexy beast."   He was a little out of breath,&nbsp;and he held out his hand to shake mine. I still remember exactly what he said. "Hi my name is Troy." I smiled,&nbsp;"Hey I'm&nbsp;Courtney." "I'm sorry,&nbsp;I hope i'm not freaking you out, but you are too beautiful for me to&nbsp;just let walk away." (ok so maybe it was a sappy line, but I'm a sappy girl and it worked.) He&nbsp;gave me&nbsp;his&nbsp;business card and asked me to call him later that night. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I did and we had so much in common, execpt for the fact he was 17 and two years older than me, drove a red convertable, and&nbsp;lived in a house right on the beach. He&nbsp;went to same high school daddy went to when he lived there, he was 6'2, brown hair, blue eyes, he played basketball and ran track, he had even been chosen to go to ballroom dancing competetion when he was in middle school.   The next day he called me and asked if we could get together so we made plans to meet at the peir later that night when he got off work. So he came, he walked over and after to hellos he asked to meet my mom.&nbsp;I introduced him to her and he asked her if it would be ok if we went for a walk on the beach. She couldn't say no to a guy who asked her permission. So we walked out on the beach.  We took&nbsp;our shoes off and walked along the edge of the water.&nbsp;We&nbsp;walked under the peir I&nbsp;remembered I&nbsp;walked right under but he&nbsp;had to duck.&nbsp;"Do you want to sit down somewhere?" he asked. "Yeah."&nbsp;I said but we&nbsp;kept walking so after a few more steps i&nbsp;suggested "Lets just&nbsp;do it right here." "WHAT?"&nbsp;He&nbsp;he looked a little frightened.&nbsp;"OH!" i was a little embarassed, "Sit&nbsp;down&nbsp;I mean." we had a good laugh.   Se we&nbsp;walked out to the very edge of the water,&nbsp;to where we&nbsp;were just barely far enough&nbsp;away that the water&nbsp;didn't touch our feet. I looked around,&nbsp;we were the only people on the whole entire beach for as far as i could see in&nbsp;both directions. The moon was full and sitting right in front of us, and the waves washed in and out quietly.&nbsp;It was strange because in all my dreams about the perfect romance this is where we always ended up on the beach alone with the moon and the waves. It&nbsp;the beginging of my fairytale and&nbsp;I doubted&nbsp;then and still do now that it could ever be topped.&nbsp;  We sat for&nbsp;a while just talking about how he liked the way i talked and the fact that my hands were so tiny, and how he regretted&nbsp;there were hardly any stars there because of all the lights&nbsp;from the city. Then we stopped talking, there was no need to,&nbsp;everything&nbsp;was too perfect. He scooted over beside me and just as a cool breeze blew by he put his arm around me.&nbsp;  I remember&nbsp;debating on whether i would let him kiss me or not, i knew he was going to try to. I would have been insulted if he hadn't. I decided, if he asks me I'll let him, if he&nbsp;just does it&nbsp;then&nbsp;I'll pull away.  He&nbsp;was looking up at the moon when he asked. "Would it be ok if&nbsp;I kissed you?" I nodded,&nbsp;I couldn't have spoken if i tried. And so he leaned in and kissed me.&nbsp;Afterwards&nbsp;I regretted wasting a first kiss somewhere else and wished that could have been my first one.&nbsp;  We&nbsp;sat there for a little longer and thewe walked back to&nbsp;my parents, he stayed and talked with my family a little longer and promised to call me the next night.&nbsp;we got together every night for the whole week&nbsp;I was there but the first night was the most magical.  &nbsp;Friday, the last night I'd be there,&nbsp;we made plans to go out for a&nbsp;ride on the strip in his car. But we both had a change of events and we only got to spend 15 minutes together that last night. Hr promised he'd call me soon and&nbsp;he talked about all&nbsp;the things we would do together when i came back the next year.  As we pulled out of the motel parking lot Saturday morning i asked dad to turn on the radio. the song playing was "One More Day" by Dimond Rio and i felt like crying, i knew&nbsp;he wouldn't&nbsp;call me, i wouldn't have expected him to, and i didn't know if i wanted him to.  About a month after we had been home he did though and told me how much he missed me. He called me about every month after that, but the best was when he&nbsp;called me on valentines day. I was on a sking trip though,&nbsp;but he left a message of happy valentines day with my mom for me and he called the day i got in and told me&nbsp;he&nbsp;spent had spent valentines day at his sisters playing with his nephew because he&nbsp;couldn't have imagined being with anyone&nbsp;but me so&nbsp;he stayed in.  The last time we talked was early&nbsp;June he was getting ready for graduation.  So&nbsp;i was only 15 and&nbsp;I&nbsp;didn't and still don't&nbsp;know anything at all about love and romance but&nbsp;It was that perfect week of my life. If we never talk again I'll be satisfied with how everything&nbsp;went&nbsp;and i'll be happy that it happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I spent over 45 minutes typing the longest blog in history. It was about my horrible day and how many times&nbsp;I was brought to tears and all the awful things&nbsp;I went through. Then to top off the Bad Day Cake as&nbsp;I&nbsp;finish the last sentance, no lie i pushed the period and the computer froze. 45 minutes&nbsp;wasted. But&nbsp;I suppose thats what makes a bad day;&nbsp;Isn't it called Murphey's Law "Anything that can go wrong will."&nbsp;  If there ever was a perfect bad day,&nbsp;I had one. I couldn't help but laugh.&nbsp;

      Usually around the end of summer&nbsp;I re read my journal, and&nbsp;make some goals for the next school year. I pulled out my journal tonight and I found this entry that pretty much summed&nbsp;up my feelings for&nbsp;the whole year.   &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 03-28-04    It's a beautiful day outside. Sunday afternoon, sun shining, and the&nbsp;temperature is in the high 70s.     &nbsp;   But all&nbsp;I feel like doing is lying in bed, daydreaming, and thinking pointless thoughts.     &nbsp;   I've listened&nbsp;to some songs,&nbsp;re-planned my future, an watched a romantic movie.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I was thinking...by the time I am 25, I'll have already lived over a quarter of my life. 25 is only 10 years away&nbsp;. I haven't done anything so far. Nothing. I'm not even talking about something spectacular like&nbsp;saving the world, feeding the hungry children, or changing&nbsp;someone's life.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   No, I've&nbsp;never even taken a chance!&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      I was flipping through my box of school projects that I have saved over the years and I found this one from Contemp. Lit. in 9th grade. One part of the project was to write down 25 things that made us happy. All of the things on my list still make me happy.     Cows  Songs about feeling pretty  Skirts  How much my parents love each other  Turtle necks sweaters  Toe socks   My favorite blanket  Letters in the mail  Church  Compliments  All the old ppl at church who compliment me  Pig Tails  Boys who wear sweaters  Dancing  Sitting on the swing with my *recently deceased* pretty kitty  People playing with my hair  Funny movies  Funny people  Mom trying to be cool  My baby pictures  When Brother asks me questions about life (ex. why is the sky blue? why is grass green?)  Being Daddy's little girl  Chivalry  Bubble baths  Life

      Holy Cow the coolest thing in the world happened today. Mom came in from going to the mail box she had an envelope for me. Well I was really excited because&nbsp;I LOVE getting letters in the mail. I figured it'd be a letter from my old pal Chad, this guy I met last&nbsp;summer, who writes me every now and then.   Well&nbsp;I opened the letter, excited to see how he was&nbsp;doing only to realize the letter wasn't from Chad at all. It was from Africa!!!   See every year at Christmas, we always&nbsp;make one of those shoe boxes full of toys and candy and stuff&nbsp;that get sent to kids in poor countries. This year&nbsp;I dropped a little letter in the bottom of the box, I&nbsp;never expected to get a return.   But holy cow the little girl who got the box&nbsp;wrote me back    Hello,     My name is&nbsp;Sana Risnata. I&nbsp;am&nbsp;9 years old and I am in the 2nd grade. I received your&nbsp;gift. I am very happy with you. I wish you a good year.    of course it had went through a translator, but she left her address and&nbsp;so I think I'll write her back&nbsp;sometime soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Today everyone in moms family went out on my Aunt's boat. Well last night I straightened my hair, and doing that takes about 2 hours. Now my hair looks pretty nice when I do this, the only problem is, should the tiniest drop of water touch it the whole thing tangles and frizzes out into an unmanageable, untouchable mess.   So I was determined now to get my hair wet, this means not even thinking about getting in the water, tubing, or riding the jet ski. I was cool with this, I even put a towel over my head when we went over big waves. I did great 3 hours on the boat and my hair was still straight and shiny. I was feeling good. So the time came for us to get off the boat, well dad got off first and he was holding on foot on the boat and one on the bank he held out his hand to help me across.   I grabbed his hand then jumped onto the bank, but I didn't jump far enough so I start to fall. No worries though, Daddy wasn't gonna let his princess fall on to the jagged rocks and rotten logs below us.   &nbsp;So he pulled me back up, but this only made me lose my&nbsp;balance even more and I go tumbling head first into the water. I flop back on to the back and when I open my eyes to my wonderful surprise there is a dead frog laying right beside my nose, guts squeezed out and everything. And yes my hair got soaked.   Mom says one of favorite things about me, is my ability to laugh at myself. and yes I was laughing but it was only to keep from crying. She also said, she'd have been ok with me letting a few curse words fly.

      I never knew so much hate could come from a trip to food lion.   Ok so I went out to eat with the family today and being the graceful lady I am, I got some ketchup on my shirt. I hate when that happens. So after we eat we stop by food lion because we are out of the dishwasher stuff; mom asked me to go in and so I did. Half way through the parking lot I remembered I had ketchup&nbsp;on my shirt, but I was too far to turn around. So I did&nbsp;what any resourceful southern belle would do...tucked the stain under my boob and kept on going.   Now I'm in the store...I go down the wrong isle three times...and it was getting kinda ill. Then I had to make a choice on what smell to get. Lemon, Fresh, or something else...I picked the green box cuz thats what we had last. I hate making decision that the whole family has to live with for at least a month.   So I go to the cash register. Now don't get me wrong, I like when the check out lady is polite and friendly, "hey how are you?" "fine thanks" "nice whether we are having" "have a nice day" Yeah&nbsp;I like that, but&nbsp;I hate it when the cashier lady trys to have a conversation with the ppl in front of me when I all&nbsp;I want to do is get my kecthup stained shirt and my green box of dishwasher soap out of the store before I see someone who knows me.   After she&nbsp;sceranded the ppl in front of me with a&nbsp;verse of the Oscar Mayer theme song the cashier finally said have a nice day&nbsp;and reached for my soap.   "Well, why aren't you smiling Ms. Courtney?" she asked, "Thats not like you!"   I looked up....who the heck is this girl? I say inside my head but force a smile, no need to disappoint her. "Well how has your summer been?" she asked me, and she wasn't just asking she really cared.   Dagone I thought, glancing at her name tag....Brittany...Brittany...I don't know a Brittany...are we related...no....did I have any classes with her....no....Church....no....how the cow&nbsp;does she&nbsp;know me then. "it going good"   "I saw you at walmart today" This time the comment came from the bag boy.&nbsp;It took me a moment but I realized I knew who he was. He was Brian...you guys&nbsp;remember&nbsp;Brian don't you...yeah you do my first lil boyfriend we dated for a whole month or so my freshman year, then&nbsp;I can't remember why, but we stoped talking.&nbsp; Valerie, insists we've been dating all this time, and if so well then it's been wonderful. But I hadn't seen this kid in 2 years and now he wants to start talking to me.   Well at least it made the unknown&nbsp;cashier girl stop talking to me. "Did you really?" I asked in a tone of voice that suggested we'd been friends all these years.   "yeah he said you were..." but he was interupted by&nbsp;Brittany "You shouldn't be stalking my customers Brian!" she said. I smiled...it was what she wanted me to do...   "How are you doing?" I asked Brian, I thought about breaking up with him, or at least&nbsp;demanding he pay up the two years of Christmas presents he owed his girlfriend, but I wasn't sure if i&nbsp;should invovle&nbsp;his colleagues&nbsp;in our personal affairs.   "I"ve been working a lot? How about you?"   I've been waiting on your phone call darling,&nbsp;isn't it about time to say&nbsp;I Love&nbsp;You.&nbsp;but I&nbsp;settled on "I've been hanging around."   I got my bag... I would have just left...but these people were my friends...I think...so I said "well see you guys later"   "Bye Courtney" said Brittany   Man&nbsp;I hate it, when I have no idea who people are, she probably one of my best friends.&nbsp;

      Today&nbsp;I did something I realized&nbsp;I had never done before   &nbsp;Well, I was in the mood for some Toco Bell but stupid me missed the turn for the interstate, so I just kept&nbsp;on going&nbsp;and drifted&nbsp;towards Henry James...not one of my favorite places but I was drawn there so I looked on the menu&nbsp;and I saw BBQ Chicken...well it was no toco, but I like chicken so&nbsp;I thought why not.   Well&nbsp;I got home and and opened it up and there was a whole lotta chicken in the box, so I thought decided to just eat the leg now and save the rest for later. So I pulled the leg off and&nbsp;I started to&nbsp;pull a lil piece of chicken off the leg....then&nbsp;I thought.&nbsp;Ya know what,&nbsp;I&nbsp;have&nbsp;never just bit&nbsp;down into some&nbsp;a chicken leg, I've always been polite and lady like and just eaten lil pieces&nbsp;at a time.&nbsp;No one was home and I was wearing an old t-shirt so you know what&nbsp;I did, you're right I&nbsp;just ate the chicken right off the bone, no sissy one piece at a time crap. I ate my chicken like a real man and it felt good!&nbsp;

      Ok I know I said I was going to try really hard not to over feed Frank. But he's not growing any fatter&nbsp;and&nbsp;I find myself wanting to feed him everytime I see him. I 've fed him four times today. Sometimes I forget how many times he's eaten, but sometimes I am compeltely aware and&nbsp;I just fed him and&nbsp;I do it anyway because I like to watch him eat. He makes&nbsp;such a fun noise while he is&nbsp;eating and&nbsp;I love it. I know&nbsp;I am an awful person, but&nbsp;I do love him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I was watching this show on the&nbsp;National Geographic channel&nbsp;today called Taboo. It's a really cool show and I like it. I only caught the end of it, but what I saw was pretty sad.   In Nepal they have a living goddess. They take a four year old&nbsp;little girl who has to pass all these crazy requirements and once she does she becomes a goddess. She has to dress up in fancy clothes and extravagant makeup&nbsp;everyday and&nbsp;just sit around&nbsp;in this room in the palace. She only gets to go outside&nbsp;once every&nbsp;few years and she can't see her family very&nbsp;much. She can play with the kids in the palace sometimes, but she can't do much because if she ever bleeds, she can't be a goddess anymore. So if&nbsp;she gets a&nbsp;cut or bleeds when she loses a tooth she is no good anymore because they say the goddess leaves her body. So around the age of 12 or 13 when she's not a goddess anymore they&nbsp;send her back to her family. Well she's&nbsp;been locked up all these years and&nbsp;so she is very shy and&nbsp;uncomfortable around people and she can't talk very well, because she wasn't allowed to as a goddess. Then she has to start going to school with the other girls&nbsp;her age and she is really far behind. That sucks pretty&nbsp;bad, but it gets even worse. She'll probably never get married because the rumor has it that any man who marries a former goddess will die an early death.   Seems like a pretty crappy way to live life and it bothered me a lot. I guess thats why I just spent the last 10 minutes&nbsp;writing about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I've have to babysit brother all this&nbsp;week because mom is working at church while some lady is out of town. Well, I also have to feed him lunch and supper. So Sunday mom asked what she should buy for me to cook. I told her we'd be fine eating Burger King for lunch and Dominos for Dinner everyday. She didn't like that idea but it gave me and idea! So we bought the stuff to make homade pizza. I told brother about it and he got excited, because we always wanted to do this when we were younger but ma and pa wouldn't let us.   So anyway we were supposed to do it yesterday but&nbsp;I wasn't home, so about and hour ago brother asked if we could go ahead and make the pizza. I had nothing better to do so I said sure. So we made them and put them in the oven.&nbsp;When they were&nbsp;finished,&nbsp;I got them out and cut Brother a slice. He took a bite.   "How does it taste?" I asked him. "Like arm pits" he said and took another bite. I started to get angry and yell at him for being so picky and inconsiderate and ruining our childhood goals, but then I took a bite of the slice I cut for myself. Yes, it did indeed taste like arms pits.   We sat down at the table and had two slices a piece. "We should open a pizza parlor" Brother said, and call it "Matt and Courtney's Arm Pit Pizza"   "I like 'Courtney and Matt's Arm Pit Pizza' better"&nbsp;I said&nbsp;

      I don't like my dog Gabby, she is a Dalmation, but she is a midget like me...you'd think b/c of our vertical challenges we'd be close...but we are not.  &nbsp;  One of the things I hate most about her is when she stick her back paw into her ear and scratches. Thats not so bad...yeah the dog scratches her ear. thats cool. But then everytime, without fail she does this same routine. She stop scratching, smells her foot, the licks her toenails till they are cleaned from all the ear nastys. Yes I do not like my dog one bit  &nbsp;

      Do you ever remember stuff, but you can't quiet remember if it really happened or not? That happened today...I had this memory of me and Carmen Joe when we were little at the beach riding the jet skis with her cousin Neil, and him flipping all of us&nbsp;off.&nbsp;Now I couldn't&nbsp;remember if it really happened or not...idk why I'd make up that memory, but&nbsp;I had to ask Carmen Joe if it really happened. Don't worry though, she remembers it too, so it must have been real. I'm glad... because it was fun.&nbsp;

      Most of you who know me well, know that I've been planning my little wedding since I was about 7 years old. Now some people *cough*cough*ben*cough*cough* say wedding are stupid and pointless and a waste of money, but I think weddings could be  one of  the best days in a girls life. And as far as a waste of money... Mom and daddy didn't have a big wedding and&nbsp;I am the only daughter so they'll be happy to dish out a couple mil for the ceremony...just kidding...but they won't mind because they know how much it means to me!  &nbsp;  Well now for the plans....well after&nbsp;I meet Mr.&nbsp;Perfect, as described in a previous&nbsp;post, and&nbsp;I have plenty of money and a career going in the direction&nbsp;I want and we've dated for an apporiate amount of time.&nbsp;He'll get down on one knee and pop the big question. then we'll get married!  &nbsp;  Now&nbsp;before the wedding, instead of a bachlorete party, I'd rather have a weekend get-away with four or five of my favorite girl friends,&nbsp;Jonsey doesn't know it, but she is gonna plan that. Now for a wedding shower, I don't really want an&nbsp;all girls get together kind of&nbsp;thing...I'd like to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;big &nbsp;cocktail with all of our friends. Then maybe a cookout with both of our families.  &nbsp;  Then for the actual wedding, I don't really mind where&nbsp;I get married but I want to walk down some stairs. Like&nbsp;I want big doors to open and it's just me standing there all prettfied and then I'll walk down these stairs and meet dad and the bottom where he will walk me down the isle.&nbsp; I want a whole lot of people there!  &nbsp;  So then we get down the isle, I don't want a lot of brides maids, just one, maybe 2, but as of now, just one. That will be Jonsey, as long as she isn't pregante, but we've already worked that out and she's gonna hold off on the having babies till after I am married, cuz I don't want a big bellied Jonsey at the alter with me, even though&nbsp;I love her dearly!&nbsp;If she's the only brides maid I have then I won't care too much about what she wears, but I'd like it to be red, or blue, maybe even a black dress.  &nbsp;  Then my lovely husband will be there I want him in a black tux with a long coat tail...I'd like that! I don't care how many groomsmen he has but they have to be in black tuxes.  &nbsp;  Now my dress. Of couse it will be white thats a given, but&nbsp;I want it to have a long long train, and I want it to hang off my shoulders. Now I know this is really outdated and old fashioned, but I don't care I want to keep the veil over my face until it's time for the big kiss and then&nbsp;I want him to lift it.  &nbsp;  I want a flower girl, but I don't know what kind of flowers&nbsp;I want.  &nbsp;  Now for the reception, the first dance,&nbsp;I don't know what song I want played for us. But for the&nbsp;dance I have&nbsp;with my daddy I want&nbsp;"Because&nbsp;You Loved Me" by Celien&nbsp;Dion. that will be dedicated to mommy and daddy. I want a lost of line dance songs played. Now the cake...the cake I want a big cake, Red Velvet! and you know who I want to make it, that lil Fancy Pastry&nbsp;Bakery right here in town, b/c they have the best icing in the whole wide world!&nbsp;I want a big big reception with a lot of people drunk on&nbsp;champaign!  &nbsp;  Then we'll&nbsp;ride off in our nicely decorated Just Married black limo.  &nbsp;  I can't wait!&nbsp;&nbsp;

      There is something I've noticed lately and&nbsp;in the end it is probably going to kill me. It's these signs some idiot is putting up telling people to vote. Thats wonderful, expect for the fact that the signs are smaller than a piece of notebook paper and it is almost impossible to read them as you are driving&nbsp;down the road. I have almost&nbsp;wrecked countless times at the stop light&nbsp;near&nbsp;Daddy Rabbits.&nbsp;Now they put up another&nbsp;set of signs going across that bridge on&nbsp;the way&nbsp;to burger king. Holy cow I've almost run off the bridge 2 times already and I still can't read all the signs b/c they are too small. Someone is going to die&nbsp;because of those signs&nbsp;and dead people can't vote!

      Isn't that butterfly feeling you get in your stomach one of the greatest feelings ever? I think so  &nbsp;  I was listening to the radio, actually it was&nbsp;"Love Songs With Deliah"..lol... and a song came on that I hadn't heard in forever and&nbsp;it was one of my favorites, all my favorite songs give me butterflies. It was&nbsp; "I Can Love You Like That" by Boys II Men. My favorite part is that 1st verse  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They read you Cinderella  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You hoped it would come true  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That one day your prince charming would come and rescue you  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You like romantic movies and you never will forget  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way you felt when Romeo kissed Juliet  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all this time that you've been waiting  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't have to wait no more  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can love you like that"  &nbsp;  I know, I know I'm pathetic! But I just can't help it.  &nbsp; If you think that's bad, you know what other songs give me butterflies "Kiss Me" by sixpence none the richer, "My Heart Will Go On" from Titanic. "A Whole New World" from Aladdin, and the worst one yet! That Beauty and and the Beast song they&nbsp;sing while they dance. That one really gets to me. Yeah&nbsp;I'm too wholesome for my own good. *sigh*&nbsp;&nbsp;

      For those of you who don't know, I have a younger brother, he's 10 and we don't really get along very often.  &nbsp;  Such as...This morning mom told me to go wake brother up. So I began to jump on his bed and sing my favorite song "I Enjoy&nbsp;Bring A Girl" this is one of the ones brother hates the most, and I am completely aware of that. So anyway&nbsp;I am singing and jumping but he's not stirring. So I go to plan B&nbsp;kick his butt out of the bed. So&nbsp;I sit down inbetween him and the wall, put my feet on his&nbsp;butt and push with all&nbsp;my lil might. This plan worked, he went flying off the bed&nbsp;and once he picked himself up off the floor&nbsp;he began to yell&nbsp;like a mad man and make this angry face.  &nbsp;  Now&nbsp;I knew I was in trouble because&nbsp;I was stuck in between a wall and&nbsp;recently and rudely awaken phase and&nbsp;I couldn't get out. Brother began punching me rapidly in the arms&nbsp;and legs. I went away limping and I know I will have many bruises tomorrow.  &nbsp;  So a few hours later Brother was eating one of those lunchable pizza things and I wanted&nbsp;a bite so I said "Brother can&nbsp;I have a bite?" he said "No, go away" I knew however that deep down he meant yes. So I picked up one of the piazzas and took a bite, but HOLY COW donkey boy had put those things in the microwave and it was really hot so&nbsp;I spit it out back into his plate...he didn't like this so he took one of the scalding peperonis and stuck it to my face...I'm sure it will scare...  &nbsp;  We haven't talked&nbsp;much&nbsp;since then, but&nbsp;I did find him in my room messing with Frank...I think that&nbsp;might be his next angle...Flush&nbsp; the Fish...&nbsp;

      I told my mom that I was going out to buy some contact solution and she asked me to buy some paper towels while I was out. I asked why I should have to be the one to buy the paper towels and she said "just think of it as your contribution to the family." Well that got me thinking, I think I contribute plenty to the family. For one,&nbsp;I'm morning person and no one else in the family really is. So I bring all the cheer and sunshine of a new day straight from my heart to theirs every morning. The should appreciate that. On top of that, I always help us win the Christmas Card Race. Every year&nbsp;at Christmas&nbsp;my mom&nbsp;and her two sisters race to see which family can get the most Christmas cards. It's a lot of fun and we always win...why? Because of me...b/c the old people at church really like me, so I always get my own separate Christmas card from the family so we are getting double the cards. I'm sure I do more, but thats all I can think of right now...maybe&nbsp;I should go buy the paper towels...

      Man something really scary happened today. I went to go check on Frank, ya know the usual morning routine, feed him a lil, tap on his bowl a lil, say his name in&nbsp;a high pitched voice a lil. Well&nbsp;I went&nbsp;into my room only to discover that Frank was no where&nbsp;in his&nbsp;bowl. I was so worried! Could this be some&nbsp;sick joke my brother was playing&nbsp;on me? Could Frank finally have learned how to jump&nbsp;out of his bowl?(I'd been trying to teach him that one) Could he had not really loved me at all and had&nbsp;taken this opportunity to&nbsp;escape out the window?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Then I noticed a bit of orange under the rocks at the bottom of his bowl. Frank had buried himself under his rocks and was stuck! I freed him from his self inflicted trap and gave him a long lecture on "Bowl Decor Safety."

      After being harassed about not having a boyfriend at the neighborhood ice cream social this evening, and for the 50th time this summer by various old people,&nbsp;I began to think about what my dream guy would be like  &nbsp;  I'd want a tall guy at least 6 feet tall. Other than that&nbsp;I don't think I'd care much what he looked like as long as he's not horrendous.  &nbsp;  First and foremost&nbsp;he'd have to be a perfect&nbsp;gentleman. Open doors, pull out chairs, give me his jacket when he thinks I'm cold (that one gets me everything *sigh*). I'd&nbsp;want him to be funny, really funny. The kind of guy I could call up at 3 in the morning, just because I'm bored and&nbsp;I know he'd keep me laughing for the rest of the night.  &nbsp;  I'd want him to get along with my family. If he could get daddy to like him, he'd be a winner for sure. I need a guy who has common sense, b/c&nbsp;I have none. The kind of guy who makes sure&nbsp;I look both ways before crossing the street. The kind of guy I'd feel safe with no matter where we were or what we were doing...thats a must, a guy who makes me feel safe. I wouldn't want him to be overly protective or obessive,&nbsp;I need my space. But&nbsp;I'd want him to be there for me when I&nbsp;needed him.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'd like an older guy. It'd be nice if he fished, played golf, and pool. I'd like that. He'd have to know how to dance, or be willing to learn. We could swing together I'd like that a lot too. I want a guy who likes dressing up in a suit and tie, and I don't like boys in jeans.   He wouldn't have to be some macho man, but I'd like to think he'd fight for me if he had to, even if he got his butt kicked, as long as he did it for me. I wouldn't him to be high strung, a clam guy who would be comfortable with me and my obsession with the spot light.  &nbsp;  If anyone finds this fella, let me know, cuz I'm gonna marry him one day.

      I feel like a liar. See&nbsp;I went shopping today, and I saw this nifty looking panties, they were red and orange and looked like little boys underwear. they were cute so&nbsp;I had mom get them for me. When I got home and I was putting my clothes away and I noticed my new panties said "Track Star" on the back.&nbsp; I hadn't noticed this when I bought them. I'm no track star...I actually&nbsp;ran track my freshman year, but I was by no means a star, I&nbsp;was the slowest person on the team. And that is why I can never wear these underwear. I would feel like a liar all day long.

      I just talked about going to work with daddy when I was little&nbsp;and it reminded me going to work with mom when&nbsp;I was little. I liked taking trips with mom to work too.&nbsp; So she didn't have ice cream or anything like that...she had orange soda that was&nbsp;kinda&nbsp;good.  &nbsp;  Mom worked at this help hot line place...she was like the admistrative asst. I think, something like that.  &nbsp;  The difference of going to work with dad and mom was at Dad's work, he wouldn't really let me touch anything important. But mom man she didn't care...I could play with the typewriter (yes this was back in the old old days) and the copy machine, sometimes she'd let me use colored ink and colored paper. I loved those times. There a was a nice little bathroom there too, I liked that little bathroom it had a shower in it, I don't know why.  &nbsp;  Going to work with mom and dad, those are some of my favorite childhood memories.

      I like going to ice cream socials. I like ice cream, I like people, I like talking with people while eating ice cream. We are having an ice cream social today in the neighborhood to meet the new neighbors; I think this will be fun.  &nbsp; I doubt it will be as fun as the Coble Dairy Ice Cream Socials. Those are lots of fun! See Coble Dairy is the place&nbsp;daddy worked at when I was a little girl. I loved going to work with him back in the day. I would play in his desk drawers all day and then after we went to lunchhe'd take me to the place where they kept the ice cream and i'd eat some. Then we'd go around and visit all the old men named Steve...most of the people who worked there were named Steve...I think... &nbsp; Anyway, Pa had two secrataries and I like them a lot. One of them would take me to the bathroom when&nbsp;I had to pee, she was my favorite one. The other one was always scared that I would fall down the stairs. I didn't like her much she was too paranoid. Those were fun times though. &nbsp; Well&nbsp;anyway then the lil business closed down so every year after thatall the ppl get back together and have a little ice cream&nbsp;social. The ice cream isn't great but&nbsp;I like the people. They all talk about me when I just little bitty, and all the old men named Steve&nbsp;joke with daddy. I say they are his friends, but pa says he doesn't have any friends. &nbsp; In Conclusion... I like ice cream socials. One day when&nbsp;I old i might&nbsp;even host&nbsp;one!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Dr. Frank Tangerine is my fish. He is  gold . I call him Frank. Frank is a good fish one of my favorite so far. I've only had him for a few days but I know he loves me already. He gets excited and swims around when I tap on his lil bowl. Now I've killed many a goldfish in my day and never shed a tear, but I trying really hard not to kill Frank. Most of the time I overfeed my fish in an attempt to make them obese (I like fat pets). But I have learned that feeding the fish more will not make it fat...It will only make it have convulsions and die, so I only feed him twice a day...sometimes 3 times... I even took the time to buy him some rocks to put at the bottom of his bowl. I've never put so much effort in to a fish and I think he appreciates it. He likes to dig in his rocks and look at me while I'm sleeping. Yep me and old Frank are going to get along just fine!

      I like TV commercials a lot...Sometimes a  whole  lot. Like Starbucks. Man they have some great commercials. Seeing of them just makes me smile. VH1...they have some good ones too. But Radio commercials, that is a different story. I hate, with a passion that burn deep within my soul, radio commercials and I'm not sure why. They never did anything to me. Tonight I was taking a bath...it was a rough day and a nice hot bath can fix just about anything. So thats what I did...now when I am taking one of my relaxing baths&nbsp;I like to turn the shower radio on and listen to 99.5 because "Love Songs With Deliah" is on and&nbsp;I really enjoy that program. So when I turn the radio on I catch the very end of some song...then miss Deliah comes on and talks about what she will talk about next, then they go to commercial. That made me kind of sad b/c I don't particularly like to hear her talk...I just like the music. So&nbsp;I change the station only to find commercials on every other worth-while station; and by the time I get back to 99.5...she's gone back to commercial break again. My relaxing bath gave me a headache.

      I finally decided to create a blog spot. Why? The only reason&nbsp;I can think of is "becuase everyone else is." That makes me a little sad. Just a little. Watching "I Love the 90s" reminded me of all of our "bandwagon obsessions"&nbsp;when we were younger. So perhaps&nbsp;I don't want to be left out when we are in our 30s and talking about "yeah i remember my little blogs." Besides&nbsp;I do enjoy a good whine&nbsp;everynow and then...and this looks like the the perfect place to do it.    &nbsp;&nbsp;

      I like a lot of people. But there are very few people I have respect for. Manly for people who have "balls." Personally, if i had to choose I'd rather people respect me then like me. Ya know, I think thats why i think it would have been so cool to like a 1920s gangster. Those boys didn't play! When they said they were gonna bust a cap, they did. People didn't really like them much, but they sure did respect them. Very few people have balls these days, and thats a sad thing.

      So I was just sitting in the den looking for some stuff in my bookbag and mom has the TV on Court TV. She likes that mess I suppose. And the anchor lady starts to read a conversation between some lady and and some man. Now at one point in the conversation the old lady says GD. And the Anchor lady says the word. That really bugged me. But it bugged me even more when she said  "F'n" instead of the F word and just completly skipped over the S word. What makes it ok to say GD and F*** or S*** I'd rather hear either of those. Some stuff like that just really bugs the crap out of me.

      During 4th period, I went to CVS to pick up some pictures for yearbook. Whenever you spend money with the CVS card you have to take the recite to mrs. Bruff down in the office. So when we arrived back at school Amanda and I split up. She took the reciet and I headed up the ramp to take the pictures to the yearbook room. I started talk to talk to myself. I don't really know when. But I'm having a little conversation with myself as I travel along my way and I asked myself a little question idk what the question was. But someone answered me, So I look up and see Ben coming down the ramp.  "I wonder how long he heard me talking to myself" I think inside my insane little head, but I just smiled and hoped he thought I was talking to him, but he didn't and asked "who were you talking to?"  "Amanda!" I said even though I knew Amanda was long gone, and I traveled along my merry little way again. I was embarrassed, so I said "man I wonder how long he heard me." and I walked all the way to the yearbook room, having an out loud discussion with myself about the need to stop talking to myself in public. But Sadly...I'll probably do it again tomorrow.

      Last night us 4 amigos had poker night at my house. We bet real money, real live pennies! We were gonna smoke cigars, drink beer, spit, and cuss. None of that happened. The plan was to get more in touch with our manlyness. But in reality Lynette Amanda and me got the crap scared out of us and screamed like little girls. After that Amanda and me wailed love ballads at the top of our lungs, we all ate some pretzels, and nobody really took the poker game seriously. And after staying up late talking about boys, babys, bras, and other such girly subjects I went to sleep feeling like more a girly then ever. I like poker night!

      Here's my theory. Most guys like jeeps. Especially those 30 year old ones who are trying to grasps that last ounce of youth. So, thats why men in their mid to late 30s often hit on me. It's not really me, it the jeep. You pick the ones out that will hit on you. They get this look in their eyes and they start to stare. The kind of stare where you can really tell if they are looking at you or the car. Most of the time it's the car so they say something, like "Nice jeep" and then you say something like "Thanks old man" and then they realize that not only do they like the car, but the girl inside is probably young enough to get them sent to jail for at least 3 years. That's a big turn on. So then they say something like "Has anyone told you how pretty you look today?" So, you say something like "No, sir." you say sir, b/c you hope that it will remind them how much older they are then you. But no, they just think it's cute, so they say *smile* "so how old are you?" Then you say "I"m 16" and he says "oh, well that's a real nice car. Is it manuel or automatic." Here's where you win, because see, he's already turned off because you remind him how much of an old man he is. So here's the turning point, how you answer this next question is really important, because guys like girls who drive sticks. And even if you are 20 some years younger than him, the fact you can drive a stick would make him not care and he'd continue to pursue you. But like I said, in my case, here's where I win b/c I have an automatic. So I say "oh...It's automatic." So now he knows he can't have you...But that jeep sure is still appealing. "So, he'll say, those are hard to come by aren't they?" Then here is where you squash him. You say "Oh I wouldn't know, my daddy bought it for me." That reminds him that your father is probably his age and he should run home to his wife and kids and morgage and yard work and taxes instead of hanging out at gas stations trying to pick up little girls. That's my theory

      A bananna Slushie from the green gas station by walmart would surly make my life a better place to live in. I haven't been there in a few weeks. Partly because i haven't been anywhere since school started. And Partly because the last time i was there i was stalked by these two scary guys who wanted my number....appreantly "they just wanted to be friends" well thats what they told me, when i said i wasn't interested in dating them. Mom says i shouldn't go places alone, and sometimes i agree. I wish i had a big 300 pound guy to carry around in my pocket. I"d pull him out whenever someone bugged me and i would just be like "Get 'em Fred" (his name would be fred) and then Fred would eat them and hop back in my pocket.

It made me think, this guy must have been pretty passioante. I hope that before i die i can be as passionate about something as he was. Myabe he was just kidding when he said it, but it went down in history anyway...thats just as cool in my book though...

       Alone again tonight, Without someone to love. Stars are shining bright, So one more wish goes up. Oh I wish I may, And I wish with all my might, For the love I'm dreaming of, And missing in my life.  You'd think that I could find, A true love of my own. It happens all the time, To people that I know. Their wishes all come true, So I've got to believe, That there's still someone out there who, Is meant for only me.  I guess I must be wishin' on someone else's star, It seems like someone else keeps gettin' what I'm wishin' for. Why can't I be as lucky as those other people are? I guess I must be wishin'... on someone else's star  I sit here in the dark, And stare up at the sky. But I can't give my heart, One good reason why, Everywhere I look, It's lovers that I see. Seems like everyone's in love, Everyone but me.  I guess I must be wishin' on someone else's star,    It seems like someone else keeps gettin' what I'm wishin' for.    Why can't I be as lucky as those other people are?    I guess I must be wishin' on...    Someone else's star

I got up this morning it was great morning, I pulled into to school with a really good Rod Stewart song playing. I couldn't help but think today will be absolutely wonderful. But it wasn't. It wasn't a bad day by all means, but I suppose I'm just looking for something great to happen and chances are it won't. I feel really...idk...disconnected, from everyone.

        School, ruins you for life  Going Home the  real  long way to appease your slushie addiction is wrong  Not watching to road while drinking your slushie is a good way to die  Dorkyness runs in families  With enough time and hair spray  anything  is possible  I really do need a cowgirl hat  Some people consider being 30 minutes late fashionable  Some bathrooms are made for little people  There are rules for 4 ways stops  Sometimes people flip you off for no apparent reason  I honestly have no clue as to where I am going ever  Pa still yells at me about my driving  Lowes is a great place to pick up all shapes and sizes of middle aged men  Sometimes people honk at you for no apparent reason  Ma and Pa don't care how you dress as long as you bring back food  Pillow cases aren't really necessary  SiFi Channel really has some good movies   The book is always better  Staying up later does not prolong your weekend

      Our family doesn't really eat together much. Mom rarely cooks, dad works late a lot, and brother is really picky. Some people think it is a sad thing we don't have time to share meals together, I however see this a blessing in disguise.  We decided to go out to eat tonight. Brother is at a friends, so it is just me and ma and pa. We can never agree on anywhere to eat. See ma's three favorite places are the places I absolutely hate. Applebees, Golden Corral, and Capitan Stevens. I'd rather not eat then eat at one of those places. Sadly, though ma always gets her way, and although pa and I wanted to get some pizza and hot wings or go out of lovely Lexington and eat somewhere in Winston maybe. But Ma made us eat at dreaded Golden Corral.  On the way in pa sees a man he used to work with. He was in line behind us and got the senior buffet. Pa later told us, he was only 37. That made me laugh a great deal.  Our waitress was a little old lady. I always feel sad for little old ladies working. Not this one though, because she only came to fill up my glass once. And God Forbid you use Bar-B-Que sauce on your chicken fingers because you get like a tiny little cup full. That doesn't even cover one chicken finger. But you can't ask for more when the old lady waitress never comes back.  So then we leave. But ma realizes she forgot her pocket book on the way to the car. So pa goes back to the table to get it and the waitress then asks him "Were you with her?" Pa just laughed and said "yeah for the past 20 some years." Can't blame her though, she didn't come to the table enough to remember us.  This was a   very   tame dinner out for our family. I'm sure I"ll have a good story one day soon.

      So I didn't get hit by a bus or anything today. That was good. I decided to wear my hair curly. That wasn't good.  That Mr. Weaver, he's a character, I like him.  Then I had math class. We got a new seating chart today. There isn't much help surrounding me.  Then Digital Media, it was very boring today, but watching Mr. Brunson drink 4 cups of coffee in 45 minutes made it worth my while.  Then Mr. Fink, this class is going to be really boring, and I love history. It won't be too very bad because the Jeff guy sitting beside me, although I can't hear him very well, seems kinda funny. Somehow he can hear the smart butt comments I make under my breath and he laughs. Yeah I think he'll keep me entertained.  then lunch, I have all of 10 minutes to eat because of the stupid freshman. They were breaking today! when iw as a freshman I cowered in the back until everyone taller then me had gotten their food. Well everyone is still taller than me, but I refuse to be in the back this year. I'm a F'n Junior!  then yearbook. I almost died on that stupid slippery floor again today. I think it makes Ben happy to know one of us will end up breaking a limb thanks to him. I know it would make me happy. Watching 3 idiots. (it seems Me, Amanda, and Kayli are the only ones who ever slip) go running around all day long and then one day just fall flat out on the floor and have to go to the hospital. I would probably like to know I had a part in that. I hope someone will bring me flowers.  I had a little trouble pulling out of my parking place today. Apparently the 2 people who park beside me never leave school. Their cars are there when I get there and there when I leave. I almost ran over a boy backing out. I didn't care too much.  Mom caught me talking to my self on my way in the door. I was kinda embarrassed so I just told her I was singing. Then I went to take my 30 minute afternoon nap, and ended up sleeping till 6 o'clock, I feel really bad. but the medicine wil kick in soon.

      I woke up 20 minutes b4 my alarm clock went off at 6:45. I layed in bed until 6:44. Got up and flipped the alarm clock switch just as it was starting to go off. I hate the couns of alarm clocks. I put on a shirt and walked to the bathroom. I noticed 2 zits on my face..great I hadn't had a zit in months, but two of them decide to pop out today. Thats ok though, the lazy eye wasn't so bad this morning so I was happy. I did the Bathroom Stuff Part 1 (pee, brush teeth, check lazy eye, etc.) and went back to my room to dress.  skirt...tank top...Button down...flip flops...ear rings... all done...make up time  so I head to bathroom for Bathroom Stuff Part 2, (contacts, make up, hair, etc.) Fought with brother a little, talked to mom a little, it's 7:30 time to go.  It's going to be a GREAT year I say as I pull out of my street without checking for traffic. Then I see the bus coming and swerve off the road a little. After my heart stopped pounding, I decided the near death incident would make for a good lunch story...that is if I had anyone to eat lunch with.  I was glad I left a little early because it took my 15 minutes to get into the parking lot because of all the traffic...I thought about Valerie who I'd imagined was just getting out of bed...  I pulled into my Junior Class President parking space with ease. That made me happy. I walked into school said hey a few ppl and saw Amanda and Michael sitting almost exactly where we all sat last year. I was glad. Amanda and I walked up to the yearbook room to get batteries for the camera Ben gave me which had no batteries. The room was locked so we left. It was during our jouney back to the commons that I realized my flip flops were very loud and annoying.  Then the homeroom bell rang so I walked with Sarah to mr. weaver's class. I tried to make friends with a girl sitting by herself...but she didn't want to be friends.  then I went to 1st period which was now math b/c my schedule got changed this morning. I saw Ellen walking in the same room and me and I squealed loudly, everyone in the class looked at me and I felt like and idiot. I sat down and the time passed quickly. It worries me that no one in the class looks smarter than me. Who am I gonna copy?  I found out I had second lunch! That means I get to eat with my "band nerd" friends that really made me happy, idk what I'd do without my best friends at lunch.  Next period was Digital Media with Brunson,I was kinda scared about this class, but it is gonna be awesome!  Then US History with Mr. Fink, I don't like the fact he said "I know this is a regular class, but I do want you to learn a little something." it made me feel like an idiot. I didn't really have any friends in that class. Jo Ann is across the room. Jason Smith is beside me, we talked a little about math classes. Ben Robinson is in front of me, he's nice guy when you talk to him, I reminded myself not to laugh too much at his jokes, because I always forgot not to on world history last year and he would talk all through class some days. there is a guy named jeff sitting on the other side of me...I think he'll be nice, he talks to quietly though, so I mostly just nodded and smiled at him. History won't be so bad.  Lunch, I was glad to see everybody.  then yearbook, same old same old I guess. Ben sprayed stuff on the floor and I almost fell down and died. I get to be the "marketing person" next year I think that will be fun. I stayed after for about 15 minutes to finish up the board I started making.  Then I returned to red boarder to the library and went home. It wasn't anything great. But it was my day.

      I am not a good driver. Those of you who have been unfortunate enough to ride with me know this well. Well I had just gotten my hair cut, and I was kinda ill b/c I hated it anyway, so I just want a cheese burger that all. So I pull next door to Lexington style Trimmings and pull into a parking place up front. I am not a good parker.  So I park way too close to the truck beside me, but I am like ya know it's ok I can squeeze out so I am getting out of the car and the restaurant door opens up. There is this guy, probably about 19 or 20, I thought man he looks like a cocky "A" hole and little did I know he really was! So he is like "Hey Excuse me!" I was like "yeah?" thinking what is this "A" holes problem. Then he says "I'm about to get into that truck, is there anyway you could park a lil farther away." I was pretty close, so I was like "Yeah, no problem, sorry about that." He said "oh it's fine, thanks sweetheart,"  I really hate that! People I don't know that call me sweetheart. So I'm really ill at the "A" Hole who could have squeezed by, but I get in my car and put it reverse.  So I back out straight and the guy gets in his car, then he proceeds to give me thumbs up signal out of the window. "Good job babe!" Oh no he did not just do that I think inside my head and promote him to "F'n" "A" Hole. I smile sarcastically, but while I am thinking about giving him the finger I realize I am about to hit the car behind me so I push all the pedals and move the gear in every direction all at once. The car doesn't like this and it just turns off. It takes me a minute to get it fixed. Shut I finally do and pull back into the parking lot.  Now during any of this the "F'n" "A" Hole could have left, but he didn't and when I pull back in the parking space he says "was the stick giving you some trouble?"  I don't have a stick shift, my jeep is automatic, but I was like whatever and just said "Yeah."  He said "aww that's so cute."  I made a face at him.  "Well you'll get better at it maybe one day honey." then he pulled out of the parking space. I seriously thought about following him to his house and kicking him in the balls. I didn't though, I just went in and ate my cheesebuger and had a good laugh about the "F'n" "A" Hole...Because I realized that in my head I was actually calling him the "F'n" "A" Hole. I wasn't saying the words...I couldn't even cuss in my head and that makes me pretty "F'n" mad! "D" it

      I stopped my car in the middle of the road on the way home from the country store because the sun was so pretty. It was big and orange and it was gonna make me have wreck so I just stopped and looked at it for about 10 minutes until a car came up behind me. I wanted to go outside when I go home, but I forgot that you can't see the sun set in the summer time from our yard because of the trees inbetween our yard and the neighbors. You can only see it if you are upside down. I know this because when I was little girl and we had a swing set in the back yard I would go out side during the summer time when daddy was mowing the grass and I would hang upside down because that was the only way you could see the sun over the trees. And the sky would turn pink and purple and red and orange and I never wanted to grow up. Because you couldn't see the sun unless you you were hanging upside down. I think I cried the day daddy took my swing set down.

      Moments of enlightenment are what I call them. When for a brief second you get a glimpse of the "real" someone. You see a tiny bit of what really makes them tick and you know that they didn't mean for you to see it, and the quite possibly might not even know that you saw it. (there is something under my foot...I"ll what it is in a minute...I hope it doesn't bite) Now you have the moments of enlightenment really anytime, and it can come from just a simple comment someone makes or an expression on their face that's helps you to see them in a little bit of a new light. (It's duck tape, I have more to say but now that I have duck tape I should probably go find something to fix...it is my duty to the south.)

      This really has been the best summer ever. There may have been a summer there between 3rd and 4th grade that was better but I can't really remember, so I'll just call this one the best summer ever. I found the country store. I made about $500. I wasted about $400. I still have $100 more to waste and 2 days to do it in life is sweet. I got a tan, and grew a half inch. I made some new friends and had a few really good laughs. I kept my cell phone battery charged every day and I stayed up late every night. I made a few mistakes. I didn't break anything worse than a nail and had a completely clear complexion for 2 months, and I had at least one adventure a week. I didn't fight with brother much, and the dog and I have started getting along. even if Tress and Frank died, pa is in the process of getting me a new kitty and, well I can get a new goldfish anytime I want, I just have to think of a new name for him. So all in all It's been the Best Summer Ever  Thanks for your help in the process!

      I really do enjoy going to church, but not really for the reasons you might think. Now don't get me wrong, I like the prayer and worship part...but for the most part I can do that on my own. Mom said she used to work with a man who was an atheists but had been an active member in his church for 30 or so years. When she asked him why, he said because of the fellowship. I can really understand that, because I like going to church for manly 3 reasons.  I talking to the like the people, mainly the old people. I like the music. and I like to laugh about the people and music. Let me explain. Well lets just take a look at church today. 1st of all let me explain some things about our church. We have 2 services, the casual with coffee and doughnuts, and the formal which really isn't formal at all, very few of the men wear suits and a lot of the women wear pants. We go to the formal service. Also, we just got a new preacher at the beginning of this month.  Ok now back to church this morning. Pa wasn't feeling well so he didn't go with us...it was me mom and brother...Ok so we arrive around 11:45 so we have 15 minutes until the service starts, someone sat behind us and asked how I liked the new preacher. It is church so I tried to honest. "I don't like him much," I say, "he makes us stand up too much and he doesn't let us shake hands long enough." Mom flicked me on the arm. So then I visit with a few of my favorite old people. One tells me she's been praying for me everynight since I started driving, I told her I appreciated that because I really needed those prayers. She looked a little worried and I liked that.  So then church starts, and since this new preacher changed the order of things around we do the little shake hands part as one of the 1st things. I really don't like that, because b4 that was kinda like your break, stand up streach a little. I just talked to these people I don't wanna talk to them again already. But the shaking hands part is my favorite because you get to talk to all the people, so someone was telling mom how proud she should be of me and she was giving the usual "we are proud of  both  our children speech. The choir starts singing, we had like 5 minutes to shake hands. Thats just not right, you can't even squeeze out of the pew in 5 minutes. So all the old crippled people are trying to hobble back their seats and everyone else is sitting down, and the song finishes and he informs us that we shouldn't sit down now and to stand back up. "I'm not standing up agian, he should have let me shake hands longer." mom flicked me and so I stood up. Well he reads something out of the bible and then he Said open your hymns to blah blah blah and we start singing. Now our church choir is made up of the same people who have been singing in it since 1950. They sing everything about 2 beats slower then it is supposed to be sung. I like that a lot...it gives us character. Most of the normal people in the pews don't like singing much, and I like to watch as little by little people get bored with the song and close their hymnals.  Now pa and I have a game we like to play in church, Who Can Make The Preacher Laugh First. It keeps us entertained anyway and although we've never made one actually laugh, we have succeeded in haveing him crack a smile and refuse to look in our direction for the rest of the sermon. Thats a win in my book. We'll since Pa wasn't there I felt it was my duty to try my luck on the new guy. So I made a goofy smile and just stared at him through the whole song. He didn't notice. Mom did and she flicked me.  A few minutes later the preacher was coming down from the platform to give the children message and he tripped. I started laughing, loudly, mom started flicking away and so I got it under control real fast.  When it was time to go, I had to go to the bathroom, so I was heading out the door trying to hurry before anyone wanted to start talking. I ran into the older man who likes to hug everyone several times a Sunday. He stopped me and hugged me he said "Good to see ya Courtney!" "Thanks I said good to see you too!" "you haven't been here much this summer." he said "No sir," I said, "I almost didn't make it today!" then I headed for the bathroom. I really like church, it brightens my day!

      Today i decided i wanted to wear my white shorts tomorrow but I discovered they were dirty, so i said hey ma can you wash my shorts...she said no but you can...come on I'll show you how. So she did, i dedcied i would use some blech b/c that makes things very white (the shorts were white don't worry). But anyway so i washed the clothes with lots of blech, now my shorts, my white tank top, 3 pairs of panties, my stupid socks and my favorite bra all smell like a swimming pool and it kinda make me sad.
