       I received this email recently from  urlLink TCSSC :    It is with extreme frustration and embarrassment with our members that we write to you today regarding games at Fieldstone Day School (Lawrence/Dufferin) from last week.   On Monday and Tuesday night of last week, TCSSC members urinated in the sandbox and other nearby areas prior to and during their games at Fieldstone. The sandbox is used as a play area for students. School officials spotted these individuals first-hand and immediately brought the health and safety issues to our attention. As a result, Fieldstone has issued a final warning to the TCSSC.   Fortunately, the school will be allowing us to continue using the field in the near future. As a condition for this, the TCSSC has had to (1) replace the sand in the sandbox, and (2) install a "port-o-potty" on site. A padlock will remain on the door - the combination is 21-35-13 (this will also be posted at the location description for Fieldstone at our website). The port-o-potty will be serviced on a weekly basis; combined with the padlock, it will be suitable for the needs of our members for washroom needs.   After I read this, my first reaction was "What is wrong with these people? Have they no common decency?" Then I realize something, there are NO washrooms at any of the outdoor fields we play at, and our games last 1 1/2 hour. So what's one to do when nature calls? I am not saying that it was right to urinate everywhere, but TCSSC should really reconsider the kind of facilities they are providing.

       Last night over at my boss' house, his wife offered to do my laundry so I would have clean clothes to wear today. I was too quick to accept. What happened? Since they didn't really have any clothes for me to change into, I ended up having to wear only a bathrobe the whole night.   We were watching TV, then things took a weird turn. A hot steamy makeout scene. So there I was, sitting there in my bathrobe, next to my boss and his wife, feeling extremely uncomfortable, thinking " Oh man, please let this end, when is this going stop !" Let me tell you I was so glad when that was over. Whew.   Now here's a thought: what would be worse, being with your parents when that happen, or being with your boss and his/her spouse?

       Recently, someone pointed out a very strange thing that has been happening to me.   For my last three dining experience, after I've placed my order, the waiter/waitress has suggested something else, and for all three times I have taken in their suggestions.   At Ruby Tuesdays, I ordered a coke and ended up getting a Mega-rita (see Niagara photos)   At Dave & Buster's, I ordered a Caesar and ended up getting a Margarita.   At Moxie's, I ordered mashed potatoes and I ended up getting a stuffed potato.   Why do the servers always pick me out? Because of my bad choice of meals? Because I have the word “pushover” written all over my face? I mean... this doesn't happen to anyone else at the same table. I don't understand.
