       Weekend  I had a good weekend, spending time with friends, and welcoming back the guys from India.   It was a laid back weekend, I didn't have anything I absolutely had to do, and so I was able to just go with the flow.   I'm really enjoying the change in my lifestyle, the ability to change my plans, the freedom to do what I want when I want to. Is that a selfish attitude? In some ways I think that it is.  It feels like recently my life was on hold. I was spending all my time working, and trying to create a life for my wife and I, trying to make the marriage work. It eventually became apparent that I was the only one who was trying to make things work, and so eventually it ended. This has meant that I can pick up my life again, spend time with my friends, and do the things that I like to do. I feel much better in myself at the moment, things are starting to come right, and the pressures and stresses of last year are beginning to ease.  Seeing the India team sharing on Sunday night was great. It was really good to hear about their experiences,and the high points of the trip. Over the next few months they will be sharing individually about their experiences, and I will update with what they have to say.

       They're back!!!  Our team of missionaries returned from India on Sunday morning. It was great to have them back safe and sound, and I'm really looking forward to hearing all about what they saw and did.  The friend I mentioned a while ago as having problems is doing well. She sorted things out with her mum, went back to work, and things are looking up.  In two weeks I go back to Teachers College. I'm excited, but also nervous as this semester is going to be a hard one, as I have to repeat some papers I didn't complete last semester when things were going wrong. I'll be glad to get back into the study and get my brain going again. It may even improve some of my posts!!

       Encouraging!   The other night I was watching the late news, and there was an interview with Brooke Fraser, New Zealand's latest singing star. The interviewer asked About Brooke being a Christian, and asked her whether this impacted on her music, and how.  Brooke Fraser's reply was that if being a Christian didn't impact on every part of her life, then there wasn't much point in being a Christian.  I thought this was a wonderful statement to make, and felt that it needed to be shared

       It wasn't a miracle, just one moment   Continuing the story of training for my new career, this is an experience from my first practicum, last year.  There was one boy in the class I just couldn't connect with. Unlike the others, who welcomed me, and cooperated with my requests, this one resisted. He was a real tough guy, one of the three who were always vying for the top dog position. As such, there was no way he was going to cooperate with any student teacher.  Near the end of my second (and last) week in the school, I was taking a language lesson with a group that included this child. After reading a story in a School Journal, I asked the children to retell the story as though it was a newspaper article.   Having set the task, I wandered around, helping the kids, and keeping an eye on their progress. I noticed that he wasn't writing. I checked that he knew the task, and moved on again. When I came back, I found that he had still not written anything.  I crouched down beside him, and together we worked through the task. He found that despite what he had first thought, he did know what to write. He eventually produced a great story, and both I, and the classroom teacher, were impressed.  I'd like to say that this was a huge breakthrough, and that he and I got on wonderfully for the rest of the week. I'd like to say that he became a model student. Unfortunately, this is the real world, and he was in trouble with his teacher five minutes later for misbehaviour.  But it was one moment, where I made a connection, where I felt that yes, I could do this job, and even more important, that this was where I wanted to be. Up to that point I had still been having doubts about teaching, and this experience proved to me that I was in the right place.   Someone told me that this is the payoff in teaching, those moments, and you grab them and treasure them when they come your way. I will certainly treasure that moment.

       When God wants you somewhere, you go!   Last year I started Teacher's College, which was a big step for me. I've always said I'd never teach, because both my parents are teachers, and seeing and hearing about what they went through, really put me off. Even though over the years many people have told me I should teach, it just wasn't something I felt I wanted to do.  Over the years I have felt little nudges from God, as if to say, "this is what want you to be doing with your life". This came in the form of friends, and people at church, telling me I should be teaching, and just a feeling, like you get when you know something is right. Even though I felt God's 'nudge', I was happy with what I was doing, and I resisted.  Early last year I started a new job, as a Checkout Manager, a step up from what I had been doing, and a new challenge, which I felt ready for. After prayer, and careful consideration, it seemed to be the right move to make, so I went. The job was a challenge, and one I found I was not enjoying. The hours were long, the task hard, and I began to doubt if I was up to it. Eventually I decided this wasn't the place for me. Again a little voice seemed to be saying to me "Teach. That is the gift I gave you, use it".  I thought about it, and decided to apply. I sent in an application, and said to God, "you want me to teach... Make it happen".  He works fast. I sent my application in two weeks before the start of the second semester, thinking that I would not hear anything until 2004. Not so! The Thursday before the semester was to start, I got a phone call. Someone had pulled out, could I come in for an interview on Friday? I went in, and within an hour of walking onto the college campus, I was enrolled, and due to start on the Monday!  People hearing that story say that I was lucky to get accepted that fast. I know what it was, and luck had nothing to do with it.

       Valentines Day? What, again already?   Here we go again, my least favorite day of the year is almost upon us again. I've never thought that much of Valentine's day, right back from when I first knew what it was. It has always seemed to me to be over commercialism, flower prices go up, shops are overrun with chocolates, cards and all sorts of gift ideas.   If we care about someone, are we not meant to show that person our love all the time? Why do we wait for one day of the year to say it?  As I said, I've never really liked Valentine's Day, because I think, like many others, that it is designed to make singles feel uncomfortable. Through my teen years I never celebrated it, largely because as a somewhat geeky teen, I never had anyone to send a card to! But at that time of the year, when everyone around me was celebrating, and spending time with the one they 'loved', I was acutely aware that I didn't have someone in my life who was that special to me.  This year will be the first Valentine's Day in 5 years that I will be on my own. You see, at the end of last year, my marriage of three years ended. We were dating for two years before we married, so for 5 years I was one of those out buying cards and flowers every February 14th, and doing the whole couple thing.  As I think about the upcoming day, I feel sad, because the feelings and the hurt are still really raw, and I really don't need a reminder that I'm alone, not just at the moment.  So, I've made plans to spend that evening with two really good friends. I know that they will understand if I'm not my usual self that night, if I seem a little down. But I know that being with them, sharing good times with them, will help me to remember that life goes on, and that even though I have lost one part of my life, there is much more that I still have.

       Thank you for friends   Last year was a difficult year for me, I'd have to say one of the most difficult I have faced. From where I was at the start of the year, married, and in a job I really enjoyed, to the end, separated, and training for a totally new career, via a huge emotional roller coaster, which still continues.  Even now, I still have days when I feel really down, days when I want to crawl into a hole and hide from everyone. On other days, I feel fine, happy and secure, and looking forward to the challenges and events in store for me this year. At the moment, the good days pretty much outnumber the bad, but some weeks it is a close game.  The thing that has kept me going through the tough times, as well as my reliance on God, is some very close, and very understanding friends. It took me reaching a real low point to realise how much my friends cared, and that had I just told them how I was feeling, they would have been there for me.  Now, I can't go more than I day without contacting people, before someone will call and ask how I am, or drop round. At first this annoyed me, I thought "I don't need them to check up on me all the time", but then I realised that it was because they care, and don't want to lose me.  The best friends though, are the ones who are there when I need to talk, or want some advice, but who also know when I just want some space to myself. The ones who don't claim to know how I'm feeling, don't tell me what I need to do, or what they think I need to hear, but who listen, accept that today I am sad, tomorrow I may be angry, and who knows how I'll feel by Wednesday!  I am fortunate to have friends who are like this, and I thank them, and God, that they are who they are, and that they care.

       What do I tell you, when you turn to me for advice?   A friend of mine is having problems at the moment, in a lot of areas of her life. She's recently left a violent relationship, and she's having some quite serious health problems. Recently, she had a fight with her mother, and moved out of home.  She was texting me on Friday night, at first just saying she was having a hard time, but not wanting to say why, and then gradually opening up, and letting me know what was going on. I did the best I could to reassure her, to tell her that life would get better. She felt like no one would notice if she made a clean break, just disappeared and started again somewhere else.  I don't always know what to say to people in these times. I want to be able to tell them that it will all work out for them, that life will settle down again. I want to tell them that God has His plan for their life, and He knows what is best. The trouble is, sometimes I have trouble believing this about my own life and circumstances, let alone about anyone else's. As much as I want to accept that God is in control of things, and that everything that happens is to His purpose, when things hurt, when I feel myself at the bottom, taking another kick in the teeth, I find it hard to reconcile the image of a loving father with the situation I find myself in.  I guess I'm not the only one who finds myself wondering. Its not that I doubt God's love for me, its just that when the pain comes, I wonder why He lets it happen, how this can be for my benefit.  What do you think? I'd love to hear your views.

       Home Group   Last night I was having an online conversation with a girl who was a member of a youth home group I used to lead. Because of work, I had to stop leading this group in the middle of last year, and I have missed the people in the group.  When I started leading the group I was not sure what I was doing, I had no experience, and felt way out of my depth. For quite a while I tried my hardest to get the kids to listen to studies, to do the stuff I wanted them to do, and I got no response. I wondered why, wondered what I was doing wrong. Didn’t they like me? Did I not know how to lead a group? Did others have this problem? I was on the point of giving up leading, handing it on to someone with more experience.   Then I went to a youth leader’s training weekend, and talked to other youth leaders. To my amazement, and relief, I discovered that other people were having the same difficulties I was. From then, I changed my approach. Rather than concentrating on what I had planned, and my agenda, I started to listen to the members of the group more, tried to see where they were at, and what was going on in their lives. I concentrated on building relationships with them, on being there for them, and encouraging them to know that they could talk to me about anything.  Last night, one of the kids was asking my advice on something she was facing. It was great to be asked, to have her feel that she could approach me with concerns. It has taken a while to get to that point, but all the work I put in is worth it, when someone comes to you for advice.  What am I trying to say here? I guess my advice to anyone who is working with youth, or with anyone, is that it may seem sometimes like you are getting nowhere, like they don’t listen to a word you are saying, but stick with it, one day the work may pay off, when you least expect it

      Today was a great day at college. I had a long break between classes, and my class decided that we would have a picnic on the grass by the library. It was really good to spend the afternoon with the class, getting to know each other a bit better. The variety of ages and experience in the class makes it really interesting. They're a great bunch of people, and I'm going to really enjoy this semester.  On another subject, I found out yesterday that our Youth Pastor is going to a new church, leaving in May. He's been with us for coming up to 4 years. He's going to a job that will be full time, instead of the half time that our church has been able to give him. So, for him it is a good decision, especially since his wife has family down there, but for the rest of us it feels a bit uncertain. At the moment we don't know who will be replacing him, or what will happen, so things there are a bit up in the air.

        I'm baaaaackkkkkk!!!   I'm back at Teacher's College this week, and it is so good to be back and starting to use my brain again!  I've got a good group of people in my classes, with a wide range of ages and experiences, so it will be a good environment to learn in.  What is really encouraging is the number of guys training. This is a big problem in New Zealand schools, that there is a huge shortage of male teachers. It is really good to see so many guys starting training this year.  And, on an unrelated note, how cool is Lord Of The Rings?! Go Peter Jackson, go the Hobbits! And, as I commented to  urlLink Rachel  when watching the movie, the waistcoats were outstanding!

         The picture above is of my God-daughter Natalia. She turned six at the end of last year (one day before my birthday, so that's always kind of special).  When my friend asked me to be a Godparent I felt honoured, and at the same time a little scared. What did I know about children, about how to help raise them? Because of the circumstances my friend is in, I spend a lot of time with her and Natalia, just being there, being an adult male in her life.   Now that I am studying teaching, and learning more about how children learn, and the things that affect them, I realise that everything I say or do around Natalia may have a profound impact on her life. It shows me that more than ever before that I have an important role in her life, and makes me very conscious of my actions.  Some day I want to have children of my own. Right now though, I don't think I would be ready for the huge responsibility that being a parent is, and I have to take my hat off to my friend who is doing this on her own.

       Busy week, more ahead....   Not many posts this week as I try to keep my head above water with my assignments. I finished one today, but have two more due next week. This weekend though will be a study free zone as I spend time catching up with friends. Tomorrow night I'm going ten pin bowling with a group of friends to celebrate my flatmate Mike's birthday. It will be interesting, because as with most sports I have two levels of play, I either have a great game, or a complete disaster!  Hopefully also on Monday I will play the pool challenge which has been postponed many times. A friend of mine, Andy, and I challenged two friends of ours to a game of pool a while ago, in a moment of great (and quite possibly misplaced) confidence. Now the time has almost come for us to back up our words with actions. Many of our friends are keen to see this, as they think (or hope) that Andy and I will suffer a humiliating defeat.

       Good friends   Today I had lunch with my friend Ali, who got back from Saudi Arabia yesterday, and her boyfriend Dave. She's been overseas for the past year, and before that I hadn't seen much of her for a while, we'd mostly communicated by email. So it was really great to see her again in person. We spent a good couple of hours chatting, catching up on family news, and just enjoying being in each other's company once again. Ali is one of my best friends, because she has always been there for me when I've needed her support. She has always been there to offer me advice when I've asked, and even when I don't listen to her, and do my own thing and stuff up, she doesn't say 'I told you so', she just helps me sort out my life again. I am so thankful that I have such good friends in my life, people who care about me no matter what the circumstances. I am really lucky in that way.

       The coming week.....   Sees me going back to college after a long holiday. It will be a shock going back to getting up early again, as I'm not a morning person by nature. But it will be good to get back to classes and see my classmates again. Lots of assignments coming up, although this year, for the first time ever, the different centres are making an effort to ensure that assignments are not all due at the same time. Previously each subject area sets their assignment dates without regard to anyone else, and students end up with multiple assignments due in the same week, and sometimes on the same day. Makes life that bit more exciting!  I'll also be catching up with a friend of mine who will be back from a year working as a nurse in Saudi Arabia. The situation at times over there has given me cause for concern, so I am very much relieved that she is still safe, and will be returning. She has been a friend since I was about 15 and going out with her best friend, (and she was seeing my best friend) and even though those relationships didn't last, the friendship that we have formed has lasted.  We've always been able to talk about anything, and on many occasions have provided support for each other. At many times other friends have asked us why we never got together, and the answer is simple. The friendship that we have, the ability to share things and get advice and support, is more important to us than a possible romantic relationship might be.  Finally on this week's social calendar, my flatmate Mike's birthday is next Tuesday, and a group are going bowling on Saturday night.

       Night Out   Had a great night out with some guys from church last night. I finished work at 9:30, and then we went out and had a late supper - love those 24 hour restaurants!, Then played pool, and finally watched a DVD. We didn't finish up till about 3 am, but it was a good night, and good to spend some time with friends. Needless to say, I'm a little tired today!

       Today I'm....   Not really up to much. Just listening to music, surfing the net, and trying to motivate myself to do some assignment work. I've been on holiday since two weeks  before Easter, and I haven't picked up a book in that time! I need to get back into it, or next week is going to be a real shock to the system! Not much chance of getting much done tonight as I have a friend coming over to burn a CD of some camp photos.

       Perspective  Sometimes I just can't think of things to write about. I feel like every post should be about something important, so if there isn't anything major happening, I don't post anything.   I guess I don't have to stress so much, and I can just post about whatever I'm feeling, or whatever minor event is the catastrophe of the day.  It seems to me that when I was a teenager, and writing a daily journal, I never had a shortage of earth-shaking and life or death situations to write about. Of course, when I look back at the entries now, somehow they aren't so life or death. I can even laugh about some of them now, things that I thought at the time were the end of the world.  I guess that perspective changes. Often when I'm at work, talking to people there (being in a supermarket most of the staff are students), they will be talking about the huge problems in their lives, things like who is dating who, what movies are on, or how they afford new jeans  and  top up their cellphone! I have at times said to them that they don't know what problems are.   Talking to a classmate last year, at the height of all the stresses in my life, she said that my situation made her problems seem insignificant. In some ways I agreed, but I also said that when we are in the middle of a situation, whatever it may be, to us it is the most important thing, and to say that someone else's problems are insignificant is to belittle their concerns.  This is why my issues of teenage angst, the financial concerns of my co-workers, and the heavier issues of my day to day life, are all important. Although to someone outside the situation it may seem trivial, when you are in the centre of something, it can be overwhelming.  So when people, especially youth group people, talk to me about what is going on in their lives, I try to look at it from their perspective. I try to put myself in their place, to understand what they are going through. In some ways all the stuff that I have been through has made that an easier ask, because I actually  have  been there!  Perspective is important, viewing issues from the point of view of someone else, and helping them to see it from another angle, maybe so it doesn't seem so big

       Reconnecting   I mentioned in an earlier post that I had an awesome time at Easter Camp. Awesome is a word I try not to use too often, because to me that word is reserved for something from God. But it is the only word that could describe the way I experienced God over that weekend.  As I have mentioned previously, my wife and I separated at the end of last year, and it appears unlikely that there will be any reconciliation. For a long time I have been down about this, especially as the end of my marriage also meant the end of other aspects of my life. I had to give up my position on the leadership of my church, and people have been reluctant to use me in other areas of ministry. In most cases this has been more out of not wishing to overload me, but some people I think have not wanted me involved because of the impression it would give. Certainly this was the case with my leadership role.  I was concerned that my involvement with youth ministry was going to be at an end. I hadn't been able to lead a small group for some time, because of my work hours, and now that my work situation meant I had the time, my personal circumstances seemed to exclude me.  I felt like God was not going to be able to use me anymore, that my usefulness was at an end.  Another concern I had was that I had lost a lot of my trust in others. I used to give people the benefit of the doubt, people would have my trust unless they showed that they didn't deserve it. Now, I don't trust people until they earn it. In a lot of ways I have found my heart has hardened, and it wasn't something I liked.  At Easter Camp one of the speakers was a youth pastor whose wife had had an affair, resulting in divorce. This guy went through the same issues I had been dealing with, feeling that his ministry was over, that his usefulness to God was at an end, and at one point even felt as though he wished his life was over. As he was speaking, I was amazed. It was as though he was outlining my life, going through all the things I was feeling. It was as though God was using him to talk directly to me. He went on to explain that God still has a Plan A for my life, that He is still able to use me.   He also talked about faith, about how your faith when times get tough is more important in God's eyes than your successes or failures. Listening to this started me thinking, and opened my eyes. And this was only the first day of the camp! How much more was God going to challenge me?

       Does that not make sense, or is it just me?   Listening to the news the other day, I heard a statement that made me stop and listen harder. It was a statement made by the Israeli government, to the effect that they had a Hamas leader assassinated, in order to heighten the peace process.  Now, I don't pretend to understand the full intricacies of the situation between Israel and Palestine, I don't claim to know who is in the right, if anyone is, but I fail to see how killing another person, in an airstrike on their car, is going to enhance any sort of peace process. When you then hear that the Hamas group has vowed to retaliate 100 times over (i.e. by killing 100 Israelis) I think it is fair to say that the peace process has not been enhanced.  It seems to me that if there is to be any sort of peace, then both sides have to take a look at their commitment to the process. They both need to step back, say 'enough retaliation' and actually sort out their issues, without killing each other. I'm not so naive that I think it will happen instantly, but as long as government sanctioned murder takes place, it ain't gonna happen at all

       Lots of stuff   First of all, thanks to those who have commented on my issues with forgiveness. It really helps to have some different perspectives and viewpoints.  Today I spent some time with the group that went to Easter Camp. We spent a bit of time talking about what happened over the camp, and how our weeks have been since we got back. It was great to talk to these young guys and girls, and listen to them talking about the way God is working in their lives. Its really encouraging. I've been sort of sidelined in the Youth Ministry at my church recently, as I have come to grips with some of the things that have been going on on my life, and I am now getting the opportunity to slowly get back into it. I'm really glad that I haven't lost my enthusiasm for youth work, its an area I've always loved to be in involved with.  Also today, after our more serious discussion, we went for a soccer game in the Auckland Domain. I hadn't realised how unfit I was!! I knew I wasn't in the best shape, but man.....! What happened to the guy who could run a seven minute mile only as few years ago? (and that guy had more hair too!) I actually managed to touch the ball a few times, and almost scored a goal, so I had fun, but it shows that I have to get myself back into shape. At least now I'm not smoking anymore, so that's a start!

        Things I'm wondering   The biggest thing I'm wondering about right now involves forgiveness. I know that I am supposed to forgive, not just once, but as many times as it takes. Even though that can be hard, I know that its what God wants me to do, and I'm willing to do that, but I have another question.  Once you have forgiven a person, do you still have to let them into your life again. to do the same things to you? If they have lied to you, are you supposed to trust them again? If they have hurt or betrayed you, do you let them into a position where they can do it again?  I wonder about this, because I wonder if when I don't, does it meant that I have not truly forgiven that person? Or does God understand the way I am feeling, and does He allow me to forgive, but not set myself up for a beating again?  The reason that I wonder about this issue, is that when my marriage broke up, I was obviously feeling very hurt. It took me a wee while, but I was able to forgive my wife for some of the things that happened. Now though, she says that she wants us to be friends. My feeling towards this is that I can't be friends with someone I can no longer respect, or trust, and that because of that I don't want to have anything to do with her. Does that meant that I haven't forgiven her, or do I have the right to try to protect myself from future hurt?  Love to know what you guys think on that one.

       Awesome God time   Got back from an awesome Easter Camp yesterday. 2300 kids all worshipping together is a great sight. On Saturday night alone there were over 100 first time commitments, and that was just a sample of God's work over the weekend. I found myself really challenged, encouraged, and touched by the Holy Spirit, more about that later. In short though, my commitment to the young people of my church has just sky-rocketed!! Praise God

       Honourable Combat   The waiting is finally over. After months of excuses, cancellations, taunts, counter-taunts, grandiose claims and belittling of opponents, the great pool championship challenge was fought.  A best of three series.  The first game, hard fought, some spectacular shots, along with some fairly ordinary play. As the boys sensed victory within their grasp, disaster struck!   For the girls that is....  Judy sunk the black, and the boys had the first round.  The second game was closer. Rory (again) sunk a freebie for the girls, and on his next turn Andy did the same. The girls played valiantly, calling on all their considerable skill, but it was not to be.   Finishing the game, and the series, with a shot even he could not miss, Rory sunk the black, to proclaim the superiority of the Andy/Rory dynamite combination.  So, I say to those who doubted, those who scoffed, those who thought the chances of Andy and I winning to be out of the realms of possibility, I say to you one and all....  Nyah Nyah Nyah Nyah!  Judy has however issued a re-challenge, stand by for a further drubbing.

        A Big Pile of Dirt   As promised last week, here follows the story of a large pile of dirt which ended up blocking my driveway.  The story begins on a Tuesday. I arrived home from work at 9:30, and found I could only just squeeze my car into the driveway, as a large pile of dirt was covering half of it. Once I got out of my car, I spoke to a worker who was just leaving. I enquired as to whether the dirt would be removed, and when. He assured me that it would be removed 'first thing in the morning'. Satisfied with that, I went to bed.  Wednesday. I look out the window at 11am, to note that the dirt is still in place. A truck sits beside the curb, but of industrious people removing the dirt, there is no sign. Clearly my view of 'first thing in the morning' is not the same as others. I note the name on the truck, and ring the company to enquire as to what is happening. The 'customer care representative' on the other end tells me I need to ring my electricity retailer, and get them to put a complaint through to the line company, who will put it right. I ask why the people who are there  right now  can't fix the problem, but to this she has no answer.  So, I ring my electricity retailer. Apparently New Zealanders are the most likely in the world to switch electricity suppliers, often at the drop of a hat. It seems the person I speak to is well aware of this fact, as her service could not be faulted. I give the details of the problem, and she promises to forward the complaint. Progress, and after only two phone calls. Too good to be true.   Yup, sure is   Twenty minutes later I receive a call from the line company. What work was being carried out? I inform the operator that I have no idea. My concern, I remind her, is that I cannot get out of my driveway without resorting to rally driving. It is their job to know what the work was, not mine. After promising to get back to me shortly, she ends the call.   Three hours later, and she has not called back, and the dirt is still there. 'Shortly' and 'first thing in the morning' are clearly relative concepts.  I take matters into my own hands, and phone the line company myself. The helpful soul I speak to this time has never heard of my complaint, and doesn't want to know. His advice? I need to ring the contractor myself, and get them to fix it. I ask why I was told to go through my retailer. His reply? "I don't have all the answers" Stifling my urge to tell him that he in fact has not provided any answers, I ask again what happened to the complaint forwarded by my retailer. He advises me that I need to speak to the contractor direct. When I mention that perhaps I need to speak to his supervisor, he suddenly is able to locate the complaint in the system. Funny that. He is still adamant that I must ring the contractor.   So, getting really sick and tired of the run around now, I make the call to the contractor. And I am pleasantly surprised to find a sympathetic person, who genuinely wants to help. She says she will make enquiries, and promises to ring back. Haven't we heard that one before though? But, to my amazement, ten minutes later, she does indeed call back. Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done until the next morning, as it is by now quite late in the day. I am assured (again) that it will be dealt with first thing in the morning.  And indeed it is. Finally, my driveway is accessible again.  What did I learn from this experience? That the person who had nothing to lose, ie the line company who has the contract for services whatever happens, could not have cared less. Where I was dealing with companies who I could choose not to use again, they were friendly, helpful, and kept their promises.

      Today New Zealand celebrated 150 years of our own Parliament. With all the things going on in our political system at the moment, the celebration sort of slipped under most people's radar, but I did catch the last few speeches of a special debate when I got home from classes. One of the things I was reminded of was the fact that New Zealand was the first country in the world to give the vote to women, all the way back in 1893. We may have just a small country, but sometimes we are able to show the rest of the world how to do things.  Having said that, I am extremely glad that our politicians have reversed their attempt to make consensual sex legal for children as young as 12 years old. While I could see the reasoning behind the proposed change, I certainly could not agree with it. The argument that changing the law is not condoning it is farcical. The very act of changing the law condones it.  Our esteemed Prime Minister, in her usual way, is saying that it was never really an option, at least not in the way it was reported. Or is it possibly a back down (again) by a government still lagging behind the opposition in opinion polls? A cynical attitude perhaps, but on past experience... Whatever the reasoning behind the change, I am glad that it has turned out this way. If sex between children that young is happening, then education about the risks involved needs to be the priority, not simply letting it happen.  College is keeping me extremely busy, and is the reason why posts are few and far between at the moment. My somewhat scattered attention span at the moment is having trouble keeping me focused on what is important.

       Emotional Farewell   Yesterday we farewelled Youth Pastor Dave, his wife Helen, and their daughter Hannah. The whole day was a farewell, with the official church farewell at the morning service, followed by a shared lunch. The evening service was a chance for the youth of the church to say goodbye to Dave. It was an emotional time, as people shared their thought, feelings and memories of the four years Dave has been our Youth Pastor.  Personally, I'm really sad to see Dave go. More than just a pastor, Dave is my friend, and has always been there for me. Even though I know that this is a great move for him, part of me just wants everything to stay the same as they have been. I know that can't happen, but with all the changes recently, I sort of took for granted that Dave would be around forever.  I also spent a great afternoon with friends at Western Springs, a big park here in Auckland. It was nice to spend the time there, even though that park is one of the places that has memories for me, as my wife and I would go there a lot. In some ways it was weird going back there, the first time I have since we separated. Because of that, it was good to have friends with me, especially some I haven't caught up with properly for a while. Because she just can't help herself,  urlLink Rach  has taken photos, so pop over to her  urlLink photo blog  to check them out.

        A Nice Farewell   Tonight I had a farewell dinner for my Youth Pastor and his wife.  urlLink Rach  and I organized a surprise dinner for them. Getting 12 people, plus the two guests of honour, to the restaurant at the right time is no mean feat, especially considering the state of Auckland traffic at that time of the evening! Also fooling Dave and Helen into thinking they were just having dinner with  urlLink Rach  was tricky, but we pulled it off, and they had no idea. That was very satisfying, as Dave is not an easy person to fool.  Overall we had a good night, as it was a group of people at pretty much the same age and stage in life, good friends, and sharing a meal with friends about to move away. I'm really glad to have done it, but I won't be organizing any more surprise events for a while, as the stress I can do without!   urlLink Rach  will have some photos of the night  urlLink here

        Big Thank You   To  urlLink Rach  for coming to my rescue after I 'broke' my blog while trying to change the template. Although usually I am pretty technologically literate, when it comes to web stuff I am useless.  Working hard on assignments the last couple of weeks has left me little time to blog, but has given me plenty of things to think about, so look out for more ramblings to come. The tale of a driveway, a large pile of dirt, and several 'customer care representatives' who didn't, is probably the next story to appear.  Watch this space   But not for too long, cause its just a space, and probably won't do anything exciting, even if you are watching  Probably  because  you're watching

       Movies, Clothes, Cars and Newspapers   Went to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban today with a group from college. We all really enjoyed it, although we felt that one of the actors was not right for the part he was in. Of course, we couldn't actually think of anyone better, but we just had that feeling he wasn't right. Everyone's a critic I guess! Other than that we really enjoyed it, and had a good time.  After the movie a few of us wandered around the mall, and I actually did some clothes shopping. Now, normally I hate clothes shopping, and in fact any shopping in general. On the rare occasions I do shop for clothes myself, I work out what I want, where to get it, and I go in fast and get out. But one of my friends needed to get a jersey, and the girls decided to give him some advice. Even though I hadn't been intending to buy anything, I ended up taking the opportunity for some advice. So, I ended up outfitting myself again, and hopefully this will hold me for a while.   urlLink Rach  has asked me to go with her tomorrow to look at a car she is considering buying. Naturally I am relieved that she has finally recognized my vast knowledge of motor vehicle related matters, and is wisely seeking my counsel. Actually though, I know very little about cars, but it is still nice to be asked to give an opinion.  And again, no Tuesday newspaper. Ah well, what can you do?

       Weekend   A quiet weekend. The weather was miserable, so I pretty much spent all my time at home. Had a group of friends over after church on Sunday to watch a movie. The chosen DVD was "Love, Actually", a romantic comedy. Now, anyone who knows me would say that I hate romantic comedies. I've never been overly interested in watching them, and will go out of my way to avoid them. But, suprisingly, I actually enjoyed this one. It was interesting as we watched, seeing how the stories developed, and how the characters were feeling in their various situations. Funnily enough, most of us could relate to the way they were feeling at some time or another. Interestingly I see that  urlLink Rach  also watched the same movie on Sunday night, and had a different opinion altogether.

       Um, What are you actually there for?   In the news at the moment is one of our Members of Parliament who has abstained or not voted on two quite crucial votes recently. The first one resulted in the bill being passed by only one vote. The second occasion the one vote would not have made a difference, but still the MP is being criticized by many people for not voting.  My view is that we don't pay an MP a huge salary for them not to have an opinion. If there is a vote being taken, it is their job to vote on it. The trouble in this particular case is that the person in question is a list MP, meaning people have not voted for him personally, but for the party he belongs to. He was put on his parties list to represent his particular ethnic group, and they, and others, are now saying that he is not representing them as he should. It is being suggested that he should either resign now, or remove himself from the party list at the next election. The issues currently being debated in our parliament are too important to have people sitting on the fence.

       What are you, 12?   I feel it is my duty to mock  urlLink Rach  for her purchase of a pair of roller shoes. The concept of this item is ridiculous. Shoes are shoes, and skates are skates, and this is the way it should remain. This genetic modification of footwear sets a dangerous precedent. Where will it all end? That is my question, where  will  it all end? But seriously, I look forward to watching  urlLink Rach's  adventures on these shoes, and since I almost broke my foot while on a pogo stick at Christmas, perhaps I should temper my mocking.  In other matters, I feel that the youth who delivers my newspaper and I will shortly come to blows. The consistency and accuracy of the deliveries is sketchy at best. Whole weeks will go by without a single paper being delivered. This week is a case in point. I should receive a newspaper on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. On Tuesday, I felt as Old Mother Hubbard must have on reaching that celebrated cupboard, as when I got there, the paper was where? Not to be found at all. On Thursday, yes, I did receive a paper, and then tonight, he or she outdid him/herself. Not one, but two copies of the Friday edition. Perhaps on the assumption that I should get three papers a week, and I  did  get three papers, so we must be all square. Since it is a free newspaper, I suppose I shouldn't really complain, but still, it is the principle of the thing. I also suspect that this same youth is delivering my Wednesday free newspaper, as this only arrived yesterday evening, and in other weeks has been conspicuous by its absence.   Here endeth the ranting

       Last Day   Tomorrow will be the last day of the first semester! Hooray! I have made it through the first half of the year. Now, a well deserved 4 weeks off, before it all begins again!  Over the break I will be seeing the new Harry Potter movie with a group of classmates (yay! Looking forward to this hugely!), and a karaoke night has been planned. Not sure about that one, some say my singing is best kept for the shower (philistines, what would they know? Untalented hacks, etc, etc, etc)  Other than work, and those couple of social events, I have four weeks all to myself! Oh, the bliss!

       Ch-ch-ch-changes   Since I've drastically altered my appearance, I thought that I should also change the cartoon of me in my profile. I added a guitar, since my latest project is teaching myself to play. I started to learn at College, but I was finding this hard, given that it was a group learning situation. So, I have bought a teach yourself to play book, and I am working through it, with some success.  Another visit to the old home town over the weekend. A very enjoyable time, catching up with friends, plus a visit to my parents, who again had a list of questions about their computer for me to answer.  I'm almost at the end of the semester, and I'm really looking forward to the holiday, and the lighter timetable that I will have next semester.

       And the results are in...   Yes, your votes have been counted, considered, much thought has been given, and this morning, after final consideration, the beard, and the mustache, were removed.  This has been a startling day for me. Every time I catch sight of myself in a mirror I get a shock! And when I rub where the beard was, as I often do when thinking, I suddenly remember.  It was interesting to note the reactions of people at work, and at college. A lot of people didn't actually notice until they looked twice. Once they had noticed though, everyone seemed to approve. I think that I'm the one finding it most difficult to cope with the change, as I had the beard for 6 years, and the mustache for 8.   In all, I'm feeling pretty good about the change.

       As we age, we grow up   Well, duh, I guess that is an obvious statement to make. What I mean is that we change the way we think, the way we behave. Today I had an online conversation with an ex-girlfriend, who I haven't spoken to in several years. I made contact by email a few months ago, using a reunion website. It wasn't till today though that we had any real contact, other then forwarding each other joke emails as one more name in a distribution list. Today she was online, and we chatted for a while, and made a tentative arrangement to catch up next time I pass through where she lives.  Because of the way we split up, the way things turned out, I never really thought we would have contact again, it seemed as though she would never want to speak to me again. But it was all a long time ago, and I guess that it is true that over time things change. I'm glad that we're in contact again, as I've often wondered what happened to her, how she was doing. And I still have some apologizing to do, for my behaviour when we broke up.   I guess as I get a bit older, and dare I say, a bit wiser, I realise that the way I behaved in some situations was not the best. In a lot of cases I guess I will never get the chance to put things right, but where I can, I feel like I should.

       Just another day   Sometimes there are days when not much happens. Today is one of those. I went to college to work on an assignment with some people in my class, and went to work. Work was extremely slow and boring, although with an absence of stupid customers/questions. On that note, I have a new champion in the "What is the most ridiculous Lotto related question someone can ask me" competition. This question I thought was particularly good - "Did the guaranteed millionaire go last week?" What does one do in this situation? Do I explain the definition of 'guaranteed', or do I just say 'yes it did' and leave it at that. Much as I would have enjoyed the sarcastic option, I went with the nice one.  In other news, I found out today I will be going to Wellington for a week in September as a student representative to the Teacher's Union National Conference. This should be quite interesting.  Finally, the facial hair poll continues.  urlLink Rach  has provided pictures of the possible before and after, so head over  urlLink there  and check it out, then come back and vote.

       The Green, Green Grass of Home   I visited my parents yesterday, as I needed to interview my mother for a college assignment.  It's always interesting when I go down there now. There aren't many of my friends from school left there. Its not a town that tends to retain people once they leave school. The majority seem to go off to university, and never return. My best friend Nick is still there though, even though he has left a couple of times, he comes back.  It was nice to see my parents, I don't spend nearly as much time visiting them as I should. It was also good to catch up with Nick.  At the moment I'm thinking about what I will do when I finish Teacher's College. I've been thinking recently that I will probably move out of Auckland. I've been here for almost ten years, and thought it was only going to be temporary. I first came here when I joined the RNZAF, and then after I left there I just stayed, got married, and just never left. Now I'm thinking that perhaps its time for a new start, a new location. I'm not sure where I would want to go, but the Waikato is definitely an option. But would I ever go back to my hometown? I don't think so. To me it would feel like a step backwards, like admitting I couldn't make it outside, and I was retreating. Anyway, I have a couple of years to think about it.

       Hair today.... Tomorrow? Who knows?   Today I had a haircut. Well, more than one, because it isn't economically sound to just get them cut one at a time. Best to do them all at once, and save time as well. But I'm digressing.  Today I went to have my hair cut. For me this is a big occasion, because since my hairline went into its major retreat mode, I have tended to avoid doing anything that might hasten the disappearance. But my hair was getting undeniably shaggy at the back, and so I decided I should have something done about it. I went to a place in the local mall, where you pay eight dollars for a cut, so I wasn't expecting miracles. When I entered the barber was being berated by an irate customer for the job he had done on her son's hair. This did not fill me with confidence, but then I thought, hey, what are you expecting for eight bucks? Joh Bailey?  So, with some trepidation, I sat in the chair. Now, my original intention was just to get it tidied up at the back, and not to touch what little remained at the front. But, sitting there, I was struck by a brilliant idea. If I got him to make it  all  short, the receding hairline won't look so bad. Okay, so I know nothing about how hair styles work. If I did, I'd be a hairdresser, not a student teacher!  When I saw the result, I was a little shocked, and a little dismayed. I was reminded again how big and shiny my forehead is. But, you can't stick the hair back, so off I trotted to class, to see what reaction I would get.  Suprisingly good. I had nothing but favourable comments, and some people who couldn't believe how short it was felt the need to rub my head, which was a little weird. But even some girls in the class who hardly ever speak to me commented on it favourably. In fact, they are now talking about my next style change, which they think should be the removal of my goatee. Its something I've thought about before, as most of the people I hang out with now have never seen me without it, but it is a big step.  Maybe the change in hair style, and the possible change in facial hair is about my change in image. I have made some significant lifestyle changes recently, some forced on me by circumstances, and others by choice. I guess that changing my appearance is part of that, part of moving on to a new stage in my life.

       The Boys Are Back In Town   Well, back at the college anyway! Oh, and the girls are back too, just to be inclusive and caring.  Yes, this week saw the start of the second semester, and my few weeks of leisure have come to  an end. When my alarm clock went off on Monday morning, I  wondered who had snuck into my room and changed the setting! Talk about shocks to the system. What with early rising, confronting the traffic, and finding a parking space, all before I even step into a classroom! But it is good to be back, catching up with friends again, and diving head-first into a whole new batch of subjects. Also I will be out in a classroom for four weeks later in the semester, and I'm really looking forward to that.   If I Could Turn Back Time   Sometimes I think we all do things we later wish we hadn't. Situations we could have handled better, things we should, or shouldn't have said. I once read a column by someone, who wondered what life would be like if Windows shortcut keys worked in real life, if we could 'CTRL Z' whenever we stuffed up. Sometimes I would love to be able to do that, just take back mistakes and try again. At other times I realize that mistakes are part of life, that sometimes we are going to make choices and take actions that are not the smartest. The only sure way to avoid making mistakes, to avoid doing something stupid, to avoid getting hurt, is to do nothing. If we shut ourselves up in a little box, where no one can see us, and we can see no one, then we can keep ourselves safe from hurt, and prevent ourselves from hurting others. But that isn't how life is meant to be lived. Life isn't about hiding, it isn't about always playing it safe. Sometimes you have to take that chance, try for that goal. Once I said about myself that 'there was a time I would go out on a limb, just to see how far I could go before it broke'. That person, the one who took chances, and got hurt a lot, seems very far away now, but sometimes I still catch a glimpse of him, and he encourages me to take the chance.  What is behind the above musing? As always, with me, there is something that prompts what I write. This time it is a situation I have created, by saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. It has led to a tense situation, and I'm now trying to work through it, hoping that time, and my leaving things alone, will fix the mess I created, when I took a chance.

       Technology  Computers are wonderful things. You can spend hours saving time with them. One of my favourite quotes, and never more true than tonight! I had my post for the evening all typed up, just needed to publish it, and one of those wonderful internet errors occurs, and I lose it all! Oh well, I probably need the typing practice anyway.   In other technological issues today, I was going to take my portable CD player to be repaired, as it stopped working a while ago. I decided to give it one more try before taking it in, and lo and behold, it was working fine. I cancelled my trip to the shop, and later the same afternoon, it stopped working again. So, tomorrow, back I go to the mall, to do the job I should have done already today.     Back to the grind  Next week is back to college. This is good, because it means I get to see my classmates again, and exercise my brain again. This is also bad, as it means that I have to go back to getting up early, and means I will have to go to bed earlier than I have been over the past couple of weeks. I'm not a morning person, and never have been. I far prefer to be up late into the night and sleep late, than be up at o-dark-hundred. But, as teaching is a profession that will require me to be awake in the morning, I guess I will have to get used to it.  I often joke that I am on autopilot until about 10am. Getting up, breakfast, getting to class, all this seems to happen without conscious thought, and then around 10am I wake up. Previous coworkers, and current classmates, have commented on this phenomenon. They say I sit quite quietly in the room for the first part of the morning, and then at about 10 look around suddenly, with a wild and startled expression, and take notice of what is going on around me. For this reason I try where possible not to schedule any important meetings or decisions before "wake up time", because I will invariably make the wrong decision.

       Its Just A Glass, Actually  &nbsp;  I took a test to see how optimistic I am:   Results of "The Test"&nbsp;   When it comes to the classic glass half empty or half full question, you seem to be balancing precariously on the fence. Essentially, you're a realist who sees the world in various shades of gray rather than black and white. While you know things don't always work out the way we anticipate, you also recognize - and use to your advantage -the power of positive thinking. You want to hope for the best, and try to keep those rose-colored glasses on as often as possible. This approach to life, should you develop it more fully, will surely give you an edge over all the negative Neds and Nancys out there; research has proven that expecting the best creates a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. You believe, for example, that the attractive stranger at a party really will call and in turn you come across as confident and approachable. You know the deal - when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Put in a little more effort to look on the bright side and you'll be heading down the right path.   Interesting. But pretty accurate I have to say.  &nbsp;  Went to see "King Arthur" tonight. I quite enjoyed it, even though it was very different from the traditional Arthurian legends I remember reading. A good night out, in good company, especially as one of my closest friends has just returned from South Africa.  &nbsp;  Tomorrow (well, more like today, now)&nbsp;is  urlLink Rach's  induction, so I will be heading up for that, and to be humiliated in a round of mini golf. The things I do for my friends!

       The Week That Was   I've been enjoying the first week of my holiday, and haven't done all that much with my time. Today was lunch with  urlLink Rach  and watching a DVD (Paycheck). Tomorrow, another movie. Ah, what a stressful life I am leading.   On Saturday I will be exercising my vocal talents with Karaoke at a friend's place. Fortunately the only audience will be people who have already seen me make a fool of myself!  Tomorrow is an interesting day for me. It is several different occasions, all in one day. In no particular order, it is: my brother's birthday, the third anniversary of my baptism at HBC, and would be my fourth wedding anniversary. So, with all those things on that one day, I guess I'll be on a bit of an emotional roller coaster tomorrow. Already this evening I'm starting to feel it, and intend to keep myself busy tomorrow.

       The New Look Revealed   Here we go, for those who wanted to see the new me:     So, there I am in all my clean shaven glory. Looking very handsome and trim, 27, house-trained, single, can cook. Free to a good home!    Rachel's New Car  I went with Rach today to help her look for a new car. She was after a Celica, since it didn't look like she was going to get the skyline. We didn't find the Celica, but after some searching, she found and fell in love with an outstanding Mitsubishi FTO. Its a great car, and I'm insanely jealous! (But she says I can drive it sometimes!)

       Vincent   Starry starry night, paint your palette blue and grey Look out on a summer's day with eyes that know the darkness in my soul Shadows on the hills, sketch the trees and the daffodils Catch the breeze and the winter chills, in colors on the snowy linen land  Now I understand what you tried to say to me How you suffered for you sanity How you tried to set them free They would not listen they did not know how, perhaps they'll listen now  Starry starry night, flaming flowers that brightly blaze Swirling clouds in violet haze reflect in Vincent's eyes of chine blue Colors changing hue, morning fields of amber grain Weathered faces lined in pain are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand  For they could not love you, but still your love was true And when no hope was left in sight, on that starry starry night You took your life as lovers often do, But I could have told you, Vincent, This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you  Starry, starry night, portraits hung in empty halls Frameless heads on nameless walls with eyes that watch the world and can't forget. Like the stranger that you've met, the ragged man in ragged clothes The silver thorn of bloody rose, lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow  Now I think I know what you tried to say to me How you suffered for your sanity How you tried to set them free They would not listen they're not listening still    Perhaps they never will.

       Those Were The Days   I haven't been posting much recently, as my free time gradually fills up again after the holidays. I prefer to be busy, than to have nothing to do, but sometimes I find that the days get just a little bit  too  busy!   urlLink Rachel's  post the other day regarding memories got me thinking a bit. I started to think about the person I was when I was younger, the personality I had, and what was important to me then. I found that I was a very different person then than I am now. I guess that is to be expected, that I would change as I grew older.  While I was doing this thinking, and realizing how I had changed, I started to think about what were the things that had caused me to change. At college at the moment I am studying development, how we learn, and what makes us who we are, and I guess a natural extension of this is that I would start to think about what has made me me.  One of the things I have found as I have examined myself is that I always try to see the good in others. I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt, and maybe trust people a bit more easily than I should. When you are young I think it is easier to do that, because you don't have the experience of trust being broken. As I got older, I found that sometimes people you trust can hurt you, not always intentionally, but hurt you just the same.  Eventually I came to the conclusion that the only people who can betray your trust, are the people you trust. With that knowledge, comes a dilemma. I can not trust anyone, in order to protect my emotions, and in doing so not live life to the full, or I can continue to trust people, and, sometimes, get hurt.  While there are times when I feel as though I would like to shut myself away from the world, and keep my feelings locked up in a box where no one can get at me, I know that that is not really an option. If I am to experience all that life has to offer, then part of that deal is going to be the odd hurt. The question therefore, is how to deal with that hurt, as and when it comes along.  More musings tomorrow.....

       What A Wonderful World   I had a really good weekend. On Friday night after work I went ten pin bowling with friends, on Saturday had a few people over to watch some DVD's, and last night after church had more people over for cards. My house is becoming the venue for people to gather after the evening service. Its great to have the house full of people having fun, although it does mean a late night, and then an early start in the morning!  Last night's service was extra special as it was my friend Natalie's baptism. I have known Natalie for quite a few years, and it was so great to see her take this step in her faith walk. Natalie is an amazing person, she is blessed with so many talents, and an amazing faith. She's one of my favourite people in all the world, and it was so good to be able to share this special time with her.   Raindrops Keep Fallin On My Head   The situation which I described last week is not improving. I've been receiving different advice from different friends on how I should handle things. Some say I should talk to the person involved, and try to sort it out that way, others are saying I should leave them to come around in their own time. What makes it hard is that this is someone I have strong feelings towards, and the fact that things have worked out the way they have hurts. But life must go on, and I can only hope that in time she comes round, and things go back to where they were.
