      YOU RAISE ME UP  Lyrics by Brendan Graham Music by Rolf Lovland  When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary When troubles come and my heart burdened be Then, I am still and wait here in the silence, Until you come and sit awhile with me.  You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas I am strong, when I am on your shoulders You raise me up... to more than I can be.  You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas I am strong, when I am on your shoulders You raise me up... to more than I can be.  There is no life - no life without its hunger Each restless heart beats so imperfectly But when you come and I am filled with wonder Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity.  You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas And I am strong, when I am on your shoulders You raise me up... to more than I can be. You raise me up... to more than I can be.

      When You Say You Love Me Lyrics  Like the sound of silence calling, I hear your voice and suddenly I'm falling, lost in a dream. Like the echoes of our souls are meeting, You say those words and my heart stops beating. I wonder what it means. What could it be that comes over me? At times I can't move. At times I can hardly breath.  When you say you love me, The world goes still, so still and silent. When you say you love me, For a moment, there's no one else alive.  You're the one I've always thought of. I don't know how, but I feel sheltered in your love. You're where I belong. And when you're with me if I close my eyes, There are times I swear I feel like I can fly For a moment in time. Somewhere between the Heavens and Earth , And frozen in time, Oh when you say those words.  When you say you love me The world goes still, so still and silent. When you say you love me For a moment there's no one else alive.  [bridge:] And this journey that we're on. How far we've come and I celebrate every moment. And when you say you love me, That's all you have to say. I'll always feel this way.  When you say you love me The world goes still, so still and silent. When you say you love me In that moment I know why I'm alive.  When you say you love me. When you say you love me. Do you know how I love you?

      i think life is kinda of bland for me. what are friends there are happy moments but there are also depressing ones. peopl do not realise whatb they are doing. there small things could haf just upsetted their friend. i confess that i haf been trying real hard to maintain my status , pathetic. but i got full mark for my test and i kind of expected it. i hope i can get high marks for physics. fingers crossed. i got 77 for chinese test. i hate things the way they are. i wish that i can change sumthing but i can't . being practical i know that sumthings are just out of my reach. i haf this urge, this desire, this wish, this yearn, this hope, this resolution to get good grades and i mean really good ones. when i think of it i will study harder.  just like what the prince of egypt says. how can you measure the value of life thru your naked eyes? you can only see the value through the god's eyes the heaven's eyes. you might be a strand of thread but with the other strand syou will make a beautiful carpet.

      erm... i am really happy today. no becos some one had finally seen her true clours but my frined had seen a baddie's true colours and not fall for her trap anymore. i think she should really think and ponder about her " mei you ren yuan" prob and not blame it on others. she is far too mean to others. having said that she is a dog of emily and emily is her god. too mean.:p GOOD DAY  i think she is taking too much credit and she doesn't haf to sit there cos she never teach you know......is choo qi that is teaching not her. hse should let jiamin to do it but having said that i dun like jiamin so i also dun like her to do the shouting... funny hor me. LET ME DO IT!!!!!! hhaha.....

      it had been a long time since i last wrote, there was so much feelings and thots inside me that i can barely write them up. juz imagine every morning being called by my mum, i would struggle to keep my eyes open and it's really a tough job. but meanwhile i will comb my hair- yes sub-conciously. that's how vain i am. then i will try to pull my eyelids open. then when i will sit on the bed and try to catch a nether really short nap that would last for juz a couple of seconds till my mum calls for me Again.then i will stand up and put down my cosy and warmed pillow. it was warmed by my own cheeks arh.....its juz so comfortable. then i will reach for my blanklet and fold them. then i will walk across the room to get my towel then again across the room again to get my undies and then again across to get my uniform. you would think that my room sounds big but its juz me being dumb and making so many trips across the room. then i will walked into the bathroom and straight away, i would put my clothes aside and reach for the toilet bowl. then i will brush my teeth and wash my face then i will wash my undies and start bathing. then i will wet my hair and then get out. then i will spent couple of minutes in front of the mirror. then i will get into the kitchen to pop several supplement pills and then i would wear my socks. and if time allows again, i would lie on the sofa to close my eyes for several minutes. then i will get out of the house and head for the busstop where i juz wait for a couple of minutes for 30. i would always pray that there are seats in the bus so that i can sit down. sumtimes i meet some of my friends and tok to them. school next  thats' my life. but i kind of like it i hate complex things. i like simple and sweet things so i dun understand why people make them complex. i dun want to be outstanding but i want some SOME attention.  i am proud proud of things i am good at. i hate it when i can't get things done. and when i get them done, like a little kid, i will feel a sense of achievement. i am also too observant and too in depth. i sound like i am contradiicting myself. but i really tend to see things in a complex way. thats  bad. it makes me frustrated and depressed. i like to be like they are originally. i like good things i hate bad things i want good grades i hate bad people. i am nerdy i haf to. i avoid being crazy though it isn't really me when people tries to compete with me. i will compete with them. if people wants to fight with me, i will fight with them. dun anger me, you shall die even if you surrender, i will continue. i hate people to try to make things difficult for me and pick on me. i hate poeple who tries to break the friand ship i haf with others. i hate imperfect things. i am a perfectionist but i can be messy at times. i can stand my messiness but i can't stand others. i try to be good to everyone and i dun understand how can some people be so mean to others. thats' me. the real me.  i want to be the best and i love competition. cos i will be able to win. i love to win. and i hate to lose especially to those people who i think is worse than me. i like to lose to people who is better than me  so that i can learn more things. i hate my childhood. cos i lost many opportunities to be a better me. i want to haf talents. i want to learn exactly how to play a piano, how to dance ballet, how to sing, how to swim. how to how to how to, a million how to and i would juz want to learnt. i like rigid things and love to teach people. i juz teach i like to explain things clearly to others. i love it. i loke the feeling when i completely clear their doubts.  i can be a hypocrite. but its only to people i dislike. i dislike them. dislike the way they does things and treat people. they are bad people. at least to me. i assume that i haf seen their true colours and like everyone to see too so that they will not fall into the baddies' trip.   i am a worrier; a born worrier; just like my mum. i worry at the slightest things- like when i did not poo for Couple of days.  i am afraid of my health. i dun wan to fall sick. i want to be normally and find some one i love and get married . he can undeerstand me and do things juz rite. knows i want and keep his affection to me forever- even when he grows 80. i would love him.  i am a mundane person. i drink the same drink everyday- peach red tea and eat the same snack- chicken cubes. i do things like a routine though there are always times where i will go out of track. but i hate go out of track. i would like people to like me and be their best friends. i like them to confide to me and be cosy with me.

      another song that reflectly my feels just nice......  once again by josh groban   Remember When It Rained  Wash away the thoughts inside That keep my mind away from you. No more love and no more pride And thoughts are all I have to do.    Ohhhhhh Remember when it rained. Felt the ground and looked up high And called your name. Ohhhhhh Remember when it rained. In the darkness I remain.    Tears of hope run down my skin. Tears for you that will not dry. They magnify the one within And let the outside slowly die.  Ohhhhhh Remember when it rained. I felt the ground and looked up high And called your name. Ohhhhhh Remember when it rained. In the water I remain Running down Running down Running down Running down Running down Running down Running down

      this is another song which i adore       by josh groban my fav singer  My Confession Lyrics  I have been blind, unwilling to see The true love you're giving. I have ignored every blessing. I'm on my knees confessing  That I feel myself surrender Each time I see your face. I am staggered by your beauty, Your unassuming grace. And I feel my heart is turning, Falling into place. I can't hide Now hear my confession.  I have been wrong about you. Thought I was strong without you. For so long nothing could move me. For so long nothing could change me. Now I feel myself surrender Each time I see your face. I am captured by your beauty, Your unassuming grace. And I feel my heart is turning, Falling into place. I can't hide Now hear my confession.  [bridge:] You are the air that I breath. You're the ground beneath my feet. When did I stop believing?  Cause I feel myself surrender  Each time I see your face. I am staggered by your beauty, Your unassuming grace. And I feel my heart  Falling into place. I can't hide Now hear my confession. I can't hide Now hear my confession. Hear my confession    it kind says my feeling...... i mean all the song i chose i either like the meloddy or the lyrices or both...mostly both....plus plus the singing's wonderful melodious voice...of course!!!!

      i love this song  there you'll be faith hill  When I think back on these times  And the dreams we left behind  I'll be glad 'cause I was blessed  To get to have you in my life When I look back on these days  I'll look and see your face You were right there for me  In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky In my heart there will always be a place for you For all my life I'll keep a part of you with me And everywhere I am, there you'll be  Well you showed me how to feel Feel the sky was in my reach And I always will remember all the strength you gave to me  Your love made me make it through Oh, I owe so much to you You were right there for me  In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky In my heart there will always be a place for you For all my life I'll keep a part of you with me And everywhere I am, there youll be  'Cause I always saw in you my light, my strength And I want to thank you now  For all the ways you were right there for me You were right there for me For always     i had quite a hard time finding it...cos i kept forgettiiing its lyrics

      this is another time i am down. i mean why does she leave me out all the time ...maybe deep down her heart she does not want me to go but...i really feel "not a friend"...... i doubt the words she say to be i doubt that she cares for me the most. i really doubt it..... it seems very fake..... i want to go to choir but i dun want to go back alone.....i want her to ask me.....i want to catch up with things.....and she never ask what thing or what .....that's what friends are for...i reallly like treat her as my reallly best friend and this is what i get.... i always put in so much effort in a friendship but i dun get back what i gif .....my so-called frens are not there when i need them......even if they are......they dun put in effort to help me when i alone can't get over things.... i am quite independent but there are always times when i need sumone to tide over some stuff. i want to be with the rest but she is like stopping me......she just forgets that i do want to go back...i dun miss. but i want to go back.....

      when i heard from slyvia about her. the memories we had flooded back into my mind. i miss her. she is funny.sweet.thoughtful.blur.and i love her. she became slimmer when i saw her walking towards the busstop a few months ago. i am really delighted and rejoiced to see her still asking slyvia about me. she hasn't forgot about me. yah. so cos i am too shy to meet her or what. i think there is this fear inside me. but i dunno how to describe it. i was thinking of writing her her letter. i guess she wil be shocked. utterly shocked. i got lots to tell. i am tell her not to go on diet...blah blah.....she is pretty enough. her features are so defined and beutiful. anyway i think i will write the letter.and then it would be up to fate to see if she will receive it .i hope she hasn't moved.

           “SAP schools are racially divisive and hence have no place in the multi-racial Singapore.” Do you agree?         Every two or three years, some member of the Parliament will request for the closure of Special Assistance Plan schools, commonly known as SAP schools. SAP schools, which were established in 1979 to preserve the unique culture and traditional values in the Chinese schools, are thought by some to produce racists who discriminated against the other races- the Malays and Indians.  While seemingly true, this is not the case. SAP schools are not racially divisive in which this case means to have an effect of separating people into different distinctive groups. Instead, SAP schools have been coming up with comprehensive programmes to inculcate racial harmony in their students. SAP schools still have a role to play in Singapore. Furthermore, students have many opportunities to mix with other races outside school, not merely just in schools. Thus, they do have a place in the multi-racial Singapore.  Firstly, SAP schools are putting lots of efforts in coming up with comprehensive programmes to inculcate racial harmony and not produce racists. Besides staple events which every student takes part in, for example the celebration of Racial Harmony Day and Heritage tours, every SAP schools also organise and adopt its own programmes. Several schools have come up with unique programmes which includes the organisation of home visits, multi-racial team games and home stays in which student obtain the chance to live with each other’s families. As SAP schools are aware that they have a largely Chinese population of students, they work a lot harder about this issue than most schools. Some SAP schools have taken the lead in reaching out to the neighbourhood schools- coaching, mentoring and involving them in ethnic festivals, thus ensuring that their students get a chance to interact with the other races.  In fact, the only difference is that SAP schools consist of a largely Chinese population while other schools have a god racial mix in their student population. SAP schools are of no difference from any typical schools. What is taught during the curriculum time is similar to that of other schools. SAP schools do what other schools do. The races of population of a school do not affect the students’ mentality towards other races. Just by putting two students of different race together do not ensure racial harmony. It is the students’ attitude towards the other races count. For example, a student who is Malay may come from a typical secondary school but is bias against the Chinese. Hence, the race of the population does not affect greatly the students’ attitude towards the other races.  Secondly, SAP schools still have a role to play in the education system of Singapore. SAP schools, through the teaching of English and Chinese both at first-language level, aim to raise Mandarin to first language level alongside English, preserve the Chinese cultural heritage and preserve the valuable environment of the Chinese school system. This allows the younger generation to acquire a deep knowledge of Chinese culture and traditions and ensures that the Chinese traditional values like filial piety, diligence and modesty are being passed on to the next generation.  Furthermore, one of the other objectives of SAP schools is to nurture sufficient Chinese elites to engage with China economically and politically. These Chinese elites also serve as “bridges” to connect the Western countries, like the United State of America and the European countries, and other countries like India, which uses English as the main language, with China which uses Mandarin as their main language as these Chinese elites not only have a good command in English but also a full understanding of the Chinese heritage. Thus SAP schools do have a place in the multi-racial Singapore.  Lastly, students from SAP schools do have many other opportunities to mix with the other races outside school. Racial harmony is also important outside school, not just merely in schools. Students get a chance to interact with people from other races in places like tuition centres, their workplace when they enter the society and the neighbourhood activities held by the Community Centres or Residents’ Committee. Furthermore, males are entitled to another opportunity- during their National Service. During the National Service, men of different races come together and bond together to understand one another’s culture and way of living. They live together, eat together and sleep together. National Service provides the males a shared experience, which cuts across the barrier of race. SAP schools do not eliminate a student’s chance of interacting with other races, thus letting him grow up to become a racist. There are many other opportunities for him to interact with other races out there .

         i was thinking....is what she say true....i mean i thot i told her everything. unless it's becos i really got nothing to say..          WEITING : she is this friend i know since sec2. i couldnt remember how i met her, probably through choir and chooqi. she's one real girl who shows her happiness and anger. she's damn timid too ( how come she's a leo then?) but of course she had her devil side too. well, it's her selfishness and her hot temper. i think. that's all. it's the 2 bad things i can find on her. but, she cares for her friend alot. but yet, she demands alot from her friends ( which, personaly, i hate it). yea, she herself also doesnt know that she used to make me cry ALOT. i wished that i had known her earlier, as in in primary school. because all along, i hoped that someone great would be by my side, and we would do everything together. oh well, i met her a little too late i guess. somehow, she has been apart of my life. somehow, i've tell her alot of stuff. but yet, she hides alot from me. so well. but...hmmm...i think that if she wants to say she'll tell me. so it's kinda up to her. actually, i think that if she can be a little quiet and alittle introvert, we'll be really good friends. but she's not like that. oh well, but there arent a perfect friend is there? anyway, i thanks her for letting me see some of the evil side of people. and she's been right. but yet, i am someone who doesnt change me view about a person, even someone says bad things about him or her. UNLESS, i see it for myself. and haha, for some few people, i did really see it for myself.       this is yitien.
