      Well there went the whole writing every day plan. I was just so confused with various emotions to know what to say. I still don't know what to say in the aspect that all would be confused.  Lets just say I made the right choice, the one that keeps me in a happy, lasting relationship.   I will write more later, I have to study for finals.

      I feel it coming moreso than ever before. I know he is going to want a break, but this time I will not stick around and wait. There is no sensible reason for this. We never get to see eachother, or moreso I never get to see him by his choice. It seems like he loves me when its convenient for him. I hate him so much right now.  Ugh.   -Audrey

      Last night was exactly what I needed. Ashley and me, just being us. I worked until 1:00 and went shopping ang other random stuff with my mother, which means I finally got my digital camera! Woot Woot! I am going to crem thinking about it. Then Ashley and I met up around 5:30, chilled here for a while then off to some stores.   WE still had a long as time before we went to our movie so we just cruised 'the strip.' haha yeah. Then we saw Kyle and Jordan and they were racing us and I lost, damn stick shift. Then trying to regain my car's reputation at the next stop light I attempted to kick their ass. However, when I jumped over into the next lane because the car in front of me was going very slow, I didn't see that car, then almost got me and Ashley killed. I did however keep us alive, we only drove away with being flipped off.   Then we saw Mean Girls. Good movie, a little extreme however. Then we came back to my house, goofed around with our cameras. She has me making cow and sheep noises recorded. Haha amusing times. But we were laughing so hard my cheeks almost still hurts. :)   We fell asleep around 11:30-11:45  and I woke up at 9:30. She was already awake getting ready for church. We then realized it was raining, so I crawled out of bed and drove her there so she wouldn't have to walk. What a nice friend am I hey?  I am up much earlier than I would like to be, I wish I would have slept until like noon at least. lol. Well I guess thats it for now.

      Things have been so-so lately. I am extremely tired, this is completely my fault though because I didn't have to stay at Adam's until 1:30 when I knew I had to be awake at 7:00 for work at 9:00. Ugh. I didn't go to sleep until about 2:30 and I woke up at 7:00. Lovely lack of sleep I would say.   Today I am supposed to be doing something with Ashley. I'm going to call her in a few minutes, I really wanna go to the movies, so we shall see what happens.  Ugh I am so tired, and this is all after I slept at Adam's for 3 hours. He had promised his brother he would play a game with him online before I had gotten there, so at 10:00, they finally started playing it and since I was so tired and had nothing else to do, I fell asleep. Then at about 1:30 I feel someone on top of me (gently laying, not sexual) and I wake up to see my Adam. Then I laid around with him for a while, and I could hardly keep my eyes open so I decided it was best to go home. He offered to follow me, but I said I was ok.   Damn period happening every month on our anniversary. But I don't know, he seemed very much less affectionate because of the fact that we couldn't have sex. I hope that our relationship isn't just sex to him, because that would kill me. Sex can be an important part, but not the entire thing, and definetly not the MOST important part.   I am beginning to think that all the plans for this summer, his special proposal, his already purchasing a ring and making payments on it, the whole theory of borrowing his mom's boyfriends pontoon, or renting an RV, none of it is going to happen.   I am not holding my breath. I love Adam dearly, I just think he's a lot of talk.

      Today was long and tiring. I spent the day at school feeling and looking fat. I did enjoy some classes, but sitting in french on my very last day of school with my best friend ever was a little difficult. I cried almost all the way through my next class.   Then I came home and slept for about two hours. I miss Adam so much. He has been spending a lot of time with Paul lately. I don't like the idea of that much because Paul is a major pot head now. Adam has quit all of that, I don't want him  pressured. And he obviously was on Tuesday night when he was so drunk he doesn't remember getting high.   I want to see him so bad. I just called him and he and Paul are going to the Casino. They were actually on their way out the door when I called. Hmm. I want to cry I miss him so much.   Well my tummy hurts from sleeping and I need some food in my stomach.

      Yesterday was a pretty bad day in the life of Audrey. I was very upset by a few things, including that of my soon-to-be fiancee calling me by his ex-girlfriend's name. Oh well, I guess we talked about it and he did repetatively aplogize. So all is (almost) well in the land of Adam and Audrey.   I had to give my communitcation skills speech today. I hate public speaking, but it went quite well. Part of the speech called for a brief biography of Amy Lowell, famous American poet. Well, in my speech I used the phrase 'obese aristocratic lesbian' My teacher liked this very much so because her being lesbian and/or obese was not mentioned in our books. Which means Audrey, being the smart girl she is, looked up more information on the computer. She commended me on a job well done.   Yay, I felt special.   Friday is Adam's and my 6 month anniversary. I'm on my period so no sex can occur, however we are cleaning out his closet (fun fun, rolls eyes) and hopefully I will get him to let us go on a walk or something...oooh maybe the beach. I hate being a hopeless romantic who is in love with a not so hopeless romantic. Ahhh. So is the ways of love.   Well I am going to go for now.

      He called me someone else's name. Granted he is drunk, but he did it twice in the same conversation. Someone being an ex-girlfriend. Ugh, why do I set myself up for this shit? The first time he said he didn't realize, but he caught himself saying it the second time.   Lots of ass kissing for him, I don't care if he is drunk and celebrating being done with school. Fuck you. Does this mean you have her on your mind? Ugh.   -Audrey

      Once upon a time there was this fat ass girl named Audrey. She had a few good friends, no boys ever bothered with her, she had nearly straight A's, the perfect family life, and was in control of every aspect of her life in which she wished to control. However, about 8 months ago, this girl, Audrey lost 67 pounds, got a job, and her life did a complete turn around. She started getting attention from guys, began doing more things with her 'friends' along the lines of drugs and alcohol, lost control of her emotions, began getting bad grades in school, and completely changed. She lost all control of everything. Her boyfriend Adam has it all. She is like a puppet on his string. She knows that she can easily get control, but questions if she really wants it. She is happy, in some senses. Happier in some ways then she was before, in other ways depressed.   Well that is a quick little bio about my life. My name is Audrey and I am 16. I live in Kingsford, Michigan where I am a Junior at Kingsford High School. I work at Shopko where I meant my now, wonderful boyfriend Adam. He quickly became a major part of my life when he proved to be my greatest source of happiness. I live in this shit ass town with my mother, dad, and my great grandma. My real dad (I was adopted by my step-father) lives with his girlfriend in the same town. I hardly ever see him or my sister or brother. My brother, Brian, will be 19 shortly before I turn 17. My sister, Jenell, just turned 10. My father is a reformed alcoholic, but not being a drunk ass, doesn't mean he is well in life. He is a major junkie. Doing anything from pot, to heroin, to cocaine.   Well thats my family, I am sure you will hear much more about them. Now, back to me. Like I said, I am 16, soon to be 17. I have a wonderful boyfriend, who promises me we will get married. Don't say anything about us being too young, you don't know us. He is 18 and will be graduating from KHS this May. I honestly love him more than anything. He is my savior.   I love music. Some main stream, some not so main stream. These are some of my favorite bands: Saosin, Matchbook Romance, Silverstein, Liz Phair, Smile Empty Soul, American HI-FI, Blink 182, Puddle of Mudd, Dashboard Confessional, Evanescence, The Eagles, Eve 6, Fefe Dobson, Finch, H.I.M., Hoobstank, Incubus, Jack off Jill, Kelly Osbourne, Linkin Park, Natalie Imbruglia, The Verve Pipe, Nickleback, Solar Twins, Papa Roach, Plumb, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Darkness, Everlast, Sheryl Crow, Taproot, Simple Plan, The Used, Filter, Limp Bizkit, The Wallflowers, and Trapt, Thursday, 3 Doors Down, No Doubt, Story of the Year, and Joss Stone. Among many others, seeing as music is one of my greatest passions.   I like writing. I haven't really written in a while. There are just too many confusing emotions going through me that I really can't identify between any of them. Creating some really fucked up shit.   Well this is all for now. My boyfriend (having a drinking problem) just called me on his cell phone from the middle of the woods. Piss drunk I may add. Ugh, now I am worried about him.   -Audrey
