      last night.  I spent the night at a next door neighbors house.  It was a lot of fun.  We hung out with some hotties from school, but they left really early and only styayed for about an hour.  I guess getting drunk is more fun than haning out with me and molly, whatever.  so after teh guys left me and molly called one of our friends adn we were acting SOO incredibly ditsy.  It was a lot of fun, he was getting SO annoyed though.  But the really funny part of our night came when we were making prank calls.  We looked through molly's year book adn called some of the numbers people left.  We tried to call this girl anemd Gina but a mexican guy answered the phone, we talked to him for about 20 minuites, and by the end of our convo he though we were on the way to his house to have sex.  It was great.  I'm not sure if he thought it was real or not, but it was  alot of fun messing with him.  HAHA  I'm so eman, oh well  shay*

      hmmm, it's a monday morning and my dad has just informed me that if I want a life I have to clean my room.  This could take a while considering I cna't see the floor and I don't have a small room.  I hate it when he does this.  Esspecially when I have plans.  school starts in three days(oh joy) and I haven't done ANY school shopping, all I want is some money and I'll be happy, but NO it takes much more than just a thankz to get money, it takes cleaning my room, cleaning my frog cage AND an extra chore.  Good gosh people what is this world coming to?  Oh, and I'm going to see a friend from school that I haven't seen all summer.  I'm kinda scared.  My best friend aleisha says she's changed a lot.  I don't want to like make a weird l;ook or funny face when I see her, but as far as I've heard she bleached her hair and gained 30 lbs.  And her grandpa used to drink a lot and be drunk when she got home from school, and so I'm kinda scared of him.  I love Kristin(my friend( to death but her sercumstances arn't the best.  I want the best for her adn that's why I'm gonig to her house.  Kristin has a lot on her plate right now, and I really wanna help her, but I don't know how.  she's bipolar, clinically depressed, adn she hears voices, oh and she has multiple personalities.  It's crazy all the junk she has gone through and has to put up with.  a ouple of months ago she tried to kill herself and that was a total shock to me adn I didn't know how to deal with it.  I want to treat her like all my other friends, but I'm afraid if I say something wrong she'll take it the wrong way.  I don't want to be at fault for her commiting suicide again.  so if you have any advice on how to "be" around her throw 'em at me.  :) Thanx. I'll catch ya lata'  Shay*

      so, it's been like 3 hours since I last wrote, but I have nothing better to do on a sunday night so...here I am yet again.  I hope I'm not just writing to myself and actually get someone to read them.  I told my good friend Carolyn about it, adn maybe she'll read it, but who knows.  If she does...I love her, adn I hope she likes the cookies I just brought her!  If anyone has seen "mikes super short shgow"  I think it's really annoying, like one of the most annoying shows I've ever seen.  actually I think it's kinda funny actually(wow I said that twice), cause the girl  on the show is the same girl who dances for missy elliot in her videos, lol.  "lol" I wonder who came up with that?  Back to the point.  I'll talk about my favorite tv shows.  I love 7th heaven, the things on the show would never happen in real life, but it's somewhat of a tennage soap opera, i guess thats why it's so entertaining.  speaking of TV I love going to the movies.  I don't know why, but I just LOVE going to the movies, it's just....fun.  Well, "family prayer" time.......yay(very sarcastic)  shay

      HOLY CRAP I'm so dumb.  I just messed up a perfectly writtem blog about perfectly nothing, but it was long and I jut spet like 30 min on it.  Now i'm pissed.  Great way to start out my blog i guess, lol.      Gosh, now I have to start all over again.  Belive me this is NOT gonna be as long as my last one cause my fingers hurt already.  My name is shay, I'm a 16 year old drama queen.  I'm not into drama or anything I just have a lot of it in my life.  I'm in a mormon family, which can sometimes be QUITE difficult, and I have four sibs and older brother adn sister(blah) and two younger brothers who drive me insane.  My parents are totally into our religion (which I'm not) and so is my older sister. I guess my topic of discussion today will be my sister.  She's obese(and I'm not just saying that)clinically depressed adn bipolar.  she's 17 and tries to act like my second mother.  She is so ahrd to live with I don't know how I've survived so many yuears.  She's been gone At my grandma's the whole summer adn just got back 2 days ago.  I wish she would leave again.  she ahtes me adn everything about me.  She always tells my mmom how much I messed up her life and how bad I am.  I guess I amy see like a problem child because she tries to be perfect but I'm not. she jst portrays me as the "bad" one.  She's always tellin me what to wear how to do my hair how to act, live, breath, eat, she wants to rule adn ruine every aspect of my life.  she always has to put her two cents in on EVERYTHING.  I's okay to have an opinion but I don't alwasy want to know what it is.  I'll write more about my sister later, but my fingers do really hurt so I'll catch ya later.  shay
