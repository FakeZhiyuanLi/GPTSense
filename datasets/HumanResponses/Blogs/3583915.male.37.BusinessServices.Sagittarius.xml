      Saturn Infolabs goes global by placing a central point for customer support and market expansion in the Middle East at Dubai.  Dubai embraces a wide variety of scenery in a very small area. In a single day, the tourist can experience everything from rugged mountains and awe-inspiring sand dunes to sandy beaches and lush green parks, from dusty villages to luxurious residential districts and from ancient houses with windtowers to ultra-modern shopping malls.  The emirate is both a dynamic international business centre and a laid-back tourist escape; a city where the sophistication of the 21st century walks hand in hand with the simplicity of a bygone era.  But these contrasts give Dubai its unique flavour and personality; a cosmopolitan society with an international lifestyle, yet with a culture deeply rooted in the Islamic traditions of Arabia.  Since earliest times, Dubai has been a meeting place, bringing together the Bedouin of the desert interior with the pearl-diver, the merchant of the city with the sea-going fisherman.   Having expanded along both banks of the Creek, Dubai’s central business district is divided into two parts — Deira on the northern side and Bur Dubai to the south — connected by a tunnel and two bridges. Each has its share of fine mosques and busy souks, of public buildings, shopping malls, hotels, office towers, banks, hospitals, schools, apartments and villas.  Outside this core, the city extends to the neighbouring emirate of Sharjah to the north, while extending south and west in a long ribbon of development alongside the Gulf, through the districts of Satwa, Jumeirah and Umm Suqeim.  &raquo; read more  urlLink http://www.saturninfolabs.com

      By the request from a client, the CTO and NC at saturn visited a  location for enhancing the existing network. The clients place being a  star hotel, had a bare minimum installation before. Again believing on  the existing cabling, new additions which were needed were planned in  and team from saturn went to the site.   Phew, first the existing switch was a blown one, then several of the  structured cables, which go through the walls were open somewhere, and  finally no 16 port switch was available in the local market.  The work is in a pending state.
