      An Interview that appears on Simon and Schuster's website...   A Conversation with Sarahbeth Purcell     Q: What inspires you to write, and why did you choose to develop this story in particular?   A: I was asked this question at a book signing that, with all the great questions, turned into a wonderful two hour discussion with readers in Atlanta a short time ago. I realized that very minute as I was explaining myself that those sort of exchanges are what inspire me to write. Conversations, ideas passed back and forth, thoughts that trickle in and out. Never something one hundred percent real. I write when I need to only. I can't write simply out of duty, and I refuse to write anything that I don't have a passion about.   Love is the Drug was a difficult story to write, but my father was ill and I decided in order to protect myself from the pain, as I often did when I was a little girl, I would imagine the worst case scenario and make up a story from that, to escape what was really happening. This book, first and foremost, was merely a survival tool. Just like when I was in high school and people teased me and I was miserable. My only escape then was theatre, music and writing so I could pretend my life at the time didn't exist.     Q: Tyler is a very strong personality. Have you ever known anyone like her? Are any of the events in this story adapted from real life?   A: There are similarities with events that happened in Tyler's childhood and events that happened in mine. I certainly used things as inspiration, but never never never used anyone else as a way to get my story across. I have to give myself more credit than that as an artist. I know of a lot of artists whether they be authors or painters or songwriters or playwrights that use their frustration, their failed relationships and anger at negative situations in their life as ammunition, as subject matter, and to me it's not an option. I don't have any respect for artists who do this, and I wouldn't respect myself if I did it. It's vampirism, pure and simple, to use people who are in or have moved out of your life and sell it to the highest bidder. Plus, to me, it would mean I had no real creativity, if I couldn't create something that didn't exist.   So yes, there are certain similarities but mostly in an interesting way I've only recently discovered: After I had written thoughts down as I was writing the book, some of the opinions and ideas became my own. I started quoting Tyler when I was having conversations with people. So I sort of stole from Tyler, not the other way around. I didn't create Tyler to be a stronger or weaker version of myself or to get back at a lover who scorned me, or to be a very sexual person by proxy and curse like a sailor and get away with it by claiming it's all a character. It's my belief that Tyler sort of always existed and I just told her story. And I admire her quite a lot, despite her weaknesses.     Q: Music and writing are both very important to Tyler. Do you think one of these media is more powerful than the other, or do they have different strengths? Which is more important to you?   A: I recently wrote an essay for Powell's about just this subject matter and I'll reiterate my point: Modern fiction today is so much more "punk rock" than music ever will be again. Musicians and songwriters tend to get so much overrated admiration or aberration, and so much attention, so of course authors end up being the glue that holds art together while the rockers get glory and ego strokes. I grew up in the music business and it's always been that way. Media isn't what it used to be. Eminem gets flack for controversial subject matter but no one really pays attention to what authors are writing unless it becomes a movie or it's by the "monarchy" of writers (Stephen King, John Grisham, J K Rowling, etc.) So the writers like myself who are a bit underground can actually change the very nature of the way a book is written and what is acceptable subject matter without being blocked by book burnings or too much negative attention. I love that I can mention music in the book and make the story about so much more than that as well. Music is like a spring of parsley while the story in a book is the whole bowl of hummus.  I've written songs and I've written books and I'll tell you immediately it is a hell of a lot more difficult to write a book. There are more elements to it. It's more cerebral. You have to be able to put a sentence together to do it. You have to have coherence. It's not a fast food version of a story like a song is. It doesn't matter if the author is young or old. Image means very little in the general scheme of things. Your gender doesn't matter. Of course, there are similarities between the two mediums and I do seek out music that resembles the books I like to read. Full of layers. Whether it's a book or a song, it can't just be about love. It can't just be about death. I hate over simplified love stories or songs. How much has that been overdone at this point? So he left you and you're lonely. Boo-hoo. Tell a story people haven't heard before in some new way people haven't heard it. That is what I've always tried to do.     Q: Tyler's lists are fun to read, and drive some of the plot in the second half of the book. Did you find it difficult to work within that framework after awhile, or did that device help you?    A: For me, the lists were so necessary. As I wrote them, they became like a separate breathing vessel, a life support for the story. They are what Tyler depended on with her life, literally. They are what people depend on to mark accomplishments in real life. Lists can be in many different forms, whether on paper or mental notes. The first impression you get of someone begins a list of ways you get to know a person. Life is a list, isn't it? Years and years of lists of things you do in a day, of people you meet, of thoughts you have, of experiences you make your own. So to me, lists are never ending. They didn't begin for me or those characters with this book, and they don't end on the last page.     Q: Tyler's relationships with men are complicated. Do you think her perceptions of men are accurate, or that they say more about Tyler than they do about men in general?   A: I think Tyler is so hurt, and so in need of a sense of belonging to something that she treats herself like an object that might belong to a man. She thinks so much more of others than herself that even when it's clear that David or Perry or her father have been unfair to her, she blames herself and continues to try to be more and more of their perfect idea of a human being. She loves the idea of someone claiming her, and you do tend to want to remind her that she isn't a piece of luggage. Of course, she also resents specific men for the way she allows them to treat her, but she is clear headed enough not to blame all men for this. Tyler's relationship with her father, when she compares him to a sad b-side on a cassette says it all to me. Tyler accepts less than she deserves and gives more than she should and it makes her lonely but hopeful.     Q: Geography-distinctive locales like Nashville, Memphis, and Los Angeles-contributes to a highly nuanced setting for Tyler's story. What significance do these places have for you?    A: Nashville is my hometown, and a beautiful, lush city full of culture no one wants to acknowledge because it's in the south and it is considered the home of country music. I will always be grateful for having grown up in Nashville as a child. It's down to earth, unpretentious, and full of secret jewels and stories and character. Anyone who thinks you need to live in NYC to be an artist of any sort is naïve and a cliché.   Los Angeles is a beautiful place, but sometimes it can be like a beautiful flower: pretty to look at, but dangerous to get close enough to pick. Every time I go to LA, I think for about two seconds that time has stopped and I will be young and pretty and free forever and that it will never rain and nothing will go wrong. And I love that feeling, but it is fleeting, like having a crush on someone you will never speak to.   Memphis is to me, what I am so glad Nashville never became. It's a place that has a rich history, but has yet to modernize itself enough to catch up and get out from under its own fable. I used to go there quite a bit with my father when he worked in music, and it's a melancholy place really. To me Memphis represents what Tyler feels at first: she wants to move on but she doesn't know how to just get up out of bed and go forward.      Q: Tyler struggles with depression and alcoholism. Many readers will empathize with Tyler, or think of a loved one as they read about her. Was it difficult for you to write about these aspects of Tyler's character?    A: I think anyone in human existence at this point has come in contact with someone who has been terribly affected by both diseases. Depression, I think, is an evil secret epidemic because it's still considered to be embarrassing, no one is supposed to admit they deal with it, and few people realize it can certainly prove to be a very fatal disease, just like cancer. It's hard to write about in a sensitive way without making the character sound self-pitying, but I think Tyler comes across as a person who is just as confused by it as anyone else.   Alcoholism is the terminal sad story. Most times if not all, depression and alcoholism are present together. I really despise the way most of the media deals with alcoholism, like it's either something horribly scandalous or absolutely hilarious. You see the mugshots of fallen stars arrested for drunk driving, and you see the token drunk characters in movies all the time, and we're supposed to laugh and be oh-so-relieved it isn't us. The funny part is, it's most of us, most of us have some sort of an issue with lack of moderation of some sort or another. I think if we as human beings spent more time and money trying to work on ways to manage depression and addiction in society, we would all be healthier people and society would be less bankrupt in every way. Aren't the homelessness and unemployment issues largely due in part to both diseases? More acceptance, more funding for help with these issues from the government, and education would put us forward to where we should be, which is on some path to conquering these problems. Until then, it's important to write and read about, if nothing else to make it less taboo, and to gain some sort of understanding.     Q: Is there an idea or concept that you would like your readers to come away with after having read your novel? Are there any themes that you hope will shine through for them?   A: I hope that anyone who reads Love is the Drug will see that it can be about anyone, with any list they have. It doesn't have to be gender specific, or sexually specific, or geographically specific. It's not even about love and heartbreak or death. It's about becoming a whole person, or at the very least trying to. It's about breaking cycles and sometimes repeating them, it's about being honest with every aspect of our lives, it's about the necessity to find humor in every single situation just to make it through. It's about a girl trying to deal with losing two people she never really had in the first place, and learning to refuse to accept so little from other human beings. It's about learning your own definition of contentment and striving for that one thing with grace.    For Atom enabled feed, click here:   urlLink ATOM FEED

        urlLink sarahbeth's photo gallery    the cat, she caught a baby bunny last night and his head was ripped clean off like a beheaded promise that someone might have once made.  the guts of everything comes out the neck of the thing in the end, and just like that in the soft glow from the porch light i see the intricacies and false hopes in the body of the promise, that the poor thing's heart was only the size of my thumb anyway, and "i will" and "i love you" are less than the size of a pinkie.  his and my fingers have always been the undoing.    i shouldn't have let the cat out to do their dirty work, i know it, but she is a predator after all, and she (and he) just slipped right out the screen door through my legs, i had no control, it wasn't my fault, i swear it.  i meant just to let them be free for a moment, because they were climbing the walls and started scratching and biting and giving me all sorts of hell, bruises they said were accidental and look what's happened now.   like someone else i maybe once knew, maybe i still know him, maybe he just doesn't ever want anyone to know him because he thinks it is too ugly, his bloodlust, his need to feed off other living beings.  he and the cat need to destroy in order to live.  and now they're both stuck indoors most times and so are therefore forced to destroy little bits of themselves instead to protect life surrounding them.  there are so many pieces missing by now.  i still find fur on my pillow.   so when they get out of their self imposed prisons, watch out.  you're not safe, even hiding quietly in trees.  i should know.  i had become very skilled at climbing trees.  and still...they will find you and when they catch you, they will bring you in front of everyone like a trophy, carrying your limp but beautiful body in their mouths, and all the other cats will think you such a delicious catch and be so jealous of him and her, oh were they ever jealous.    they will say the bunny was already killed maybe, that other cats have caught her, that she was a weak bunny, she is a controlling and convoluted bunny, she had a lame leg, it will never last, cat, so give it up.  they know the cat has hunting problems, oh so many problems, that the poor thing has never before this caught anything worth eating, and yet their envy is so great, they just can't encourage him to be happy with the hunt.  they  must convince him there are better bunnies.  that maybe no bunny will ever be enough.  that he must prowl alone.  i suspect they secretly wanted the bunny for themselves...or for him to leave it for the coyotes to claim, because after all, the cat's catch makes all of their mice and moles look so paltry.  he slayed the bunny last night and my head went rolling into the woods.   clean off.   he says he won't he won't he refuses to do so simply because i asked, like a child who will not go to bed, will tell you he is not sleepy, nope, not sleepy and passes out cold on his blanket five minutes later.  and the moment gets lost.  that damn child missed out on his bedtime story because he was too stubborn to let me tuck him in.  lost in dreams now, running outside to play with imaginary friends, i suspect the cats have convinced him it's for the best.  the bunny wasn't worth it.  and when they all bring their moles and insects and mice and birds in front of him, parade their catches with puffed out chests, he will feel a twinge, maybe an ache, maybe even a stabbing pain of regret.  and my head will be rolling.  a trophy, maybe the best catch ever, is lost to pride.  damn that cat and his pride.

      A love struck Romeo sings the streets a serenade  He's laying everybody low  He's got a love song that he made  He finds a convenient streetlight and he steps out of the shade  And says something like  "You and me, babe, how about it?"   Juliet says, "Hey, it's Romeo!  You nearly gave me a heart attack"  Yeah well, he's underneath the window now she's singing,  "Hey, la, my boyfriend's back  You shouldn't come around here singing up to people like that"  Oh anyway whatcha gonna do about it?

Now you can fall for chains of silver  And you can fall for chains of gold  You fall for pretty strangers  And the promises they hold  Well you promised me everything and then you promised me thick and thin  But now you just turn away and you say,  "Romeo, I think I used to have a scene with him..."   Oh Juliet  When we made love you used to cry  You said "I love you like the stars above  Gonna love you till I die"  There's a place for us  I know you know this song  Now when you gonna realize  It was just that the time was wrong  Julie  I'm so in love...

      Some people liken human behavior to animal behavior.  I've just moved and after having spent a bit of time digging and planting, I liken it more to plants.  Some people are roses.  They need lots of sun and water and to be the spotlight of the garden, but they are easy to figure out.  They are ordinary, really.  Maybe pretty, but ordinary.  I know lots of daisies and lilies, cute but a bit predictable, and I know some unfortunate creeping phlox, that comes back year after year, and looks beautiful at first but drowns out anything around it eventually.  Like ivy.  Even if it's not poison.  Especially if it's not poison.  It's ground cover and it does its job and everyone thinks it beautiful while it quickly creeps and strangles everything around it.  Ivy becomes something no one can control at this point, and it hides snakes and ticks within and suffocates other life beneath, and moves up walls and big old brick houses, eating the mortar from the inside out.    I've always thought the idea of flowers can be so sad, just like people you love and lose, that you can plant and tend to them and spend years watching them become something of beauty, a place to sit under and enjoy the shade, and one week of inattention, one season of freezing weather, one small factor can kill the entire living thing.  And it's gone.  Just like that.  The gardener is heartbroken.  Devastated.  Everything she did, all the nights she ran outside barefoot with blankets to protect it from the cold, the hot blistering days she spent snipping back disease, the days she decided to forgo the fast fresh cut flowers in favor of looking at the prospects in the back yard...And just like that, the plant gives in to mother nature.  And I see it dying.  And there's nothing I can do anymore.     For Atom enabled feed, click here:   urlLink ATOM FEED

      I just finished reading  urlLink A Million Little Pieces  by James Frey.  An amazing book.  I am guilty of being a reader who travels with some sort of pen, usually black, underlining meaningful passages in any book I read, meaningful lines, what have you.  I could flip through this now that I am finished and see pages of black.  A must read.  Truly.  Having wrapped up edits on book number 2, I am in writing mode still.  And while I wait for a return on those edits, while I wait for more work on book two, I have been toying with the idea of working with some ideas that have been swimming in my head.  What else is swimming in my head right now:  -My mother has been very ill lately has been watching far too much TV since she became nearly immobile.  She called me last night and begged me to turn the television on to MTV.  We watched Ashlee Simpson's reality TV show together by phone.  Sick, isn't it?  We're more like sisters than mother and daughter, though.    Anyway, I noticed that young little Ashlee has a new record contract and all these exciting things going for her and she drops her boyfriend's (or is it ex-boyfriend now...gasp!)name every other word (along with  like  and  oh my god ) and obsesses about where he is, what he is thinking, if he is thinking of her, and talks about how all the songs she writes are about him, and on and on and on and I see with this why young girls and boys in their adolescent naivety prime should NEVER be given television shows.  She is going to watch this show in two years and cringe.  She is probably already watching this behavior and cringing.  I think the moment you make your talent, your art, the thing you do in life all about someone else, the moment you mix up events of your romantic life with what you do and use them as an indicator and also as a publicity tool, you have lost it all.  And coincidentally, she lost her boyfriend before the end of the episode.  Coincidence?  I think not.    -I was recently given a bit of an indicator of how weird people get about personal relationships of anyone whose name is anything of note, and it totally freaked me out.  I had no idea anyone paid attention to, and especially commented publicly about me or my boyfriend, or about our personal relationship...But they do apparently.  And it's not like either one of us are famous in any way.  Of course, we are talking about chat rooms and those bulletin board things online and all that sort of fringe of society behavior that I don't pay attention to anyway.  Although I hear so far the assumptions and tabloid type discussions about me online on those things are for the most part all complementary, (even if they have no truth) I have plenty of real friends in my life, so what some total stranger who has never met me says to other tabloid believing chatters on a chat room about me or my boyfriend or my relationship (all of which they have no real idea about) or what I must really be like doesn't exactly hold any weight with me.  He recently made me aware of this bizarre phenomenon when he was told by someone else we were being "dished" about online, and gave me some good advice.  None of those people have ever met us (no matter what they say to the contrary), they don't know us (especially not the ones who spend their lives on a chat room talking about us...I mean, how many of our real friends would report all about us online?), they've been telling lies about him for eons now and he just ignores it, and basically, consider the source.  Consider the source.  I guess you can just feel sorry for them if you care enough.  Strange.  -There should be a few changes up on my website soon.  Look for a new "photo gallery" button, to see pictures from booksignings, roadtrips to booksignings and high adventure.  The fun never stops.  -I don't ever want to work a day job again.  This is my number one goal right now.  Of course, I don't ever want to work a night job either.  No bartending, no waiting tables, no office politics and answering phones and typing and showing up eight minutes late to work every day and getting bitched out by the boss lady for the millionth time because I just can't seem to care enough about the job to want to be there at 8:00 on the dot.  Jesus.  8:00 AM is too early to be at an office making coffee and answering phones anyway.  Actually, to be honest, I began showing up to work late at that particular office job a year and a few months ago after I returned back to work when my father had died very suddenly.  My heart was still not in being at the office when I was still mourning my father, and I was told I only had two or three days "bereavement" time or whatever it is they call it, which means she was basically saying I took too long to grieve because I stayed away from work longer than that, and was accusing me of slacking off when actually my father was dead and I was trying to come to grips with the fact that I was twenty-five and my father was only fifty-one and I would never see him for the rest of my life.  She didn't understand.  She had both of her parents still.  No one who hasn't lost a parent understands what it's like.  They just don't.  You just don't know what it's like until it happens.  It doesn't matter under what circumstances it happened.  It really doesn't.  It's just catastrophic regardless.  This is why I found my lip trembling and big fat wet tears rolling down my cheeks the other night when  Fields Of Dreams  was on TV.  This is why.  I will never work in an office again.   I hope.      For Atom enabled feed, click here:   urlLink ATOM FEED

      I think I have book editing to the brain.  I need to refocus here.  But before I do...  - I am going over this book, right now, Book # 2, this book that will be my next release, this book I admittedly really do love and always have, this book I wrote years ago actually and I am finding the most eerie, unnerving coincidences in it to my very recent life with characters I wrote about who I now know. I feel like a clairvoyant, where I write about people who I then come to meet later.  If people who are close to me didn't know that I had written this book years ago, they would think some of it was based on truth.  This has happened before this book with other things I've written.  So I of course worry it might happen after this book, which makes me want to write next about the most kind, forgiving, loving people who surround me with sunshine and rainbows.  Okay, maybe not that far, but you get the picture.  There are far too many prophecies come true in this one.  The sex of the character might be different, or the exact circumstance, but it's just strange.  Maybe I've just been staring at the computer screen too long.  Who knows.  -I want to personally, right now, thank Bonnie, who bid on and won an autographed copy of my book on the  urlLink PETA auction  held recently (some of which is still going on, featuring Stella McCartney among others).  All of that money is going to a very worthy, very important cause, and I want to thank you personally for your interest in both the animals and in little old me.  Your book, I hear, is on its way.  -I miss some things right now.  Some things I don't miss.  I can't decide sometimes which parts are worth missing and which parts need to be exorcised.  Do you ever feel like you are having an out of body experience ALL THE TIME?  That's the way I've always felt. Sometimes I come home late at night and just sit on the front stoop of my house for a minute before I go inside and I look out at the rabbits playing in my yard and the flowers and I breathe the summer air and I think on all the fortunate opportunities I've had in my life, it all feels like enough maybe.  Then other times I sit at night on my little deck in the back and stare into the darkness of the bushes and trees and I see lightning bugs, these bugs that used to make me so happy and excited and I just wonder...What happened to everything?  What is missing?  There's this piece.  And I can't seem to find it lately.  The words are really on my side tonight with the manuscript I'm editing, so I must go again.  I am going back to the book I love.  The other things that maybe I once had or that are just plain missing... Hopefully they'll come in time.   urlLink colorado holiday pictures    urlLink what authors do when they're not writing?     For Atom enabled feed, click here:   urlLink ATOM FEED

      Home again...Listening to Tom Petty.  Trying to catch up on edits for book number two.  I have promised myself I will finish them in record time with startlingly fantastic results.  Hmmm...Overachiever much?  "Somewhere, somehow somebody Must have kicked you around some Tell me why you wanna lay there And revel in your abandon?"  Tom Petty is America's best songwriter, hands down, and that includes all those overrated artists anyone mentions.  Dylan, Springsteen, Lennon.  Come on.  Get off the bandwagon already.  Petty has for longer than anyone in at least fifty years written poignant lyrics, along with the best damn rock 'n roll music around.  He is not bitter or jaded, he is not in Victoria's Secret commercials (ahem) he has not used causes or sex or martyrdom or what critics have to say to boost his appeal, he doesn't flit around in leather pants and frou-frou hair-dos, he isn't an overdramatic, overly sensitive, whiny artist, he isn't a diva, he doesn't expect everyone to forgive him of bad performances or tantrums, he doesn't jump on bandwagons and he has never acted like the world owed him anything. He is the consummate professional.  I have seen him perform live countless times with not one "off" night.  And he doesn't give a shit what you think.  He is a rock 'n roll star, but more importantly, he is a talented artist with a great voice and better sense and resiliency than critical darlings and the next big things.  And for some reason, I thought that should be said.   Also, I have returned from a holiday of sorts that included the whole spectrum of adventure.  Feel free to peruse the photo diary below to see for yourself.  I must get back to work.  Must create...Must write and like the results...Must eat at some point and remember to water plants...Must finish edits...Must finish edits...     urlLink Sarahbeth's recent photos   For Atom enabled feed, click here:   urlLink ATOM FEED

       Fahrenheit 911 : Saw it&nbsp;the other day with boyfriend.&nbsp; Everyone should see the proof of the other side to the lies we've been told for so long. We were both so disturbed after watching it, we couldn't sleep.    San Francisco:&nbsp; Went a few weeks back to visit boyfriend while he was touring on West Coast&nbsp;for a mini-vacation and to sign some books while I was there.&nbsp; I've been there before, but now I remember why I don't go often.&nbsp; It was cold, rainy, overpriced, dirtier than any city I've ever been to (except maybe Nuevo Laredo, but close), the traffic and parking and drivers are terrible...No offense to San Franciscans, but the city needs a major overhaul.&nbsp; I did get to see the old castle my parents lived in during the seventies with a bunch of crazy rockstars and I did meet a fan of the musician my boyfriend was playing with at The Independent club who was totally sweet.&nbsp; He wanted to get a photo with me and proceeded to tell me that I was a "total package" being a writer and "intelligent,&nbsp;beautiful, and friendly"&nbsp;and so on, which was very sweet, especially coming from a guy who has a boyfriend.&nbsp; Not trying to get me in bed (obviously) he&nbsp;had no reason to kiss my ass, so it was a well received compliment.&nbsp; Sometimes when you're cold and tired and feeling a bit droopy,  compliments will get you everywhere, darling.     Ocoee :&nbsp;Went whitewater rafting and camping at Ocoee, TN&nbsp;in boyfriend's '76 VW vanagon for his birthday a few days ago.&nbsp; I fell out of the raft at the&nbsp;Broken Nose rapids.&nbsp; I did not break my nose, though.&nbsp; Thankfully.&nbsp; I am a kick-ass camper, I must say.&nbsp;    This Is Not A Love Song : The new book...Still working on edits.&nbsp; I hope to finish very soon.&nbsp;    Love Is The Drug, The Paperback: &nbsp; Will be out February 2005.&nbsp; Got a sneak peek at the new cover concept from my editor last week.&nbsp; It is VERY different from the first one.&nbsp;...Stay tuned.    Lots of Cooking:   -Wilted spinach with lemon and garlic and a little olive oil  -Quiche with a potato crust and sundried tomatoes, onions, veggie bacon and Gruyere and Romano cheese  -My favorite comfort meal: Vega chicken noodle casserole  And none of it compares to my mother's Tomato Spice Dressing.&nbsp; I could pour that stuff over a hairbrush and eat it.   &nbsp;   Reading:  Do It!&nbsp; Let's Get Off Our But's (still...very involved, but very good), Tao Te Ching    Thinking:  About lots of things...Summer is nice but then there is that depressing transitional time that happens right before back to school where it's still very warm but&nbsp;you know it won't be long before the wind starts up, the mornings get cooler, the evenings sometimes get downright cold, flowers and leaves die, and things start to change.&nbsp;  Things always change , don't they?&nbsp; Why, after this long in my life of being constantly ripped out of the ground and transplanted and rearranged, always the changes are still the hardest?&nbsp; Even just seasons, just that simple change gets to me.&nbsp; I just sometimes wish that for a little while longer I could count on things, anything really,&nbsp;to remain the same.    John Kerry: &nbsp; I'm impressed.&nbsp; If you didn't see his speech at the Democratic National Convention, go to his website ( urlLink http://www.johnkerry.com ) and read his views and policies.&nbsp; No matter who you plan to vote for, you can't deny his importance in the race.    Ebay:  Still love it.&nbsp; I have bought and sold the weirdest crap on there.&nbsp; Anyone want a half-used bottle of lotion that I don't like the smell of anymore? (Just kidding...)    Sleep : The best drug on earth.    Root Canals :&nbsp; With root canal number six now under my belt, I am officially an old pro at this.&nbsp; Today they sealed it all up now that the infection is lowered&nbsp;and put a stainless steel temporary on.&nbsp; The gums are bloody and swollen,&nbsp;my jaw is sore, and I can't chew on that side until my "new" tooth comes in (isn't that strange..."comes in"...Arrives on a truck of some sort and then is cemented in my mouth??)&nbsp; Two more weeks of right side eating.&nbsp; Hereditary health and dental issues suck.   Just random thoughts to keep me occupied.&nbsp; That's what life is about, I suppose.    For Atom enabled feed, click here:    urlLink ATOM FEED

      I'm singing Carpenters tunes in my head.&nbsp; Pharmaceuticals are&nbsp;trickling through my body, and yes, they are prescribed, and no, I am not a pill popper.&nbsp; I don't like feeling out of it like this at all.  &nbsp;  I am due for dental surgery tomorrow and currently am trying to maintain a straight face while there is throbbing pain in my right upper jaw.&nbsp; I went to the dentist bright and&nbsp;early this morning&nbsp;and after she took x-rays and found the source of the pain, she set&nbsp;up an endodontist appointment for tomorrow afternoon.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The endodontist performs root canals every day, all day.&nbsp; That's all they do.&nbsp; They will shoot my gums with novacaine,&nbsp;drill my tooth open, saw it down to a nub, scrape out all the diseased pulp, and fill it with fake pulp stuff, push tiny pins into the root system to make sure the roots are filled, push those pins in and out, in and out, while they make this sort of "eee-ahh-eee-ahh" noise that makes me think of squeaky clean tupperware&nbsp; just washed, and then put on a temporary tooth until my dentist fits me for a crown a few weeks later.&nbsp; Because of the placement of the tooth and because my roots are small and hard to get to and basically knarly and require special attention (I've had 3 root canals in one other&nbsp;tooth before) and because I have no health insurance (because I am an author and therefore self-employed and therefore health insurance is ridiculously expensive for people like me, and don't even get me started on how much I hate the fact that people who need healthcare the most do not usually get it and how much this country needs an organized form of healthcare and dental care) and because the tooth is basically screwed beyond repair and I do not want it pulled (because then it will mess up all my other teeth and so on and so forth), I am going to a specialist tomorrow to scrape out all the insides and make a new internal root system and then back to my dentist to put on a fake tooth and pretend it never happened.&nbsp; I have done this before.&nbsp; This is not new to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;   Having a root canal:&nbsp; About $2,000 bucks    Getting rid of this pain: Priceless   &nbsp;  Actually, I don't know about the priceless part.&nbsp; Do you know what you can do with $2000.00?&nbsp; Especially if you stretch it out?&nbsp; I keep thinking of TempurPedic beds I want and another touch up Lasik surgery and trips to Aruba and how I don't really (forgive me) even know where Aruba is.&nbsp; I keep wishing I had perfect teeth that never required this sort of special attention.  &nbsp;  I am getting very personal here, I know, but I think a lot of people can relate.&nbsp; Maybe it's just the painkillers talking but...Dentistry is nice and all, but what did we do before all of this technology?&nbsp; No one cared if they had crooked teeth or only two teeth.&nbsp; It was part of the human condition.&nbsp; Who else thinks it's abnormal to keep a dead tooth and fill it in with cement and cover it with a fake tooth to pretend it still serves a purpose?  &nbsp;  I have also realized over a few days time that no matter how adult you are about something, no matter how you let things go, over and over again, no matter how zen and forgiving you are, no matter how you try to remedy situations by being kind and facing them, by doing what is right, by being graceful and forthright, some people are just poisonous.&nbsp; There are people in the world who are so soulless, so empty and full of lies and&nbsp;envious and hateful, that they will always try to damage anyone they encounter who is better off out of spite.&nbsp; They know they will never be repaired, so they try to destroy anything good in their path.&nbsp; I tried recently, after too much time of being&nbsp;assaulted by a poisonous&nbsp;one of these&nbsp;sorts,&nbsp;(as small as the assault was, because she matters so little in the general scheme of things) to be an adult, to try to see the humanity in someone else, to reach out a hand and be the bigger person, and I got what I knew she had inside.&nbsp; More poison.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I would feel sorry for this vessel of negativity if I thought she had a soul&nbsp;inside to pity.&nbsp; Instead, I am left with the truth.&nbsp; There is nothing there, and so there is nothing to feel&nbsp;sorry for.&nbsp; Those close to me, especially the one who loves me most know this to be the case already.&nbsp; I had been warned before.&nbsp; They manage to maintain a safe distance.&nbsp; They don't let her know what they know about her, and so I believe she thinks she has allies in them.&nbsp; I had been told about her insanity, her jealously, her unbelievable dysfunctions, and still I suppose I wanted to believe that every human being had a purpose.&nbsp; But now I realize that some people are just here to waste oxygen and try to cause problems.&nbsp; And&nbsp;it was merely human of me to defend myself after&nbsp;constant unwarranted&nbsp;hatefulness, but when I did, when I confronted the beast and&nbsp;wanted to understand a reasoning for the hideous and childish behavior she displays, I also realized, after being reminded by the one who loves me that these types are useless to try and be adult with.&nbsp; You can't argue with crazy.&nbsp; This kind is so menial, that&nbsp;isn't my problem.&nbsp;Let her be a flea on a dog somewhere else.&nbsp; I've got better things to swat at.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm sure I'll have to run into her again at some point in the near future, but now I feel satisfied.&nbsp; Now I understand.&nbsp; I can smile at her the next time she or a kind like her are trying to suck the life out of the room, and I now know that whatever happens, you can either&nbsp;complain about the stench or you can&nbsp;stay away from trash.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm babbling a bit, I know, and it is probably that these tooth soothers are also a bit of truth serum and maybe I feel strongly enough about what I learned to share it with you, because we all have had the misfortune to meet people like this.&nbsp; The moral of this story is:  &nbsp;  This kind, these moral prostitutes need not bother you.&nbsp; They self destruct on their own.&nbsp; Pay attention to more important matters.&nbsp; Bottom feeders like this will live the rest of&nbsp;their miserable lives eating their own&nbsp;shit in the murky depths, while if you stay as far away as possible,&nbsp;you will continue to swim to the top...Where life is going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For Atom enabled feed, click here:    urlLink ATOM FEED

      Writing.  That's what I've been doing if anyone asks.  Not going out all the time or hanging out by the TV watching soap operas, I have been really really focusing on the new book and editing my little butt off.    THIS IS NOT A LOVE SONG  This will most likely be the title.  Not Let It Bleed, as once planned.  I really like the new title.  People keep calling and inviting me out.  People I want to hang out with.  Things I want to do.  But I can't.  I'm in a zone.  I only stopped a minute ago to write this, because I want to update readers on what's going on in the process.  That is, after all, the real reason I keep this online diary.    I'm not interested in telling everyone and anyone who wants to know every detail about my personal life,(and obviously from what you've read in my blogger I don't).  Moreso, the blogger is here because when I like something someone writes or created in some form, I want to know a little about the artist's process, their experiences, maybe a little about them in the artistic sense.  I don't want to know their dirty laundry.  Just maybe more about how they create.  So that's what I'm trying to do here, right?!?  I am very very happy with what I'm working with here on the new book.  So excited about it.  One of my friends recently said the coolest thing about my writing.  He said he liked my work a lot, because it was like architecture.  That it was building up to create something larger.  Pretty good line, huh?  He is a songwriter and has some pretty damn good lines himself in his songs, so I am flattered.  Architecture is apparently his favorite pastime, the study of it, and so on.  So if my work reminds him of his favorite thing, that's a very very nice compliment.  I really do need to go.  I'm sorry.  I just have to finish this.
