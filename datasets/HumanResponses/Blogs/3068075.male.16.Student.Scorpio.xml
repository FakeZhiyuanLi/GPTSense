      So I am still unemployed. Is this a bad thing? This is a question I have been pondering For much of my unemployed time. On one hand, I have no money so that is bad. On the other hand, I don't have to concern myself with finding an ass manager. So that's good.

      Girl: Slow down. I'm scared. Guy: No, this is fun. Girl: No, it's not. Please, it's too scary! Guy: Then tell me you love me. Girl: Fine, I love you. Slow down! Guy: Now give me a BIG hug. - Girl hugs him - Guy: Can you take my helmet off & put it on yourself? It's bugging me. - Girl does -  In the paper the next day: A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of brake failure. Two people were on it, but only one survived.  The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy had realized that his brakes broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him & felt her hug one last time, then had her wear his helmet so that she would live, even though it meant that he would die.

      Right now there's a money spider on my arm. It's difficult with a money spider on your arm. You wouldn't realise how difficulst it is to do things you always took for granted, when you have a money spider on your arm. For instance it's a pain typing right now, as I have to make sure he (or she) remains on top of my arm - i dont want him (or her) falling off. Umm, fuck, I just tried to nudge it a bit and I, um, squashed it.  Sorry.  But maybe money spiders aren't so lucky after all, eh?

      So. Fuck, fuck, fuck. I have to write a report on the aforementioned 'Tick Borne Diseases in Canada'; a subject about which I know nothing. I have until friday to do this and Oh My God I have no idea where to start. Wish me luck.
