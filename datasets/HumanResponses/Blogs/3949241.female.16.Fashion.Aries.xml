      Today was fun!!! I woke up in the morning and I went with mom to pick up the gray truck from EDDIE who took it on purpose you know... !!!!!!after that i went strait to skool... funny thing was i came with food... i was the only asshole who seems to have the curtesy to BRING food.... and they ate it all!! ... registration was like okay today... it was my second day, and it was even more hectic than the day before...but it didnt really seem to matter to meeh, i was really looking forward to the CAMP we were having at the end of the day!!!. WHICH turned out to be PRETTY boring .. i mean, i got to meeet and see Faleomavaega Eni Hunkin.. his stuff was REALLY long.. and i was like oh my gosh.. isnt this shit supposed to be FUN!!! and entertaining!?!?! nah but he was really cool and he meant the right things! he mostly talked about how he turns to read the scriptures when ever he needs help! but well i guess ill try that.. and all..Johnny came late.. due to damn Football practice... and oh yeah. need i mention that their are NOOO cute guys up in here.. and all.. i got soo mad!!! but yeah thats my day.. and thats the result of all the frustration i had seemed to have  recieved due to fact that nothing really was going my  WAY!!!! so im b's'ing when i said it was fun... it SUCK !!!!

      oh wells, im AGAIN stuck here in american samoa with nothing new happening! anyways... im like getting a BIT tired of my grandmother.... She wants a lot of things done her way!!!! i mean it good to KNOW WHAT you WANT, but if it means that someone else is going to be put to damn SLAVE labor... then HeLL no!!!  She is also soooo unappreciative! she makes me drive everywhere and then has me do all her feaus but she never gave me a BREAK!!!! i swear!... anywho, i saw this one friend of mine at ACE.. well he just so happens to work there! and oh, HE IS FoInE! but yeah.. somehow NO ONE else seems to think the same.. but watch, in a year they are all going to start HuNTiNG for the poor boy. Well that means that i should just GET HIM NOW!!! LoL... Oh yeah, eddie (brother) gave me a WACKED ASS haircut!!! it was all good until he took matter into his own hands and tried this *FUTURISTiC look* but then i took charge a little too late.. but now my hair dont look all that SHITTY!!!!! i swear!..

      well, i guess a good hi is in order.. "hi" um... yeah.. well just wanted to say how boring it has been. Its been almost 3 months and i havent done anything fun at all!!!! this summer has been REALLY boring!! lol.. i cant wait for the camp thats happening, but in a way it is kinda stupid. Get this: The Department of Education is hosting a camp for all officers of each school to get some "tips" on how to lead their class... THEY ARE GOING TO TELL US WHAT TO DO, basically they want it done their way!.. i mean, i think LEADERS arent made, they are BORN! damn, im next years Student Body Vice P. and im also going to be a junior! the last thing i need is for someone to boss me around.. lol... eh, ill post later though.. LoL...

      Well, its been 3 days since camp finished.. and let meeh tell you this, i miss it like CRAZY!!! if only it could have gone on for a whole week. it was great there! no parentals, and the advisors were really LeNieNT towards our attitude and misbehavior! LoL... i miss the girls, the grass, the COLD showers, the Advisors, the fun activities, the SeSSioNs, everything... i mean, it aint all the nice to start enjoying something and then have it taken away from you... anywho, one thing i miss the most are the BOYS!!!!! omg, i got a story!!! and here it goes... when i first came to that camp, i met two special people that i fell in love with immediately and i shall never forget, Ammon & Fidel!! Aamon was a person who was not afraid to be who SHE is... and fidel: quiet and humble, was like a big SiSTeR to meeh.. i felt safe around her! and of course there was johnny so i had a BLAST! the nights there felt like a sleep over party!!! .... okay. funny thing is, our first nite there, the advisors split up the *gUrLs* from the bois... and alongside the advisors were FiDeL and JoHnNy!!!! ammon and I were totally against the whole idea and were totally bummed out the first night... well well well... that wasnt the same story with the second night... IT WAS SOOOO FUN!!! on the second day, the boys were wacky ( like boys) and i didnt seem to mind. I have a few of my OWN boys at school and i know exactly how to handle them, let em be. Well i guess, i had the same effect on these male species and of course they stopped teasing and started respectin meeh.. which is all i want from them.. and NOTHING ELSE ;)... oh gosh, and the second nite...was like the first time i had ever recieved a massage from anyone... poor evan, (another long story... fun one too! LoL) he straight up gave me a GREAT back massage, this is after i gave him one. I sorta gave him like the whole treatment. And as usual he was in a state of bliss!!! or so it seemed like it. um... i really miss him and the guys tho', we spent the whole nite talking and thats it.. we had a session of Q's & A's... and then it went vice-versa. I felt at home with their pleasantness... then theres the time we played dare and then started talking about gurls.. i swear! LoL... if the other *gurls* were up to it.. i would have held a little pageant that nite!!!! LoL... have the boys judge.. LoL.. ( of course then i would win!!! LoL... ) then at like 3 in the morning, the GURLS havent gone to sleep YET.. unbelievable.. so by that time, it was  meeh, johnny, ammon, dentley, and evan who were still up! but yeah.. shit happens!?!?!? LMAO!!! no.. NOTHING HAPPENED!!! choo hoo!!! LoL.. the next day, i realized like 2 hours after i woke up that we were going to leave each other and go our seperate ways... i cried like a bitch in the showers... i was soooooo sad...  somehow, i learned to love all these guys and gurls, ( yes, even "T" ) and i didnt want to leave!!!! so i shed my tears in the COLD ass water and then i went along acting as if everything was fine.. i didnt even say goodbye to a lot of em.. knowing how i WOULD cry, and who would want to see a school leader cry? so i got their emails... and then started packing my things... :(... I REALLY miss THEM!!!! but anywho, thats my short story on my only HIGHLIGHT for this summer!!!! i swear... im boring... (in the daylite!!! LOL) ... anywho, (again) they said that MAYBE we could have ANOTHER camp this year around the time for christmas vacation.. TYTE!!!!     anyways ill tag ya later...
