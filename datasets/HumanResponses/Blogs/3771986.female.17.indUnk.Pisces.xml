      There are things about my brother that I just can’t understand. For instance how is it he is the one with the job yet when it comes down to the “bare necessities “ I’m the one who pays for that xiet. Also how he can be comfortable about going on a two week trip with his ex-girlfriend and her family, all expenses paid. I’m sorry I can’t do that, its cool they are still friends and everything, but I still don’t think its rite. I just don’t know what to do with that boy. Better yet what he’s going to do when I graduate and go to boot camp. He wont have anyone to clean that death trap he considers a room. Ha, the fool cant even wash his own damn clothes. Every time I yell at him for it he uses the same damn excuse, ‘”I never ask you to do it you just do”. Damn rite I do, I shudder to think of what he might do if I don’t wash them for him.  And that bathroom, ::cringes:: I know I said I would never step foot in it until he cleaned it, which I haven’t done for a week.  But my gods that was disgusting I cant stand the thought of something in this house being so filthy. So I gave into my nature and cleaned. Can I help it if I’m like my mother and have to have things clean. Things for me don’t necessarily have to be organized. But at least clean. I know what people say. How can I go around saying I hate my brother yadda yadda yadda and then turn rite around and do this and that form him. Well, its not his bad habits that I hate him for, its other reasons. In reference to  his bad habits I’m merely disgusted to think that he can have such habits when my mother raised him better than that. Oh well. What can I do. Its not as though he listens to me anyways.

      I don't really think I can count the times I've wished I was  never  here. There are just so many things and so many people that frustrate me. I've been told "Well it always help to tell someone". I find that to be bull shit. If I told someone how I feel. How I really and truly felt, they'd just either stare at me and call me an idiot, or laugh at the situation cause compared to their  PETTY  fucking problems I don't matter. I'm just here to listen and at times give advice. Some people who know me think I should be locked up in one of those  "pretty lil white rooms" . If only they knew the things that run through my mind  everyday . The ways I could  physically  hurt myself. The times that I do. How many days I've  cried myself to sleep  because of things that have happened in my life. Things I don't understand, or just don't want to comprehend. There are days when I just feel like hiding in a dark corner and crying my eyes out. I know that there are a lot of people out there who feel the same way I do and can understand me. But then there are my friends and family who just plan out don't see my pain. I know I don't outwardly show it.  I can't , I don't want these people to straight up  turn their backs on me , cause I believe they would. So instead I just keep up my front, be either that sweet lil Chellie that takes care of the ones she loves or that bitchy lil Chelle who likes to argue with everyone.

      right now I just dont want to watch nething sad or sappy,.. well really I dontwant to watch nething that can make me cry. Something is seriously wrong with me. I dont know what it is. a hormone imbalance or sumthing?? Things that I normally wouldnt cry at, or things I've seen before but never cried about. Suddenly make me cry. And  when I say cry, I MEAN CRY! I'm sitting here watch The Last Samurai and this dude gets his head cut off. I would usually jus laugh at this but no my throats all dry I'm gasping for air cause I'm crying soo hard. And I'm cryin every singal time sum one dies. For those who have seen the movie know that a.. HELL of a lot of people die. But, the only thing that makes me feel my self while I'm watching the movie is the reason I cry'd when Katsumoto's son died...  ::sniff:: he was just too cute to die. I swear "I'm a complete dork". There Adrian... Chellie admits it.. BUT JUST THIS ONCE!!!
