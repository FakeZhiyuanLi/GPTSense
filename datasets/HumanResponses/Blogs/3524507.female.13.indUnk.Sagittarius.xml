      I wonder how I ever make it through a day How did I settle for the world in shades of gray When you go in circles all the scenery looks the same And you don't know why And I looked into your eyes Where the road stretched out in front of me And I realized  I'd never live Before your love I'd never felt Before your touch And I'd never needed anyone To make me feel alive But then again, I wasn't really livin'  I'd never lived... Before your love  I wanted more than just an ordinary life All of my dreams, seemed like castles in the sky I stand before you and my heart is in your hands And I dont know how I'd survive without your kiss Cuz you've given me A reason to exist  I'd never lived Before your love I'd never felt Before your touch I'd never needed anyone To make me feel alive But then again, I wasn't really livin'  I'd never lived... before your love I'd never lived... Before your love  And I don't know why Why the sun decides to shine But you've breathed your love into me just in time I'd never lived  Before your love I'd never felt Before your touch I'd never needed anyone To make me feel alive But then again I wasn't really livin'  I'd never lived I'd never lived Before!... Your!!... Love!!!...
