       Bridget was a sweetheart,  With Greek letters around her neck on a chain.  She wasn’t really my type, she was beautiful  And I'm kinda vain.  Her mind was closed like a liquor store on Sunday...  She was tryin’ to make her ex-boyfriend mad,  It’s kind of a rebound, but that’s okay...  She’s married with a kid on the way  And I'm glad I didn’t stand in the way  Of a good thing.  &nbsp;  Shelby was a stripper,  a damn good mechanic and a friend...  She used to pick me up in her ’64 and take me places,&nbsp;I’d never been.  She drank vodka on the rocks with a tall glass,  Chased with cocaine and her teenaged girlfriends.  I couldn’t phase her but that’s okay,  She’s livin’ with a girl named Renee.  Last I heard she was teachin in Frisco...  She’s got a good thing.  &nbsp;  Alice was a bartender,  at a place that I used to play for awhile.  Some of the girls didn’t like her...  she’d get twenty dollar tips with a smile.  I used to talk to her to try to get in her head,  But we’d just end up drunk in my bed....  I never knew her, that’s okay,  She’s in Vegas makin’ five bills a day.  She said I wasn’t too much fun when I was sober,  And now she’s got a good thing.  &nbsp;  So here’s to the lady......  whose name it hurts me to say,  She's the proverbial one...  that got away.  She said life is all a young girl has...  And I can’t find mine while&nbsp;livin’ yours...  I don’t blame her, but that’s okay  She’s married with a kid, and a kid on the way...  And I'm glad I didn’t get in the way....  Of a good thing.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  This has to be one of my favoritist songs...is favoritist a word?!&nbsp; Anyway, it was written by Matt Powell, but Bleu Edmondson does a cover of it.&nbsp; I think this was one of the first songs that I heard Bleu sing, that I fell in love with.&nbsp; I think to appreciate it you have to hear it, but even just reading it we can all somehow relate...there are always those one's you look back on and think...hmmm??!?!  &nbsp;   &nbsp;
