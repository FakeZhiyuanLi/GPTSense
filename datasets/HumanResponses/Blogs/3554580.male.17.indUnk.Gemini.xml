      Today, I was out chillin with some bros. It was "ill". I get back home and my mom is in the living room in the dark with nothing on. My dad is in the kitchen making some food.  "You missed the fight" My dad was drunk (off from like a 24 oz shit) my mom was really upset (no, not like crying or screaming or anything...but the opptosite...quite...looking sick) my brother had officially claimed to have moved out.  All while I was out?! Why leave poor Ryan out of the fun? So this whole day from 3 on I've been feeling really sick and tired. It sucks...

      People can really...suck. It's not even their fault. They don't TRY to. They just do it for whatever reason. You shouldn't just brush it off, but you would do well just to understand that that's how people are. We are born to suck, I guess. It's alright though. People need to be more alright with letting people be and stop beheading them. Band + rocking = should be coming soon. When it does, I don't know what we're going to do. Go insane? Hopefully.   How's the headache? I'm really hoping doing better. Mine is still coming on strong, again. Things sure go back and forth constantly. It's not really annoying, but it's an observation. I've made a few observations in the past few hours. They've been pretty nice. Well, not really. They're pretty bad...but it's cool to be able to notice them. Maybe they are problems that I would be willing to work on with my weak and or lazy hands. We'll just have to wait and see.

      So I'm looking at people's blogs...it almost seems if someone likes one cool thing...they like everything that is cool...this made me laugh to see    Damien Rice / "Aimee"  "How are you?" "I'm fine." "You sound tired." "I slept." "You still sound tired. Are you okay?" "I'm fine." "You sure dont sound like it." "I'm alright." "I'll talk to you later then."    that was someone's post...looking around more...that person is really pissed...they're vague too...thats cool

      for the past nine months, sundays haven't been awesome. it's always a reanactment of the same day. so here I write this. there's quite a long list of things that I have planned to do this evening, all of which haven't been started yet. I woke up late and earlier than I should have. I wasted my afternoon on a movie I'd already seen. I still can't get the hang of this blog thing. there's always so many things I have to say, and I refrain from all of it, resulting in some horribly dumb thing coming out that makes someone look at me with disgust. at the moment, everything is at a stand-still. soon that will be all over, but I can't decide whether I'm excited, scared, or oblivious of any of it. right now, I just want to get some things done successfully. funny how that starts out with a rant from me on my blog that I can't figure out how to use and that I don't know if anyone knows about.  it seems the never-ending cycle of my conflicting ideas combining and reducing me to nothing has unlimited supply of momentum with it. anyways, that's fine. I think I've done enough of this. That's one thing I can check off my list...back to waiting

      so, yea, I tried to avoid doing this and I failed I think blogs are pretty odd, but I'm bored of just puting my thoughts in a word document I just don't want to abuse it. summer vacation is coming up, and I'll have lots of time to do that. So that should be cool.

       Squeeze my eyes closed tightly  drifitng in and out of muffled thought-sounds  I can't eat  I can't sleep  I can't move from this spot  And this isn't the first I've felt like this    Today was nice. I went to Manteca Waterslides with my homedogg. It was rad, except for that everything went terribly wrong before we had even arrived. I couldn't tell if I was tired or hungry, but I kind of felt a little carsick. The whole ride I kept going back and forth. Feeling sicky, feeling fine. We finally show up in the parking lot and I feel like I'm going to puke. Dammit. So I went on slides for a half an hour, but I didn't feel better. I eventually hung out with talking to his mom by the pool for the rest of the day...and I got burnt the hell up!  I'm....red all over! And oh it stings.....gaaah.   In lame news, people are silly. I am correct in what I says.  So na na na na na na...(though, I  hate  being right)   In dumb awesome news, sneaky shady ridiculousness is the coolest invention ever.

      That loitering stuff didn't kill nearly enough time. While aimless walking through stores, I reallized a few more things(yes, another list):  NIKOS is back!!!! I could have easily been stealing stuff instead of just walking around. The funniest thing would be that what I need is exactly what I would never want. A hot mexican gangsta girl...oh, it would be soooo rad! I also reallized what my options are...they are the suckiest options in the world and therefore  extremely  amusing.  stickin it to the man

      There is pretty much nothing to do in this damn town. Right before I walk in the door to my house, my brother calls me and tells me I should leave.   Chris: What if I bring a girl over? Just take her to my room? Ryan: Yup!  Well, I still don't want to stay here. But there is nowhere to go. So this is lame, but whatever. I've got an escape plan. I can go loiter by myself in public. It will be excellent. Hell, I just need to kill some time. Though, as I think of that thoughts of a wasted summer hit hard. I've honestly done about everything prodcutive for the day that I can. This whole time thing has gotten retarded. Yesterday felt like it didn't even happen. That's partially a good thing. I was barely awake for any of it.  Nowadays, I wake up and within 2 hours I go play. After playing, we think about doing SOMETHING. It's around 5 or 7 and we're just "thinking"....We do nothing and I go home and hang out for some hours before going to sleep and repeating the exact same process. I guess what I've been reallizing is:  1. THERE ISN'T SHIT TO DO 2. I have one friend 3. This whole summer is becoming me trying to FEEL like I'm doing something productive  That pretty much wraps up every single problem going on.  Off to awesomely loiter. This is going to be ridiculous. I guess no one ever really hangs out on this side of town, sans...my neighbors...ugh

      Napoleon Dynamite was a really cool movie. It was really weird. I kept waiting for something to happen from the start to the end. I still didn't end disappointed either.  I'm back to being chilled out again. I seem to just think out everything..deconstruct...and put it all back together. I was making a problem for myself. A problem that I agreed with myself wasn't possible. People's advice sucks. They just tell me that I should do something ridiculous. I never want to do it. It just doesn't work at all like that. I need to stop worrying about trying to get a job. Summer is either wasted or not, depending on what I decide. I will decide not wasted, especially not chasing around some "job".   That leaves me just to work on the music thing. I'm getting different opinions on it. I'm not sure about them. I really really don't care anymore. I can willingly go into an insane show situation and just blast...because that's all that is left to do now. I'm not sure if the stuff came out good or not...even if it didn't really, it doesn't matter. I hope that people don't think it's THAT horrible. When I play it again now it just sounds better and better.    About feeling better. Stuff is pretty absurd. It always is though. I thought I decided that suckyness truly was really funny to notice. Something just needs to straighten me out. The only way to solve unsolvable problems is to make them not exist. Help seems to be on the way in the form of someone else's screams and it's nice. Thus, we chill.

      so...vague as vague as can be is the name of the game tonight.  so it's always just chill...even though it's not just when think things couldn't get more....yea....they do. I'm seriously...physically...entirely.."speechless" feeling kind of sickish...worried...horrible dumb bad what the fuck  theres other things to focus on as well....too bad they have to not show up leaving me hopeless to play around with what I got and like always, shit's never going to be bad just really uncomfortable the irony of it all is really disgusting "you're sorry. I'm sorry" - Mission Impossible 2 line ...hah  urlLink  this   *deep bre....fuck that...heh

      Ah yes. Well, only a few weeks left of this thing. That thing being my last summer vacation ever.... It's been alright. Really great at times recently. Being drunk seemed to really cheer me up the few times I was. Which is pretty weird, I'd assume. I can honestly say, after a night of being drunk, the next day, I felt energized. So, rockin commences daily. The shit is goin down, pretty much. I read something today that killed me. It was by a person I don't "know", but I know who they are. Yep, seems kind of creepy. Basically, he said exactly why I can't write an "About Me" section on my... other  "site". Theres just a few things that I feel like I would really want to say, but I am smart enough to reallize that I think it is wrong. It's like an attempt at not being superficial, in effect, still...is. Yes, that annoys me. In fact, it hurts me. I'm nearly positive I know what I want, but it's like they just said right out that in the end it won't even be worth it. That's a bum bummer. It really followed me thought process. Specifically, he said, "I could say I like.." blah blah blah, but it's not at all worth it. Honestly, um, fuck him. And honestly, I respect that alot. (he still ended up saying that he in fact  did  like said things)  So has this 3 months been a waste? On my count, I think not. I'm extremely worried about getting back into school. I'm afraid it's going to get in the way of what I've been trying so desperately to focus all of my energy on. Since I haven't come out with much products from all of this "focusing", I am not at all done with it! I want something real from it, something bigger than something almost far too uncertain to even feel anything from. Then again, once school starts, it could all explode... but I'm too worried about the whole situation of school. (what I'm able to take, how I'm being transported, if I'll be able to buy items needed for classes, if I will get enough credits for shize, if I will be able to overcome my procrastination habit acquired 6 years ago...fuckin sucks!)  So, I've been pretty much just trying to block out that in 3 weeks, it will all be in full swing.  Therefore, I will attempt to  get as much  out of this free time  that I can!!   Lastly, to be a dick (to no one  actually .  but I like to judge all of my actions as harshly as possible, then take it back immediately due to simultaneously reallizing how unfair it is)   I've managed to maintain the feeling I once promised myself I would never have. It keeps me going. Some kind of lack of hope and anger and motivation combination that swirls around in my chest evolving.  So shit yea, that's a pretty hefty post. And I don't even like this thing anymore. Proud.   "Rockin soon"...(no no, no more of that,  always  rockin)

      Yea, so I really don't like this blog thing anymore, but I'll just throw something out there. I am a madman!  Good news, I'm not at all dangerous. In fact, I could probably be considered to be very far from one. Yea, so I'm going to go do cool stuff now though, because I'm crazy like that. It's really cool. Alright. I try to be vague, but that's not that nice. In explanation, stuff is really really lame. I've managed to find yet another way to get around it though. That's just how stuff keeps ending up. It's good.  So, I'm going to go really now...
