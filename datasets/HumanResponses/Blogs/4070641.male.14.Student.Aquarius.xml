      I am sad. I have not been out all day. this is because Kevin is a gimp and cannot haul his lazy tratter lovin' arse out of bed. and since Devon is going away, i have no one else to meet up with. BOOO!! I did go into town yesterday, and Kevi, Devon and I started dreaming. we dreamt of year 11, and remembered that a bunch of noobie year 7's (now yr 8's) were forming bands. Hilarious. We also had an idea. In year 11, we plan to organize a battle of the bands. And we plan to kick arse. I am the best guitarist in the school y'know (or so people tell me). so please, feel free to get a band together and participate in 2 years time, so we may mock and destroy you puny mortals. I also spotted a PA system we plan to purchase, a cool ass telecaster, and an amp. All of which are expensive. Skintness sucks.  Now back to the real world. Spent the whole day playing SOCOM II. I have been playing 1 day and I am already in a clan. WOotage. I am the pwn.   Later folks. Jams

      Well. I've dones it. I have finally gotten  sooo  bored that I have created a blog. Woo and hurrah! * waves miniature paper flag*  You can just feel my excitement, can't you? Oh yes. What purpose does this blog serve? Well, (note to self: find new words to start sentences with) it really has no purpose other than to serve as a place for me to write about, well, me. Chances are that if you're reading this then you already know me (or so you think ¬_¬), so you'll probably know who all the "characters", as I like to call them, are. So that saves me the job of explaining. So, in brief, if you want to learn about what goes on in my life, and quite possibly what goes on in my manic hyperactive mind, then this is the place for you! And if you have stumbled in here by accident and are wondering who the hell this moron is, here's a little bit about myself;  Name: James Anthony Bolt (Jams to my friends[and&nbsp;pretty much&nbsp;everyone else])  D.O.B.: 29th January 1990  Height: 5'11"  Weight:9 stone  Shoe size: 10  Interests: Music, computers, videogames, Discworld, middle earth, music s'more, guitar, music, and oh yes, pies.  Likes: My jeans baggy, my hair long, my pies hot, and my guitar loud.  Dislikes: Fascism, racism, townies, chavs, pikies, trendies, gyppos, the government, noobs, obnoxious people, hypocrites, Joe Davidson.  Favourite bands: Muse, Radiohead, The Clash, The Flaming Lips, The Coral, Stereophonics, The Misfits, Jesse James, The Cure, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Led Zeppelin, REM, Steve Burns,The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Verve, Travis, Blur.   Well (argh! There it is again!), I think that should satisfy any lurking stalkers (yes Kevin, I'm talking to  you ). Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to play SOCOM II. Until the next update, tata. Now go home!   Jams

      Another day, another update. Hooray. Nothing interesting happened all week, until today. My Dad purchased 4 tickets to see Franz Ferdinand in October. W00t!! So that's My dad, me, Kevvie, and.... Tom. :(. hopefully he will be rebellious and not be able to go, so I can take Devon instead. I am thinking of producing a witty banner, or possibly throwing my b0x0rs onto the stage. It will be great. October 23rd, portsmouth Guidhall. Hurrah Hooray Bugrit Millenium hand and shrimp.  A very happy Jams (OMGF!1! Jams!? Happy?!?)

      This post was 456 words long. Blogger decided to publish only the title. Arses. So here is a delayed version of the post, in brief. Went to town with kevvie on tuesday, i think. Told him to meet me at 12. He never can. He was (shock!) asleep. Rung him. He said to meet at 1:30 instead. Never arrived. Had fallen asleep again. I went to his house instead, and he was in the shower. I waited in his bedroom, and he came in wearing only a pair of boxers. Wooo. Semi-nudity. He got dressed, and sprayed half a can of lynx deodorant on himself. I almost died. We left his house some time around 3, and headed into town. We walked for a few minutes, made it to Upham road, and a thunderstorm began. How fun. So we waited under a bus stop until the bus arrived, and went into town. And that was the highlight of last week.  By bye for now. Jams
