      What a long week. Even though this been a 4 day work week cuz of the long weekend, I feel completely exhausted. Last night was the CBC party, and it was probably the lamest industry party I have ever been to. The presentation was long and boring, the food sucked (it was only Sushi and I'm allergic to all Seafood), and they actually turned the lights up and told everyone to go home at 8:30!!!!! Anyways, we went to The Loose Moose afterwards, which was fun, and caught up with some friends. I couldn't really drink because I am on antibiotics and am scared something bad will happen. But then I was talking to this pharmacist dude later in the eveing who told me that in actuality, antibiotics and drinking have no problems together, which changed my world because I am ALWAYS on antibiotics for something or another...  Thinking about going to see that movie "The Day After Tomorrow" tonight, but have heard pretty bad reviews, so not sure I want to spend that much money to see a lame-ass movie.  Anyways, Yay! Friday! Couldn't come sooner....

      I work in advertising, and I really make myself sick. When I was in University, I used to attend so many sit-ins, marches, rallies....I even had bruises from being hit by rubber bullets at the WTO rally in Quebec. And now I work at a fucking advertising agency! I always thought I wanted to be a professor, and that when I finished school I would only work for a few years in this industry, gain some real life knowledge, and then go back to school so I could get a PHD and teach about its evils. But you know what, some part of me actually likes my job. Sometimes I hear myself on the phone, talking like a grown-up, negotiating, delegating, caring...and I can't actually believe its me. I feel like I am 2 people, the one who goes to work all dressed up and hard-ass, and the one who plays video games all night and loves to drink and smoke pot. I mean, I am really having a hard time with the fact that my job is to put advertisements on the air and spend other people's large sums of money, because these things are so poisonous to our souls in such huge quantities as we are exposed to today. And then I guess there's something to be said for the fact that we are an intelligent society and should be able to deconstruct these images and see them for what they are. But there are so damn MANY......  This is my third year in the business and I think its time for me to say goodbye. I just can't live with the garbage I do and the corporate politics.....  But then I think, am I too old to go back to school? I don't think I am, I'm only 24, but I FEEL alot older than that. I wonder if I got my PHD and became an associate professor if people would actually take me seriously?   The thought of it makes me laugh my ass off....

      I just really can't stand people sometimes. I am not trying to sound like a bitch, but I really think alot of people are supremely selfish and have a hard time actually listening. I have this supervisor at work who is as dumb as bricks, really, no joke.... I think sometmes when I speak to her what I say goes in one ear and out the other. And everyday she comes to my desk and asks me what she needs to be working on, and how I need to help her do something that she doesn't know how to do. And this is my supervisor! SO then I tell her, help her, whatever, and she doesn't even compute the information I gave her, just sits there staring at me like a deer caught in headlights....  She is my Omarosa...always creating more work by simply being there....  My boss does nothing about it either....I hate work politics.... it makes me want to scream! Does anyone out there work with a person this stupid? There must be.....I can't be alone in this madness of stupid people!

      I really had no idea what these things were until I read one this afternoon. Of course, here I am sitting at work worrying about my health, which is what I always do intead of working.....and I am looking up stuff on the internet about this particular health thing I am dealing with right now. And up pops this crazily entertaining "blog" about exactly the thing I was looking for! With such a personal spin.... I think I will like this blogging business....
