        Hello, everyone!     &nbsp;   I guess I'm officially hi-tech now...hi-speed internet, cable, blogspot...the whole shbang!     &nbsp;   To be quite honest, the major reason I wanted a blogspot was to house my collection of photos...of my bachelorette pad, my friends and the other parts of my oh-so exciting life in Mississauga. I really don't anticipate anyone to visit my page religiously to see what I've been up to (although that would be pretty darned flattering!!) - but if you're one of those who's really interested in knowing about my daily whereabouts, please feel free to let me know...and I'll either keep you posted so that you can live vicariously through me...or I'll be threatened and possibly call the cops on ya'! :)     &nbsp;   I'm really excited about this new spot on the www and I'm looking forward to posting all my photos up here soon....For now, I'm afraid that I'll have to get back to studying for my GMATs (my test date is frighteningly close!)     &nbsp;   To all, a great night!     Arlette &nbsp;

        Wow! What a stressful day!!      Woke up at around 10am (some girls and I had sort of a slumber party), had a wholesome breakfast, went shopping, chilled, went to work to give away some concert tickets and to deliver an interview, and then made my way to the Usher concert...If every day were like today, I think I'd need a membership to a local Spa!      That Usher, I tell you...he gave such an amazing show! The boy's got moves!!! He was so very entertaining to see...the way he and his fellow dancers move...whew! It was a non-stop, fun-filled event. I can confidently say that he was the very best performance I've seen in the time that I've moved here...This means, that he topped...Nickelback, Pearl Jam and those bands from a couple of decades ago who were at the Get Up N' Dance event (the one where we met Fran Drescher!). I guess that means that I really don't have much to compare Usher to...maybe I should catch s'more shows so that I can have a more educated opinion :)       I think I was the one enjoying myself the most tonight. It was great to know most of the songs, so I was able to sing along for a little while (sure, I may not know all of the lyrics, but who can really hear me?). He didn't invite me up to the stage, but he was wearing different caps throughout the night with the letter A on it. That's A for Arlette, of course. So that cap was Usher's discrete way of letting me know that he was dedicating the entire concert to me...how sweet! It's the little things that guys do for a lady that matter most, ya' know?   (heart fluttering) :)      All in all, not a bad way to start a workweek. Who ever said Mondays were no fun?? And w  hat will tomorrow bring at the office? Who knows...Adventure, excitement and non-stop action, I presume!   Never a dull day in Arletteville.

        Hi everyone,      Great news! I now have an online photo album. Feel free to check out   urlLink  my online photo album   . I'll let you know once the photos of my bachelorette pad are up (gotta' scan them first).      In other news...my friend Wasan is in town!! Wahoo! It's been such an eventful few days....We did a bunch of things, including:       Thursday:  Picnic at Confederation Park in Hamilton; Late Dinner/Snack at  urlLink Cafe Tu Tu Tango     Friday:  Shopping at IKEA and Heartland, Dinner at  urlLink Bombay Bhel     Saturday:   urlLink Taste of the Danforth Festival , BBQ, Partying on Richmond Street    Sunday:  Keeping it low-key so far...not sure what we'll do in the evening.      Tomorrow should be another exciting day in the life of Arlette, as I'll be going to the Usher concert, with Kanye West as the opening act. Yes, folks; even Mondays are fun on my side of the world.
