      two weeks later I finally write to you about nothing in particular, writing not because I want to but out of guilt and a bit of hope that someone somewhere will read me.

      After viewing various blogs, from both friends and relatives, I have come to the conclusion that a blog is a place to tell everybody what you want them to know about you without having to say it to their face.  It is where people expose their hearts and say, "This is who I am, take it or leave it."  It is a place where you can tell people how you really feel, and what you really think, without the danger of seeing the person across from you give you a look that could kill: kill the spirit, the soul, the imagination. After this realization, and after I repented for dangerous presuppositions, I have officially decided: IF YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM - JOIN THEM.  So here you may find a little more of me than you care to discover, but I suppose if you are really someone who loves me, this will delight you, suprise you, and fill you with a small portion of the adventure that thrives within my soul.  A little posey to start our journey:  Let us go together Let us wonder through the wilderness and wait for crows to feed us and springs to appear Let us catch colds and break bones and eat bugs and drink river water Let us laugh and cry and sing and dance Let us love and worship and adore and stand in awe of each other and our creator - o great spirit - o healing oil Let us amaze ourselves Let us give and give and give till our blood runs dry Let us go together  and wonder through the wilderness and wonder and wonder

      Ok so I made a blog, like how totally un-like me is that?  This is proof that summer makes you loose your brain and do weird things.  Very out-of-character things.  So yeah. Here it is.  How much you wanna bet I never get on this thing again?

      Mr. Dostoevsky said "For all the dentists in the world, you are still at the mercy of your own teeth." Maybe he meant that the world offers many "solutions" to many problems, but until you fix the inherent, you can prevent nothing. There is no such thing as an outside solution to an inside problem. There is no such thing as an inside solution to an outside problem. Perhaps this is why the Bible isn't connecting with the world. It is an inside document that is being applied to outside people. Last I checked, we were supposed to love those who chose a different inside than us. Is this too far? Is this limiting the limitless Words of an almighty, all-graceful, all-loving creator? Or is it being wise with the pearls that have been strung for us? What fine line do we cross to make surgical precision into amputation? Where and when does God want us to  stop  using the words that were so compassionately given to us? I have been cut deep, beyond human repair, by people wielding a battle sword and not a scalpel. Where does it end, and with whom?
