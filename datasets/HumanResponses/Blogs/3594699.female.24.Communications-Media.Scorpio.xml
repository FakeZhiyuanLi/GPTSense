      i had to pack my things up today to my new office upstairs. all the sudden i am the new office yuppie. today marks the end of my days in Operations. at least the 9-6 hour and 5 day work week is something to look forward to. other than that, nothing is quite a welocmed notion about me going up. never mind the fact that i dont really know what to do as the HR misplaced my Job description somewhere on her desk or something, however, i do know the most crucial part of the description, me handling the press organizations. that part i like.:)  received an email from Sue. well, she is having her problemas and what nots. i didnt offer any original resolutions. but i did encourage her to do something which she was thinking of doing. i hope she will do the right decision.  Fi came to accompany me for lunch today. i had Won Ton noodles and he was telling me about what went on yesterday and stuff. we wounded up in each other's arms in the office during my break. God knows how i felt. i would give anything to have that feeling and to come back to a big bear hug after work. i told him, one of the reason why i want to join the Airlines come next year is because i want to get away from the country. and to get away from him. i have a gut instinct i am gonna get hurt again, unintentionally, by him.  man, its hard to like someone but to get away as far as possible from him! i dont want him to be my ex, and yet we cant contain what we feel for each other. hows that for a pretty twisted situation?  he had to rush back, i guess i was keeping him back for a while. and he had to leave in a hurry and abruptly because he knows if he stand  there looking at me for one more second, he will end up staying for another half an hour!(Did i work at all today ya'll wonder? well, actually, a bit but 95% of it was spent doing nothing! :)).  i msgd him asking about tonight. he replied and he said he was involved in an accident and is unable to come. i called him almost immediately. he said he was okay but the car was a mess.   "My bumper fell off, alignment was off, front lights were totally screwed and plus i had to pay an extra 500 for a paint job" he said.  he apologized for not being able to come, and having to disappoint me again. i said okay. i understand the situation. i would cancel too if that is to happen to me.  well, my table is bare now, as opposed to the loadfuls of paperworks i used to have before this. i will miss this place. lots of memories in this office. both good and bad memories.   here's to a new chapter!

      the truth is, although i am a Public Relations Personnel, i don't have many friends. i mean, i counted everyone including the tealady in the office and i have only about MAYBE 30 friends. back then when i was 'the' wild child, i have lots of friends, some i had difficulty even remembering. most of them were in  their early 20's. we were hip, we were cool and we rule the joints in KL.   but really, when i was sitting in my office just now, trying to read something, i wondered where the hell are they now? are they still alive for one? people like Fazlee, the cute small guy who used to date Azah, the Exec from IJN, Nurul, the chick whom i got to see for the last time before she left for Queensland, Aussie. Zali, the dancer cum bartender whom i was introduced to in Planet Hollywood... last time i heard, he was a Gigolo to some big shot Datins. Kadok, Eddy, Sani KLCC, Sani Kembara, Hazlan Yahoo! Mimi, Ain, Syariffah, Remy Help inst.... man!!! where are these people??? not to forget Kopee, Basra, Safar and everyone else!!! whatever happen to them?   now, i am living a quiet life in JB with very few friends. Anna, Awi, Nisa. Sue is in the UK, new friends like Fi, Su, and everybody else. in KL, Boe, Chiran, Trey, Zura, Nasyrique, Izzurai, Kamal Baharin, Syed Anaz, Sean. these people have been with me through thick and thin. they are the bomb. never mind the fact that Trey and Sean is leaving to UK and Aussie respectively, Izzurai is going back to NZ for his studies and Nasy is on his way back to Boston.   **Sigh**  i found later, i dont really know how to make friends. i am too aloof for my own good. i discover that i have little need for them even though i know having friends is refreshing somewhat. i enjoy my time together and having close knitted friends like Fi who is always satisfying my craving for Chitake mushroom in my Yong Tou Foo and Anna who is my confidante in most career related problems. Awi who is my 'banker' sometimes. Su is the newest person who could posibbly be a friend. she is cute and adorable and everything. and plus a few people i got the fortune to know.  eyes open, chin up, smile and say Hi! thats what i am really trying hard to do!

      i am baacck! i missed a posting yesterday. was not feeling like posting one. i was supposed to attend a jewelry showcase sometime in the evening and it was also supposed to be sort of a plan showing effort on my part to a new prospect whom i would like to pull into doing the business. but she cancelled it the last minute so i decided to not go because i needed my sleep and everything.   i msgd Fi and told him that i'd not be going. and i called him up after that.   "I've just got back from kubur." he said. and i said okay. he was sounding solemn. and then i asked him again, whats wrong.   "I've just got back from a funeral Ayu." he said pleading me to understand. i asked who died.  "A friends' younger brother. he was your age."  i said sorry.  and he broke down. i might have sounded a bit too uncaring when i said "well, Fi, things happen. you should be happy that he is now with God or whatever." (I have always been bad in consoling people.)   he mumbled something like how the person has always been the joker in the family and now he's gone just like that.  as far as i am concerned, everytime any of my family members died, i did not cry for them. of course i did not laugh either. that would be wrong.i'd be sad, but i wont cry. thats just me. at the very least, he/she is now with God and he/she is spared from the cruelty of life itself. i repeated my condolences and then i told him "okay i would be coming for the showcase. he said my being there could at least make him feel better.  i doubt that though. and i dont even want to know why.  i think i need some jolt in the emotions department. i know i am aloof and almost to the point of frozen. i am oblivious to my own feelings and others. thats good for me i guess, but it cant b good to the others. :P..   afterall, i chose to be this way, and i'd rather be this way and would only change once i want to.

      hmm.. seems that everytime i am a changing my life, seems like my life would be more steadfastly stuck in the old frame of mind. but really, seriously, i have been too serious in thinking of all this stuff. my short term dream for now is to think peaceful thoughts... empty out our heads and just focus on making money.  my friend Zura once told me that i am still young and everything. i hafta make the first priority money based as possible. and i took her advise. and after that, i talked to andy, a friend who is my insurance agent as well about that possibility. he said yes.. i really think you could do it. you're out going and is darn good in inter-personal skills and all, and he does see the possibility to that. and so.. i am also an insurance agent.  zura was the one who pushed me to do a blog. well not exactly, i have been considering it for some time now. tooo many time on hand and too little things to do as for now.  going out for some Yong Tou Foo tonight with Fi. suddenly i have a craving for stuffed Chitake mushroom. :) lovely....  catch up with ya later!

      :)...   I am here because i am here... :)... anyway.. we all know where each of us comes from, no need to go detail on that.   i am Zarith and Ayu. who is Zarith and who is Ayu? Hahahaaa... we are a probable couple in 1. we are not related in any way more than what you guys would think we are. we are a rarer schizo case. we are like a friend to a friend. we keep each other sane and we keep each other happy! thats what's important.  this blog is dedicated to all my friends whos been there during my highs and lows.   we are 5ft5, about 58KG in weight and am happily living in my three times a week gym and occasional parties with close friends routine. have lots of acquaintances who knows me but none of them whom i could actually remember. KL is my second home and JB is where i unwillingly resides at for now.  i am walking without my feet and thinking without my mind and flying without my wings. words of wisdom from a friend.
