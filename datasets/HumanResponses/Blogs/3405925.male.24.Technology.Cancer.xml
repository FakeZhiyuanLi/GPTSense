       They ask her; "what type of music do you make?" "the good kind I hope" she answers.   I first encountered Gretchen Lieberum in the year 1999 or 2000, not sure; on  urlLink mp3.com  and was thrilled when I heard the cover of The bed's too big without you, originally released by The Police. It was nothing like the original, it was pleasant, yet touching; sad, yet made me smile, it was simply amazing. I have always been a fan of ladies singing jazz, acid jazz if possible, and this one lady gave me heaven for 5 minutes and 2 seconds.  I downloaded all of her songs on mp3.com; burned it to a disc (yes I am cheap :)) and that disc didnt leave my discman for at least three or four months, the album was named three a.m. which is the name of one of the songs on the album. The arrangements on the album are really naive, drums, bass, piano, sometimes the trumpet, rhodes piano but the flagship is the vocals, man she is good. The strongest songs in the album are The Bed's too big without you, green apple, jumped the gun and three a.m.; its a must have and I do recommend it strongly. You can check her gigs and her new album (which I havent listened to yet) from her  urlLink homepage

        urlLink Star Wars Galaxies  This game is one of the best games I have ever played, the catch is, it takes too much time to really enjoy the game, and all I can do is pay the subscription and download the updates once a month... god I hate working.. my girlfriend is going on vacation for a couple of months this summer, I hope to catch up in the meantime, who knows, I might be a jedi (I'm a smuggler right now) the game is a massively multi-player role playing game, people all around the world join in the star wars universe to make the most of it, there are other games like this, such as  urlLink everquest , or  urlLink ultima online  and in the near future, I think  urlLink world of warcraft   is going to be launched, and all three of these are role playing games in  tolkienish world, star wars galaxies, is entirely set in the star wars universe, complete with jedi, storm troopers, rebels and imperials, alongside with the regular folk (neutrals, artisans, mercenaries, bounty hunters etc.) check it out, if you have the time to play that is..

       Alexander Selkirk is the name; and this man is indeed the real Robinson Crusoe as Daniel Defoe has written in his book.  Born 1676 in Scotland, Selkirk was a shoemaker and at the age of 19, in 1695 he sailed out to sea after deciding that he had enough of the village life. Within 8 years, he was the captain of his own ship. He then joined the famous pirate William Dampier and in 1704 after getting involved in a quarrel with the captain, he wanted to be dropped off on the inhabited island of Juan Fernandez, which is 400 miles from the coast of Chile.  When stepped foot on the island he had a pound of gun powder, an axe, carpenter tools, clothes, a sleeping bag, the bible etc., while he was eating mussels and waiting for ships to come and rescue him and sleeping at the shore, he got scared of the sea lions and decided to explore the island, and he found drinking water, which was the key to his survival along with the wild goats and wild vegetables. His first major problem was the wild rats attacking during the night time, and he solved that problem by domesticating wild cats. He lit fires to signal ships passing by and the first ones to find him were the Spanish which were at war with England at that time. Selkirk had to flee to depth of the island twice to escape the Spanish soldiers who saw his signal and came to check it out. He was milking his tamed goats, gardening and raising crops, reading the bible loud not to lose his ability to speak; after a while he had ran out of gunpowder, his clothes and shoes were torn and battered but running after goats all the time had made him an expert hunter and walking on granite all the time had made his feet strong enough to walk barefoot all the time and the leather from his goats provided him the necessary materials that he needed to make basic clothing, isolation to keep his quarters warm and bedding. After about a year the island gave everything that Selkirk could possibly ask for. He was rescued in 1709 by a captain named Woodes Rogers whose ship belonged to a company which belonged to the same Dampier who had left him on that island 5 years ago. Despite his isolation he was given the title of lieutenant and then promoted to captain later. He returned to England in 1711, lived in Scotland for a while, got married, then returned back to sea and died from yellow fever at the age of 45 at sea, somewhere on the west coast of Africa.  The island of Juan Fernandez is known as the The Island of Robinson Crusoe, has a population of 700 and the locals are mainly occupied with lobster hunting, the island next to that was named Alexander Selkirk; both islands are territory of Chile, the town of Largo Scotland has a statue of Selkirk and his parents graves are still in the graveyard and are a tourist attraction.

       most musicians today use commercial instruments i.e. an instrument that was designed by a group of designers, developed by engineers, built by cheap laborers in the far east and sold by shark music stores to kids and people who are too lazy to investigate options and/or have plenty of money to spend.  it's ok for a person I think to own a commercial instrument of course, what difference does it make anyway if you're a weekend warrior with a day-job and a family and you practice in your bedroom/basement/garage etc. and play at the local pub every once in a while.  but for people who really want the genuine thing (and they can too be weekend warriors with a hungry ear for good sounding gear) having a guitar built could prove to be very rewarding (or building one themselves given that they have the talent, the courage and the time-resources-money etc.).  there are loads of custom guitar builders on the internet; a simple search of "custom guitar building" returns 155,000 results in google as of today. So we do indeed have enough resources.  What I am going to discuss here is how to make the most of the experience of building your own guitar. when I say building, I of course dont mean that you cut the tree, forge the hardware, wind the pickups and build it from scratch, there are loads of companies who supply the necessary parts. The first example I can give is  urlLink warmoth  which is a company based in washington-USA; they specialize in building superior guitar parts, and they carry most of the hardware such as bridges, frets, pickups etc.  If we were to make our own guitar, the first step would probably be to make a feasibility research. Lets say the project guitar is a fender stratocaster type guitar, with fancy features. First lets see how much it costs to go buy the guitar from a store which carries the features we would want; lets see, I would like a locking tremolo, nice machine heads, jumbo frets, a rosewood fingerboard, an ash body, preferably one piece (which would produce a thick, rich sound because it is one piece and does not have any glue holding any parts together) nice electronics ( a shielded pickguard, which will help reduce the 60hz hum that is likely to emerge) quality pickups (lets say a humbucker for the bridge and two single coils for the mid and neck positions) a nice finish, and of course expert craftmanship, hand built if possible.  If you were to order this guitar from fender themselves, they would probably redirect you to their custom shop; lets see one guitar that I found which was listed for $2479 but was being sold for $1735 at  urlLink music123.com ; the specs are: alder, 3 pieces glued together; Vintage Style 2-Point Synchronized Tremolo with Stamped Solid Steel Saddles and Milled Solid Steel Block; rosewood fingerboard, maple neck, Machine Heads: Nickel/Chrome, Sperzel Trim-LokÂ® Staggered Tuning Machines; 22 frets, a gold anodized aluminum pickguard, cobalt blue transparent finish, gloss on neck, hot noisless bridge pickup and vintage noiseless pickups on the neck and middle positions. You can see the guitar itself  urlLink here .  Now lets try to build the same quailty, if not better guitar by using only warmoth, which by the way is not one of the cheapest companies on the market, you can probably get a better deal on parts if you do some  urlLink research  here goes the parts and prices body: one piece swamp ash with a contoured heel (which lets you have a better grip of the higher frets on the neck) and a transparent blue gloss: $405 neck: maple with rosewood fingerboard, double expanding truss rod, fender strat headstock, clear gloss finishing: $192 bridge: Gotoh Wilkinson Tremolo; chrome; $89, includes everything necessary to mount it. tuning pegs :Schaller Mini Locking Tuners; chrome : $48 for the full set.  input jack: chrome strat plate, Planet Waves gold plated stereo jack with multiple contact points; $16 set of knobs (volume-tone-tone): standard strat, white; $6 humbucker mounting rig: chrome: $7.50 plate (for the joint where the neck joins the body): chrome $4.50 pots: 1 500k for volume, one 250k for the mid-neck tone and one push and pull for the bridge which lets us do coil splitting, totals up to: $17 screws of all kinds: pickup, pickguard, bridge, tremolo etc: $10, all chrome. schaller locking strap holders: $12 chrome LSR roller nut (which has little iron balls which let the string slide when bended) $40 chrome. set of string retainers with the chrome bar; $10 5 way switch for the pickups: $12 copper shielding tape; about $5 for the whole pickguard wiring: $5.95 standard white pickuard, drilled for our choice of pickups, bridge and switches-knobs $20 Now this all totals up to $905 ; plus I will add another $100 just in case; what does that total? $1005; lets buy a case for the guitar for another $100; thats $1100 to round up.  Now the last thing we need to add is the pickups; you can buy good pickups from companies like seymour duncan for about $50-$60 each; or buy custom wound, boutique ones which could be more expensive or cheaper than widely commercial pickups from manufacturers like  urlLink lindy fralin ,  urlLink bill lawrence  etc. lets say we buy a set of seymour duncan, an alnico 2 humbucker for the bridge and two single coil vintage's for the neck and mid positions (and a reminder, these arent the best set you can buy for the price, you can get a full set from bill lawrence for about $130-but it will take about a month and a half for them to reach you) and that totals to something like $200 and the final subtotal would be $1300; now we have all the parts and we need to get them assembled; now you can do this yourself, if you have the patience and/or experience etc; but what I would suggest is to get help from a luthier, or a guitar technician, i.e. someone who has done work similar to this. Lets assume we pay the luthier a good $200 for an afternoons work (since there is no finishind, glueing etc. its only putting the parts together and turning some screws) and that totals up to $1500 doesnt it, now thats still about $300 cheaper than the custom shop fender, plus it is way way better in terms of build material, sound and personality; first of all I would name my guitar emrahcaster (lame yes, but its my guitar, I can name it anything I like can't I?) the drawbacks of building your own guitar could be the time being involved, the research you have to do, labor, waiting for parts to be produced which can take up to a couple of months in some cases, and the possibility that you don't like the end product (which would basicly be the fault of the wrong selection of parts and/or builders, not yours entirely) but in my opinion it definitely is worth taking the risk and imagine that the outcome is a beauty, I guess I would be as proud as I could be.
