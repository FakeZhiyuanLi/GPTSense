						   IN THE SPACESHIP, THE SILVER SPACESHIP�  I found out recently that Showtime is remaking my all-time favourite movie,   The Lion in Winter   (I find it wildly fun that this and my second-favourite movie,   The Princess Bride  , were written by brothers, James and William Goldman). I had a lightning series of reactions to this news: first wariness, then excitement, and then a profound irritation.  Let me explain.  Remaking any great film is a slippery business, and although I have a bias towards it, I can imagine objectively that stepping into the medieval slippers of Katharine Hepburn and Peter O�Toole would be, to make a possibly irresponsible understatement, terrifying. The story is rightly dominated by the kaleidoscopic dynamic of Henry and Eleanor�s relationship, and it�s going to take more than a bushel of genius to make any retelling worthwhile.  And why Showtime, of all things?   A Man For All Seasons   was remade for television, and I�m sure that was fine, but   Lion   was a medieval epic, a family squabble on a grand scale, with a   rococo   sideshow of nations and nipples and wonderfully anachronistic Christmas trees. If you�re going to remake a film like this, for God�s sake do it properly, with serious cash and serious backbone.  Moving on to excitement, I�ve remade this film a thousand times in my mind. Patrick Stewart and Glenn Close as Henry and Eleanor are stout choices, and such casting made me forget the words �TV movie� for a little while (I noted with simultaneous annoyance and amusement that a legion of Star Trek fans have now taken an interest in the film, and feel it necessary to replace Glenn with Kate Mulgrew � two great captains together at last, I suppose). Besides which remaking the film would provide me an alternative to reading the play over and over to get my Lion fix. Will they use the same screenplay as the original film, or cull from the play to find the interesting omitted tidbits? Will they dumb down the language, as filmmakers so often feel the need to do these days? What about the original score? The settings? The costumes?  And so I passed into my irritation phase, which is where you�ll find me today. Supposedly the film is supposed to begin production next January, but there�s virtually nothing to be found about it. Stewart doubles up as one of the executive producers, Andrei Konchalovsky is slated to direct (I looked him up and shuddered the moment I saw the credit for Tango & Cash, but a reliable friend assures me that he�s up to the task), and filming is taking place in Hungary, but beyond that, nothing. No release date, no word on the script, and apparently only the two leads have so far been cast. The information gap is too wide for me to process.  By the by, the same people who elected Mulgrew as the next Katharine Hepburn also made such choices as Matt Damon for Richard the Lionheart and Leonardo DiCaprio for John Lackland, which were, I have to say, too horrifying to get even a giggle out of me.  As soon as my knee jerks I�ll offer up some casting choices of my own. Hopefully there will be an update soon. For the time being, I suppose there�s nothing for it but to keep watching the skies.

						   Should I conduct an interview with myself by way of introduction? I could, but I'm not nearly that clever.   I am twenty-four years old. I have a degree in History, specializing in early modern England. Reluctantly I drag behind me a minor in English, much like a can of beer tied with a very long rope to a car that has "JUST MARRED" scrawled across the back. I'm sure that the spectacular uselessness of literary theory will be the always-already subject of all manner of run-on sentence here in the future.  I am largely flummoxed by current events: I have opinions about Israel and smoking bylaws and, occasionally, Australian referenda, but generally I find anything that happened after 1714 difficult to process. I've received a surfeit of grief over my politique-critique blind spot, but I'm more than contented to occupy myself between Eleanor of Aquitaine's adventure on Crusade and the Golden Speech of 1601, so there will be no tears for me.  Here, I will be scrawling thoughts about girls and boys and history and film - and perhaps just a rant or two about Differance and sign-signifier-signified and the rest of the smarmy A/V Club lexicon of that impenetrable thought-wankery. Finally, I'm left-handed.  And a monarchist.

						    AMENDMENT   Yes, I see that Rebecca Ramos is "part lawyer, part businesswoman," whatever that means. I'm picturing a law school next to Dr. Nick's Hollywood Upstairs Medical College.

						    MATH IS HARD   Colby's  mention  of January Playmate  Rebecca Ramos  (beware of nipple) is rightly critical, but to my mind, not critical enough. Listen to this:   It's a culturally diverse country, so it makes sense to feature different women. You don't have to be a skinny supermodel in your early 20s to be a Playmate .  OK, Rebecca. I'll take you up on that statement and look at  your  stats:  Height: 5'5" Weight: 110 Bust: 34DD Waist: 24 Hips: 34  Apart from a charming height deficiency, what do you see there? I see measurements that, at the age of 24, I will never see again, if indeed I ever had them.  And as for being 35, well. What's Rebecca's ambition? "To pursue a meaningful personal and professional path with passion." A path in what? Alliteration? I can understand that each of us comes to God (or a job) in his or her own way, and that there are many whose careers haven't reached their height or even realized meaningful form yet at the age of 35, but by that age, most people know  what they want to be when they grow up .  I don't mind  Playboy  that much; I really don't. But, and God help me for saying this, the more explicit magazines are generally  far  more tolerant of the diversity of female beauty - which isn't to say that they're necessarily tolerant, but certainly more so. I can accept a lot of things, but not that  Playboy  doesn't have "preconceptions" about women and beauty. Don't quit your day job, Hef.

						    FILM AND THEATRE REVIEW   So my gift to myself, upon completing my studies, was to go see  The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers . Actually, it was a gift from my boyfriend, because he paid my share of the $27.00 it takes to get two people into a theatre these days, and I've forgotten to pay him back.  Mike and I went to see the first Lord of the Rings movie last year, motivated by little more than the ability to be conversant about it at social gatherings. I was completely sucked in by it; he wasn't, so much. But I daresay it was easier for me: I love  Ian Holm  and  Cate Blanchett , and I have the same lovely soft spot for  Ian McKellen  that I do for  Charlie Watts  (it's easy to see why!).  I enjoyed  The Two Towers  less, but I'm not eager to blame that on the film itself. Every time there was a close-up shot of  Orlando Bloom  looking serious (often), or gallant riders on gallant horses galloping in the green distance (often), Mike would lean over to me and whisper "poncy", but I'm sure there was a good story to be told, and that  Peter Jackson  told it well. Look back up at the $27.00 figure I mentioned earlier, and then meditate on this: I went to the famous Silver City Theatre in  West Edmonton Mall  and paid (well, Mike paid)  twenty-seven dollars , and by the time this movie was over, I could barely move my neck, it was in so much pain. Let me explain.  This was the first Friday that  The Two Towers  was onscreen, so naturally the theatres were packed. Mike and I decided to go to one of two shows playing at 11:30 pm and, having bought the tickets in advance, showed up fifteen minutes early. Now, any of you who have been to one of these massive-screen theatres will know how it's laid out: the seats ascend towards the back, and the first quarter of them are ridiculously close to the screen. The patron is not looking remotely straight ahead to see the film, but rather  up , particularly if the patron in question (me) is only five feet tall. Of course we had to sit in that quarter, because the theatre was packed, and no one likes those seats.  I would much rather take my $27.00 to South Edmonton Common, a newer theatre that has almost exactly the same layout as Silver City, but its seats recline slightly, so you can position your neck however it's comfortable, and that full quarter of their seats doesn't go wasted by people who are extremely reluctant to sit there. So three cheers for  Cineplex Odeon .  I'm determined to see  The Two Towers  again, and equally determined not to pay Silver City to do it. Ponces.

						    LETTER TO THE EDITOR   My mom tells me that what happened to my tongue wasn't a "severance", but a laceration. This will be the last word.

						    CORRECTION   Regarding the severance of my tongue... I must say that because I was just a babe, I have no memory of injuring my tongue, just family testimony and a series of infinitesimal bumps going across the middle of it, which could just as easily be taste buds. I wasn't even thinking when I told you how it happened, but luckily my mom corrected me, and we're able to set the record straight. I wasn't sitting on a stool, I was sitting on a chair at the kitchen table, and the accident occurred when I tried to crawl up.  I know why I thought it was a stool, though. Of course I have no idea what our home looked like then, except by the clues of photographs, so at some point I assembled it in my head until I had a concrete image of the scene in my mind, and naturally it was entirely fraudulent - but I didn't realize that while I was writing. For some reason I had placed us in the apartment of an old family friend, a place we frequently visited when I was in elementary school. It was  there  that I used to sit on the stools by the kitchen counter, with my mom, when I was quite big enough to get onto them myself.  When my mom mentioned this, my first instinct was to edit the post rather than posting a correction, but I'm glad that I've had the chance to sort out these assumptions in my head. It's always a strange thing when you remember events in your childhood in a skewed or false way, but of course this isn't something I remember: this is a story I've been told, that at some point past memory I transposed onto a familiar setting, changing the course of things in my mind. This is good news: even if I can't remember it, I can at least be reminded of what really happened.

						    YES, I KNOW...   It's been a few days, and I'm sorry. I'd been spending so much time at the computer that I came to hate the sight of it for a while there.  Besides which I've been reading! Yesterday I finished reading  Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West  by world-traveling author  Gregory Maguire , and...  well . What a completely wonderful book. I don't suppose that before this book was written, anyone thought about how hard it would be to grow up with green skin, or about the crippling taxes the Oz Regent raised in the construction of the Yellow Brick Road.  He calls the Witch Elphaba, a name taken from the initials of L. Frank Baum, and follows her life from birth to death. Familiar characters pop up throughout: Maguire's Glinda, for example, is a sort of latter-day sorority snob, unwillingly roomed with Elphaba during their college years. Elphaba herself, predictably, is never truly evil or wicked, but neither does she have immediately likeable qualities - ultimately she is frank, loyal and steadfast (not to mention a genius), but next to Glinda's glamorous debutante, Elphaba is a reclusive academic, driven on one hand by her passion for the natural sciences (she breeds the flying monkeys herself), and on the other by a pathological (but well-grounded) fear of water.   What I found most interesting about this book is that in making Elphaba the hero, Maguire didn't find it necessary to vilify Dorothy, either by giving her evil intentions or by simply turning her into a brat. In fact, Dorothy's... I don't know -  cameo  seems to be the best word - is almost disappointing because it indicates nothing about her character beyond that which was formed by Baum's original story.  Maguire  says  that the germ of the book was a curiosity about the nature of evil, rather than a specific desire to exonerate the Wicked Witch of the West, but the reader doesn't really learn much about evil other than the age-old axiom - admittedly often ignored - that things aren't always what they seem.  I read  Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister , Maguire's other attempt to turn a classic story on its head, a few months ago. It's equally good, if not better, and I would recommend it to anyone. But I found  Wicked  to be somewhat more engaging, probably because the Wicked Witch of the West is, on her face (as it were), a more exciting and likely heroine. Maguire opens  Wicked  with this quotation from  War and Peace :   In historical events great men - so called - are but the labels that serve to give a name to an event, and like labels, they have the last possible connection with the event itself. Every action of theirs, that seems to them an act of their own free will, is in an historical sense not free at all, but in bondage to the whole course of previous history, and predestined from all eternity .  And that's all I have to say for the moment. My keeping regular hours has been somewhat bad for this weblog, because I tended before to write my entries in a fog of sleeplessness, and I haven't experienced the coupling of wanting to sleep with not being able to for several days now. But don't worry: I'll always be back.

						    TO SIR WITH LOVE   I was going to write "I'm angry at the feminists again," but then I realized that I don't want to vilify feminism in its entirety as a movement or a culture, far from it. Right now it's just the ones who dabble in gender theory on an academic level who are annoying me.  Do you believe - and really, I want answers on this - that performing fellatio is an act of total submission? That someone (for the sake of this writing, a woman) is giving up herself to perform this act? Because reading "Postmodern Misogyny in  Blue Velvet ," I learned from Jane M. Shattuc (sorry - I can't find any useful links) that to fellate someone is to surrender all control and personal identity.   On a practical level: sure, ostensibly the woman is expending time and energy to provide pleasure for a man (the theory omits any pleasure the woman herself might derive from the act), but think for five seconds and you'll realize how vulnerable  he  is made by this event: a man would either have to trust a woman completely or be  quite  stupid to put himself in such a position. Not to mention that fellatio is far less potentially perilous for women than intercourse: this is perhaps the most effective occasion for a woman to use her teeth in the event of any danger.  I find it mystifying that the same group of people who are shouting that women deserve orgasms too (a stance I naturally agree with) would seemingly take that to the extreme of denying men sexual pleasure entirely. Who is served by only one person were having a good time? I know, I know, I  know  that for centuries it was considered sane and appropriate that women not enjoy sex or have orgasms, but does the pendulum have to swing all the way? I mean, why denounce fellatio while simultaneously demanding the reciprocal act?  This seems to be the kind of proverbial hairball coughed up from the feminism of the 1970s (even though Shattuc's piece was written in 1992), which isn't to suggest that those ideas weren't valuable, but that matters have evolved: the work isn't finished, certainly, but women shouldn't have to segregate themselves entirely from men in order to have identities, or want to make them suffer, any longer. In  Kiss My Tiara: How to Rule the World As A Smartmouth Goddess , Susan Jane Gilman writes:   I'm not knocking the women's movement of the past years. I'm a huge advocate and beneficiary of choice, workplace-protection laws, and domestic violence legislation. But I also realize that feminism seventies-style is just about the only trend from the disco era that young women today have not rushed to resurrect. Rhetoric about "reconfiguring the phallocentric modalities of the patriarchy," just turns us into zombies.    Like Gilman, I don't know how to approach this subject without being perceived as ungrateful for the work that feminism has done. I am consistently aware of my vote, my work, and the fact that I have personally elected to not learn how to cook (...many things, anyway). In my circle of friends, my boyfriend is known as an "honorary girl," which is the highest of high praise from both sides of the fence: women perceive that he understands them, and men are jealous of him because he understands them.   So I ask you: now that he's an honorary girl, can I make an informed decision to engage in whatever sexual acts I please with him without somehow losing my empowerment?

						    IN OUR IMAGE     Timothy Findley 's description of God:   "Apparently the carriage had been closed for many hours and Yaweh, perhaps, had been sleeping - even dreaming. Certainly, He seemed to be confused.The footmen waited patiently to help him down.   "Yaweh drew a small tin box from somewhere in His robe and opened it. His fingers were not as long as Emma thought they might have been, though part of the reason for this was plainly arthritis. The knuckles were huge and the fingers curled in unnatural shapes. Something was lifted from the box - placed against His lips and drawn into His mouth.  God sucks lozenges!  thought Emma, astonished.  Just like Doctor Noyes!    "The box was replaced in its pocket and Yaweh put out first one and then the other of His broken, twisted hands towards the footmen. His robe could now be seen by the light of day and it was black with dark blue facings and, deep inside, where its linings could be seen in the sleeves, it was red. His beard flowed all the way to His waist and though it was white, there were yellow streaks and bits of food and knotted tats. His eyes were narrowed against the light and their rims were pink and watery - sore looking, and tender. His lips could not be seen, though where they were was marked by sweeping moustaches growing along the upper lip. His nose was like a bone and strongly hooked and it set Yaweh's eyes very wide apart beneath a broad, high brow that, together with His nose and the general shape of his head, made Him almost unbearably beautiful."   From  Not Wanted on the Voyage .   More soon.

						    POSH POSH COLBY COSH   Thank you  Colby  for mentioning me, or rather  a part of me  in your weblog.  I got a lot of teasing in elementary school when my peers found out that I'd sliced off my tongue. For the record: yes, one can have stitches in one's tongue. Here's the story:  When I was two years old, I was standing on a bar stool next to the counter in my family kitchen. I lost my footing and fell, and my chin smashed against the counter. My tongue, of course, was caught between my teeth and sliced off. There was a lot of blood. Thank God for doctors!  It's now back on, in perfect health, and indeed, I've gotten comments on its length: I can touch my nose and the bottom of my chin with it. But sorry, guys: I already have a boyfriend.

						    SINGLE WHITE WEST WINGNUT   For the first time in a few months, I picked up  Entertainment Weekly  this morning - it figures, since I was supposed to be reading about India's economic development. But that's by the wayside.  Sadly, the magazine tells me that the incomporable  Elvis Costello  has split from his lovely wife  Cait O'Riorden , former bassist for the  Pogues . I think I might have actually felt unnaturally sad at this news, and why? I've been an Elvis fan for years, but this doesn't mean he's retiring. I suppose I just feel a little pull whenever anything bad happens to someone who's been affiliated with a band once known as the Nipple Erectors.  I see also that  The West Wing  is listed among "What Blew" in EW's  ratings review for NBC . Trying to explain the ratings slip among 18-49ers, NBC Entertainment president Jeff Zucker said, "Clearly the young women were taken away by 'The Bachelor'."   Ugh.  You know, I saw that show once.  My God  is all I have to say. I watch The West Wing, and if there really is a contingent of female viewers who watch  both  shows, they must watch WW solely to drool over the forgettable  Rob Lowe  - with the sound off. Anyway, no harm, no foul, because Lowe will soon be replaced by  Joshua Malina , the kind of man I really drool over.

						    IT LIKES ME!   Oh, sweet triumph. I've managed to add links.   A couple of explanations: first, most of these pages are the ones I visit most often, and by-and-large they're entertainment-based rather than news or respectable-smart-person-based. Second, a link to a New Mexico newspaper might seem a bit esoteric for an Edmonton weblog, but Michael Kelly, my beloved father, is its Assistant City Editor, so I frequent it rather, well, frequently. You should too! Finally, yes, there is more coming.  Thanks to  Colby  for his patient tutorials.

						    DEAR BLOG, HOPE YOU GOT THE LETTER AND...  PART TWO   (Blogger seems to choke quite remarkably on long posts, so here's the rest...)  Yes, my friend Andy has gotten me through tough times. His  stage fright  only made me love him more. And I remember distinctly spiralling into an impotent rage of one variety or another when I was nineteen years old, putting �Dear God� on my Discman and running into my parents� back yard to jump wildly on their trampoline for those four-odd minutes. I felt infinitely better afterwards: I should submit the exercise to a psychology textbook.  He also handed me one of my loveliest inspirations, however insubstantial it may have been, in the form of the song �Wrapped in Grey�. Liltingly, he explains that �your heart is the big box of paints�� Well, for some criminal period of time, I thought he was saying �Your heart is the beat-box of pain.� When I finally picked up the liner notes and saw that I was wrong, I was momentarily filled with disappointment. In a flash, however, I realized that because he hadn�t said it, the line was my own, and swiftly wrote a rather terrible blank-verse poem surrounding it. This is why pencils have erasers, but still.  For your edification and mine,  here  is an interesting article. Despite  Colby Cosh 's charge that  The Onion  has  gone stale , it's still good for the occasional laff.

						    DEAR BLOG, HOPE YOU GOT THE LETTER AND�   PART ONE   When did I first become an  XTC  fan? I think it must have been in high school, roundabout the first time I got stoned (no, the pot did not enhance the experience; it simply turned me into a blithering idiot). Someone had made my boyfriend a mixed tape, and two of the songs of note were  Dread Zeppelin �s version of �Stairway to Heaven,� and XTC�s �Living Through Another Cuba�. In retrospect I realize that this is a quintessential XTC creation, and was a perfect introduction for me.  I moved on from there. In a spirit of honesty I have to admit that I heard Sarah McLachlan�s cover of �Dear God� and the Crash Test Dummies� �The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead� before I heard the originals, but those were mistakes soon rectified.  Some of my most wonderful experiences were had owing to the genius of Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding, not to mention the oft-overlooked Dave Gregory (see  Chalkhills  for details). I made one of my best friends by quoting   Nigel isn�t outspoken But he likes to speak And he loves to be spoken to!   and substituting Nigel�s name for hers. Later, she became my first roommate, in a rundown house for too much rent, and we bounced from wall to wall with Cedar Blush paint while �Senses Working Overtime� bombilated on repeat. My stars, those were the days, when I saw no impropriety at all in strutting around with nothing but cutoffs and a demi-cup bra to hide my shame. This is one life for which one cannot say �Ah, but I was so much older then; I�m younger than that now.� My creaking twenty-four-year-old bones tell me different.

						    AT A LOSS, PART ONE   I know that it's been two days, and in order to be responsible or semi-responsible I have to post, but for the first time, I don't have anything in particular to say.  I think the lapse is due to the fact that I'm not doing anything: I'm going through a short break in my studies, so the last few days have been spent more or less in my pajamas. In about twenty-four hours it's going to pick up again, making me MISERABLE (this term has been the furthest possible point from "fun").   I've been having a good time since my last assignment wrapped (read all about it below!). I've been watching a lot of  All in the Family   - what a great show. It immersed me so much that I've actually cried a couple of times - pathetic, I know - and laughed out loud, which is something I don't usually bother with when I'm alone.(do you find that? That cues that would make you laugh in company just make your mind register "That's funny", eliminating the need to laugh when you're alone?). I often find myself double-taking at  Rob Reiner , who is one of those people who just looks better fat - he's quite hideous on this show.  Curiously I found myself feeling a sort of back-handed affection for Archie, sometimes wishing that Meathead would just bloody leave him alone. This is probably because he reminded me some of my own maternal grandfather, God rest his soul. He lived in the family home in Kentucky, sitting eternally on his porch swing, and he had to holler everything because he positioned himself right in front of the air conditioner, and between that and the bug zapper hanging from the porch awning, no one could hear him. Poor guy: my mother married a Jewish man and moved to Canada, two very suspicious moves (like Archie, he associated Canada with draft-dodging).   He died, far away from me, when I was eighteen, so I never got to know him very well, but he was always very sweet to me, asking me to sit on his knee and giving me lots of hugs. It was owing to his generosity that I had my first and only run-in with Lucky Charms, for which I'm always grateful. I have no reason to judge him, and truthfully, in many ways I enjoyed him from the same distance that I now enjoy Archie Bunker.  It's just too bad that my grandfather never got his own show!

						    FAME AT LAST   I'd like to thank  Kevin Michael Grace  for giving me a  mention  on his site. I had to take a mighty pull on my cigarette before I read it, because I saw my name in big red letters right underneath the headline "Future Pathetic," but it ended up being very sweet, actually.  Now for Elizabeth and Mary.  A few years ago I concluded that most people believe that one cannot admire both Elizabeth and Mary, and I don't really see why. Certainly, they were enemies for what was a very high-profile (but relatively short) period in both of their lives, and their reigns were entirely different. However, as unlikely as it may seem, I have almost unlimited respect for them both.  One only has to take the briefest scan across Mary's life in its entirety to see that forces beyond her control doomed her almost from the beginning. She was the daughter of a woman who made herself the enemy of the Court; her stunted growth made it impossible for her to be strategically married off when she was still young. However, she had much of the cleverness of  Catherine of Aragon , as well as the charisma of her father  Henry VIII . One can see that immediately by the way she repossessed her throne from  Jane Grey  and  Northumberland's  forces, and later, as Queen, crushed the  Wyatt rebellion  that threatened her rule. She was gifted at inspiring loyalty, this much is clear.  But as Julian Martin, one of Canada's foremost Tudor historians, puts forth, Mary was the foundational catalyst for the English forever associating Catholicism with foreign rule. The combination of having made an unpopular Spanish marriage with attempting to reimpose Catholicism by force in England ( Philip II , for the record, considered Mary's methods quite foolhardy) was fatal to her reputation as a monarch. A decent woman, Mary would have made a far better abbess than a Queen.  Elizabeth, on the other hand, was a master at iconography, and held the love of her people for much of her reign. She has been called a philistine who detested change, and there certainly is some truth in that, but her gift was not for creating, but for publicizing. A man in Norwich mockingly called her the "Virgin Queen" in 1578, and she took the epithet and wore it like a badge. Certainly, some of her acts as Queen were questionable, but one must admire a woman in the sixteenth century, named illegitimate from birth, who managed not only to escape death and insignificance, but also to rule a kingdom for nearly half a century and provide it with one of its first senses of true patriotism. Consider what  Pope Sixtus V , whose predecessor had excommunicated her, said of her:   She is certainly a great Queen and were she only a Catholic she would be our dearly beloved.  Just look how well she governs!  She is only a woman, only mistress of half an island, and yet she makes herself feared by Spain, by France, by the Empire, by all....  Our children would have ruled the whole world .  And OF COURSE I saw the Futurama episode about the lost city of Atlanta, Kevin! That was a great episode! Did you really think I could be that clever on my own?

						    THE NEVERENDING STORY   I've got "This is the Song That Never Ends" stuck in my head, and it's been there for about two days now. This could be because I watch too much television.   It's that Motrin ad. Do you know it? A mother on a freeway (in what seems to be a sensible Volvo) with her children, who are singing "This is the Song That Never Ends" in the back seat. She looks back and realizes that they've gotten into a bag of chocolate-covered espresso beans, or coffee beans or what-have-you. I forget what the tagline is, but it's something like "Life Demands Lysol".  A couple of years ago I saw a documentary on advertising in the 1960s, and the ad that got me the most was this one: a woman in an apron, holding a vacuum, and flying through the air with an euphoric smile on her face, with the words "MILTOWN: IT MAKES THE HOUSEWORK JUST FLY BY". And it occurs to me today: some things never change.  I mean, what is this Motrin ad really suggesting? A good friend once suggested to me, probably rightly, that headaches are caused principally by dehydration, so what I see is a company telling mothers that they need to IMPAIR themselves to get through their days. I mean, the woman was  driving , for Christ's sake.  Now, I know that this kind of talk is unpopular, but I've got a significant beef with the way women are used in advertising in what's supposed to be an enlightened age. The only time I've ever seen a man in an advertisement for a cleaning product is the one for Swiffer, whose pitch is that "it's so easy, even HE'LL do it now", and the Lean Cuisine and Hamburger Helper ads for dinners that put themselves in frying pans, cook themselves, put themselves on plates, and then clean up afterwards.   The obvious rejoinder to this is that the ads are mocking men, that they're too stupid to do housework, but I don't buy it. After a long day at the office, what  should  we expect men to do?  That's all I'll say for now. I'm going to go back to listening to "Sweetness" by  Jimmy Eat World  to get "This is the Song That Never Ends" out of my head.

						    SIMPSORAMA   I see that  Kevin Michael Grace  has recently completed a weblog entry on  Futurama and The Simpsons , and he more or less mirrors my opinion (stated below): he writes, "When did it finally jump the shark? Could it have been when they killed Maude Flanders for laughs and then had Ned dating again in the  same episode ."  Truthfully, though, and maybe it's because I'm weak, I still cringe when I think of  the Simpsons  being taken off the air, even in the face of  Futurama  having been cancelled. I'll agree that new episodes aren't often anything to get excited about anymore, but... but...  He writes, "That show has been an embarrassment for years: poorly written, grossly sentimental, a showcase for witless guest stars unaware that its cachet was long ago forfeited." The problem with the Simpsons isn't, I don't think, that it's become "grossly sentimental" (although I agree about the rest) - in fact, it seems as though it's lost much of its sentiment. Many inferior shows have copied the template of the Simpsons, but forfeited its moral tenor, its emphasis on family. Case in point:  The Family Guy . Ugh.   What the Simpsons is missing - and has been missing since Maude died (I don't particularly miss Maude - it's the way they killed her that gets me. Death by t-shirt? Come on.) - is that certain something that elevates it above shows like the Family Guy. A casual viewer likely would not be able to understand why Homer's family loves him, but watch episodes like "Lisa's Substitute" and "And Maggie Makes Three", and you'll get it. They're not hard to come across. I've dutifully watched about ten episodes of the Family Guy and I've yet to come up with any reason to like Peter Griffin, or any reason, for that matter, that his wife hasn't left him.  But look at episodes like "How I Spent My Strummer Vacation" (featuring a palpable absence of  Joe Strummer ), and you'll realize that the show no longer has the family unity that was at the core of its greatness before. Homer is once again desperate to be intoxicated; Lisa is embarrassed that her father is a roadie and pulls down her "DAD ROCKS" sign. I liked the episode because it made fun use of the celebrity guests, but I think the Simpsons are likely more sick of each other by far than we are of them.  I go on. All this is by way of saying that while I understand that the show is basically finished, I refuse to let go. And Futurama was too gimmicky to have ever really reached the calibre of the Simpsons - it was a fun show, but far too self-conscious and unsure of itself. I got sick of it pretty quickly, but I still hold out fledgling hope that the Simpsons will have a few more truly great episodes. I mean, who could have seen "Skinner's Sense of Snow" coming from the quagmire of Season Twelve? Anything is possible.

						    NINTH WIND NO MORE   Veterans of the all-nighter will understand me when I say that I can pinpoint the exact physical sensation informing me that I've hit the proverbial wall. It's 5:30 pm and I was notified about three minutes ago.  The feeling is often prompted by a conversation on the telephone, or more frequently, by someone asking you a question. I got both just now. It didn't help that the question was, "Do you think Bunuel's association of Eros with death symbolizes his belief that ultimate fulfillment is impossible?" Sure! I say run with it.  In any case the sensation is this. My head fills with cotton, facilitating a disconnect between my reflexes and the aural and visual clues that surround me. Believe it or not, this comes on all at once. My sensory abilities are thus narrowed to fixating on very specific things: for example, right now all I can hear is the sound of my typing. If someone were to speak to me, I doubt that I would respond. Directly after that, my eyes begin to burn and my knees and ankles begin to ache - or, at least, I notice these irritants for the first time.  Of course, this isn't time to sleep. Even if I weren't otherwise occupied this evening, I wouldn't sleep: I'd sit here playing Big Money with a completely numb brain until my heart rate was down to a dull roar. You see, in my experience, the body works doubly hard when it hasn't slept, because it needs a higher RPM, say, to function when it's exhausted.  So there's no way to win. I've entered the stage in this process when I am genuinely good for nothing: I can't work, I can't have fun, I can't sleep. Which brings me neatly to my final point: describing all of this makes me wonder why I wanted to take the trouble of describing it.  Back to Big Money.

						    ONE MORE THING   Returning to this paper of mine reminds me of one of  Leonard Cohen's  more recent verses:   Ring the bells that still can ring Forget your perfect offering There is a crack, a crack in everything That's how the light gets in   If I keep that approach in my head, I might be able to finish by the end of the day.

						    SPOTLIGHT HOG   One more very fun fact about Elizabeth before I get back to it: she ascended the throne, aged twenty-five, on November 18, 1558, and died March 24, 1603. Consider: her accession was the predicate of her sister  Mary  dying on that very same day. And her death forty-four years later prompted the accession of  James VI of Scotland, now James I of England , he of King James Bible fame.   But listen: it's not James's accession that they're going to be commemorating in England - it's the death of Gloriana. Even with a Bible on his CV, James doesn't cut it! Similarly, November 18 was celebrated years and years after Elizabeth's death as Accession Day or Crownation Day, so one can deduce that there was no particular ceremony accorded the date of a monarch's death. (Actually, the people during Elizabeth's reign sometimes got confused as to what they were celebrating: Elizabeth's accession or Mary's death, but that's a story for another day - or another hour, the way I'm going.)  So the Virgin Queen achieves monopoly over her birth and her death. The rest of us can only hope for so much.

						    THE WIZARD OF PAUSE   You'll all be relieved to know that I finally understand what I'm doing with this kinderculture manifesto, and so I elect that this is the perfect time to stop, as they say, for lunch.  This has given me a lovely opportunity to troll about the Interweb for news of my favorite dead (and surpassing, in my esteem, most of the living) person,  Elizabeth I , who ruled England in what is retrospectively seen as total triumph from 1558 to 1603. Popular fascination with her - and her infinitely ballsy mother,  Anne Boleyn  - has barely taken a breath since the 16th century, so there is a wealth of information available about both of them, although most of it should be foreworded with an enormous neon sign reading  CAVEAT EMPTOR     .  The  1998 film   Elizabeth , for example, is a complete disaster. To feel smug and angry at the same time, I once rented it with the express intent of committing to paper every single one of its inaccuracies. Don't get me wrong: I understand that the entire medium often requires quite a bit of fooling about with history (remember how fond I was of the Christmas trees in  The Lion in Winter ), but this film took history and made it boring, confusing and unnecessarily violent.  In any case, I'm very excited to be venturing out to England on what will be, coincidentally, the  400th anniversary of Elizabeth's death . The nation will be commemorating her year-round, and instead of sitting in Edmonton singing praises to  Bruce McCulloch  and  West Edmonton Mall , I'll be standing in  Westminster Abbey  next to the effigy of the woman I love.  Lunch time.

						    THE CARS THEY SCREECH AT THE BREAK OF DAY   I would submit to anyone who regularly stays up all night to finish work that the hours between seven and nine o'clock in the morning are the most depressing minefields of human existence.  The transit buses start up, traffic jams begin, and for me, a steady hum of chatter begins outside my apartment door as people wait for the elevator. In Edmonton, the sun isn't up yet this close to the Solstice, but that doesn't matter: it's the noise that signals the transition. For me, it is not the beginning of a new day: it's the final nail in the proverbial coffin of yesterday. The prospect of staying up all night can be very exciting: it becomes an expanse of timelessness with every potential. Rush hour from within and without crushes such an idea. The night is gone, and suddenly the one who hasn't slept is just someone in pajamas whose work still isn't finished.  During my six-odd years as a student, I figured out that I'm one of those people who can only work at night. Even if I've got the day off, I'll usually wait until about ten in the evening to get down to things: I don't ask why; rather, I'm simply grateful to have at least that level of self-cognition. There are times when the night moves smoothly into daytime, particularly if I'm enjoying my work, and I won't notice that it's light outside or that the world has gotten noisier. I just keep going.  But there are instances, like this one, when I'm fixated staring out the window, watching people who are purposeful and punctual walk briskly to their destinations eleven storeys below. And I know that I'll be late for everything today, that my hair will stay messy, and that lack of sleep will have turned my attention span into such a narrow tunnel that I won't be able to carry on a decent conversation with anyone.  Worst of all, though, is knowing that this work will still be waiting for me when I get home tonight, and that tomorrow morning, this will all be happening again.

						    THE GLIMMER SIMPSONS   Well, I finally got around to watching  How I Spent My Strummer Vacation  tonight. Season Fourteen has been a controversional subject for  Simpsons  fans, because the true blues out there know that the show has been going downhill ever since Maude Flanders died.  Embarrassing truth: I loved this episode.  How could I not? It had Mick Jagger, Keith Richards (yes, that really is Keith), Elvis Costello (I mean, damn!), Tom Petty... My boyfriend of many years finds it distracting to have too many guest spots, and most of the time I agree with him (case in point:"Tennis the Menace" from Season Twelve, starring Venus and Serena Williams, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras), but in this case, it made up for the Simpsons cast itself (with the exception, as always, of Apu, for whom, incredibly, there is no character file at SNPP - follow link above) being, well, pretty boring.  It's fairly true that most of the non-musically oriented things that Mick Jagger affiliates himself with identify him as fairly over the hill, but this stuff was great. My favorite part, though, was Lenny Kravitz's seminar on crotch-stuffing. Big laffs!  In conclusion, despite the fact that the episode that actually aired tonight was the worst of the worst, I'm going to keep watching.  Troy McClure  didn't know how right he was when he said, "Who knows what kinds of adventures they'll have between now and when the show becomes unprofitable?"

						    THE THINGS YOU LEARN!   .... that aren't about sociology.  Something tells me that learning how to operate this site is going to be a slow process, much like learning how to use the state-of-the-art Nikon camera that my father gave me for my birthday. There is a genuine void in my brain where numbers and codes and the sequence of instruction should be: I can win the  Mactaggart Writing Award , but I can't seem to remember what anything resembling HTML or the word "flashcube" means. I suppose people are special in myriad different ways.

						    THE VIRGIN SPLEEN   It's 4:30 in the morning and there are numerous things sucking my life force from me. The first is a game called  Big Money . Big Money is what I do when I should be writing papers about the child's role in the economy. Try it, if you haven't got anything to do for the next nine years. It requires absolutely no skill, and at the same time makes one feel as though he is truly accomplishing something. You achieve status as you move along: I've been a Venture Capitalist, but don't be hard on yourself if you don't get there right away. I've been playing for a long time.  The other thing eating away at me is the text of the sources I'm using for this paper. Listen to this: "It is an injunction not to fall into either the abstract individualism that takes the child to be a self-contained, isolated entity, or into the equally abstract holism, structuralism, or determinism that sees individuals simply as causal effects or epiphenomena of either genetic or social determinants."  Let me just say first that you don't find this kind of writing in history texts, not really. Thank you, Marx Wartofsky's translator. This is from an article called "The Child's Construction of the World and the World's Construction of the Child: From Historical Epistemology to Historical Psychology".  Quel  pizzazz. You don't find "epiphenomena" or other words that I can't find in my dictionary (an Oxford, thank you very much) in history texts. Or Judith Krantz novels, for that matter.  My position is that these authors are deliberately oblique because they know that the salient and important things they have to say can be summarized and easily understood on one page. And one page doesn't fill a book. I'm not a stupid person. If I looked at this article long enough - preferably from a distance of about three feet - I could certainly understand it. I just get frustrated with points that can be easily distilled into, say, English, and aren't, all for the sake of wankery and a word count.  I can't use the word "wankery" for at least a week now.  Night night.

						   THE ANCIENT SUNKEN CITY OF ATLANTA  I'm moving to Ithaca, and I'm excited about it.   In my efforts to get out of Edmonton, I've come across a creative writing program at Cornell University that I might deign to participate in. It's benefited from the ministrations of writers like Kurt Vonnegut and Adrienne Rich, and the student's thesis is a novel. The only thing I can't decide is whether to get them excited now about my coming, or to surprise them when the time comes.  Seriously, the program takes four students in prose fiction every year, and I haven't got a prayer. And no Cornell means no Ithaca, because, well, it's a college town, and of its roughly 30,000 inhabitants, about 24,000 are students. I believe the rest of them run antique stores.  Actually I'm writing a story at the moment, and I encountered a crossroads deciding where to set it. I'm only twenty-four and I've only lived in two provinces, so really I can only write about Alberta and BC convincingly (and maybe the South, since that's where my family, em, hails from). But I looked up Ithaca anyway, here: www.visitithaca.com.   I want to live there.   Imagine! Within hours' distance of Montreal, New York City, and Boston, and there are seasons! I'm one of those people who needs a clear demarcation of the seasons to feel sane. Even when I lived in Terrace, BC, the climate was too much like the UK's for my comfort - basically rainy year-round. But the site says that the mean temperature in January is 25 degrees (F). Whatever other Canadians might say, I love the snow.  I have an idea: let's start a petition. Let Sarah Go To Cornell. Let her touch the face of the Ivy League the way air shows touch the face of God.  Sigh.

						    AH SO!   Well, I'm just out from finishing  Lost  in the bath (lost in the bath - heh - it really is a huge tub), and I grudgingly admit that it ended better than it began. My recommendation, should Mr. Maguire be interested, is that the next time he writes it, he should start about seventy-five pages from the end and expand on that. Just about everything preceding it was rubbish.  You'll remember that I was  complaining  about this book not too long ago, and I said:   When I create characters, they're just that: creations, constructions, bits of me and my mother and my cousin and my imagination. Characters don't come to me - nor, I daresay, do they come to other writers - as apparitions in the night, ready-made, complete, with no work and no blockage and no suffering involved. The germ of a character will come that way, but not the whole person, appearing like Jacob Marley in your doorway with his memoirs in his hand .   Well, imagine my surprise when I came across this write-byte in Mr. Maguire's  FAQ :   It is the nature of ideas�I think�that they rarely appear full-blown, like the visitation of an angel or a muse or a fairy godmother, but they grow in good soil, like a pumpkin or a hollyhock.    So if we're in agreement, and if Winnie Rudge was indeed drawn to be an unenviable character, then why do her characters follow  her  around, just waiting to be committed to the page? It's not fair. I admit that I don't often think very clearly, but sometimes I honestly believe that I would surrender every one of my happinesses to be able to create one whole character.  But other times, like now, I honestly believe I just want to lie down. Besides which, were I Gregory Maguire or Winnie Rudge, I'd come up with better names for  my  characters.

						     LOST  WITHOUT A FAIRY TALE   By the way, I told you I'd update you on my latest  Gregory Maguire  adventure, and so here it is: I'm not finished the book, and I  really  don't like it. I'm telling you: the only novel about a writer worth reading is  The World According to Garp , and even then, if you're thinking of blasting into writing, you can't take Garp too seriously, because the end result will be you as a gas jockey living with your parents.  The protagonist, Winnie Rudge, is a writer who can't escape her over-the-top storytelling imagination or the mental plague of the characters she's created.  Honestly . If writing were really like that, while writers were living their lives, they would never be able to give interviews because they'd be too busy writing Wonderful Stories.  I take novels about writers probably a bit more seriously than I should, because I take cues about writing wherever I can find them. If the man who wrote  Wicked  is going to tell  me  what goes on in the mind of a writer, well, I'm going to listen to him. But this stuff just isn't believable. When I create characters, they're just that: creations, constructions, bits of me and my mother and my cousin and my imagination. Characters don't come to me - nor, I daresay, do they come to other writers - as apparitions in the night, ready-made, complete, with no work and no blockage and no suffering involved. The germ of a character will come that way, but not the whole person, appearing like Jacob Marley in your doorway with his memoirs in his hand.   I wish I had the book here at the office so I could hammer out an exerpt for you, but I'm sure I'll get to that later.  A friend asked me, "If you hate the book so much, why are you still reading it?" The answer is that I paid twenty-five dollars for it, and that's an investment, and I'm still holding out hope that the ending will somehow make the entire disastrous rest of the book make some kind of sense. Gregory really looks like such a nice man, and I won't hold one bad book against him, so I'm still rooting for it. And of course I'll buy the next one when it comes out.

						    DRIBS & DRABS   Blogger has warned me strenuously regarding the bandying of ampersands in a cavalier fashion, but to hell with it. We'll see what happens.  I'll get back to my Oscar predictions in a bit (and my rant about Renee Zellweger - see link below), but right now I'm on borrowed time at work, so I'm going to share this delicious moment from  Stephen Fry's  first-twenty-years autobiography,  Moab Is My Washpot , and fly away:   Over the next year at Uppingham I bought [the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band's] other albums, Gorilla, A Doughnut in Granny's Greenhouse, Keynsham and finally Let's Make Up and Be Friendly, their last, which contained [Sir Vivian] Stanshall's short story, 'Rawlinson End' which I can still recite by heart and which he went on to develop into that outre fil masterpiece, Sir Henry At Rawlinson End starring Trevor Howard as Sir Henry and J.G. Devlin as his butler, Old Scrotum, the wrinkled retainer. When I first heard the joke, 'Scrotum, the wrinkled retainer,' I laughed so much I honestly thought I might die of suffocation .  I laughed pretty hard myself, so it was probably pretty stupid of me to read this to someone  while he was driving .

						    FOILED!   Well, I really did sit down to write to you last night, but Blogger was down for maintenance, so I missed my window. It's just as well, because I was in a full-tilt panic over what I was going to say - it's been a few days, and I know I have to say something, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out what. The entry was going to turn into something angsty and icky about the bankruptcy of my brain, so I think all of you should take a minute and thank Blogger for anticipating my coming and shutting right down.

						    BECAUSE I SAID SO   It seems like my life has been full of movies lately, but all I can think of is that there's  still  no information on the  remake  of The Lion in Winter, my favorite movie ever. I have noticed, though, that all the official postings on the matter seem to have taken the word "January" out of their collective lexicon. So who knows when  anything  will happen.  In other news,  Entertainment Weekly  has released its  Oscar predictions  for this year, a subject I find wildly exciting, and that the beat of my heart finds less so.  EW doesn't actually do much in this piece: they list off about nine thousand movies and actors, hoping, I suppose, for the best. I feel like I've seen enough films to make something approximating an educated guess on this matter, but I've found the Best Picture category a bit boring for a few years now, so let's move on to actors.  I hate  Nicolas Cage . I wanted to puke when I saw him bawling in  City of Angels . But if he doesn't get a Best Actor nomination for Adaptation. , I'm going to howl and break something really expensive. My thoughts are similar on  Christopher Walken  for Best Supporting Actor in  Catch Me If You Can , although I loved Christopher to begin with.  I found  Viggo Mortensen  completely charming in  The Two Towers  - any actor who almost dies on the set deserves some sort of recognition - but I'm fairly sure that he, and his costars, will be swallowed up by the film itself.  For posting later: I hated  Gangs of New York , and I have mixed feelings about  Leonardo diCaprio . I have an explosive rant about  Renee Zellweger  just begging to be let out of my brain. I will come back to all of this: I'd write it now if I weren't so tired.   Night night.

						    BRIEFLY   Just a short note to let you know that I'm still alive. I find that I write the way a friend once accused me of drinking: I'm a sprinter, which is to say that I drink (write) a whole bunch at a time, and invariably pass out before the fun really starts.  Anyway, I'm ridiculously tired. More soon.

						    FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY   Julian Martin directed me to a  religion selector  this morning, with interesting results. It's a bit like the quizzes administered to children (well, administered to me, anyway) to determine what career path they should follow. I'm not entirely sure what purpose such a mechanism should serve: I'm convinced that most self-respecting people would not like to admit that they came to God  via  a Web quiz.   Nonetheless I heartily recommend the exercise for sheer fun:  this belief mishmash  was at the top of my list when I took the quiz - it's probably where they direct all of the undecideds. My parents might be disappointed to see that  Reform Judaism  was only Number Eight on my list of appropriate choices, and, remarkably, that it trailed behind  Mainline to Liberal Christian Protestants , whatever that means.  Remaining in an Internet cafe, I can't listen to the "Religion Selector Theme Song", but I'll try it as soon as I'm alone with some speakers.

						    SMATTERINGS   For the first time I'm posting from an Internet cafe, boasting, oddly, "14 Different Kinds of Hot Chocolate!" I'm always wary of using other people's computers, mostly because I'm afraid that I won't like the keyboard. Similarly, when I was a girl, milk was my favorite drink, but I would never ask for it at my friends' houses, because I was worried that the temperature of their refrigerators wouldn't be  just so , that the milk would be too warm, or too thick. But this keyboard meets altogether with my approval. I'm sequestered upstairs in the smoking section, and it feels strangely like home, only without, perhaps, the call of dishes to be washed and garbage to be taken out. I'm feeling very warm and tired, though, and it's saddening to know that there's no lovely cocooning bed ten feet away, that I might fall into for a nap when I'm finished here.  I'm off for my second viewing of  The Two Towers  tonight, and I'm a bit excited because it feels like I haven't seen it at all, and despite my  complaining  earlier, I love the whole exercise of going to movies, especially when the seats recline. Hence, despite the fact that I would probably have my pick of seats at Silver City tonight, I'm determined to go to South Commons, where it feels like I'm at least approaching getting my money's worth.  In other news, I got the new  Gregory Maguire  book,  Lost , today, and I'm about fifty pages into it. Expect a review, though not too shortly, because reading  Wicked  wasn't nearly the protracted experience that it should have been, and I plan to drag this one out.  In any case,  Colby  warned me last night that he was going to make my  sympathy for Nabokov  public, but I feel the need to defend myself: don't you ever feel sorry for goalies? If you'd seen the first period of that game last night, you would have too: he let two goals in within the space of what felt like about 20 seconds, and honestly, there isn't any direct way for a goalie to redeem himself from that sort of muck-up. He's stuck there in the net, and unless the players out on the ice make up for his shortcomings, any loss or tie will be placed squarely on his shoulders. It's very sad, really.

						    WHEN SISTERHOOD WAS BLOGGING   I was flattered to find myself on a list of  "Women Bloggers" , also called "Roses of the Blogosphere", linked off of the  Reflections in D Minor  page. It made me realize that we're sort of wrecking the word "woman" now, though - "Women Bloggers," "Women & Song"... it could be just me, but... well... I'm not going to say that it looks very aggressive, but that it looks deliberately aggressive, as though the titles themselves were challenges rather than simply informative snippets.  On the other hand, when I was a girl I thought that "woman" was the most beautiful word in the English language, and I absolutely couldn't wait to be one. In fact, I went through a brief period (haw haw) when I felt very sorry for all the boys who would never be women. So there.

						    THOUGHT FOR THE NIGHT   ... From the incomparable  Stephen Fry :   Estate agents. You can't live with them, you can't live with them. The first sign of these nasty purulent sores appeared round about 1894. With their jangling keys, nasty suits, revolting beards, moustaches and tinted spectacles, estate agents roam the land causing perturbation and despair. If you try and kill them, you're put in prison: if you try and talk to them, you vomit. There's only one thing worse than an estate agent, but at least that can be safely lanced, drained and surgically dressed. Estate agents. Love them or loathe them, you'd be mad not to loathe them .

						    THE IDES, AGAIN    Avril Lavigne  came on the radio today while I was driving - surprise surprise. American and other non-Canadian readers will know who I'm talking about, I think, because I've now seen her on the cover of  Teen People   and   Seventeen  magazines, for reasons passing understanding. Does no one realize that there's absolutely nothing interesting about this girl? There are people who complain that she's taken the rebellion out of girls wearing neckties, but what was ever really  in  that? Come on. All the girls did it in the eighties, man. You were just distracted by their hair.  And as for the fact that she doesn't smile, well, she looks like she didn't get an MP3 player for her birthday, not like she's in a perpetual state of ruminating on society's ills. I mean, this is a girl who went on the Tonight Show and told  Jay Leno  that the house where  The Shining  was filmed is  really  haunted, because she went snowboarding around there, and, like, the trees were, like,  looking  at her.  I came across an  article  on  AskMen.com  stating that Avril kept "the public spotlight fixed on her" by lambasting  Britney Spears's  claim to virginity, and subsequently claiming that she and Britney are nothing alike (check out their official sites side-by-side, by the way - they're both provided here, and they look pretty much exactly the same).  Christ  Almighty .  Does  anyone  care whether or not Britney Spears is a virgin anymore? Like,  anyone ? She's twenty years old! Stop telling her how to live her life! LET HER HAVE A VOICE! Oh, whatever.  Anyway, Avril's right: she's not entirely like Britney. My feeling is that if Britney and  Eminem  had a daughter (not entirely out of the question), Avril Lavigne would happen  all over again . She'd have her mommy's big eyes and her daddy's big pout.  I've gotten way off track here. What I meant to share with you was my revelation that I now know what growing up is: it's listening to Avril Lavigne on the radio, and thinking about how much younger she is than you, and realizing that she got a record deal and you didn't, and that she's got everything to live for, and you're about to lose control of your car. Do you ever get that feeling? That even though you've been driving for years, and there's barely any traffic, and conditions are excellent, you're just going to fly off the road, and that it's an act of God, but that  your  insurance will go up because of it? Yeah, Avril Lavigne does that to me.

						    AW JEEZ, REALLY?   An  InstaPundit  reader writes:   On Friday night we saw The Two Towers, and when Legolas swung himself backwards onto that moving horse, I think I got pregnant .  Really?  Orlando Bloom  is, of course, beautiful to look at, but I've never considered him attractive in any kind of sexual way (although when I first read this, I thought that Orlando himself had said it, and I got a kick out of  that ): he's like something that you buy at  Chintz & Company  for too much money, and then put in your living room to lean umbrellas on. Certainly not something that gets you pregnant; nothing that could play a male elf so convincingly would make anything as dirty as  sperm .  Do I love Orlando? Of course! as Troy McLure would say. Like I love Fresca! But I leave the pregnancy-inspiring moves to... well, hopefully someone during my thirties.

						    HISTOIRE ET SOCIOLOGIE DU STRIP-TEASE   That's the title of a book I came across this morning. Here are some definitions of the term "strip-tease" (sorry, you'll have to mentally add the accents yourself):  Le Petit Larousse:  n. m. (de l'anglais to strip, deshabiller et to tease, agacer). Deshabillage suggestif execute en public sur une musique de fond ou de danse .  Le Dictionnaire edite a l'occasion de l'Exposition Internationale du Surrealisme:  Devetement progressif d'une dame dont la savante lenteur excite sournoisement les sens   .  And finally, the coolest one of all:  Le Dictionnaire de Sexologie:  Pantomime erotique, spectacle ayant pour object le deshabillage d'une femme jusqu'a nudite complete sur le rythme d'une musique particuliere ... et sur une trame justifiant ou rendant explicites les attitude de l'effeuillage .  I'd translate this, but I don't really think it's necessary... the French certainly have a - well,  frisson  - that we can't manage over here. I mean, I'm sure that there are dictionaries and glossaries of sexuality in English, but are they half as exciting-looking as Le  Dictionnaire de Sexologie ? As an area of study in the English-speaking world, sexuality is totally  desexified  (if that's not a word, I'd like to consider myself its inventor); I'll bet the French can't desexify their hernia operations.  My French is rustier than it should be, considering that I was, well, "immersed" in it from 1983 to 1998, but listen to this: "Jean Cocteau lui-meme, presentant a la presse un spectacle compose de trois de ses pieces en un acte, declarait, peu de temps avant sa mort, que ce spectacle representait pour lui un "veritable strip-tease de l'ame".  Clunkily: "Jean Cocteau himself, presenting three of his pieces to the press, declared shortly before his death that the spectacle was for him a  virtual strip-tease of the soul ."  When I was in Paris, I didn't have a great time. I was sick, and the people weren't nice, and I found London and Amsterdam to be full of far more amiable people. But I have to step back occasionally and admire the lilting sensuality of the French language - in evidence anytime except those when someone spits to you that you really did order a box of tampons, not a box of tissue.  I've been looking at this book for about an hour now, and quietly revising my travel plans to spend a bit more time in France. We'll try to fix it so that I don't actually have to communicate with anyone: I just want to listen.

						    SIGH   Well, it looks like my fifteen minutes are up. I just checked my hit counter and things seem to be quickly slowing (quickly slowing?) to their pre- InstaPundit  rates. Well, that's not precisely true: having been an unknown with nothing of import to say, I am now a  semi-known  with, well, nothing important to say.  I wonder if the issue is that this site has no clear mandate, because even if that's the case I've no desire to give it one. Not having attended graduate school, I find it difficult to stay on any one topic for any great length of time: after a while, I'll even start to find  myself  boring.  Actually, I had no plan to advertise this site, although I'm flattered that it's been mentioned. With my fourteen-odd readers a day, I was able to keep the site on the level of pure whimsy, doing whatever I wanted with it, flooding it or ignoring it. But then I got the readers. All glory is fleeting. Beware the Ides of March. I didn't mind not having them - I was a bit gobsmacked by the attention, in a good way - but I  do  mind having  lost  whatever fraction is gone, because it forces me to face the notion that there's a population out there that I failed to hook.  Although I'm sure the situation wasn't helped by the fact that I hadn't posted in a couple of days.  Ah well. I do go on. I'll be back soon.

						    COMA   I was thinking yesterday that Colby Cosh always warns us when he's going offline for a while, and that I probably should have done the same. I've been moving for the last three days (anyone who knows me will know how three days could easily be taken up to move  me  out of a bachelor apartment), and am now back with my parents for the weeks prior to my departure for England. This means that my computer is currently in pieces on the main floor of the house, and I'm writing you this short note from a strange one - the first one I've been able to get myself in front of since the last time I wrote.  In any case, please forgive me. I will be back tomorrow with much to tell, but for now I absolutely  must  go to bed. It's been a trying few days.

						    THE IDES, FOR PERHAPS THE LAST TIME   Well, I really wish that I didn't have to begin all of my posts by explaining why there's been such a lapse  between  posts, but it seems to be the nature of how I'm maintaining this site. In any case, I've been working almost every hour of every day since we last spoke on the  Students'  Union general election  here at the University of Alberta.   Unfortunately, every hour of every day is telling me that I'm too old for this now.  I'm serving as a "consultant," which is an exceedingly flattering moniker for someone whose sole superpower consists of the ability to sit around and tell nostalgic stories about the  Space Moose presidential campaign  in March of 1997. (Hey, it was a good time!)  But now I'm surrounded by people who were born in 1984, and even the ones who make it their business to know every fempto-iota of Students' Union history are getting it wrong (if you'd like a for-instance, and let me tell you that you don't, visit the  webboard  for the election),but if I point that out, they'll say, "What, were you  there  or something?", and  then  what'll I say? I mean, I still get carded in bars; I could certainly pass for an undergraduate student. If I don't tell them, they don't have to know.  This might actually constitute the first genuine age crisis I've ever had. The constant thought running through my head as I sit day after day in the Students' Union Building is "What the  fuck  am I still doing here?" Back in the day, I had big plans for being twenty-four, and none of them involved hanging on to borrowed glory from years past.   On the other hand, elections are fun, especially if you know things that, like, other people don't know. In six weeks I'll be across the ocean with award money; I really shouldn't complain. If Blogger is smart, it'll crash on me this time, exactly the way it has the last few times I've tried to post.

						    34DD OR BUST   I was just looking at my Referrals page, and to my shock, found that some poor soul had arrived at my page by doing a search for "sarah 34dd". How did he  know?   Actually, that's not entirely true. I went on a field trip to get myself properly fitted about two years ago (by NASA, I sometimes think), and found out that my size - I didn't know this even existed - is 32-G. Yes, 32-G. It's too ridiculous to even be sexy. I mean, if you said, "This girl Sarah, she's got huge boobs and a really long tongue," someone might think that was sexy, but slap the actual measurements on it, and suddenly it's just comical.  The weird thing is that they're really not all that big. Sure, they're not  small , and my overall frame is a bit disproportionate to them, but they're not the biggest I've ever seen, by far. Not Pamela Anderson big, or Queen Latifah big, just ordinary big. But when someone asks my size, I can tell that once they know, they're peering at me to see if there's any flesh they somehow  missed .  In any case, I think providence brought this man to my doorstep. If he comes back, at least he'll know that 34-DD is  nothing .

						    THAT'S MY BOY   Will  Peter O'Toole  deign to attend the Oscars or won't he? The Academy offered him an honorary Oscar last month, which he  declined  !  He stressed that he was "enchanted" by the idea, but that he considered it a consolation prize (nominated seven times between 1962 and 1972,  Entertainment Weekly  calls him a "lifelong Oscar bridesmaid"), particularly so soon after his seventieth birthday . From his letter to the Academy:   I'm still in the game and might win the lovely bugger outright; would the Academy please defer the honor until I am 80?   Although he might turn coat and come anyway, statements like these make me wonder if Peter was actually acting when he played Henry II (1154-1189) in  my favorite movie of all time .

						    BEST MOVIE  EVER , AND OTHER STUFF   Oh,  man . Thank God for  Eddie Murphy . I saw  I-Spy  tonight at the dollar theatre (or, as Mike appropriately calls it - charging $2.75 as it does - the Pound Theatre), and I know I haven't laughed so hard in months. And all you folks who think I'm a philistine, either go see it or suck it up: this movie  ruled .  I can't even remember anything specific about it that was great - except, of course, for  Owen Wilson  attempting to sing "Sexual Healing," and Eddie confessing, tearfully but proudly, that his grandmother was the first person who ever hit him in the face - but I didn't go for ninety seconds altogether without laughing, right from the beginning. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a) having a generally shitty day, month, or lifetime; or b) trying, as I am, to quit smoking.   Smoking Update : tonight I put on my seventh patch, and I'm experiencing something both queer and unexpected: I don't really feel the need to smoke anymore, but I genuinely  miss  it. I was told that there was an element of genuine loss in this process, but I didn't expect it to be so profound; rather, I expected to be relieved at not having to do this anymore.  One of the props getting me through this is a small pencil, the kind one would use to keep score at the Pitch & Putt. It's just about the exact length and circumference of an average cigarette, and I've been carrying it around with me wherever I go. Over the course of the past two or three days, there have been several occasions when I've gone outside as if to smoke, and simply held this pencil, trying to have the experience. NB: for any of you who know how to inhale, try doing it as a breathing exercise, rather than while smoking. It's remarkably relaxing, especially if you do it deeply. This is what has been getting me through.  For any non-smoking readers (especially those in northern Alberta who know how  bloody  cold it is outside), this probably sounds like nothing less than total insanity. In fact, not having had any in-depth discussions with people who have quit, I don't know that it  isn't  insanity. I know that I haven't smoked in the past week, but, considering my mood and general attitude towards people during that time, I'm not sure at the moment if it's totally worth it.   Colby  put the struggle in the best possible light, though: "If you're successful, you won't  have  to smoke. If you're not, you  get  to smoke! Everybody wins."   More soon. Night night.

						    SHE'S BACK, FINALLY   The prodigal daughter returns, minus about two-thirds of her existent readership, to write about nothing in particular.  Actually, that's not true. I have many wonderful things to say about the northwestern coast of British Columbia (did you know, for example, that BC calls itself alternately "Beautiful British Columbia" -  via  license plates - or "Super, Natural British Columbia" to promote tourism? The interesting thing about that is that  this  is what came up when I did a search for the latter.). You'll be happy to know that they're still complaining about Gordon Campbell over there - in fact, my aunt, an elementary school teacher, heard this from one of her sixth grade students:   Q: What did Gordon Campbell say when he was arrested in Hawaii? A: "I should have let the hooker drive."   Somehow it was funnier coming out of the child's mouth, but still.  I had a lovely time in BC, in any case, and it was actually nice to be without a computer for a while. Apart from spending time with my family, I sat in front of a woodstove in flannel pajamas, reading books and drinking tea and eating sandwiches, and, apart from occasionally bringing in firewood, I generally didn't stir to make much use of myself. They were the most perfect three weeks in my living memory.   In other news, I'm growing hideously fat in my attempt to quit smoking. I couldn't tell you how much the  NicoDerm  patch is helping, because I've never tried to quit without it, but in the last... oh, 58 hours, I've chewed gum, stir-sticks, pencils, and truly gargantuan quantities of food in the effort not only to not smoke, but to not  think  about smoking. The coolest thing about it, though, is that the patch makes you have incredibly vivid, bizarre dreams. As an example, the first night, I dreamed that  Paul Bettany  had fallen in love with me, and wrote me a nine-page letter telling me so, but he was such a terrible speller that I turned him down. I don't think he had his British accent in the dream, though. I could never have turned  that  down. In any case, I'll certainly keep you posted on how it goes.  Finally, and with a sigh of relief, I'd like to be one of many to welcome  Kelly Jane Torrance  back to the Web; she was sorely missed.  Back soon.

						    BUSH'S LEAGUE   A  review  of David Frum's recent book about George W. Bush tries to tell us that Bush has the makings of a great President, specifically a "natural wartime leader". As a Zionist and a supporter of the current war in Iraq, I need little convincing of Bush's stance on foreign policy (although I've heard some terrible - and credible - rumors that the US is withdrawing funding from abortion clinics in poor countries throughout the world, poor countries being where such choice is perhaps most needed).  The problem that I have is that all you ever hear about Bush is his stance on foreign policy. Those who agree with it already do, and those who don't will not change their minds;  ergo  it is useless to keep beating that particular dead horse. At election time last year, I heard tell that Bush has a domestic agenda:  that's  what I'd like to hear about. I won't sit here and say that it's nonexistent, but no one ever hears about it. Certainly it's bad PR for the current US administration if the war is all the public hears about - underneath the loud voices of antiwar protesters (and the splat of their vomit, in San Francisco, anyway).  If the war is all the people remember in 2004, Bush hasn't done his job. An analogy is this: at the end of the sixteenth century, there weren't really more Protestants in England than there were Catholics: it just happened to be that the Protestants were far louder, and so they're the ones we remember. Our own contemporary protestants are making noise all over the world - far more so than Bush's supporters. Shouldn't the White House be worried about that? Those against the war stand firmly behind their convictions, and few if any of them will be swayed. So in a couple of weeks, it would be encouraging if we stopped hearing only plainsong from DC. After all, there is a country to run.

Of course, her death shouldn't be what we remember, but that it provoked unprecedented sadness amongst her people:   Westminster was surcharged with multitudes of all sorts of people in their streets, houses, windows, leads and gutters, that came to see the obsequy, and when they beheld her statue lying upon the coffin, there was such a general sighing, groaning and weeping as the like hath not been seen or known in the memory of man, neither doth any history mention any people, time or state to make like lamentation for the death of their sovereign .  And now she  lies still in Westminster Abbey , and her room continues to be the only one in the edifice where silence is required at all times. Bless you, Gloriana.

						    I REALLY LIKE PEOPLE WHO AGREE WITH ME   I was looking on the Web recently for Paul Johnson's feelings about the war when I came across a series of reviews of his books. The review for  A History of the English  piqued me in particular, because it was obviously written by someone who is incapable of contextualizing history. Johnson is "comical" because he favours Elizabeth I over the Stuarts? Check this out:   [Elizabeth I] "was forced, with great reluctance" to persecute the Catholics and the Puritans, because "both groups, in the end, left her with little alternative."   The reviewer speaks as though this weren't true! Consider first the arbitrary and cavalier manner with which her father persecuted heretics (as the BBC movie said, "I alone will decide who is too Protestant - or too Catholic"), and the fine line that everyone under his command walked. Then consider the maniacal re-Catholicization of England that her sister Mary tried to inflict, and all those - including Elizabeth's godfather Archbishop Cranmer - who died at the stake in the 1550s. What kind of monarch  wouldn't  choose to be moderate after having lived through that? The very foundation of both the reactionary Catholics and the new Puritans demanded that they be intolerable to a moderate Anglican state, and what is remarkable is the sheer number of people that Elizabeth, through evasiveness and cleverness, managed  not  to persecute.   James, on the other hand, was a "loutish savage." Indeed, Johnson is as expansive in his condemnation of the Stuarts as in his praise for Elizabeth.   Well,  why not?  The Stuarts  were  awful, and James in particular. Personally, if my choices were Gloriana, or the bunch of guys who  started the English Civil War , well, I think I'm with Paul. Not only did James empty the Treasury - not to free his daughter in Bohemia, no, but to pamper his favourites - and hurl abuse at the Prince of Wales and completely alienate the Crown from Parliament, he also devalued the entire nobility by creating baronetcies, titles that any old coot could actually  buy , helping along the growing tyranny of the merchant class (that's just a personal beef I have, but still). Elizabeth didn't have to bribe anyone to be  her  friend.  There are some people who simply shouldn't talk about this kind of thing. Like Judith Krantz, for example (a favorite girly author of mine and my best friend Raechel's): in  I'll Take Manhattan , she tries to illustrate the lunacy of a modern Scottish noble by saying, "Laddie thinks that the Queen of England should still be descended from the House of Stuart." Well, Aunt Judy, she  is . The descendents of Anne of Bohemia - the same daughter that James wouldn't rescue - founded the House of Hanover in 1714. Diluted Stuart, sure, but Stuart all the same.  In any case, if my mind's wrapped up in this right now, it's likely because next Monday is the 400th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's death. I'll be wearing black, you bet, and there will be, I'm sure, several moments of silence. If only this stupid war weren't distracting the English government.

						    QUEEN OF EVERYTHING (EXCEPT THE WEBBERNET)   In response to  Rick 's question: no, there is no current online version of the piece entitled  My Black Pages  which I submitted to the Magtaggart competition. However, there will be before I leave the country; such is the Faculty of Arts's vow. In any case, I spoke with the subject of my piece about a year ago, and not having read it himself, respectfully asked me to change his name. Coming up with a name that would seem to mean as much to me as the actual one has taken the better part of that year.  What you see online prior to April 30 will be a rather severely abridged version of the original piece. Most people say the shorter one is better, but all I see when I read it are the gigantic holes where text once was.  Anyway. I'm avoiding my job, and it will not stand.

						    I HATE TO GET DRAWN INTO THIS, BUT...   Stupid war. This could have been done so much better. Usually, my opinion is summed up by Homer Simpson in  Sideshow Bob Roberts : "I'm not really interested in politics. Personally, I think people who vote are a little  fruity ." I suppose this could be construed as a reflexive confidence in the system. After all, I  am  a monarchist. Not a Panglossian monarchist, but pro-inherited titles all the same.  I was gearing up to write about the war when I came across an  editorial  at  Salon  that expressed my view, misgivings and all, perfectly. Unfortunately you can only read a few paragraphs of it before you have to make a deal with the Devil, as it were.

						    I AM THE QUEEN OF EVERYTHING   I don't often feel pride, you know. I've been secure in every relationship that I've ever been in because I'm not conventionally or classically pretty, and I have no fortune to speak of - I have nothing to offer but my love, as it were. The men who have loved me have loved me for my mind - or else because they were just very silly people. So do I feel love? Yes. Confidence? Yes. Happiness? Sure. But  pride?  Rarely.  But  today , oh,  today . Today I presented to the Undergraduate Student Awards office a faxed version of an airline ticket, taking me and the love of my life from here to Calgary, from Calgary to Toronto, and from Toronto to London Heathrow, and do you know what they did? They gave me, Sarah Eve Kelly (should I link to myself?), a cheque for a very substantial amount of money! And it has my name on it!  The first thing I did - well, after dancing with glee around my dear friend the  Director of Information Services  in the Students' Union Building - was return to my own office and make two copies of the cheque, just, you know,  in case . What I saw on the copied cheques made me think of  Catch Me If You Can : the photocopy is covered -  covered - in the word  VOID . Crazy!  Anyway, I'm too excited to write well, so this is where I sign off, with every good wish to you all.

						    SMOKING UPDATE   I've held off writing this for a long time, first because I've gotten so many letters of support in my effort to quit, and second, well, because I'm just really embarrassed about this.  About ten days ago I fell off the wagon. Not totally, mind you, but non-smokers tend to take an absolutist viewpoint in matters such as these. "She smoked? A  cigarette ? She's a  smoker , by golly." In my case, falling off the wagon means that I started mooching cigarettes, or, rather, taking those offered to me. It was a terrible roller-coaster, because for a smoker, I'm surprisingly intolerant of cigarettes that aren't  my brand , and, seeing as I smoke menthol (we aren't really smokers: we're non-smokers with oral fixations), the only real way to ensure that I smoke my brand is to, well,  buy  it. Which I held off doing for a long time.  A lot of this concerns the election I was telling you about earlier. It took the piss out of me; I won't lie to you. And it took the piss out of everyone else: on campus, about 60% of non-smokers become smokers for that month-odd of banner-hanging, signature-getting, and poncing around in the  Discipline, Interpretation and Enforcement (better known as DIE) Board . Was I equal to that temptation? I was not.  This isn't by way of excuse-making. I am empty of excuses, just as this Diet Coke can next to me is empty of Diet Coke. You could say, to that end, that I've drunk all of my excuses. Or you could tell me that symbolism only goes so far.  What is the next step? Honestly, at the moment, I don't know. I've spoken with many people who either are quitting or who have quit successfully, and the only point they agree on - and this jives with the literature, too - is that the smoker really has to  want  to quit, and I'm just not sure that I'm there. I know that I have to at some point soon - either yielding to the fears and concerns of those who love me or simply making an autonomous decision - but there's one more hurdle that I have to jump first.  My stepfather,  Irwin Huberman  (interesting link, if not terribly informative), has been a prominent member of the  Beth Shalom  synagogue congregation here in Edmonton for more than a decade, and on March 30, alongside Ritual Leader Neil Loomer, he will be honored at a gala at the Westin Hotel. Needless to say, my mother, my brother, my sister and I will be in a genuine spotlight that night, and the way I look will be of more than passing importance to me. Last night, I found a beautiful dress (it really is  rather  smashing), which, if worn, by me, would help me to pay proper tribute to my wonderful stepdad.   There's just the niggly little point of fitting into it.  I'm close to fitting into it, don't get me wrong!  So close . But what happens if I try to quit smoking again? I help myself by eating. And then, far from being able to fit into it, I will cease being  so close  to fitting into it. So I'm going to revisit the smoking issue on the morning of March 31, and see where I find myself.  For the time being, though, I'm staying under five cigarettes a day, and I'm compromising my love for my own brand by smoking toasted air, otherwise known as the Deluxe Ultra Light version of my brand: the Poor Man's Benson & Hedges Menthol 100s.  Kindly understand and forgive. I value your support and I will continue to take comfort from it when I resume this battle - soon.

						    MORAL ADVERSITY, BROUGHT TO YOU BY PAMPERS    Colby  wrote  this stirring piece  yesterday morning about the current crisis in advertising (crisis? what crisis? I never know about these things). I don't think his concern is of an ethical nature, but whose is? He calls for a "moral self-examination of that industry," but I'm reticent about that: all I can see in my near future is basically the Oprah-fying of advertising in an effort to be more "honest" and "trustworthy," and that sounds boring as shit to me.  I make merciless fun of Mike for espousing what he calls the "intelligent consumer" - essentially, that in the best of all possible worlds, advertisers should be free to claim what they please, because individuals will make educated, informed decisions about what they invest in. But advertisers create a curious doppelganger of this concept: by saying "We know you're smart, and that's why you want Tampax," they effectively omit the consumer's conscious desire to inform himself about what he buys: if he buys Tampax (and he should, because his girlfriend will thank him for it), that means he's  smart , whereas going with, say, Kotex would make him ungovernably  stupid .  I shouldn't make fun of Mike: he is an idealist, and only idealists have ever changed the world. The only problem I have is that I'm an intelligent  person , but I have utterly failed to be an intelligent consumer. Three years ago I even called a psychic hotline and talked to some woman who was probably changing her baby's diaper for  five whole minutes , landing me a fifty-dollar charge on my subsequent phone bill - fortuitously, though, she told me that Mike was "the one" and that I should "stick with him".  That being said, though, I largely prefer advertising the way it is, mostly because I'm getting older and slightly wiser. The whining boredom of advertisers trying to be "honest" with me really just makes me want to drive a Number 2 pencil through my temple.

						    ONE MORE THING...   For an interesting article on Dr. Starkey, look  here . 

						
</post>

<date>05,March,2003</date>
<post>

						
						    THE LION'S CUB   I finally saw the first installment of  David Starkey 's (site relaunched shortly) documentary on  Elizabeth I . For all Canadians in the audience tonight, the next installment will be playing at 6:00 EST on the  History Channel .   It was pretty ordinary fare, but Dr. Starkey is very entertaining, as those of you who have seen him will know: he can turn the tilt of one hand into a pivotal moment in human history - and so he did, several times. For someone who is, no doubt, a "pop" historian, he seems to have garnered some degree of credibility - although the documentary itself seemed to be more snazz than substance.   The thing that got me about this documentary was  Imogen Slaughter , the actress/model/what-have-you who played Elizabeth herself. I won't say that it was an acting job outright, because most of her job, seemingly, was to stand amidst thousands of very Catholic-looking candles, staring off into the distance in a serious way. But something about her was truly striking: her appearance was perfect. The producers resisted the temptation to cast someone particularly pretty: Ms. Slaughter was simply stark, pale, red-headed and very thin. One's eye wouldn't pass her over, certainly, but she's no  Cate Blanchett , and a good thing, too.  On a similar note, the aesthetics of this piece seem to commend it most: the scene where  Thomas Seymour  (sorry, this was the best link I could find on a tight schedule) - assisted by his wife, Katherine Parr - cuts Elizabeth's gown to pieces in the garden of Sudeley Castle is obviously the result of very hard work, considering the set, the costumes and the camerawork, not to mention the intensity of the actors.  I do sort of wish, though, that someday, a documentary on Elizabeth will forego the tired timeline followed by Starkey in favor of something more interesting, looking at it from a different point of view. These pieces tend to emphasize the point that she was molested by her stepfather, offer that up as the sole compelling reason that she never married (there were a million and two reasons for this!), and fast-forward to plunk her straight into the  Tower of London  for the Wyatt Rebellion, like, five years later. Shake it up, people!  But one confession before I sign off: this particular installment ended, predictably, with Elizabeth's coronation in January 1559. How many dramatizations of this particular day have I seen? Enough to clog my memory - and bore it to tears. But Starkey's commentary was particularly rousing as the camera panned from the formidable ceiling of  Westminster Abbey  to Imogen's white, white face, and yes, I cried. For sheer entertainment, I recommend this series to you all.

						    WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET A SHOT IN THIS TOWN?   Now that the godforsaken election is over, my mind is free to percolate on headier, more important things, like contraception, and where I can get some.  This is unpopular, but I'm going to say it anyway, from the point of view of someone who's been in a steady-on, monogamous relationship for coming up on five years now: condoms suck. They really do. I can see where they're necessary in sundry situations, but not in mine, and for years I've sought just the right way to avoid them.  Seven months ago I found that way in  Depo Provera . You go in once every three months, get a slightly painful injection into the upper arm, and you're on your way, so to speak. Being the master of human error, this was a perfect solution for me, until I stopped being a student.  The University Health Centre is a wonderful place: you see a doctor, get a prescription, fill it, and then have it administered by a nurse. Not so in the real world! Now I have to go to a MediClinic, get the prescription, go to a pharmacy to get it filled, and then return to the clinic to get shot up. Yarg, as  Calvin  would say.  I guess this is one of the first telling experiences I've had as a Grown-Up. Soon they're going to be telling me that I shouldn't  want  contraception, because I'm passing my prime.

						    McDICK'S, TO THEE I WILL ALWAYS BE TRUE   Colby wrote recently,  here  and  here , about the decline in McDonald's appeal, and listed many reasons why they've been ousted by all of their competitors in every conceivable way. Well, he's WRONG. How could you possibly not consider...  price?  Back when I lived on the university campus, all I had near me was Wendy's, and I had to spend nigh on eight dollars to get myself a decent, filling meal. At McDonald's I've never had to spend more than five. It's a consideration to  some  people.  Also, no one goes to fast food joints to get a burger full of stuff that will fall out, and McDonald's is the only chain that has consistently understood this. There's no point in Wendy's, Burger King or A&W even having drive-thrus, because it's bloody fucking impossible to eat one of their behemoths while driving. In this way, the Quarter Pounder is a masterpiece.   And I think we can all agree that McDonald's still has far and away the best breakfast food - up to and including the breakfast buffet at the Westin Hotel.

						    SOME FATHER'S DAUGHTER   A recent email from my father in Albuquerque updated me on his position concerning the war in Iraq, and also contained this bemused statement:   I've been looking in on your blog occasionally. I now have everything I need to know if I decide to make you a gift of some underwear.   Oops.  Now, as you've seen, both Mom  and  Dad have weighed in on my subject matter. Although it's lovely to have feedback, of a sort, Colby warned me about this, following an incredulous rant in response to my telling him that I'd voluntarily informed my family of this site. Unfortunately, I've also told professors, business associates, and other influential members of society, and so I've likely lost any number of potential guarantors for my passport renewal.  On a more important topic, however, I don't take gifts of underwear from anyone. A person simply cannot  win  buying underwear for someone else. Apart from the monumentally rare occasions when they fit, the pants benefactor runs a dual risk: if they're too small, well, they can't be worn and the recipient is embarrassed; and if they're too big, the recipient has one malefic question running through her head: "How in the name of bleeding Jesus did this person think I was that  fat ?"

						    A PERSONAL INVENTORY   My name is Sarah Eve Kelly, and I was born to Patte and Michael in North Vancouver on November 12, 1978. I am a left-handed monarchist. I am five feet, one inch tall; for my weight, consult Janeane Garofalo's claim that on any given day, she stands between 120 and 150 pounds. I have dark red hair and big, fat green eyes. I've been told that one of my eyebrows is balding, but they're very nice all the same. I don't tend to wear anything but black, but it's not because I'm Goth or depressed or Making A Statement. I look good in black.  I have two brothers, John (Alberta) and Robin (Ontario), two sisters, Jessica (Ontario) and Irene (New Mexico), two stepparents, Irwin (Alberta) and Helen (New Mexico), and a cat, Eleanor.  I boast a Bachelor of Arts in History, specializing in early modern England, from the University of Alberta in Edmonton, where I currently live. Reluctantly I drag behind me a minor in English, much like a can of beer tied with a very long rope to a car that has "JUST MARRED" scrawled across the back. The spectacular uselessness of literary theory has been the always-already subject of all manner of run-on sentence in my personal history.  I have a boyfriend (much as that word reminds me of slow-dancing behind the couch in the seventh grade), Michael Chalk, who has been with me for coming up on five wonderful years. He is six feet, two inches, with brown-blond hair and brown eyes, and he is completely, devastatingly beautiful. Soon we will be in Europe together, loving each other more and more, and running out of money.  I am largely flummoxed by current events: I have opinions about Israel and smoking bylaws and, occasionally, Australian referenda, but generally I find anything that happened after 1714 difficult to process. I've received a surfeit of grief over my politique-critique blind spot, but I'm more than contented to occupy myself between Eleanor of Aquitaine's adventure on Crusade and the Golden Speech of 1601, so there will be no tears for me.  When I grow up, I want to write novels. Writing fiction is the only thing for which I have any modicum of discipline. Oh, and smoking. I'm a very disciplined smoker.

						    SARAH EVE KELLY, MAN LOVER   A concerned reader writes:   It is my understanding that you feel men should not be permitted to ever enjoy having orgasms? If so, could you explain to me your viewpoint on this; also what effect would this have on males?   I'm assuming that this refers to my long-ago  post on fellatio in Blue Velvet , in which I claimed that fellatio is not a disempowering act for women, and that, in fact, it's far more dangerous to men than intercourse.  Here's my stance writ short: that I love orgasms, and everyone should have them, and certainly, that everyone who has them should enjoy them. I think what I was trying to say - and apparently failing at - was that women are  not  served by denying men orgasms, or by punishing men for having them. Pardon me while I quote myself: "Who is served by only one person having a good time?" I firmly (heh) believe that sex should be an entirely reciprocal act, at least over the long term.   I love orgasms and I love men, and the point I tried to make in that post is that everyone, I mean  everyone , deserves to get off.  Everyone!

						    WHATEVER, STEPHEN   You'll have to pardon my monstrous absence. Between my mom's birthday and the Beth Shalom gala (which sadly largely overshadowed Mom's birthday, but we're going to do it again), this past week has certainly kept me on my toes. But now I'm back, and I'm angry.  For some reason passing understanding, I took  Colby  to see  Dreamcatcher  last night. Actually, I understand perfectly: the first two hundred-odd pages of Stephen King's book were perfectly wonderful, almost to the point of moving me to tears. I stopped reading when it became all about the alien invasion and government conspiracy theories, because I can't think of anything more boring. But enough about the story, and more about why I'm angry.  I've been told - and I believe - that it's dangerous and devaluing to quantify love. That being said, if asked at the gates of Heaven whom I loved the most in the world, my answer would be far-and-away simple: my brother John. I hate to always have to put this first about him, but he's autistic. Autism is a mental disorder that primarily inhibits communication, provoking sustained repetitive activity, extreme sensory awareness (their hearing has been called canine), obsessive behaviour and a pronounced preoccupation with motion. Autistic people rarely, if ever, show affection except by means of deference to authority, and John is little different.   Most of the time, I sincerely believe that my love for John is the only part of me that is absolutely good and pure. For me and my family, he represents a kind of redemption: he demands unconditional love simply by virtue of who he is and what kind of life is ahead of him. My grandmother, before she died, called John my mother's guardian angel, and that's exactly what he is. Whether my love for him is selfish or not is a riddle to me.  What moved me the most about reading the initial portion of  Dreamcatcher  was the four main characters' devotion to the boy Duddits (who can't pronounce his real name, Douglas - although you would think that parents of a disabled child wouldn't call him by such a complicated name, particularly when Douglas can be shortened so easily to Doug). Their friendship was simple, and uncomplicated by idiotic and unfair generalizations about people with mental disabilities. To be fair, I didn't read the entire book, which may have betrayed Duddits's character as deeply and thoroughly as the movie did. In the movie, Duddits seemed to have little more than a speech impediment, which brings me to why I brought up my brother John in the first place.  Many of you my age or older will have seen or at least heard of  Rain Man , which was an amazing and remarkable film, but which gave the world at large a completely mythical  and false understanding of autism. Although Raymond's genius with mathematics - he was, of course, an autistic savant - was, in the film, thoroughly exploited and clearly did not represent the most wonderful and cherished of Raymond's qualities, most people now think that autistic people are  fantastic  because they have "special talents". Well, no. Only about ten per cent of autistic people are savants, and in most cases, their talents are esoteric bordering on useless. When people ask me what John's "special talent" is, I say that he can spit and hit an appointed target more than twenty feet away (he really can). Does a person with autism need to be able to multiply five-digit numbers in his head to be loved? Of course not... but am I the only one who thinks so?   Dreamcatcher  played into this mythology - first, that people with mental disabilities are possessed of eerie powers, and that their disadvantage in the world we see is compensated by a higher understanding of some other world, or by profound, simple wisdom. Second, that all people with disabilities are constantly sweet, strong and smiling. Do they have to be? Can't they have foibles? Aren't they allowed to be  flawed ?  People have to be so careful when representing the disabled. They can't be like the dad on CNN six months ago who said that living with his 10-year-old autistic son was a "constant nightmare", but nor can they make them all out to be ethereal angels with a cute lisp. Like any other marginalized or stereotyped group, they must be assessed and represented as individuals.

						    AND ONE MORE THING   This tops the list of Most Ridiculous Things Sarah Has Ever Read: an ad at a bus stop that Mike and I ran into a few hours ago: "ARE YOU SUFFERING FROM AUTISM? DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO SOMEONE?"

						    DUBLINIA   ... seems to be the name of a (modern reconstruction of a) medieval church or somesuch. I must say I'm completely gobsmacked by Dublin in general - the world's first and surest cultural victim of globalization.  I didn't realize the significance of the EU logo being on all of the license plates, and actually asked Mike why he was going on and on about it, until he illustrated his point for me by asking me to imagine all Canadian license plates with a big sign saying "NAFTA". That got my attention.  The cultural side of things is no better, I'm afraid, though it's just as much due to the fact that Irish culture - music, beer, and wooden tables - has been so expertly adopted outside Ireland, particularly in Canada. On Edmonton's Whyte Ave. there's a bar called O'Byrne's nestled between a soap shop and a Sorrentino's, and shit, if you want to experience Ireland, just head over there. This isn't a shot to Dublin - Grafton Street is a beautiful place, and Edmonton certainly doesn't have Oscar Wilde's first house. I was just expecting a culture shock, and am in shock because it never really came. For example, at this super-duper-ridiculously expensive Internet cafe (six euros per hour. I could go down the street and go into one that only charges two, but I can smoke here, and you're not the boss of me), I'm sitting in front of a flat-screen monitor listening to the Smashing Pumpkins. The other night I went into a lovely pub called the Bird Flanagan to write in my journal only to hear the Mamas and the Papas blasting from the speakers. At least at O'Byrne's you can hear actual Celtic music.  But I'm probably being too harsh. I'm hedging the Irish in with my expectations, I imagine: why should  they  bend over backwards simply to give me the experience I want? I'm part of the problem, honestly, with my fleece and my daypack and my Yank accent. I'm glad I'm only one person, and the fact that I hate the Smashing Pumpkins isn't  their  problem.

						    YES, I KNOW I'M AWFUL   ... but I'm writing from London! I just sent about seven extremely lengthy emails and I thought, why am I not posting? So here I am, very briefly.  The Internet cafes in London are like discotheques, really; it's a completely different experience. There are strobe lights and rave music and everything else you can imagine, except here, in the morning, where it's only a pound an hour. Can you imagine? Alberta is the cheapest place in the world to live - except maybe Israel - and the hourly rate there is more than twice as much as the most expensive city in the world.  But that's not nearly the best thing about this place. Thanks to the continually amazing generosity of the Mactaggarts, my primary benefactors for this trip,  this  is where I'll be staying in July, and London, unlike Canada, has Diet Vanilla Coke in CANS.  That's it from me. More from Dublin.

						    THIS IS RIDICULOUS   Without a lot of faffing about, I have this to say: I don't think I'll be able to keep this site up. Not that I  have  been keeping it up, of course - it's been two months now, after all. There are two problems: first, I'm on the move, which is, ironically, why I started this bloody thing in the first place. It causes trouble, though: usually a computer is only available to me for fifteen or twenty minutes at a time, and most of the computers around here (I'm in Cambridge now) are really rather, well, crappy.  Secondly, I'm  not  always on the move. For the last three weeks, for example, I've been in Sunderland, a mid-sized city just south of Newcastle, staying in a stately old home called Heatherbrae, where computers are never spoken of, let alone owned.  So this simple solution - which I thought would replace having to inform people individually that I was still alive - has become far more complicated than I originally thought. I don't want to make excuses for myself: believe me, my personal notebooks are filling up fast. But I was warned by a friend at the outset that I shouldn't take up weblogging if I wasn't able to really lean my shoulder into it, and I don't think I  am  able to do that - not at this juncture, at any rate.  This shouldn't alarm the last half-dozen people who are still occasionally checking this site. You probably knew that a  mea culpa  would come at some point or another, and here it is. So, until further notice, consider this weblog shut down until I'm resettled in Canada, which should be during the spring of next year.  With every good wish to you all.

						    COKE LIGHT MIT EIS, BITTE   Mike left London for Berlin on September 3; I stayed behind because I was attending a conference at the National Maritime Museum which fell under the general ( very  general) thematic umbrella of "Elizabeth I and the Expansion of England". Four days later, full of knowledge and, like Jeeves, brain bulging out slightly at the back, I boarded a  urlLink Ryanair  flight from London Stansted to Berlin Schonefeld (ticket price eleven pounds sterling, if-you-please: Canada has things to learn), bracing myself for things unknown.  Pause.  Here is why Mike and I were venturing to Germany, specifically - as if we needed a reason beyond, well, visiting Germany: we were enrolled in a workcamp hosted by  urlLink Service Civil International , an "voluntary service organization and peace movement" founded in 1937 to promote international understanding. The particular camp we attended was based in  urlLink Zeithain , about sixty miles south of Berlin, where our aim was to uncover and restore a camp used to house Soviet POWs during World War II. About which more later.  Zoom with me, if you will, back to Customs at Berlin Schonefeld (apart from airplanes, Customs lineups are the worst places in the world for smokers), where absolutely nothing of interest happened. Except that I got a stamp on my passport, stamps being far too few in these days of putrid European fraternity and understanding.  But walk with me out the door of Customs, luggage safely stowed on trolley, and into the airport itself where, I realized with childish horror, all the signs were in a language I did not understand (my mother put it best: "Do you know what they have in Frankfurt?  Toddlers  speaking  German!") . After a panic-driven cigarette, during which each pull was inhaled about four times, I walked back in, hiding behind my trolley, and pulled out two pieces of paper on which were written Mike's very careful, step-by-step, tried-and-true instructions for me to get out of this airport alive and in the right direction.  Please understand: this had never really happened to me before. I'd been to France (and I speak French), and Israel (with my parents, who speak Hebrew), and the Netherlands (and they don't really seem to bother much with Dutch there), but there I was, alone in a country in whose language I could not even count to three.  But I had my instructions. I was to buy a train ticket to Riesa (R-I-E-S-A, I banged into the ticket machine), and from thence take a taxi to a tiny village called Kreinitz, where all the campers were being housed in an abandoned school.  Extremely long story short: I did get there, alive and intact, to the quiet relief of both the man who loves me and the twenty-odd strangers who became my friends.  More soon.

						    MEANWHILE...   Back in England. Right.  There was absolutely no sign saying "Welcome To England" when we crossed the Anglo-Scottish border. There was nothing! Just Mike leaning over and saying "This is Berwick-upon-Tweed now" and us both falling back to sleep.  Speed through the arrival in Newcastle, one Metro trip to Sunderland, one trip to Jacky White's market (I got a purse), and one month headquartered at a beautiful house called Heatherbrae (where Mike and I were kept in royal style by his delightful family), and suddenly it's July and we're on the road again!  Loop back to my last Angloside entry, and you'll find us where we were in July, which is Cambridge.  Still with me, yeah?  Cambridge is a beautiful place. Someone slap me the next time I'm wandering around Edmonton affecting awe that a house was built in 1932. I don't think anything in Cambridge was built  after  1932 - including the Internet cafe where I posted my last (the power went out as soon as I was finished, so we all got a free, uh, surf).  I got the mandatory picture underneath the statue of Henry VIII whose sceptre was long ago stolen by bumptious students and replaced with a table leg (in itself a precious relic now - go to the photo at the very bottom left  urlLink here  to see), and found a solution to the pummelling thirty-degree heat at the market: a broom skirt that acted as its own breeze! One of my personal highlights was visiting the main store of the  urlLink Cambridge University Press  - a lovely few days altogether, visiting the alma mater of my hero,  urlLink Stephen Fry , about which more later.  Oxford was vastly more different than I was expecting: first and foremost, it was strikingly less, well,  grown-up  than Cambridge. There were hooligans yelling and beer bottles being flung in the streets almost constantly, people bashing into you and cursing, all the sorts of things that were virtually nonexistent in its reluctant sister city. We saw Bodley's Library (as Philip Pullman's Lyra would say), and the site where Cranmer, Latimer and Ridley were burned, and, loveliest of all, a late-night Sainsbury's with air-conditioning.  And it was in Oxford that my journal went missing.  O, reader. It was there the whole time I was at that pub! The whole time! And then I turned around and it was gone. Two months of the most exciting expedition of my life, gone. I honestly don't know what happened to it: why someone would steal it, I have no idea - after all,  I  know I'll be famous someday, and the book'll be worth something, but does anyone else know? Besides my mother? My mother wasn't in Oxford that night.  And so I began again.  Oxford was also the place where Mike and I began the countdown to London and our stay in Park Lane.  Park Lane!  Believe it. Ten magnificent days of smoked salmon, roast chicken, many, many television channels, and a bed wider than it was long. Also a view of Hyde Park. And complimentary housecoats. And a bidet. Never have I wanted to be so rich so badly!  That paragraph tells you basically everything you need to know about those ten days: while it was rapturous for Mike and me, it would bore/infuriate the average reader to tears. And so I shall say no more.  But I'm gloating on the inside.  We thought we would die a slow death in London without the luxury we'd grown so quickly accustomed to (eat shit, Glasgow Euro Hostel!), but we ended up very lucky very quickly: after a thoroughly unsavoury night spent in a hostel in King's Cross, Mike-the-genius found us a twin room in a University College London residence, Goldsmid House, which was right on Oxford Street between Bond Street and Marble Arch, and spitting distance from our former mansion. So there we were, back in Mayfair, for a pittance (in London terms, strictly speaking, natch). We had our own room, with a window I could smoke out of, and a beautiful view of Selfridge's by night (I'd link you, but there's no sufficient photo).  And what did we do? We stayed there, my friends, for  six weeks . It was supposed to be a few days - London's expensive, after all. But we couldn't bring ourselves to leave. Could you? What a grimy, derailing, tourist-clogged, theft-ridden,  beautiful  fucking city.  We're going back. I've decided I don't care if my children have English accents.  When we left London, we left England. Germany, Austria &c. next time.

						    RECONSTRUCTION OF THE FABLES   So, if you've been following my journeys for the last week or so, you'll have noticed that I made my site go BLAMMO with the touch of a button about six days ago. Well, mostly through bumbling and guesswork, I'm putting it back together. Who knew about HTML? The most impenetrable language since Finnish. Or Dutch. So while I'm figuring out what "h2" and blonk-ampersand-slash-zero-zero-pound-sign means, you'll just have to bear with me.  If you're even there.   Reader?

						    AND EVERY DAY IS LIKE A YEAR   Well, I've returned. Back in Edmonton, deflated, but happy. And I promised you all the news that's new and improved, from my computer, the sweetest-smelling computer in the world.  I left you in Cambridge, yeah?  I won't lie to you: I have no idea where to begin, and this is probably going to take several entries. But I'll begin the begin, as REM would say, and transport you straight to the Dublin Airport.  Never again will I agree to fly at seven in the morning - unless someone's dying - no matter how small the cost. I smoke too much when I'm tired. Mike and I landed in Glasgow at about eight o'clock with a delicate green-grey hue on our faces, and made haste to the GLASGOW EURO HOSTEL, which promised hotel accommodations at hostel prices.  Boy, were they wrong.  For one thing, we weren't allowed to check in until late in the afternoon, which meant wandering the banks of the River Clyde like zombies for what felt like a month. The next hurdle was the fact that we weren't allowed to sleep in the same room, meaning that I was shoveled into a dorm with about a dozen fourteen-year-old girls who had just landed from Vancouver and were full of, well,  vim . The rooms were drafty and the showers are best not spoken of, but I'll do it anyway: unless you're seven feet tall (and those who love me will know that I fall - heh - short of that mark), you drown in these showers, and then you die. I cannot come up with enough hyperbolic words to encompass the fortitude required to enter one of these death chambers.  It wasn't even  hot  water, really.  Glasgow, I could tell, is a beautiful city, but unfortunately Mike and I viewed it, for the three days we were there, as through a black and white television: I remember no colors whatever. I know that we saw an imposing cathedral, and a couple of universities, and statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert - oh yes, and a KFC too. But I would be lying a big lie if I were to tell you that it wasn't with a smatter of relief that we boarded the bus to Edinburgh on June 18.  I can't say enough about Edinburgh and how it stole my heart: the benches alone enchanted me to the point of wanting to move there. And really, haggis is pretty excellent, although I can't give a corresponding Sarah Approval star to deep-fried Mars bars, which just made me ill.  We did all the lovely ridiculous things in Edinburgh: we went to the Palace of Holyrood (to see, obviously, where David Rizzio got stabbed 57 times); we went on a ghost tour (haw) to meet the Mackenzie Poltergeist and have the Greyfriars Bobby myth debunked; and, with a group of travellers from Iowa, discovered the secret of getting the train from Haymarket to Waverley for free (viz. get on the train, travel from Haymarket to Waverley, and watch while no one gives a shit that you have no ticket).  On the last day we went to Edinburgh Castle, which looked so compelling and ethereal when seen from the Royal Mile at night, and I have to say, the whole experience was like a draftier walk through West Edmonton Mall. Eight quid at the door, three more for an audio guide (shrewd  moi : I got a child's guide - the same thing with smaller headphones - for one pound), four for half a sandwich, two for a can of Diet Coke; and, best of all,  donation boxes  wherever the eye happened to stray.  Once you got past the tragicomedy of the prices, though, it was quite interesting, if only for the view (looking out over the city, I was standing right next to the One O'Clock Gun when it went off) and the window it provides to Scottish military history.  St. Andrews was our last stop before plunging down into England, and this was a Mike thing, as it was clearly the wrong time of year to be Prince William-hunting, and golf doesn't really compel my fascination. However, I did get to pose under a ludicrously funny street sign that read BUTT'S WYND, and that made the journey entirely worthwhile.  England and beyond next time.

						    ... And another, also from Amsterdam, on October 5:   I thought it might be fun to tell you, all my loved ones, about my first European bout of sleeplessness, because it's funny now that it's not happening anymore.  1:30 a.m., the (ugh) "Happy Room" of the Flying Pig Hostel, Amsterdam, where dozens of folk are staring with rapt "attention" at a Depeche Mode concert on TV. Mike leans over to me and says, "I think I'm going to bed." This sounds like a good idea!  And so we go upstairs (the Happy Room is, by happy necessity, deep in the basement, because of the happy smells that come out of it). I've gotten ridiculously good at putting on pajamas without taking off any of my other clothes, so I did that, and then sat down to do my exercises (before, it was 40 situps and 10 pushups, but in Amsterdam I've upped it to 50 and 15 respectively, to make up for pizza consumption).  Those dispatched, and teeth brushed, I began the elaborate witchery involved in putting me to sleep. Lying down, I pushed all of my hair off my neck, selected the chapter of _Barnaby Rudge_ that I wanted to hear that night, put it in my Walkman, arranged my headphones so that they didn't cut uncomfortably into my head, fluffed the pillow under my neck, put a swatch of blanket between my knees, kissed the man I love goodnight, closed my eyes, and hoped for the best.  Ninety minutes later the Dickens prose was still droning in my head and I was no closer to sleep. Three o'clock in the morning now. I got up and walked around. I gave my head a shake. And I went back to bed. People were snoring, you see, and the tape doesn't drown out everything, especially when you're sleeping in a room with forty other people. So I wrapped my fleece jacket around my head and tried again. Nothing. I tried switching around, so I was lying at Mike's feet. That was promising for a few minutes. And then I was wide awake again.  Luckily, this hostel has free Internet access, and of course, at this hour, there was no lineup for the computers. So I went there, and stayed on Messenger for about two hours: company is a good thing when you're supposed to be sleeping and can't. And then it was five in the morning, and I realized that five in the morning is a perfectly respectable time to call friends at home, because it's nine o'clock at night there. And so I ventured to the friendly telephone that has a big Canadian flag on it. Now, usually the conversation goes like this, and makes me wonder why they bother saying that there's a "special Canadian operator":  a. "Please enter your credit card number" (and I punch it in) b. "Please enter the expiry date" (and I punch it in) c. "Please enter your billing zipcode" (now, this I can't do, because unlike the US, which has only numbers in their zipcodes, Canadians have "postal codes", which are a combination of letters and numbers - so I press zero and wait) d. The operator picks up. "Can I have the number you're calling, please?" (and so I give it to her) e. "Now, I just need your billin' zipcode, darlin." (I explain very slowly to this woman from Tennesee that I have a postal code, and spend about fifteen minutes enunciating it to her)  And then my call is in progress! Whoopee! Incidentally, Mike had a bit more trouble making a call in Vienna, and I was standing next to him listening to him read out his credit card number four times, and finally he said "Is MasterCard not MAJOR enough for you?" And then HE got to the postal code part: "T6J 7E8. No, J as in Jason... and E, as in... the fifth bloody letter of the alphabet!" He was pissed off, but it sure was funny to me.  Now for my experience at five in the morning.  "I'm sorry," the woman says. "We aren't recognizing your... postal code." I explained, patiently (I thought, anyway), that I had used the card very recently to telephone my mother in Edmonton, and there was no earthly reason why it shouldn't be recognized now. "I have an idea!" she said. "I'll transfer you to a Canadian operator!" I said that that would be fine.  And then she hung up on me.  So I called back, and got a man this time, and explained to him that I should have been transferred to a Canadian operator, but got disconnected. "Um," he said, "We have no contact with Canada. You can't talk to a Canadian operator." WELL. I asked for the international operator. "That's me," he said, a little too proudly. And you can't contact a Canadian operator? "Um, no," he said. Some kind of international operator, I said, and hung up.  So I couldn't talk to friends. It was now almost six in the morning, and I thought, maybe now, maybe NOW I'll be able to sleep.  The woman in the bed across from Mike and me had the oddest singsong snore I'd ever heard. I performed my whole ritual again, to absolutely no avail. And so at six-thirty I got up again, and signed into Messenger again. My friend Colby, always available to me on Messenger no matter what ungodly hour it is, wrote "Aww jeeeez, it's not YOU again," and talked to me very sportingly for another hour or so.  It's very interesting, I found, to be awake during the night shift at this hostel. I was the only one up, except for the night man at the reception desk (a little Latino with a really interesting knitted beret), who came by my computer and fluffed my hair and said "Not sleeping yet?", which is basically the most asinine question I've ever heard. Satisfied, he walked away. And about forty-five seconds later, Lenny Kravitz came on the stereo. Some wilted ballad that I never liked to begin with, but two things happened to make me like it considerably less:  a. He started singing along. Not just singing, actually: really howling. b. It turned out that he had it on repeat.   So I listened to that for an hour, told Colby that sleeping just HAD to work this time, it being eight in the morning, and went back to bed. Well, now I didn't just have snoring to contend with: there was light, too, coming in from the window. When I got into bed Mike lifted his head and looked at me. "Still not sleeping, sweetie?" I confirmed this. "Oh, sweetie, I love you sooooo mmmuuuucchhhh..." he said, and then his head dropped down and he was out again.  A little before nine I gave up and came back out. Colby started yelling at me to just kick everyone out of the room, because THEY'D had enough sleep now, and it was my turn. Being the person I am (which I sometimes regret), I didn't do this. But breakfast at the hostel ended at ten-thirty, so I figured that some money-and-food-conscious people would be up before then, and decided to wait it out.  This wound up being the best course. At ten, Mike got up, looked at me, and said, "Don't tell me," and promptly tucked me into bed, stuffed earplugs in my ears, gave me a hug and a kiss, ran down to breakfast, and then ran back up and watched over me to make sure that no one tried to kick me out of bed - which, as it turned out, was exactly what happened. He explained to the staffer who was staring at me ominously that yes, we had paid for a couple more nights, and I was completely entitled to be sleeping at that hour. She was convinced that we were supposed to be checked out, and reached down to nudge me, when Mike said, "Don't TOUCH her!" Finally, she left.  And I slept through all of it.  Anyway, that's my (much longer than I intended) story: sorry if it put you to sleep (HAW). Would that everyone were so well cared for during a bout of insomnia.  More soon.  Love, S.

						   Getting back to my trip play-by-play, here's another email I sent out, this one on October 2.   Mike and I took left Vienna three nights ago, taking another night train, although this one was slightly more comfortable than trying to make camp in the bicycle compartment: we got a room with bunks - very classy - as a gift from Mike's mother for his birthday. Imagine! Even the medicine cabinet was full of goodies. So we passed a very posh seventeen-odd hours before arriving in Amsterdam at about one in the afternoon.  I can't believe I'm writing this, but we're staying at a hostel called (ugh) "The Flying Pig," and worse yet, it was MY idea, because if two people share a queen-sized dorm bed, it's cheaper than anywhere else in the city. Little did I know.  This place is every Burnaby-retardo's dream: there are no non-smoking rooms (and by smoking in Amsterdam...); they politely ask you not to fire up around the reception area before five in the afternoon, but nobody really listens, not because they're rude or malicious, but because they've lost all concept of time.   And in this atmosphere, SHOULD you place three computers with Internet access on desks next to the "Chill Area" with signs saying "Free for Twenty Minutes" and place these people on the honor system? Ah, but that's what they've done. As if they understand what "minutes" are anymore anyway. Waiting for the computer, I cannot tell you how many times I've seen people writing to their friends,"I been fried for 12hours now...this place is sooooooooo awesome..i'm totaly bringing pam here for her bday." Oh, for the fledgling patriot in me: most of these people are Canadian.  And for the other side of Amsterdam: the prostitutes, with a few exceptions, seem to be young and healthy, and the shops are classy, and nobody bothers you - except on the street. I thought that this city was a bastion of free love and tolerance, and that men could get whatever they wanted on the other side of the canal, but now I learn that it's no different from King's Cross or 97th Street: I can't go out without Mike, unless I want to get mauled. So I've been a good girl.   I suppose that's the sum total of my observations. Tomorrow we take a day trip to The Hague, which should provide a different... vibe.  Till next time, if God wills it, etc.  Love, S.

						   Well, the time has come, the walrus said, for me to talk about the weather.  In December I was in Spain, where the Spanish are complaining of a frigid winter, and where I went walking barefoot with the man I love on a beach, at night, in Alicante. It was December, and it was over twenty degrees Celsius.  And then I came  here .  Now sure, Canada's winters tend to be cold, and logically, the further north you go, the worse it is. Edmonton's pretty far north, and it's also far inland, so it's very dry. So yeah, winters are cold. But if you have a decent coat, it shouldn't bother you too much, because it's not like Edmonton's never seen a bad winter before! We're prepared, with braziers and pedways and nine thousand different forms of climate control! Smart Canadians!  Here, let me give you an example: I live on campus at the University of Alberta, and so my world is a small bubble; I have everything I need within walking distance. The building I work in is called the Henry Marshall Tory Building, and it's about fifteen minutes from home to get there on foot. Would you like to take a stab at how many of those fifteen minutes I spend outside? I'll give you a hint: it's three.   You see, between my apartment building and the Tory building are the Timms Centre for the Arts , the Fine Arts Building, and a long, narrow building called HUB, which is both a shopping centre and a simulacrum. All of these buildings are connected together, on their second floors, by pedways. So all I really have to do is cross the street to the Timms, go inside, and get on the second floor, and I needn't go outside again for more than eight hours. Unless, of course, I need a cigarette, but that's a story for another day.  I am a Canadian, and I am proud of this system. No wimpy London or Vancouver temper tantrums for us! No indoor recess, no snow days, none of that pussy shit. The view from my bedroom window during the average Edmonton winter looks something like the screen of a black and white television with bad reception, but no matter: you go out, and you have your bloody day. We're made of tough stuff.  But these days, I'm telling you. It's not just because I recently came from Spain: check  urlLink this  out. And you know what? That's a five-day high. Earlier this week, it was -34 in the sunlight. If you scroll down you'll see that there's a difference between the actual temperature and "what it feels like". At press time, it's actually -26 Celsius, but it feels like -42 owing to the wind. Balmy, compared to the past week.  No matter what you think about Canadians, no one is enjoying this. We are prepared to deal with all manner of malevolent weather, but this? Now the inside of HUB Mall (see above) probably actually feels colder than walking outside in downtown London. And I'm finished with it, and here's why: because I spent eight months of my life going from country to country telling people not to believe everything they hear about Canada - about us in igloos, and flannel jackets, and this bloody cold weather - for an Edmonton winter, think New York City. Usually.  And then I get back here to this weather, and snow everywhere, and traffic at a standstill, and for the first time in my life I heard the word "hoser" used in a conversation completely free of irony. Canada has disappointed me, and I'm thinking seriously of relocating.  The worst of it is that Mike, the beat of my heart, is in Tunisia. At this rate, he'll just never come home.

						   For some reason passing understanding, I am on a mailing list,  via  my Hotmail, called "ElizabethI", catering to natterers, role players, and fans of  urlLink Cate Blanchett . I wouldn't, of course, call myself a serious historian - I'm very rarely a serious anything - but I'm a little more serious than  this  group of people.  I won't quote from the emails that folks have sent out to the list, but I will say that this morning, for probably the fiftieth time, this question appeared in my Inbox: "Do you think Elizabeth was really a VIRGIN? cause I don't think so. Ithink about what she was like, you know and I just think no way, man. Think about her  personality , man."  Number one, this is no longer a question of interest to me. Such a small technical detail shouldn't really be of interest to anyone. Why anyone would even entertain such a question is beyond me - although even if there are a  few  people in the world who will pass up the opportunity to talk about sex, there isn't a single one of us who would pass up the opportunity to look clever at someone else's expense.  The more important issue, though, is that there's no reason to suggest that Elizabeth's virginity should even  be  a controversy. Apart from the whackjobs who think that she was Francis Bacon's mother, can anyone come up with any evidence to suggest that she  wasn't  a virgin? Apart from a twenty-first century incredulity that such a thing is possible?  Considering her "personality" is a dangerous exercise; and, in fact, if one were to do such a thing, one would find that a) she was, in most practical matters, eminently sensible - whether it seemed so or not; and b) she had a horror of total commitment to  anything , be it marriage, war, religion, or the law. There is a technical term for it: "masterly inactivity." Elizabeth's sins were all sins of omission: without fail, she erred on the side of  not  doing something.  Now to my mind, a cooler question  would be Did Elizabeth I masturbate?  Well, maybe not so cool, because I'll bet she didn't. But it's a more plausible idea than imagining her dragging Kit Hatton into closets and having her wicked way with him. No matter whose power was the greater, it was always the woman who paid the price. So enough of this nonsense. Consider me unsubscribed.  Of course everyone has his pet theory about her sex life, and why did never married. Mine is completely tied up in Tom Seymour.

						    urlLink Michael Williams  seems to think that he's  urlLink done the world a great service  by alerting it to which links on Glenn Reynolds's  urlLink InstaPundit  have died in the last six months or so.  I'd like to say for the record that sitting in that Internet cafe in Cambridge, slowly typing out "SUSPENDED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE", caused me great pain, and I am entirely at fault. But I'm back now!  So, Glenn, if you're out there, your nod in my direction meant a lot to me. I don't have a SiteMeter anymore, which I almost prefer, because it halts the urge to fill my posts with things like WINONA RYDER and BIG TITS HERE simply in order to get hits. But I was always proud that InstaPundit had linked to me, and I'd like to be proud again.

						   There I was, flitting around on the web looking for myself, when I realized that I've been  urlLink added  to BlogsCanada (see link, to the right). Not only that, but I've got a little thumbs-up sign next to my name, which means that you're making a worthwhile investment in, well, not paying to see my site.  And then I realized that I'm completely marooned on this site - writing, for all I know, solely for my own sense of fun and adventure. Not only did I lose my SiteMeter in the Big Crash, but I also lost the mailto: function - and so I re-established it. So now you can write to me if you feel so inclined; and please do, because it would be nice to hear more than my own echo around here.

						    APRIL 20, 2050   This date is significant because apparently it's the day I'm going to die.  urlLink Discover your death date!  Have fun!  Actually, Colby should enjoy this one, not only because he's literally invested in the date of his own death, but because "Do you smoke?" is not a question that features anywhere on this quiz.

						    SARAH, ACCORDING TO...   This morning I idly took a  urlLink quiz  to find out what kind of "personality type" I am, and here's the result:   Like just 8% of the population you are a MASTERMIND (Submissive Introvert Abstract Thinker). You can be silent and withdrawn, but behind your reserved exterior lies an active mind that allows you to analyze situations and come up with creative, unexpected solutions. Normal people call this "scheming." Don't learn German.   Anyway, your sense of style and originality are your strengths, and people will respect your judgment once they get to know you. If you learn to be a little more personable, you could be a great leader--you've definitely got the "vision" thing down. Just make sure all the plotting you do behind those eyes of yours is healthy.   Famous masterminds in television: Dr. Claw, The Scarecrow and Mrs. King, Montgomery Burns.   Well, the only question that would give a clue to my being "withdrawn" was the one about whether or not I chat up cute waiters (I do not!). And there was another question, this one about a sentence in which a passive pronoun had been mistakenly put in the place of an active one, asking, "Did you notice the grammatical error?" Well,  what are you going to say?  "No, I didn't notice that, because not only am I a big doofus, but I want to be  seen  as one as well."  In any case, I was hunting around for a decent survey that would constitute some part of the autobiographical component of this page, and I'm still looking. Most of them devolve into questions like "Do you prefer chips or popcorn at the movies?" Good luck to me.

						    TRUE LOVE LEAVES NO TRACES   Sparring has erupted over the marital status - or statuses, or stasis - of Henry VIII: first, listen to  urlLink Gregg Easterbrook :   God's Bestseller reminds us of what a twit Henry VIII was. I chortle each time today's conservative Anglicans or Episcopalians complain that gay union would trample "traditional" marriage. Their denominations were, after all, founded by a man who divorced five women, beheading some for amusement.     Wrong , as  urlLink Colby Cosh  points out:   Well, we can tell Easterbrook's college degree isn't in history, anyway. Details are always a bit tricky, but technically the number of women Henry VIII divorced would be more like, um, one--that being the first of the six wives, Catherine of Aragon. His marriage with Wife #2, Anne Boleyn, was declared invalid by the new English church at his instigation. You could call that a "divorce", I suppose--but the term certainly isn't applicable to Jane Seymour, who died as consort, or to Anne of Cleves, the "Flanders mare" with whom Henry never consummated marriage. Catherine Howard was executed, which I wouldn't really call a "divorce" either.   But strangely enough, Colby is sort of wrong too. When he says that Anne Boleyn's marriage was "declared invalid" by the "new English church," he doesn't seem to realize that the process by which it was declared invalid was the exact same one that denounced his union with Catherine of Aragon: both unions were invalidated, by the same institution, on grounds of consanguinity.   Henry VIII himself claimed, while he was married to Katherine Parr, that he had  never  been divorced, and technically, he's right. Divorce and annulment are very different things, and a large part of the reason that Catherine of Aragon fought so hard against the end of her marriage was the position of Henry VIII that it should never have happened: only annulment from her could secure the illegitimacy of her daughter Mary. By the time of Jane Seymour's death, Mary and Elizabeth had the same status. The English church also annulled his marriage to Anne of Cleves on the grounds, as Colby says, of non-consummation; so it could be said that Catherine, Anne #1 and Anne #2 all shared the same legal status in the end.  Finally, it's also worth pointing out to Gregg Easterbrook that Henry VIII, however technically, was always on solid legal ground with regards to his view of his own marriages. He made sure he was: his conscience was a delicate, fickle thing, and seemed to follow his own desires, but that coincidence - although noted by everyone save Henry himself - doesn't mean that his conscience didn't exist. It was a lively and integral part of his marital adventures.

						    SEPTEMBER 2003   The following is an email I sent from a cafe in Vienna on September 24, 2003. It will serve just as well to let you know all about the days of true love and high adventure that followed the workcamp.   Subject:  And I´ll dance with you in Vienna...   ... because that´s where I am.  This is just an update, and it won´t necessarily be an interesting one, and you might even be wondering why I´m bothering with the ole updates now when I didn´t do it for so long.  I really dunno. Maybe because I´m not in an English-speaking country anymore, and I´m feeling very far from home and desperate to communicate with anyone who speaks my language (although English is shamefully prominent in Austria, it seems). Anyway.  Mike and I arrived in Vienna at the stroke of midnight two nights ago, not having slept properly for, well, a long time. After the camp in Kreinitz ended, we took a train to Leipzig with two of our campmates, and at ten at night left one of them to her own devices and climbed on a night train to Munich. We slept - or tried to! - in the part of one of the carriages that usually keeps bicycles, and it was freezing cold, although Mike had his sleeping bag and I had a hostel sheet and his capital-I Industrial MEC raincoat.  We got to Munich at six in the morning with the intention of going straight to Oktoberfest, getting several pictures of the same liter of beer to make it look like we were as good at drinking as the Bavarians, and then going to Vienna. We started by napping in the Munich train station for about ninety minutes, leaning up against each other on a bench on the very platform we alighted at.  The Germans I´ve met seem to be ashamed of Bavaria: the closest analogy I can come up with is visiting Canada by only going to Nunavut. All the stereotypes are reinforced (with no offense meant to Nunavut, natch). Well, Oktoberfest confirmed this: lederhosen, dancing girls with wreaths and tight corsets, and, well, beer. We got there, shot back our liter of beer and our requisite plate of  wurst mit kraut , and left again. Which isn´t to say it was necessarily bad, but neither of us is a beer-drinker, and even if we had been, the one liter we got cost a princely sum; and, having neither eaten nor slept properly, we had a fair bit of trouble finding our way out of the tent afterwards. On the up side, the sun was, I think, shining directly on me, and now, whether you believe it or not, I have a  bona fide  tan.  When we arrived in Vienna, we abruptly realized that we had no place to stay. We decided that I would wait with the luggage while Mike trolled around, and that wound up being a mistake, albeit a harmless one. I don´t think I´ve given away more cigarettes in a single half-hour before, but the people who took them from me were exceedingly polite: one even kissed my hand. All the while I was standing with our packs trying not to look at the man who was unloading enormous crates of pornography about three feet from me.  With his usual success Mike had hooked us up in a charming hostel, which has been recently converted and is, technically, the oldest standing hotel in Vienna. Because the Zeithain camp only provided cots, this was the first time in more than two weeks that Mike and I had actually slept on linen, with pillows, so it was a good night.  You don´t really have to know what to do in Vienna. Every time you open your eyes you see something fascinating, so the next day Mike and I just wandered around, eating buns with jam from the hostel breakfast, and looked at things. We found the Danube (admittedly not difficult, but it was GREEN, thanks very much), some Roman walls, and the Building of Fun (!!) with seven floors of retail madness, among much else.  That night we watched  Jackass  in German, which was fantastic, and went to bed early (well, one in the morning, which is early to us) after having attempted to call our respective mothers (don´t worry - we´ll be trying again tonight, with any luck - the phones here are weirdy).  Today I spent my first several hours in Vienna by myself, which got off to a good start, but within half an hour I had to get myself a map, for whose price I could have gotten a small car. And now I´m sitting in this Internet cafe wondering just HOW I´m going to get back to the hostel without Mike. But I´m strong and independent, blah blah, so I´m sure I´ll get there before, well, tomorrow.  I miss you all desperately, of course, and would love to hear from you. Hope you´re all doing well.  Love, S.

						    GERMANY, CONTINUED   Where  was  I? This temping thing is so ridiculous - I never know if I'm going to be working, or if I'm just a warm body. I was meant for better things than this. But things have settled down a little and I'm at my  alma mater 's department of Anthropology for the forseeable future, and a lovely, bumptious place it is.  Anyway. Germany.  There were twenty-two of us at the camp, which was English-speaking, and Mike and I were two of only three native English speakers - the other, Simone, being from England. You wouldn't have known it, though (that there weren't many native English speakers, not that Simone was from England. She sounded very English): there are so many  borders  in Europe that the calibre of the average European human being is just, well, much higher than that of our cookie-cutter, white-bread North American breed (with no offense meant to myself or anyone else). English was often a third or even fourth language for my fellow campers, and we still managed to discuss the state of the world with absolutely no trouble, and they didn't even flounder in my ridiculously idiomatic way of speaking.  What I'm trying to say is that I spent a goodly portion of these two weeks feeling like a complete dunce. And, far from learning new languages - or at least half a dozen words in German - my English actually started to fall off. I forgot words, conjugated verbs wrong, ostentatiously used semicolons where an ordinary comma would do... There really was no end to my idiocy.  What the campers took away of me was this: I am short; I have red hair; I smoke menthol cigarettes (for which I was mercilessly mocked, until a cold started going around, at which point even the most diehard F6 smoker turned into Pansy Paranoia and started stealing my minties); and I drink lots of Diet Coke.  Or I  would  have done, if it had been at all possible. The village of Kreinitz, whose population, I think, was trebled during the time that SCI was there, has four cigarette machines within its two-odd blocks, but not a single vending machine or corner store. I actually went for one full week without a single drop of Diet Coke passing my lips - and even when we got into Dresden for a day trip, there was no Diet Coke to be had. Continental Europe doesn't sell Diet Coke, I find, except in Gibraltar. Did you know that? No, what they sell is called Coca-Cola Light, or euphemistically, "Coke Light", and it's a sort of mangled hybrid of Diet Coke and regular Coke and Pepsi Max (remember Pepsi Max?). It doesn't precisely taste like garbage - in fact, it was very tolerable when I finally got some - but partaking at home (or even in England) made me realize immediately what I was missing.  Which brings me to the relevance of my last entry's title: the sum total of my German. It means "Coke Light, with ice, please", and I got to practice it in front of a breathless audience at a pizza place (we went for pizza! In Germany!) which, it turned out, did not sell Coke Light. I practiced saying that for so long! Only to be flatly rejected, and not even  know  it until my table mate, Rolf, told me that what I took as "Would you like a small or a large? And, by the way, congratulations on learning a sentence in German!" was, in fact, "We have nothing for you on this continent."   I got water, and paid through the nose for it.  But the company more than made up for it (and I did return to Kreinitz from Dresden that day with about eighteen litres of Coke Light in my pack). Despite a conspicuous lack of Australians or Americans, this was a very diverse group: Belgium, Germany, France, England, Switzerland, Finland, South Africa, Thailand, Russia, the Netherlands, Guatamala, Nicaragua, India, and Poland (I certainly can't remember all of them, but that wasn't it) were all represented, as I said, in picture-perfect English. And while uncovering the former Soviet POW latrines and oven doors was crucial to this particular fortnight, and fascinating as well, I don't believe that many of us considered it the overarching focal point of the camp.  For one thing, there was beer, cheap beer, and lots of it. So those who enjoy beer were slightly impaired most evenings, but not in the North American, puke-on-your-sister kind of way. This was the sort of inebriation that inspired and encouraged lively conversation, and was one of many factors that conspired to make the twenty-two of us very close for the time we were together. International understanding indeed! In political debate Mike represented the token American and, while he was occasionally made to sit in a corner by himself owing to his conservative views, he was listened to, and understood, and not shouted down. He was able to convince people that he was right (and not just  right  - haw), and he was also converted to some of the views of others (those of you who know Mike will know how jaw-dropping this is).  And get this: they wanted to know about Canada! This was maybe the first time I'd realized what a massive, beautiful country I was born in: did you know, for example, that Swiss farmers dream about buying land in  Saskatchewan ? Poor, trod-upon Saskatchewan, that no-man's-land of wheat pools through which, from Alberta, you can actually see Manitoba. This is paradise for someone! For  many  people! In so many ways, it was only by leaving my country that I learned to begin loving it.  I won't lie to you: staying at this camp, and not turning tail for home as I wanted to dozens of times, was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It was absolutely terrifying to live with these new people, to be unsure of what was expected of me, to bike ten kilometres a day to the excavation site - none of these things were easy for someone like me. But now I can sit at this desk, with a view of the frozen North Saskatchewan river, and think about what I did during that workcamp. I have new friends; I'm closer to the man I love; I have a greater understanding not only of a different part of the world, but of my own part.  Besides which, now twenty more people know ALL the words of the Canadian national anthem. Not to mention the University of Alberta Cheer Song.

						   Is it too late to write a review of a movie that was released six years ago? Fair enough, then: I'll write a review of a review.  Everyone who's opened a sixth-grade history textbook knows that Shekhar Kapur's  Elizabeth  is bullshit from beginning to end. And I say that not because it's wrong  per se , but because the story they concocted to replace what actually happened between 1554 and 1564 is so ridiculous. Truth may not be stranger than fiction, but it sure makes a better movie.  But the worst that reviewers seem to be able to come up with is that it's "confusing" as a film. Even those who give it a bad review take what is warped into the film as writ from the point of view of English history. The particular bone I have to pick, however, is with Roger Ebert, who gave it 3.5 stars in the  Chigaco Sun-Times .  The man should  know  better!  All right, so perhaps most people don't know that the title of 1st Baron Burghley was most emphatically  not  a consolation prize for William Cecil's forced retirement (he continued to serve her for twenty-eight years following his promotion to the peerage, to his death at age 78), although positing that the scene was "truly touching" is almost beyond belief. And maybe he didn't know that Francis Walsingham was almost unknown to Elizabeth before he witnessed the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in Paris in 1572 as England's ambassador to that country, and that if he ever truly did win her confidence, it wasn't until after that point, thirteen years after she was crowned (he was approximately her age and far more a babe in the woods than she was).  But here's how Ebert chooses to close off the review:   At the end of the film, Elizabeth announces, "I have become a virgin.'' And so she remained, ruling over and in some sense creating the England that gave us Shakespeare. Think what a play he might have written about her, if commoners had been allowed to create characters out of reigning monarchs. No doubt he retired in sheer frustration.   Hem. For one thing, there is a common misconception that Elizabeth was some sort of patron of the arts, when in truth she was far more the friend of the bureaucrat than of the playwright. You may or may not know that James I (1603-1625) saw more plays at Court during the first year of his reign than Elizabeth saw in the last thirty of hers. Which brings me to my second point: half of Shakespeare's career - and the most glorious part of it - took place after Elizabeth died. He himself did not die until 1616 , and here's a list of what he managed to accomplish after 1603:   Hamlet Troilus & Cressida Alls Well That Ends Well Measure for Measure Othello King Lear Macbeth Antony and Clepatra Coriolanus Timon of Athens Pericles Prince of Tyre Cymbeline The Winter's Tale The Tempest Henry VIII The Two Noble Kinsmen Cardenio   So "[retiring] in sheer frustration" wasn't really in the cards.  This just makes me crazy. When I was in undergraduate school, I used to write these lovely flowing pieces of prose, only to have them returned by my professors with blood-red marker underlining passage after passage and scrawling the same word over and over: "SOURCE?" If a twenty-year-old pipsqueak who doesn't know her arse from her elbow and really isn't hurting anyone is subject to such punishment, why not Roger Ebert? Do a Google search! Getting basic facts isn't rocket surgery, after all.

						   I have a friend who keeps me in quizzes: every day, there are about five new ones that I can take to find out whether or not I'm a ho, which character from  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  I am, &c.  Today's was  urlLink Are You A Geek?  or something like that, and here's what they had to say about me:   You are 43% geek.   You are a geek liaison, which means you go both ways. You can hang out with normal people or you can hang out with geeks which means you often have geeks as friends and/or have a job where you have to mediate between geeks and normal people. This is an important role and one of which you should be proud. In fact, you can make a good deal of money as a translator.     Normal : Tell our geek we need him to work this weekend.   You [to Geek] : We need more than that, Scotty. You'll have to stay until you can squeeze more outta them engines!   Geek [to You] : I'm givin' her all she's got, Captain, but we need more dilithium crystals!   You [to Normal] : He wants to know if he gets overtime.   Well. Hm. I don't like  Star Trek  or programming software, but I do like books, and that's what landed me at forty-three per cent, I imagine. Oh, and that they asked me how many They Might Be Giants CDs I owned. Not fair at all.

						   I've been rightly alerted to the fact that I acted very crassly and outside all accuracy by writing the post entitled  Belting Chastity  (January 27, 2004). Far from speaking only about Elizabeth's virginity or lack, I falsely levelled that the people on the mentioned mailing list were frivolous and, well, didn't know what they were talking about.  This was patently unfair of me, and insulting to boot: I was going for a cheap laugh and got it all wrong. In my defense, I wrote the post only when the question of Elizabeth's virginity had been posed, and before I had read the entire discussion.  I want to apologize to anyone who is a member of this list who may have strayed to my site: lively curiosity should never be frowned upon, and it's marvellous that there are people who understand that sex and scandal did in fact happen before the turn of the twentieth century.  So consider my head down in shame. If anyone wants me, I'll be the one standing in a corner wearing an "I'M WITH STUPID" t-shirt with the arrow pointing up.

						   All right, enough angst. About work, school and destiny, in any case.  Two months ago I went on A Diet - my first. I've spent most of my adult life hemming and hawing about my weight, but I'd never actually been On A Diet, which is strange, given the awesome statistic that since the age of seventeen I've gone from one hundred to one hundred sixty-five pounds - believe it - and countless variations of In Between.  So I move into this snazzy new apartment with more floor space than God needs and, of all things, a gym with cable TV in the basement (this is the beginning of January). I explored the fitness facilities with all the gusto of a lemming peeking over a chasm, and invariably returned upstairs after fifteen minutes of faffing on the Calories Goal Treadmill (and by faffing I mean faffing: stopping and starting and giving myself awful shin splints).  But bit by bit it got easier, and by mid-February I was going five times a week and staying for about ninety minutes - the catalyst being the television. Altogether I've lost about fifteen pounds, and it would have been more had I mastered the Food Thing (I always assumed that you didn't have to diet  and  exercise - if you did one intensely enough you would net the same results.  Wrong ). But the Food Thing, I'm telling you, is harder to master because of its daily variations - anyone can get it up enough to exercise while watching  Law & Order  or  Jeopardy!,  but it takes some awesome knowledge to be able to eat well every day.  And you know why? Because the rules have changed, are constantly changing. I got a call from a friend the other day telling me that now,  potatoes and carrots are worse for you than ice cream . Why? Because of a thingummy called the "glycemic index", which is assigned to every food to gauge how hungry you'll feel - and how frequently - following having consumed it. Glycemic index. Huh.  As if all this protein v. carbohydrates bullshit weren't enough. There's actually a Lo-Carb Cafe on the coolest street in the city here, which I find vomit-worthy (another simple, efficient way to lose weight, incidentally). In much the same way that Naomi used to ask me - vainly -  What   is   globalization?  I ask the world exactly what a carbohydrate is, what the difference between a simple one and a complex one is. I'm sure this is a very rudimentary concept that everyone on the planet has gathered up and digested - as it were - except me, but  still .   I have been taught by very sane people that if you burn more calories than you consume, you lose weight. But you know what? I think this protein/carb/glycemic index thing is  fucking  with me. I feel so guilty whenever I have a piece of bread now that my stomach starts to bulge out grotesquely, and I might as well have eaten nine chocolate bars for all the bloody virtue I feel. From what I understand of what carbs are, they are my very best friends: potatoes, bread and pasta, oh  yes . They are absolutely my favorite foods. And Dr. Atkins is telling me that instead of a carrot stick or a granola bar as a snack, I should have a  chicken leg?  Does anyone bring cooked chicken to work? Should they?  So I'm having a bit of trouble handling this. Nothing is safe anymore, depending on what you read, so I've cut my reading right off because without fail, it makes me order pizza. Mmmm. The only book I read now is called  The Lazy Girl's Guide To A Fabulous Body , by the English freelancer  urlLink Anita Naik . The book actually tells me how many calories are in paneer, and never once is there any mention of protein. And it makes me happy; and I have obliques now, to boot! A couple of months ago I had no idea what those were, let alone that they were hiding under my flab somewhere. And I have made no carb compromises, and I don't bloody intend to.  Which isn't to say that I won't feel guilty about my moral stance. Just not guilty enough to be bothered.

						   ... well, more like midlife or two-thirds-life for me, given that I'm committing suicide  very  slowly...  Generally age doesn't matter that much to me: all of my friends freaked out when they turned those milestone ages like twenty and twenty-five, and I know that my mother had a friend who spent her entire thirtieth birthday in the shower sobbing. I've never entirely understood this: an age is an age is an age, and if you're on the right path it shouldn't matter how old you are.  But of course it does. Hair greys and boobs sag and, well,  things  don't perform the way they should - but none of us in our twenties should be feeling any of those particular creaks and croaks yet.  When I turned twenty-five last November, I was in Paris: it was a beautiful day in a beautiful city. And the Day After - November 13 - my mind took an involuntary inventory of My Life As It Stands (or as it stood, at that moment):  I am living on scholarship money that's about to run out.  I have no job.  I have no home.  I'm not going back to school.  I can't really hear out of my right ear.  It could be, really, that the Governor-General  isn't  actually going to show up at my door in a limousine, telling me that the Canadian government has decided to put me up in a nice apartment to churn out novels for the rest of my life.   Ergo  yes, I  will  have to find a job.  I suppose you might call it the first age crisis I've ever had. I was a designated driver on my eighteenth birthday; this doesn't usually mean that much to me. But twenty-five was a monumental age for me to turn: I felt that for the first time, it was really my responsibility to be Grown Up. And so I gave it a shot, and began to realize all sorts of strange things.  A couple of years ago I started to get used to the fact that it was no longer necessarily strange/foolhardy/suicide for my contemporaries to get married; at twenty-five, I have to come to terms with the fact that it's no longer necessarily strange/foolhardy/suicide for my contemporaries to  have children . Many of my friends' mothers were my age and younger when they popped out their first kids.  I am neither married nor a mother, and happy to be neither. I still make things explode in the kitchen: I'm glad there are no children in the house to walk into my explosions or get stepped on. I'm also relatively glad that there's no husband to embroil in my tax problems. I'm twenty-five and I still haven't remotely got it down: if I pay my rent and my phone bill on time, and show up to work every day, I count that as something that merits congratulations.  Don't quite know where I was going with this, except to say that I've finally realized that my body is in a phase now where it is aging rather than growing, and I find that vaguely alarming, despite the fact that it's been that way for a few years now. It sort of makes me want to listen to "Once in a Lifetime" by Talking Heads over and over again, until I figure out what David Byrne's solution was.  All the same, though (and I'm sorry if this post is turning into the blog version of  Return of the King , with four concluding paragraphs too many), this crisis doesn't stop me feeling lucky to have what I have. Because my Life As It Stood in Paris five months ago is not As It Stands now,  viz .:  No scholarship, but income.  I have a job.  I have a home (with the man I love, to boot).  I'm still not going back to school, but I  am  writing a novel.  My hearing is completely restored (no joke: this happened on a highway in Spain. I was driving and Mike was talking and suddenly BANG! I could hear him perfectly).  Well, no solution yet to the G-G matter. But I'm on it.  I have everything a twenty-five-year-old could possibly want. Now I just hope that in five years, I'll have everything a thirty-year-old could possibly want.  I'm really stopping now.

						   I have a twitch in my eye and I think I may be in serious danger of cardiac arrest.  Stephen Fry once wrote an article called "Sock Fury" for (I believe)  The Telegraph , in which he described his anger at having misplaced one of the socks he intended to wear that day. He explained that he could not imagine feeling a greater sense of anger and injustice than he felt at finding that his sock's errant brother had gone missing; and went on to discuss the relative quality of anger: if he could get so worked up ("I am so angry I can barely go to the lavatory") about one missing sock, from whence would come the outrage at world hunger, civil rights violations, the fate of the earth?  I feel his fury at this moment.  I work on the sixth floor of the Humanities Building at the University of Alberta. I am the front line at the Dean of Arts office, which shares the sixth floor with the Student Programs Office, where all Arts undergraduates go to make inquiries, seek advice, pick up registration materials, and pay their respects. There is one thing - and only one thing - that the Dean of Arts office, on the other hand, does for students, and that is collect applications for a single award whose deadline is in the autumn.  I deflect about a dozen and a half in-person student inquiries a day, and maybe twenty more by phone.  Why don't you put up a sign?  you may ask. Oh-oh-oh. There are signs. One says "Student Inquiries This Way" and another says "ALL STUDENT INQUIRIES THIS WAY". I've even added big, black arrows to my sign sending students towards the Student Programs Office: it's right in front of the elevator, on a huge piece of paper in huge letters. You really can't miss it: in fact, several of my colleagues have  tripped  over it.  And do you know what, reader? There have been students - maybe five of them, but the number grows - who emerge from the elevator, take an assiduous, forty-five-second look at my sign, and  still  come to me. These are the same students who try to unlock the office door during the lunch hour; the same ones who, when I say "If you're a student, you need to go to the Student Programs Office," interrupt me to say "But I just have one quick question."  I wonder - as I've often wondered - how these people get into university in the first place.  But, you know, I'm discovering that I'm on the wrong side of the glass in this university setting. I've gone from being Academic to being Non-Academic - technically, in any case. And academics - being brilliant in their own esoteric ways - are allowed to be collossally stupid in many others: making photocopies; using coffee-makers; and yes, reading signs - and all this because they were never made to learn in the first place. They wander around dottily, finding Truth in every pillar and Wisdom in every plant, because that's what they were put on this earth to do.  And, naturally, the kid in the Airwalks with his ball cap on backwards and the crotch of his pants somewhere around his knees may not be an academic in the true sense; but having paid tuition, he has all the  rights  of an academic:  viz . to be completely dipshitty about directions and reading and that kind of thing. I point these twenty-odd students a day towards the Student Programs Office with unerring good cheer, sometimes wondering even as I'm speaking where that perky voice is coming from.  All the same I want to get a t-shirt that says    I CANNOT HELP YOU    or    THERE IS NOTHING HERE FOR YOU    Because you know what? When I was an Arts undergraduate - as indeed I was, and not that long ago - I was as stupid as they come. I begged for extensions, I killed off all number of fictional relatives, I went to the wrong classrooms and I pissed off the wrong professors. But never once did I think the Dean's office had anything to offer me - except when I applied for (and won, thank you) the award mentioned above.  End of Aside. I see a girl with a ponytail and an Eagle Creek backpack approaching.

						   Funny thing: I remembered this morning that my school days aren't entirely lost to antiquity: in fact, this site was started about halfway through the last semester of my degree. Boy, did I  urlLink complain  a lot: it seems I considered myself very hard-done by at the time.  But I know how much fun I was having, even if it wasn't always easy. What's the point of fun if it's easy? And when's the last time I took a bath in the middle of the night as I did then? "I think I'm just going to take a bath," I would say to Naomi, "to clear my head." This would either work wonders, or within an hour Naomi would be frantically banging on the bathroom door to make sure I hadn't drowned. Good times!  So I must make it clear to my November/December 2002 self that I was having a  blast .  I'm having an OK time now, too: I have a job, which is good because from job springs money; I have a boyfriend who's learning to cook; I'm now exercising five times a week, which is something my November/December 2002 self would  never have predicted; and these days, all the time I spend in front of my computer is dedicated to my writing -  which is what I wanted all along .  I guess I just don't do mornings. Ugh. I'm yawning constantly and just now when someone asked me for something, I genuinely stumbled on the walk to it. It used to be that I could drink all I liked and feel fine the next morning; now I deal with a hangover when the worst thing I had last night was a bowl of bloody cereal. Now I know what Robin Williams was talking about when he complained about aging...  But think about it: twenty-five (which is my age) is halfway to fifty. This might shock the pants off some people -  I'm going to be fifty, like, tomorrow!  But it's not true! My life has been pretty bloody long so far: I can hardly begin to imagine ten years from now, let alone another twenty-five.  I'm really not that old.  So why am I not more  spry?   I guess I'll have to work on that. I'm trying to take up coffee.

						   I'm sorry I haven't been around much lately: I think my life is getting entirely too boring to support a weblog.  I think more credit should be given to recent graduates for actually entering the world - to those of them who do, in any case. I had a professor once who told me that if I were ever accused of being late for work or class or anything else, I should protest that my punctuality instincts were simply early modern: that in my mind, there is no tyranny of the clock. He was a kind man.  Do you think my supervisors at work say this to me? They do not.  I've been the Executive Secretary in the Office of the Dean of Arts for two months now. People tend to laugh when I tell them that I've been working 8:30 to 4:30 -  sometimes later!!  - for  two whole months  now, but they shouldn't: this is strange, mine-ridden new territory for me, and I'm still not used to it. No, what I'm used to is staying up all night writing papers, with Dexedrine for my brain and a fuzzy blanket for my body.   I now live with my friend Naomi, who once came to my place round about midnight a minimum of twice and at times up to five times a week - well, fuck it, during exams she didn't leave, except for coffee - to stay up all night and study with me.  The silence of our study was broken only by Naomi occasionally expotulating "Globalization  doesn't exist!"  or by me reaching for a pen and knocking over my two-litre bottle of Diet Coke (I usually mopped it up with a throw pillow, but when you're a student you don't have to have Nice Habits). Occasionally we would giggle about something - turn on the  urlLink Food Network  and watch  urlLink Martin Yan's Chinatowns  for a few minutes to remind us why we were in school - but mostly there was a comradely quiet hanging over my little living room, both of us sprawled on the floor, Thinking. We spotted each other; we were working towards something; we were healing the world; people saw us as Persons With Potential.  There was - and is, I've no doubt - a network of people somewhat like us. These nights were spiced with an entire cast of characters. My Mike would come in periodically with provisions and shoved us out of our ruts; and there were the nights that we were joined by our best friend Raechel, who made us laugh with her soliloquies and chair-danced at the table to whatever bombilated from her Discman as she filled out index card after index card with her notes. In the attempt to be Responsible we were forced to be honest with ourselves: we worked best at night (perhaps this wasn't true, but we weren't interested getting up in the morning, and as students we could make the choice not to; and besides, we had class and jobs and commuting during the day: there was simply no time for study), and so we looked after each other. And, as I say, very second or third time Naomi and I met, there would be someone else Out There who had a paper due, and who would check in with us periodically: all-nighters were a strange thing - and all-nighters three times a week are stranger still - but Naomi and Sarah could always be counted upon to be awake and call our friends every hour on the hour to make sure they stayed awake, too.  I look back on those nights with tremendous affection because being in school is the most tangible form of  moving towards something  - I imagine that this is why there are so many degree junkies in my generation. It fostered a closeness between Naomi and me that I think could only find its equal between soldiers in a war: we were intelligent people with the backing of our professors; we had grown-ups who thought we could Go Places, and for a few perfectly-rounded semesters, we believed in ourselves and each other. No matter that we showed up for our evening Film class with pansy-coloured circles under our eyes and a slight tremor in our hands - everyone knew that this was because we were Working Hard. And we did get top grades, believe it: we pushed and shoved and shoved and pushed each other until everything we turned in was perfect - perhaps late, but perfect. If Naomi struggled with a paper I would tell her to put "ironic juxtaposition" (a sure-fire winner) into it somewhere; if I was having trouble she would pepper my work with a few more "Indeed"s to add some panache to my sentences. She wrote about the Middle East and I wrote about medieval England, but no matter: the rules remain the same.  And now? What now?  We all have degrees now, me and my friends. And we all want more. I'm a secretary, in the Dean's office, which means that I take calls from and see my old professors with some regularity. When they see me behind my desk for the first time they eye me with something like horror - a look that gives me some satisfaction - and ask me what, in God's name, I'm doing here. I tell them I'm making money. But there is a tremendous divide between Academics and Everyone Else: they're still Thinking, healing the world. I'm answering a telephone for an hourly wage - and yes, there's something noble in that, but it doesn't mean I like it; it doesn't mean I'm resigned to it. And when Naomi and I sometimes - only sometimes - look at each other with the deadened eyes of those who have Entered the Workforce, I remind myself that it won't always be this way. There is always more school.  I will write; my friends in Political Science (and they're all in Political Science - how did that happen?) are going to shape the world in their own image (an image that, almagamating all those friends, would probably be a classy-looking gay man holding an organic sandwich of some description and wearing a tight-fitting t-shirt that says "Shoot the Poor People"). The world will be different because we walked it. It's just a little hard to remember that from my cubicle.

						    urlLink Rum & Monkey  doesn't seem to have any contact information, so here I am.  I just took a quiz (yes, I know) called "Which Genocidal Maniac Are You?" (I'm not going to link to it because I can't be bothered, and also I'm seeing a little red. It's on their main page under "Tests and Widgets"). I answered the questions asked of me in the most retardedly hyberbolic way possible, and guess (just guess) which "genocidal maniac" I wound up being.   Ariel Sharon .  What frightens me is that people believe this: people think he's a tank-happy destructo-fiend with nothing better to do with his time than launch missiles and throw grenades from his back yard. This is exactly the same thinking that put Yitzak Rabin in a corner with Robert Mugabe at Madame Tussaud's.  Christ.  The best part is the disclaimer at the bottom, which tells me not to accuse the creators of the quiz of racism or anti-Semitism. This is not my concern - although Jews around the world are once again living in fear, because the bloody Second World War taught us nothing. My concern is this statement: if the Palestinians stopped blowing up buses in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and restaurants in Haifa, and hotels in Netanya - in short, if the Palestians were to stop killing thousands upon thousands of Israelis, there would be a chance for peace. If Israel stopped retaliating every single time a bus or a restaurant or a hotel got blown up, Israel would  cease to exist . It's that simple. One side wants peace; the other side wants Israel to  not exist .  And meanwhile the socialists are digging out their Che Guevara t-shirts and deciding that if George W. Bush is helping Israel, then Israel must be a terrible, tyrannical, oil-driven cause. This is all the impetus they need to gather outside  urlLink Marks & Spencer  dressed up in IDF uniforms, women on their knees in front of them, blindfolded with guns to their heads. And this is what people think the IDF does. They forget - or never knew to begin with - the most important word in that acronym:  defense . And of course the far left is always associated with cozy, peace-loving causes, and people fail to imagine that what they are advocating is essentially the eradication of the only democracy in that part of the world; and assisting - whether or not they intend to or are conscious of it - an anti-Semitic trend whose long-term implications are terrifying.  The Jewish people have never been instigators: this is why they have been persecuted since time immemorial. Perhaps they should start.

						   On the topic of my life-altering coffee post (see below),  urlLink Colby Cosh  has this to say:   You wrote pretty much your cleverest and most moving weblog post yet, but you just... COULDN'T resist shoveling in a sentimental quote from a pop song at the end. If I were to specify how mortifying the effect is, you would certainly cry, and I'm not nearly intrepid enough to be so cruel.    And you know what? He's completely, utterly right - quoting is one of two aspects of my writing that I have a serious problem with. Sometimes I use quotations to help me flog the Muse, but most of the time, it's because I'm sure that my own prose hasn't driven the point home. I took an intermediate non-fiction prose course a long, long time ago, and recently I found the papers I wrote for it: there is one that is literally half my words, and half  urlLink Morrissey 's. I'm better now than I was then, but I'm not all the way there.   You'd think I would have been cured of it by my history papers, beside whose quotations  urlLink Dr. Lesley Cormack  would furiously scribble "Source?" or sometimes "Source??" and, when I was really awful, " Source??  (please)". I shouldn't say that: Dr. Cormack had a patience with me, back before I knew how to write papers, that was almost Zen-like. It only evaporated on the page, and even then, it was less the words that clued me in and more the shape of them: the comments were best viewed at a distance of three or foor feet. But even that didn't cure me of my love of all things quotable, or my fear that any document with only Sarah Kelly's words on it will be entirely insufficient.  My other problem is endings. I could write a perfect formula for peace in the world and absolute individual happiness, but the ending would be so stridently saccharine that, in the ensuing chaos of toothaches, everyone at the UN would forget the formula itself (hey, maybe this has already happened). I have never, ever written a good ending. Never. Ever. I don't even know how to close this paragraph.  Huh. That seems to have done it.  Anyway, Colby, your point is well taken, and you'll notice, if I haven't completely gummed up the works, that the props from Joni Mitchell's  The Circle Game  are now gone. After all, if I'm going to make a living doing this, I'd better be willing to take eminently sane pointers from someone who actually does make a living at it. I was overdue for an intervention.

						   I don't know how old most women are when they realize, with horror, that they are exactly like their mothers; every day since I was about eight years old, I've been realizing this with an accompanying galaxy of emotions - usually pride and relief. But this morning my apotheosis spun in a direction that I could never have anticipated; indeed, I was sure that in this particular respect, my mother and I would absolutely never collide.  In my entire adult life - a pittance of time to some, an eternity to others - I have never been a coffee-drinker. It was too hot and it tasted like a bizarre combination of tar and brine, and I couldn't imagine why anyone used it to comfort themselves in the morning. Perhaps this is owing to the fact that my mother drinks lukewarm instant coffee with no festive sweets, and my father drinks scalding goo that really needs to be consumed with a spoon. Besides which there had always been a certain essence of my mother when I walked into the kitchen in the morning and saw her vat of Maxwell House instant on the counter with the lid next to it, and invariably, half- and two-thirds-consumed mugs of the stuff dotted like breadcrumbs on the path from the kitchen to her car. The biggest marker, though, was the teaspoon that always lay next to the microwave. This was the spoon that Mom used to stir her coffee; it always had a little pool of the stuff sitting inside it, and left an almost imperceptible stain on the counter. For some reason very little defined my mother's character for me more than this little spoon - it was like the telltale Z left by Zorro; it was my mother saying definitively,  I have been myself here .   So there were two things at work in my reluctance to take up coffee: first, it tasted awful; and second, I think I felt, on some level, that to do so was to steal a little of my Mom's identity from her.  And I existed for years without it. My friends all paraded through Starbucks and the Second Cup absolutely fainting for their sixteen ounces of elixir; I waited outside with my Diet Coke and wondered why so few others had jumped on my train. Diet Coke was the really refreshing thing; the bubbles and the way it made tears come to your eyes if you drank it too fast. There was nothing of that good stuff to coffee; the very idea of warm drinks made me want to fall asleep.  Two things have happened since then.  The first is that I'm not a student anymore; you might think that this might strip me of the need for caffeine, but you'd be wrong: now I have to get up at seven every morning - not a natural leap for me - and be functional straight through to five o'clock. These are essentially my worst hours for productivity and general cheer, and always have been.  The second is that several months ago I decided to become "healthy" -  viz . I challenged myself to give up Diet Coke. I was drinking something approaching six litres a day, exclusive of any other fluid; and while I couldn't feel the effects at the time, my mind was filled with the notion that aspartame was literally eating my bones, so I decided to take up water and green tea instead - which I did very successfully.  But still the problem of getting up in the morning. I elected to  train  myself to drink coffee - just a little, mind you, to give me a kick when I needed it. But none of the toxic black ooze favoured by my parents, oh no; I got light roast with flavour shots and crammed with milk and sugar and all that good stuff. And I came to a conclusion:   Coffee really wakes you up!   Diet Coke was terrible for me owing to the aspartame in it and the sheer volume that I consumed, but I realized, when I was first fueled by coffee, that DC has, really, a negligible amount of caffeine in it. And caffeine was  the thing  - better than bubbles, better even than the crisp cold of the good ole diet soda.  But I continued to be incredibly picky about the process: one cup in the mornings, from Java Jive, a shot of almond, cream and sugar to go with it. This way it had the bite of coffee but not the sting, and remained a festive thing to look forward to.  Invariably my mother found out, and went on a mission to get me to drink it sugar-free - as mothers will (that stuff rots your brain, you know). I was at the family manse one day when she presented me with Folgers Vanilla Roast Instant Coffee; I made my best Calvin-faced-with-supper expression but told her I'd try it. Within hours, it was gathering dust in my kitchen cupboard.  Fast-forward to last night, when I realized that I was smoking my last cigarette. Usually I'm very organized about such things, and there's another pack waiting in the wings, but for some reason this time it had escaped me. I was in my nightie; I was tired; I didn't want to go downstairs to get another pack. And so I said to myself,  Wouldn't it be nice if I went to the store in the morning to get cigarettes and got my coffee  then  instead of getting it after I'd been at work for an hour?  It sounded like an incredibly civilized thing to do, and I resolved to make it my plan.  But within about twenty minutes I'd come across a pack with three cigarettes in it; there was nothing getting me downstairs the next morning before I absolutely had to leave the house. All the same, as I sat in front of my computer attempting to wake up this morning, I felt rather robbed, having broken my civilized plans with myself, and remembered that I had some white hot chocolate in the cupboard; it would do just as well, so I went to go get it. And what should I come across when rummaging through said cupboard but a virgin jar of Folgers Vanilla Roast Instant Coffee? Just the thing - if I dressed it up properly. I remembered how Mom did it: she took a mug and filled it with water, and put it in the microwave for ninety seconds, and then stirred in but one teaspoon of the stuff.  Voila .  I was drinking instant coffee; as if that weren't bad enough.  Twenty minutes later I was flying around the apartment looking for earrings, slapping anti-perspirant on, mentally locating my keys, when I came across two things.  There was a mug on the bathroom counter, complete with lipstick stain, and it was one-third full of instant coffee.  Next to the microwave sat a teaspoon, with a little pool sitting in it, making an imperceptible stain on the counter.  I stared at it, stunned.  Likely anyone except me could have seen it coming, but it blasted me with the full force of a tidal wave and I've been in something of a daze ever since. I suppose you could call it my birthright, another portion of what has been an unfathomably rich inheritance. I don't imagine the Maxwell House vats will be irritating me again anytime soon.

						   I'm not sure I approve of the dominatrix outfit my weatherpixie wears whenever it strays above about seven degrees here. It's interesting to watch, though.  Besides which I look at the little picture and it says there's sun outside. There is, but it's a harsh, unforgiving sun, not at all the playful friendly thing that such a cartoonish depiction might indicate. This is the kind of sun that you essentially have to stand directly beneath to feel any warmth at all: as soon as you venture into shadow of any description, it's freezing again.  Mike and I went to several places in Europe where this was the order of the day: stay out of shadow or you'll freeze to death. This was particularly true in the autumn, when we were in Vienna - people were still determined to remain in their outdoor cafes when the sun was setting on September, but the wind was ferocious and only direct sunlight yielded any warmth. The only day that this wasn't true was the day Mike and I ate our contraband buns with jam sitting in the cobblestone road outside the Building of Fun (!).  The Netherlands stayed inordinately warm the whole time we were there - so much so that there was an enormous carnival in Dam Square in mid-October (the rides looked remarkably like latter-day torture devices, though, and I didn't venture to any of them - it seemed that you paid a certain number of euros to, for example, be dropped off of a spire without a bungee cord or even a length of string). And occasional rainfall was no match for the enormous MEC "rain layer" of legend - a trenchcoat that went to Mike's knees and looked something like a ballgown on me. I tell you, I would always go out of the hostel to fetch the groceries when it rained in Amsterdam - Mike would outfit me in the raincoat and out I would go, feeling rather like God as I walked leisurely through the downpours and hailstorms while people disappeared in droves from the streets, arriving back at the hostel completely dry, in high spirits, and happy to cook supper. Everybody wins!  But Belgium was cold, and the children in Leuven were very badly behaved, as I learned one day trying to read a book at the laundrette (yes, I was doing laundry too). We were in good company, though, visiting one of our friends from the Zeithain workcamp, and were happy to be walked through town to student union bars and "wild" housewarming parties where the hosts wore cravats and served  hors d'oeuvres  and listened to Leonard Cohen (he's everywhere!). Would that "wild" parties around here were similar: whenever I hear that one is on its way I brace myself for the sounds of maiming from the DKE house to waft in through my bedroom window.  Anyhow, this is taking "talking about the weather" to entirely new and unnecessary heights. I hope this chaotic blubbering satisfies your need for Sarahspeak for the next little bit - imagine my happiness when I realized that people actually do have such an itch! I love you all.

						   As you can see, I've added a  urlLink Weatherpixie  to my site, which describes Edmonton At the Moment (I wish I had a coat like that). I'm trying to see if it stays current or not - at the moment my template says it's eight in the morning; and the day is dragging, but not quite  that  badly. In any case I hope you like it, especially if you're not reading from Edmonton or Canada: you can feel superior because it's warmer where you are and  your  weatherpixie doesn't  need  a coat.  I'm also finding that this Comment function is more depressing than anything: on  urlLink livejournal , for example, the communities seem to be close-knit and intent on having conversations through their comments. I'm not terribly interested in that, but feedback is always lovely, and considering the number of people who give me shit for not updating this often enough, I know I have readers. Also the big "0 COMMENTS" sign at the bottom of each entry isn't exactly non-embarrassing.  In any case I do apologize for not updating; I'm going to use the same excuse that I use every time and tell you that my life simply isn't interesting to warrant coming back with any kind of fair frequency.   Although:  Some time in the next few weeks my friend Alexis and I are going to see a psychic. She swears by this woman, and, having called a psychic hotline for five whole minutes two years ago - to the tune of fifty dollars - I will not fraternize with those who throw stones from glass houses. I'm absolutely excited about it. Mike is divided between not wanting me to go to the expense ("... and what if she tells you that there'll be a new love in your life in the coming year?" he asks me) and simultaneous fascination at the thought of plunking a hundred dollars down to listen to a bunch of hocus pocus ("... besides, she might tell you that I'm the best thing that ever happened to you - hey,  I'll  tell you that and only charge you fifty; how's that?"). I, for one, am completely in favour of the mummery; I think maybe I'm ravenous for psychic insight just because it's been a long time since I was last able to sit down for an hour and listen to someone talk about nothing but me.  I'm  terribly  interested in myself.  Other than that there isn't much going on: my story progresses, the weeks wind around themselves, the grass grows and the ice on the N. Saskatchewan melts (this I can see from my office window).  Mike and I continue our talks of moving to London. It's not going to be as hard as we thought, although work permits seem to be a singular bitch for Canadian nationals to negotiate. He's a British citizen so he has no worries, but there are numerous flaming hoops for me to jump through unless we move there as husband and wife, which is unlikely. But jobs are abundant, and flatshares are a lot cheaper than I imagined - although I've been warned a number of times that a lot of them are dives being let by heroin users. Mike and I both attempt to furrow our brows at that, and after five minutes of straining, can only come up with this: "Whatever. It's  London ."  Anyway, we're feeling very "Next year in Jerusalem"-ish at the moment, and it's lovely. I actually spent all of Monday wandering around work with a smile on my face - people are going to think I like my job, if I'm not careful. But daydreaming will get me through this juncture like nothing else. This has been a categorically messy entry, but I'm hard-pressed to care. More soon.

						   Ah,  now  I remember what it was like to be a student. It was a constant state of existence much like this one.  Whoopee for Easter weekend - and I mean that. You've got to have goals, and for this past weekend I did, and, well, I give myself a B+ - I did enough to satisfy myself. One thing I did  not  do was regulate my sleep in any way to make this particular Tuesday easier on me, and I don't regret it, although it meant that last night I did not sleep at all, and now my eyes and throat feel like they're on fire, and I can only concentrate on one thing at a time - usually something about as compelling as the motion of an elastic band as it falls from my desk to the floor.  I feel like Bobby on  King of the Hill  when he tried Ritalin, standing in front of his open refrigerator saying, "Oop, the milk's about to go bad .... ... ... yep, there it goes."  But it's OK. I've probably stayed up all night at least four hundred-odd times in my life, and this one's no different except for the fact that I don't have to think as hard - and I have to be, outwardly, more cheerful. But I'm well put-together, I'm sporting a broad smile that I'm hardly aware of, and there are only... one hundred ... thirty five minutes left in my day. I can do that standing up... er, standing on my head. I might be a little more tired (incapacitated) than I thought.  And you know what? I'd be tired in this office regardless of how much sleep I got last night, and for this small price I afforded myself the singular luxury of sleeping, and sleeping, and sleeping yesterday, including my favourite way of sleeping: lying on the couch and reading a book and falling asleep while doing  that . No offense, Gregory Maguire.  No matter what manner of campaign my subconscious is on to get me to Grow Up, this is a concession that I feel honour-bound to wait till I have children to make. I will sleep in whenever -  whenever  - I get the chance. It's the most marvellous feeling in the world, going to bed and knowing that you won't wake up until you're good and ready. And I got to do that four times in a row in my recent memory. I'm a happy girl.  Must start being ever-so-slightly more worldly-wise in my posts. They're starting to sound like a Bruce Springsteen song, according to that comedian, whoever he was, who claimed that Bruce had become a millionnaire by telling us what he did that day: "Well, I got up this morning, and I put on my shoes, 'cause I didn't want to wear my sneakers..."  Anyhow. Back to real work. Am feeling remarkably chipper; perhaps this is the psychic equivalent of being on barbiturates for three weeks and being fed through a tube.

						   If you're wondering why my posts have been short/erratic lately, it's because all I'm thinking about is food and I find it tough to set aside any room in my brain for Art just at the moment.  Also my roommate left me on Monday, to mine for gold in Yellowknife before taking a life-altering journey to India, so things have been pretty quiet and soggy this week. Mike and I are now On Our Own and the walls seem to have developed an echo. But so far it hasn't been frightening at all, Living With A Boy: he's becoming a wonderful cook and whenver I venture home for lunch, I get a foot rub. Not a bad deal at all.  But I haven't written a word in a week, award-winning-novel-wise, and that worries me a little, given that one of the only upsides of Naomi splitting was that I (well, Mike) transformed her bedroom into an office. So now I have everything I ever wanted, and what am I doing? Reading diet journals written by people who don't know how to use apostrophes. Must summon the Muse for a serious talking-to.  However, today is my last day of work before a four-day weekend, during which time I plan to sort out my clothes, clean my house and write a light opera. I've been looking forward to Easter for months, which is a bit counterintuitive seeing as I was raised Jewish. But you don't see any bloody four-day weekends for Passover, so we all have to make do. Elizabeth I replaced feast days and saints' days with holidays celebrating herself and England, and I'm about half as smart as she was, so there's no reason I can't pretend that this is Sarah Weekend rather than Easter weekend.  Last night I came across one of my favourite Len songs, "Winter Lady," for the first time in a while, and the combination of this job, my writing and all the circumstances of my life lining up perfectly in the direction of my happiness led me to think this:   But why are you so quiet now, standing there in the doorway? You chose your journey long before you came upon this highway   I suppose one of the most terrifying things in the world is knowing with absolute certainty that you have everything you've ever wanted, and not feeling completely fulfilled and happy all the time. But, as Denis Leary says, happiness comes in five-minute bursts: the joint, the snack, the orgasm. It cannot, by necessity, be a constant feeling, because then who would recognize it as happiness? Better to intersperse it with some quality time in the elevator banging my head against the wall.

						   I feel sick. Easter might be the worst time of the year to be any variety of front-desk entity: candies everywhere. Jelly beans and caramel eggs and almond M&Ms, not a week after the Hershey's Kisses ran out (those were great: I don't like them anyway, and I was completely immune to their call). Last week someone brought in toffees, and that was it: I couldn't cope anymore. I had a wonderful sandwich all ready for lunch, but I'm ruined for it now. I won't eat it: there's no room.  I want to go home to the land of elastic waistbands and - yes, I'm sorry - my stationary bike. I'm sure that'll make me feel better, but The Man won't let me loose for another... sixty-six minutes. How appropriate. My stomach feels pregnant with bile. Actually, what I  really  want is to go to one of those spas in France - do they really exist? - where they put you on barbiturates for three weeks and feed you through a tube. You wake up looking ten years younger (OK, maybe I don't want to look fifteen) and you totter out feeling a overpowering sense of well-being and goodwill towards the world.  I have no goodwill in me at the moment. Sixty two minutes now.  Two days ago - for those who are wondering - I decided to uninstall MSN Messenger from this computer. I was looking over my shoulder every thirty seconds even when I wasn't chatting, and I hardly ever did (because I have superiors in this office, if not elsewhere in the world) and I didn't think I'd miss it, but I do: without watching people swish in and swish out - even if I wasn't talking to them - I feel more marooned than ever in this place, and in greater despair of ever leaving for a glamourous life with, well, several homes throughout the world.  So now all I have is my Eudora, work e-mail, which isn't interesting even at the best of times.  I wish I had more interesting things to throw you than complaints about my job. And it's not a complaint about the job as such: the people here are kind and intelligent and I'm grateful daily that I know them; the work itself is fine (fifty-seven minutes now); I love being at the University and next door to a Tudor-Stuart specialist (our illustrious Dean), and my view of the River Valley is incomparable. It's just that at these moments in the day I am filled with the peculiar angst that comes from having a living memory of being a student and the life that such a status necessitated:  viz . I think it's the hours more than anything else that depress me.  Well, there are only  nine  minutes to go now, because I decided that perhaps the day would end faster if I did some real work (it didn't, really, though it probably seems that way to  you ). I am now in a top-secret conspiracy to rid the world of Lotus, and there is once again meaning in my life.  This isn't an odd end at  all .

						   The New York Metro's site has published a brief  urlLink review  of the remake of  urlLink The Lion in Winter , something that longtime readers will recall was one of the first reasons I created this weblog - the terrible, terrible search for this questionable, questionable TV movie.  Well, it was released in the UK back in March, to this-and-that reviews - essentially, classics shouldn't be taken on but the cast doesn't completely embarrass itself. This past Sunday it was released via Showtime in the US, which generally means that it's broadcast simultaneously in Canada. This time? Not on your life. The closest I've been able to come to when I'll get to see it is when it's released on DVD in July.  I find this infuriating - even though I saw the trailer on Hallmark's main site and I'm feeling rather dubious about the whole project.  Anyway, back to the review. The one callout quote in the text was “As historical pageants go,  The Lion in Winter  is less insulting than  Troy .”I thought this meant that they were actually reviewing the film on its merits, rather than its performance as a remake, but this turned out not to be the case: the review actually seems to be comparing James Goldman, who penned  Lion , with, well, Homer. John Leonard calls Homer "the best sportswriter in the old Greek leagues," and seems to think it an affront that  Troy  was made without his consultation.  The review is the first out-and-out bad one that I've been able to find, and ratifies a number of my fears - for example, that Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is wonderful (see  Gormenghast  for proof) but absolutely  wrong  as Philip - and actually brought up some new ones:  viz . I was  told  that the difference in the remake was that they would use Goldman's entire script, uncut, adding perhaps twenty minutes to the performance; I find out now that this isn't the case at all, making the TV movie, as Leonard puts it, altogether unnecessary.  But here's a laugh-out-loud mental picture: in describing the various performances, Leonard has this to say about Patrick Stewart: "a white-bearded Stewart opens up in his full-throttle  Star Trek  Holodeck parallel-universe mode." Heh.   And so the search continues. I doubt I'll be able to find this in Canada before July, except perhaps on some obscure digital cable channel that I have no hope of getting anywhere near. Mike and I have been rumbling back and forth about getting rid of the cable we do have for about two months now, and I told him last night that either I want nothing at all, or a  lot  more. We'll see which side he comes down on.

						   I should apologize for my absence - probably - but I'm not going to. There are two reasons for it, though: the first is that my bloody site has been under construction since what feels like the reign of Henry II, and I ask you if you would work in an office that had no roof and was missing a wall (it's still under construction, by the way - very drafty altogether).  The second reason is that silence begets silence, and the further it got from last Tuesday, the less I wanted to post. I call this mental phenomenon "Extendatron" or, as the Professor would have it, the "Thing-Longer". Posting here became sort of like calling the great-aunt whose birthday I'd missed - the longer I went without doing it, the more thoroughly unpalatable the prospect became.  Luckily, though, I was inspired by the most hysterically funny thing I've read all May - I humbly direct you to  urlLink Four Bad People - A... MANJOURNAL , begun by two men I know and two men I don't. The one in question, Chris Henderson, unwittingly (I assume) wrote this:   Anyway, it took me a long time to realize that the song is about refusing to have wonton sexual relations, and if it took me that long, how long do you think it will take a thirteen year old girl who giggles when she hears the word 'testicles'?    Heh. I've certainly never had  wonton  sexual relations, but maybe I should hear this song ("Don't Tell Me" by Avril Lavigne - I'm probably better off without it).   Anyway, now that I've broken the ice, expect me to be around a little more often. Although this template is infuriating - nothing worse than a site that looks incomplete. Anyone who wants to should feel free to hack into my account and do something with it.

						   This was bummed off of another site, but I find it irresistible:  "Speaking here in my capacity as a polished, sophisticated European, as well, it seems to me the laugh here is on the polished, sophisticated Europeans. They think Americans are fat, vulgar, greedy, stupid, ambitious and ignorant and so on. And they've taken as their own, as their representative American, someone who actually embodies all of those qualities."  -Christopher Hitchens on Michael Moore

						   Wow, I keep thinking that I'm going to go onto a roll of posting, and then it absolutely doesn't happen. Some reasons why, which will also serve as a Life Update:  a) I went to Kentucky for Memorial Day weekend. This was not arbitrary: a big chunk of my family lives there, and yes, I had an ever-so-slight drawl when I returned to Canada that my coworkers were kind enough to point out. Far from finding this hickish, however, I find Southern accents very soothing, and there's a peculiar cachet in being lulled into security by one's own voice.   It was the second anniversary of my grandmother's death, and this woman was one of the singularly extraordinary people of which there is only a handful in the course of one's life, if that. She was kind and loving and everything a grandmother should be, but more than anything she was so (sometimes senselessly)  proud  of me, and everyone else in my family, and it was impossible to feel bad about anything when she was around. Her body aged far too rapidly, and by the time she died at the age of 69 - far, far, far too young - she was in almost constant pain, and she stated at the time that she was ready for Heaven. For me she is the quintessence of all that can be beautiful and uplifting about Christianity, or pure faith of any kind that finds its base in kindness and giving.   She is buried in a family plot outside Louisa, high on a hill overlooking a valley of cows and houses and almost Irish greenery; she is there with her parents and four of her sisters, and her headstone is inlaid with images of hummingbirds and these words:   Clara Louise Bowling July 20, 1932-May 23, 2002 Our Dear Mother   When we arrived at the site it was plain that we had not been the first to visit - flowers and birdhouses in their multitudes already adorned her grave. Later, I learned that her older brother, Commodore Junior or "June" to those who know him - who is 78 now - made a pilgrimage to her grave, up the gravel hill that those in our troupe decided was too steep and muddy to climb.  b) For the week after I returned, I was looking after my boss's children, which let me tell you is a singularly terrifying undertaking. Not only were they children, and my boss's children to boot, but they were bigger than me, and more clever than me, and I pull absolutely no authority as a fake mom. However, I found out that in addition to being monstrously clever they were also startlingly well-behaved, and ultimately I realized that my presence was needed only to ensure that no letterbombs made their way into the house - in which case I don't know what I would have done anyway. I went into the bathroom and by the time I got out the eldest would have supper underway; the dishwasher was unloaded and the cat box cleaned out every day without the slightest prompting from me, and the responsibilities I was given made me feel like an utter dunderhead.  That week - last week - made me very tired, but it was certainly not the fault of the children, who came and went rather like quiet clockwork and gave me virtually no trouble at all, excepting the youngest occasionally flying through the house on his rollerblades. It was the idea of parenting that frightened me, and I told my mother much to her dismay that the entire experience showed me how far indeed I am from becoming a parent myself. Can there be anything more horrifying than the prospect of something emerging from you and then becoming larger than you? I mean, let's look at motherhood in its true colors, without indulging in any of this rose-colored crap. All the same though these kids were models of virtue, while managing to be rather interesting at the same time - the middle child, on my last day there, was attempting to make a cell model out of Chinese food. I can only hope to have such good kids when the time comes that I forget how freaked out I am by the prospect.  c) My job is changing. The woman I'm standing in for has finally made her return, on quarter-time only, so I'm slowly being moved to a middle cubicle with a beautiful view but no tech specs whatever: no computer, no telephone - in fact, the best I'm able to do at the time of going to press is a humidifier that I don't know how to work. "What a golden opportunity, though," my supervisor tells me with wicked glee and a smile that could light the Eiffel Tower, "to get some really good  filing  done!" So now I'm responsible for making the office - and by extension the building - a little lighter. Actually filing is very calming in its way, though I'm grateful for the moment that I'm still only doing it for half-days at a time. The rest of the time I'm here, warding off crazies and generally being charming.  d) In an ongoing attempt to stop my brain turning to mush (see directly above), I've been seeking out contracts with old acquaintances and professors across campus. So far I've picked up two, one in editing and the second in research, and they're keeping me rather busy in the evenings - happy too, though. Nothing like vocation to make you not want to jump off a building and end it all. I'm also continuing with my own writing - which I'm currently seeing through a fuzzy monitor, darkly - and undertaking several projects at once in an effort to neither bore nor disgust myself.  All in all, it's a full life. The federal election maintains a fluttering pulse in the background, and now in our dining room (em, pardon, Mike's "Business Centre") there hangs an enormous sign asking me to vote for Rahim Jaffer. Amid all this, do I have the time or resources to post? Oh, probably. I get the occasional query about what is "up" with this site, and the truth is that entrenched in everything else, most days I just forget. But one person pointed out the site's value as a diary, and that brought me back. We'll see if it happens again.  Till next time, if God wills it, &c.

						   What  does  make a hermit these days? I know people who never leave their homes and still manage to keep in better touch with their friends than I do. On the other hand, I usually only leave the considerable comfort of my own home because I have to work, and this work is in active pursuit of work that  won't  make me leave home to do it.   I believe there are instances wherein the hermit is camouflaged in outdoor business: we leave home because we have to.&nbsp;While I'm at work I don't think much about being home before, say, 3:00, which ushers in the slowest hour of the day, but there's no doubt that I am here because I  must  be for my own livelihood, and had I my choice, I would  not  be here.   And it's not just the work: it's the people too.&nbsp;Hatred is not a hat I wear well, as I've said dozens of times; I don't hate anyone here, and in fact I can't really think of anyone in my life at all to hate. But I feel broad indifference to other people, with perhaps two dozen exceptions on the entire planet, and amongst those two dozen there are maybe four to whom I feel truly close. I am never more at home than when I am alone, in my home office, Mike perhaps down the hall, so that we are close in case we need one another. We understand each other fundamentally in this respect, and doesn't diminish but rather deepens the love we feel for each other.   These thoughts didn't come from nowhere - I happened upon  urlLink this  entry from Terry Teachout's weblog, and it seemed to relate to a couple of people I know before I realized that those people are genuinely more social people than I am, despite living fuller online lives at the occasional expense of face-to-face contact. They see precisely whom they want to, when they want to, whereas the people I see, in ninety per cent of cases, are people I am forced to see. And by the time I get home from work I'm so tired of looking at computers that I've no chance as a fulfilling life out in the e-ether.   Work is giving me serious anxiety this week. There is virtually no one in this office to whom I owe nothing, and so the very sound of footfalls coming towards my desk is raising my heart rate uncomfortably. Perhaps, you say, I should quit dicking around on my website and get some work done. You're absolutely right; and I've gotten more done today than I have this entire week put together. But I cannot bring myself - no matter how many permutations my brain can effect with the logic - to understand the  importance  of what I'm doing, and I'm determined that it is not important, that I'm simply being kept busy. Of course this isn't true, and when I get home from work today I will resolve exactly why it is not true, and then when I arrive here tomorrow I'll forget all over again.   All right. It's enough: seventeen minutes of concentrated work before I'm liberated from this godforsaken place.

						   71. The worst I suffer now is by way of pregnancy scares, and, as anyone who’s had one will know, the premenstrual week has a propensity to ape the initial symptoms of pregnancy within a few degrees of perfection.  72. I hate – I mean I  hate  – the fact that there is no reversible form of male birth control, and I hate what that says about the so-called ‘enlightened’ western world.  73. On top of exotic disorders, I spent most of my childhood wishing that I wore glasses. I would do every conceivable thing to ruin my eyes, and nothing worked. My vision is only now starting to go on me, and even so it’s only to the point that I can’t make out the striations on the leaves of trees a hundred feet away.  74. I have also wished at various points in my life that I were a cow on a dairy farm. I told this to my friend Colby once, and in response he wrote me a note on a napkin: “I wish you would stop wishing that you were a cow, and I also wish you would stop wishing that you wore eyeglasses. Although I must admit it would be pretty fuckin’ funny if you got both wishes.”  75. I love cows. When it’s said in  The Life of Brian  “Blessed are the cheesemakers,” I take the statement at full face value. I think that we could all tear a page out of a cow’s book. I have a very special relationship with them and have done since I was six months old and my mother took me in my pram through a field filled with them – about half a dozen of them came and looked at me with their huge cow eyes, and I looked back, and we remained frozen thus for several moments.  76. Several men have expressed some degree of interest in marrying me, but I have never gotten a formal marriage proposal, nor have I given one.  77. I invariably look better in the morning (not first thing, mind you, but before noon) than I do at any other point in the day.  78. For someone who goes on as much as I do about living a life of the mind, I sure play a lot of video games.  79. I have eighteen six-hour videotapes of  Law &amp; Order  episodes. They have all recently crapped out on me.  80. My TV/VCR has also recently crapped out on me.

						   61. I think the female form is far more interesting than the male, and has more of a capacity to be beautiful.  62. I get bored very easily. I can’t walk to the bathroom without having something to read.  63. Both of my parents are American – both born and raised in Ohio, the southern part. I now have family in Ohio, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee, and those are only the ones I can think of at the moment. Whenever I go down there, even if it’s just for a couple of days, a drawl attaches itself to me. When I come back to Edmonton people make merciless fun of me for the way I talk, but it slides right off me. Of all accents in the world I find the Southern one the most soothing and wonderful to listen to – followed closely by the Newfie one.  64. I have been defeated by Nature one too many times, as of today. I decided to have my lunch in our beautiful Arts quad and read a nice fat book, but in the sunlight it was too hot and bright, and in the shade bugs were everywhere. I have decided that I will look at Nature now, and make no further attempts to interact with it.  65. Speaking of which, I have the finger of death with plants. I make them die. I’m responsible for all of the plants in our office, and nobody’s caught on yet. Except me. And the plants.  66. I don’t cook, not really, and I don’t have a terrible interest in the assembly and/or preparation of food. I like what I like when I like it, which leads to indifferent eating habits and more than a little wasted money.   67. Ultimately, I want to live in London.  68. When I was in elementary school I had chronic nosebleeds. Balms and pills and cauterizations failed; they simply stopped when I was in the sixth grade, and I haven’t had a serious one since then.  69. Last week I had my ears syringed for the first time. It was the coolest thing ever.  70. I have always been very healthy, as least as far as the eye can see; my teeth in particular have very thick enamel on them (“She smiled to excess, but she chewed with real distinction”). Apart from a kidney infection three years ago I’ve never had anything seriously wrong with me, despite the fact that I think so once every six months or so. When I was little I used to want some kind of exotic disorder; now I thank God that I haven’t got any.

						   51. I am inordinately fond of SmartCars, and, as I was in Paris for my last birthday, got to test-drive one. They are stronger than Geos and faster than Volkswagen Beetles. They are the best cars ever.  52. I’m supposed to be filing right now.  53. Showing people my bare arms is for me an act of almost greater intimacy than taking all of my clothes off – or at least it used to be. I’m getting better now (me, not my arms). My arms in short or no sleeves are the bane of my existence.  54. This morning I realized I have lost my bank card.  55. I lost my virginity when I was sixteen years old, in January 1995. I did it then because I wanted to wait till I was sixteen so that it could be “respectable” – I called my boyfriend over one night when my parents were out, and had candles lit and Prokofiev on and the whole bit, and then I chickened out. He was very understanding. The result was that we did it the next night, with no candles, no Prokofiev, and my parents upstairs watching TV.  56. Despite plans foiled, however, I can honestly say that I’ve pretty much done better than all of my friends on the virginity front – that I know of. I was with someone who loved me, I dictated the time and place, and I didn’t (and don’t) regret anything.  57. I worry a lot about my Destiny – too much, my friends tell me sometimes. It makes me wonder whether I’m trying to write for the love of it, or to have my name on a book that’s in a store. I was referred to at work not too long ago as “our girl who does filey things” and that was when I started to worry in earnest. I want to Be Someone. Or, failing that, I want my coworkers to be able to remember my name.  58. When I marry it will be in a secular ceremony, and my children will not get God doses on a weekly basis. I don’t think it’s crippling or abusive or anything like that: the notion of religion is and has always been completely neutral to me, but I dislike the idea of doctrine. I’m told that children need religion to have structure in their lives; I think this is a copout. I have respect for all faiths and will impart that respect to my children; beyond that, nothing.  59. My first daughter will be named Elizabeth Clara: Elizabeth for Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen, my favorite dead person; and Clara for my grandmother, whom I loved deeply and who died two years ago.  60. I have but one living grandparent now, my father’s mother. She is 79. My other three grandparents died frighteningly young: my father’s father, 44; my mother’s father, 67; and my mother’s mother, 69.

						   41. Speaking of millstones, I really, really want a breast reduction. My size is 32-G – believe it – and when I’m walking outside with the sun at my back, my shadow looks like a reasonably-sized girl walking with a man’s head resting on her shoulder. That’s how massive these fuckers are, and I hate them. I’m going to try going off this weird hormonal birth control first, and see if that does any good, but if it doesn’t – snip-snip! (also suck-suck, graft-graft, &c).  42. When I was eighteen, I briefly dated the creator of Space Moose, a cartoon that ran in the University of Alberta Gateway newspaper from 1989-1999. It was more fun than you might think.  43. I have never had anything but my ears pierced, and I have no tattoos.   44. I often think of my skin – which is very white, and very soft – as God’s compensation for the rest of me.  45. My eyes used to change color, between blue, green, and grey. They settled on green about three years ago and haven’t changed since, as far as I can tell.  46. My stepsister Jessica, who is twenty-one, is studying homoeopathic medicine in Ottawa. Upon examining my eyes – parts of which apparently hold clues to the health situation of every part of the body – she had this to say: “Your lungs aren’t nearly as badly off as they should be, but you do have an abnormally high sex drive.”  47. For clarification purposes, I am a smoker. I have smoked Benson &amp; Hedges Menthol 100s cigarettes since I was seventeen years old. I tried to quit once and became quite homicidal. The lesson I took from this is not that I shouldn’t quit, but that I’ve got to find another way to do it – and it can’t be accompanied by external pressure of any kind.  48. In the past year, I have met Margaret Atwood, Glenda Jackson, and Stephen Fry.  49. I am a very dedicated fan of They Might Be Giants.  50. I like Margaret Atwood somewhat less, and worry that she is the measure of success for every Canadian writer who is a woman.

						   31. The entirety of my talent rests with language – and, to a lesser extent, music. I bashed my way through a degree, and I did well, and I loved it, but it was an uphill struggle, learning to bend my brain in the ever-so-specific way required by academics the world over.  32. My degree is a Bachelor of Arts in History (with an awful minor in English – ugh), with a specialization in early modern England and the history of science and medicine. I loved it – I mean, I really loved it. If I could spend the rest of my life getting Bachelors’ degrees in History, I’d completely, utterly do it. And I thought for a long time that this was my vocation; this was my calling. I could read and teach early modern English history for the rest of my life and be happy. And I really do think I could, but here’s the thing – here’s why I love history: I love listening to stories. And the History & Classics department here has some of the best orators on the continent – wonderful tales that come full-circle and don’t make sense at all until the last word has been spoken - and then everything comes together, and it's as though,  Matrix -like, you've very suddenly been infused with 80 minutes' worth of extremely interesting knowledge.&nbsp; Long story short: I'm not interested (not  very  interested, anyway) in how many shits Elizabeth I took in 1592, and I would have to be to slough through two graduate degrees. And so! I will write novels instead.  33. I started playing the clarinet when I was ten years old. I was very, very good at it. I probably could be again if I dusted off the ole Buffet and gave it a couple of months’ solid work.  34. There were, in fact, about ten minutes there when I was judged the best player of my age group in Canada.  35. My first love was a boy I met when I was thirteen, in my ninth-grade Science class. He gave me my first kiss and kept me in turmoil for more than a year. He liked Leonard Cohen too.  36. (I have always loved Leonard Cohen – seriously, since I was about three)  37. Said first kiss won me $10,000 in 2001, because I wrote 3500 words about it and won the Mactaggart Writing Award.  38. I later expanded this piece to 6000 words.  39. Those 6000 words were recently rejected by  The Atlantic .  40. I now hate the piece, and no, it’s not because it was rejected by  The Atlantic  (have I mentioned this?). It’s because for the last three years, I’ve been expanding it and contracting it and “punching it up” and fiddling with it and sending it places and generally  being known  for it, insofar as I am known. I hate the way it’s attached to me; it feels like a millstone now. Advice to me when I was rejected by  The Atlantic : “Punch it up and send it out again.” It’s been about ten days now and I can’t make myself open the file: I can’t “punch it up” when  I cannot stand it . It’s a goodish piece, and it’s complete, and I’m not going to do nothing, but I and this particular legacy are going through trial separation at the moment.

						   I finally saw  The Lion in Winter .  Ugh.  UGH.  When did Patrick Stewart become a bad actor? He was trained on the  stage . He's been completely, utterly awesome in everything that I've seen him in, and he was genuinely the only part of this film that I was unconcerned about. Unconcerned! And he ended up being the worst thing in it - other than the casting and depiction of John, who was made out to be borderline retarded. Folx: he went to university and studied law. He was smarter than Richard and Geoffrey put together. This is why James Goldman - having boned up on his High Middle Ages history after  The Lion in Winter  was released in 1968 - felt  so awful  about depicting John the way he had that he wrote a  whole other novel  lionizing him, not as a great king (he wasn't), but as a thoughtful, feeling, intelligent man.  But back to Patrick Stewart. He seemed less to want to embody Henry II and more to want to stray as far as possible from Peter O'Toole's performance. Admittedly Peter's shoes are hard to fill, but the end result was that Patrick's every inflection conveyed the exact opposite of whatever it was he was saying. Stunted, stilted, unreal - it was a cheese grater on my thighs. Torture.  And he and Glenn Close, throughout the film, acted like they barely knew each other, led alone suffered through a marriage for thirty years. In 1968, Katharine Hepburn was 61 - the exact age that Eleanor of Aquitaine was in 1183 - and Peter O'Toole was  thirty-seven  - thirty-seven. Believe it. And still they were able to make&nbsp;a thirty-year-old marriage seem not only believable, but natural and inevitable.  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers wound up, then, being the least of my problems: he brought a completely different flare to Philip and didn't seem to be at all aware of Timothy Dalton's performance, which, if you ask me, is the best way to go about a remake. The shining star, though, was Geoffrey, who was brilliant: a diamond in a pile of shit.  Alais was annoying too. Very.  Well, I don't know  what  I was expecting from the director of  Tango & Cash . It was such an incredible relief last night to sit down and watch the original from start to finish, to be reassured that it still existed and hadn't been eclipsed by this refuse that I wasted 167 minutes of my life on.  So that's the last you'll hear about the remake. On to  The Last Unicorn ! Well, maybe when I have more energy.

						   21. My second favorite film is  The Princess Bride . (Heh – I almost wrote “The Princess Bridge”.) I have been compared on sundry occasions by sundry sorts to Valerie. Don’t worry: not being compared to Buttercup has absolutely never bothered me; in fact, I might look a little cockeyed at anyone who would presume to make such a comparison. In the book, after all, she used the word “syllabub” to mean “syllable”, and even Westley had to concentrate on hair like autumn and skin like wintry cream to avoid realizing that Buttercup is more than a little daft. Valerie, on the other hand, is filled with the wisdom of ages. She’s also short.  22. I was born in November. Last year I turned twenty-five.  23. 26 July was Goldsmid Day,  viz . the first anniversary of Mike and I landing in a University College London residence called Goldsmid House, right on Oxford Street, where we lived for almost two months. We were never, ever happier than we were there, despite the fact that it was chronically forty degrees Celsius by day and by night, the noise was atrocious, and anti-Zionist protesters gathered in front of the Marks & Spencer across the street every day bellowing incoherently about how Israel has no right to exist. Anyway, in honor of this wonderful day, Mike got me chocolate, a Dr Pepper slurpee, and  Elizabeth R  on DVD! Happy day!  24. I have one brother, John, who has autism. He is twenty-four and looks just like me except he’s bigger and balder. There is nothing and no one I love on this planet more than I love him.   25. My parents are divorced. They stayed together just long enough to pop out John and me; I have no memory of them being together. Both remarried.  26. I have a half-sister, Irene, who is fifteen years younger than me. I love my memories of her, but she is a stranger to me. There is little sadder than this.  27. Speaking of sad, at the time of going to press, I have been rejected by  The Atlantic . I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop: I had budgeted four full days for absolute despair, and I’ve felt none of it. Perhaps it was far more of an unreality in my subconscious than I imagined.  28. I don’t make friends easily. I am an ass around new people.  29. I can’t write poetry &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at all  30. I like my own consciousness, as Raechel put it: I’m not really a one for drinking and drugs, even recreationally. There have been a few times in my life that I’ve set out to get smashed, but that’s never in reaction to terrible things – mostly just boredom, really. When I’m feeling terrible I’m always afraid that a consciousness alteration will make it worse, not better. Also I hate looking like an ass, and I have a tough enough time avoiding that when I’m sober.

						   11. I’m becoming conservative. No, scratch that. I’m becoming a Red Tory. I think I  am  a Red Tory! I don’t understand why people aren’t simply left alone to live their lives as they see fit. Anyway, I won’t go on because invariably I end up sounding like an ass.  12. I diverge politically from my mother in just about every possible way: she’s far more leftist than I am on every single issue except abortion –  viz . she’s pro-life. She changed her mind in her mid-forties, and she’s wrong, by Christ (haw!).  13. I hate my job. I have a steady, borderline-substantial income for the first time in my life, and I’m grateful for it – this was part of the plan, after all – but the work and the hours are godawful. And now my favorite person in the office is leaving. Good for her, but I’m feeling  very  sorry for myself. It will be very hard to bear on my own.  14. I’ve spent my whole life – I mean my  whole  life – being a mediator, and in the past six months, for the first time, I’m finding myself on a side of altercations, being bitchy and catty and snide, the whole bit. And there’s a burden of guilt that goes with this – I used to envy the freedom of my friends to bandy me around in their various abuses of other people, and I genuinely don’t think I’m doing that, but I’m not feeling their seeming lack of culpability, either. People are actually coming to me with information from the other side. I used to be that messenger. Sometimes I miss it. But my therapist said that my friends “parentify” me, and that it was detrimental to my well-being, so maybe this is better. Who knows.  15. I was a completely different person when I was eighteen years old. I don’t know which version of myself is the right one.  16. I’m left-handed. That makes me pretty super.  17. I’m waiting on either an acceptance or rejection from  The Atlantic . There is nothing worse in the world than this.  18. I have tremendous trouble sleeping, and I don’t often remember my dreams. The slightest disturbance keeps me up all night: heat, noise I don’t like, the wrong textures. If my back isn’t aligned just so. I listen to  Law &amp; Order  and my BBC movies about Elizabeth I and Henry VIII as I’m going to sleep. Luckily this bothers Mike not at all – or so he says. He does prefer it if we’re listening to  The Simpsons  or  Futurama , although the Jane Seymour chapter of the Henry VIII series is his favorite, just because he gets to speak along with Henry’s schoolyard bullying of Thomas Cromwell, ending with “You….  little  man!” and some ferocious shaking.  19. Last night  Inside the Third Reich  landed on my doorstep – a seven-dollar purchase from amazon.ca. I have watched the first hour. It is total fiction. On the up side, though, Derek Jacobi is awesome.  20. Speaking of films, my favorite one is  The Lion in Winter , which I was fortunate enough to receive (from Mike) on DVD this past weekend (not the awful weekend mentioned above). This is a film that people think they should like – because of Peter O’Toole and Katharine Hepburn and the fact that it’s old (ish) – but never believe that they’re going to actually like it. Everyone does – everyone but  everyone . It has come to the point that if a person tells me that he or she finds this film boring, trivial, tedious or irrelevant, I find that it’s more a judgment on that person than it is on my movie.

						   1. I was born in North Vancouver. I lived there less than a year, and needless to say I remember approximately none of it, but for some reason I use this as a key identifier when people ask me about myself. I suppose it’s more cosmo than saying “I grew up in Fort McMurray” (yes, but only until I was ten…).  2. I have very thick wrists for my frame. Like, really thick. I can’t get my thumb and middle finger around them.  3. I have absolutely no self-awareness. I think about myself quite a lot, but it’s always in terms of my Official Version of myself – in a world where I’m not short (damnit, I could have turned that into a whole other thing. That I’m short.), where my tummy doesn’t stick out, where my hair isn’t nearly as bad as I’m sure it is. There are other things, too – mental things – but the bottom line is that I haven’t a clue how other people see me.  4. I’m short. Really. I’m five feet tall. There is no room on my frame.  5. I’ve had a fat issue since I was about nine years old. I’m five feet tall (bringing my shortness into a record three out of five Things About Me so far) and I weigh about a hundred and thirty-five pounds. I’m on the point of saying that it’s a good weight for me, that it suits me, that people don’t look at me and think chubby-tubby. But see #3. I really have no clue. I see photos of myself with other people and I think, “See, they all look the way they normally do. But me? I look like a space alien compared with what I see in the mirror.”  6. I am trying ever-so-hard to be a writer. I developed a plan when I was fifteen: complete a degree, get a mindless job, and write at night. This is proving more difficult than I originally imagined: a mindless job keeps you awake eight hours a day just like any other, and my imagination gets sucked into the ceiling vents; and part of the problem is that I was never a compulsive writer to begin with. When I sit down and do it I do a lot, and I do it well, but I’ve never been a Stephen King, 1500-words-a-day-or-bust sort of person (although when I sit down and do it, 1500 words is hardly enough for me to clear my throat with). So it chugs along in fits and starts. Lots of nail-biting in this vocation.  7. I’m a nice girl but I’m also a hermit, hence some endemic trouble with most of my closer friends, who don’t really like it when I go into a hole for no reason. I’m not the sort of person who calls people just to chat – I’m usually happy to do it when they call me, but for myself it rarely occurs to me. Makes me wonder how Mike and I ever wound up together, because if there’s anyone in the world less likely to pick up the phone than I am, it’s him.  8. I love Mike. Last week we had our sixth anniversary and looked at each other stunned for a few minutes before going to bed (that’s how anniversary celebrations end up playing themselves out, people, just for future reference – last year we drank Diet Dr Pepper and watched Jackass in an awful Glasgow hostel. Really a perfect evening (sincerity)). Six years of someone I have nothing in common with apart from grammar Nazism and a general adoration of all animals, living and stuffed. Really: he’s a fascist and I’m a Reasonable Person. He’s also tall and thin. And I still love him. And for six years it’s been this beautiful thing. And now it’s better than it’s ever been, because, believe it or not, we’re living together.   9. Pre-emptively, this is not remotely a contradiction of #8: I’m not getting married anytime soon, and the world simply has to get over that. Marriage would change approximately nothing about my relationship to Mike: we’d still live together, there would still be random twenty-dollar bills floating through the house (are they mine? are they his? does it matter?). Besides which if we got married the pressure from my mother to procure some grandchildren – already unbearable – would put us both over a chasm.  10. I’m terrified of being a mother. In fact, this past weekend – the worst I’ve had in months – I tried to meditate on the only bright spot I could find: I have no children. I’m coming up against the same age my mom was when she had me, and I’m fine with it. I’m free to be as indulgent and wallowing and self-pitying as I want to be and there’s no one I have to care for. Or, rather, there’s no one I should have to care for. More on that – perhaps – later.

						   So I answered the questions of this  urlLink quiz  honestly and rationally, and here's what they came up with:   You are an SRDF--Sober Rational Destructive Follower. This makes you a font of knowledge. You are cool, analytical, intelligent and completely unfunny. Sometimes you slice through conversation with a cutting observation that causes silence and sidelong glances. You make a strong and lasting impression on everyone you meet, the quality of which depends more on their personality than yours.  You may feel persecuted, as you can become a target for fun. Still, you are focused enough on your work and secure enough in your abilities not to worry overly.  You are productive and invaluable to those you work for. You are loyal, steadfast, and conscientious. Your grooming is impeccable. You are in good shape.   You are kind of a tool, but you get things done. You are probably a week away from snapping.   Is this true?? Good God. Somebody help me out here.

						      What is a saint? A saint is someone who has achieved a remote human possibility. It is impossible to say what that possibility is. I think it has something to do with the energy of love. Contact with this energy results in the exercise of a kind of balance in the chaos of existence. A saint does not dissolve the chaos; if he did the world would have changed long ago. I do not think that a saint dissolves the chaos even for himself,  for   there is something arrogant and warlike in the notion of a man setting the universe in order . It is a kind of balance that is his glory. He rides the drifts like an escaped ski. His course is the caress of the hill. His track is a drawing of the snow in a moment of its particular arrangement with wind and rock. Something in him so loves the world that he gives himself to the laws of gravity and chance. Far from flying with the angels, he traces with the fidelity of a seismograph needle the state of the solid bloody landscape. His house is dangerous and finite, but he is at home in the world. He can love the shape of human beings, the fine and twisted shapes of the heart. It is good to have among us such men, such balancing monsters of love.
