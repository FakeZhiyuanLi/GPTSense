      Hmm...where to start...Okay this morning, er, when i got up, i was really bored. So i got this "great" idea that i should cut my hair. Ya, it wasnt a great idea. But i survived. Then me and Anna were out walking around later on. Mitchel called her, him and Rance wanted to hang out. So me and Anna met them and we swam in some guys backyard and drank Bacardi and it was great. Then we got a call from....The Hotties!! They wanted to hang out. So after i dragged Anna away from Mitchel, we walked to Montrose and met Cody and Cory. We watched them skateboard for a while, then we went to Cory's house. We watched Mr. Deeds. It wasnt too fun cuz me and Anna were still kinda cold and wet from the pool. But we ended up getting their emails, which is awesome. Oh my god, if they read my profile...they could get to my blog, and read what i've said about them. Hmm....oh well whatever. Hehe. Yeah well, I'm gonna go now!! TTFN!! ~Alura

      Yuppo. K, me and Anna left my house, even though my mom said i couldn't, and we just started walking. We ended up walking to corey's house. But this time he was actually there. So we hung out at his house and watched tv with him for a bit. Then Cody and these 2 other guys showed up. We watched Family Guy, and we were kinda talking to Cody. But then the guys decided they were gonna rent Starsky and Hutch. Cody invited us, but the guys we didnt know decided there wasnt enough room for everyone. So Corey drove me and Anna back to my house. I dont think his friends like us lol. Me and Anna had something to eat while my mom ignored us. Then we left again, and we kinda just walked around. After a while Anna's mom called and picked us up and dropped me off. My moms not too mad anymore. I checked my emails, i got one from Kelly!! She wants to do lunch with me and Anna tomorrow. That'll be awesome. Shes moving to Edmonton soon, which will suck. But she said shes gonna take us up there sometime, and that'll be fun too!! But ya im not supposed to be on the computer right now, so im gonna go before Sheri catches me. Thats right, i called my mom sheri lol Luv ya all!! Muah!!!

      I hate my dad. God. Why is he so obsessed with trying to have a kid again. Has he forgotten, he left two kids&nbsp;to rot in grande prairie. I don't think it would kill him to pick up the fucking phone every once in a while. I hate him...but, i love him. Does he even love me? Has he forgotten all those times he said it to me? Lots of people have said they loved me. I actually believed him. If he loves me so much, why havent i heard from him? If i called him, would he know who i was??? Doesnt matter, i cant call him. I dont even know where he is. He is being a drama queen. He's ignoring everyone i could possibly get to pass a message to him from me. I tried to call him on fathers day....ill try again on his birthday. Maybe im wasting my time, i dont know. I still love HIM, he could put a little more effort into his daughters life. And then theres my brother...he still idolizes him. He's let my brother down so badly all his life. And my brother still thinks the world of him. I did for a while. Then i realized what he was doing to me. I actually cared about what he thought and i was hurt because of it. I've been rejected by my own father.

      Okay, so we didn't go to the skatepark. We did get ahold of the hotties, but, as usual, we didnt get the last call which was the most important. So we never met up with them. I dont blame them if we cant get ahold of them, but they could have called us. Blah. Boys are weird. I'm kinda tired tho, I'll write about the whole adventure another time. Rock On Peoples, ~Alura&nbsp;  PS, Thanx to whoever left that last comment!! Nice to know I'm reaching people, hehe. If you guys want, under my profile somewheres theres a place you can email me.

      They're kinda bad at calling us back. We were with the hotties, and we were having fun. They were skating at the stage and skatepark at Musko, then after a while we left&nbsp; to these stairs by the coca cola centre. Corey tried for a while to clear them, then we went back to his house. We were there for a bit then we started heading for this party. But Annas mom called, and she told her we were by Iga. But her mom doesnt trust us so she said she was gonna pick us up and bring us back to my house. We had to run to get to these houses before her, and then she had to talk to my mom so Anna could stay. So then we couldn't leave. But it didn't matter, cuz the hotties never called us. They were supposed to call Anna's cell when they got there, but they didnt call all night. And i think Jeremy might have gone back now, so that kinda sucks. We missed out on his last night if he did leave today.  Me and Anna are gonna head to the skatepark later, maybe we'll see corey and cody there. If we're lucky, we'll see jeremy too. I'll ttyl, and tell you all what happened :) Luv you all!!  Rock On

      Have you ever been really bored, and kinda desperate for something to do, and you find yourself looking at your old convos? I've been reading mine for like, the past hour. Oh my god, things used to be so different. Especially with like, Matt and Casey and Alex mostly. I think i totally wrecked my friendship with Matt when i started to like him. And i used to like, love Casey. I can actually see the exact moment when i realized i didnt really like him that much. And then Alex.....I know what i did with him following every single convo i have with him. Seemed like fun at the time, but not memories i wanna remember now. Things used to be kinda perfect for me with each of them for a little while. But it seems each time, i did something stupid that messed it up. I miss being such good friends with Matt. I miss being so totally in love with my juggalo, lol. I miss my makeout buddy, now one of my best friends boyfriend. I look at some of my not so old convos with Matt, and i cant believe he used to be really nice. I look at some newer convos with Casey, i wonder what me and Anna did to make him hate us like he did for a while. Not saying we didnt deserve it, were kinda vicious sometimes, but sometimes you dont notice what you're doing until after its over. I look at some newer convos with Alex...we havent said anything nice to each other since he started going out with Anna. God, I've made so many mistakes. Things could be SO different right now. I hate what I've done with my life. I seriously wish i could go back and change some things, but who doesnt? My only hope now is i dont mess anything up with the hotties, if they even ever call us again. But ya, I almost made myself cry, I'm gonna stop now. More on this another day, perhaps.  Rock On Peoplez

      I am bored. I'm not tired, so i dont wanna go to sleep. I don't seem to have anyone to hang out with at 3:42 in the morning. So what do I do? And why do I end up bored by myself every night? It's tragic. Do I have a sign on my back that says don't let me be happy or have any fun? Okay. I'm not sure why I'm blogging right now. Mostly because there doesnt seem to be anything else to do. Also because my mom is gonna want on the computer soon but if i say I'm busy writing she'll let me on longer. As soon as she goes to work and my brother goes to bed, i just wanna sit here, music cranked, and I'm going to think. Think about why they didnt call, about why people are stupid, or mean or whatever, about why I am sitting here by myself right now. Also, I just like to sit and listen to Nirvana. Omg, i love Kurt Cobain. He's like, my hero. Does anyone read this besides the people i get to read it? Is there anyone out there reading this who i dont know is doing so? Am i affecting anyone out there, does anyone care what i have to say? Blah, I'm gonna stop now. Maybe have some coffee. I promise, I wont post anymore unless I have something exciting to talk about.  Cya pplz,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the good times roll

      ...They didn't call. Am i over-reacting? Maybe something came up, maybe they got the wrong number. Maybe they never wanted to call in the first place. What should i do tomorrow?? Wait and see if they call me? Try to call them? Do i forget about them now, was ignoring us their "I don't like you" hint? I'm confused, I don't know what to do. Like, I really like them. Theyre kool. Theyre hot. I THOUGHT they liked us, maybe they dont. I was actually looking forward to seeing them again. I guess that's what i get for trusting in someone.  I seriously hope i get to talk to them tomorrow. I hope there's a chance for me to get to know them. Me and Anna like, stalked them for a couple of days before we actually talked to them. We at least deserve a chance, don't we?  Maybe I should just give up on guys altogether...If I told someone i was gonna call them, I'd actually call them. I wouldn't just leave people hanging like this. God, everytime the phone rang I'd jump. Stupid, stupid, stupid.  I don't know what to do people, someone, anyone, help me pleeaase!!  Maybe i'll do more on this later   Luv Ya, Muah!!   Comment!!!

Can you believe it??  Hehe, I'm being dumb. And stalkerish. Sorry guys, just had to get that out of my system.   TTYL!!!

      Hehe. Okay, today was great! Me and Anna went down to Musko. We were at the skatepark, hot guy hunting, and we saw Alex. It was kinda funny, he was trying to skateboard. So we were like, almost about to leave, and I looked up and saw the hotties from yesterday! It took us a while to actually talk to them, but we got their numbers and went with them to corys house for a bit it was awesome. Omg, we didnt ask if they had girlfriends. I hope they dont. This is awesome, shit, this is exactly what i pictured my summer to be like. Haha, Alex was so mad. he'll be even madder when he finds out that his girlfriend likes other guys. This should be fun, some hot kool new friends for us. La la la la la, life is so fab! Hey, if anyone reads this, post a comment! I feel so alone, let me know what you think about my stuff!!  Luv ya all! TTYL!!!   ~MuAh!!~

      Arg. People can be so stupid sometimes. Apparently, Anna didn't actually dump Alex yet. How can she be doing this to herself? How can you stay with someone like him....I'm kinda worried about her. He's good at taking advantage of people, i know that....  Why do people put themselves through that? Do they think they're in love? Do they feel like they need that person? Anna doesn't need shit from him. He totally doesn't respect her at all. She deserves better.  But she won't get out of it, and I'm trying to help her but it's not doing much. The best thing for me to do is sit and wait for her to do it. Eventually she'll get fed up with his bullshit....  I'm sorry, I'm wasting your time. You probably don't care about my friend's mistakes. I just don't want her to get hurt.  Love is overrated.  Everyone wants it, somewhere inside they have this desire to be wanted and needed and to have someone to call their own. But everytime I've seen people in "love" it hasn't worked out very well for them. How many people do you know with divorced parents? I'm sure they thought they were in love once. Even I thought I was in love once. But i just made myself think that because it was what i wanted at the time.  The last time I let myself get close to a guy I got hurt in the process. i had decided love didn't matter, and i decided all i wanted was someone to like, do stuff with. So i ended up losing my virginity to someone i now hate. He was the first guy that ever made me cry. Because he decided he was done with me, and went on to try to do the same to Steph, and now he's doing it to Anna.  We're all so stupid. We all seemed to have fallen for him. People like him are the reason Jesus had to die. Even after what he did to me, he has the nerve to call me a whore. Because i gave myself away to HIM. Stupid, stupid, stupid.  All we can do is try to get through life, and keep away from people that will only hurt us. And maybe, if we're lucky, we'll find that one special person that will laugh with us when we're happy, and wipe away our tears when we're sad. The person who makes you feel beautiful. The person who makes you feel needed, wanted. The person you need and want back. The person you'll want to spend the rest of your life with. If you can find that person, you can't hope for anything better.

      Title thanx to Leah, The Hot Yellow Shorts Girl!    Okay. Today was kinda fun. I've settled back in! Me and Anna went down to Musko today. It was great, we saw a guy that looked just like Matt. Same hair, same kinda clothes. Cept he was taller. And he had HOT friends. We were watching them skateboard for a bit. I like, clapped when this one guy landed a trick they had been trying for a while and he looked at us and he had the cutest smile. I hope we see them all again.But i dont know how we could, and we didnt get their names or emails or anything. So me and Anna made our way back, stopped to talk to people we didnt know. Some little boys were calling us sluts or something, it was kinda funny.  When we got to my house Anna decided to call Alex. They argued for a while, and it ended in her going out to dump him. But then her mom called and she had to go. So here I am alone again! Go me! God i need something to do! Bah. Summer is gay. Actually, i cant imagine any other time being better. Fuck now im confused. Well my night is over. I'd stop writing but then I'd have nothing else to do. Gayness. W/e, I'm out.  Rock On pplz.

      Alright. I just got back from Edmonton. Does anyone care? I couldn't even find something to do on my first night back. If i had i probably wouldn't be writing this right now. Edmonton was fun though. It was kinda like a break from...everything. And i was with friends instead of family, so I could actually enjoy myself a bit. Apparently Matt and Tim came by while I was gone. Now 2 of my mom's bf's x-box games are missing. They both deny their part in it. People are so annoying. Why aren't there any decent guys around here? And if there is, why don't I know them?  I'm beginning to think I'll never meet the perfect guy. Everytime I thought I had before, it blew up in my face. Maybe I was just meant to be an old woman woth cats. I mean, someone's gotta be old with cats, right? Might as well be me.  Stupid life. Stupid Grande Prairie. Stupid assholes in Grande Prairie. Pssht, like I'd have better luck anywhere else. I kinda think I know what I'm looking for. Someone who's nice, smart, funny, kinda good looking i guess, someone who's fun to be around. Mostly, someone i can trust, someone I can rely on. I can't even rely on my family anymore. It appears my dad would rather run around with his new girlfriend and try to start a new family than be with me. Or even call me occasionally. I'm not even totally sure where he is right now. Wow, i didn't think I'd get to be talking about this shit. I'm gonna go for now, maybe I'll write some more later.

      My hair!! It's cuz i cut my hair!!! Even Bryce pointed out, my hair before gave me that punk look i was so proud of. He said i look like a prep now. So when i cut my hair all off, it got rid of the mystique and allure of my being. So Cody lost interest.  I hope my hair grows back before i see Jeremy again, If i see him again. Stupid Vancouver. They took Hottie #1!!! But ya, I'm quite tired, and im rambling. I will change my mind about all of this tomorrow! But for now, i best be hittin the old dusty trail. *****Ciao!*****

      Hey Guys!! I haven't written in a while!! Did ya miss me?? I fuckin missed writing. Okay, so first I'll give you all a Hottie update. The night before Anna went to Edmonton, me and her went over to Cody's. Cory had already left to...somewhere. So it was just me and Anna and Cody. We were watching movies, it was pretty fun. Anna couldn't handle Nightmare on Elm Street (im joking hunny!!) so we were gonna watch Scary Movie, but it wasn't in the case. And while Cody was looking for it, Annas mom called. But when she went home, i stayed. Me and Cody watched the first Nightmare on Elm Street, then like, half of Little Nicky. We didn't do anything. If he had made a move i prrrobably would have, but he didn't. I called Anna after cody dropped me off. It was the last time i talked to her while she was in town still. The next day Anna was gone, i was already missing her, lol. I had told Cody to call me when he got off work but he never did, I called him once, his brother said he was at a friends. The next day i tried to call like, 4 or 5 times. I got ahold of him the day after that, but he didn't wanna do anything. I ended up drinking with my mom and Chris. Today Anna got back (yay!) and she was over, with an unlimited curfew!!! But even though we got ahold of Cody, he went drinking with "Lauren". We called Cory too cuz he got back today, and he was supposed to talk to Cody then call us back. We didn't get any calls. I think I've been ditched again. Like, i used to be almost positive Cody liked either me, or Anna, hell, maybe both as more than a friend. But now i don't think he likes us at all. It's bad enough he won't call me when he says he will, but i can't even call him. This is stupid. Anyways, me and Anna called Daniel tonight, talked to him and his friend, Aaron i think it was. I talked to them for like an hour, and its very long distance. My mom will get a lovely phone bill. I also found and mailed Daniel's letter. But i just remembered i didn't send him a stamp and i think i was supposed to. Oh well, life goes on. Oh god, schools gonna be starting soon. I sooo dont wanna go. Another 10 months of torture...I'm going to die. Okay, I'm not going. They can't make me!!! Oh hey, me and Anna made a friend! Hehe. Some chick added me from my profile i think, she just moved to Grande Prairie. She's going to the Comp for grade 10 this year too!! Me and Anna are going to see The Village with her and her friend Marlo i believe. Her name is Katie, she's awesome. Katie if you're reading this, you're awesome!! She has good taste in music, shes funny, i think we'll get along great.
