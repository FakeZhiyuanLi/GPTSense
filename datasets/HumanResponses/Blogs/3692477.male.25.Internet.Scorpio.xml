      Its 20th of June, and its about the 20th of June and its about 6 weeks before I set of Overseas, to check the world around me.  Tokyo, UK then Thailand.  Just starting the blog so that I can keep track of all the becomings of the trip.  Tokyo, well my bro Nick lives and works there, so me and my other bor Tony, will be up there 5 days, to check his plush pad, whose work pays for. (HighRoller). I'm hoping that he can really supply the geishas at our disposal.  Seriously it will be great to get to see the Japanese life style, especially with so much ancient history behind them, and the chance to see where they where and where they are now.  I love the ancient history of cities.  UK, well yet another family members there, my sister sledge and mother dearest.  Firstly to London, to catch up with a few mates. Ben and Dita, Mejulie and Emma and hopefully many more.  I will end up traveling around the country side to see most of England and then up in Edinburgh to check my cream in my coffee, lucy poo (my sister).   Its been roughly a year and a bit since I have seen her.  Missing but know that she is having a good time.  I only hope that she can let go of connections back home, so that she can really experience the true meaning of living.  I want, more to the point want her to get on with her now life that she has set up in Edinburgh.    We used to be almost inseparable, as we lived together, partied together and without a doubt spoke so much shite together it wasn't funny.  I haven't meet to many people with the same kind of relationship that me and my sis has, which I love the fact that we do.  Beloved Mater.  Living in north of London by herelf looking for work at roughly 55yrs old.  She packed up home to travel the world again, with nothing but a bit cash under her belt.  Of course she has relatives back in the mother land England, but she has packed up shop to get a bit of the good life.  Pretty admirable for a women her age, and there not a person that I tell that says the same thing.  Good stuff mum, your licing it up, like there is no tomorrow. It takes a strong women to do something like this, and not look back epspecially when you have left Peter at home and of course Pippi the cat.    Back to the journey, ending in Thailand. By this time I will probably have no money left and I thought that Thailand would be a great place to relax and take in the Thai lifestyle that I have heard all about.  Rock Cimbing, drinking, eating good food and living it large.  I am hoping that a friend comes along. She said she would meet me in Thailand, (if I'm lucky) but not holding my breath, as she has shite to sort out as she just has broken from a long term relationship.  I don't matter, if would be grand if she did some, but either way I'm going to make the best of this trip.  This trip will probably determine whether I live overseas or not next year.  If I don't get the raise or promotion that I deserve next year, I think I will pack up shop and head overseas again.    Any way, can't wait to get over there and finally see the places that I want and the trip that I needed.  It has been over 6 years since I have taken 6 weeks off. Its not a long time but Its been a long time since I have gone on any big trips, so as I said this will be the decision making point to stay over there.  Thats my story so far, still in planning stages I will be updating this every couple of weeks.  Peace out Respect
