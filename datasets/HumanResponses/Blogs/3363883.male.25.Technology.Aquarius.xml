      Not many people in my age group manage to go out and have what I would call good clean fun.  To do this, you have to pass a number of criteria. 1] It doesn't involve drugs 2] It doesn't involve getting drunk 3] It doesn't involve Sex 4] It doesn't involve breaking the law 5] It doesn't involve more drugs  Some people would argue that if you had a night out without performing at least one of the above then you're either dead or a mormon.  If I offend any mormon's reading this .. .. .. .. what the f*ck are you on a computer for?  Still.  I went out last night and managed to not do any of the above and still have a great time.  How I can hear you all ask.   Bowling.  I think it might be making a comeback.  This was the way to spend your days in the 80's.  And while I didn't spot anyone quite like "The Dude" from the Big Lebowsky, I'm glad to say that there are still some freaks that go bowling.    Long live the mullet.  I managed to surprise myself with the scores.  There was 11 of us.  A mixture of people from work and some friends that I go dancing with.  It was all pretty relaxed with people finding amusing ways of running the ball down.  I ended up winning both games with scores of 160 and 146 respectively.  I think I was pretty damn lucky.  But luck doesn't pay the bills so the bets that I made with people paid for my game. :- )  I might find myself going out again at some point further down the track for a game.  I'll need to wait though.  Have to give my mullet time to come out.

      Well, that's another weekend gone in a flash.  It all started with having a pub crawl with people from work as we were celebrating four different birthday parties.  Alice, Jaimie, Mike and Dave.  We started at the Head of the river which is one of the more stylish and prominent pubs in oxford.  It greets all travellers coming along abingdon road from south Oxford when they go over the Thames and enter central Oxford. A great pub that has wonderful atmosphere which you ultimately end up paying extra for.  But you can't put a price on good times right?  I know I've whinged about friends being fashionably late, but my flat mates and I managed to get in about an hour and a half later than anyone else due to us being sensible and cooking up some sheperds pie to have before hand.  Of course, what do you do while you're waiting for everything to cook?  Have a couple of beers and a few bottles of wine.  By the time we actaully reached the pub, people there were having to catch up to us instead of the other way around!  It was a fair turn out of about 30 people from work and 10-15 other people that I didn't recognise.  I assume they were friends who though they could brave going to a work party.    We then went on to go to Checkers and then Thirst for cocktails and a bit of a boogey.  By this time it was roughly 2 in the morning and the full days work was starting to kick in.  So with more drink and a couple of rough piggie backs from friends, we all hopped on the bus and headed home!  Any surprises?  It can't be a work party without a bit of gossip.  One of my good friends, Kirsty ended up pulling another good firned of mine Bush.  The fact that Bush had been chasing Kirsty for months was turned on it's head when she ended up going after him.  I think everyone was taken by surprise no less than Bush himself.  Still.  Happy days and it's very cool to see them all kissy and huggy huggy.  I'm sure I'll get tired of it in the next week and tell them to "Get a f*cking room."  Saturday involved playing cards.  I got home at about 3 from the pub crawl and was up at 7 again as I was going to pick up some friends for a tournament in stokenchurch which is about half way between oxford and london.  There were just over forty competitors and I managed to make top 8.  It was GREAT to see a friend of mine, Neil, whom I get to see rarely these days on account of him being a respectable new father.  As soon as we finished I headed straight back into Oxford and picked up Prudence and Miriam.  Prudence is a very sweet lass that I know from back in Adelaide.  I knew her from her days in the Adelaide Jane Austen society.  Fortunately, those days are long behind us.  In case you were wondering, my mother is the Chair of this society and i would go along and offer support as the dutiful son pi.e. break legs of any hecklers].  I'd like it known that my interest had nothing to do with Colin Firth whatsoever.    Miriam is an old family friend of Prudence and I gather they have known each other for years.  After picking them both up and taking them back home to wash up, we went back into oxford.  I took them to the Eagle and Child pub whose claim to fame is it was the "local Pub" for both J.R.R.Tokien and c.s.lewis.  We managed to fit only a pint in before the bar was closed which was unfortunate.  So we moved onto O'Neils which was doing a special in classic Irish music.   Aparently the listing of "classic" irish music is anything that is done by U2 or the Pogues.  Neither are in my top 500 bands and if it wasn't for the fact that it was the only pub around with a late license, I'm sure we would have moved on.  My flat mates met us and our drinking continued until the early hours and we took the bus back home.  for some reason everyone was in a fighting mood that night.  We must have seen about 3 different fights .. .. all at our bus stop outside the kebab van.  Apologies to Pru and Mim! Oxford normally isn't that bad! Honest.  I guess people had been drinking since 3 that afternoon as it was the FA cup final [ManU 3 vs Millwall 0].  Sunday was a mixtue of stonehenge and punting with a bit of chinese food thrown in.  Trying to compress that into one sentence was remarkably easy.    As the weather was so glorious I took them to stonehenge as it had been about a year since I had last gone and it's not too long a journey.  The girls always wanted to go punting as well, so I organised to go with a large group of us.  There was 11 of us that got together and we managed to fit on two punts easily enough.  Unfortunately, we were in the middle of oxford for convenients sake and no one had told us that there was a massive College rowing regatta on the following week.  Everyeone and their brother was out rowing to get some practice in.  It was very VERY tedious as we managed to get in every teams way.  I'd say I felt bad but we had every right as they did for being there and they really were THAT rude about it.  God I hate toffs and rowers are always the worst.  If they want the river that badly to themselves, I don't know why they don't ask "daddy" to buy them some little creek out of the way to pratice on .. .. .. .. .. say pluto.  Punting was great fun if a lot harder than I initially thought.  I admit though, I'm a dab hand at giving criticism.  No dramas there.  Tips for the would be punter: 1] Have a couple of beers before hand.  This gives you the confidence to get up on the stack at the end of the boat which is about half a foot above the cold murky water and be the only one with control over the 12 foot boat with nothing but a big chopstick. 2]Go somewhere quiet.  Being hit by rowing people is not fun.  Even if it is an all girls rowing club.  They all "cycle" together and if you get one in a bad move, they will ALL be in a bad mood.  Not pleasant at all. 3] Go somewhere shallow.  Sticking your chopstick into the water to find it slip through your hands as the water is over 14 feet deep is not much fun.  It's even less fun trying to explain this to an oncoming group of very angry and hormonal rowing girls. 4] have more beer to handle point number 3 better.  The eveneing was round up by going to the chinese and having some sweet and sour MSG; some crackling msg; some MSG chow Mein and some MSG with black bean and pepper.  Not bad, but I found myself bouncing of the walls at two in the morning meaning I have had even less sleep today than the previous two nights.  Oh well.  I guess during the week is when I'm supposed to be having a break but today is another dinner party.  Bushra is cooking us some sudanes dishes.  I'm not sure what to expect, but I believe it will come with couscous.  Will let you all know.  Anyway.  back to the daily grind.

      Well, I'm sick of the flop that I have.  It was getting in my face and annoying me.  If I glanced in a mirror I was starting cousin IT more and more on a weekly basis.  It had to go.  So I booked into one of the local hairdressers at lunch and got my hair cut by a sweet young lass who was 25 and had 4 kids.  How other peoples lives are different then hey?  I managed to get a couple of inches off all 'round.  The verdict is good apaprently.  I've even had a couple of the blokes at work give the thumbs up which I think is more positive than worrying.  I always get annoyed when you ask people if they like your hair and their reply is: "Of course, don't touch a thing, it looks beautiful!!", then when you get a new cut they come out with "Oh thank god you got rid of that trash, you look, like, sooooo much better."  Don't tell me that any of you HAVEN'T been there!!  But it's looking good.  The best compliment I've had so far is that I look 10 years younger.  Well.  i'll take it as a compliment and not as much like an insult.  now I just need to work on losing a touch of weight and I'll just about match my profile photo :- ).

      I ended up playing football [soccer] for a little over an hour last night with people from work. It was great fun.  While I'n not as fit and definately not as good as some of the others, I'm less embarassing then some people too.  A quiet refreshing beer afterwards to catch up on who fell down and who scored is always good fun.   Some friends, Bush and Raphael came back to the house and with my flat mate I made a "classic" punjabi curry.  Despite my usual tendency to cook things to death and for a long time, I manage to get everything done in half an hour.  All I did was chicken, lentils and rice in a basic tomatoe sauce.  I didn't have any coconut milk which is probably a good thing as I'm a sucker for it.  So we munch, get drunk and Paul and I head to our [seperate] beds at about 11.  A nice relaxed evening.  Which is a hell of a lot better this morning.  I come into work with nothing but people flapping about.  Some new software was deployed.  Do I have anything to do with it?  Barely, but it's up to me to liase with contractors and users and get everything sorted out [sigh].  Nothing went right.  Eventually everything is looking good and users are content for the moment.  I thought I would go out for a nice ride on my bike at lunch.  The weather wasn't looking too bad and I could destress a little by peddling my worries away.  I went and cycled around all of Abingdon which is about a 30-40 minute trip.  I was halfway through, in a suburb called peechcroft when I heard the sounds that all bikers dread [apart from the screech of car tyres] .. .. .. phut-sssssssssssssssssssssssss.  I managed to catch a flat at possibly the furthest point from my house and work.  So I managed to come back late to work with a flat tyre and need to walk it home after work.  Some days it's just not worth getting out of bed this morning.

      Well, after scrambling out of work at 5 o'clock to find the day just beautiful,  we're looking at 25 degrees and hardly any clouds.  Just stunning.  I thought it'd be nice to have a cruise on my bike.  I took it down a bike path to Didcot which is one of the more fiscally challenged towns about.  Similar to Springfield in the simpsons with it's MASSIVE reactors for making electricity [coal though, not nuclear].  It's about a 4 mile journey each way.  I think I took a wrong turn on the bike path and managed to go straight to the local tip which was NEXT  to the power plant.  MMmm. What a pretty site it was.  Next time I'll take my camera I think.  I'm sure I can get photoes on this webt site.  I'll try and update it regularly.  So after my ride I joinged my flat mates and some friends at our local pub, the White Horse for a quick pint before it was decided that the weather was good enough for a barbeque [bbq].  So 8 of us got together got some burgers and atlantic salmon and proceeded to drink and eat late into the evening.  And on a school as well!!  School's out for Summer Baby.  Alice Cooper, eat your f*cking heart out.

      Well it's the end of another hectic Monday.  It's amazing, I wander into work with a couple of odd jobs to do and somehow these things take up the entire day!  Between meetings and fixing user problems the day is just over.  Good.  We are FINALLY getting some glorious sunshine and I managed to con about 15 boys and girls to come down to the local park here in abingdon for a kick about with both an english  and an australian football.  Funny how everyone just thought it's like kicking a rugby ball . . . . . except that they keep toeing it and hurting themselves :- ).  Just came off a glorious weekend.  What was so special?  I spent both days away from work.  The last 7 weeks have involved me doing 6 day weeks which is great for my bank account, just not me.  I spent Saturday in southampton with a great Australian friend Bel.  We walked around, had a meal and she took me on a tour of the "Jewel of the Caribbean" which is where she works as a croupier.  This "Ship" or “Big f*ck off floating city” that I affectionately call it is bigger than big.  14 stories containing gyms/restaurants/23 bars/health clinics/shops/theatres and anything else you would ever want.  Just fantastic.  The price, I can hear you all ask. If you want to go ritzy [but not the best], you're looking at about US$20,000 for 7 days.. .. .. .. .. each.  pretty damn exclusive.  Oh and that doesn't include booze :- ).  So that was wonderful. Sunday started quietly with fixing up my friend Phil's boat.  A bit of varnish and it was looking good, so good in fact that we celebrated with a pub crawl of beautiful yet ridiculously hard to find pubs in oxford.  If you are in oxford or have any inclination to go.  I heartily recommend the following pubs:  The Trout [how many pubs come with their own peacock?] The Isis [only accessible by a mile long walk or a boat.  DEINATELY no roads] The Victoria Arms [A forty minute punt ride from the centre of Oxford]  After doing all three we then moved onto a barbeque at another work friends house and that rounded out the weekend just lovely.    Thank goodness it's work time otherwise I'd never get a break :- )

      Good Morning To you!!  This is my first blogger entry and I'm trying desperately not to make a mess out of it.  I've been looking at other blog sties to see how people get started but there are no introductions; no nothing.  People just launch into their life storis.  I thought I'd give a quick review on who I am so the next couple of entries would make a remote bit of sense.  wibble wobble wibble wobble [ala Wayne's World style]  I'm a 25 year old sad little IT man.  Apart from being one of the dilbert look alike freaks, I'm an Australian trying to start up a career in Oxford, England.  I've been here two years now and have settled in somewhat. I come from Adealide in South Australia.  What's known as the "City of Churches".  Says it all really.  Nice place to drive through.  Maybe even bring your kids up.  Not a place to crack your first million by wheeling and dealing.  Still.  It's hard to find anyone nicer than in Adealide either so you take what you can get.  Being australian and in foreign parts, I tend to write large group emails out letting people know about my latest actions.  I've been doing this for a couple of years, and to be totally honest I'm finding it harder to get the motivation to write.  I thought I'd give this a wirl as an alternative.  Almost like an online diary even.  At least, I can remind myself of what's been happening the last couple of days because being pretty scatty sometimes I can forget the basics [breathing, working the legs etc...]  So sit back.  Enjoy the ride and I hope someone finds this little blog spot on the interesting side.

      Okay,   So I've been quiet for the last couple of days.  If I haven't been drunk then I've been recovering.  I think I mentioned a detox in my last entry.  Think I might have blown that a little.  Oh well.  I haven't had a drink for a couple of days which is good but I think I might blow that tonight with a going away party in a curry house.  Play it by ear.  I will talk about the weekend in a later blog when I have some time for more writing.  I'm in a mixture of moods today.  I had an absolutely dreadful night filled with nightmares which is something I haven't done for years.  I dreamt of an Ex giving me a good deal of abuse.  I think the term she used was "Victimised".  Just thinking makes me shiver.  Funny how dreams can seem so real.  What you perceive is your reality I guess.  Think my subcouncious still needs some work.  Pass me a beer :- )  On a lighter note however, I got some emails from some truly wonderful friends back home in Adelaide [and brisbane].  A BIG hello to Che and Sarah.  It was wonderful hearing from both of you and it makes me feel warm and fuzzy knowing that time can pass between us but when we do catch up, you know that things won't have changed in our relationship either.  Being away from so many people makes you appreciate these kind of relationship so much more.  A big Hug and Kiss to Alex J as well.  I had a wonderful conversation with her on monday.  Over the last couple of weeks, things have been a bit strained, with relations back home and my own personal life.  It's nice to hear a friendly voice who will always hug you [phonewise] when you need it and give you a good kick up the arse when you need it even more.  She is a one of a kind and someone whose contact I will never lose despite me being half a world away.  Thankyou so much for being you Alex.  Also.  Some people have asked where all the photos have gone.  The software used was "Hello" which was allright apart from causing my machine to crash out at bizarre times.  I ended up taking it off and opla, it's all fine again.  I think I read a new version has come out, so I might see if I can put it on and give people more photos.  Always nice to let you in on photos of my world.

      Well thank god it's nearly the end of the week.  I suspect I will be doing some sleeping over the weekend.  I'm supposed to have a friend, Wako, up this weekend from London but I haven't heard anything yet.  I haven't organised anything to do when he's up there which probably means we're going to get excessively battered and have a kebab somewhere.  Tonight however is something that I'm definately looking forward to.  England play Portugal in the first quaterfinal of the Euro Cup.  It's a shame that we play the Host first.  I don't think they have as good a chance as England does to win.  Either way, it's a good excuse for a barbeque and a beer. It's a bit blowy outside but the sky is blue and I wouldn't be doing my country proud unless I was searing some flesh somehow.  My house has also managed to pick up a projector from work.  I use the term "pick up" very loosely.  Actually, it's probably a very good description as that's exactly what we did .. .. .. .. .. .. just while no-one else was looking.  So we will be watching the football on a screen larger than most pubs in oxfordshire are offering.   Excellent.  I've asked that if I get a bit too tired and emotional [read "pissed out of my brain"], to please drag me in front of the screen so I don't actually miss out on anything.  So what else has happened?  The Good news: We Won the Lotto  The Bad news: We only Won a tenner  The Good news: No one actually got the jackpot  The Bad news:  Our chance of ever winning the jackpot are zilch  The Good News: With a tenners worth of tickets bought extra, we have ten times the chance.  The Bad News: .. .. .. Can I have my frogurt now?    [If you've never watched a Simpson Halloween special, this might have gone over you a little.]

      Well the start of another week.  Funny, you almost look at it as a turning over a new leaf.  I don't know if I'm the same or different to to other people [most likely different].  If I ever wish to do something out of my normal character, then I won't do it until a monday.  I'll be ready for a new frame of mind and will have hopefully talked myself into this new change by monday morning.  This month's change is trying to become healthy again.  In fact, this has been going on for the last fortnight, but I know it started on a monday.  My flat mates and I decided that perhaps we had been eating a little too much comfort food and it was about time to get some healthy food into us.  It doesn't help when you're being told this by a lass who is stick thin and couldn't put on an ounce of weight even if it involved eating a kilo of cadbury's best.  Oh well.  If they're happy ot put up with healthy food, then god knows I am.  As it is, we've only slightly improved our dietry habit.  I eat less and convince myself that putting some lettuce on my sandwhich is now healthy.  However, I have hit the gym very hard and that's good.  My flat mates are both very fit, and trying to keep up with them is much more of an incentive for losing weight.  Over the weekend I managed to ride to oxford and back and then go on a five kilometer run which isn't too bad .. .. .. both days.  I've never really been totally unfit and sometimes I surprise myself with what my body let's me get away with.  Still, I hope to be able to jog for a little and kepe up the weights and get down to 69 kilos.  I was just a bit oabove this before i left for the states, and I managed to keep it off there.  But 10 days of mum's cooking is all it take to put it ALL back on.  Oh well.  I'd much rather add an hour to my day exercising then totally revamp my current diet.  As per most sunday's we managed to have a takeaway indian and watch Portugal squeeze out a goal with big term rivals Spain.   I'm still detoxing but not quite so hard now.  The occasional beer seems to float in, but it's limited to only a couple.  I'm still fas free after a fortnight and feeling good for it.  I don't want to jinx it.  I havn't gone this long in Enlgand since I first got here.  So if I keep it up, it should be happy days ahead.  I know that I wouldn't be at the gym AT ALL if I was still fassing.  So hopefully, that change will be for the better.  Enlgand play Croatia tonight in the eurocup.  It's all sudden death now.  If england lose a single game, they're won't stay in the league.  That said.  if they win the next four games, then they will be crowned European Cup champions of 2004.  I really hope they do win.  I think it would be great to be here if they did make it!  How hard can four straight games be?

      The Euro cup started off with the last weekend.  Everything in England has totally shutdown while everyone is looking on in angst for Enlgand to come through.  it's funny.  In Australia, everyone is very appreciative of their sport and enjoy it.  I think the typical Australian will be more than content to sit down with a beer and watch just about anything.  If Australia is playing, even better.  There will be cheers of Aussie-Aussie-Aussie which has thankfully died down an awful lot after the sydney olympics.  However, the English are deeply passionate about two things; their country and football/soccer.  It's funny.  In no way am I not patriotic.  I will be one of the first people to say that Australia is the best place in the world.  We're loud and boistrous and enjoy ourselves.  If someone says their country is better, we'll listen to their argurmen, weigh up what they say and probably tell them to blow it out their arse and go for a beer.  n England, people can't even conceive that there is a better place and people will be tempted to be almost violently opposed to anyone saying otherwise.  Their passion is very deep, stiff and I think old fashioned.    However, it is very entertaining.  There is nothing like being in an English pub and watching Wayne Rooney score for england.  I'm afraid even Australia couldn't top that.  Everyone's hugging and buying each other beers and shouting  "Roon-ey Roon-ey" and the good times are rolling.  This was last night when England beat Switzerland 3-0 in the group stage of Euro 2004.  I thought it was a good game, I don't know which I enjoyed more, the game or the crowd.  I was the ONLY person in the 100 person crowd [in a pub that fits 50] to NOT wear an enlgish football top.  I got a couple of weird looks but eventually it was circulated that I was Australian and supported Enlgand while I was here and that was all fine.    Tally-Ho.  A friend here told me that to be a true English Supporter there are a number of criteria: 1]Drink two pints of wife-beater [Stella [long story]] in the first half 2]Drink 4 pints in the second half 3]Think Emile Heskey plays like a Donkey on acid.  From here, There are two schools of thought.  If England lost, the people from the old school of thought would get a couple more rounds in, start calling out "IN-GI-LAND" and then make for the nearest non-white person and knock his block off.  The new school of thought is to just weep quietly and think about what went wrong.  The most obvious response is always "Why the f*ck did Sven [coach] put Heskey on!!".  I prefer the new school of thought.  Much safer for the token australian.  England played france in their first game.  I didn't know much at the time so I'm assuming you [dear reader] don't either.  GOing into the match, France has not lost a game in the previous 18 matches and hadn't been scored against in the last 11.  That's pretty strong.   I went to a very good friends place that evening for the game.  He did a real treat of cooking a luscious barbeque.  Thankyou Neil, the mozarella, basil and tomatoe sausages were stunning.  And everyone was in a good mood.  This was hightened when England managed to score the opening goal.  You could actually hear the whole neighbourhood scream out at the same time.  Oh Happy times.  The rest of the game was about England just trying to stay ahead.  There was a penalty where Beckham miscalculated his kick and kcicked almost to the goalie [whom he had played at Manu for the previous three years].  This sent a bit of an emotional shockwave though the english team, they got slow and tired.  So what did the best team in the world do?  They came back to score one goal in the last 30 seconds of the game and then to win by scoring in injury time.    This is stuff that heroes are made of .. .. .. in france.  So I am eagerly waiting the final match against croatia so see if where the emotional roller coaster takes me.

      Well I think it's safe to say that summer has finally hit.  The suns out, the birds are singing and away in the distance you can hear the faint sound of sneezing and wheezing of someone else discovering that they've got hayfever.  As for me, I'm dosed up higher than a hippie at an open air fair and it's just great.  No itchy eyes, no sneezes and no sore throat.  I'm in a temporary state of bliss which will hopefully last for the next thirty minutes before another attack.  I'm struggling a little on sleep, but at least the reason this time is becasue I was out late.  I managed to actually have five consecutive hours sleep, it was truly wonderful.  Where to start on the last couple of days.  Over the weekend, I managed to do a fair bit of riding, starting with going to didcot and back [10km each way] and then sunday was to oxford and back [about the same] so I'm getting use of the bike and getting out in the fresh pollen saturated air.  I love it in England that when the weather does finally become ogod, then EVERYONE comes out and is in a good mood.  Usually this just means moving from inside the bar to the beer garden outside but it still counts as movement of some description.  I also managed to have a swing at golf for the first time which was ace.  One of my friends, Ross, has a driving range just near his house in Drayton [south of oxford].  He asked if I was interested in a swing.  Now golf was never quite my style.  I associate it with old people, toffs and people who enjoy wearing plaid.  As it was though, it was great fun.  Hitting a little ball can be incredibly theraputic.  I wasn't quite prepared for the jarring though.  It's funny but if you hit the little 200gram ball incorrectly it's almost akin to taking a big metal bar and hitting a wall with it.  After hitting 90 balls my hands were shaking.  I needed a beer and a barbq.  Lo and behold, Ross was kind enough to host one that evening.  Fantastic.  I had my first beers for a full week.  Ever since Dany was here, I've been detoxing and felt surprisingly good about it.  But there's something about having long rides, a bit of golf and a barbq.  It's almost criminal NOT to have a beer.  So kudos to you Ross and Nia, the burgers were just fantastic.  I left their place at about 9:30 as riding for a couple of miles on a road with no lights in the dark is even less fun than it sounds.  I got home and got a phone call from Zsophie who is a nanny friend of Kristen's.  She asked if I wanted to come out clubbing.  What the hell, why not.    It's a saturday night.  I ain't got no job, ain't got no girl.  AND I AIN@T GOT SHIT TO DO!!  Sorry. That was "Friday" [quote from movie, maybe a bit poor]  So I went and met up with Zsophie and a couple of other random friends of hers that I didn't know.  We went to aplace in oxford called the Park End.  I'd heard bad things but I was not prepared for quite how bad it is.  I'm still not a fan of paying money just to get in the place.  They make enough cash just for drinks, but we paid our five pound entry, got the standard lecherous looks from the bouncers and wandered in.  The music was shite.  Come on.  I'm definately up for some cheese but chesney Hawk's "I am the one and only" is on the wrong line of fun cheese.  Still the 30+ year old crowd were loving it.  I could have hit the dj, he was speaking over at least 1/3 - 1/2 the songs.  It started with "Happy Birthday Bob" kind of stuff and descended into "Can we please have some more girls kissing each other on the dance floor  .. .. .. .. .. that's the stuff!" .  Yeah Nice. By this stage, I'm just grooving away and putting protective arms around some of the girls from the drunk knobjockeys who think they're one step away from John Travolta, that step being less hair and more girth.  It was at the point that the DJ asked the guys who were on the pull that night to please put their hands up.  I and the other guy in our group [who didn't understand english but could sing along to everything] were the only guys to keep our hands down.  Same went for the girls.  There were a couple of hen's nights out as well.  Let me say, these women were rougher than a bucket of dogs arseh*les.  I was starting to enjoy my night less and less.  It was at the point where the DJ then said that the girls on the dance floor had lost some sort of game and the boys won, so could they please take their underwear off!!  I've never heard anything like that before.  I didn't think I was that conservative, but apparently I am.  And you know what?  The girls actually did!!  Some of them just hoicked off their g-string there and then on the dance floor and started twirling it around their fingers on the dance floor!!    I took my leave.  Everyone stayed on but I was thoroughly cheesed out.    Oh did I mention the floor was sticky and the air was full of smoke?  I'm sure you worked that one out.  Never Ever again.  Sunday was more riding and an open air carnvial in Oxford.  yes it was full of hippies and yes they weer as high as a kite.  Still, the atmosphere was good.  The rest of the evening was just spent chilling out and taking it easy as I was still knackered from the night before, the lack of sleep and the riding.    It WAS a good weekend.  I'll just chalk Saturday up to Experience I think, nothing else.

      Well the end of my first week as a fully fledged single man.   Unsurprisingly, it was no different to last week where I had a girlfrind who was 20,000 kms away.  I have managed to keep myself busy by not smoking and actualy not drinking but instead going out with people and going for bike rides.  I haven't actually got around to the gym but that is only because I simply haven't had the free time.  So that's always a good thing.  My big buys this week was a new pair of football boots [£35] for the astroturf that I play on once a week.  In no way do I expect it to make me a better player in any way, however it will make me less of a comical player.  At the moment I start of running like Road Runner with my legs spinning in circles underneath me until my shoes finally get some grip.  There's nothing like contesting a ball to find that I'm sliding four metres past my opponent giving them a free ball.  I also got around to seeing Van Hellsing this week.  The verdict?  Absolutely Brilliant.  I was stunned as you would be by this.  I thought it would be allright, but it ended up being thoroughly entertaining.  Sure, you leave your brain at the door and there are some incredibly cheesy moments.  I chose to believe that the director intentionally made the movie this cheesy which makes the film far more entertaining than if it was all serious.  Kate Beckinsale did absolutely nothing for me thought.  Her accent was pretty poor and she was wearing very unflattering clothes the whole time.  I found hugh jackman far more attractive in his more dashing outfit of wearing just pants.  Trust me when I say I'm a lot more disturbed by this than you are.  This week, all I have planned is a couple of bike rides, a spot of golf [for the first time ever which should be fun], the occasional barbeque and watching some football [eurocup England vs France].  While it doesn't seem like much, I have no doubt it will end up taking up most of my time.  Due to not smoking, and stress over kristen and aggrivating hayfever, my sleep is absolutely shot.  No matter what time I go to bed, I am guaranteed to be up between three and five.  It's dawn here at 4:30 so I have managed to watch the sun rise for the last 4 mornings.  It's been nice, but I'll be honest, I'd rather trade it for some precious sleep which seems to be just lacking at the moment.  Thank god it's friday.

      Well there you have it.  I knew bad things come in threes.  Last week was bad enough.  It was wicked having Dany over.  I think that was fate’s way of luring me into a false sense of security.  I'm now a single man.  Having a Blogspot is a bit weird.  I like to write and I think I'm doing this just as much for my benefit as I'm not sure how many people end up reading these.  As such, I'm not sure if I ever want to go into any gory details.  I'm not so keen on writing anything too personal on the account of  1]embarrasing myself 2]embarrasing anyone else  So on this acount I'll think i'll give just a brief description.  Kristen and I have been going out for the last 4 and half years.  We hit a bit of turmoil in the last year but managed to recover if however ungracfully.  Kristen went back home and for work reasons I decided to stay on for several months.  This has managed to put too much of a strain on the relationship and it's now over.  Full stop.  I’d like to think that we'll stay friends and I guess only time will tell.  I've never met anyone who has undertood me so well.  I wonder if I ever will.  I got to admit, considering she's about 20,000kms away in Oz, I'm taking it far worse than I thought I would have.  Oh well.  Time heals all wounds [apparently] so I'll just keep that in mind.  So now it’s time for a bit of focus on myself.  While we’ve been apart from each other for the last couple of months I never really considered myself as alone.  Now I’m going to have to get used to that feeling.  It’s not very nice.  Sure, I’ve got a load of very cool friends but no-one is on “the level” with me.  I think I’ll be hitting the gym a lot more often and keeping myself particularly busy in the evenings.  I hate having regrets.  I think this is going to be one of the biggies.

      Weeeeeeeeell she's gone.  What a wicked time it was to have Dany.   I had to go to work on friday but she decided to do a bit of sightseeing around in Oxford.  Though, in truly Dany fashion, who goes site seeing in arguably the most famous university city in the world when you could go and watch the latest Harry potter movie?  Oh well.  She's her own self and I'm glad that she feels she can do exactly what the hell she wants.  Gotta love her for it.  Anyway.  I managed to make her run out of Harry and race back to abingdon so she could score a couple of free drinks at our company meeting.  We broke work early to go to one of the local hotels.  We were told that the company is doing well and that we need to continue to work hard.  Oh and that IT could pull their thumb out.    [Quick Rant] It really gets on my tits being hassled in IT when I think we do a good job.  If everything goes smoothly, we're not appreciated.  People think we are doing an okay job because nothing is broken.  The truth is to the non-IT people out there.  If nothing is broken and everything is smooth as silk then IT are working their arses to the grind stone to make sure you don't notice they're doing a good job.  [sigh] Some people, especially management, don't seem to pick that up.  Oh well.  Live and learn.  Anyhoo.  We break at 5 and we know we've got about a solid hour of drinking before we get kicked out.  I thought I did a pretty good effort of managing to knock back 5 [imperial] pints and a baileys.  Don't know where the bailey's came from, someone just handed it to me.  I thought it was a sound effort.  Dany managed to make it at half five and fit in a couple of pints as well.  It was all good times.  I thought it was particularly humorous when I came across a couple of the line[not senior] managers having a bit of a gloss over my sister.  Due to us not looking anything like each other they didn't make the connection.  I went up and was talking to them, they asked who the new "hot bird" was.  I'm not a huge fan of either of these people and had great delight in slowly smiling, looking them in the eye and with a casual air quitely told them "That there is my sister and if you keep looking at her the way you are, I'm going to break you're f*cking legs."  My smile never dropped for an instant, their faces on the other hand, did.  You don't get many glorious moments like that in life.  So from the hotel we wandered down to our house [10 minute walk] and one of the ladies who was only just more sober than us managed to cook up a mexican feast of nachos, refried beans, fajitas and all the other stuff which is the same food but just folded differently.  I tell you.  If you've had five pints in an hour, chuck a couple more on top of that, a nice home cooked mexican goes a long way.  Kirsty if you're reading this, that was FAB!!  Paul R, my flat mate, decided to leave us early that evening [in fact right after the meal] to go into town.  Apparently there was a chance of him picking up [a lass or three]and he was OUT of there!!  Not the most super sociable of characters.  oh well.  So we kept drinking and watched some dvds that my sister brought with her. Class.  Saturday was a bit slow with us just milling about taking it easy.  At about 12 we decided it was time to wander off to Bath.  Bath has to be one of my most favourite cities in England.  This place has not changed in the last 200 years I swear.  It's picturesque and gorgeous.  If I were american I'm sure I would have used the term "Quaint" several times in quick succession.  As beautiful as it is, there's not a HUGE amount to do apart from walk around and say "My isn't this q****t and picturesque."  We shared a couple of nice cornish pasties and took in the local ambience.  I think the highlight was wandering into the jane Austen Museum [this is the city she grew up in] and listening to some lass wander in and ask why they didn't have a copy of "Little Women".  I thought the sweet girl behind the counter did a magnificent job of Saying "I'm afraid that Jane Austen didn't write Little Women and it is in fact an american book."  I think I would have given something a little more cutting.  That night was our big night on town.  Dany, myself, flatmates and co wandered into town [abingdon] quite late and went to Grapes.  Grapes is NOT one of my favourite places to go to on a night out.  I find it full of forty years olds trying to pick up some "meat" and the alcohol is severely overpriced to compensate for the late license it has.  Well, we wandered in and decided to get totally smashed.  I think one of the highlights was wandering in to the gents to find all the urinals packed.  I'm the first in the queue and am loudly encouraging everyone to squeeze out what they can as my back teeth were floating.  The guy behind me could wait though and with a "F*ck this" under his breath proceeded to go over and piss in the ONLY sink available.  NIiiiiice.  Oh yeah.  It's going to be a while 'til I go there again I think.  After being suitably inebriated we were off and I introduced Dany to the classic and obligatory Kebab.  I've had arguments with people here about how good English kebabs are.  Everyone agrees that they are disgusting and you wouldn't want one sober.  BUT the fact they are so gross makes them nice when you're drunk EVEN THOUGH you fully appreciate how bad they are even then.  It's a perverted logic and I find I get a headache when I think about it.  What can I say though?  I thought the kebab was so bad it was good.  That or the several pints in me thought the same thing.  Sunday itself was very quiet with everyone having massive hangovers.  The highlight was Paul H [other flat mate] cooking up a massive roast for us all as they took pity on Dany not having eaten properly for the last 7 weeks.  It was huge and had EVERYTHING you could want from chicken to roast potatoes to yorkshire pudding to stuffing to gravy so think you have to spoon it out.  YUMMY  I dropped Dany off that afternoon and went home to sleep off the fomer couple of days.  Happy days all around.  It was brilliant to see my sister.  It's obvious that we care so much for each other and I never doubted it for a second.  Sometimes I tend to get a little lonely up in england.  While I have great and wonderful friends here, they're not my family nor the people I grew up with.  Still, it just makes you appreciate everyone even more.

      Well, Dany has been here for a couple of days now.  It's been brilliant.  She's as cool as she ever was.  She arrived on wednesday evening.  I picked her up and we went for a couple of beers at one of the scenic pubs in Abingdon.  This is the Nag's Head.  Probably the most expensve pub in oxford, but it's basically on it's own island in the middle of the thames and is just glorious when the suns out.  So it's pretty much worth the extra 20p a pint.  Over Dinner we talked about old times and it came out that I wrote to one of her ex-boyfriends ridiculing him for the way he treated my sister.  Honestly, this guy was laaaaaame and he treated my sister like .. .. .. .. well not respectfully in any sense of the word.  Dany didn't know about this and I think it reassured her to know that as her little brother I will always be protective of her.  If you don't see anyone for a couple of years, it's easy for your perception of them to differ.  After a casual beer we went back for a nice curry at my local curry hut, the Balti House.  We then went back to the nag's head to continue our drinking and introduce Dany to Paul and Paul, my other flat mates.  A nice calming evening all around.  The next day, Dany and I had a sleep in 'til about 9:30.  Very relaxing.  She's currently sharing my room.  She's in the inflatable mattress which has managed to take up ALL of my floor space. Still.  I can't say it bothers me to have my sister there.  Although I was a bit upset to be told the next morning that I need to see a dentist about my teeth grinding.  :- )  We were supposed to be on the road nice and early but we didn't end up leaving until midday as we were too busy downloading songs in preparation of her 30th birthday party coming up next month.  Going through listening to Peter Allens - Rio is quite a lot of fun.  It's dampered somewhat by a totally tone def sister but her enthusiasm does make up for it.  We ended up going out to stonehenge for a look.  For my description please see an earlier blog entry.  They're big rocks.  'Nuf said.  We also went to the white horse.  I live in the vale of the white horse district.  This is taken from the picture of a white horse that has been made by digging into a hill until only chalk is coming through.  This was done rougly 3000 years ago.  The view from the hill is absolutely gorgeous.  It's a shame that you can't actually see the horse probperly due to the shape of the hill.  The best way is with a plane.  Oh well.  That evening, I took dany for one of the worst meals in Oxford I've ever had the displeasure of eating.  A quick noodle bar, I asked for scezchuan chicken with noodles and received a pound of salty chicken skin on rice.  I was just flabbergasted.  Moving swiftly on, we went to the eagle and child and Dany can now say she drank in the pub where part of Lord of teh Rings and the Narnia Chronicles were written.  I offer nothing but glamour and class I'm telling you :- ).  And today.  Well, it's a friday and I'm back at work.  Fortunately we have a company meeting which is following by complimentary drinks for an hour.  Ever wondered how many pints of lager you can fit in any hour?  If it's free and your under pressure 4 is certainly possible.  I've done 5 but I'd rather not go down that route again.  This will be closely followed by some authentic mexican fajitas and burritos cooked by one of the girls at work.  This dinner party will consist of about 12 people.  At my fathers request I will get around to include a photo that may or may not include me but won't have my flat mate Paula s he's sick of looking at thim and would like to see some local "tottie".  Love ya Dad.

      Some days, you get the vibe.  Some days you think that you really could make a difference and things will go your way.  I was under the impression that this one of those days.  I knew japan and Enlgand were having a friendly match.  I thought I might have a quiet wager at ladbrokes.  Ladbrokes were offering odds of 4/9 on England winning.  Not great odds but that was because England were very much expected to smash Japan.  I did my research for who was playing and injuries.  All was looking peechy keen.  I made a hefty sized bet at ladbrokes and then proceeded to watch Japan draw with England in what was a thoroughly dull match.  Did I lose a little bit?  Well, I've never bet so much money in my life.  Going on recent prices in australia provided by my mother, I could buy over 160 hours in the David Jones car park with it.  And I managed to piss it up against the wall.  Oh well.  Nothing ventured nothing gained.  I think there was the start AND the end to my career as a professional gambler.  But you've got to give it a wirl at least once in your life right?  To top that off I found out that the company I ordered a computer game off, a month and a half ago, has decided to shut up shop and not be contactable.    Brilliant.  I'm waiting for the third bad thing to happen.  I'm picking up my sister tonight who has been travelling for the last couple of months.  I'm very much looking forward to her coming.  I saw her two months ago when I was in australia, but I haven't seen her for three years prior to that.  Pretty scary to think about.  We have a WHOLE lot to catch up on.  Should be brilliant.  I'm sure I'll have a reasonably amount to write about after she leaves.  It should be great fun!!!  I will be taking tomorrow off to show her some of the locaaaaaal sites around here. [queue the archers them music]  She is NOT the third bad thing to happen to me.  I'm sure it will happen before now and this afternoon.  [sigh]  Bring on the good times.

      Today has decided to be a little pearler as weather goes.  I was really worried over the last couple of weeks that summer has decided to leave us but in the last week, the weather has had bouts of beautiful sunshine.&nbsp; It's absolutely stunning outside now and I'm thinking that my thick wool t-shirt today is not the wisest of moves [as trendy as it may look].&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I'll change at lunch.  Aarrrgh the beauty of living close to work.  There's no real news or anything, I just thought I'd dribble a bit about my current fitness.&nbsp; Much to Kristen's annoyance, I would sit on my arse for several months doing nothing but skinning up but when I decided to go for a jog I would then do 3kms without too much strain.  I'm not sure which part of my family I got my health from, but I do count myself lucky that I tend to be pretty fit normally.&nbsp; I may not be lean and cut but I can run faster and longer than most people.&nbsp;   Over the last couple of weeks I have tried to improve this by actually getting more proactive.&nbsp; The fact that the weather is so beautiful is just more of an incentive to do things.  This is one of the beautiful aspects of England.&nbsp; When the sun is out, you appreciate it so much more and feel&nbsp;the need to do something.&nbsp; So I'll be playing my regular wednesday game of football tonight.&nbsp; While I'm no Beckam, I at least am running back and forth and can prove a pretty effective wall.&nbsp;&nbsp; Things get kinda messy if I lose focus and start treating it a bit like AFL at home though.&nbsp; Apparently, you can't actually hip and shoulder people.&nbsp; And climbing their back for a header is a definate NoNo .. .. .. .. .. .. .. or so I'm told.&nbsp; Crazy Brits.  Apart from the football, I tend to be playing a couple of rounds of golf a week as well.&nbsp; Nothing special, just a pitch and put which is to say a 9 hole par 3 course.&nbsp; You can do it in about an hour.&nbsp; If the weather is good, it's a glorious way to spend in the sun.&nbsp; Not very strenuous in any way, but very enjoyable.  I also managed to go indoor rock climbing this week.  Before I left Australia, I had a list of last things that I wanted to do in Adealide with my friends and family.&nbsp; It's funny, I can hardly remember what was on the list.&nbsp; There was somethingl ike 15 items but I'm buggered if I remember what half of them were.  I DO know that one of them was to go indoor rock-climbing which I did.&nbsp; It was just brilliant fun.&nbsp; I couldn't have enjoyed it anymore.&nbsp; Nothing like using your body to do things that it's not used to.&nbsp; A friend of mine [Hello US Claire] mentioned that there is an indoor rock climbing place at Brookes university.&nbsp; So we got together and she gave me a tour.&nbsp; Fantastic stuff.&nbsp; We were there for about an hour and a half.&nbsp; I didn't get on the ropes.&nbsp; I just did the bouldering which is climbing the wall about 4 metres high with no support.&nbsp; Well, apart from the foot thick mattress that the place is covered in.&nbsp; I couldn't believe that half an hour into it, I was just drenched with sweat.&nbsp; It's strenuous but I didn't remember sweating that badly before.&nbsp;   Will try and make it a regular thing I think.&nbsp; Good clean fun and somthing to add to the weekly list of things to try and fit in.  Long Live the Summer.

      So yes, it was yet another cocktail party on the weekend.&nbsp; This time it was at our house and therfore on our terms.  The only problem with a cocktail party is you have to actually organise the thing properly and tell people what to bring, otherwise they all bring bottles of vodka.&nbsp; There's only so many variations of vodka and ice you can have, so a bit of organisation was needed.&nbsp; Paul, Debs and myself put a list of about 22 people together for the nights drinks and the price was pretty much a bottle a head.&nbsp; it may seem a bit excessive, but last cocktail party we ran out of booze and I'm not going through that again. [shudder]  So we got about £30 [AUS$75] worth of mixers to go with all the alcohol and a couple of blenders to make sure we could get through it all.  The verdict?  A raging success.&nbsp; The night consisted of  Cocktails: Black/White russions Blue Lagoons Fruit Fizz Yellow Submarine Caparinia WooWoos [my personal favourite, Vodka, Peach schnapps and cranberry juice]  BushWackers Mudslide  Shots: Cowboy Cocksuckers Cunnilingus Small Guiness'  Well.&nbsp; That was what we were supposed to be making.&nbsp; I kept to the format pretty well as I was the main cocktail maker for the first couple of hours.&nbsp; But I got tired and wanted to chat to some more friends who had just come in, so I left it.&nbsp; I got about two steps when someone said that knew a great cocktail and reached for the baileys and blue caracao.  I did NOT want to try the result and ran.  Casualties for the night?&nbsp; Well, for once we didn't break a glass.&nbsp; The Satan glasses were everyones favourites to drink from for the night.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; Apart form the plastic peanut bowl the Paul and Debs got me for a cocktail drink.&nbsp; Very messy.  However, we did have one broken chair and a number of scorche marks&nbsp;"through" the carpet.&nbsp; Mental note.&nbsp; Don't break out the sheesha when the only people using it are going to be pissed out of their brain.&nbsp; Hot Coal and cheap carpet are not the best of friends.&nbsp; That might be a bit tricky to explain to the mangement, but I'm sure we can blag it.  I don't want to even talk about the state of the Kitchen.&nbsp; It was akin to a sweet sticky Chenobyl.  We managed to go through: 3.5 bottles of kahlua 3 bottles of peach schnapps 1 bottle of butterscotch schnapps 2 bottles of baileys 1 bottle of blue caracao 1 bottle of cechaca 1 litre of gin 5 LITRES of vodka.  So yes.&nbsp; A good night.&nbsp; I can wait a little until our next cocktail party I think.

      Well, I've gone a bit ebay crazy over the last couple of weeks.  I've picked up some great deals for books and dvds and all kinds of sh*t.&nbsp; I'm loving it.  However, I have just removed the site from my favourites list.&nbsp; It's come that time again where I'm going a little bit "too" crazy.&nbsp; A bit of rest is needed.&nbsp; Unfortunately, a quick 5 minutes to scan for any new books/cards/dvds usually results in some impulse buying.&nbsp; One or two impulses is enough.&nbsp; 5 or 6 is waaaaay bad though.  So I'm going to have to stop for the next couple of months.&nbsp; I've got some travelling and a car to save up for, so I'll just have to focus on that.  In the mean time, I've picked up&nbsp;my "Best of the Muppet Show" DVD.&nbsp; It consist of 28 muppet episodes.&nbsp; That's right, we're looking at 12 hours of&nbsp;Ms Piggy going "Hay-Ya!!!"!&nbsp; So I'm going to watch an episode each lunch time to unwind nicely.  You can never get fozzie, animal, beaker or swedish chef in my books.  Happy f*cking Days.

      Well that's it.  I've now cracked my 2000 songs on my hard drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy days.&nbsp; I actually cracked it yesterday and didn't even notice!  So, I can hear you all with baited breath wondering what was the 2000th song I&nbsp;downloaded onto my machine.  Well, it's not too embarassing, pretty cool actually I have to say.  My 2000th song was "Can I kick it" - By a Tribe Called Quest.  So now, it's looking up and see what I can now get.&nbsp; Hmmmm.&nbsp; 3000 songs?  And still no Rolf Harris to be seen.  Phew.  So Can I kick it?  Yes You Can.

      My flat mate Paul was in NewCastle this weekend just gone for a big stag do of a friend.  Apparently there were a lot of boys out and good times were had by all.&nbsp; When I asked about the strip clubs [which is almost an obligatory thing to ask someone whose been on a bucks night], he replied that they didn't get to it that night because half the guys got banned when they went at 2 that afternoon.  Must have been a very full day for some.  Anyway, Paul told me a great story which he swears is true.  On Saturday afternoon all the boys were in the boozer talking about whether they had pulled the night before.&nbsp; From what I gathered they had spent the friday night in a couple of pubs in areas of ill repute where it's easier to pull a woman then a tooth out of a dead horse.&nbsp; So there were all kinds of stories bouncing around the table.  One of the boys came up with this: "Well, I got with some lass and managed to con her into taking me back to her place.&nbsp; We had a couple of more drinks and decided to get off there and then.&nbsp; We were both enjoying a bit of the old forplay and I started playing with her arse.&nbsp; She was a bit "oh no no, not there", but after a while she was all for it so I took her up the bum."  At this point Paul asked him if he had never met this girl before.&nbsp; "Nope".&nbsp;   So Paul asks "So did you wear anything?", talking about protection.  The guy turns and tells him with a perfectly straight face, "Yeah.&nbsp; My socks."  I nearly fell out of my chair laughing.

      So I’ve managed to complete a two day course in Jboss Administration.&nbsp; The instructors weren’t too happy at the end of the course when they asked if we had any final questions.&nbsp; I stuck my hand up and pointed out that they’ve explained how to install, configure, fix, cluster deploy etc….. the software but not actually what the hell it does.&nbsp; I wasn’t expecting quite the cold attitude I received.  Then again, the instructors were German.&nbsp; It probably wasn’t efficient to let me know during the course.  &nbsp;  So apart from the bloody difficult course, the hotel I decided to stay in wasn’t much better.&nbsp; I was told that the company would pay for expenses but to try and keep it on the cheap-ish side.&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp; I found a hotel that would set me back about £26.&nbsp; I forgot that this means NOTHING in London.&nbsp; My single sh*ty bedroom was cracked and the window wouldn’t close properly.&nbsp; I’m not sure which was my favourite part, finding that my ensuite was in fact the whole floors bathroom AND it’s only soap was so mouldy it could have been blue cheese; OR finding lots of hairs in my bed when I pulled the dooner back meaning the bed had been made but the sheets not changed.  &nbsp;  Real Quality.  &nbsp;  But you put up with it.&nbsp; It was worth it [almost] for the rest of the weekend.&nbsp; I caught up with a great Australian friend in London, Kerry.&nbsp; Top bloke.&nbsp; He’s one of those guys that you instantly are relaxed around and feel confident in yourself because he wouldn’t expect anything less from you.&nbsp; Really sound guy.&nbsp; It’s always too long between seeing each other.  &nbsp;  He is also one of the craziest drinkers I think I’ve ever seen.  I was hoping to have a quieter weekend with him after the last weekend.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  No such luck.  &nbsp;  I met him at his work, the BBC, and we went into one the bars in there for some decent priced beers.&nbsp; By the time we left, we were ticking over nicely.&nbsp; We met Kerry’s new girlfriend, Merrily, and another couple at Belgo which is a special Belgium restaurant in Covent Garden.&nbsp; Sitting down with some great surf’n’turf and a couple of glasses of Duval [9%] later, we were ticking over nicely.&nbsp; The girls wanted something sweet for desert.&nbsp; I’m not such a big fan of sweets when I’m drinking so I let Kerry talk me into have a depth charge which involved putting a shot glass of gin in another duval.  It’s at this point things started to get untidy.  &nbsp;  We scraped ourselves up and walked over to the Lowlander which is a Dutch/Belgium pub also in Covent garden.&nbsp; Among the beers consumed were SATAN.&nbsp; Tasted so bad it was good.&nbsp; Also, it came in with glasses with SATAN imprinted on them.&nbsp; Fantastic.&nbsp; Well, I had to get a couple just for myself didn’t I?&nbsp; You can’t give up an opportunity like that.  &nbsp;  I’d like to thank Kerry for letting me keep them as well.&nbsp; As he pointed out, he can get more whenever he needs.  &nbsp;  Saturday morning was a bit slower but by the time it was midday I had made a move into the centre of London.&nbsp; I decided it was time for a musical and made it to see Phantom of the opera.&nbsp; This is the first time that I went and saw an opera that I had already once seen before.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  --aside--  I took an old girlfriend to see it when it was being performed in Adelaide.&nbsp; It was one of those crazy big events that I organised for my first love.&nbsp; Funny.&nbsp; It was the first big thing I’d ever organised for someone I really care about.&nbsp; I still remember that on Thursday 20th March 1997, I picked Debb up at 5:40 at her place; took her to the ritziest restaurant in Adelaide [Lenzerheide]; then it was off to the theatre for Phantom.&nbsp; We were FRONT row a little bit on the side; after that it was to the Grande in Glenelg for a beach view and a beautiful night in.&nbsp; It was a very special time for me [and I like to think Her].&nbsp; Funny how some things won’t leave your mind, no matter how long ago they were.  --End of Aside—  &nbsp;  Well, I can easily say that the Australian production was a MILLION times better.&nbsp; Everything was superior, from the acting to the lighting and sound.&nbsp; I still enjoyed it very much and was definitely entertained, but it was interesting to compare it to what a fresh group of performers in Australia would do.  &nbsp;  After that, I went and did some discount shopping at French Connection with Kerry, picking up some nice clothes and then went to Merrily’s house for a cocktail party.  &nbsp;  What was it like?&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; I convinced Merrily the night before to get a blender for the cocktails.&nbsp; We did all kinds of crazy drinks, starting with Melon Margaritas and then WooWoos.&nbsp; Eventually, it came down to doing everything and then making up some more new cocktails.&nbsp; I think I managed to excel.&nbsp; With the aid of Kerry’s mate, Robo who came up with the names we did the following drinks:  &nbsp;  Purple People Eater: Casis, Vodka, Peach Schnapps, Lemonade  Yellow Submarine: Vodka, Gin, bacardi, passion fruit juice  White Christmas: Coconut Milk; Rum ; Peach Snaps.  &nbsp;  All of the above included Ice.  &nbsp;  Fortunately, every cocktail included a great deal of ice.&nbsp; This meant that while we got pretty damn toasted that evening we were continually being hydrated.&nbsp; End product?&nbsp; No hangover whatsoever.&nbsp; We went to bed at about 4 and were up again at 9 cleaning up without any sore heads.&nbsp; Happy days.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Still.&nbsp; Sunday was a VERY long day of me waking up and helping clean up Merrily’s flat.&nbsp; Then it was a way long haul home to find that Debb’s was kind enough to cook up a big f*ck off dish of fish and potato.&nbsp; While the food was good, I felt very guilty as I managed to miss the name of a great friends’ first child.&nbsp; I’m sorry Neil.&nbsp; I left at the first good opportunity and it was still [way] too late.&nbsp; London is a horrible place to get in and out of at any time, but if there’s a reason to get out/in, you’re in trouble.

      Well,  I've been looking at tuxedoes online for this wedding I'm going to in October.  I got to admit, I'm getting well excited.  There's so many things to look forward to.  I'm going to see my family, my friends and see two very special people make public their true love for each other.  Happy Days.  I've never been to a wedding before.  My family isn't big and I don't have crazy friends that want to tie the knot at 18 so this if my first chance to go.  So what to wear?  My parents have talked me out of the poweder blue top hat and tails with matching frilly shirt and the mandatory silver tipped cane.  I think I can only go wearing that if my accompanying partner would be wearing a bowl of fruit for a hat [carmen miranda style].  As I'm going solo I better put a bit more class into it.  So the dates for my flights are, arriving on saturday 23/10/2004 and leaving again on tuesday 02/10/2004.  I come back to heathrow at 6 in the morning and will be starting work that day as I haven't got any more time off.  Oh that should be grand fun.  It's not a long stay so I'm going to try and make the most of it.  I have no plans of going home after that for .. .. .. well .. .. a while so it's going to be pretty non stop really.    Sweeeeeet.

      Well, what an intersting weekend.  - Three leaving Do's - A birthday - A trip to the Oxford Rowing Club - A sunday Roast at a very nice pub - A DVD rip of Shrek 2 - Playing pool at a cheesy pub - Finding the first decent Kebab shop in England  What do they all have in common?  They were used as excuses for some drinking.  My god.  I think I managed to knock back over 30 pints [+] this weekend.  Euuuugh.  Of course.  This all came around because it was planned to have a nice relaxing weekend with the occasional beer.  Oh well.  So yes.  It was a very good weekend, but I've the got a hangover which is the accumulation of three days worth of drinking right now.  Currently, reality isn't a fun place.  It's full of very loud noises and bright lights.  I managed to only fit in a single trip to the gym.  But I did a 7 k run in just over 40 minutes which I though was pretty tops.  So I'll see if can try and keep up that standard.  I didn't get around to the gym this morning.  Far to scary an idea.  Will hopefully get there tonight.  Yeah Right :- )

      So the boys and I rock up for our weekly testosterone orientated football match.  This will be the second time I get to try out my fancy new football boots on the astro turf.  I'm still crap at the game, but thankfully I have a little bit of pace.  It would be handy if I could somehow turn my name into something a little more awe inspring on the pitch. A friend of mine, Naveed, is called Navaldo and then you have the great Wayne Rooney and Roonaldo.  Somehow Keiraaaaaldo doesn't quite inspire the terror I want to see in peoples faces.  Instead it's more of a sympathetic and pitiful look.  Will have to work on the name I think.  We managed to play for the full hour.  Now I must remind you that it is MID summer here.  So what was the weather like?  What else?  It was pissing it down.  For the FULL HOUR.  Of course, when we stopped playing, so did the f*cking rain, but you'd expect it wouldn't you.    After the first half-hour of game play, a friend, Ross, took his water proof jacket off because water was creeping in the neck and sleeves and not being able to escape.  So in effect it was drier if he took the damn coat off.  It was at this point I was wondering if anyone had a convenient Ark anywhere on their person.  Such is british Summer.  It's not nearly as good as last year, but when the sun comes out you make the most of it.  I've been going to the gym in the mornings still.  I've cut 5km jogs down to 28 minutes which is good.  I'll try and extend the length I jog now instead improving my pace as I want to burn the fat more.  However now that I'm fas free, I'm finding my afternoons are much free-er than they used to be.  So I've been going on bike rides and long walks along the river.  So when the sun does come out I find myself literally walking through fields of Gold [sorry Sting for using such a cheesy line].  Just picturesque.  Next time, I'll take my camera and show you what I mean.  I have put up a picture of a night out from the last week.  These are two great friends of mine, Bushra and Phil, both from work who know how to enjoy themselves.    I have forgotten to take my camera out the last couple of weeks hence the lack of photoes.  Apologies.  There are some decent parties coming up this weekend and I hope to get some great shots.  I have also changed the feedback on the website so now anyone whose reading can leave some feedback.  This could backfire so nothing too vicsous or I'll jsut take it straight off :- ).  Otherwise, let me know what's going on out there people!!

      I don't beleive it.  I just CAN'T BELIEVE IT.  So I've been looking around for a car.  The little red beast of a nissan Micra has done it's country proud and it's reliable as anything.  However, it's not much of a beast; comfort factor isn't there and having only the radio drives me mad.  Did I mention British Radio plays the worst Pop Crap in the world?  So I'm looking about.  I think I'll try and get my hands on a Toyota Celica. I'm not sure, but probably the 2.0 Gt turbo.  Bit of grunt and something stylish.  I've found a couple of different versions and ages that are out there and I think they look pretty sweet.  I have no doubt that it doesn't agree with all the boys back home.  It's a V6/V8 or it ain't nothing.. .. .. .. apparently.  God sometimes I wish I can understand car talk.  I'm not buying anything brand new, I've been there and done that.  Not going to get burned again and lose a shed load of money when I sell it off.    So I've found a nice car.  First things first, I'll check out what the damage is with insurance.  Upon my first phone call I get some pretty decimating news.  I've been driving in the country for the last 18 months TOTALLY illegaly.  I've already gone on to the British Driving License Website and I have to admit, they do make it quite clear.   If you are resident for more than 12 months in the UK, you MUST apply for a full british drivers license.  I've been driving for 9 years, my [Oz] license is valid for 7 more years.  This doesn't amount to squat.  I have to retake a theory test and then do the physical exam.   That's not the best bit.  If I don't stretch the truth and say that maybe I have come here in the last year, I'm going to have to go back onto my "L"s. :-)    If it wasn't happening to me, I'd be pissing myself with laughter.  So that's it.    No more driving for me until I can get this all sorted.  I should look on the bright side and be happy that nothing has actually happened.  Then again.  I hate people who look on the bright side of things.

      Phew.  Another weekend come and gone.  What a weekend though!  Just fantastic.  Things were great.  While as weekends go, it was fun and lots of fun,  it was such a good weekend because NOTHING went wrong!!  It’s been a long time since something like that happened.    I ended up going out on the Friday night with a couple of friends that grew up in Faaaaaaaaringdon with Debbie [flat mate] which was class.  I was supposed to meet up with more people from work but I couldn’t be arsed going to them in their seedy club and they couldn’t be arsed seeing me in the classy pub that I was in.  Oh well.  I had way too much to drink and there were good times all around.  We end up getting back at some obscene time.  I am the only one that holds off from having a Kebab [be proud] and am woken up at 8:30 by a mate who reminds me that I have to help him move house.  Who calls up at 8:30 on a Saturday morning??  That morning involved work which was okay.  A bit of extra cash can never go astray.  It was topped by playing Risk with some great mates.  Thankyou Phil, Bush and Ross.  There’s something pretty primal about plans for world domination, drinking beer, dribbling shit, eating Pizza and smoking Jasmin Flavoured tobacco.  It’s just such a class combination.    Bushra was kind enough to bring me back a proper Sheesha [nagile] from Dubai.  I still have some tobacco spare from Kristen’s and my trip to turkey.  It’s great stuff.  Very relaxing.  Sunday was exercise with some gym; some riding and some golf.  Pretty chilled out all around.  Sat  back that night to watch Greece beat Portugal.  I’m sure you’re reading this Mr WillieThePimp.  Congratulations on winning, but it was still a dull game.  I wasn’t quite ready for bed so gave a look over my flatmates PS2 games.  I tried something called manhunt.  I couldn’t believe it.  There is no plot [that I gather] and the whole point of the game [so far] is to go around and kill people as gruesomely as possible [you get a star rating].  You can use plastic bags, glass shards and baseball bats so far.  Let me say.  It IS gruesome and surprisingly fun.  Hmmmmmm.  Not good.  I also caught the last half hour of Kingdom Hospital.  I don’t know if anyone else has seen this. I quite enjoy it. It’s supposed to be based on a Stephen King Novel.  A hospital is built over the site of a tragic fire where lots of children died, so the hospital is now haunted.  Yeah I know.  Original.  Still. I find it very compelling and recommend it [form a safe distance].   My Big news however is that I WILL be coming back to Australia .. .. .. AGAIN this year!!  I’ve booked the tickets and will be coming back to see Alex and Gareth get married.  Oh Happy Days.  I was really upset that I missed out on Debb’s and I’m not sure how I would take it missing out on another wedding of such a close couple.  So happy days a head.  I think if I work hard, I will just about lose enough weight by then so that I can regain it all with some of Mum’s Cooking :- )  I’m looking at arriving on the 23/10/04 and leaving again on the 2/11/04!!  Happy Days.

      Well, I'm nearly there.  I've just about cracked two thousand songs on my laptop.    Through talking with people and sharing the songs that we cough-cough made backups of, from our orginals, I have now a range of music that will hopefully be able to cope with almost any party situation.  But I'm struggling for the last one hundred songs to be able to crack the two ton.  I'm sure something will come up.  If anyone has any suggestions of any music that would be great.  Before you write however, NO I do not want decent Chinese Card Music nor stuff from Cannibal Corpse.  Anything more chilled out is definately required.  I'm managed to come across a couple of bands recently that are very VERY cool and relaxed.  If anyone has a chance to listen to Tryo - Acoustic Reggae, definately take it.  It's a french band that is all about acoustic guitars and sweet harmonics.  Pretty mad.  I've also come across Manu Chao.  A french guy who went to Cuba and fell in love with the place and stayed.  Again, no english songs, but this is all about the rhythm.  Wicked for any tropical evenings you may want to have.  I got around to playing my first game of football yesterday with my new boots.  The verdict?  Both my cheeks are sore [fortunately not swollen].  I took two tumbles and manage to fall on a different cheek each time.  If you saw me walking, it's like I'm imitating a giraffe going for a drink.  Falling on astroturf is similar to falling on concrete but with less sand.  Nothing like sand in your vicous scrapes.  But that's okay, the girls swoon when I say I picked these scars from Charlie in Vietnam.  Still, I could actually keep up with people.  Oh I'm still crap at the game but at least it's more like a game of football and less like pinball with me sliding everywhere.  My sleep is still pretty bad at the moment.  i'm trying to do a bit of exercise at night so I can just collapse into bed and not dream.  It seems to be working with me only a waking up a couple of times during the night.  Whoever thought being drug free would cause so much hassle :- ).  I hope to try and not drink this weekend.  I haven't got any plans [as a trip to Normandy recently fell through].  So I might come into work and get some extra cash instead.  I have some more extensive travel plans coming up and I think the cash will be well needed for this.  When I've booked this, I'll let you all know.
