      looks like my week is cursed. it started sunday, out of nowhere, im trying to boost my laptop's speed by cleaning the recycle bin, defragmenting and doing all systems checkup. in between reboots, since i have a BIOS password, i decided to remove the password later on. then the worst happened, i cannot open the computer with the password, damn! i then thought of the CMOS battery coz that's what i usually do in desktop PCs. i looked for my screwdriver & opened the screws 1 by 1 just to found out that i cannot open this one, it's too risky. that's the start of my calvary.   monday came. i then realized it's hard to last a day in the office without me touching the keyboard of my laptop. No matter how hard i tried, still i can't get it out of my system.  by night tinme, when most of my officemates were gone, I was then able to search the problem of my laptop & email the necessary contacts for answers.  now, its already tuesday & i havent touched my computer, damn! i feel very empty, as if im walking on a shallow ground. i feel very light though very heavy deep inside.  tomorrow will be another day and i dont even expect any excitement to come along my way. wish i have Len by myside. i really need her during these times. wish she knew how much i missed her. Love you baby! mwah

      Thursday, June 17, 2004  Here I go again, procastinating again. Wasting my precious time chatting with people i dont really know nor care about. At one time Im very eager doing things and making them happen. But then at another instance, here i am, hanging everything as if i have all the tme in the world. wish i could make things happen in a snap of a finger. but sorry for me, that's not the way life goes.  yesterday was one tiring yet fulfilling day for me? wonder y? well, we met yesterday. at first i tot it would lead to another disastrous day, but my prayers we're heard. as soon as i wrap her around my arms, those beautiful smile kept pouring from her lips.  we're suppose to watch the movie of aga and kristine hermosa (i'm a big fan of aga, though no one knows about it) but since it's not playing anymore, we settled for 'chronicles of riddick' instead. though she's not a big fan of action movies, i know she enjoyed our stay at the cinema in between those laughter and teaser that we usually give each other aside from the giggles while secretly peeping at our seatmates whom are not watching but rather giving each other the treatment of a lover, hehe.   i could say that she changed a bit. a kind of change that i like. now we talk some more, dealing with politics and problems that we encounter in the past like her jealousy that are mostly the topics of many fights. i like it when we feel comfortable talking about everything. of course she can't win with my arguments, that's why she's always pissed a the end.  by 7.30 im already home. i was alone for a moment until my roomate came. by 12 im already sleeping my butts from a day of working and strolling.   tom will be friday again, my worst day of the week. see yah!

      friday again. it's akward that i don't like friday wherein to some people, friday is the best day since its the end of the whole week's work. well that doesnt work for me. they say im a workaholic, perhaps i really do. well u cant blame me, i need to work hard to make me worth of my job.  about her, well, we're still not "A" ok. last night we had this little conversation 'AGAIN'. the whole day we didnt text. then i called her. she's with her friends and she seems happy not being bothered by me. i then texted her telling my sentiments. then, that's the start.  this morning, out of nothing, i texted her saying that im on my way to the office. that i love her and that she need not to reply. but then she replied telling me she love me so much. sigh* what a relief.  have to go now, we still have a billiard session with my officemates.  june 11, 2004

      last night we had PHP tutorial lessons, didnt learn much though. the topics are very basic. needed a little more advance, mysql perhaps.  she texted me before she slept, but i know she's not yet ok. sigh* how I wish I could see her and comfort her. i know its my fault, but i have no bad intentions of not letting her know that i know her bestfriends cellphone number. i just wanna surprise her on her upcoming birthday...  hope we'd be ok now.

      today is june 9, nothing so special. we had a fight last night. my fault though. i thought she'd never find out that i know her friends cell number. then the worst happened. she found out. she said she's ok now, but i know she's not. she still have it inside her.

      just got here in the office. guess what, just did what i've been planning to do ages ago - apply for a passport... whew, now i can say i finally did it..   it's been almost months since i first planned on applying for one, the first was january, then came february.. and now, it's already july and i finally did the deed.. hehe.  here's how the story goes. last night, i set up my alarm at 4:30am coz i was planning to leave by 5am. but then again, it turned out that its already 5:10 when i heard the alarm so i was thinking, will i still go or not. still lazy in my bed, had to stand up, go to the bathroom and there, by 5.30, im off to the DFA. i never thought that the line would be that long, as early as 6.30, i think im at the 300th line. i just told myself, im already here so no sense in backing off.   by 8am, we already moved to Step 1 (consists of 4 Steps). we had to wait 1 by 1 to get our names called. by Step 2, we're no longer in the arrangement, i was lucky to get at the front of the newly opened window. then step 3 and 4 is easy coz there aint much of a line.   so that's it, im about to receive my passport on july 22 and on August 5-8, Hongkong, here i come.. hehe  ciao!
