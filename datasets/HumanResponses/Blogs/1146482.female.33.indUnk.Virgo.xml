      Hello again friends and thank you for visiting MY NOT SO SECRET LIFE Blog.  I am trying to be mindful and not play around with my tongue piercing anymore. It’s hard because it’s just fun, but it has become a bad habit. I know it bugs people but most everyone is too nice to say. Thanks. :o)  I have been enjoying my church’s website, www.hopespringschurch.com. We have a great site administrator, he did a great job putting it together. I am hoping we utilize it more.  Last night I had my prayer night and my friends Joseph, Matt and Katrina were there. Matt broke out his present from another friend Kyle, it’s called “Matt’s Postmodern Experiential Holiness Kit” It’s an incense burner like the kind you would find in a Catholic Church. It’s cool, but I begin to want to stand up, sit down, and kneel everytime I hear a bell. That will only make sense or be funny if you have had to attend Catholic Mass. If Matt burns it just right, it smokes up the room like a Led Zepplin concert. And let me tell you, that stuff is strong!  OK, I have to share this funny pick up line I heard on a TV show. This girl walks up to this guy and says, “Are you a parking ticket? Cuz you got FINE written all over you!” I thought that was hysterical! And right now, I just heard this black comedian on BET talking about Bin Laden. She’s saying how black people make a slang out of everything. So you know how Bin Laden’s been hiding out. She says the new slang would be “Dog where you bin hidin’” To which the answer would be, “Shoot I’ve Bin Laden man.” I thought that was too funny. It loses something in the typing, and I am not quoting it exactly because I am trying to keep it clean. But this little paragraph was especial for my soul sista MJ...peace out dog...word. :oP I’m still trying for my degree in Ebonics. I just can’t seem to get the grammar right.  Joseph, my friend I mentioned early, is a regular subscriber to MY NOT SO SECRET LIFE...Hi Joseph! He said that he got offended by my using the term Black instead of say African-American in my first Blog entry. Well, Joseph...I’m sorry I offended you. But I used the term again on today’s Blog because I was directly quoting what this woman said on BET. By the way, BET stands for BLACK Entertainment Television. Funny, but they show BLACK Movies and BLACK sit-coms. Their words, not mine. :oP Just repeating it as I hear it. Love you Boo Boo. ;o)  I still don’t have hot water. I am resorting to boiling hot water for washing. I feel so frontier days. Oh so Avant Daniel Boone Garde. Maybe someday my pipes will thaw when the temps get above 30 on Superbowl Sunday.  Ok...I suppose some of you are actually expecting me to say something profound. I’m sorry. Ha ha. No just kidding.  I have been contemplating the movie “The Matrix.” Probably because I have the movie poster right in front of me. But that movie had some profound messages for me. See, The Matrix, according to the movie, is a prison you are born into that you can neither taste, nor see, nor smell, nor touch. It is a prison for your mind and we think we are free but you are really born into slavery. Our flesh. Our Prison. Paul sums it up best, “Oh wretched man that I am, who will free me from this body of death?”  I wonder what my life would be like, if I could, like Neo the hero of “The Maxtix,” realize the truth...there is no spoon. You’d have to see the movie to understand this, but in the movie, Neo is watching as a child bends a spoon using his mind. He picks up the spoon and the child tells him, “Do not try to bend the spoon, for that is impossible. Merely, try to realize the Truth.”  “The Truth?” Neo asks. The child response, “There is no spoon.” And this rings true when he sees the Maxtix for what it really is. A world bound by code, rules or..the law...whoa..Deep...and he actually sees the code that makes up the world and he is no longer bound by the code, rules, law of the world. He is free. He transcends it. I want to live in that kind of truth of who I am in Christ, what His grace truely means in my life, and how the law of sin and death is transcended because of Christ dying for me. If you have never seen, “The Matrix.” See it. Watch for these things, they are there. It’s a very deep movie.  Some of my Cali friends and family are asking if I still want to live in KY. Yes I do. While Cali is not KY, KY is not Cali. And I am glad. Sure there’s winter here, but I never knew season before living here. And just as there are seasons in the year, there are in life. I could never see this before because I never lived it. I lived with 330 days of sunshine a year. And all sunshine makes a desert. So Cal is a desert, remember? I needed to get out of the desert for awhile and feel snowflakes hit my face for a change.  One of the characters in “The Matrix” really spoke to me when he chose to believe the lie of the Matrix because it’s easier and more pleasurable. He said, “Ignorance is bliss.” Lord, never let me believe ignorance is bliss again.  Thanks for reading!

      Ok, so I didn’t get very far in re-typing my Blog entry from yesterday.  I don’t know if anything very important was lost.  Let me tell you about my recent adventure. 4 degrees! I made the stupid mistake of leaving my daggum garden hose hooked up to my house. To those of you who don’t know this (my lovely Cali friends) you never want to do that and have freezing weather come in.  I lost hot water but my cold water is still running. I tried to go to Wal-Mart to buy de-icer but they were closed!! Stupid weather. The whole town closes down. Anyway, I got a hold of Randy, my brother in law, in toasty Bonita, CA and he told me I was right to try to get that hose off here at 12:30 midnight (9:30 pm PST) and to try hot water to get the hose off. So I boiled some water and got that hose off! And, per Randy, I have every tap in my house dripping to keep the pipes from totally freezing and hopfully get my hot water back soon.  I don’t know how I avoided it, but with all that water spraying me and getting all over my hands, I don’t know how I avoided frostbite or getting frozen out there. It was like I didn’t even feel it.  So, that is my latest adventure of living in Kentucky. Incidentally, I have never experienced this kind of cold living here. This is colder than it has ever been here in the just over 3 years I have lived here. The coldest weather I have ever been in, was in Chicago, -50 with the windchill. That was with my buddy Bill.   Speaking of Bill Attinger, who lives in the Ceaser Chavez Barrio of San Diego, CA (Go check out his new children’s clothing line at Family Christian Stores...Wee Witness) he is my NFL advisor. He told me his feelings on the Superbowl and I of course whole heartedly agree, the Bucs have a special team and should beat the Raiders who (besides being the evil team of the NFL) were good enough to make the bowl but they aren’t special. And I don’t think they want it as bad as the Bucs who have never been to the big bowl until now. Bucs by 3. I’m calling it. If the odds are against them, to my betting friends, put $20 down for me, I’m good for it. :o) Also, if you question my pick, let me tell you that I chose a Bucs/Raiders Superbowl well over 2 weeks ago. And no one thought it would happen. Well, people are listening to my picks here now. Food for thought.  I am in one of the most difficult seasons of my life. It is challenging to hold on to my self-worth being in Christ when I am unemployed. I don’t know if I will get the MickyDs job and let me tell you all, I think I’ll hit a big low if I don’t get work there. I have already been humbled in having to look for work in fat I mean fast food. But I know that is what God wants. It was an area in my life that needed to be addressed. I don’t ever want to be too proud to do any kind of work. There is no shame in working hard at any job. I am still too concerned about appearences. I am glad God is teaching me such important truths, but I really really need a job! I am hopeful that the MickyDs job is mine. PT to start. But I have to lose the nose screw.  I have been recognizing all the idols in my life I am still holding onto. I am addicted to pleasure. I am a idolater because I seek things that bring me pleasure rather than God. I seek those idols when I am in pain, bored, or just to have a sense of being alive. These are all things that I should seek God about. And I don’t. As a result I have consequenses to pay that I hate. I so very much want that to change. Just thought I’d share that with all of you.  It’s late and I think its time to hit the sack. Thanks for reading. I’ll post more later.   Jer29eleven1@aol.com

      Wow  I guess the powers that be didn't want you all to read what I first wrote. My internet connection totally crashed when I tried to post it!  Let me see  I thanked all of you for visiting my blog. Many of you had kind words to say (Except for on the subject of Eminem) especially about my writing. I humbly thank you.  It may please some of you to know that I am finishing up my manuscript. Check out my next posting.

      I finally have my own piece of the WWW...welcome to my Blog Spot. First of all, I know some of you are thinking, "What does 'Blog' mean?" Well, don't ask me because I don't know.  I have the honor of sharing my testimony at Southeast Christian Church on Sat. Feb 1. If anyone is interested in attending, the seminar starts at 9 a.m. and I have no idea when I am speaking.  This week I had the opportunity to see "Gangs of New York" and "8 Mile". I love movies, I just don't have much in the way of liquid assests to go as often as I'd like. Fortunately, this town has 2 dollar matinees and a 1 and 2 dollar regular priced theater.   "Gangs" was bloody and violent but an all around good movie. It is not for the faint hearted. I know that many of my friends do not care for Leonardo...but I am indifferent. I really enjoyed the first movie I saw him in, "The Basketball Diaries", mostly because it was about a troubled poet. Being a poet, and often troubled myself, I related. I completely disagree with those who claim that movie inspired Columbine. I have to ask if those people ever saw "Heathers" with Wynona Ryder and Christian Slater. That movie was the precursor to all the school violence. School Violence was a powder keg waiting to happen, and "Heathers" was the first movie to really touch on why. But I am getting WAY off the subject.  If you don't like violent movies...don't go see "Gangs" However if, like myself, you can remember it's all fake, I recommend seeing it. It was one of those movies that made me really think afterwards. It is the classic good vs. evil story but you begin to forget who is good and evil. You find loyalties getting confused, and while you think you know what's going to happen, it is not predictable.  As for "8 Mile" I saw that with my soul sista, MJ. Much to my surprise, she wanted to see it too. Every other word was F this and F that. But I expected that. If swearing is something you don't like, never see this movie or any black comedy for that matter unless it's rated PG-13 or something. I had heard that Eminem did a good job acting, but how could he not. He was basically playing himself. If it was autobiographical, now I know why he wrote the songs he did about his mom. Yikes! With a mom like that...well...it explains so much. Kim Bassinger did a great job playing his mom, in fact, I forgot it was her. Great job! I am not an advocate for the aforementioned rapper. I have heard some of his songs. I hate to say it, but he does have a point. He says the reason people don't like him and think he's so terrible is because he's white and we wouldn't give what he said the time of day if he were black. And everyone thought Elvis was terrible too. He did what Eminem is doing now. Taking black music, and giving it a white face and making it more popular with mainstream America. His music is raw and offensive but the rap scene has always had that quality about it. Like it or not, Eminem has hit a nerve, but he isn't really saying anything too different than what has been said before. He's just better known for saying it, unfortunately, because he's white. And, again, I am not a fan. I don't own any of his CDs. I just see his side. Especially after seeing the movie.   OK...don't hate me. Don't sign off my Blog yet. I have some more to say so hang tight.  I also saw "Undercover Brother". Now, I don't always find black comedy funny. But when I do, I think it's very funny. This was a very funny movie. While it was rated PG-13, there are some of you who may take offense to some of the language and material. But overall, I found this to be an entertaining video. It hit on a lot of black stereotypes and stereotypes in general. It was clever and outrageous.  Wow, exciting stuff. One thing I learned as the Opinion Editor of our college paper, the more angry letters you get, the more you know people other than yourself are reading what you write. Go ahead, let me have it!  In other news, I changed my nose ring to a nose screw. I am trying to be a little more conservative in my appearence. I have a job interview at MickyDs today at 4 pm EST. At this point, I just want to work. I don't care where. My tongue piercing shouldn't be an issue so long as I don't show it to the customers.  Let's see, movies, piercings, job search. I could go on, but I'll save some for later.  I leave you with a poem from my book, The Yosemite Diaries. Copies are still available. Contact me for more information. Thanks for reading.  The Yosemite Diaries Flesh and Spirit (Page 5) by Rachel Kochackis  Lord, You identity escapes me Like the passing colors of a sunset I can never hold such thoughts forever Divinity housed in humanity Teach me to live under such a revelation  You left it all behind Family, career, and comfort To grasp a glorious destiny That saved everyone But Yourself  I was wrong to believe You couldn't understand A world that calls us its own And clothes us in a nature That rebels against the Truth  Flesh and Spirt war The smoke of burning desire Stings the eyes fixed upon You While capable of full humanity Your divinity kept You pure  And now with cross in hand Through crowds that label me "fool" It is not my death which frightens me But can I die as obedient as You?

      Did I say the Bucs by 3? I meant 33! No seriously, I thought Rich Gannon should have got the Superbowl MVP. How many passes did he throw for interceptions that led to touchdowns, like 6? Good has triumphed over evil!  OK enough about Football.  I am sinking to an all time low. I am finally turning in my application to Starbucks. I am committing principle suicide, but hey, I'm desperate. I will do anything for a legal job, including work for Starbucks. The worse thing is they even make you kiss up to them on the application. I feel so dirty and cheap now.  The things we must do to survive.  Speaking of surviving, I got to share a bit of my story with a parent's support group in Louisville, KY. The same place where the seminar I will be sharing at will be. I am always more blessed than the parents, I think. There were a lot of people, all hurting, all feeling alone with their issue. I felt for every person there. It makes me pull myself up inspite of my current crippling depression, and move on. One more day. Because I know God has something awesome planned and I may actually get to be a part of it. No way am I missing out on that. The bad thing about being bi-polar is, even though I'm taking my medication, it doesn't always save me from the cycles of mania and depression. And I hate it. Mostly because I don't have control over it. It's not something tangible like a death in the family or something like that, that I can pin my feelings to. I am barely functional right now, and I feel so helpless. And I have to find a job on top of all this. I feel like I may as well have to save the world it seems so incredible. I share this, not because I want people to feel sorry for me. I share this because I can capture my faith best, like a photo of a sunset, on paper. Or in this case e-paper. I choose to believe this will pass. I choose to believe that God is good, all the time. And I know that some of my readership may be dealing with some of these same issues. To you I say, this shall pass. My phrase since Saturday night has been, "Let it go." And I will continue to walk in that. I have little control of the things that I am facing. And in the places I do have control, I will do what I can. Like give up my principles and apply at Starbucks for a job. I can't cash principles. And so long as it is not going against what God's will is, then it's a pretty silly principle to stand on when I have no job. Besides, they'll probably let me pierce and dye whatever I want. I guess that's one benefit.  I'm sorry that it took me so long to post to my blog. But with that virus that was going around, slowing all the major servers in the world, I thought it best to stay out of the virtual world. I mean, I couldn't even access my bank account to see just how overdrawn I am much less post something to my blog.  My lovely Jeep broke down...again. Jeeps, you love or hate them. And in my case, I love and hate mine. When it runs it can climb trees. But when it breaks down, I nearly run myself over rolling it out of my driveway and into the street. I have another car, but when there's, oh 1/2 an inch of snow, that Mazda Miata isn't going anywhere. It has no back window and the rear tail light section is smashed in from a wreck I had back in October.  I am reading over what I just wrote, and this is all very humorous! I am going to look back on these times and laugh. Not for awhile, but it will happen. Well, that's not entirely true, I'm laughing now.  I haven't been very successful at not playing with my tongue piercing. I can't help it. It's just fun. And you can't understand that unless you have had your tongue pierced. I never realized how much I would play around with it before I got it. But, I am more mindful.  Both my dogs, Mike and Vic, are lying on my bed looking at me and wondering why they can't sit on my lap while I type here at the computer. Then they snooze a bit and then they look at me again. No one believes me (who have met Mike and Vic) but they can be very mellow. I wish I took on life the way they do. They're biggest concern is how much Rachel time will they get and when do they get to eat again. But it certainly isn't a worry. It is an anticipation. I wish I looked at life as a series of anticipations instead of concerns or worries. Can I anticipate with great expectancy that my job will be calling soon? If I were Victoria I could. She expects everything with great excitement. (In fact, if I am away too long, she'll pee if I'm not careful in how I greet her) Now, I don't think I'll pee if I get a job, but I think I will experience her level of excitement for a change. Or how about healing? When I dig into that IAMS bag, Mike dances around with joy. Can I live in joy, waiting on a retroactive healing to occur? I wish I could be more like my dogs when it comes to life and my relationship with God. I'd be so much happier, less stressed, and more bold when it comes to seeking God.  Well, I'm off to strip myself of the little pride I had left and drop off my application at the Evil Empire...I mean Starbucks.  Thanks for reading.

      OK, I screwed up. There was only one entry for yesterday. I had to return a call to my family and now it is after midnight so I couldn’t get this on the Blog until now. So, I will give you chapters 3 and 4.  I hope you have enjoyed the manuscript so far.  A Working Manuscript by Rachel Kochackis Copyright pending 2003 No part of this manuscript may be reproduced in any form, without the express written consent of the author.  Chapter 3  Poet removed her Cloak of Many Names As Teacher cooked the rabbits Victory caught that night.  They found shelter Under an old weeping willow On a bluff over looking The next city from Worklyn.  Poet perched herself on a large rock As she solemnly played her guitar Feeling her intensity rise And spill through her fingertips.  The city waited below But she didn't know its name And now her heart spoke words Of question, sorrow and pain Poet felt very much alone.  Victory ran to Poet As he too sensed her sorrow In his own way He sought to comfort His new friend.  Teacher Witnessing it all Brought their dinner And his compassion To listen to his new pupil.  Victory lapped away her tears And finally brought a smile To the lonely Poet's face.  “Victory. How can I express my sorrow When you always bring me joy?” Poet exclaimed with gratitude As Victory curled up beside her.  Teacher  climbed  the rock To be with his two companions Victory had already begun working On Poet's troubled heart.  The three gave thanks and ate what God provided.  Teacher examined The Cloak of Many Names  “What will you wear tomorrow Prophet?”  Poet Looking up from her guitar Saw the cloak in Teacher's hands  “Today it was a Cloak of Solitude. I don't know what tomorrow will bring.”  “You are right Prophet Each new day Is like a lifetime With enough to deal with In its 24 hour life cycle.”  Poet continued to play her guitar. “I don't know that I will be comfortable With the name Prophet, Teacher.”  “God's work isn't always comfortable child. All God requires of you is a willing heart The rest is up to Him. Please, continue to sing what is on your heart.”  Poet strummed the guitar Closed her eyes And began to sing.         “A song is like a prayer         Pouring out of your soul             Through the strings of a guitar         As you beg to waste a lifetime             For the security of an eternity         While the ebb and flow of emotion             Steams down your face         Chilling and numbing you to the reality             That you have no control here         And as you watch it soar             Through the onyx sky         You know it's a futile attempt  at freedom             From the heart of the one                 Who captured your attention         You wonder if it can crack             Such infertile  ground         And as crescendo fades             To final strum         Your wary body shakes             Satisfied that God                 Finally  felt  your soul.”  Teacher warmly smiled and said, “A-w-w-w Prophet How can you be uncomfortable With your name?”  “Teacher. Poet quietly responded. “Those were merely words That express the present state of my heart How does that make me a Prophet? Truly some days I feel my intensity is a curse And my passions are my downfall Yet these are the very tools That help me create.”  “Child. Your expression of suffering Reaches out to the rest of humanity And the humanity within yourself Yet throughout it all You point to God Reminding yourself and others That perfection is not a pre-requisite For His love And if you were perfect What need would you have for a Savior? The issue you struggle with In essence, your humanity Is the thorn in your side That keeps you close to God. He paused. Solomon wrote:     ‘The man who fears God     Will avoid all extremes.’ What do you believe that to mean?”  Poet thought a moment. “Teacher. Solomon was one of the wisest men Who ever lived How can I even contemplate what he meant by that?”  Teacher  took Poet's hands.  “Look at your wrists child.”  Poet felt the bandages And looked up at Teacher  to continue  “All your life you have striven for an earthly perfection You could never attain And what did you accomplish?”  Poet's eyes questioned Teacher.  “Child. Look at your wrists again What was the result of your folly?”  “My Folly?! Poet immediately answered, As defensiveness filled her heart. “How can you call my service to God folly?!”  “I didn't call your service to God folly. I called your quest for earthly perfection folly. So what do you think Solomon meant?”  Poet thought again. “Perhaps to find balance Since I must avoid extremes. However, I'm not quite sure what that means.”  Teacher smiled, “You don't have to know everything at once Prophet That's one step to finding balance Does that make it a little more clear?”  “I think so Teacher. So am I ever going to find balance?”  “The fear of the Lord Is the beginning Of wisdom and knowledge. You definitely fear God. So long as you seek Him He gives these things freely. Add these things to your humility and faith And eventually you will find your answer.”  “We will continue your lesson tomorrow You've got enough to ponder today.”    Chapter 4  Teacher, Victory and Poet Arrived at the city gate at dawn. “Welcome to Futility.” The ornamental sign read.  Poet had heard of the city before Yet she had never realized How close it was to Worklyn  She had lost friends in Futility They died much too young In her heart she knew It could have just as easily been her.  The children of Futility Were spilling into the streets now All were anxious to play The Game  Teacher, Victory and Poet Stood just inside the gate As the children of Futility Lined themselves up Along the city wall  Poet watched in amazement As the children's excitement grew While they waited for the right moment to start The Game.  Suddenly a gust of wind Blew through the gate The children squealed with excitement As one of them reached into a leather gunny-sack The child threw a fine golden-metallic dust Into the wind Which was picked up and carried Into the innermost parts of the city.  Instantly the children shrieked with joy As they all began running from the city wall.  “CHASE THE WIND! CHASE THE WIND!” They all yelled out with glee.  Poet watched with amazement As the children chased the wind Reaching and grasping For the gold-dust In the breeze.  And when the winds died They all marched back To the city wall Empty-handed And waited for the next gust.   Poet questioned the child Who held the gunnysack.  “Little one What is the purpose of this game?”  The child looked up at Poet As if she had just spoke In a foreign language.  “I don't know.” The child responded. “It's just fun. Mommy says Futility is OK So long as you're enjoying yourself.”  And while those words Still lingered in the air Another gust of wind arrived The child with the gunny-sack Quickly fed the golden dust To the hungry air And again the children of Futility Chased the wind with joy And were finally consumed By the city streets.  Poet was speechless.  “Come with me Teacher Poet solemnly asked I need to see why I lost My friends here.”  And with that Poet, Victory and Teacher Set out to explore Futility.

      My mouth runnith over..  PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE TWO BLOG ENTRIES FOR TODAY! Not to worry, I should have Chapter 3 up soon!  OK, now there are those of you who have mentioned that you miss my “witty commentary” on life. As much as I am sure you all are enjoying my manuscript, I think there are those of you who want to see my jaded, oh I mean my slant on life.  A few weeks ago, I was having lunch with my friends, Holly, (who is from Bath, England), Joseph and Matt. I’ve talked about Joseph and Matt before. Same ones. :o)  I was telling them that at one time I had heard that there were labels on everyday products that denote them as kosher. I asked if any of them had heard of such a thing as I pointed to the Tabasco sauce and noted the K within a star on it. Other products, such as Pepsi, I have noted have just a blue K on it. They laughed at the idea, perhaps thinking it a bit conspiracy theory-ist. And it did sound pretty out there to me too. But I was merely asking if I was the only one who had heard of such a thing. Well, low and behold, as I was debunking yet another e-mail hoax at my favorite urbanlegends.com I happened across the following information. So, Holly, Joseph, Matt…you thought it was funny but, here you go! So don’t ever @#%$# laugh at me again. Ha ha. I just love symbol swearing. It’s just fun. It can say so much or so little depending on what you want to say. Don’t forget to look for Chapter 3!  “In fact, General Mills does provide at least one religion-based service for customers. The company regularly pays Jewish groups for the right to label its food products “kosher,” since many Jews look for that seal to determine if food conforms to their requirements. www.urbanlegends.com (see Dr. Pepper removes God from patriotic cans…story from Agape Press.com)”  “The system of labeling products Kosher goes back at least 100 years in America. Jews who are strict about maintaining Jewish dietary laws need to know which products, both meat and non-meat, are fit for consumption. Kosher labeling is one major way to determine this. There are about 300 Kosher certification agencies in the U.S. There are also a number of different Kosher labels.  Sound Vision spoke to Rabbi Moshe Elefant, executive rabbinical coordinator of the Orthodox Union (OU) based in Manhattan, New York to explain his organization's Kosher labeling system.  Rabbi Elefant administers the OU's worldwide Kosher programs. The OU maintains one of the strictest standards of Kosher as an Orthodox Jewish Organization, although they also serve non-Orthodox Jewish communities.  "We certify 4500 facilities in 68 countries around the world and every one of the 50 states in the United States," he noted in a telephone interview with Sound Vision.  The OU has been doing Kosher labeling for the past 100 years in the US Their first client, Heinz ketchup, is still labeled by them.  The different Kosher labels The OU's Kosher label is indicated by their initials, but there are other Kosher agencies with different labels as well. Some of these are: MK, OK (Organized Kashruth) and a star with the letter "K" in it.  The difference in Kosher labeling companies is explained by the fact that "a lot of local Jewish communities have their own rabbinical board," says rabbi Elefant, which determine Kosher standards and have their own symbols. These labels go not just on meat, but also on everyday items like cereal, for instance. For a product to gain the OU's approval and label, not only does the product itself have to be Kosher, but all ingredients added to it, including flavors must pass the test of Kosher approval. (http://www.soundvision.com/Info/halalhealthy/kosherlabeling.asp)”  So there it is. Everyday foods, are labeled as kosher for consumption by people of the Jewish faith I was not imagining it. I hope you find my blog now, not only entertaining, but educational. Say, did you hear the one about the Rabbi, the Priest and the Blonde that walk into a bar. Well…shame on you! :o)  Have a great day! And thanks for reading.

      Greetings.  I hope you all have been anxiously waiting Chapter 2.  Tonight I experienced a deep level of healing. Although, I can’t tell you what or how it happened. Those of you who have experienced this, you know what I mean. Basically, I was able to have release of some deep deep hurts that have been underwraps for sometime. I am thankful, although I have no idea what has been touched.  But enough of that. On to Chapter 2!  A Working Manuscript by Rachel Kochackis Copyright Pending 2003 No part of this manuscript may be reproduced in any form, without the express written consent of the author.   Chapter 2  Poet left Worklyn Early the next morning She had packed Her poems, guitar, food, water And her Cloak of Many Names  “Today it is a Cloak of Solitude.” She said as she left the city boundaries.  Shouts of "Heretic" and "Backslider" Could be heard from many windows Bad news travels fast in Worklyn.  Poet thought long and hard About Friend's reaction Worklyn is all she's ever known But Poet knew The Wall was man made There must be a way around it.  Poet traveled west Her homelands and Worklyn Would soon be far behind her And off in the horizon The mountains rose to heaven There must be a breach in the Wall there.  Poet's heart cried out in fear What if the Wall is made by God? Will He strike me down For going my own way?  “Child. Did you ask Jesus into your heart?” A voice from nowhere asked.  Poet turned with a start An old man was approaching Behind her on the path.  “Yes. When I was younger I did.”  The old man smiled, “Then why do you fear God's judgment?”  Poet thought a moment, “The people of Worklyn Call me "Heretic" What if they are right?”  “What if they are wrong?” The old man quickly answered.  Poet's heart turned cynical “Sir. Surely you must be a heretic as well.”  The old man laughed gleefully and answered “Oh, I've been called many things But you may call me Teacher.”  Poet responded, “Truly, I shall not call you Teacher Merely because you say so.”  The old man's smile grew larger. “Very good Prophet Your time in Worklyn was well spent Jesus said many would come in His name You are right not to trust me Just on my word.”  Poet was stunned To hear him call her Prophet.  “Sir. Do you know me? If so, you must know I am unworthy of the name Prophet. And how did you know...”  “The questions only spoke by your heart? Many people on this road Harbor the same questions. But discernment Is a gift of the Spirit. And worthiness Has nothing to do with one's calling.  “Your humility and faith Are all you need right now.”  Poet was not convinced. “Sir. With all due respect I am only a poet Although there were times People called me Prophet I do not believe prophecy Is my gift.”  The old man reached out to Poet's hand. He touched the bandages and said, “You have suffered many things You can not understand And you still suffer Yet you still seek God Your intensity of emotion Is a release for the human condition Those who have ears to hear Will hear And when God is your muse You are His Prophet. Do you understand?”  “Yes Teacher. Poet responded. ìI think I do.”  “That's a good start Prophet May I join you on your journey?"  "I would be most grateful You are very welcome to come along.”  Teacher clapped his hands together, “Splendid! However, I'm not alone Can we bring another with us?”  “Who?”  Teacher whistled, “Victory! Victory!”  Out of a distant shrub A large furry gray dog Came trotting up along side Teacher.  “I call him Victory His acute sense of smell Helps him find The smallest morsels of food At times of great hunger.”  “Hi Victory!” Poet greeted him And they were instantly friends.  “Very well. Teacher continued, “Prophet, Victory Let us make the next city by nightfall.”

      Greetings to all of you in Blogland.  I am watching Law & Order and there is a priest on trial for following his faith that God told him to kill a drug dealer who killed a boy.  He earnestly believed that he was guilty of man’s law, but not God’s. That it is ok to kill someone who kills. Interesting. The state kills murders. Just makes me go hummm.  As I mentioned yesterday, I thought I may start putting my manuscript up for all of you to read. Maybe you all can give me feedback, tell me if it makes sense or not.  A Working Manuscript by Rachel Kochackis Copyright pending 2003 No part of this manuscript may be reproduced without the express written consent of the author.  Chapter 1  The young Poet awoke one morning Just like every other morning Angry that God chose to spare her life today Joy was surely a stranger.  Some called her Prophet For truly she suffered like one Growing up wild During the wars in her homelands.  Her emotions were fragmented Yet she sought refuge in God In spite of the Wall Built by other believers.  The Wall was immeasurable Stretching as far as the eye can see With one gate guarded By the Moral Majority.  Your character had to be impeccable They had spies everywhere And you could never leave Worklyn Without much criticism.  Worklyn. Odd name for a town A city really But appropriate Once you live there.  The Majority would take to the streets:  “Here's another opportunity to serve God Don't forget to tithe And never waste a conversation It could be their last you know.”  They were always collecting souls More importantly new citizens to Worklyn And Poet very much wanted to do God's work To please everyone and God Then perhaps she'd please herself.  Poet knew she belonged to God That was never in question But the nature she had been born with Would not always conform Therefore when she was "Out of fellowship with God" She could not enter the gate.   She was lost for many years In the fluffy Christian-made world Of music, books, and fellowship Horrified to ever pen The true nature of her heart.  “Oh God.” She tearfully prayed “Why did you allow my birth? I hate myself and I want to die And strife is all my life has seen.  “The Majority says if I really belong to You I'd love You And if I love You I'd be obedient Now since I can't stay obedient I must not love You Therefore You can not love me Because we are not in fellowship.  “You will not change my nature And I shall surely never succeed Therefore I will take my life So I will not sin against You in this matter.”  With a candle lit Tears, blood, and wax Dripped to the floor Physical pain is a small price for peace.  When Poet awoke for the second time today Her wrists were bandaged And questions of why Were hurled from all directions.  Poet got up on one elbow And began to speak:  “I sought God to save my soul My obedience stemmed from fear, not love And while I lived with Death I found comfort in the Promise of Paradise For as a child I was left With nothing else to grasp for My search for God Was for the most selfish of motives I feared Hell I tried to use God It didn't work And I don't think He wants me anymore.”  A leader from the Majority was there He asked the question All wanted to know,  “Why Poet? How can you say these things about God?”  “Because I was born With an unorthodox nature That I can neither understand nor control I will never fit in here in Worklyn And God never sought to change me.”  The leader spoke from his position of authority,  “Perhaps if you change your hair style It's quite too short in some places.”  Poet responded in disbelief, “I bare my pain to you And you critique The length of my hair? What does that have to do With the status of my soul?  “If God will truly not accept me Then I shall leave Worklyn.  “Am I so evil To love whom I choose? I don't know Perhaps I'll find out.  “You can pray for my soul But it's not mine anymore I gave it to God And there are no refunds.  “I am not perfect I must be true to my God and myself Would I be more acceptable as a hypocrite?  “I can not change the world Save it yourself I can not change anyone's destiny.  “Perhaps a whale seeks me And I often speak with jack-asses But for all the tears I've spent on humanity I have never purchased a soul That's God's job How can I be asked to undertake Such a super-natural task?  “Arrogant? Perhaps. But it's not what I intended.  “I merely wish to do my time With the one I love Just like anyone else.  “My blinding obedience Nearly sent me to my grave For only death could assure My complete compliance to God.  “Yet I still live.  “So I choose existence on this plane If that makes me selfish I can live with that.”  Many began to leave the room And the one who called herself Friend Came to Poet's side.  “Poet. I do not understand Where are you going?”  “I don't know Friend Their are many cities along the Wall Perhaps I'll find my answer.”  “But Poet If you go against God He will not hear you.”  “Friend. I am merely accepting What I can not change I don't see how that Can dishonor or anger God.”  “What if you meet another Like yourself Will you sin?”  “More than likely It is my nature But do I deliberately seek to do so No. I am merely questioning.”  “Poet you are a stranger now I do not know you any more.”  “Friend I am still the same person My perspective is merely different from yours.”  “If I send word on my travels Will you respond?”  “I don't think so Poet Good-bye.”  And then she was alone at last.

      Hello and thank you for returning to my Blog. Absence makes the heart grow fonder and this Blog is like a puppy dog. You have to keep feeding in or your readership will wonder what’s wrong.  I know my last entry mentioned my crippling depression, but it has passed. I am alive and well. My Jeep is running again. The Distributor went out. I think that completes everything. I think every thing in that Jeep has been replaced. So if anything else goes wrong, it's probably wiring or I wrecked it...God forbid. Jeeps are notorious for funky electrical wiring. So, I love my Jeep again!  The Seminar went well. Thank you to all who prayed. The Lexington Herald-Leader did a less than flattering article about the ministry. It was to be expected. As always, it was more of a blessing to me than to those who attended. We had close to 100 people show. I thought that was cool.  We got to have a get together at one of the parents from the support groups home. Their house was fabulous, right out of Martha Stewart!  Their finished basement was bigger than my house, with a living room with surround sound, a game room with a pool table and a Seeburg jukebox. I didn’t want to leave. I never got to see the up stairs.  Yesterday I got a major answer to prayer. I haven’t got a job, but I have been asking God to help me live out my passion. I want to make videos/films. I want to be a film maker. Well, I went to meet with my pastor and he gave me the keys to the office. See, it seems they have editing capability with a computer with the complete Adobe suite. Illustrator, Photoshop, but more importantly Premiere and After Affects. No one knows how to use any of it and he said he would do anything to help me learn. I almost cried. I asked him if I could do documentaries on the ministry, because that was going to be my first video project and he told me I could do what ever I want as long as it’s legal. YEAH GOD!! Anyone know where I can get a crash course in Premiere and After Affects?  Tomorrow, I go back to my former place of employment to a luncheon of local Christian businesses to give my testimony with CrossOver. Maybe I can find a job their? :o) Maybe some millionaire will take pity on me and want to be my foster parent because I am undergoing such a difficult journey. Maybe this millionaire will send me to school to be a video/film maker. Hey...it could happen.  Thank you to all who are loyal readers and who keep asking where my new entries are. That way it keeps me accountable to keep this thing going. Frankly, somedays, there just isn’t anything to say. Maybe I can start posting chapters from my manuscript, and you all can give me feedback and tell me what you think. And those of you with the connections, can point your publisher friends this way for a contract. OK, so maybe I a little too blunt.  My love to all.  Until next time.

       Hello all. And Happy Hallmark Holiday to you. Oh, I mean, Happy Valentines Day. Did you know a massacre happened on this date in history? I think that's cool!  Here's a little song, I'd like to dedicate to all the single unattached people out there. This one's for you my brothas and sistas! Peace.   "You love her But she loves him And he loves somebody else You know you just can't win And so it goes 'Til the day you DIE! This thing they call love Is gonna make you cry I Got the Blues, the Reds and the Pinks...all I can say is...LOVE STINKS   (chorus) LOVE STINKS Yeah, yeah LOVE STINKS (Come on you know the words, sing along!) LOVE STINKS Yeah yeah LOVE STINKS"    --Love Stinks, The J. Giles Band (No not by Adam Sandler in the "Wedding Singer!")    I am IMing with my friend Angel aka Stacy, but she doesn't like to tell people that...Ooops sorry about that Angel. :oP   We have talked about Whales, Jack-Asses...see we were talking about the Bible and literal meanings of scripture, AOL and LOLs and the wonders of AOL 8.0. And...I told her I was going to tell everyone to pray for her. There, I said it. Nothing you can do about it now. It's set in webstone. Hey...is that a word? Well...it is now! This is my world and I can do what I want. Ok...getting carried away.   Angel is one of my dear friends who lives in Cali. She is not a native. But she's still cool. She's the only certified Harley mechanic I know, and if I ever get a motorcycle, I'm going to make her help me pick it out. Deep down though, I want a Westcoast Chopper! A custom built bike by Jesse James. With the handshifter and the neon lights...Mmm motorcycles...Aurrgh (drool drool). Did you know that Homer Simpson is the voice of my flesh? We all have inner voices that speak to us, and he is one of mine.   Seriously though, I value Angel's friendship because we can have deep, frank conversations about the world we live in, and life in general. And still be friends afterwards! :o) Thanks Angel...and thanks for being a regular subscriber to My Not So Secret Life!   And you too can be featured in My Not So Secret Life. Just write me and tell me what you like about my Blog and you'll receive a free t-shirt. Well...you won't get a t-shirt...but I will feature you on my Blog for all the world to see!   I got a special award this evening. And here is the e-mail announcement:   "Yo Yo Yo RK!!! In recognition of your great ebonical writings, we at  the VANILLA ICE FOUNDATION would like to congratulate you as we have  chosen you as the recipient of the EMINEM SPEAK YOUR MIND AWARD!  Congratulations!!!!   In honor of your achievement in the ebonical studies, we put together  this little rap for you...sorry no tunes, you'll have to hook up with  Dr. Dre and put a track together (really Bill should have had this read "lay a track down") on your own......so for now just the  words:   KICK IT!!!! (Billy Barfer whiteboy version)   Nooooooowwwwwwww, I got a good friend she lives in Kentucky hangin' down low with all the otha Chuckies   They know she's not a local but no one really minds Cuz, they love her trash talkin' that she posts online!!!   Rich, poor or homeless, it really doesn't matta, she'll jam your flat glass with a sickle and a hamma!!!   So, keep it on the real and she might let you be But start your trashing talkin' and she'll come her G's   She'll rip you up bad but she'll never get caught, then she'll hang you out to dry on her site at Blogspot!!!   Word!"   I, I don't know what to say. Really. I am quite touched (sniffle, sniffle). It's Black History Month...and this has got to be one of the greatest things that ever happened to a ghetto girl like me. Thanks man.   It has been brought to my attention that I forgot 3 of the all time greatest movies from my poll. One of which, hasn't been released yet. Yes. You guessed it. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy! I am so sorry I missed that! So, I had to make sure I made a special acknowledgement in light of my glarring oversite. I hope you all can forgive me. I have just been so preoccupied with MY PRECIOUS.   Yikes...there's a scarey thought. But, I am no better than Gollum. In fact, I relate to him right now. Having an unnaturally prolonged exisitence because of my obsession with THE PRECIOUS. Oh...so many of them. Completely oblivious to the fact that MY PRECIOUS sucks the life out of me. But so long as I keeps THE PRECIOUS then I am ok. How easily we can chastise Gollum, when we all are blinded by our PRECIOUS.   What's your PRECIOUS? What is binding you to the Dark Lord? Are you feeling like butter spread too thin over a slice of bread? Then don't you think it's best to return THE PRECIOUS to the fiery mountain of Mordor and destroy it? Yes, the quest is life-threatening. But we must die to ourselves anyway. What do we have to lose, but our enslavement to THE PRECIOUS.   Well...since no one said anything about missing the manuscript, maybe I'll wait until someone misses it. I don't feel like posting the next chapter tonight.  Before I go, I want to share a few links with you so you can check out some of the better sites on the web.

      Hello Hello Hello!  So how do you like my Blog now, huh? I have a weekly poll, a web counter, and a guestbook now! Make sure you all check out these great new features!  You know, I am really starting to like HTML, you can steal a lot of things from other sites that way!  I wanted give props out to my peeps...  To all those in Southern Cali, in the Chavez Barrio (Bill, Ang, and Iz...aka Isaac), the South Bay and Chulajuana...Word! To my peeps sufferin in the harsh extremes of MI, OH, KY, IN, PA, MO, AR, XYZ and everywhere else but here, Peace.  I just want to know one thing. Are any of you readin' this? No one ever hits the contact and writes whut up. Is anyone reading my manuscript? It would be cool to know what ya'll think dog.  OK, enough practicing the Ebonics.  I have spent the last few hours improving my Blog for your entertainment pleasure, I am scraping my brain for something fresh to say. After all, you took the time to visit.  Let's see.  Oh, I visited The Stadium, and for those of you who don't know, it is an overgrown arcade with Rockclimbing, Bowling, Simulated Golf (Coming Soon), Laser Tag, an indoor Soccer field and I think that's it. It's one of the places I was trying to get a job at. Anyway, I went there with my friend Stuart from church after our Bible study tonight. He was showing me his favorite game. It's a dance game. Yes, you read that correctly, a dance game. It kicked my #@$ I mean butt. Man, I am really old and out of shape! 4 or 5 years ago, I would have done some damage, but man what a workout!! It's fun though. I wish I would have had that game around when I first got here and wanted to go clubbing all the time! The there was the Air Hockey. (Remember our brutal grudge matches Bill?) This is one of the fastest air hockey games I have ever seen and the puck is about half the usual size and goes twice as fast. It is almost impossible to keep that puck from going airborne! Definately not for the faint-hearted. By the way, I won both games.  I bet you all are wondering what I decided job wise. Well, I thought it best not to take the McDonalds position for reasons I won't go into here. I am pursuing a career as a Pharmacy Tech and I am going to enroll in online courses to obtain certification. So that's the latest on my job search.  I went and saw the movie "Chicago." Yes, I know, some of you are thinking, "But it's a musical!" Yes Virginia, it is a musical and to my surprise, I liked it. And I guess I'm not alone since it is up for 13 Oscar nominations, not that that really means anything. Keep in mind, I was the person who refused to see "The Sound of Music" until about 2 or 3 years ago when I found out there were Nazis and other cool stuff in it. Wait, I don't think Nazis are cool anymore than I would like the musical "Springtime for Hitler" but like "Chicago" "The Sound of Music" had an exciting plot besides all the singing and dancing. By the way, if you want to know more about "Springtime for Hitler," watch the movie, "The Producers." Very funny. I thought that Rene Zel...something something...I can barely pronounce her name correctly much less spell it. She was in "Bridget Jones's Diary" and I think that Tom Cruise movie...you know..."Show me the money." I didn't see it, but that's the famous catch phrase from it. The one about the sports agent guy. Anyway, let's just call her, Rene did a great job. She was very funny! And Cathrine Zeta-Jones...just one word. Excellent. Richard Gere, well, he was ok. It was weird seeing him sing and dance. So, yes, I liked two musicals now. Ok are you happy? I admitted it. Whew. It feels so good to just come out with that. It's so freeing. I feel much better now.  So let me see, dance game, job, "Chicago" -- I think that was everything I was planning to share. As for the manuscript, I am holding it hostage today for lack of feedback. I am feeling rather silly posting it, but I am sure I'll get over it. :o)  Hope you all had an eye-full. Thanks for stopping by today!  Ciao

      DUDE, YOU'RE GETTING A BUZZ!  That’s right, the Dell Dude got busted for Pot. I guess he really is as much of a stoner as he looks! The drug bust information comes from Fox News. Check out the story below or at their site: http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,78110,00.html  NEW YORK — Benjamin Curtis, better known as "Steven," the Dell Computer pitchman, was arrested Sunday night for buying a small bag of marijuana, police said. Curtis, a 22-year-old actor and New York University drama student famous for the phrase, "Dude, you're getting a Dell," was arraigned Monday on a misdemeanor drug possession charge. The charge assumes a suspect is not carrying more than a "use amount" -- enough to roll several marijuana cigarettes.  Police said he was arrested on New York City's Lower East Side after officers on a drug detail spotted him buying a small bag of marijuana from Omar Mendez, 19. Mendez faces drug sale and possession charges. At the arraignment, Criminal Court Judge Ellen Coin advised Curtis that his case will be dismissed, and his record expunged, if he avoids arrest during the next year. Asked if he understood, the Dell Dude said, "Yes, ma'am." Outside court, Curtis' lawyer, James Moschella, said: "We are confident that at the appropriate time, the charges will be dismissed." Curtis' portrayal of Steven drove up computer sales and spawned T-shirts, caps, and backpacks, along with Web sites and online fan clubs. A spokesman for Texas-based Dell said no decision has been made on Curtis' future promoting the company. "We are following the situation and really trying to understand what happened here," Venancio Figueroa said.”  Time to get on the quick-buck band-wagon and make up shirts that mock the Dell Dude. Some slogans I am thinking of are: Dude…you’re getting probation! Dude…you’re getting a bong. Dude…you’re hitting a bong. Dude… (that’s it just…Dude…It goes with the stoner image) Easy to Use, Easy to Buy, Easy as Pot. (That is a play off the Dell slogan, Easy to Use, Easy to Buy, Easy as Dell) Easy to Use, Easy to Buy, but can he roll his own? And maybe a Dell Marijuana leaf with the Intell Inside logo or the Pentium logo. It’s not legal, but neither is pot.  And secretly, I think Dell Computer Corporation is happy about this because how they deal with the Dell Dude will determine their future with the under 30 crowd who I am sure for the most part doesn’t think this is a big deal. Sad but true.  America, wake up and smell your schizophrenic philosophy on drugs, not to mention your neighbors pot smoke. (Canada has legalized it and in Mexico, well anything goes there.) Alcohol is the only legal recreational use drug we recognize. Drugs aren’t the answer, but I have to stay on my “legal” drugs to be mentally functional. And I know I’m not the only one getting that mixed-message. And we wonder why we are losing the war on drugs. I don’t know if it would be better to legalize any of the illegal drugs, but we opened the barn door with the end to prohibition. Either we are against all recreational use drugs and make a stand, or forget it. With one gray area, it leaves many in the public conscience. The only way to stop the supply is to kill the demand. And with as messed up as everyone has become, the families we come from, and the spiritual bankruptcy of this nation, I don't see that happening anytime soon. But enough about my feelings on the American drug policy, which, if you haven’t seen the movie "Traffic," you won’t understand my feelings.  You know, if the Dell Dude lived in Cali, he would have only got a ticket and the pot would have been confiscated. Less than an Ounce is for personal use! And, if I am not mistaken, that amount has recently been raised in some cities because of the growing number of grass-roots (ha ha…that’s funny…no pun intended!) Medical Marijuana groups springing up and having grower co-ops. Oh to be in California, now that the end to pot prohibition is near. Ha ha.  More bad news. In my quest for a job, I had to remove my nose piercing. I am sorry to say that in as little as 6 hours time, the hole in my nose closed up. When I went to put my jewelry back in, I ended up re-piercing myself. That didn’t feel too good. This is what I am going to have to go through everyday as I seek a job in conservative America. I think I will have to keep my jewelry with me and keep my piercing fresh by excusing myself momentarily and putting it back in.  I have my choice between a sure job at McDonalds and maybe a better job through Kelly Services. I have many reasons to not take the McDonalds job, but I am also hungry to work. I also have a prospect with Samaritan Hospital and want to apply for their Pharmacy Tech position. I am one minute wanting to take the McDonalds job and the next not. I have until tomorrow to give them my decision.  Well, that’s the latest. On to the next installment in my manuscript.   A Working Manuscript by Rachel Kochackis Copyright pending 2003 No part of this manuscript may be reproduced in any form, without the express written consent of the author.  Chapter 7  The sun was starting to set Poet watched with great anticipation As the mountains were now A silhouette against her mind's eye  Hope sensed her anxiousness As she added wood To the fire Teacher tended Victory was chasing Another rabbit into the surrounding brush.  Poet held the Cloak of Many Names Pressing it against her heart As if she could squeeze answers Out of inanimate fabric She sighed Futility has influenced me at last And upon accepting That no new answer Would come tonight She picked up her guitar And sought solitude again  Hope followed her To the tree where she sought refuge After some silence A melancholy tune Filled the air But Poet hadn't The heart to sing tonight Yet there was no need Hope could hear the sadness With each note And upon feeling Prophet's sorrow Released the tears Her heart held captive It was as though It were her sorrow as well  The music stopped.  Hope? Is that you?  Yes Prophet I'm sorry I disturbed you I'll go back to the camp.  No. It's OK Hope. You may stay But why do you call me Prophet, as well? I told you I'm just Poet  Teacher calls me Hope And you he calls Prophet I will do the same For my name Is far removed From my character as well. Tell me Prophet What sorrows have conceived The tearful notes you play?  Poet smiled My dear Hope You have much To contend with yourself. You needn't concern yourself With the reasons for my woe.  Prophet Don't be deceived by my youth I have known much pain as well Do you know what it is like To discover that all you have been taught is a lie? I played Chase the Wind for many years Before I realized It was the very definition of Futility Empty Striving after nothing...  Vanity? Poet asked.  Exactly. And while I may not understand The depth of life's purpose At least I finally have one Thanks to you.  I gave you no purpose Merely a choice.  But you brought Teacher Into my life And I am ever so grateful Hope smiled You saved me. God saved you I just happened to be The instrument He chose to use That's all.  All the same... Thank you. She waited for a reply.  Reluctantly Poet looked up and smiled You're welcome.  Is this a private party Or is any one invited?  The voice was strange And startled Poet and Hope A beautiful young man Stepped out from the darkness Poet stood immediately To confront him.  What do you want? Poet demanded.  The young man smiled Do you not seek a breach in the Wall Poet? The man tried to approach Hope With the same question But Poet stood between them Speak from there stranger.  Do you always meet good news With such hostility Poet?  Poet was unmoved.  The man continued Many people seek my service Yet are unaware You may call me Philosopher.  I asked for no introduction Poet snapped Unsure as to where This anger was coming from.  Don't you want me to help you Poet?  What need have I for a Philosopher When I have a Teacher?  The young man laughed Don't tell me You've met that foolish old man Who answers questions With more questions I thought you sought truth Poet.  I do. And I don't remember telling you my name.  There is no need I know your heart And your love for words I love words as well Remember this? "Hear me my love Reach into my solitude And restore this human being. Embrace me with the knowledge That the only gifts I bare Are imperfect love, trust and devotion. Let our love burn so intensely As to sear an indelible mark Upon the universe. Guiding the path for others In search of what we have."  Poet was stunned That's one of my poems.  That's right Philosopher smiled And who do you think your muse was?  I never considered The muse of that poem.  Pleased to meet you, Poet No need to guess my name.  Hope was still uneasy With Philosopher's presence Undetected She ran back to camp.

      Hello and welcome, again to my Blog.  Yesterday was an interesting day. I started having chest pain, my left arm went numb, and had pain traveling into my jaw. Except for not having shortness of breath, or SOB as the abbreviation goes, I was almost convinced that I was having heart trouble.  God, in His kindness brought a Cardiologist to me at Church. Unfortunately, the pain never went away and I ended up in the ER just to find out what I suspected all along, it was not my heart. They gave me a percocete and sent me home after like 5 hours. Now, not having family in town really sucks when you are trying to find a ride home from the ER. But, God provided, my friend Jennifer was able to come and get me. But this was after one maybe and several no answers on the phone.  Today, I was going to make 50 bucks doing a UK Psych study. Unfortunately, after my drug screen, I tested positive for morphine...aww Percocete! There went my 50 bucks! Yesterday costed me more money than I realized! But I did get a perscription filled for Oxycodone. I suppose I could sell that for 50 bucks...Ha Ha. I wouldn’t do that, or at least I wouldn’t incriminate myself by admitting it on here for the world to see. But, enough about all that.  Now, I have gone from no job prospects to 3 different appointments for job opportunities just for tomorrow! I have no idea which job to take. None of them are a sure thing, but I don’t want to burn bridges either. McDonald’s called, The Stadium (which would be a cool place to work) and I have my appointment at Kelly Services for Temp jobs. I have no idea what to do.  When it rains, it pours...they say about Morton Salt and I guess life.  That’s the latest from my world, on to the world of Poet, Teacher, Victory and the mystery girl... find out more about her in today’s Blog!  Take care, and thanks for reading.  A Working Manuscript by Rachel Kochackis Copyright pending 2003 No part of this manuscript may be reproduced in any form, without the express written consent of the author.  Chapter 6  A half an hour passed Before the youth sobered And contained her crying spell Victory patiently waited As she finally Released him from her grip  Teacher knelt beside her and smiled warmly  Poet seized the moment And quickly asked Please tell us What is your name?  The girl smiled All the while the tears Softly continued Hope She sobbed And upon realizing the irony Released a huge grin I guess I sure don't Live up to my name though  Poet interjected That's OK And pointing to Teacher Continued He calls me Prophet And I don't live up To my name either  Teacher stood And helped Hope to her feet Brushing the hair Away from her eyes He finally spoke As I told Prophet So I shall also say to you Worthiness has nothing to do With one's calling, my child And you may also call me Teacher  Bark!!  Teacher laughed I was just getting to your name This is Victory  Victory stood On his hind legs And drank from Hope's tears As a beaming smile Overtook her sorrow Finally Hope spoke again What brings you to Futility?  Poet's heart Was again darkened By the memory Of all she had witnessed Many things have brought me here But now I seek to find out Why my friends died here And finally revealed The true intention of her journey The nature of her heart And her search for a breach in the Wall I never spoke of these things To you Teacher Poet finally realized Why did you not ask?  Teacher smiled I know your heart Prophet Why do you think I asked to come with you?  Poet was perplexed Yet sought To now focus on Hope Tell me of your life in Futility  Hope was uneasy With the request Teacher took her hand Share what is on your heart child  Hope looked at Poet's hand I'm sorry about the pain I caused  Poet smiled Pain is not a stranger to me I will live Can we say the same of you?  Hope smiled But uncertainty Filled her heart Can I join you On your journey As well Prophet?  Poet's expression Broke out into An uneasy grin Et Tu Brute?  What? Hope asked  Nevermind. I don't know Where I'm going How long it will take Or if I'll know My destination When I find it. But all are welcome To seek God What say you Teacher?  Teacher nodded My question is this Hope. Do you wish me to join this journey?  Oh please Teacher Do not stop on my account If you wish me to stay...  No. Teacher stopped her Do you wish me to stay?  Hope smiled Please come with us I want to learn too How to live And understand my name.  Very well Teacher finished Let us make camp At the edge of Futility.

      Greetings to all of you in Blogland.  Tonight, I began my return trip. I took my 2nd step on my journey of another 1000 miles. Regardless of the fact that my treadmill has a max weight that I am rapidly closing on, I yanked that sucker out of my bedroom so I can use it again. Either I’ll quit or that treadmill will. I finally decided it was ridiculous to keep a treadmill safe while my health stays in jeopardy. It is now in my livingroom and I have vowed to attempt 5 minutes of max enduance a day to start. It’s the only way to keep from stressing my treadmill. I plan to do this often and increase my time gradually while I continue my resistance training.  So I tell you all this as a form of accountability. I just completed my first round. I hope to do this often throughout the day, for sure once a day. To anyone on the same journey, I say keep going, it’s worth it. To those who are not there, I say, come join me. Do something everyday for your health. Take it from me, I miss the level of fitness I once had, I hope to get it back again. I may not be a Personal Trainer anymore, but that's no reason to let my health go to hell.  Now, on to Chapter 5.  A Working Manuscript by Rachel Kochackis Copyright pending 2003 No part of this manuscript may be reproduced in any form, without the express written consent of the author.  Chapter 5  Poet, Victory and Teacher Walked through the streets of Futility Teacher continually gave Victory Verbal commands As they reached The center of population  At every cross road Teacher would ask Victory To sit and wait While he checked to see If all was clear  Victory would not Enter the busy streets Without Teacher's permission  And while many were amazed At Victory's obedience Including Poet Some were angry That this dog Was not restrained  A woman spoke to Teacher  “How can you let him Run loose in Futility? If you loved and cared for him You would keep him restrained”  “Woman. Your short sightedness Betrays you.” Teacher responded “Victory knows my voice And he follows. He also knows My commands Are for his own protection.”  Well. The woman continued As she tried To out smart Teacher. What if he disobeys Just once And is killed? What say you then Of your love for him And his obedience to you?  Narrow-minded woman! This “dumb” animal Understands a concept Few humans ever will. True love requires freewill And while Victory Is far from perfect He knows There are consequences To every action Good or bad.  If Victory will not follow And obey me freely How can I say He loves me? And if I make him Follow with restraints How then can I say I love him? And if he dies As a result Of his disobedience I will be saddened But I will not love him any less.  That's ridiculous! The woman answered. He's just a dog.  And you're just a sinner. Teacher responded. Does God love you any less?  And with that The woman Walked away Indignant  Poet looked at Teacher As if to speak  What say you About freedom and obedience? Teacher quickly asked.  Poet smiled Truly Victory understands The concept Much better than I do Teacher.  Teacher laughed Just remember Prophet What Paul wrote “All things are lawful for me     But not all things are profitable.”  Tell me Prophet, Teacher continued, What do you wear today?  Poet slipped into Her Cloak of Many Names, I asked myself That very question this morning.  And your conclusion?  Today It is a Cloak of Uncertainty. For I do not know What my travels Will yield today.  Your honesty serves you well Prophet.  And as the three companions Continued their trek They came across A troubled youth Sitting weeping On a corner  She held a sign before her And a revolver in her hand In her drunkenness she screamed That she was sickened by Futility  Poet's heart when out to her She sought to see the sign "Will Live for Purpose" Was all it simply read.  Poet approached the youth, How old are you My young friend?  Eighteen. What's it to you?  Eighteen is far too young To be so bitter There is so much more In life to come To really anger you. Poet smiled.  The girl was not amused But she did notice Poet's bandaged wrists. What happened to you?  I tried to meet with death Before my appointed time. Poet confessed.  The girl smirked. Next time try a gun It's much more reliable.  Is that your intention? Poet asked.  Yeah. The girl answered And pointed the revolver To her temple. Just as she pulled the trigger Poet put the palm of her hand Between the hammer And the barrel. She screamed out an obscenity As she wrench the pistol away With her other hand.  Are you crazy! Poet screamed As she gingerly removed Her now bloody hand From the revolver's grip.  The young girl Looked up at Poet, Do you call me crazy For my attempt Or for being more determined Than you were?  Look. Poet replied As anger filled her heart If you want to kill yourself That's one thing. But I won't let you do it In front of me. Besides, You're the one With a sign that says “Will Live for Purpose.” Obviously You don't really Want to die.  Teacher took Poet's hand, I guess another bandage Isn't going to bother you Prophet. After accessing the damage Teacher wrapped Poet's hand To stop the bleeding  Meanwhile Victory comforted The troubled young girl Who wrapped Her arms around him And wept uncontrollably.

      So...It has come to my attention (A-choo-Patty...cough cough) that some of you are regular subscribers to My Not So Secret Life and not once have you signed my guestbook or made a comment (Patty)...but I'm not going to name names or anything. But, apparently, some of you (Patty) have been mouthing of about My Not So Secret Life to my sister and she knows everything I say on here (Patty) from someone who I won't embarrass by naming for the whole world to see. ;o) I have people...everywhere...if you're a subscriber and not signing in on my blog guest book...or commenting...I will find out! I don't do this for me...ok...wait...I have bi-polar...I do have inflated sense of myself...I do Blog for me...but I find if I don't do entries...I have people who will let me know so obviously there is someone by sides myself reading this.  Ok...off the soap box I go with this final statement...SIGN MY GUEST BOOK AND MAKE COMMENTS! It took hours to get those features on here!  I am practicing internet accountability and I have found that I cannot copy and paste my history folder, I actually have to type out all the places I have been. Let me tell you, there's a deterent to web surfing if there ever was one! Yes...you guested...it's e-bay. Sure I don't drink martinis (anymore...ahem) but the shaker was only 5 bucks! How can you pass up a deal like that? I think I get that from my sister who is also a major bargain hunter (Did you get that Patty? I'm talking about Jennie, don't forget to run off and tell her I said that! :o) ) If she denies it, I believe there was a time she bought a bunch of alcohol because it was a bargain; even though she doesn't DRINK! Must be a Kochackis thing. Insert 70% off, remove brain function. Speaking of martinis earlier, I really did used to drink them. Only because I thought I sounded cool and sophisticated ordering them at the bar, that or a Manhattan or Cosmopolitan. I hated each of those drinks. They were the worse things I ever tasted! But it was all about appearences...I was so shallow...well...sometimes I still am. No really, I am.  My backyard looks like a tree grave yard. A 20 foot limb here, a 15 foot limb there, my fence is now broken in two places. Fortunately I am borrowing a Chainsaw...(BIG GRIN) I've always wanted to chainsaw something. I have had no work for the last two days do to power outages', well, now that the power is back on, I can go to work finally, but I had two days that I could have been cleaning up! Not going to happen anytime soon with more freezing rain on the way #$@%#@%#! Yeah...that's right, I'm swearin' I am so sick of this stupid freezing rain. I never thought I'd say this, but I miss the snow! But all things being equal I'd rather it be spring already. I have had enough now thank you! You would never know how much power the weather can hold over a city. I watch the business, church and school closings scroll under my regularly scheduled programming like football scores during football season...well...maybe more like baseball and football scores because it takes awhile to recycle. I think the best cancellation I saw was for a church...Revival was cancelled. Now that is a powerful ice storm to overthrow the plans of the Holy Spirit and interrupt a revival! Not to meantion have it advertised that it was cancelled ahead of time.  I went over to my friends Matt & Joseph's house to see them and how they were doing because I couldn't make phone contact with them. I helped Joseph move stuff around that was displaced because of the basement flood. The whole basement was being gutted and redone. Joseph is quite an organizer. I don't know how he got all that stuff upstairs and still have room to get around, but by the time I got there he had paths through all the stuff. We would watch 15 minutes of "The Patriot" get rev-ved up and go at it then watch some more. And, much to our surprise, their dog Sadie, who has in the past been terribly upset by disruption of things in the house...didn't make a peep about it while I was there. I was amazed. You have to know this dog. See...this dog didn't eat for 4 days because the refrigerator wasn't where it was supposed to be, she barks if you open a particular drawer to a particular sewing machine desk. She is...unique. :o)  I have been reading more of my book "The God Catchers" by Tommy Tenney and I found myself marking it up more as I found myself getting totally into this book. I wanted to share some more with you. Mostly because I want to have something more profound to share than the stupid weather!  "If you ever have an encounter with the manifest presence of God, it will ruin church for you. From then on you put up with church. What you really want is, "Come on, God."... Your heavenly Father wants you to rediscover the joy of innocence and excitement at His presence. When we grow up to the aroogance of adolescence, we can't capture His heart because we think, Oh it's just You. Oh, it's just church, Oh; they're just singing another song. It's just another sermon....the process is finding and the joy of discovery. Behind every song could be a fresh discovery of His presence. When passionate pleas replace dry discourses, "church" can become the celebration of His presence it was always meant to be. He was always there waiting, but the conditions were not correct.  "For frost to appear, not only do the conditions have to be right outside...but...inside as well...When brokenness appears in ur lives, openness appears in the heavens...God will take advantage of your desperate feelings to create a dependency on Him. Thirty seconds in the manifest presence of God can change everything...it can change your destiny, and it can rearrange your future. (Or move you to KY--that's my Note) You'll never be the same...Your desperation causes you to look past the circumstances, past the veil." (The veil-referring to Holy of Holies in the temple) -- The God Chasers, Chapter 2--Burning Lips and Hot Hearts, Pages 24 and 25  Wasn't that cool? Get it...Frost...Cool...you know, they say a genius is never understood in their own time.  It's two for one day!!! Enjoy Chapters 9 & 10!  Good night and thanks for visiting!  A Working Manuscript  by Rachel Kochackis  Copyright pending 2003  No part of this manuscript may be reproduced in any form, without the express written consent of the author.   Chapter 9  When Poet and Hope Returned to the camp Teacher was waiting With Victory who was swifter.  Teacher approached Poet And motioned for her hand He gave her A leather sack and said Go forth into Futility And speak what is on your heart Find out why Your friends died here.  He approached Hope And he placed A Ring of Every Color On a chain around her neck.  He did the same to Prophet.  Poet reached into the sack She felt around inside And brought to the surface its contents  Teacher. What am I to do With a bag of chalk?  Teacher smiled Speak what is on your heart Prophet.  Hope examined The Ring of Every Color  Teacher. What does this represent for me? I have seen such a ring before but...  Teacher interrupted. The ways of God Are not the ways of man And if any one asks of you Why you wear this ring Tell them it is a symbol Of your humanity And God's covenant Not to condemn with the law But to save by grace.  Poet looked down To the ring she bore as well. Teacher? Am I to say The same of the ring?  Teacher's eyes Welled with compassion. Prophet. There is much that you Will not understand And this is one of them. I give these rings To you and Hope For you bare the same burden And you will be greatly persecuted. But yes, Ultimately you will say The same of the ring Regardless of what others May say to you.  Poet was again perplexed Are you leaving us in Futility Teacher?  Teacher reached out And touched Poet's face He took her by the hands and smiled Look at my wrists Prophet.  He bore the scars of love.  And finally Poet’s eyes were open And she realized who He was. You’re… Teacher put His fingers To her lips to quiet her And then put His hand To Poet's heart I have never once left you Prophet. Will you accept your name And go forth into Futility?   Prophet's eyes filled with tears. How can I Teacher? You know my burden And now I travel with Hope Who struggles as well. How can I be your Prophet? I can never succeed.  Teacher smiled. You're right. You can never succeed, But God can.  But Teacher...  Prophet. Fear not. For the Lord your God is with you. I will never leave you Nor forsake you.  And if I fail To deal with my burden Appropriately?  I know you don't Quite understand Prophet. Sometimes It's not where you walk But how. I know your heart And I will always love you. Keep guard over The motives of your heart And I will do the rest. That will have to be Enough for now. Go forth into Futility.  And what of Philosopher? Prophet quickly asked.  Keep guard over your motives Prophet. And keep Victory Close by on your journey.  Bark!!  Teacher smiled That's right Victory Stay close to my pupils.   Hope questioned Teacher with her eyes.  Am I to go With Prophet as well?  Teacher took Hope's hands If you must travel this road Isn't it best Not to travel alone? Though the path may be more difficult The destination is the same. And Prophet needs someone To remind her of the task. How else can you understand Your name my child? Teacher and Hope embraced I will be with you always child.  Prophet looked toward the Wall She felt a hand touch her own She turned and smiled sheepishly At the eyes that met with hers And Hope returned the smile  Let us go back into Futility As Teacher has asked I will go with you For we travel the same road.  OK Hope Prophet answered We will break camp And go back into Futility.  Chapter 10  Prophet and Victory Awoke before dawn Teacher and Hope Continued to sleep Victory greeted Prophet Who now sought Her Cloak of Many Names She stirred the embers Of the camp fire And made breakfast For herself and Victory It was still quite dark So she expected that Victory Would be her only company.  Bark!!  S-h-h-h. Victory, quiet. Prophet softly spoke As she bore Her Cloak of Many Names.  Prophet again examined The leather sack Which Teacher gave her And reached inside For one of the many Chalk fragments.  Prophet also examined The Ring of Every Color Which now hung from a chain Around her neck.  "Go forth into Futility And speak what is on your heart." Teacher's words Rang clear through her mind.  Prophet smiled Sounds pretty futile to me.  Victory approached Prophet again Sniffed the Cloak of Many Names and...  Bark!  Victory, Hush.  Victory sat before Prophet Wagging his tail As if awaiting a response To an unspoken question And then...  "What do you wear today Prophet?"  Teacher's words again spoke to Prophet's heart.  She looked at Victory with surprise. Is that what you meant Mister Victory?  Bark!  Prophet was Once again perplexed But answered aloud Just in case.    Today It is a Cloak of Observation For I am quite unsure Of my surroundings.  "Your honesty continues to serve you well Prophet."  Bark!  OK. I know Victory. Hush.  Prophet walked toward the Wall As Victory followed Finally she reached a hand out To touch the separation The red brick was rough Against her fingertips. With one palm against the stone And the other against her heart She bowed her head And cried.

      Greetings from Antartica!  A little song sung to the tune of Winter Wonderland:  In the meadow we could build a snowman... And watch as treelimbs crush his icy skull... The cops may come and ask, "Are you hurt man?"... But If I don't salt the sidewalk they might fall.  Later on...if you wanna We can smoke...some...(well you can figure out what rhymes with wanna) It's a beautiful site Though I'm jobless tonight Walkin round with chainsaws in our hands.  (See, that is what people are doing in the various neighborhoods. Walking around with chainsaws and cutting up the treelimbs in the streets)  Just a little tune that depicts the life of a Kentuckian today.  I went to my temp job this morning and as I suspected, they had no power and so I had no work today. It was so much fun doing the obstacle course today, I got to do the limbo in my jeep with all the hanging power, cable and telephone lines. Of course, I don't know which was which, and I didn't want to find out! And there were even more treelimbs blocking the roads. Some lanes you don't want to be in because the limbs were hanging so low you didn't dare chance being smashed by one. Now we are having snow covering the black ice so it is just another challenge to the drive. Even with 4-wheel drive, I did a few donuts when trying to start from a stop or turn or move. :oP I want to make this clear, I am not complaining. I am merely reporting the facts. And I do enjoy the adventure of living in a state of emergency. Oh wait. That isn't our county...yet.  I am paying for cable that I still don't have. And I can't get through to ask when I will have service again. At least I have heat, electricity, water, a roof and a phone. I'm one of the lucky ones. I can live without cable. But I wish I had an antenna.  I worked out today to the point of absolute exhaustion and nausea. Now, that is always my goal. Arnold Swartzenegger never quit until he threw up. I'm not that extreme, but I do really push to get results. If I'm going to put the time into muscle building, I'm going all out! Basically, since I wasn't feeling to well yesterday with the lack of sleep I missed a days workout. I was trying to make up for it today. I break up my workout into chest & shoulders, Legs, and Back and arms. I missed leg day. The hardest day. So, I made it up today and got through about 1/2 of my back workout when I just was spent and ready to hurl. I'm not the smartest person in the world, but I took that as a sign that I needed to stop. I could finish up later, I have 3 more back exercises and a couple of arm exercises and then I'm done for the week!!! I know...so what. I just thought I'd share that part of my life. I want you all to bug me and ask how I'm doing so I will be accountable to someone besides me. I've been doing the treadmill unless I do some other major exercise like that friggin' dance game! Sheesh...I thought I was going to die when I got home. I am so out of shape! But, the more I do, the more that will improve. I want to be ready for warmer weather and beautiful hiking days! I am drinking one of those gosh aweful protein drinks. Anything to do what I need to do. I am back to the basics. They aren't meant to be weight-loss products, but I can never eat much after having one of these. Well, actually you have to have two, one after the workout and one 3 hours later...today I may have 4 because I may do a second workout. Glad I only plan on having weight training days 3 times a week. I hate this stuff...but it's the best way to get the protein I need without spending a lot of money on steaks or drinking raw eggs! I know, exciting.  I have yet another huge limb in my yard. Anyone need some fire wood? Come on by, you cut it, you keep it! Or maybe I might have a bon-fire. :o) All my peeps in KY, come on by, we'll have, as you say, a Big Ol' Time! You bring the shine. Ha ha.  I have a new weight bench to go with my total gym. Now, I like my total gym, but I couldn't get a good bench press on it. It's probably me, but I just like a good old fashion bench press with a bar. I didn't plan this, but it came with a leg extension and leg curl, and I can attach a preacher curl pad. FYI, a preacher curl is so named because the pad looks like one of those things you would kneel and pray at and so it got the name preacher curl. I know, you thought it was because someone stood over you and told you what to do...well...I used to do that to people when I trained so that is partially true! :o)  So, with my treadmill, I don't need no stinkin gym now. My Total Gym and my new bench is just about everything I need with the exception of a few more dumbbells later on down the line. I had quite a time putting that bench together. It warned me that I needed two people to do it. HA. I am a rock...I am an island...I am an idiot! I got it together by myself because you just do foolish things like that when you are house bound and have no cable. So, I am pretty proud of myself. I just used the window ledge where I needed an extra hand. It said I needed a rubber mallet, a rachet set, an adjustable wrench, a set of open and closed end wrenches, a flat head and philips screwdriver and lubricant. I didn't need any of that crap! I used an adjustable wrench, a butter knife, a weak power drill with a rachet attachment, and some WD 40. Where I needed the rubber mallet, I just banged the item against the rug. It's totally put together and safe. I used it today for my leg work out and if it can hold me up, it's pretty solid!  Stephanie from Iowa City voted on my poll yesterday and was quick to inform me that I had better had seen Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure and their Bogus journey. That was her pick for all time greatest movie. Hey, I know that Gangus Khan totally wrecked havoc on his enemies and on Oshman's Sporting Goods, and that he loves twinkies because of the gnarly sugar rush. Now Stephanie, I would like to know one thing...who are you and how did you find my Blog? Am I becoming known beyond my personal sphear of influence? COOL! I appreciate your visiting please tell me more about yourself. Sign in again in my guest book!  I've been reading the God Catchers. Now, I'm not one to go with a trend. See, this is a sequel to the God Chasers which was a very popular book. Frankly, it was on sale at Kroger (that's a grocery store) for 5 bucks, along with its workbook and a devotional all 5 bucks each. It was a regular pizza hut sale (regular price, 5 bucks, 5 bucks, 5 bucks) anyway...sorry about that...it's difficult to keep my attention on one thing. I wanted to share a bit from the book. I thought it was pretty cool what I have read so far about the character of God. The author, Tommy Tenney, gives an account of playing hide and seek with his little girl and how God doesn't hide to not be found, but leaves evidence of Himself to keep us seeking and eventually to find Him. So, Tenney describes this time of hide and seek with his daughter: "I tracked her every step as she looked for me in all the strange places that seem so logical from a toddler's point of view. I listened from my hiding place behind a closet door as she looked for me in the oven, in the trash bin, and in the ridiculously crowded space under the kitchen sink...If it was clear that my petite pursuer was having trouble finding me, then I would be careful to leave something showing to help her along. If I was behind the closet door, then I'd make sure part of my foot was showing. If I took refuge behind the couch, then I'd make sure that just enough of my backside showed to help her find me...the point to our elaborate game of hidey-face wasn't the hiding; it was the finding!...I was careful to hide so that she could find me." In the sharing of this author's intimate play with his daughter, I began to realize how detatched I am from not only God but humanity in general. I am not really in touch with my feelings much less have the ability to receive love. I cried reading this. I could almost relate but it was just beyond my heart and I knew it. I wanted that to change. And I laughed at the places his little girl looked for him because I knew darn well I do the same thing in seeking God. I open up my happy meal, peer inside and ask, God? Are you in there? Just thought I'd share that bit of insight I received.  Now...finally...here is the next installment of my manuscript. Enjoy!  A Working Manuscript  by Rachel Kochackis  Copyright pending 2003  No part of this manuscript may be reproduced in any form, without the express written consent of the author.   Chapter 8  Here Poet Philosopher continued Drink from this.  Philosopher handed her A small silver vial  Poet took the vial Opened it And smelled the contents The odor made her mouth water And her stomach nauseous  It smells quite bitter Surely it must be poison And if I ask the contents How can I be sure you are truthful?  Life is risk Poet Are you afraid to live?  No. I am afraid to trust you.  Philosopher smiled But can you really trust anyone? Even yourself? He pointed To Poet's bandages and continued The liquid you hold in your hand Has no name Some say it was milked From the Root of Bitterness Others claim That it awakens your senses But I believe You will find both to be true. Either way The words you will discover Out weigh the risk Poet Remember: "At what price does beauty unfold..."  Yes Philosopher But pain is a costly muse And your continual quoting of my poetry Is both flattering and haunting I must admit I am perplexed.  And just as Poet Finished this thought A flash of gray fur Lunged from the darkness Victory attacked Philosopher.  Get him off of me! Philosopher exclaimed  Victory stood with his full weight On Philosopher's chest Awaiting Poet's word.  Here Philosopher, Poet tossed back the vial I will ask Victory to release you And then I ask That you leave. Understood?  Understood. Philosopher groaned Please release me.  OK Thank you Victory All is well Let the man go.  Victory obeyed And Philosopher Sheepishly returned To the darkness from whence he came.  Hope ran up to the scene Just as Victory Pinned Poet to the ground Lapping her face With great joy As if seeing A long lost friend.  Victory! I'm happy to see you too Calm down!  Hope laughed I thought you were in danger So I sent Victory I wonder now Who you need protection from.  Victory released Poet.  Hope looked around Where is Philosopher?  I don't know Poet answered.  I don't know why Prophet But I didn't trust him.  Poet thought silently for a moment And then said He flattered me with my own words For that reason He both frightened …And enticed me.  Do you think he will be back Prophet?  I believe there is still much to settle Hope But not tonight Let's return to camp And speak with Teacher.

      OK, I have two words to sum up my weekend: Ice Storm.  This is my first one, and I am a stupid Californian who doesn't know any better than to drive out in the middle of it all, around the really fun obstacle courses of downed trees, powerlines, no traffic signals, and black ice! You think I would have clued in this morning as I passed through all this just to get to church to find no one else was there. Duh! On top of that, I shot a whole roll of film of all the downed limbs, powerlines, police blockades, the 3/4 of an inch of ice surrounding the tree in my front yard and on the mirror of my jeep.  My friends Matt and Joseph came home to a flood in their basement. I guess with all the power outages, they had trouble with their Sump Pump....heck I don't know what it's called...I just know it was off too long and caused flooding. So, they aren't too happy right now, I'm sure.  I may still have a Miata when this is all said and done. I keep it covered and the cover is sheer ice. Blocks of ice are pounding it and several have broken through my bad window. I mean it punched through, like punching through a piece of paper, not ripping...punched!  I am supposed to start my temp job tomorrow, and I have no idea if I'll be able to get there or not. It depends on whether there are trees in the way.  I am sorry that I haven't written, I was facing black outs and possible trees coming through my roof. I keep hearing crackle crackle, pop, snap, roar CRASH! That is the sound of the ice breaking more limbs and splintering ice onto surrounding roofs. And in the background besides this constant noise I can hear the constant wail of sirens. Fire trucks and ambulances. It is quite erie. Now I know what it must be like to hear glaciers break and fall into the ocean. It's happening all around my neighborhood. It is altogether beautiful and dangerous. And, goody goody...I get to be out in it again tomorrow morning!  My dogs like it. They have been running in with various shapes of ice in their little mouths. Once, Mike had a piece too big for the doggy door and it shattered as he tried to leap through into the house. I wish I had a video camera...the look on his face was one of utter disappointment and complete amazement...where'd it go!!!  I have no cable, so I missed the 300th episode of the Simpsons! I am so $#@! And I couldn't rig up an antenna to try to catch it on broadcast so I am #%#!@! And I'm going to miss Law & Order and Kingpin tonight and that makes me really %#@#!  Anyone on the westcoast tape it?  So, that's the latest. I'd better post while I still have power and phone services!  More later.  And thanks for Bloggin along with me.

       Hello my friend we meet again, It's been awhile so where should we begin?   Oh great, now I got Creed stuck in my brain. Or, I think that was from a Creed song -- My Sacrifice? I'm sure one or many of you will correct me if I'm wrong. :o)  Just thought I'd let you all know, if I don't blog, it's because I got lazy or busy and I'm not dead. But thanks for being so concerned. Really. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy knowing so many people care whether or not I put my bizzare ramblings out for the world to see. Makes me wonder why I'm the one who's medicated, but hey, if I can make you smile just once then that's great! :oD  I thought I'd share a special treat with you all. Now, some of you purchased my poetry book "The Yosemite Diaries." (Copies are still available, just e-mail me) But I thought I'd share 2 poems from that diary that didn't get published due to lack of space and money.  So here they are, without much fanfair (what is fanfair/fanfare anyway?)   Temptation  A Poem from the original Yosemite Diaries manuscripts. by Rachel Kochackis Copyright pending 2003  No part of this poem may be reproduced in any form, without the express written consent of the author.   Oh fickel human heart! Will contentment Satisfy thee? Adorned with Perfect Love Yet your appetite cries MORE! Though I feast From day to night The flesh will not be full Another lovely face In your gallery of Excess. And even if I find Another heart as mine I could never stay true For I would be torn Between a God Who's love reigns And a heart I have No right to own. --------------------------   Broken  A Poem from the original Yosemite Diaries manuscripts. by Rachel Kochackis Copyright pending 2003  No part of this poem may be reproduced in any form, without the express written consent of the author.   Exhaustion embraces Like a warm, opiate-friend. I stumble through reality Which only God trandscends. I know now I am broken; I haven't any fight. Save me from self-destruction And I will follow You. Now in my nakedness Submission blankets me. My weakness covered by Your love I have no strength to resist. Love me as I've longed for And show me when You do. For life away from You Has stolen any reference to Hope. Beaten senseless By the waves of circumstance; I confuse Love For Hate. Not unlike A Lamb in anguish Bitting the hand that heals.  Ok, talk about being vulnerable with you all. These are some poems I was afraid to publish for fear of being misunderstood. Well, there are a few more like them, but I thought I'd let you slip these on and see how they felt. :o)  I am glad that God gave me a poet's heart. It's one of the few things I have to express myself. I don't know if anyone else likes what I write or even understands what I'm trying to say. But I know I'll never know, if I don't share what I write with others. And this is my blog, and I can do whatever I want! :oP  Speaking of poets...where did I leave you all off at? Chapter 10? So I should give you Chapter 11 now, right? What the heck, I'll give you Chapter 12 too! I hope you all continue to enjoy it.  Hasta la bye-bye for now.  Keep on Bloggin'!  A Working Manuscript by Rachel Kochackis Copyright pending 2003 No part of this manuscript may be reproduced in any form, without the express written consent of the author.  Chapter 11  The sun was starting to rise When Prophet finally looked up And toward the horizon Her tears blurred The pink and purple sky.  Her fingers found The Ring of Every Color Close to her heart As she removed her hand from the Wall.  How was she to now face Hope?  And Teacher's words rang out again "I will never leave you nor forsake you."  Prophet returned to camp With Victory close behind She had promised That they'd set out for Futility at dawn.  Hope had already packed up camp And Prophet saw Teacher Was no where to be found  He was gone when I awoke And I was afraid you left me too Hope ran and embraced Prophet And Victory was quick to join the two.  Prophet held her close He hasn't left us Hope.  Hope released Prophet From her embrace  Prophet brushed the tears From Hope's eyes And putting one hand Over her own heart said He's right here.  And as Hope mimicked Prophet She tearfully asked And here?  Prophet smiled and nodded And Hope embraced her again.  Some time passed when Prophet heard  Bark!  Prophet pulled away from Hope  I know Victory Keep guard over the motives of my heart.  Hope was amazed How do you know what he said?  I don't Prophet confessed Yet I can't explain why He brings to mind Teacher's words either So I guess I won't try.  The Ring of Every Color Which hung around Hope's neck Now called out For Prophet's attention.  Hope. Why didn't you tell me That we share the same nature?  I thought you knew already The way you looked at me The night we met Philosopher And my reaction to your sorrow... I just thought you knew.  I did. Prophet answered But hearing you say it Would just have confirmed it.  So are we still going back Prophet?  At this point Hope I don't know what else We can do.  And with that Prophet, Hope and Victory Returned to the city of Futility.  Chapter 12  Once again in Futility Prophet, Hope and Victory Happened upon One of many yearly festivals  Today they watched The Festival of Colors And many took to the streets.  Other citizens of Futility Looked on With amusement, indifference or support.  Prophet took special note Of those who marched today And Hope voice the observation Prophet had feared she would discover today.  Look Prophet They too bare The Ring of Every Color! Shall we join the festival?  No. Prophet responded. Today I bare A Cloak of Observation And observation Does not require participation. Besides One thing does intrigue me.  What? Hope asked.  They bare The Ring of Every Color This is true However They wear it upon Their left ring finger Of Promise And not upon a chain As we do.  They may also bare it For reasons different Than what Teacher gave us. Surely We shall not join them.  Hope looked disappointed Yet she agreed with Prophet's observations Shall we then observe And see where they march to?  Very well. Prophet answered I would like to see For whom and for what they march.  Growl!!  What is it Victory? Prophet asked  Victory's eyes were fixed Upon a member of the crowd But Prophet could not see Victory's new found enemy.  Easy Victory  We'll be cautious Hope Victory doesn't Normally respond like this Except to Philosopher.  Do you see him Prophet?  No. But the night he appeared Victory attacked him And upon reliving that night Prophet continued Victory doesn't like him And I don't trust him.  Hope stepped into the street To follow the marchers And Prophet pulled her back.  We can follow from the sidewalk We mustn't align ourselves With what we do not know Hope.  Hope again looked disappointed But saw Prophet's point She realized She was getting caught up In the festive mood Which seemed To intoxicate the crowd.  Let us watch But from a distance Hope. If Philosopher is here... Well, for now, let's keep our distance.  Thank you Victory We'll observe But you watch for Philosopher.  Victory Stood on his hind legs And lapped Prophet's face With great joy.  I'm glad Teacher Let you come with us too Prophet gleefully responded As she hugged Victory.  Hope looked at Prophet As if to ask a question And Prophet responded To her unspoken statement.  I don't know Hope I just understand Victory And I can't explain how. Just like I don't know How sometimes I know your heart.  Hope and Prophet were silent a moment. Just to ponder.  OK Prophet broke the silence. Let's see where they march to.

      OK...OK...I am very sorry, My loyal My Not So Secret Life readers, for not blogging for so long. I started a temp job and failed miserably! I have to get this whole meds thing straightened out with my DR. because I am a wreck with or without them. To quote one of my favorite groups, U2,  "...With or without you...I can't live...with or without you"  You meaning the drugs.  I finally got the whole tree mess taken care of thanks to Tara and her husband Joel. (Hi Tara!) I understand she comes by and reads my blog too now and then.  I started my very first on-line class this week. My first e-class is Wed at 10 p.m. est. I love being able to go to school in my P.J.s, of course I have a friend who has gone to church in slippers and a robe, but I won't name names boo boo... ;o) I have a lot of stuff to read, memorize and...math. Yes, algebra has reared its ugly head and has re-entered my life as if to say, "HA HA HA you thought you were finally rid of me, huh?" But, the book puts it into terms I can understand and explains that these improper fractions (which have required some improper thinking on my part) are really just drug recipes. That's right, they said that, drug recipes. Of course, that got my attention. Let me share some of my applications and knowledge with you, my loyal readers.  The book gave the example of 10mg/2ml explaining that the numerator (in this case 10 mg of a drug) is the drug in question, and denominator (2ml) is the vehicle by which that the drug is delivered. So my application from a real drug recipe: 1oz/1lb or one ounce of Marijuana for every one pound of butter. That was my recipe, well ingredience, for THC butter which I would make cookies with. Of course we are dealing with various weights and measures and they go into that as well, but I was finding that perhaps my scheming little mind had found a home of it's own in pharmacy. I can so "go there," you know? Now, before I am inidated with e-mail (yeah right) I no longer make the aforementioned butter or cookies anymore so don't ask me for the recipe or the instructions unless you send me 100 dollars U.S. After the check clears, I'll send you the instructions. But in no way do I encourage, use or endorse the use of marijuana I am merely passing on old information. :oD Actually, I am hoping that this all just gave everyone a big laugh and now we can move on.  Yes, so now I know what my oxycodone w/APAP really is. It says it's 5mg/325mg which from my new studies I have learned means 5mg of morphine for every 325mg of acetometophen (aka tylenol) or there is 5mg of morphine in each 325mg tablet. Cool, huh, and this is only my second day! I am so smart, I am so smart, everybody loves me, I am so smart. (self-assessment-increasing sense of over-inflated self-worth) You know, there must be a fine line between mania and self esteem and I find myself pole valuting over it daily!  I know, I sound obsessed with drugs right now, but you spend the last 4 hours studying about them and see if you don't talk about them.  OK, now, the moment you all have been waiting for...the results of my weekly poll (which yes I am changing ASAP)  The winner is: The Princess Bride!  Out of 18 votes it got 5, followed by "other" with 4 votes, etc and so forth.  Well boys and girls, that's all the time I have to blog today.  I have a new lunch time poll up and ready to be voted on!!!  Until next blog, which I hope won't be so delayed!  This is Rachel, blogging off. (boy that could sound really bad if you wanted it too. :oD )

      Thank you for all your patience as I am adjusting to school life again...even if it is via the internet...I'm the one who still has to do the studying!  I always watch the titles of the new Blogs that get posted, I like the name of this one: The Psych Ward Inside My Head. I don't know what it's about, so if you go and it's like all dark or offensive, I'm sorry. I just like the name. It fits my committee in my head.  Yes, I have a committee in my head. And the committee makes up Rachel. I have spoken about the committee before, only I mentioned one voice, and that would be Homer Simpson. His voice is the voice of my flesh or my ultimate cravings (Ummmm...donuts) A famous Homerism besides D'Oh!, which by the way is an offical word in the Oxford English Dictionary. Yes, that's how you spell it, it's actually a contraction, of what two words, only Matt Groening knows.  I'm trying a different medication for sleep tonight so if I start really sounding weird...well...wait...I guess no one would be able to tell, I'll just have more typos and spelling errors than usual.  I have been working out a lot these last two weeks and I am up to 15-20 minutes on my treadmill. I am totally exhausted. I can barely type. I finished all three of my weight training routines 3 days in a row, which is doable, but difficult. Now I can focus on the treadmill the rest of the week. The most important thing in fitness is happening to me again, my mindset is changing. I am starting to believe I can really gain the level of fitness I once had. That has been my number one obstacle. I was reading a magazine (Muscle Media) and they had a great article on setting your mind on your goals. It said you must enter this with purpose. That I merely don't just have a goal (because I can fail at my goals and not give it another thought, I don't know about the rest of you.) but to view it like you are making your rent or mortage payment. It's something you have to do. That is something you do without question. Why not take care of my health with the same mindset, and "make my payments" so to speak. The next point was Maturity, which for me equals delayed gratification. If I can learn to not only believe in my ability to "make my payments" then I will learn to delay my gratification. (In other words, I won't mac out on sweets just because I screwed up anyway.) I won't bore you all with the rest, but I found that not only can these things apply to fitness training, but to my life as a whole, spiritually, emotionally, physically, mentally...did I leave anything out...sorry...the klonopin is having it's affect. I'm starting to feel pretty good...did I say I was confused by legal drugs vs. illegal ones...well...I'm not confused anymore...this one's pretty good. ;o) (I'm kidding by the way...well..sort of...sheesh...like truth serum!)   I just looked in the mirror. And things aren't lookin' so good. I'm lookin' California. But feelin' Minesota...oh yeah.  That was from a song by Soundgarden (which I think is a very cool name for a band) It just kinda sprung in my head, that line, like a little musical flower and the committee wanted to know, what the heck does lookin' California but feelin' Minesota mean anyway? It sounds cool. Maybe that's all there is to it and I shouldn't try to read too much into it.  I'm looking over at my dogs who are both snuggly tucked into my bed. Well, they think it's their bed. I tell you, with cold weather, little dogs are the best bed warmers! Mike (My Boston Terrier) likes to sleep at my feet under the covers, which is great because my feet get cold and they go on him. He's such a good dog. He just lies there, snoring...very very loud. (I know...I should talk...yeah yeah yeah).  Wednesday is Ash Wednesday and it reminds me of how glad I am to be 2600 miles away from home during Easter. See, my family has this strange tradition that if any of the rest of you do it or have heard of, comment on this please. See for weeks before Easter, my family, my aunt's family, all my older cousins and their families would save the egg shells from breakfast by only cracking the very top part of the egg and save the shell with the hole in the top.  Then, like a week before Easter all us kids would make confetti, fill the eggs, and tape them closed. Then on Easter (after we all went to Mass of course) we would have our Easter egg hunt followed by the smashing of these confetti eggs into each other's hair. Yes, you read that correctly, we smashed these things into each other's hair. So, Easter brings both a time of joy and lingering fear left over from childhood. That anticipation that someone's going to get me. Can you blame me, for nearly 25 years I had this tradition condition me to be that way. I still have a lot of therapy to go, but with time and my medication, I think I'll be a survivor of all this. Really. :oP  Well...This stuff is really working and I can barely type cohertly anymore...well...I'm sure you didn't notice but you'll have to take my word for it.  Good night everyone...or good morning (to my a.m. readers)...or good afternoon to my lunch time friends. I hope you found todays blog entertaining. I'll get the next chapters to you all, I have to fish them off the laptop. It might be awhile. :o)  By the way, my comments link is acting funny. Be patient. I think the server is down or something. So please comment, and comment often. Even if it is just to say I'm WRONG! :oD  Blogging On

      Oh my gosh. My dog Mike is like farting so much, his gas could heat this house! I don't know what that dog's been eatting but man, my eyes are watering! And worse yet, he farts then runs out the room so he don't have to smell it. The little punk.  Last night was my e-class. I was class clown. As always. I got promised two cookies because I was smart and worked ahead of everyone. I got extra credit. I was teacher's pet. Such the paradox again. The brightest and the biggest trouble maker all in one. Guess that's why none of my profs or teachers could ever figure me out.  I am about to finish my weight training for the week. I worked my legs yesterday. I worked so hard that I had to nap for 3 hours to recover. I think it was because I gave a pint of blood the day before. I am going to do my back and arms now. So I am going to take advantage of my energy and time and do this now.  Sorry this is so short, but at least it is timely!  More later.

      I'm baaacck! I have been studying my little brain to a frazzle...sorry there hasn't been much left to write with. I figured by now there would be an uproar if I didn't put something!  SOMETHING  Ha...just kidding.  Thank you for all the comments and votes and I'm glad my poem helped you "score" Mark. (That's my brother) By the way Mark, our cuz, Patty reads these things...you in trouble! ;o)  Those of you who have been keeping up with Matt's Blog, yes, I am the one who left the lead based Mexican produced chili crap candy at the house. But I never told anyone to eat one. Except MJ. :oP And now that I have explained my family's bizzare Easter Rites...I imagine I'm going to be picking egg shells from my hair this Easter judging from the comments... :o) I hope not.  I went to The Psych Ward Inside My Head blog, and her name is Rachel too. Well, she misspells her name, Rachael. Weird.   Today I did what are called super-sets. I am so tired. Basically, you find a weight you can do a max of 5 reps and do 5 sets with about 5 minutes rest in between. Oh My Gosh! I thought I was gonna die. I discovered a new fitness philosophy, push it or die! I almost dropped the big olympia bar on me because I thought I got it on the spotter, I just missed it, but God was looking out for me because I got it back up there. Man, what a work out. I do better when my life's in danger. :oP By Thursday I won't be able to move.  I gave blood today. (No, not by dropping a dumbbell on me) I went to the Central KY Blood Bank and I gave them a pint and they gave me another shirt. Man, those shirts are expensive. I finally didn't have low iron the first round. I always have to go back like 5 times because my irons low. Not any more, not since I have been on the (Arnold Imitation) Arnold Swartzenegger route to happiness and fitness. (By the way, he's one of the voices in my committee too...don't be a sissy girl...push da weight...come on...my granma con lift more than you) Ah...my own personal trainer. And a celeb too...but don't tell anyone...he's shy. And I'm on my meds so you can't do anything about it!  My relationship with klonopin is still going strong. We spice it up with serequel. Oh...such a lovely...spacy combination with a hint of oblivion. Fabulous colors, wonder sounds...and the music...can you see the music...Shut up...don't type that...sorry...ok Rachel again. Sorry about the mutiny.  I have gone past the point of no return in removing the clutter and thus removing the stress from my life. I have a long way to go still. I'm picky. But boy, is my room clean!  As for the result of my weekly poll. It would seem that all of you think I could do just about anything. Which both flatters and frightens me. But the winner so far, with two votes is...Pet Psychic. My brother thought I should be an armoured car driver and "accidentally" lose a bag of money while driving down a deserted road and he was following. That idea is to say the least interesting, and to say the most a felony! But it sure would be nice, if he shared the wealth.  Well, I'm off to learn brand from generic drugs...happy happy joy joy.  Be excellent to each other...and party on dudes! :oP

      Hello everyone!  I just when online to my courses where you can take self-assessment test to see how the material is sinking in. Well, let me tell you. I had fallen behind a bit because there are all these medical terms I have to learn. So I thought, what the heck, I'll see what I know then study and do better, right? We can take the tests as much as we want. Well, no joke, I did all 5 tests and aced everyone of them with out getting past the "B"s of our list of words to learn so far as studying them. I guess I am a fish in water. I am so happy because now, I am ahead. God has gifted me with understanding root words and stuff and all of the tests were so simple to me. They were multiple guess, but, still, for not having looked any of them up, I could figure them out from the answers given and the root words. Maybe I am on the right path after all.  Now all I have to do is learn all the top 250 brand/generic name drugs and what they are for, and pass my first 6 week section final and I am done...until the next 6 week module.  I have really enjoyed the last few days of sunshine. I wish it were sunny again. We have rain now, but the temp is a comfy 70. Why can't we have the sun and 70 at the same time? Well, not yet. Soon.  Today is leg day. I can't put it off any longer. I dred it actually. I have to work my legs twice as hard as my upper body because my legs are so strong. Joseph helped my find a bike on Sat. I have an indoor trainer for it, so after I'm done with legs I'm gonna bike and get used to a bike with gears and stuff. That oughta wipe them out!  So, I know I haven't said anything very profound, but at least I posted something new.  I hope to have better things to say soon.  Thanks for stopping by today!

      Alright, so many questions those of you want me to address on my blog.  First of all, I don't have an opinion or a concern about the war in Iraq. I believe it is out of my hands and I am trusting that what ever comes of it God will ultimately be in control. But, if I do have any strong feelings it is this, if we are going to do this, finish the job this time or don't bother.  The French not agreeing with the US, so what. What do they have to offer, stinky cheese and great Champaign. Well, I do love Brea.  Junior Seau leaving the Chargers. I am heart broken. A part of me has died. The darkside is biding be to trade in all my Chargers stuff for Raiders gear. I know this is all part of the plan to take my team from San Diego and give it to LA. I don't know that I can be an LA Chargers fan. But I'll cross that bridge when I get there. I knew they couldn't do it with Junior on the team, now that he's gone, it makes it a bit easier. No more home town hero.  I had a most interesting weekend. Of course you all know I have been hitting the books and the weights really hard. But Friday, I got to take a road trip with Joseph and Matt to the nearest Krispy Kreme donut shop, 2 hours away in Louisville on Friday. See, I have never had a "fresh" Krispy Kreme and apparently, I couldn't live another day without the experience. So, at 11:45 pm on Friday, we all pile into Joseph's car (I drove) and Road Trip! With being in classes again it was like having those college experiences I never had. We got there, had a lot of donuts and I had a lot of coffee, then we went to Indiana so we could stop at a park on the other side of, I believe the Ohio river, to see the skyline of Louisville. It was lovely. Then, we drove back and got home by around 3 am. Matt was our DJ, he picked some good traveling tunes. I expected that, he is so musically gifted.  Sunday, the weather was too beautiful so I had to go for another drive. I went to the place Matt showed us because it was by this place called the falls of the Ohio. Basically, it is a bunch of locks they open and close, I guess to control the flow of the river. Well, when the water's down, there are all these cool fossils and stuff but when you hear a siren blast, run like hell, they're opening the locks and the waters gonna come rushing back in. I heard the siren, but I was driving away at the time. The water was raging so I didn't get to see any of the cool fossils. Definanately going back though.  Then today, my friend here, Christy, had lost her dog Ashton. She called me this morning and told me and I offered to help her look. We prayed and prayed. Prayed that some how our paths would cross. Now, most of you don’t know where Christy lives, but it’s like all pastures and creeks, river beds, trees. Looking for a fat little Beagle in all that was like looking for a needle in a haystack.  So, we went to post more flyers. I said, I'm going to the Grocery store here, they always post stuff like this. Low and behold, there was a flyer about a found dog, call and describe. It was Ashton and she was just down the street! We had found her in less than 2 hours. I was so stoked to be used by God like that and to know how important even a dog is to a dear child of his. It also made me think of the great rejoicing He does when He finds one who is lost. I almost cried. It was the miraculous in the ordinary. And I was honored to have witnessed it.  That's the latest from Lexington Central. I'm beat. And I have more studying to do. Thanks for reading. I'll try to keep up with this better.  Love to all!  Rachel

      My brother Mark admitted to me he doesn't know what the NCAA is. He knows not about basketball (pausing for gasps, shock, horror to set in) Yes. We San Diegeans know little about basketball, this is true. Sometime in my life time we lost our only pro basketball team, (if you can call them pro) The Clippers to LA. I believe before them, and before I was born, we had the Rockets who are now in Houston, but I could be wrong about that.  I grew up with Baseball and Football. Of course we didn't know about the NCAA, final four or March Madness (copyrighted names by the way) except when pizza places suddenly started running specials in March for some unknown reason. No, it hasn't been until last year, when I signed the Kentucky Covenent and swore that within the next 4 years I would bleed blue, I would!! It came over me like a blue fungus. And now, since last years football games, I have been following and enjoying Univ. of KY wildcats and all the things that make the world a KY Blue place. (Hey Mark, Ashley Judd is a big big UK fan!!)  No, my dear fellow bloggers, my brother is not an NCAA fan. Why should he be? He's still in California where people can have a life outside of sports. That's why none of our pro teams ever have the backing unless they're winning. I mean, why else would my brother even think to pick any team besides Kentucky. Please forgive my brother, he is ignorant. :o)  I am reminded, of course, of the Simpsons. If there is a Doctorate program out there for the Simpsons, let me know. I want to be a Dr. of Simpsonology. So, I am reminded of the episode where Homer joins a cult. The Leader. They get him by singing Leader to the Batman TV series theme song...na na na na na na na Leader...na na na na na na na na Leader...Leader...Leader...Leader. Lisa asks Homer, Dad, have you been brainwashed? And he says, of course I haven't been brain...Kill the girl...kill the girl!  I think that explains everything in regard to my sudden loyalty to UK. Of course, it is strange. This feeling that I might actually be rooting for a championship team. I am not used to that. Unless you count the Soccers but none of you in San Diego seemed to really think they counted as a pro team so maybe not. (Look, this Lima Bean looks like the Leader!)--Simpson reference again. I mean, what do I do if the Wildcats actually...win. I mean, I have never experienced that before. Being a fan of a winning team. I, I am just a little confused. A bit like a deer in the headlights. A bit dazed at what exactly does winning a championship...mean. I know what losing is like. Being a Bolthead...you get used to losing the close ones...being the almost made it team. But actually winning...boy...that's going to take some getting used to.  Sorry, I haven't anything very profound to say. But next, I will let you enjoy the poetic stylings of one of my dearest friends back in San Diego. Kristy has e-mailed me a poem. It will be in my next blog entry.  Take care. Until next blog!

      (NEW POST---NEW WARNING--The following post may contain graphic language which my offend some of my readers. Readers discrection adviced--strongly.) That will get you to read this one! :o)  It dawned on my how perfect my dogs have taught me unconditional love. We all know that dogs love unconditionally, that's nothing new. But I am learning that I am loving them unconditionally too, and the really cool thing is, I think it's filtering into all of my relationships.  Mike. I love Mike. He's just, Mike. He's hyped up and focused when he wants to be, and totally laid back when he's not. He's got a lot of qualities, I wish I had. I am talking about, Mike, My Boston Terrier here. See, I want his focus. When we play soccer, his eyes never-NEVER leave the ball. I can't even kick it unless I do a back kick to do it. Mike LOVES the soccer ball. He will jump shoulder height to try to knock it out of my hand. I am 5 foot 1, I don't know how high that is, but this is from a stand still. He out jumps Victoria (Air Vic--as she was dubbed by my sista MJ) by at least 2 feet. He will go for that ball until he drops. That is why we can only play soccer in 5 minute intervals. I have to hide the ball from him. He will not drink water or rest until he can no longer focus on his objective. The soccer ball. I want Mike's focus. Maybe not quite the intensity, I already have that.  Mike is just all that. And he loves Victoria even though they don't always get along. They rough house and get a bit intense. But when I call her and she doesn't come in, he goes and herds her into the house for me. He is the sweetest thing. I love him very much. Farts, snores, and stinkiness and all. I even have grown to love him more for his ways. We can't really help that he farts, and he has no social graces, he'll just let me and Victoria have it and keep right on sleeping. And I laugh. Then he starts snoring and I think it's cute. And he's kinda stinky cause we played hard today. But I hug him and smile thinking how much I love him. Then it dawns on me. If I ever get married, this is basically how much I need to accept this guy I am going to spend the rest of my life with. Farts, snores, and stinkiness and all. And hey, I know I'm not perfect. Boy, my dogs know I'm not perfect, they are my little shadows witnessing every moment of my life. As I continued to think in dog terms. I was, interestingly enough, born in the year of the dog in the chinese calender...making me a dog by their zodiac. I don't put much stock in that sort of thing, but when I read the character of this sign, it fits me. It does. And I know I can be, pardon the expression, but speaking in technical terms Victoria is a bitch because she is a female dog, and boy can I acted like one! See...I warned you all. But it's true. I'm trying to make sure I make the grounds look level here between the genders because we both are imperfect. I could have said that instead, but my way was just more comical and colorful, and I think memorable. So, I got to find a guy who I can love like Mike and who can love me in return even though I can be really difficult, stubborn, moody and fart, snore and stink too...yeah...this is gonna get me a guy...listing all that!!  Mike's not perfect. He's very selfish and likes to eat Victoria's food if she doesn't first. He is always thinkin of his tummy. But I still love him. So I guess I put marriage in my life into a simple equation. I have to find a guy I can love like Mike and who will love me back the same way even if I can be more like Victoria. And that's all I'm gonna say about that.  I don't know if I'll be married or not. It doesn't matter. I want what's best for me. And if it involves marriage, I also want what's best for my future husband. Because it is then I'd start having to not be so selfish, and consider another I love dearly. What does the future hold for me. God only knows, cause I sure don't. I can't even stay gainfully employed yet. :oP  I thought I'd give you all something a little lighter to ponder today.

      (WARNING--The following blog entry may give some of you the concern that I am deeply depressed and teetering on the edge. I am not. As Alanis Moresette said in her song, "I am aware now.")  A letter about the precious.  I invested far too much time, energy, and money-seeking, finding and buying time with my precious.  I did things I don’t like to do, just to be with you. My precious.  I threw myself so in the role to seduce the keepers of the precious, that I drunk myself into a stupor, I was like them now.  Why?  It is as if, just to know I am in possession of you, I feel physically, emotionally, and spiritually relieved.  I spent time with people, like it was nothing today. Total strangers that I invested, no, risked, things of great value with. People who I knew the eternity of hours.  I know now my addiction, my precious.  It is you.  And I only see you clearly when you are with me, not away.  You have become my ultimate experience.  You give me a perception that I view life better, more focused, and everything is more enjoyable with you. I exist because I am with you. I feel more alive because I believe I can truly feel again when I am with you. It is as if I were reborn each time we are together.  And my exposure to you is corrupting me, more and more. Like radiation, sickening my spirit. And I have no control. You are like suicide with antifreeze. It tastes so sweet, but it is so deadly.  I am living a custom in Thailand. See, Thailand means freedom. And they have a custom that is considered merciful and meritorious to buy and release caged birds. I am like that bird. Captured, bought at a price, released and then snared again to be bought and released again at another time. I am living the illusion of freedom.  I see it now. I see it all clearly. But it took another touch. Just a taste of you, the precious.  And I cant seem to let you go. It is as though I want to consume you, what you are, and make it forever a part of me. And I am frantic and anxious if you are no where around. I want to know I can reach out and feel you at a moments notice.  You feed my desire for instant gratification. And I cannot continue life with you, not without a great price to go and find you again.  It has cost me dearly. But I can finally see.  Is there anything left of my soul to save?  Only God's grace can tell.

      Greetings all. I know. No one reads anymore because I haven't blogged. Well, something happened to my blog that I couldn't fix. So, I just picked a whole new template and I think it will solve my problem.  I am terrible with code. I don't know how to do it even when someone is right there explaining it to me. I had to just burn everything and start over because of the lovely comments in my guest book. Who ever those people are, they're B@$terds!  Anyway, many new things have happened. I have decided to go back to school with a double major in sports psychology and film making. No surprise to those who know me.  I have been avidly working out with Debi. She's a blogger too. I'd give you a link to her site, but I don't know how. I think she started a new one called "No Pain, No Charge." Which is also a shirt she gave me since I am training her.  I have hit a wall this week. I am tired, my knees hurt, my heals hurt, my hamstrings hurt, but I still go. I hired a trainer for once a month to give me some accountability. I am finally writing down what I do in a workout. Something I never did before. It was fun. One thing that is done is a strength test. Basically they test you to see how much you can bench press one time and how much you can leg press one time. Well, and, I do mean to brag. That's right, I do mean to brag...I benched 120 and leg pressed 690. If I had known that I was 10 pounds away from 700 I would have done 700. Be afraid, be very afraid.  I am going through a lot of change, pain, happiness, and answers to so many things. I can see there is so much to do, but only so much energy and time to do them. So, God has been teaching me to segment the things that need to be done and not get all stressed about doing everything in one day. I can rest in that.  So, all this to say, me and the dogs are doing great. I am glad  you gave me another chance and came to read my blog even though I am not good at being online much these days. Maybe having this back will change all that and I will be reading all of my friend's blogs again real soon.  A 40 to my homeys in Cali, and to my peeps in the BGS...peace.

      Well, long time no blog. Thanks for stopping by again.  I have gotten lazy. I don't like going online except at work with our dsl or what ever high speed connection we have. I have 15 minutes before I have to start. I have found that dial up service is just not cutting it for me. So I rarely go online. Terrible huh?  Well, Sunday a bunch of us went canoing down the Elkhorn River. It was 63 degrees. The water temp was 64. It was my first time canoing and it was a lot of fun. Keep in mind, I can't swim, so, it was a lot of fun. No one much cared for my constant rendition of dueling banjos. But I couldn't help but think of that movie Deliverance as we were going through some of the beautiful Kentucky scenery.  Our canoe got stuck on the rocks and rapids once. We successfully navigated "the claw" where 95 percent of canoes and kayaks flip over. All in all, considering I didn't have sense enough to bring a change of clothes, I did quite well staying dry. Only my shoes really got wet.  We had a quick change to our weather here. We went from hot 70 and 80 degree weather to 60s and 40s and this week dipping into the 30s. We went from summer to winter. I don't think it will stay this way though.  Well, I had better get to work here at the world trade center. That's right, the building I work in is called the world trade center. I'm on the 10th floor. But It doesn't freak me out. The window washers outside scare me when I don't expect them, but that's about it. Their job looks fun, repelling down the side of the building, squeegeeing as they go. But I wouldn't want to do that in winter.  Thanks for stopping by today and remember, smile-and everyone will wonder what you are up to!

      Greetings my faithful blog readers.  I am blogging to you from North Carolina, somewhere outside of Charlotte. Don't ask me where exactly, I have never been here before.  Even at night, this new state seemed lovely as we passed through the fog socked Smoky Mountains...huh...guess maybe that's how they got their name...anyway. At least, I think they were the Smoky Mountains.  With each new rise and valley a new sense of history and just connection followed me. It always happens when I meet with places of old. Old to me. Old to our country. The thought hit me, someone thought this was a good place to live without heat, water or electricity. It was staggering to behold.  I had all of 4 hours of sleep this morning as we pulled into MJ's friend, Karen's house, at 2 am. It's was full of us girls and after tonights conference it holds promise of laughter, games and talks of God and our lives following after Jesus. I know that may sound trite or quaint to some of my readers, but such is my life now. I am just too old to keep up with my old way of life. I'm tired and I need a new direction.  Mickey (our hostesses cat) was my alarm, and I do mean Alarm, clock this morning. Next thing I know I am being kneaded by Mickey on the head and it nearly made me shriek in my punchy sleep deprived state. I had to be weary of my neighbor close by on the sofa so I thought better of it.  And now, as I await the shower, and the others are gone except MJ; I thought now would be a good time to blog, since going back to bed is out of the question. We'll be getting up to go soon. I hope that God speaks to me today at this conference. And I hope I am alert enough to hear Him. Surely they have some form of coffee outfit in NC to make up for my lack of sleep.   To think a week ago I was in San Diego. If I were near the NC coast I could have seen the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans in a week. Oh well.  To my Cali friends. Very sorry for not visiting this last trip. I had a sense of urgency to visit solely with my family--considering the brevity of my stay. But I do plan to make up for it on my Christmas trip if possible. Meaning, if I make it out this year.  Love to all, and thanks for reading.  Peace

      Hello my friends. Thank you for stopping by my blog today.  As some of you may have read, I have had quite the traveling season. But it's good to be back in Kentucky. I have discovered that I need my routine, while I may get bored quickly with it, I need it.  I finally got back to the gym. Yesterday I had my monthly session with my trainer Whitney. She's a 24-year-old ex-cop from Atlanta. She really kicks my...well you get the picture.   I chose her because she reminds me of me when I used to train people, and frankly, I need that right now. If I have someone depending on me (Debi--she has devoted an entire blogsite to our workouts together called No Pain, No Charge...I'll have to get back to you all with the link if you are interested) I need someone holding me accountable and pulling me up to the next level so I can help Debi do the same.   I don't see having a trainer as a luxury expense, I see it as my only form of affordable health insurance. No insurance company will touch me because I have bi-polar disorder. (Unless I get a "real job" with benefits) So, I have to maintain my own health and do everything I can to stay that way. That is how I view working out. It's the only thing I can control in my otherwise, seemingly, out of control life right now.  I hate having bi-polar disorder. But at least it helps me to understand my highs and lows and not beat myself up for having the lows. Having an explanation doesn't change things, but it helps me to tolerate it a little better. But like I told my friend MJ when discussing pain and grief, understanding the damage of a gunshot wound doesn't take away the pain it causes. It only helps you to know why you hurt.   Thank God that He has gifted me with written word so I can express myself in these times. I don't always turn to it like I could, sometimes I do stupid things in my pain. But we all do.  So, I am going to share one of my latest poems. It sounds a bit like the Rachel of old some of you may remember, but nothing could be further from the truth. Frankly, it's me and God finally dealing with unfinished business from long ago. And I am thankful to be able to express these things to Him. Yes, it's about pain, but that is the season I have been going in and out of lately.  Untitled (13 Oct 03) by Rachel Kochackis  I can run Until acid runs through my veins  I can scream Until my voice doesn't sound the same  I can bleed Like the sky crying out with rain  But my outside Will never match my inner pain  GOD Now can you see me?  Will these wounds Make You come to my aid?  If I bang on my skull a little harder Will it awaken You Who dwells within?  I am spiritually anemic I can see all my gashes within  Bleeding my faith dry Yet I have no one to cling to But You  Now pain is what reminds me I'm living Warm, burning, throbbing reality  And I long to know Your peace again Then sleep the sleep of the sane  --end--  OK, don't freak. I'm not going to go jump off a bridge. Just coming to terms with the "inner demons" that should have been dealt with years ago. God, in His wisdom, knew that this was the season for such a thing--and no sooner. Here I have a lot of support and people to help me sort this out. And for that I am grateful. But between you, me, my PC and anyone in the WWW public who has stumbled upon this blog, I'd rather not do this at all. But such is the path that has been determined for me.  Wow. I haven't had this much to say in a long time. I hope I didn't bore you. And I hope you keep coming back to my blog and that you get something for yourself to take from it. (except making millions off my poems... :oP )  May you find your way today.  Peace.

      Hello Blogsters!  Greetings from the Lexington World Trade Center.  I don't know if my last post, posted, but I have been very sick. I am writing from work. I have a few minutes before I have to start.  Man, I don't like being sick. I just made it back to work yesterday for the first time in a week. I still feel like I have an ice pick in my lung, but at least my temp. is back to normal and I can eat again.  Been watching all the fire stuff. Funny how I can get homesick and then hear about all the fires. Strange timing. I have been angry that I can't afford to live in CA. And I can't say I'll be too sad about the new houses in Eastern Chula Vista being burned. I will feel bad for the people, but I never liked all that development going on. I wish that they would make a CA law saying you have to have been born in CA to buy property there. Boy, that would drive the cost down. Not.  Well, it is neither here nor there. I am where I am. And for now, it is where I belong. I'm just grumpy still from being sick. :o)  Thanks for reading my rantings.  Prayers are with all in So Cal  Peace

      Hello everybody  I meant to tell you all about something that was Halloween related. So this is a bit late but a little funny.  Out here we have Superamerica, which to my friends on the left coast that's kind of like a 7-11. And during the Halloween season, they had a promotional hot dog, "The Scary Dog". I don't know about the rest of you, but any convenience food like a hot dog you buy at a store like this, is scary anytime of year. So this was a bad promo idea, in my opinion. It was just a hot dog called a scary dog. Oooo Scary!  A bunch of friends and I made popcorn balls on Halloween. That was a first. I got so sick from all the candy and carmel. This was not a first. My first Easter here, I got sick on Easter candy.  I am trying to do talk to my mom and type at the same time. I am not a multi-tasker so this is a challenge. Women are supposed to be good at this, but apparently I am not.  I am still getting over my cold. It ruined my new Halloween tradition of donating blood on Halloween. I can't give blood until I get better.  Well, I am going to finish my conversation with mom.  Thanks for reading.  Peace.

      Greetings to all!  I finally did it. I found a high speed internet connection. I am going broadband now BABY!! Soon I will wonder how I ever existed with out this wonderful invention.  Perhaps now you will get more blogs from this tired old brain.  I spent the whole day installing, debuging and updating this old PC and it runs as good as my Jeep now...a-hem  Soon all of you will get my email notification to change my email in your little address books.  Well....that's it for now. I will tell you about the camping trip into snowman's land that I am going on this weekend. If I could, I provide streaming video. Someday...someday.   Ciao

      So I got my first moving violation ticket in Kentucky last night. I was guilty as sin, I wasn't going to fight that, but, that light at Alumni and Man o War, when you are turning left to go toward New Circle, I have been stuck thru 4 cycles of the lights and that left turn light won't change.  Last night, I was first in line to turn. The lights went through their cycle and before the through green lights changed to yellow I decided I would not sit through all those cycles again like the last time I was at that light. I'm going. Stupid me, there was a cop right behind me. I got busted. And the thing that ticks me off most is that even if I go to traffic school, I still have to pay a fine that is almost as much as if I pay the fine and don't go to traffic school.  When I got the ticket in my hand and the officer was fishing around to hear that I "learned my lesson." I told him I did. I have gone almost 10 years without a ticket, 4 years here in KY. And I credit that to watching for cops like a hawk. And next time in a similar situation, I will not lose my patience and make sure there aren't any cops around before I run that left turn light again. Thank you officer and Good Night. The nerve! :o)

      OK. I rarely say very negative things about the fine Commonwealth of Kentucky. But it SUCKS living here when it comes to finding DSL/Cable options for online services. I finally, finally decided that I had enough with AOL as my ISP. I was stuck on my email address, I didn't want to change it, but then I thought, look at what I am getting for my money. I can get a much better service for just a bit more. In fact, Verizon DSL is just a little more than what I am paying for dial up. Well, that's all well and good, but IT'S NOT AVAILABLE IN MY AREA. Bastards. None of the cable or DSL or decent high speed services are available to me. I can get Insight Communications as my ISP but I think it's like 60 bucks. This sucks, this sucks, this sucks. $#%#!@ It all. Thank you.

      I haven't blogged much lately, but I have more than a few things to say, but little time to say them.   For now, let me be the first to break the news, if you haven't heard already. Louisville is getting a Hard Rock Cafe. (As well as a 70 million dollar, really cool sounding entertainment complex called Fourth Street Live.) It will have, in addition to the Hard Rock, Borders Books & Music, Red Star Tavern, and hopefully some really cool clubs too!   Besides an enema, Lexington needs this type of investment downtown too. But what can I say about a town that just barely is getting its first Krispy Kreme and everyone is so stoked over that.  I guess I'll be hitting the Ville more often come next spring.  That's all I have to say today.

      I have been quite sad lately. I can't give you all the reasons...for reasons that...well...some of you will already know and for those who don't...well...I'm sorry I can't say. :oP  I am very sad because someone in my life it seems will be giving up soon. And there isn't anything I can do about it. I can only watch. I can of course pray, but you never know the outcome of such things anyway. I am hoping there is a change of heart and this person does not give up.  Since the moment I first heard the news, my heart has been downcast. A strange reaction, and one that I haven't been able to recover from. I find myself hearing solutions in everything from CNN to Comedy Channel movies. But there is nothing I can do. Even if I came up with the most elegant piece of arguement known to man. It is still in the hands of free will. And so, I share my saddness with you, my blogging audience.  Pray for this person if you will. God knows who I am talking about and what I am talking about. You don't need to.  Maybe tonight, I can rest and let God have this situation.  I thank you again for reading.  Peace.

      So today, I thought it would be in my blog audience best interest that I don't listen to Radio@AOL. Maybe I can actually have something to say if I am not headbanging to I wanna Be Sedated by the Ramones.  I have been through the valley highs and the mountain lows in as little as one week. And I have done some pretty stupid things in the process. One that I am actually willing to admit publicly is I went off my meds. Bad Rachel. Bad! But I have gained some new insights.  From my Journal Entry December 10, 2003 I feel like Louis in An Interview with a Vampire. I hate the creation I have become. I hate how I have to feed since my first taste of the flesh...I am living on the rats of the cyber world rather than prowl the night in search of new, fresh victims. Louis was a Vampire with human emotion and everyone loved him for it except himself. He was a tormented creature who felt hunger like no other. He hated killing yet had to, to survive, to feed. So is the Christian with an addiction or sexual/relational struggle. The hunger never goes away. And God never promises to take it. The best I can hope for is to learn to live with it. And right now that sounds like a dismal future. But I also know that there is never satisfaction for the hunger. Like the body, you eat and later you are hungry again. The hunger never goes away forever. You must learn to maintain the balance of feeding to live and saturating your body with food for pleasure...Yet, in spite of all this truth, I feel like Bruce the Shark. “Fish are our friends!” While my stomach growls in protest. I feel like Louis as I see the protruding veins of my next delicious victim. I can hear my heart race, feel my blood starved lips as I whisper whimpering No’s, pleading with my nature, do not do this evil thing.  Take up your cross and follow Me. Do we ever know what ours will be when we agree to that? Regardless of all that has occurred. Even though, by outward actions I may appear a failure. It must be God alive in me and His grace, that I have not given in and taken a bite from the forbidden fruits; that surround me daily. Whether I feel it or believe it. The evidence is overwhelming. The fact is, I have not acted according to my nature. There is no denying that.  --end--  WOW...Here's an oldie but a goodie. Man, have I made any progress in this desert? Or am I still going in circles?  December 8, 2002 Lexington, KY  I know now why God has always drawn me to Ecclesiastes, and Solomon. I can relate. Even from an early age that book made sense to me.   I am living through meaningless. All is meaningless. I eat and perhaps momentarily enjoy the flavor and it is expelled from my body. I can watch a new movie, and be inspired or moved, and the experience is over never to be duplicated again. I can read a book, gain insight and still need more. I can listen to songs that express my soul and still not feel heard. And I can have sexual experiences and still be left wanting, unsatisfied.  Jesus. Jesus is the magical elixir to all that ails me. If I abide in Him I will be full. I will have satisfaction, worth, perhaps at times joy. I don’t know how to take You in Jesus. It’s as I have said before. I recognize I have an emptiness, like a sharp hunger. But it’s not the same as feeding my stomach through my mouth. Where is my spiritual mouth? I read the Bible. I read books about people who have experienced You. I know I have had my own experiences, and yet I find myself staring at the cracks in my wall contemplating what will take away my emptiness after having read much about prayer and being desperate and hungry for You. Perhaps I haven’t yet realized my true hunger for You. My true thirst. But, I think about things like, if I were in jail I’d never have to worry about being alone again. I’d never have to worry about bills, or anything. But I couldn’t do what it would require to put and keep me in jail. I couldn’t live with my conscience. And I’m sure jail doesn’t hold the kind of people I’d really like to keep company with. But who knows, when you’re lonely and desperate, anything sounds good I guess.  So, I read about how important prayer is and how it is a gauge of the health of a church. The prayer night. That if we don’t ask God, we don’t receive. Maybe I don’t have, because I don’t know what to ask, or how to ask. I am a child of consumer America. A patriot through and through. I cut my teen teeth on the infancy of MTV only to find now I am no longer their welcome target audience. I’m too old.  I feel betrayed. They’re pushing VH1 on me. I am still very connected with the music of the day, for better or worse. Music helps me to abide, and perhaps it distracts me from Christ and puts my focus on things, problems, self. My passions are a gift and curse. My strength and my weakness. Music speaks to me, but too often I am hearing the wrong message. It’s because of my appetite for music of destruction. I don’t care as much for Christian music in a similar genre. To quote Bart Simpson, “All the best Rock bands are associated with satan.” I laughed at his statement, but I also grew up with Styper as the only alternative to secular music so parts of me are still jaded toward Christian Rock Bands. Even POD stripped themselves of their “Christian Rock Band” status and went secular along with MxPx and a little known group called U2.  All this to say, I still don’t have an answer. I still don’t have my “entertainment” for the evening to keep my mind off the numbing loneliness I face on nights like this. I think of many things. If you could have anything you want scenarios. It’s sad when I come to the end of each of them, knowing I’ll feel just as crappy but now with a guilty conscience. Well, maybe not with all the scenarios. And getting married doesn’t look like the end all be all to the problem. If anything, it seems to complicate everything. I’d rather be alone in God’s will, than married outside of it.  I don’t know what else to say. Just being honest with my feelings. Thanks for listening.  “It’s not having what you want. It’s wanting what you’ve got.” -– SPF 45 Sheyrl Crow  --end--  I hope someone got something out of all that.  Peace.

      Whut up?  I am listening to classic Sublime (Smoke 2 Joints) on AOLs Radio@AOL. They are trying to keep me. Gave me 2 free months to check them out broadband. But I'm still dumping them Feb 04. It's over between us. I hate it when you know a relationship is over but the other party doesn't get it and tries to hang on. Nothing to do but use them.  Got back from holiday with my friends down @ Cumberland Lake. It didn't snow like I expected. Jammed out with my Soul Sista MJ and Sally to some old school dance and hip hop on a Mtv Dance Party to Go cd. Remember those...CDs :o) LOL Got some good video.  Cool... Jugheads Revenge is on...Just Start Shooting on Mod Punk. I have to say, I am enjoying all the music at my disposal. Just about every kind I can think of. Just heard Peter and the Test Tube Babies (Banned from the Pubs) Man...you can't make this stuff up. I love the names of punk bands. And the classic punk station really takes me back. So does the 80s Alternative station...who doesn't love the Replacements? If you are a King of the Hill fan...guess who does the music...and I think they do Malcolm in the Middle too (You're Not the Boss of Me Now...no wait...that's They Might Be Giants...sorry) Hey...Danny Elfman does the Simpsons and that says it all. Alright...Suzy is a Headbanger by the Ramones is on...(headbanging...) Punk is not good blogging music...I'm ready to slamdance with Mike and Vic. (HeAdBaNgiNg again...)  So...I am too distracted to blog right now. And my homey the infamous B.I.L.L. is IMing me right now.  Peace

      Greetings from the Frozen Lexington land  Soon, I will be free to experience the exotic climate of Chula Vista, CA at a balmy 60+ degrees! Ok maybe it might hit 68.  I know, some of my posts have been a little on the dark side. No really, they have. And I am going up and down on my moods like a duncan yo-yo, but for now I am feeling good and I am not going to question it. I am just going to go with it.  I always get really weird before my trips home. Sleepless nights. Just sure I am going to forget something. But one thing I know for certain. I will miss all my friends here in Kentucky while I am gone.  There is a lot to be said about community. And to single people like myself, if you have friends like I do, who are a lot like family, you are blessed. It is always a bittersweet feeling to visit those I love in California and leave those I love here behind. Inspite of all my whinning, I am blessed. I have so many people who love me. And many do not. I will not take this for granted.  In poverty or wealth, nothing can compare to having loved ones. I can't think of anything more upsetting than to possess all the worlds wealth and still be alone. Nothing can buy that hole in your heart. And it is because of the comrades in this battle of life, those who deny themselves and follow Christ, that I sense this; for lack of a more descriptive word, kinship.  This season, take time to do something for those you love. Especially if it is in secret.  Until next blog. Which I hope to write from Cali.  Have a great holiday with whom ever you share it with.  Love to all. And Peace.  Rachel

      A page from my Journal December 16, 2003  I know now, why, I seem so intent on charging the “edge” all the time. It is only when staring into the dark abyss of the unknown that I can see my true reflection.  This dark dreary night of the spiritual winter, with the haunting winds calling out my name, whispering soft warnings of what could be. The foretelling of downfalls, that are sometimes mistaken for the Siren songs of desire; they are so clear and beautiful. Then I hear the faint roar of humanity, crashing upon the shore. How can I not visit the ledge to see?  But it is more than I can withstand, the cries, the horror, and the pain; when I can’t even face that which is within. So I gash myself with the razors of society; such a hurried frenzy.  Slashing myself with anti-love; anti-music; anti-life; anti-joy; and anti-Christ; can I cleanse myself of my sin? Can it quiet the voices, the cries, the horrors and pain that haunts my presence? Dare I say and risk being blasphemous, the presence that draws the Creator of life near me? Will I forever stay away? This ever faithful Father to the fatherless; will I continue to sin and call what He has made holy, evil?  The Many of Me cry out. Who is the real I? Nothing—silence. Only the growing feeling, that I am ever weary of that which I can not have; lingering against my lips. Do I hear the heavenly hosts, proclaiming who is my Lord and pointing the way to salvation? No. Only the voices of a past I cannot change, and the fuzzy laughter in the future—is it mockery or joy?  My mind searches for answers, for reason, for action; and the dentist waiting room music plays while I wait:   "...help me, I broke apart my insides, help me, I’ve got no soul to sell help me, the only thing that works for me, help me, get away from myself…   You can have my isolation, You can have the hate that it brings You can have my absence of faith, You can have my everything help me, tear down my reason…help me, You make me perfect,  Help me become somebody else."  ( NIN  —Closer.)    "Wish I was too dead to cry—My self-affliction fades Stones to throw at my creator—Masochists to which I cater You don't need to bother; I don't need to be—I'll keep slipping farther But once I hold on, I won't let go 'til it bleeds  Wish I'd died instead of lived—A zombie hides my face Shell forgotten with its memories—Diaries left with cryptic entries And you don't need to bother; I don't need to be—I'll keep slipping farther But once I hold on: I'll never live down my deceit"   ( Stone Sour  —Bother )   "And with the early dawn—Moving right along I couldn't buy and eyeful of sleep—And in the aching night under satellites I was not received—Built with stolen parts A telephone in my heart—Someone get me a priest To put my mind to bed—This ringing in my head Is this a cure or is this a disease  Nail in my hand—From my creator You gave me life—Now show me how to live Now show me how to live…"  ( Audioslave  —Show Me How to Live )   "In Your house I long to be—Room by room patiently I'll wait for You there—Like a stone I'll wait for You there Alone  On my deathbed I will pray—To the gods and the angels Like a pagan—To anyone who will take me to heaven To a place I recall—I was there so long ago The sky was bruised—The wine was bled And there You led me on  And on I read—Until the day was gone And I sat in regret—Of all the things I've done For all that I've blessed—And all that I've wronged In dreams until my death—I will wonder on"  ( Audioslave  —Like a Stone )   Do you hear these things God? These songs cry out my heart to You? Does it matter where I got them from? Do they need to go through some cleansing purification to be in a prayer? Can I leave this spiritual wasteland? Will You free me from the Many of Me’s, who usurp the place You made? For the edge of the world calls to me, it beckons me, come in. If I jump, if I fall, will You still save me from myself?

      Greetings Blog friends  Thank you for stopping by again. Did you see my stupid.com wish list? I think I have successfully made a link for you below. Please visit and remember it is better to give than receive. :o)   urlLink Rachel's Stupid.com wishlist   I still haven't started my meds up. I need to though. I keep fighting depression with or with out them. (singing U2s song...I can't live...with or without you) Ahh so true, so true.  I am discovering that while I claim my faith as Christian. I do feel more and more like a Buddhist in living the first 2 truths of da buddha. Wait, no, not that buddha (talking about the 420 kind to those in the know, and to those who don't...you don't need to)  Wait, oh yes, the first 2 truths of the Buddha  1. Existence is suffering.   (Well...Duh! Does it really take enlightenment to know that?)   2. Suffering comes from desire.   (It sure does. And it sure SUCKS!)   Yes. I must really be enlightened because I do exist, I do suffer, and I am full of various desires.  "Fish are our friends!"   It seems  my Inner Bruce  (who, does coincidently speak with an accent, Australian, but not a lisp. :oP ) is alive and screaming for fulfillment. But, he can not have it. I guess that's the suffering that Buddha refers to. To the defense of my character,  "it's been 36 days since I have eaten a fish."  I do mean that literally. Don't email me asking me what that is code for. I mean I haven't had fish since...shoot. I mean since last Tuesday. I forgot about my Korean dining experience. Kim-Chee and lots of other yummy goodies. But I am off track again.  I am so stinking depressed, I don't even want to go see Return of the King at the midnight showing this evening. I have waited 3 years to wrap up this LOTR saga, and now...I could care. That's pretty depressed for me. But drugs are not the answer! R/X drugs, however, are quite fine. I think I'll take a handful of Klonipin and go to bed. (Just being highly sarcastic. I am not going to do this, because I need it all for my trip home!!)  I stayed in bed all day yesterday. I didn't get up until this morning when I forced myself into work. I was screaming "God HELP ME!" the entire time. I guess any prayer is good so long as it is sincere.  Well. Enough whinning. No wonder no one ever wants to read this thing. It's just me whinning all the time and I don't want to hear it either. Sheesh.  I hope I have something more edifying to say on my next post.  Thanks for stopping by.  Peace.

      It is day 6 of my captivity. But the worst seems to be over. The Holidays that is. Ohh...wait, better be careful...family reads this too...oh what a lovely time I am having. It's 55 degrees and raining! Just the perfect weather to fit my mood. Ok. It's not that bad.  I have been having a lot of good family time. But in good family time comes hard lessons sometimes.  Like doing things you don't want to do, that aren't bad or anything, it's just not your choice to do it, but doing it for someone you love. That's how my relationship with my dad is. I love him very much. But we don't have a relationship that is easy to explain. But maybe, what father and daughter do? But I went to go see him at his job. He is very proud of it. It's security in a highrise. Talks about it...all...the...time. In fact, it's almost all he talks about. So...of course I would want to see the place? Right? Not really. But I did anyway. Because it was important to my dad. And I love him. It has to be one of the most grown up decisions I have ever made.  God showed me something in that. Sometimes love is about doing what you don't want because you love. I should feel that way about God. But frankly, I really don't. I do good most of the time because I am supposed to. And in the big issues, I stay and suffer through obeidence because I am afraid of what may become of me if I do not. But I want to do it out of love. Like me and my dad. This is a new growth for me. In all the messiness in my life right now, it gives me hope to see I am still progressing somewhere.  Reporting live from "sunny" cali  peace

      Oh spectacular failure. If nothing else I hope I can be that. It will mean I kept trying until life crushed me under its heel.  I met a young man on the plane home today. A fellow Christian named Brad. He is finishing his training at Ft. Knox KY, then off to TX and then off to Iraq. We had a long talk about providence and God. He is going to be a calvary scout (kinda a pointer for the tanks) it's a dangerous job. We spoke of fear at war and such. I said fear is normal, that it is those time we must turn our lives over to God for protection.  I feel like a hypocrite. I am so mad with God right now. But frankly, I am like Neo in the Matrix. That scene where he is given the opportunity to get out of the car and Trinity tells him that he's been down that road and he knows where it goes (nowhere) and I always cry when I watch that part. That's how I feel. I have no where to go but forward. No matter how much I may try to back paddle, I have to go forward.  I am such a screw up. All the tests God gave me over the last 2 weeks I have failed. I know, get up and keep going. But frankly, I am growing weary of this journey. But I have no where else to go but forward. I fear for my future if I do not turn it over to God. Funny. Everytime I get on a plane, I place hand on the outside and ask God's protection. Today, they had to make us wait a half hour while they fixed something with our emergency slide. I don't know if that could have blown open in flight or something, but it made me glad that I pray every flight for the plane and the crew that takes care of us.  Talking to Brad, there was a little part of me that wonders and wishes that I would have pursued an Air Force Career. I admire our troops. I wish I were young enough and fit enough to be there too. Or maybe having your life threatened is a good way to keep your mind of the crap that needs to be dealt with.  I can't make up my mind. One minute I want to come back to KY and then I am here and I wish I were in SD. I guess the grass is always greener where the dogs a Sh#ting (to quote Soundgarden).  I just feel so lost right now. But I am trusting that it is in this place of helplessness that God is going to outshine me.  I am just rambling now. So I guess I will stop.   Thanks for reading.  A 40 to my homeys who are no longer with us  Peace

      I won't start with the usual  Happy New Year , we all know it is 2004. I hope all of yours have started out better than mine.  It is amazing how you can start out a day feeling wonderful and then have one event destroy it.  I have been having horrible mood swings. I have been F#@%ed over by the system and can't get the meds I need. It's sad that it is actually cheaper for me to get pot to bring me out of mania than it is to buy my depakote. But I haven't resorted to that. I can't in good conscience spend money on that. Considering my dad is supporting me.  He is too good to me. On top of paying my ticket and the endless medical bills, now he is bailing me out of my $209.00 deficit in my bank account. I feel like S#@t. I can't seem to handle my own finances very well. Maybe I need someone to manage it for me. I hate having this bipolar disorder and I hate that I feel like people might think it is my excuse for being a screw up.   God help me when my dad isn't around to bail me out anymore. I hurt more over the idea of the loss of my dad than his support. He loves me so much. I don't understand where love ends and dependence begins, but maybe I shouldn't worry about that. Maybe all of this is to show me that God loves me even more. Maybe this is God's tangible way to show my helplessness and my need for Him. I hope it sinks in. This is a painful lesson.  I hit a little mania this week. Enough that I sound like a tweeker. I look like one when I see my eyes, I look wired. Fortunately, I have had the meds to knock me out so I am not up 36 hours. It's interesting to see that when I am like this, and I drink, I feel kind of level...a little normal. I have had two nights this week that I have drank more than I usually do, and it mellowed me out. It didn't depress me. But definitely, I can't drink when I am pissed or upset. It would make it worse.  I spent New Years in a house in the hills (not the Hollywood Hills) but our south bay version of it, Mt. Helix. It's a place for people with money. I video taped it. Kristy, excuse me, Deputy Kristy Spratt, and I played Cops/Cribs/Room Raiders. It was fun. Her boyfriend was housesitting for some people and they said have people over, and eat and drink what ever you'd like. AwwwYeah. We had steaks, and Karl Straus Beer (that's a San Diego beer) and I of course found and opened the 2nd most expensive bottle of Champaign in the house. Moet. There's supposed to be those little two dots over the "e". It's a Champaign that costs anywhere from 30-60 dollars a bottle. There was another bottle (these people had like 30 bottles of wine, Champaign, and sparkling Champaign...not to mention every kind of liquor you could imagine including Mead! Anyway, the other expensive bottle, was around 40-60 a bottle. I had it before and I didn't like it. I prefer the Moet, it is my favorite Champaign. Unfortunately, no one else like Champaign, so I drank most of the bottle myself. And two beers and a highly caffeinated coffee drink with 2 shots of 151 and 3 shots of this pecan liquor. I dubbed it...Skittlebrau. It was tasty. Everyone liked it. I cut myself off after that and was drinking plenty of water. By the way, this all was before 10 pm. I still had two hours to go. But I didn't feel like a normal drunk. I felt impaired, but my mind was sharp. It was like the alcohol helped me direct the speed of my mind and use it at my discretion. It was really kind of odd. Then we all had sparkling wine at midnight, the cheaper stuff that Julie brought was really good. I can't remember the name, but I do remember you had to pop a cork not unscrew a cap so it was decent.  And so, with really two days left to go, and two friends left to see, I am looking forward to getting back home to Lexington.

      Day 9 in San Diego  It seems almost all I have feared would occur on my trip, has. If it were not for my compartmentalizing, I don't know how I could stomach my existence right now.  The "precious" has found me out here. It has been little comfort but to bring about swift sleep on restless nights. And there have been oh so many of them. Along with deep, unrelenting depressing. But in all fairness, I have also been suffering for Jesus in huge whirlpool bubble baths too.  I have been documenting my journey on video (except the whirlpool bubble baths), although I don't know what I will do with all this footage.  So I fancy myself a documentary film maker. And it is this belief that took me to a new level of temptation.  I found myself cheek to cheek with a fresh orchid, in a place I could hardly believe I was in. But as beat gave way to new lyric, I found myself speaking about film making and documentaries of people who would rather follow God and do what they may not choose to do or want to do, simply out of love for God. I shared about Joseph. I found myself speaking in such away, that I felt that my buddies there with me, brought me there, as if they were welcoming me back from war and trying to find me some R&R. I wanted some R&R. I'm tired of this war. But I also felt this sense of camaraderie with my c/o peeps, in that we are in this unique battle together.   But today, over coffee, I will breath deeply, the scent of this orchid, and specifically spell out my dream of  documentary making and its subject matter. Something this orchid is fascinated by, as well as the morality of being able to love whom you choose.   Knowing the breaches, knowing the game, will I leave this orchid untouched? I don't know. I grow wary of the cyber rats and the things of this world that I feed on and do not sustain me. Perhaps these are the very truths I will share that will help the orchid stay away from someone as dangerous and untouchable as me. This dark angel who was captivated me. Time will tell.  As for now, I'm going to start my drinking early, and have a cup of coffee. I will watch the steamy surface of this beverage with visions of Golium, smiling as he finally took hold of his precious and fell into the fiery pits of Mordor. I don't know my fate. But the Rachel where God dwells is so hard to hear now.  I am hearing about how I could find work here and start my old life again. But I know that is a false me speaking. The same false me that was one of the guys last night, trying to drink in all that the world could offer me.  I know this doesn't sound like progress. But as public as this is, I won't go into the details here. But the small part of me where Rachel is and God dwells keeps telling me, this is my path. I most only concern myself with moving forward, not falling. Even if I am setting up my own self-destruction.  Do not worry for me. I am living "the dream" I have several New Years parties, and one with a band at their studio, and I have the weather. I should be the happiest F#$@ken person in the world. Well...none of that means jack s#%t to me. Nothing is filling the growing emptiness inside me. Not even a fresh orchid can do that. But it still doesn't mean I don't want to find that out for myself.  Round and round she goes, level 1 or 2 or 0? I guess after today we'll see. Is there a level -1?  I know it's not cheery news. But if I have nothing else, not integrity or dignity, I can at least have my honesty.  ciao

      I have been reading a book called  Under the Banner of Heaven  by Jon Krakauer. It is a fascinating but sad account of two Fundamentalist Mormon brothers who murder their sister-in-law and 15 month old niece because one of them received a "Removal Revelation" from God, i.e. there were certain people who were in the way of God's will and must be "removed" from His way. It is a very interesting book because it jumps into the history of the Latter Day Saints Church or LDS church from the days of it's founder Joseph Smith, to pretty much the present. And according to their most "holy" publications (besides the  Bible ) they have one called  The Doctrine and Covenants  or  The D&C.  It is a publication that has been added to by the President, Prophet, and Seer (this is one man) of the LDS church from Joseph Smith to the present by divine revelation from God. These revelations are considered scripture on par with the  Bible  and of course  The Book of Mormon.   As Fundamentalist Mormons, these brothers believed that the LDS church had strayed from the true path as set by Joseph Smith, according to  The D&C , Section 132, regarding having "plural wives or celestial marriage" a.k.a. polygamy. Joseph Smith did in fact write a "revelation" regarding having "plural wives" and so in a way, maybe a warped way, they were right. But Section 132 of  The D&C  is not practiced by the LDS church because of the bad public reaction it received when made public to the "Gentiles" (anyone who was not a "Saint") and the LDS church as a whole, by Brigham Young on August 29, 1852. This was a revelation pretty much kept secret from the LDS church as a whole since Smith's revelation in 1843. His practice of polygamy was also kept on the down low and only his closest followers, mostly the 12 Apostles (Brigham Young being one of them and also a polygamist) knew of his practice, besides Smith's very understandably upset first wife Emma Smith. It is suggested that Section 132 of  The D&C  was written to appease Emma's disapproval and to keep her from going out and having more than one husband. (See, Section 132 only allows for plural wives, not husbands...humm...how convenient)  While I am sure, this book is like "Cliffs Notes" of the history of the LDS church it is important to the motive behind these tragic murders. Now, I don't recall if this is listed in  The D&C , but "Joseph Smith taught that certain grievous sins put sinners 'beyond the reach of the atoning blood of Christ' Their only hope {was} to have their own blood shed to atone'"  Under the Banner of Heaven , Page 204.  Now this is the mindset of these 2 brothers as they commit this murder. See, there are 5 of these brother total. And all of them begin to see the error of the LDS church and the need to practice Section 132 of  The D&C.  Well, all the other brothers were in agreement. But their youngest brother's wife, Brenda, was not only against it, she convinced one of the wives of the brothers to divorce him on these grounds. This was the brother who had the "Removal Revelation."  So this is just my summary, imagine the book! Anyway, in a weird sort of warped way, in following with the teachings of Joseph Smith, these brothers were acting out a righteous deed. It's sad, but they really believed they were doing God's will. Oh, by the way, Steve Young, former quarterback for Brigham Young University and the MVP QB of the San Francisco 49'ers, he's the great-great-great grandson of Brigham Young. Interesting little bit of trivia.  Now the timing of the second book I am reading is interesting. I have also started reading  Celebration of Discipline  by Richard J. Foster. This is a Christian classic. The book speaks of these long practiced but nearly forgotten disciplines of the early Christian church, such as meditation, prayer, fasting, studying, (these are referred to as Inward Disciplines) simplicity, solitude, submission, service, (these are referred to as Outward Disciplines) confession, worship, guidance, and celebration (and these final ones are referred to as Corporate Disciplines).  See, on my current journey, the idea that the inner changes that occur and need to occur are God's work, not our own, is not a new idea. Only God can work from the inside of us. "We cannot attain or earn this righteousness of the kingdom of God; it is a grace that is given." ( Celebration of Discipline , page 6)   Paul says all through the book of Romans "that righteousness is unattained and unattainable through human effort." ( Celebration of Discipline , page 6) See Romans 5:17.  I have heard this. I have digested it. I have contemplated the meaning of it. And in a way falsely came to the conclusion that there was nothing I can do. That I must wait for God to come and transform me. While it is true, human striving isn't going to cut it and righteousness and true inner change is a gift from God, there is something I can do. These Disciplines. Now the best way I can describe what I have learned is to think of God as a wave, and The Disciplines as like a surfboard (must be the native Californian in me). Basically, The Disciplines are tools that put us in the way of God's will for our lives. Hence my analogy. They put me where God can work within me and transform me. But, by themselves, these Disciplines do nothing but can put me somewhere that change can happen. The book calls it "'the path of disciplined grace.' It is 'grace' because it is free; it is 'disciplined' because there is something for us to do"  Keeping this in mind, it is important not to let these Disciplines become like the law. The book puts it well when saying, "Such a deterioration of the Spiritual Disciplines results in pride and fear. Pride takes over because we come to believe that we are the right kind of people. Fear takes over because we dread losing control."  So how do I figure this ties into the other book I am reading? To once again quote from the book, "When we genuinely believe that inner transformation is God's work and not ours, we can put to rest our passion to set others straight." Get it, straight...ha ha. This quote not only brings to mind the fateful deeds of the aforementioned Fundamentalist Mormon brothers, but also brings to mind a former reader whom shall remain nameless. But, hey, what do I know. I could be wrong.  And I hear the cyber sigh of relief that I have stopped @#$%#% and moaning about my life and posted something a bit more uplifting.  May the peace of our Lord Jesus the Christ be with you today.  Later.

      It is so peacefully quiet as the night snow falls softly on Lexington. It brought me to the following thoughts.  In my journey to self-definition I have discovered one thing.   I am nothing without God.   Perhaps I am a generous fool Too trusting and idealistic For the paradox known as mankind.   So be it.   Why be remembered For my rotting gallery Of dead presidents?  The matrix is this: I do not possess what possesses me. Nothing tangible ever lasts.  What profit is there In clinging to a world Of eventual death?  True freedom and identity lie In releasing what I know.   And embracing the impossible   For only then can I see The end of myself  And the beginning of God.   --------------------------------------------------------------- If you know the tune These are my words to  Overcome  by Live  The devil's in the streets My soul he seeks to tear My Savior's in my heart Giving light when I'm unaware This life You've given me Is sometimes too much to bear  But I will overcome I will overcome through Jesus Your Holy Spirit in my lungs So I will overcome  This desert trail is long The sun is in my face Been walking many years But I can't keep up this pace So I'm reaching out my hand And trusting in Your grace.  But I will overcome I will overcome through Jesus Your Holy Spirit in my lungs And I will overcome  I'm laying down my life But I'm scared to give it all I told You this before So what happens if I fall? Forgive me for my doubts But my sin's begun to call.  But I can overcome I can overcome through Jesus Your Holy Spirit in my lungs I can overcome  I'm walking down this beach Waves sizzling from the foam So many miles I've come So many more to roam I long to be with You And finally I'll be home.  For I'll have overcome I'll have overcome through Jesus Your Holy Spirit in my lungs I'll have overcome  I'll have overcome  ---------------  Peace to you in our Lord Jesus Christ

      Bloggety blogger...blog blog blog blog :o)  OK happy thoughts, happy thoughts...yesterday the Krispy Kreme empire opened a new fort down the road from me. And there was great rejoicing in Lexington.  And now, previously, on my blog. As you all read, there is a former reader who stopped reading because of my potty type. Well...I have dear friends who responded, and here we go:   Rachel  What the h#$* are u talkin about!!!! : )  Kidding of course. I'll keep reading.....it is the best insight for me to see how you're doing without asking you personally. : )  But in regards to that person....I kind of understand how she was offended. For me, it was kind of a shock to see that kind of wording...even censored. I mean, yes, it gets the point across, but you know there is Steven Speilberg and then there is Martin Scorsese. Both get their points across.......but one is a little more graphic than the other. Know whut I mean.  Personally, I see both sides to it. I know you, so I hear your voice and I see the censor marks and it makes me laugh. But then I see the side from the person that cares about you and I see what seems like a pissed off girl who used to write pretty clean stuff on her blog.....and now she seems to think that she cannot express herself unless she is cursing. You seem angry. (No Duh! huh???)  I mean, if suddenly I said in an email to you, what the f#@! are you doing. It would kind of surprise you wouldn't it???  (No, not really)  ALso, I think you should take it as kind of a compliment. Because truth be told, the Rachel that I know and the Rachel that this reader knows....does not normally use this language. Doesn't mean you don't ever.......it just means that you don't NORMALLY write with it. Look back on your blogs....and tell me if I am wrong...  OK, I have given waaaay to much time to that subject...  I felt like crap reading your blog and seeing how you were struggling with stuff here in SD and it seems you never once thought to call me  (I did try to call but we only connected once...that's cool though...I know you're there for me always) and talk about this stuff. I am your support group Rachel!!!!! Especially here in SD...  Anyway, I hope you understand where i am coming from.......becuz I really want to understand where you are and what you are going through. You may feel that God is a long ways away from you, but if you look a little closer, you will see that the support group God gave you, is still alive and well...   (To this dear reader I say thank you. You will always be a lifelong friend. I love you and I know I ALWAYS have your support no matter how long we may go with out actually talking to each other. I know you got my back bro.)   And from another reader:    Yo Rachel   as for the potty type crap...ie....   "I won't be reading your blogspot anymore, I don't care to read dirty words. I pray you get your life cleaned up. Let me know if I can help you get right with God and get your health improved. Blessings "    They think this blog is dirty ...they'd love mine.... They are praying you get your life cleaned up and offered to help you clean up and get healthy....   Jeez.....how white of them.    I guess these people never read books, watch tv, have cable, watch movies or venture ever into the outside world.     Welcome to being in God's will where it isnt all warm and fuzzy all the time. Where things get frustrating, difficult, intense, and extreme. This is not Leave it to Beaver, the Brady Bunch, nor the Waltons   God's will is not "Politically Correct" God's will is not based on what you, nor the church, think God's will is not confined to the limits of our understanding    but heres a little bit of what i do know:   Being in God's will, you will always have some form of conflict, some are bigger and harder than others. Being in God's will isnt always pretty, with sugar on top. Sometimes its a perverbial war zone.    when you're in Gods will theres ususally some sort of conflict/ trial/ tribulation/ whatever, going on in your life causing you to grow and make you stronger and better.    If you are walking "in Gods will" and there is nothing going on..... to the extent that you can look at your neighbor and critque their lives and how they are going about things...and their walk with Christ.... then perhaps you need to stop and take off the glasses darkly, and look around and see where you TRULY are walking.    Especially if you've been walking along with God for a looong time... because people get in to their comfy little ruts, and get complacent...and its soooo easy to see the speck in someone elses eyes....vs the log in your own.    im sure the rest of us appreciate your candidness.... and truthfull ness.... ill admit that i get frustrated and swear when im talking to God.... anyone whom cant be that real with God and that honest and truthful with their creator, must not have a very good relationship with Him. That would be like having a wife/husband that you dont burp or fart around because they'll get offended.    My grandparents have been married for 23 years and do all that. (and they are christians) Because they are real and realistic with each other..... dont you think God wants the same from us? Like God doesnt see thru the "sunday-go-to-meetin- clothes....and the "gosh-darn-its"....and know that we are imperfect and not infalliable. That sometimes that an extreme word is the only way to express that feeling. I mean duh people....."i was so angry".....vs..... "i was so F#ckin pissed"...... which do you think is the more extreme emotion?    so whom ever this guy/chick is....they need to friggin relax... they're just words.... like i said....if they think you got potty type .... they outta read my blog. lol     (This readers blog is:  urlLink http://www.archangel007.blogspot.com / If you're interested.)   (And to this dear reader I say thank you as well. I appreciate our discussions and that you always challenge me in my walk with God. That we don't always see eye-to-eye but we remain good friends. For a long time I hope. But, cut my former reader some slack. Some people are truly offended by swearing, and being one in the same faith I am willing to have sensitivity to that. I just wanted to know what you other 5 readers thought about the subject. :o) )  Anyone else got something to say. Mail it. :oP  Chillin' for now...wit da Fugees and Nelly  Peace

      The big news today, besides that I have potty type is that the long awaited Krispy Kreme Donuts opens a mere 5 minutes from me. I am doing my best to avoid the temptation and limit myself to perhaps sundays before church.  Nothing else really happening except what has already been said.  later

      I received the following email today:   "I won't be reading your blogspot anymore, I don't care to read dirty words. I pray you get your life cleaned up. Let me know if I can help you get right with God and get your health improved. Blessings (name withheld)"   I guess I have a problem with potty type and well, frankly I didn't know this person even read my blog or that I have been offensive to anyone.   This blog is where I express my real feelings. And sometimes S#@t happens, things get F#@%ed up, and life can be a B#@ch. And I say so on here, to a certain extent. I do try to clean it up a bit, and I do not mean to say that I swear all the time and it's ok to cuss like a sailor. But when I talk to God, sometimes I swear. Sometimes there is no other way for me to express my pain or feelings but to call what ever it is to me, what it is...a swear word. They say that it is a sign of a lazy mind, but I disagree. To me it is the most extreme way to express something. And sometimes I have extreme things to express.  It's sad though. Just out of the blue, it feels as though this person has cut me out of their life because they have read about my honest struggles I am having in my life and because of the way I choose to express them. And suddenly, I am not right with God and this person can help me get there. That I need to clean up my life, H-E double hockey sticks, that is a life long process. I am just now learning that. Change is not an instant thing. It is a progression. And maybe, to this person, it appears I have not progressed. I can understand that. When this person met me, I was in the typical honeymoon phase that many of us on this journey have. Now, reality has hit. The pain is coming up. And I am being real about it on here. And it is sad that this person, who said they care about me and wants to pray about things in my life, can not allow me grace enough to "swear" (as it were) or give me an email asking me to tone it down. I can say _______ instead of s#@t. Or (censored). But I had no idea that what I have been writing, pouring my heart out on here was bothering anyone. And to just email me saying they won't be reading anymore over that, well, their loss. I guess that just cut my readership in half.  So the following was my response to this email:   "I'm sorry I offended you. Sometimes the only way to express something is to say it. But I do censor it to try not to offend.  As for "cleaning up my life" that will be a life long process. Yes, I am having a hard time, and my blog is where I express myself. Frankly, I didn't know anyone was reading it except for maybe 3 people. I won't stop being real. So I guess it's best you not read it. Even thought it is the best way to know what is happening in my life. I am having a very difficult time right now and I am sorry that my expression of this pain offended you. But I am no farther away from God for it. But you can pray for me anyway if you feel so inclined.  Thanks for caring."   Anyone else offended by my blog? #$%@ you....just kidding. Seriously, let me know. I can try to tone it down. At least maybe I will get email responses. :o)  Thanks for reading (whoever you are)  Peace

      Greetings all.  Sorry for the huge delay in my entries. I seem to be recycling the same bad habits. But on a happier note, I have been approved for disability and I am receiving payments retroactively from Aug. of last year. Needless to say, this will be a significant check that has dwarfed my enthusiasm over my tax return refund.  I am so relieved. I will meet with my Voc. Rehab. Counselor on Friday and discuss the possibility of returning to school. Now, what do I want to do when I grow up?  I have also received a revelation on where my hope and value lie. I have heard it and heard it and heard it, but finally it sunk into my heart and I understood that my value is in the fact that God sent Jesus to die for me and my hope is in the fact that the same resurrection power that rose Jesus from the dead resides in me. And that is the power that will be effecting true change and healing in my life. And I can see each temptation for what they are as they come. An attack against the truth of where my value and hope lie. It's been powerful.  Today is the big game. I notice no one seems to be calling the NFL Championship game by the well known name. I think CBS must have demanded big money for permission to use the name or something. Everyone is calling it the big game, etc. and so for except CBS. But I am sure only I have noticed this. I am weird like that.  That's all I really have to say. Nothing really profound or out there. Ummm...my pipes froze in my house again. Finally got that taken care of. Ummm...I think that's it.  Peace  Rachel

      Greetings to all on this lovely Friday the 13th!  I am writing to you from the lovely World Trade Center in beautiful downtown Lexington, KY!  I am waiting on the copier as I am on a deadline to turn in 5000 flyers for my boss who is out of town and forgot to tell me about the deadline, which was today. Why is it I am always working with people who have me doing these things last minute.  He told me not to worry about it but, he's been so good to me, it's the least I can do.  I have to not only get these things copied, but I need to go to Kinko's and have them cut. They are 3 up on a page. I know, exciting stuff!  Tomorrow is the best day of all!! Valentines day! Wooop Eee. No, I am sure it's cool for all those in love couples and marrieds out there. But to me, it's no big deal. Now, if I were in a relationship, I might feel differently. But I don't need a special day to remind me whether or not I am in love.  It's been a year since I started blogging and a year since the ice storm, and a year since my tasteful comentary on the valentine's day massacre.  So much has happened. I am in pain. Good pain. The working out kind of pain that I love so much. Whitney kicked my !@#$. LOL Had to say it like that. Just for the heck of it. :o) I have appointments to see her next week and already my eating has dramatically improved. And this has followed into other areas of my life like my househould duties and such. I am a real slob. But I have been learning the value of cleaning as I go instead of waiting until I can't stand it. Kinda like the situation I put myself in right now with my physical health. I need to learn to stay fit as I go through life instead of waiting until I can't stand how I am living anymore.  Well, I think it's time to make more copies.  More later.  peace

      Hello all!  I know, long time, no blog. Sorry about that. I hit that lovely, I don't want to anything except what I have to do cycle. Now I'm out of that. Hoping to stay out of that.  Now with this new decision about my disability, and discussing things with my voc rehab counselor, I decided I really want to focus on my health. I am turning my life over to that crazy trainer Whitney who, for the last 3 sessions, almost made me throw up. Now, that's good training! I have the time and the money and now I am ready for things to change. I have been once again, living the definition of insanity, which is doing the same things and expecting a different outcome. Never happens, take my word for it. For change to happen, I must change as well.  I want to be ready for that run in August and I will not make it at the rate I am going. But, if I am working with Whitney, I am more motivated to do what needs to be done. It took the accountability of a trainer once for me to make significant changes in my life style, I can't see why I wouldn't need one again for now. I am actually excited about this. I can see myself succeeding, just because my attitude is that I will get healthy or die trying. The thing is, I am trying. I have a thing about failure. I don't like failing. Who does? But I will take it to the extreme of not trying so I won't fail. I can't live like that any more. I am not happy living like this and I used to have a better attitude. I believe I can get it back.  So, that is the latest.  Until next blog.  Peace

      "I can feel the tension I can hear the screams From a generation --awakened from the American Dream." -- "Castle of Sand by R. Kochackis (1994)  10 years later and I still hear the screams.  I started reading the classic book  On Death and Dying.  I know how uplifting. I still suffer from a fear of living, it is in facing the inevitable that I have always hoped to find the strength to carry on. Odd, huh? Well, I guess I walk the symptoms of PTSD from the Shrinker's IV Book to the letter!  Maybe more later. The Simpsons are on. And hey, we all have to have our priorities and frankly, I have been on this machine for 4 hours. I'm tired.  Peace

      Hello everyone.  Tonight, Mike, Victoria and I meet with our new trainer, Melissa. She is going to teach us how to be a well adjusted doggy-human family. I am looking forward to understanding more about dog behavior and then perhaps I will learn a bit about how I tick as well.  I finally finished  Fast Food Nation.  I can say that it will be a long time before I eat at McDonald's again. It took awhile before I was able to eat meat again. But I love animals, they are tasty! :oP  I have been having this overwhelming sense of impending doom. That I will see the destruction of my country. And I believe there is very little I can do about it. This book only made this point stronger. I have always known we (America) were being sold out for big profits by the corporate gods, but I had never really given a lot of thought as to who these gods were or how they operated.  Now I got a small taste. And it tasted bad. I was talking to my former psychiatrist, Dr. Doherty, who is from Ireland, about these feelings; unsure if they are normal or part of my bipolar disorder. She told me what I was feeling is normal for someone who doesn't have their head in the sand. (That's not exactly where she said Americans have stuck their heads, but you get the picture). She said she is surprised that we haven't taken to the streets in protest over all that is happening to our country. That much of what happens here would never be tolerated in Europe.   I thought of this on Friday night as I sat listening to live music by a local guitarist at Common Grounds (one of our local independently owned coffee shops) with Debi, Alan, Matt and Brian. The guitarist began singing  What's Goin' On?  by Four Non Blondes. And as he sang, "And I pray. Oh my God do I pray. I pray every single day. For a revolution." I felt something stir in my heart and then die. I don't have an outlet for all the passions brewing in me nor do I have the resources to "change the world". I began to think, what would it really mean to pray for revolution. Well, that's it. I have done it now. As soon as I hit post I will have black listed myself for these treasonous thoughts. And for that matter, everyone who is listed in my links will be listed as sympathizers. God bless America.  Did you know that our beef processing plants have lower standards for beef sold in the US than in the European Commonwealth? It's true. Did you know that we really don't know if Mad Cow disease has been introduced to our food supply? That the incubation period for the disease in humans could be as much as 30 years? Did you know that dog food companies have taken more safety steps to ensure safety from Mad Cow than our beef processing plants? Did you know that beef producers have been changing libel laws in various states that keep people from speaking the truth. That the burden of proof in these new laws fall on the people making the accusations instead of the party that professes being libeled. In libel cases, it must be proved that monetary damage was created by said libelous information before a settlement against the libelous party can be made. Beef processors are changing these laws where they have the power to do so. In fact, my saying this is probably opening me up to such a danger. Cool. I said HEY, What's Goin' on! :oP  Speaking my mind, despite of the dangers.  Peace

      OK, so thank's to Debi, I now know who my alter poet is...umm..yeah...I want to publicly admit this:    Your alter poet is Allen Ginsberg. Quick, go nuts, because THIS IS GOOD FOR YOU!    urlLink   Who is Your Alter Poet?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Who knew?  Now, on to new things. I totally jacked up my wrist about a half hour ago. I nearly took a header into my cellar. I caught myself, by twisting my left wrist back in some inhuman fashion. Guess I'll have to find a new place for the bodies and the weed. Crap...did I just type that out loud....no doesn't work with type. Will have to think of another catchy way to say that some other day.  I trained with Whitney again today. And will do so again tomorrow. I told her that she is becoming nationally know...(well at least known outside of the state of KY because of my LARGE readership that is outside the state...ahem) I warned her that the atrocities will be recorded on here. She wants my blog address now. Oh Hi Whitney! See, I'm not saying anything bad. Just the truth. You will reap what you sow and Whitney has been proof of that. She always tells me, "I don't make any of my clients do what I won't do myself." I used to say the same crap to my clients. And it comes back to haunt me. LOL I used to think that a half hour session wasn't worth the time or money. Now, 15 minutes into the session, I wonder how much longer must I endure the suffer God? Forgive her Father, for she knows she is doing her job. (And enjoying it a little too much...I knew she reminded me of me for some reason). Hummm...I need to get Debi back into the gym. It's time to play pass it on.  Well, I'm going to go ice my wrist, and read some more blogs. I got a lot of catching up to do.  Peace.

      OK...so I went with the few people left in Lexington (that I know of) who hadn't seen the Passion of the Christ movie last night.  It wasn't as gory as I expected (that is not a complaint by the way). I found myself reacting to the film in unexpected ways. I wasn't sure how I would react, but I did cry, flinch, and wished Barrabas (the murderer who was freed instead of Jesus) would lunge out at the high priest on his way down into the crowd. But, alas, no Hollywood vengeance for Rachel.  As I have been studying and reading about the effect film can have on an audience, that film consistently helps the viewer transcend the here and now, this film took me back to a dark yet hopeful day in humanity, when the earth stood still and the angels cried for a innocent man hanging from a cross.   The only way to feel more like I was there, I needed only the warm middle eastern wind blowing in my face, the dust settling in the back of my throat, and the smell of sweat, tears and blood.   The blood didn't bother me. It was the blood-lust in the eyes of the Roman soldiers who gleefully tortured Jesus that bothered me. It made me realize that as a society, we are not much further from that. The beatings didn't bother me. It was the betrayal of Judas, using love for hate, kissing to hurt our Lord that bothered me.   My first tears fell as Peter denied Jesus in the crowd and he made eye contact with Jesus. They both had a flash back memory to when Peter swore he'd follow Jesus even unto death. I felt Peter's fear, anguish, and sorrow. I think I have tasted those same bitter tears many times before.   Mr. Gibson, thank you for your vision of the sacrifice of Christ.  On a lighter note...not that I take what Jesus did lightly...but it was a film. I noted that the actor who played Jesus had a personal trainer (who had a film credit at the end). I thought of Whitney, since today I had to train with her. I told her I had seen the movie, she asked me what I thought of it. I said it was intense. Then I told her I thought of her when I saw the trainer credit. I said that I wondered what was worse, a session with her or dragging a cross to my death. We had a good laugh. I said that after seeing the movie I had a greater appreciation for what Jesus went through and that I should quit being such a wimp. Her sessions are nothing compared to what He went through. This comment was followed by her making me do high-knee running in place for a minute, butt-blaster leg presses, and 2 minutes on the no recline bike on level 11. I could barely breathe. I thought I was going to die. And the whole time I thought of Jesus. Whitney doesn't realize it, but she is probably one of God's greatest helpers, she makes people cry out to God all day. LOL  Well, I'm off to train the dogs now. Misery loves company. Ha ha.  Peace.

      Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ has created quite a buzz in and out of the faith community. If you have seen the movie, what did you think? What disturbed you? What inspired you? The Herald-Leader might publish some reader responses and reaction in Faith and Values. Letters of 150 or fewer words should address some aspect of The Passion. Send them to  Passion Letters  Monica Richardson Lexington Herald-Leader 100 Midland Avenue Lexington, Ky. 40508 Include your name, age, hometown and daytime phone number. Letters must be received by March 31. Letters might be edited for space and grammar and will be verified.  Here is my entry:  To: Passion Letters:  I have been studying and reading about the effect film can have on an audience. That film consistently helps the viewer transcend the here and now. This film, The Passion of the Christ, took me back to a dark yet hopeful day in humanity, when the earth stood still and the angels cried for an innocent man hanging from a cross.   Perhaps this film wasn’t the greatest version of  “the greatest story ever told.” But the only way I could have felt more like I was there, I needed only the warm middle-eastern wind blowing in my face, the dust settling in the back of my throat, and the smell of sweat, tears and blood. I found myself transcended to the foot of the cross in a way no church service could duplicate. That is the power of film. Thank God we have this medium to enrich our lives.

      What is true love?  True love is sacrifice. It is doing what is best for those you love, regardless of how much it may hurt. I am learning this first hand. I am losing one of the loves of my life, Mike. In the effort of becoming a well- adjusted doggy-human family, I have discovered that the stress of change has brought some undesirable traits in Mike. In less than a week, Mike and Victoria have had 3 drag out ugly fights, one in which I was injured trying to break them up.  Something had to change. These fights could not be trained away. They could perhaps be slightly controlled, but for all our safety, the dogs would have to be separated, permanently. So much for the idea of each of them having the other for companionship. After a lengthy discussion with our trainer, Melissa, I made one of the most difficult decisions I have had to make in a long time. I had to chose which beloved dog had to go.  Knowing I was obligated to the Kentucky Boston Terrier Rescue to return Mike should his home life suffer, and knowing he would be placed in the perfect loving home. I reluctantly contacted the organization that night. By this weekend, Mike will be placed back into foster care. As much as this hurts me, I know it is best for Mike and Victoria and myself. But I will never be the same for his love in my life. I will miss him terribly.  If you are in the KY, OH, IN, TN area and would like to adopt the sweetest dog you ever met into your home. He would have to be an only dog, please visit  urlLink the Kentucky Boston Terrier Rescue  and bring home one of the best dogs I have ever had.  If you are not in these areas, and want to try to adopt Mike, go ahead and contact them anyway. maybe they'll let him live somewhere warm like California. He loves warm places, like my heart.

      Hello from day 5 of the Body for life Challenge.  So far, so good.  I miss mike terribly so it has been good to have something to throw myself into. I have a bit of the old Rachel back, which has been nice.  I can't wait until Sunday. That's the "cheat" day. I can have what ever I want. And boy do I have a list. I'm gonna have krispy kremes until I puke, and maybe some beer (maybe not until I puke) I found a new favorite beer called Blue Moon. You drink it with a slice of orange squeezed in it. I really, really really like it. Did I mention I really like it?  Tomorrow is my last cardio day of the week, I hope I can push myself as hard as Whitney pushes me. I have been staying with the 6 meals a day plan, but man...that's a lot of food. Somedays I have only eaten 5 meals. And these are small portions. The worst I have "cheated" was having dark meat chicken instead of white, and cornbread along with it. Oooo...bad Rachel. This program focuses on progress, not perfection. Exactly what I need to learn in my spiritual life as well. Hummm...funny how that happens.  God spoke to me and said that if I couldn't trust Him with this little think, how could I trust him with these bigger things coming up. I have a long road ahead. And I don't look forward to the pain it will cause me and those who love me. But I ask you all in advance for your grace and patience with me.  And finally, to those who won't see me for awhile. I have pierced my nose, lip, and tongue. Soon my eyebrows, and I have my ears pierced like a bunch of times. HR @ Anthem has no policy on piercings and since they won't insure me, and I do grunt work, it's only fair they let me have my self expression. I have asked permission. Just for my nose and eyebrow. Guess we'll see what happens.  Well...  Until next blog.  Peace

      Soooooo  I got all this testing done on me (aptitude, IQ, attitude...no wait...learning styles... :o) ) Anyway, it said my strong points were in, now, hold on to your seats...Writing, language, Art...and so on and so forth. My highest scoring field that I desire to do...things like stunt person, athlete, coach, etc. My next highest in which I actually have the aptitude and talent to do...all art stuff. As far as cinema goes, I can do well as a script writer. Well...what do you know?  I am on day 3 of my body for life challenge. Eating 6 meals a day is quite difficult. So far I missed the last meal on my first day. I feel like I am eating so much. But I feel good. Yesterday was my cardio day. You only have to do it 20 minutes if you really do a kick butt cardio. I have only one word to say about that, WHITNEY. Need I say anymore. Once again, I thought I was going to puke. I think I did a kick butt cardio day. Everytime she'd speed up the treadmill I'd get ticked, and finally I said, "I hate you." She laughed and said, "I love you too pumpkin." I know in a month, I will look back at yesterday (as Whitney has me running laps in the parking lot) and think I can't believe that seemed so hard.  Today I have to do lower body weight training. And tomorrow, I am in Whitney's hands again. And frankly, she is liking this whole thing a little too much. But I understand. I was the same way. Nothing like seeing someone else put in the effort you demand of yourself. Frankly, I don't know if I was as tough on my clients as she is on hers.  Well, off to therapy to discuss how I have associated pain with pleasure. No wonder I love working out!  Peace

      Hello again  I am finally posting. Don't know if anyone is reading.  I am going to start the 12-week body for life challenge by Bill Phillips. This has got to be the most well balanced, reasonable solution to weight control that I have seen in a long time.  I will be following this 12 week plan of weight training specific intensity exercises, cardio/vascular specific exercise and a six meal a day eating plan. Almost 1/2 a million people have made unbelievable transformations and I want to be one of them. Mostly, I really want to run that Mid-summer nights run in august of this year and I have lost no weight, only inches. I believe this will get me closer, if not in condition for this event.  I recommend this to anyone looking to change their life. I am starting tomorrow and I am already excited to do it.  It is a commitment, but so is taking care of one self. And I believe that there are a lot of spiritual concepts to be learned in this 12 week journey.   I will let you know how it goes.  In the mean time, I just wanted to post something and let everyone out there know I am still alive, kicking, fighting, and living. I will overcome.  Until next post...this is Rachel reporting. :o)  Peace

      Smashy Smashy  Yes, it's that time of year that I am thankful to be out of shelling range from my family. What am I talking about? Why our masocistic family Easter ritual of course. After Christmas all the families (at least 3) would save up flats of empty egg shells by breaking the tops only and saving the empties. Then all us kids (at least 3 of us) would fill them with confetti tape them shut and dye them. And there you have it, a complete arsenal.  Then after we went to Easter mass (and got dressed down) we would all go to one house have a meal and smash the eggs into each other's hair. For hours. And my head would hurt. Because some of my family can be real a##holes and real nail you. No names though.  I soon discovered that not all families practiced this ritual. In fact, no one had even heard of it. I thought everyone did it. And in the 4 years I have repeated this story to my various friends, I am surprised that I have not been ambushed, and shelled. :o) I am not asking any of you to do this! REALLY!! Just saying, knowing how some of you are, I'm just surprised. That's all.  It was 10 years ago on Good Friday that I was at Jim Morrison's grave. A life long dream. And I will not forget the emptiness I felt that day. He was my hero. And he was dead. And he didn't know I traveled all that way to see his grave. He's dead.  Later when I arrived in America, Kurt Cobain killed himself. These were two life changing events for me.  1994 my life was so different than it is now. It's better. Still painful, but better. And I will never forget hearing all the bells in Frankfort, Germany ringing on Easter morning. It was one of the most beautiful Easters I have experienced.  Peace.

      So  I promised to tell you about my visit with a local on-air-personality.  What can I say. People like me.  This local on-air talent works for one of the main radio stations I listen to down here. Z-Rock 103. The woman is a wild woman. She told me many things. Many things I will not repeat here. And all I will say is she and I have some common interests, we have been talking on the phone for over a year or so. She kept saying we needed to get together sometime to meet face-to-face. So on Tuesday, we did just that. Went back to her place and had fun. She told me everything about herself and her job and her cats. And if you want to know more than that, you'll all have to email me to ask. That's all I am saying on the WWW.  Peace

      Cree-ee-eek  And the door is open again.  I am making myself available for everyone to see.  See me?  :oD There I am.--Hi!  I am in a place again, that I can be so painfully aware of God's grace. It is painful, because all the wretches that live within you must be exposed. AND EXPOSED THEY WILL BE!  I hate the person I am right now. And I have all these pathetic little compartments in me. I musn't hate them. Rather, I hate what they make me do sometimes. I know the person I am right now is the only "me" I know. And that is the person who is the wretch that is being exposed. Do these parts of me mess up my judgement? Or is it that the consequences of the actions that I have committed are being visited upon me? I have sin that is being dealt with, and not these compartments. Get it right! I do. I see me. I sight is painful because I am nothing like I want to be.  But, as in Lamentations, I have hope. Because God grew me up in so many ways already. I know He will do it again. I just pray the lessons need not be more painful than they need to be. Please God. Be merciful! Have mercy on me for always taking such advantage of Your grace. It it's too great a concept for me to understand, this, LOVE. I can't even seem to love or even like myself. How do I learn to love You who I can't see? I believe I will see one day. I will see You. I catch You now and then. Glimpses here and there.  !!!WE INTERRUPT THIS SPIRITUAL MOMENT FOR THIS WORD FROM BODY FOR LIFE!!!  I have lost about 12-15 pounds. My weight goes up and down like a yo-yo during the day and the week. So, that is why the 12-15 deal.  I have gotten stronger. I can push myself harder. Often harder than everyone around me. I mean, I'm the only one working up a sweat and panting most of the time. Weight training! Today, I felt like I was my own "whitney" today, as in, I totally kicked my own butt. I am so tired. But I have to be careful because my latest and longest entanglement can derail me if I am not careful.  That's the latest as of today. Remind me to tell you about my visit with a local on-air-personality.  Peace.

      Greetings to all of you from a beautiful, warm sunny Kentucky day. Not blistering hot, just right. Ahhh.  Anyway, I was glad to have time to sit out on my deck and watch my dog run the fence line barking at everything in "her other yard". I am convinced she doesn't realize that the fence ends her territory.  I have been working really really hard on my Body for Life thing. I finally ran over a mile and a quarter in less than 20 minutes! And, I lived to tell about it. Whitney really pushed me hard. I know she could probably push me a little harder, but that can wait until I see her next week. ;o) I haven't seen any more weight loss but all my clothes are fitting looser. And I have gained a lot of strength. My eating has been my downfall. I keep either eating too much or too little. But, everyday gives me another chance to get it right.  I need to find a roommate. Those of you who do so, please pray I find a good one. I am planning on putting a ad in the paper. That is the necessity of my situation.  Still taping myself and documenting my life as it goes. I'll bet it's pretty boring. I haven't watched any of it.  In closing let me say that my back and biceps are very sore from yesterdays workout and to quote Martha Stewart, And that's a good thing. She better hit the weights where she's going...you know...you know what I mean. :oD  Peace

      Greetings all  Today is mother's day. Victoria got me a nice little gift. :o) She is so sweet. I hope all of you have a lovely day. Today was perfect. It was in the 80s and great convertible weather. Victoria and I have a lot of fun. She finally got the idea about sticking her nose out the side of the car. Everyone was waving and smiling at us. She is too cute, what can I say. BTW Victoria is my Jack Russell to those who don't remember.  I still haven't lost any weight according to the scale but my clothes are fitting looser. I have been working very hard still. Today was a nice break. I didn't go crazy with the food. My stomach can now only handle a little bit at a time. I guess that's a good thing.  I have two prospects for a roommate. One that I am not sure can happen but I think would be the best match for me and one who can pay the rent but I am not so sure I should choose this person considering her lifestyle. It isn't so much about pulling me in as it is asking her to abide by rules I have set. It's ok now, but what happens 2 or 3 months down the road? She also is handy at home improvement. I am not sure who to choose. I have left it up to God.  Tomorrow is work and my upperbody workout. I plan on the following. Chest: Dumbbell press 15 lbs x 12 (that means doing 12 reps with 15 pounds) 20 lbs x 10, 25 lbs x 8, 30 lbs x 6, and 20 lbs x 12 finishing my chest workout with flys 15 lbs x 12 Shoulders: Arnold press: 12 lbs x 12, 15 lbs x10, 20 lbs x 8, 25 lbs x 6, and 15 lbsx12 finishing with Shoulder Rounds with 2.5 lbs x 12 (those are harder than they sound) Back: One-Arm Dumbbell Rows: 15 lbs x 12, 20 lbs x 10, 25 lbs x 8, 30 lbs x 6, 20 lbs x 12 and finishing with Close-Grip pull-downs 65 lbs x 12. Triceps and Biceps: What I call, "The Rack" (any exercise starting from the heaviest weight I can do down to the lightest weight any number of reps moving down in weight as I go, working to exhaustion with no breaks in between weight changes.) That really kills! But it's awesome! This all should take me less than 45 minutes. Yeah, right.  I love weight training, I hate the cardio! I did over 1.25 miles in 20 minutes on Thursday and Tuesday we will take it up a notch. As I posted previously, Whitney will know if I am not working hard enough so it's best to 'fess up and tell her she can work me harder. Maybe I'll make 1.5 miles this week. God help me!  That's the latest.  Peace

      It has been a horrific thing to watch without control, my "compartments" come out and talk with people. I am finally Rachel again. I have been skipping thru some of them like a skipping CD. I was stuck last night. Liz was gracious enough to try to talk to him. Yes, him. These compartments get me to do stupid and irresponsible things. My therapist got to meet one in our session. I have total recall of the meeting, but I was not speaking. This is a very weird thing to deal with. And now you all know. You may be talking to Rachel, but Rachel may not me talking to you.  Better get to work. My internet is down so I am throwing this down at work.  And now I must get busy.  Peace

      Hello again. And welcome to My Not So Secret Life. I am your online personality, Rachel typing.  I finally got my power restored at my house. I went 25 hours with no power! Of course, some people got tornadoes in their neighborhood, but this blog is about ME! Seriously, no one was hurt that I know of thank goodness, but even the tornado neighborhoods had power and I didn't!  One of my neighbors had a generator going. It was terrible. I was trying to enjoy the evening, the moon was high and shining the only available light. The fireflies were in the trees. The stars were clear and perfect. All was peaceful, except for the constant BBBRrrrrrr of this damn generator! It was bad enough to be with out power. It was equally bad to know that someone else had power and you didn't. One side of the street was out the otherside wasn't for most of my street. I was terribly gleeful to see my neighbors across the street didn't have power. Yes, I know, it's terrible. But misery loves company. I wouldn't have complained if they offer me an extension cord though.  Today I am thankful to live in a country with the conveniences available to me. I am a most fortunate and thankful person today. I like my electricity. I like my solar powered hand cranked radio. What? Well, I have a radio that needs no batteries or electricity to run. All the neighbors sat round to listen to the one station that we could pick up on that hunk of plastic. The farm report. Just kidding. But I do have such a radio and it comes in handly when you don't have a friggin' generator to crank up your computer.  Until next blog.  Peace.

      Hello Everyone!  Thank you for visiting my blog again. I hope you find your visit worthwhile. I have a new current favorite song. It's called Roses by Outkast. It cracked me up the first time I heard it. The chorus says, "I know you like to think your sh(Radio Edit) don't stink, but lean-in-little-closer you'll see that roses really smell like poo-poo." No lie, that's the chorus. Is that funny or what?  I have been doing the karaoke/american idol thing. Yup, I've been singing. I have had strangers come up to me and tell me I sing good, why would they lie? Last song I sang was Fade Into You by Mazzy Star. I know, who? Well, if you heard the song, you might recognize it. It's a slow melancholy song. Everyone came on the dance floor and danced to it while I sang. It was cool. I felt so famous. :o) I do Melissa Etheridge very well apparently, those are the songs I get the most compliments on.  One guy, well, someone couldn't pick "better" songs for this guy to sing. First he sings "Creep" by Radiohead. "...But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo, what the hell am I doin' here? I don't belong here..." Off Key. Then he sang "With a little Help from my Friends." You know, "What would you do if I sang out of tune...would you stand up and walk out on me?" Off key. People did get up and walk out, but to have a cigarette. We are now a non-smoking city. Man, it killed business at the Karaoke place, finally people started coming in around 11pm. I got to sing like 3 times which is unheard of on a Friday night.  My phone now rings with In Da Club by 50 Cents, I also have some Nelly and Black Eyed Peas ringtones. I have the most stone groove phone ever my peeps. :oD I am full of...NO not that...bad reader...:oD I have tons of happy chemicals pumping through me between my meds and the exercise. I am in a mood! And it is good. Is it joy or mania? I don't know and I don't care!  Well my friends. That's all for today. Thanks for stopping by and taking time out of your busy day to read my little blog.  Peace.

      I just spent the morning on my deck with my guitar enjoying a beautiful day. I didn't know life without coffee could still be so good! I am so tired but I have slept so much.  I have been offered a full-time position at my job. I am planning on taking it. I hate being on disability. If I am going to make a go at a job, my current employer is the most understanding one I have ever had. He wants me to work for him inspite of the fact I may have some bad days that will keep me from doing my best or even being there. In fact, he told me if he can track my efforts to increased sales, not only would he give me bonuses, he offered me a new car. If I don't take the job, then I'll have to look for another one and stay on disability. I can see if I can handle the job and if I can't then I can go back onto disability.  I am looking forward to my visit home and the conference I am going to. My roommate situation is looking good. There is one person in particular I want as my roommate, but if it happened it wouldn't be until after summer.  I have been playing my guitar a lot lately. I really am getting better at it when I put the time in. I want to take it with me to Cali. I have case for it, but I am kind of scared to. We'll see.  I am still so sleepy. I think I am going to go nap a bit.  Thanks for reading.  Peace

      Hello everyone and welcome to my blog!  I had an exciting weekend. I have a pretty extreme fear of rain and driving in it since my hydroplane accident in my Miata 2 years ago. It stands to reason that would be afraid to drive after something so scary happening. But yesterday I was invited to visit with a friend, Maggie, near Louisville. I told her about my fear but how I needed to face it. I ended up driving through Henry County into the town of Eminence where they were cleaning up from Thursday's tornado that hit. It was a war zone. It was sunny most of my drive through these back roads. And after about an hour and 1/2 on the road I hadn't hit any real bad rain or anything. I was relieved. But about 2 minutes from the house in Oldham County (La Grange, KY) my radio went into the Emergency Broadcast mode and a tornado warning was issued.   Now to those who don't know, that means a funnel cloud has been spotted and you should take immediate cover. I made it to Maggie's house in time to hear the sirens about 20 minutes later. It was terrible! We went down into the wonderfully finished basement. Maggie's daughter Jenny and her husband Scott showed up because they live in Henry County were the tornados like to go. We had popcorn, chips, dip, veggies, chicken and dumplings, tea, soda and had the TV on to watch the tornados. It was kinda like watching the superbowl. I tell you, it was my kind of suffering through a tornado warning. One showed up about 2 miles south of where we were. And all the places I just drove through were getting slammed and in the path of potential tornados. Also 64 west was getting nailed. All the places I just drove through were getting nailed. I was so pumped full of adrenaline that I was actually excited. I kinda wanted to see a funnel cloud. I used to be terrified of tornados. Maybe I just don't have the respect for them I should have.   Maggie and I laughed about how I wanted to face my fear but tornados were a bit much. I stayed until the tornados passed and we talked and had a good time. Then around 830pm I decided I had better make a run for it while the getting was good. More tornado producing storms were expected in the area around midnight and I didn't have a change of clothes to spend the night. So I made a run for it. This time on good old safe highways instead of the back roads I had traveled earlier that day.  I drove 2 miles south of Maggie's home past where the tornado was spotted and I believed touched down. And it was highway the whole way. A bit more rain then I would have liked. I tried to keep it slow but I was so full of adrenaline and wanting to get home quickly that I kept pace with the cars that were doing about 80. I know. Stupid to do on wet roads. But I wasn't about to be anywhere in the area when those tornados came back. It was dark and I could see the clouds ahead of me in the distance as the lightning flashed. I know I saw what looked like a funnel cloud in the flashing. That only made me more alert to my radio. No EBS messages.  I drove down 64 East past more places that were nailed by the storm and tornado warnings. Then it started raining worse so I had to slow it up. I felt myself almost hydroplane twice. So not wanting another accident, I opted for a slower speed. Which is not cool when there are a lot of semi trucks around. They make the water on the road worse, spraying water at your windshield and making it difficult to see.  I was seriously thinking about cutting through Midway and Versailles, KY to get home and off the highway but that would mean winding wet back roads in the dark. I opted to say on the highway. I got off at the Winchester Road exit off I-75 south (this is the one closest to my home) and was met by blackness and a police detour. No power. I freaked. I thought about the 25 hours I spent with no power as I was sent down Sir Barton way. It was black until I got to the Hamburg pavilion (a shopping center) and made my way down Man O War to Todds road where there were HUGE puddles of water. One car splashed me so bad I couldn't see. Finally at almost 1030pm, I made it home. And I had power! I was so glad to be safe at home.  Then this morning, when the next storms hit (oh, at like 1 am) I watched as all the places I just drove through again were getting slammed by hail and potential tornados. It was amazing.  We got hit by the storm finally and it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. And I am glad.  All in all. Yesterday was an exciting day for me. I got over my fear for the most part, of driving in the rain. Any rain that isn't producing tornados will be fine with me to drive in.  Thanks for reading.  Peace.

      Apparently, I was up late last night surfing the web. I found an angelfire site that had the best info on this wonderful new "challenge" in my life. Those of you inclined to, please pray for me. I am doing things that I normally wouldn't do with little memory of it. All because of the following disorder. I recognize a lot of this in myself. Maybe some of you have notice some of these things I am not aware of. If you aren't sure you're talking to me, call me on it. I can't think another way to dig into this. Thanks to Amanda the author of the angelfitre site that I got this information from:  urlLink http://www.angelfire.com/psy/amanda/ddnos.html   Peace  Dissociative Disorder Not-Otherwise-Specified, often abbreviated "DDNOS," is a diagnostic category in the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-IV (diagnostic and statistical manual of Psychiatric disorders, current edition). Dissociative disorders include depersonalization disorder, Dissociative Amnesia, Dissociative Fugue, and Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), formerly known as multiple personality disorder. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder NOS is given when the primary problem involves dissociation, but doesn't fit any of the specified categories mentioned above. Often, this means the person has several features of several dissociative disorders, but doesn't meet the full criteria for any single disorder. It can also refer to atypical cases, or can simply be used when the doctor knows the problem fits into the general category, but needs to do more testing to figure out which one. This is usually the case for NOS disorders in the DSM-IV.   Often, people who present with multiple-personality-like characteristics are put in this category. In other words, these are people who experience themselves as having other sides to them, feeling like they are comprised of more than one person...but they don't meet all the specific criteria for dissociative identity disorder. Other cases of DDNOS include people who experience 'derealization' but not depersonalization, i.e., experiencing a dream-like state on a regular basis while awake... or frequently not being able to remember periods of time, but not ever feeling like they are a different person. Another example mentioned in the DSM-IV is dissociative trance, much like a hypnotic state. This would include "possession trance," or the replacement of one's personal identity by a spiritual identity or another person (assuming the trance is not being associated with broadly accepted cultural or religious practice).   In addition, the ICD-9 coding book (that hospitals use to assign a diagnosis to a medical condition - also the international standard) describes "Dissociative Disorder or reaction, unspecified" (code 300.15) as:   "A hysterical neurotic episode that produces sudden but temporary changes in perceived identity, memory, or consciousness; the individual experiences segregated memory patterns that exist apart from the individual dominant personality."  The word "hysterical" refers to an involuntary loss or impairment of some physical or psychological functioning (i.e. memory or sight) where an organic cause is ruled out. "Neurotic" is a psychodynamic term that refers to a condition where a maladaptive behavior serves as a protection against unconscious anxiety.   I call this the "many mini-minds" because I picture the integrity of the self being fragmented into a bunch of little pieces, which have their own ways of looking at the world and at the person they belong to, and have developed their own skills (useful and not) for handling the body they're attached to. Everyone has this to some degree, but I see a dissociative person as able to have several souls, feeling and thinking differently from each other, yet operating from the same body. Such seems to be the case with many people who are diagnosed with dissociative disorders.   While this site tries to cover issues that relate to most dissociative people, it probably most relates to what seems to be the most "popular" from of DDNOS, which is similar to dissociative identity disorder but parts/alters are less distinct and more co-conscious.  Dissociative Disorder NOS and symptoms I have been thru a long debate with myself whether what we experience is "real" and "valid." This is particularly an issue because we (speaking as a whole person) do not fit all the criteria to be diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder, yet we have many of the same experiences and symptoms. So what is this experience? It's the experience of feeling like a vastly different person at different times but still having some awareness that I'm still me. It's the experience of my conscience speaking in many voices and often distracting me from what I'm doing. It's the experience of knowing there's something not right, but not knowing quite what. And on other days there doesn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary going on.   What is dissociation?   When someone dissociates, there is a detachment of connections between thoughts, feelings, memory, action, identity, or awareness. Everyone has this to some extent but it becomes a "disorder" when it interferes with your life, occurring frequently and chronically. For instance, when someone tells you you said or did something and you don't remember it, you might get angry at them, and maybe later at yourself for lying or not remembering something.   Dissociation interferes with the normally integrated connections of behavior, affect (emotion), sensation (i.e., touch, hearing, vision), and knowledge (cognition and memory). People diagnosed with DDNOS usually have observable dissociation in the form of trance states (i.e. appearing "spacey"), amnesias, depersonalization (such as seeing themselves as if they were an observer), hallucinations, various voices in their head that are like multiple consciences, rapid age regressions, and shifts in knowledge, abilities and skills that the individual can't explain. Some experiences & symptoms dissociative people report:   Feeling like you don't have much of a sense of self...sometimes feeling "empty" and not there and sometimes hating yourself with a passion. Then again, sometimes thinking you're cool and everyone else sucks.   Feeling out of place or even like your body doesn't belong to you, or maybe like the world around you seems like you're in a dream. Experiences like these usually happen when life gets stressful. Much more of the time, you might feel ignored, rejected, "different," "special," or like "nobody really understands me."   Doctors have diagnosed you with depression, anxiety, personality disorders, bipolar disorder, and perhaps schizophrenia. You might frequently have trouble sleeping, thinking of suicide, self-blaming, mood swings, problems paying attention to things. People have told you you're moody, spacey, irritable, and have low self-esteem. They might frequently accuse you of lying about things you know are true. And after awhile, you start to doubt yourself.   In school you have/had problems concentrating, or maybe you were disruptive in class. Maybe you cry a lot and feel hopeless. You have a real bad memory at times. When taking a test, you sometimes blank out and nothing seems familiar, even though you can be sure you've studied it. Other times thoughts, memories, and ideas come to you faster than you can handle them.   You're startled easily. You're afraid of things that you feel you shouldn't be afraid of. And at other times these things don't bother you at all. Often you can't stand to be alone, and other times, you can't stand to be with people and withdraw.   You don't remember people's faces well. Sometimes people recognize you and start talking to you but you've never seen them before in your life. Or maybe they call you by a different name. You correct them, thinking they must be mistaking you for someone else. Then you start to doubt yourself.   Sometimes you don't remember what you did for several hours in a day. Maybe you have receipts for things you didn't buy. You think maybe someone's playing a game with you. You might realize you don't remember much about your childhood at all before a certain age.   Sometimes you just go blank, into a "trance" for a while. Afterward you don't remember what happened around you and sometimes even what you were thinking. You don't know why. When you need to recall important information, like say, your name, you can't even remember it and have to look at your driver's license. Maybe you've occasionally found yourself one place after being somewhere else and don't realize how you got there or what happened in between.   People have told you sometimes, "you're not making any sense." They tell you you were not yourself. More importantly, you didn't feel like yourself. You think you're in control of yourself, but you keep doing things and saying things and you don't know why you keep doing them when you don't want to...and you feel bad afterward.   You have conversations with yourself (sometimes out loud, sometimes in your mind), and when you do, the voices are distinctly different. You have names for the parts but you of course can't tell anyone else this or they'd think you're crazy. You get confused about your beliefs, values, maybe your sexual or gender identity too. Sometimes you hear things you know aren't there or a voice tells you what to do, and perhaps one of them tells you to hurt yourself. Sometimes you really honestly believe you're bad. Then, you don't know why you thought that.   About our experience from a collective point of view  During periods of stress our inner experience becomes very noticeable. Different parts in our mind often argue with each other and manifest themselves to the outside world as a person very inconsistent at different times. This can mean we see a friend as being untrustable and mean at one time and our best friend in the whole world at another time. We can feel like a great person and the whole world is against us at one time...and at another, we are so bad we have to beat all the badness out of ourselves with our hands or by cutting our body.   Sometimes the world can be extremely scary and we have to hide from it. Other times it feels like a dream. Sometimes we can feel like we're 30, 16, 8, or 5 years old...instead of 25 like we really are. Sometimes we feel great for no particular reason at all. Sometimes we feel empty and numb. And sometimes we can't account for what happened for maybe an hour or two.   We are easily frustrated and overwhelmed. We are aware that we have a radically different outlook on the world at different times, sometimes changing within minutes...but we can't always figure out why and how to go back to the way we felt before. We often get lost in daydreams, and sometimes we feel kind of lost and empty or like the world isn't how it usually seems. Some people would just say we're kind of "spacey" or "not there" at times. Criticism hurts us a lot. We have sensitivities to certain words or being touched in certain places and we have a lot of problems in interpersonal relationships, which tend to be very unstable.  People are put into categories all the time in their life. Medical diagnoses are convenient for doctors, but at the same time (and especially with psychiatric diagnoses), doctors might not agree with each other about a specific case. Being labeled with a psychological disorder can be traumatic in its own right (!), but can help you get the best treatment.   There is a relatively good amount of information and support on the Web for those with Dissociative Identity Disorder. Some of you, like me, may identify a lot with those with DID but realize that things are not quite the same or be confused as to whether you really are that dissociative, or if maybe it's other things (like "it's just my moods, I'm just a liar," etc). It's not an either-or thing ("I either have multiple personalities or I don't"), even though you may fall short of the DID dignosis. For those who are high on the spectrum of dissociation but don't fit into one of the dissociative disorders (i.e., dissociative amnesia, depersonalization, DID) specifically, you have a category too (for those times where you need one), and that is what is popularly termed DDNOS. So if you aren't "specified" does that mean you do not exist? Well in my mind's experience, it can sure feel like that sometimes. Regardless of the amount and complexity of dissociation you experience, and wherever you are on the continuum of dissociation, you DO belong somewhere and your experience is just as real and legitimate as anyone else's. (For more clarification and info, try here.)   It has also been common in my experience as well as others', to go back and forth about thinking, "I have parts" and "I'm making this up and I'm really just like everyone else." Many people will say that "everyone has parts." Well, this is true, as in being a different person at home than at work. But the "average person" doesn't have intrusive voices and serious confusion over their identity. They aren't really bothered by the fact they act like a different person with their children versus with their co-workers. In a dissociative individual, these switches can come rapidly and at the wrong time, causing that individual (and the people around them) to wonder what's happening. There is seems to be a quality of disconnection with oneself during the times the parts "take over." This doesn't happen to non-dissociative people.   Differences between DID and DDNOS: A lot of people wonder what's the difference...but the answer isn't really that simple, because people with DDNOS, and even DID, can be at various places along the continuum of 'pathological' dissociation. Also, DDNOS doesn't ONLY refer to people who have personality fragmentation, but also those who dissociate in various ways but experience themselves essentially 'whole.'   Generally speaking though, people with DDNOS don't have clear-cut ("separate and distinct") alter personalities and often don't have amnesia during a "switch." Often the parts don't have names and parts or fragments are much more often co-conscious, where the person feels like s/he is observing themselves acting differently than normal, but not fully in control of their behavior. It is like one personality part is in control, and the other one is watching...so there is no amnesia. Another way to describe it is that instead of having amnesia during a switch, you experience depersonalization. Finally, it's important to realize that if you are diagnosed with DDNOS, it (1) doesn't necessarily mean you were abused, and it doesn't mean you weren't, and (2), it doesn't mean (if you were abused) the abuse you endured was necessarily less serious than someone who has DID.   Another presentation of DDNOS is when a person experiences the blackouts, the "losing" time" of DID but doesn't feel as if they have a separate identity. It should be noted that people who present with symptoms of severe dissociation like I described here often are put into the DDNOS category but later, when the psychiatrist (and perhaps the patient) knows more about the person or he/she has undergone more testing, the diagnosis is changed to DID. Whether one is DDNOS or DID may not be very important because the issues and treatment are pretty much the same.   Multiple diagnoses: DDNOS often is just one of several disorders you can be diagnosed with....many people have both DDNOS and another disorder. Common ones are depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, borderline personality disorder, panic disorder, PTSD....the list goes on. This of course, further complicates the diagnostic picture and can make you feel like you're really screwed up!

      My power has went out 3 times in less than 2 weeks.  I began to think of how everything I seem to do is a distraction. I pass time. I have not been living.  There is great pain welling up. I don't know what it is or where it is from or how to let it come up and out. I just know that it triggers my defense mechanisms and I check out. I watch from far away as I do things I never dreamed I would do. All to distract myself from the pain. It has all the logic of punching myself in the arm to take my mind off the knife in my heart.  Everything I do leaves me empty. I am feeding something that can not be satisfied. It just wants more. And it has me by the throat right now.  And the people I have been meeting. I feel their emptiness too. I feel their pain. I hurt for them. I know, I know, point them to God is what some of you are saying. Well, how can I do that when I don't even know how to relate to God myself?  I have head knowledge of God. I know all the shalts and shalt nots. I either do right by habit, grace, or because it's what I am supposed to do. But I don't do it because I am in love with God. That is what I need to have change start. And I know this. But what do I do with that knowledge?  I feel like I am wounded. Everyone around me is wounded. And I can't find the way to the ER.  So ends the peek into my world.  Peace

      OK  Time to lighten up a little.  Last night I was trying to watch Law & Order. And of course, the weather warnings kept interrupting the programming.  It was driving me up the wall.  I began to think about the return of Jesus and how that might look being covered by the "MAX Track" Doppler radar, The 3D Viper radar...etc. and so forth.  Cue Anchorwoman:  Sorry to interrupt but there has been a reported sighting of Christ. As you can see from our doppler radar, we are now on a Jesus Watch for all of Fayette County. Our Viper 3D radar shows where we are tracking Jesus (cut to graphics as anchorwoman continues) reports out of Clay County, where the Lord has been spotted, along with the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse include reports of destruction along with many being caught up in the air to meet Jesus. We have Bob Smith live in Clay County. Bob?  Cut to Bob in the field:  Yes Jessica, it's true. We are witnessing the return of Christ. Local officials report that all those who have not repented are being....Awwwurgh! (Static...live feed lost)  Jessica speaks:  Bob? Bob are you there? We lost Bob. (momentary pause) This just in, we are now under a Jesus Warning for all of Fayette County. Officials suggest you take shelter at a local church or repent right there in your homes. Repeat...Fayette County is under a Jesus Warning.  Ok...I don't mean this to be blasphemous. Just trying to think of a worse case scenario, and how the local news would cover it.  Hope it gave you a good laugh.  Peace.

      Very sorry for the lack of communication. I have become somewhat of a hermit recently. But, now, I am forced from hiding because I am forced into socializing. I now have a roommate and it's like a family situation in that my roommate's son is temporarily staying here too. It's actually been refreshing and I have been learning a lot.  I realized today that I choose to find the quickest most viable answer to everything I do. This is part of the survivalist thinking I think.  My compartments are feeling a little more integrated lately. More like voices of my thoughts rather than whole sections of my personality leaking out for the world to see.  My Fourth of July was uneventful. Well, it was kinda painful. For some reason, that holiday brings to mind people who I've cared about and who are no longer a part of my life. I also felt a bit sick because...well...no sugar coating it...I had too much to drink. I know I wasn't staggering or anything, but I was definitely more...animated.  All in all, the craziness is settling down. My biggest problem (which I won't post...those of you who need to know...know) has become less so. I think a lot of that has come from this centered feeling. This pseudo-integration. The drive the need...whatever...it's tamed. And I can't explain why. Maybe it's just God's grace because I am sure thankful for this time of peace. There were times I wasn't sure I was going to make it. But rather than having a sense of "arrival" I have this dread of "This is a rest stop--there's more mountain to climb" and I am beat. But I think about the death march (if I haven't blogged about this--ask me to) and how no one was going to hike me out of there but me. So the sooner I get up the sooner I'll get to the end. At least that day came to an end!

I talked wit my homey Bill and maybe he might let me use his ride da mini coop to cruise to LA. Won't that make me the hit of the E zone? :o) Those of you in the know, know what the E zone is, those of you who don't, you'll have to ask and I will use stealth in who I reveal this to.  I have been anxious about the trip. I get that way about any trip where I fly...no just any trip.  I can't wait to see everyone in cali. It's like some beautiful dream. There is a niece I have yet to meet (Bill's daughter) and my nephew Issac who loves the Chargers (what's not to love about that kid?) and I haven't seen Angela (Bill's wife) in forever.  Not to meantion all my fam and other friends that I am so looking forward to seeing.  Well...I am too excited to type anymore.

      Hello from Azusa Pacific College in Azusa, CA and the 29th Annual Exodus Freedom Conference!   This has been quite a week of fellowship, worship and of course no conference would be complete without the pain that God digs up in me at these things!   Today was our free day and all my KY peeps went to Ventura, CA to go to the beach. I was supposed to go since Bill was kind enough to let me use his Mini Cooper.   Well, the Mini Cooper...there is a story in it self there! Bill spent about 25 minutes explaining all the gauges (I'll have to get photos) buttons, and warning lamp indicators. I didn't know if I was borrowing a car or getting my pilot's license. :o) I never found the horizon or altitude indicators. But seriously, it is a sweet little ride. And the best part, when you take off in 1st gear, you absolutely MUST start off at 2500 rpm...bummer. :oD And baby can it corner...oh...maybe I shouldn't post that here. :o)   Back to the beach story. I was supposed to drive some of the ministry peeps out to the beach. Frankly...other than hanging with everyone...I didn't really want to go. I hate driving in LA and hate waiting in the parking lots called the 210 and 101 freeways. To make a longer story even longer... :o) someone in the backseat pipes up, "Hey! One of those warning lights is flashing!" To my horror...I suspected it was the flat tire indicator...and after pulling the convoy over and checking the owner's manual...it was. So, as per Bill's instructions...I checked all the tire's pressures and found they were all different and the front right tire was low. I made sure all the tires had 25 psi as Bill had told me they should have and called the Mini Cooper USA Roadside Assistance number. Yikes! I had to take it into the dealership!!!   I sent everyone else on their way to beach and told them to have fun...I had to take care of this. Fortunately, my passengers were able to squeeze in the remaining 2 cars. I called Bill and he told me to just take it to a tire place, it probably picked up a nail and needed to have a tire patched. No big deal.   So off to a local tire place. I was told that an old patch was leaking and it could not be repaired. I was to watch the pressure and it should be ok to drive on. It was up to Bill as to whether or not he wanted to replace the tire. Well...this car is pretty cool. You can drive on flats. The tires are like rocks...so long as&nbsp;the tire pressure is monitored...the tire can be driven on&nbsp;until it goes bald.   Now, here I am with a cool car and no place to go. Kinda like at home with my Miata. :o) And no one to go anywhere with anyway. I might take in a movie. The theater is across the street from the campus.   I finally made another entry in my video diary. Taping atop Trinity Hall...the dorms where we are staying in. In the background you can see the lovely haze of smog wafting along the peak of the foothills in the distance of this high desert-like city. It's been in the 80s and 90s this week. Very dry. Yesterday the fires in the state cause smoke to be trapped in the valley area the city lies in. Oh how it made me homesick. :o)   God has been showing me a lot this week. I broke down and cried many times. At points I was being harassed with dreams and thoughts of suicide...the pain was so intense. The Exodus staff and CrossOver staff all informed of this...they are keeping an eye on me. It was suggested to me to take it easy an not go to as many workshops and give myself a break. So...I took ALL of today off. I didn't get out of bed today until 11am and skipped breakfast and lunch. Then the car thing happened.   God has been showing me some of the roots of my gender identity confusion and situations in my childhood that brought them about. Also...all the compartmentalization and how it plays into it. And this is where God is really cool. See...I didn't want to come to this conference. I feel like I live and breathe this material...why do I have to trek out to CA and hear all this stuff again? I told God...if you want me to go you better rain money down from heaven because I can't afford it. Boom! I get 4 grand the next week. OK...well...I know all this stuff...why do I have to go? and God said...maybe you're suppose to go to support someone else, ever think of that? Oh. OK...I guess I'll go. Well the very first night of the conference&nbsp;I was introduced to a girl who is having gender identity issues and needed to talk to someone who could understand. Ideally another woman. In fact, she prayed and asked God to bring her someone at this conference....humm. Naw...must be a coincidence right? Maybe...but she has the room right next to mine. Whoa! We were both amazed and thanked God.   I felt bad talking to her. I mean...I'm blazing my own trail, trying to find my own way. I don't have answers and I don't have it all together. There aren't really any Christian resources for women with this issue. But, God imparted His wisdom and I was able to challenge her belief system. God opened my eyes and showed me all the steps in her story that led to her beliefs about herself and fears of womanhood. A lot of them were my own as well. And so, yesterday, in the depths of my pain, God used me to minister to her and challenge her. She's stuck and afraid to move forward. And I could see where she was stuck. And God gave me the words to gently nudge her out of that place. I challenged her not to take my word for it but to ask God if what I was saying was true for her or not. I know it was God speaking through me. Just hours before I was being bothered by pain and thoughts of self harm. And suddenly, as I spoke with her, all this wisdom came pouring out of me and ministered to me as well. It is in those brief moments that you get glimpses of heaven. It makes me wish I could live in those moments forever.   Thank you to all of you for your prayers and support. I miss all of my KY friends back home.   Until next entry.   Peace.   One.

      Hello from California!  Gosh I miss central air! It's hot and icky here in South Cal. I have a ride to the conference. I get the mini cooper...yeah!  OK...so here's the latest. How would you feel if you came 2600 miles to see your parents to discover that your father had a heart attack the week before and your parents decided not to say anything to you because you were coming out there anyway?  Well...after it set in I was ticked. Yes. My dad had a heart attack and they didn't want to worry me. Nevermind the fact that I could have been home in time for his funeral. Today my father told me an unsettling thing. He said that when he dies no one was going to lift a finger to help me. ???! I am not sure what he meant by that but I just thought it best not to say anything. Better not to be a fool and say anything than open my mouth and remove all doubt...or however that saying goes.  My dad is basically buying me my KY house. It's almost 1/2 paid. He has no will, no life insurance and it sounds like no plans for my mom if he goes before her.  All in all...you can say I am a bit freaked out. I had been worried about my parents for months and to have something like this happen...well...it just cements my fears. I can't say anything or it will upset them. So, I'll just make it a matter of public record. Heck...neither of them ever surf the net.  Until next time.  Rachel signing off.  One.

      NEW NEW NEW NEW NEW NEW NEW NEW NEW NEW NEW NEW NEW NEW UpDaTeD Entry...ReAd Me!  Mini Cooper, Mini Cooper, Mini Cooper! Is that all you care about?! :o) (Bill, make sure you read everyone's comments on my last entry.)  This weekend, please pray for me. I am uneasy being in town with this weekend being...umm let's say the annual celebration of alternative lifestyles.  I went to Balboa Park with my brother today. The festival was being set up and I just have this torn feeling of homesick pangs and I need to run away!  Last night I went and saw our Padres in their new stadium in downtown. Very cool. We won. Even better.  Here's the new part. Tonight I went to a midnight showing of The Village for several reasons. 1) I don't have to work tomorrow, so I could. 2) I promised to take my brother to see it for his birthday and we love midnight movies and 3) I was DYING to know what the heck was in those woods!  I have only one regret. That I wasn't back in Kentucky where I could have caught it 3 hours earlier than here. :o)  I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I won't. I will say that it left me silent at the end and it took me 25 minutes to decide that I needed to see it again to digest everything.  I was very disappointed that our audience was all college-aged students. This was a movie that really made me think not just about what was being said, but the subtext as well. Something that the rest of the audience obviously couldn't appreciate. But what can I expect from an age group that deifies the American Pie movies, thought the Blair Witch Project was the greatest movie ever and that Green Day invented punk...to quote Michael Jackson, "They're just ignorant!" Oh world, forgive me for all the stupid things I said and did at that age.  Frankly, I don't know how the exit polls will be on this movie. Perhaps the rest of America may agree with my young audience members. More is the pity. Well I agree, there are somethings that could have been done better (I can't be specific or I'll spoil the movie) overall I found it to be a very creative storyline with a plot that was completely unexpected.  All in all, I can say, I can sleep soundly tonight now that I finally know the big secret...he he he.  Peace.  ONE
