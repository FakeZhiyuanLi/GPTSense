       One day and night of fun. After all the dial in's and unpredictablility of the track and tire with night driving we ended up going to damn fast. But it wasn't a total waste. Mark and Bob took the last race with Mark coming out on top for the win. Good job. Next time looks like we will be a Breamerton Raceway. See ya there!  Jason  Ps. Pictures to come soon.

Here is a repost of what was said  LOCAL MOTORSPORTS Morris races VW to national victory    Chris Horn    August 29, 2003   Port Orchard's John Morris traveled to Woodburn, Ore., last weekend to compete in the National Hot Rod Association Summit Sport Compact Series, a national traveling series. Morris, 34, in just his second season of competition, entered his 1957 Volkswagen in the ET-1 class. It was his first NHRA event and he won it, topping a field of 76 cars with a best run of 11.44 seconds at 115 mph.  The VW is mostly stock in appearance but has a 1900cc engine with one stage of nitrous oxide.     Jay Out
