						   This report comes from the  urlLink Bloomberg  news website.  The WTO talks are demanding lowering of tariffs on industrial products, as well as reduction of barriers on importing certain agricultural products from the Third World. The agriculture problems has received the most attention during this round of talks.  Though trade is necessary to keep a national economy going, it must not be the backbone of it. To be prosperous, a nation must have a decentralized government and economic structure. It is a tenet of Distributist Thought that the local economy takes precedence over the global economy, even if that local economy is that of the nation. Leaving trade decisions to a would-be world controller like the WTO is folly.  Fixing of tariffs rates between nations must be negotiated between the nations themselves, not through enemies of national economic sovereignty like the WTO.

						   This is a disturbing report out of the July 31, 2004 edition of the  urlLink Asia Times , linked via the libertarian website Antiwar.com.  There is a growing coalition of Maoist Communist rebels in several poor regions in India. They have, like others of their ilk, taken over the hinterlands of several Indian states, ruling them as "shadow governments". They collect taxes, terrorize small businessmen and clash with the police when they wished. They recent began contact and links with other Maoist Communist groups throughout the Indian Sub-Continent, as well as the mostly tiny fellow Maoist parties globally.  Police and local politicians, according to the Asia Times report, are butting heads over what to do regarding the Maoist rebels, some wanting to crush them, others wanting to open peace talks with them.  Those folks who believe the lie that "Communism is dead" and "the Cold War is over" are in the wrong. The bloody beast of Marxism-Leninism is still alive, and is making gains still. The Indian hinterlands and the poor areas of Nepal are just the latest of their newly-added territories.  Do not be lulled into complacency! The Reds are still as much a threat to freedom as is the radical Islamists, multinational conglomerates, the UN and their supporters, and the promoters of the Sexual Revolution. The more our sad, sad world knows about Distributism and puts it into practice, the less we will see of these troubles. It is not a cure-all for all the world's problems, but it will help to alleviate many of them.

						   This is a weird but true story out of Sri Lanka, a story which would make even E. F. Schumacher scratch his head.....or at least, give him a good chuckle.  A group of modest businessmen have been combining recycled cardboard and elephant dung into usuable writing paper! No fooling! This story was written by the French news group AFP and put up on an  urlLink Australian news website.    The original seven-man workforce has blossomed into 122 employees. Their product has been so successful, people in the Marxist-rebel held Tamil Tigers area in the north of the island nation may begin their own paper factories. The former Sri Lankan prime minister presented President and Mrs. Bush with gifts of this unique paper. Demand for this product is increasing.  And yes, it IS de-odorized.  In it's own off-kilter way, this factory fits the Distributst milieu. It is a small, locally-owned business - which Chesterton supported - and it is employing Third Worlders with technology suitable for their area - which Schumacher advocated.  Thanks be to God for some good news from this area.

						   This article from the American right-wing news site  urlLink Etherzone  is a sad one.    Sean Scallon, a newspaper reporter and regular columnist for the site, told of a small, family-owned newspaper in Green Bay, home of the Packers football team. It was the only competition to the major daily owned by Gannett Inc., who also owns USA Today. The small paper fought this branch of Gannett for over 20 years, but finally the owner had to sell to them. The chain - owning 150 papers nationally, along with USA Today - used it's muscle to drag the small paper down to defeat.    This should be more fuel for our fire, so to speak, to work to smash the power of the chain storesand other like conglomerates. Yes, too many of us Distributists shop at chain stores or buy chain newspapers and so on. It doesn't mean we should approve of them, or throw our hands in the air and say "all is lost" in the fight against them.     This is one of Distributism's permanent campaigns:  to permanently brake the power of chain stores and chain companies.  So, to use this story for an example, we must continue to craft laws - nationally and state-wide - to favor the independent media outlets. Not just on the Internet, for far too many cannot afford to get on it, or don't know how. But also in the print and broadcast media. So the tax burden on the family-owned or worker-owned and managed papers or radio or TV stations must be lifted for good. Conversely, the tax and regulatory burden on the chains - including Gannett, New York Times Corp. and so on - must increase until they are forced to sell them or spin them off as independent companies.    Centralization of ownership of the media into fewer hands - whether of big government or big business or both - is immoral and unhealthy to any sane society. Hence, we should mourn the loss of another family-owned newspaper to a left-wing chain like Gannett, and promote the campaign against newspaper chains,  no matter how long it takes.

						    urlLink The Onion - University Implicated In Checks-For-Degrees Scheme   Absolutely hilarious paraody but shows the average universities' vaunted mission for what it is: an elaborate certificate with no guarantee of employment. When a college becomes a vocation school (which most are nowadays) you combine large cost with none of the minimal apprenticeship features of a vocational school. Of course a guild solves much of this problem.

						   Folks, this is an article from ZWNews.com regarding the poor people in Zimbabwe (the former Rhodesia). The Marxist dictatorship of Robert Mugabe has so shrunk the national reserve of foreign currency, as well as wrecked the national health system, that they are now introducing  ox-drawn ambulances  to bring rural sick people to hospitals.   This poor nation, since the rise of Mugabe, has been withering down to nothing. Zimbabwe has become like too many other sad nations in Africa - and they need to know about Distributism in economics and politics, so as to give them some sense of hope.   Here is the urlLink  link:

						   This is an  urlLink article  from 2001 by Paul Glover, founder of Ithica HOURS, one of the more famous "alternative currencies" projects in the English speaking world. This article is about promoting "globalization" by local investment and "alternative currencies".  My concern here, though, is in his belief that we need to globalize at all. It does not help forward the Distributist cause, which is - on principle - opposed to any form of World State or "global governance". Remember the quote of Lord Acton about power corrupting. It applies to the economic sphere as well as the political sphere.  Building up local communities, especially in economics, is necessary to keep a strong, sane and peaceful society. But linking it to the - to be blunt - Satanic movement to swallow all nations into the blob of a World State is contradictory, at least.  Roy

						   There has been many movements to promote local "alternative currencies", so as to keep much needed revenues within the local community, and helping local businesses. Well, I have discovered a  urlLink website  promoting one that has been a raging success in this part of Pacific Canada. And, with the right tweaks, could probably work elsewhere - at least in north America.  This successful venture is on Salt Spring Island, British Colombia in Canada.  Roy

						   Here is some wonderous  urlLink news  from the Times of India, via WorldNetDaily. This is about a refrigerator built for the poor and middle class of clay. Simply clay.....and it WORKS!  Were he still walking among us today, E. F. Schumacher would be pleased as punch...as I'd guess Belloc and Chesterton.  Roy

						   This wild but hopeful report is from the monthly US paleo-conservative magazine  urlLink Idaho Observer , the July 2004 edition.  There is a team from the University of Illinois that is researching how to turn - of all things - pig manure into a type of crude oil that can be used for heating homesand creating electricity.  With world oil refinery building not keeping up with demand, and billions of barrels of crude oil in northern Alaska  still  untouched thanks to both eco-Marxist propaganda and Congressional refusal to allow drilling, such projects such as these are even more necessary in generating fuel.  When combined with further research in making alternative energy cheaper, fuel conservation, de-centralizing the electrical grid and other things, America's energy security wil be made stronger. Hopefully, this can be imitated and adapted by other nations.  Chesterton and Schumacher would probably approve.

						   This report is from the South Korean newspaper  urlLink JoongAng Daily . They have reported that the Rev. Sung Yung Moon and his "Unification Church" has opened a factory in Communist North Korea to make cars for the Asian market.  Rev. Moon, who was recently crowned a "messiah" in a public ceremony in Washington, has been dealing with the brutish, thuggish regime for many years. According to the report mentioned above, Moon's car company - owned by the Church - will be making and selling copies of two Fiat models for China and Vietnam, among other nations. The average North Korean worker cannot afford to buy one, buy gas for it, or much less know how to operate and take care of it.  Once again, we see big government and big business joining hands to squash the little guy. The North Korean state, still technically in a state of war with the US, crushes and brainwashes her people within her Marxist dystopia. Rev. Moon, who's Church is widely regarded by many as a cult, wishes to make his birthplace in North Korea a rival to the Vatican. His businesses are working with North Korea to keep it afloat.  Hence the Reds in Pyongyang remain in power, and the people suffer. If the Communist state there is  ever  eliminated, it will take at least a generation for the poor souls there to be de-programmed from their slavishness to Marxism...and support Distributism.

						   This is from the pro-John Kerry website  urlLink Intervention  magazine.  Just like the report below this one regarding Illinois, President Bush wants every American to be tested for mental illness. This is to be called the “New Freedom Initiative.” Children and school personnel will be the first to be screened. According to Intervention, that means  52,000,000 students and 6,000,000 adults  who work at the schools will be targeted.  That is  one-fifth to one-fourth of the whole country's population.   Whether Bush or Kerry or a third-party candidate wins the White House this election, this new type of big government program must be quashed from the get-go. NOW!!!

						   This report comes from the Protestant news and ministry website "We Hold These Truths", routed via the Couples Company  urlLink website.   The state of Illinois passed a law in July of 2004 that commands compulsory mental health screening for both children -  up to age 18 -  and pregnant women. As reported in the newspaper the Illinois Leader, this foul edict - enshrined last year - passed their State House by a 107 to 5 vote, and the Senate passed it unanimously.  This means the STATE - not you or your doctor - the STATE decides if you are mentally healthy or not. This has shuddering precedent in the old Soviet Union, who regularly put away many political opponents of Communism in mental wards. This violates privacy also.  At worst, unless this law is overturned after the current elections, it means pregnant women who wish not to have the Illinois government hover over their children's mental health will have to flee the state. But in the immediate future, it is  imperative  that Distributists and others of good will stop similar plans for their own particular state or Canadian province.  Further, this law in Illinois must be overturned - either in the legislature, courts or both - no matter how long it takes....whether it takes months, years, or even decades!

						   This report - dated today, August 9, 2004 - comes from Wired magazine, via the alternative news website  urlLink Prison Planet. com.    The blasted ACLU has found out that the US government is using big businesses to do surveillance jobs for them, so as to sneak around restrictions against domestic spying. For all we know, other non-Communist governments are doing the same.  "Hudge and Gudge" - Chesterton's words for big government and big business - despise any sphere of legitimate privacy and anonymity. They wish to eliminate it, but by patient slicing away of our freedoms, a little here, a little there. Such schemes like this must be permanently reversed, and never implemented again in any way, shape or form, here in the US or elsewhere.  Here is the link for the  urlLink story:

						   The San Francisco Chronicle has a report out recently that Wal-Mart's employment practices costs California about $86 million annually in public assistance to company workers.  It seems typical of Wal-Mart, who - quoting Shakespeare from his play "Julius Caesar" - "bestrides the narrow world like a Colossus".  The study, put forth by two members of a pro-union institute in Berkeley, notes that if other supermarket chains did what the global chain does regarding their employees, it will cost California taxpayers over $410 million in public assistance.  And this at a time where, like too many other American state governments, they are operating on a tight or deficit-riddled budget.  If national and state that restricted the size and power of the chain stores were still in effect, such a situation affecting California would not be. If the dollar were not taken off the gold standard in the first place, the Wal-Mart workers' wages would be able to buy more without wrecking their wallets. But both big government and big business doesn't care, or doesn't seem to care.  Here is the  urlLink link:
