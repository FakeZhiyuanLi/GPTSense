      "讓我聽聽你的聲音﹐好不好,"我戰戰兢兢的問著。 "嗯..好吧"你好象顯得有些猶豫. (我知道﹐在我不說聲音的情況下﹐要你一個人獨白﹐是多麼不公平,但我真的好想聽到你的聲音) "yeah..這樣我便不會失眠了"我高興的孃著. "....."  親愛的D, 我知道﹐這是個無理無理的要求﹐而你卻欣然答應了. 抱歉﹐曾經無數的夜晚裡﹐你總會半夜把我驚醒﹐然後講電話. 或許是習慣了你三更半夜打電話過來﹐ 或許是習慣了聽見你的聲音﹐ 所以 我養成了"聽到聲音"才能入眠的怪習慣. 這個夜裡﹐我失眠了﹐只想輕輕地閉上雙眼﹐在無聲的夜裡﹐聽著你安撫的聲音﹐沉沉的睡去....

      嚴重失眠了。 懶洋洋地躺在床上﹐專心一一的為你鍵入每一個文字﹐把思念融化為簡訊﹐傳送給你. 手中握著手機﹐我狠狠地盯著手機﹐期待著你的回信。 時間一秒一妙的流逝﹐而我卻等不到你的reply. 真傻﹐我竟然期待一個陌生人的回應。    親愛的D, 我只是突然想你﹐別無其他.

      失戀雜誌裡頭的每日手札﹐已經達到一個無法容忍我想法的地步了。 原以為找到一個屬于自己的世界﹐奈何卻因沒有繳 $ 而無法繼續試用。 沒輒了﹐只好找另一個能夠容忍我的地方。

      突然好寂寞. 寂寞來襲﹐讓我不知所錯﹐頓時覺得呼吸困難. 我只想被人群包圍著﹐感受那份溫暖. 無奈﹐感到被排斥.

      終于過關了. 我已經像一個只有外殼﹐沒有靈魂的人了﹐每當寫完一篇作文時﹐我都會如此認為。整個人﹐就像被掏空了一樣﹐絞盡腦汁,只為求寫一篇好文章,那種感覺﹐像極了手機d電池用完了﹐也需要充電一樣。  27.5.2004

      夜色已深，數不清的星星探出頭來，靜謐的微笑，像是提醒人們世間的美妙與光亮。即使在黑夜，上帝仍然善意的留了無數盞光明給地球上的人們。但今晚的星兒看不見滿天光亮。她悲傷著，但卻不明白悲傷從何而來。她沉重著，卻不知道自己究竟背負了什麼。她憤怒，卻也全然不知怒火究竟為誰點燃。一切一切都處於茫然無知的無力狀態，這種時候，她只能強迫自己繼續負擔這些莫名其妙的情緒在血液裡洶湧的亂竄亂搞。 她覺得自己快瘋了。 想去流浪…。  「不要愛我。」星兒懇求。 「來不及了。」杰略帶冷酷。昔日的殺氣逐漸活了回來。 「我終究會離開你的。」 「沒關係。」他的聲音冷靜異常。 「我不想傷害你。」 「妳沒有。這一切都是我自願。」 「我的生命裡面沒有停留，只有來去，誰都不該記得誰的。這樣，對彼此都好。」星兒感覺自己臉龐濕潤了起來。 「當妳來去的中間，我可以等待。」杰的眼神夾雜著固執與堅定，說完便輕聲走到冰箱旁，小心翼翼開了罐啤酒，憂鬱地灌下一口苦澀，象徵他對她的愛情。

      如果能夠的話 我希望能不要用腦袋想東西 因為那樣是最費力的了 任何事情 如果只要義氣用事 那該有多好 因為那是年輕的最佳寫照。 唯有小孩﹑未長大的孩子﹐才能這樣 也因為如此﹐我十分拒絕成長。 那應該是很累人的事情吧.

      「我們不要再聯絡了好嗎？」我第一次，在男人面前哭著這樣說。  以前都是我哭著說，「不要丟下我。」、「為什麼…」，或者乾脆哭著抓住對方的手死也不肯放。  我也不知道為什麼會突然對這人產生感情，我不瞭解他的過去、不知道他的未來，連他到底喜歡吃什麼、喝什麼，想什麼，我都弄不清楚。我的男友哲學一向是，事不關己不聽聞、一問搖頭三不知。不該我知道的，我不想知道…因為我沒有打算嫁給對方、那些正規女友才能管的事，我不需要知道。  可是，我終於還是傷害了我身邊的人。  話說出口之後，我才知道、原來我已經愛上他了呢。愛情，很盲目。對，就是這樣。悲傷的是，我已經失去撐下去的勇氣。如果下一秒我就死去…也許大家都不會再遺憾了。   Man.. i think of u tonight again. -___-''

      我只是突然認為﹐ 原來很多事情﹐ 不是我想說﹐ 就會有人想聽..  若是這樣的話﹐ 我寧願把自己的心封閉起來﹐ 唯有這樣﹐ 我才能避免說出你們任何人眼中所謂的廢話,我眼中所謂的真心話. 也唯有這樣﹐ 很多事情﹐ 我才能試著自己用心去體會, 讓自己逐漸成長.  很多事情 不是盡力了 就是最好的.. 就好像﹐ 我盡力地擠進你們的圓圈﹐ 但我發現﹐ 我永遠被隔離著..  像是完全不同的frequency.. 我們永遠只是擦肩而過的channel..  我只是盡力了. 但永遠是不夠的...

      I've spent most of my time sleeping throught the whole day. The first thing i did was answering Janet's phone and we talked for almost 40 minutes, i guess? Then we somehow ended the conversation because there was a sms coming in. ( She called to my handphone ) Ahah, Siew chien is still the top.. we talked for almost 2 hours ( my god ) 2nd , Bluewhale ( 1 hour ) 3rd, Janet ( 40 minutes non-stop ) and 4th, Danny ( he called over from n9 and the duration is about 20 minutes or a lil bit more ). Danny's ranking was once the first but after siew chien came back, whoa ! LoL~ girls usually talk much than guys do, isnt it?  Hmm, i'm looking forward to kee tzuen's reply from friendster. It's always fun.. fun to wait for one's reply ... i'm quite eager, and i dont know why? i guess i hafta train myself with patience one day.. else i'm really gonna get crazy because of my stupid character. Well, not to deny, i get nervous easily, at times, and this is a bad thing to do since i cant even handle myself, how am i suppose to handle things i am supposed to handle? LoL~  Something fun went on today. Pigzi, aloha, lico, sky , and some strangers (keigo, joeytee ).. a few of us went on yahoo messenger and had some voice chat. I was actually facing problems on how to use my mic, and i somehow got it right ! LoL~ it was fun ..pigzi's voice sounded "man" comparing to aloha's , lico is really good in singing but aloha teased her that she cant "tarik" when she sang the song ( forgot which ) ..duh, that stupid aloha never changed his habit ( teasin others ), and sky is very very friendly. Both lico and sky cant stop chatting when both of them are holding the mic.. LoL~ they call the 2 women, pasar malam -__-'' ( which is sooo true ! ) Aloha did something.. weird, i supposeD?  he asked weird questions and proved it himself, which is, are we able to hear one's voice from the phone if the mic is put next to it? the answer is YES. Everything wasnt right and sky can even sense it ! we cant seem to hear aloha's voice cause lico put the mic at the wrong place...( yeah, the talkin part ) and everyone was laughing.. She looks like a happy-go-lucky person to me, which makes my mood even betta , i would say ! But the bad thing would be.. since i'm using the older version of yahoo messenger, my ym kept on hang and i missed the aloha's voice part !! and it's just not fair ( acting like a mad cow.. ahahhaa )  I went to Siew chien's house. For the first time, i was being so punctual and i arrived earlier !  We first worked on the card i wanna make for him.. it didnt turn out that nice but i've done my best ( at least that's what i think ) Then she taught me alot of things i hafta do.. and i feel so "spirited" to do it.. i must do my best and not disappoint her , don wanna let myself down at d same time.. i cant bear the shame. She's helped me alot in everything.. MAybe i know i just needed a guiding friend, who's willing to teach me things. And I know i'm some type of person who is never keen in learning, lazy always... duh -___-''  Okay, i MUST study at all times... i lost to tht kim in some "fields" so i must win her in studies !!!!! ( i know this sentence looks stupid to anyone who's reading.. but who cares? )

      WL ﹐ 天知道我有多想見你. 多次打電話給你﹐單單為了聽你那磁性的聲音。 放下電話後﹐好久﹐我才能回神。 我好懷疑﹐電話的另一個尾端的你﹐是否認為我是屬于"不知羞恥傢伙"名單中之一. 我只是喜歡那分感覺. ___________________________________________________________ Things i can remember  1)the pillow scene, u laughed at me cause i was crapping about my pillow. my finger suddenly ached. 2) u say " in your dreams.." ( wheneve i see this word, i was thinkin of you ) 3) the msg u typed " who cares about sleep .. blah blah blah " that was when i started to learn from you. too bad we dont really keep in touch. 4) 18 june 2003 . u were at the club.. your pose was so cool ! leaning against the wall.. i will never forget bout that. i even sms-ed keson and told him about it. we talked for a while, only a while. i appreciate that though. 5) u loved to buy tissue in watsons .especially the cute ones. i think of you on kuching age group swimmin competition 2004 while i went to watsons. i missed u alot that day. i bought tissue that day too. 6) i can remember on year 2003, during swimming competition, u dont bother to get in the pool for warm up. it was a sunny afternoon and it was definitely very hot. u were reading your books. i like u since. 7) i kept most of all the sms-es u sent. guess that's why i don feel like changing a camera phone. ahah. nice fren.

      我想我快醉了. 想你的時候﹐我會不由自主地想喝有酒精的飲料﹐就好比啤酒或Wine之類. 想你的次數越高﹐醉酒的程度越高。 我終于明白為何自稱大人的男人喜歡碰酒了。 啤酒之所以苦﹐是因為它能reflect一個人的心情. 或是﹐醉醺醺的感覺才能隱隱約約地感覺到你的存在。 我竟是如此愚笨的認為.

      親愛的，我會愛你，直到你不愛我為止。 有沒有下一秒我不敢說，我看到的只是現在，就只在乎現在，你的過去，我不管，我的未來，你也能選擇不接手。 反正我曾習慣過一個人，找回感覺並不難。

      So, how do u think of tonight? I know u're quite sad. I'm wondering if calling kian cheng along to my party is a correct act .. .. but i know u can overcome ur sadness one day.   Let me share with you how i think of my birthday before i forget anything. i tend to foget things, always. Duh ! Early morning, since 12.01am.. i started to receive sms from friends like eric fong, li chun, tai min, connie, roderick,and a net fren nicknamed "shemtam^leikei" ( don simply think ar..he's a apek in his thirties.. not the one whom i wan to make a birthday card )   I was touched ..even though those sms doesnt really cost much, but they bring the best wishes. I do feel good, it's just that "feeling" which i always believed in. U'll definitely feel soooooo gam dong when ppl get up or stay awake at 12am and have that idea of sms-ing ...even though that sms costs only the most 20cents..argh.. donno how to express better in words ( i owes forget words i want to use -_- call me "chi dun" ) haiya, u know what i mean la.. hehe .. we so fren already, no need to explain too much, right?  I dont get much sleep this few days. I wonder why. When it's about time, i always get into the bed and start to dream.. but cant get into sleep ler, i always think up and down.. till i really cant tahan in bed, i'll just walk downstairs and watch tv or online.. writing my own diary. I've this own habit of writing a online diary since.. donno when. Just found out that i've got alot of things to express but lack of listeners lor. So , you are proven true. Very true. Keep things in heart. But dont worry.. i'll sure kacau and "fan" u with all my problems till u cannot tahan.. About your charges.. forget about it la.. we sooooooo fren already, no need talk about cash one..hehehehe. Hmm, perhaps one day, i'll let u see the diary of mine.. only if u are interested. It's okay for me.. i guess. Cause i know u "watch mouth like bottle" .. ﹕P  About the pizzahut part, it was fun. I never talked so fast and crap so much..The jokes might be dirty, but as long as everyone is happy..i'm happy :D But i think my wallet is going to cry cause i seldom use my own money ..today didnt get money from my dad cause i know they had already spend alot on the food.. so i better shut up and curi curi take my own money from my angpao >.  Well, late afternoon, my heart was filled with disappointment. I felt as if they all pakat to fool me cause everyone sms-ed me telling they are not going to turn up. The worst part would be they are not turning up and yet they didnt give me any further notice. That's bad, isnt it? I dont mind if they're not coming, but at least they hafta tell me earlier.. so that i can save more money from the food.. the food sucked my blood..But since everything passed, so let it be lor.  One surprise thing, Amie Pang. hahahaha.. she's really a funny girl.. also kiasu type..likes to bug the teacher for marks.. but very funny. Very "real" person.. not a hipocrit, unlike some others lor. I'm not really close with her.. But i'm surprised tat she phoned and drop by to give me that present. Feel like "dui bu qi" her.. shouldnt had tel her it's my birthday.. so that she can save more money.  At night, i can feel as if i'm crazy. I told my ah ma that all 6 boys are my boyfren ! ahah ! stupid act !  One more thing, thanks for sharing everything with me.. I'll strive hard for Spm this time. i'll try.  good night and enjoy your holiday in kuching ! dont be haunted by the memories, okay?   i'm not good in words, but i supposed u can understand me la. haiya ! reply your letter liao.. this time i crap too much la.. hahahhaa. i'm going to keep this email as part of my diary, so that i wouldnt need to re-write my diary lor. lazy hor?  Smile always. AhBit.  p/s : wei loong dint come ! actually i expected him to come .. cause my birthday is only the best excuse to meet him up.. i haven met him since year 2003 ! sigh. Take care.

      I haven been sleeping early during this holiday. It's not a nice feeling at all. I cant even get into my dreams ! I've got nothing to dream of ! Does this resembles that i've got no more hope in life? Dreams actually means something.. isnt it? Just chatted with Tin Cheng. He's actually a nice person with a kind heart. He loves giving advice and i bet he gives advice to anyone who needs it. Argh. I promised him to get 9A1.. but let's forget about the A1.. as long as it's A.. i'm satisfied. Tomorrow ownwards, i'll strive hard for my target.  My one and only Target..and that's SPM. Like Siew Chien has always said, try your best. I know, and i'll try. Seriously, this time.

      Quote,  "我害怕失去你，而你不以為然。  其實，我很畏懼講電話時我們之間會突然安靜，好像你已經不在線的那端，連呼吸聲都不存在。因為我們總是找不出話告訴彼此吧。你不會對我坦白，而我不想一直拿自己的瑣事煩你。我們親暱實際上卻陌生的很。  你無法再像以前一樣的，在網上跟我吵鬧嘻笑，這是我換來的代價吧，可是親愛的，我好懷念我們曾經有過的時間，那時候我不是你的誰，但你離我比較近，我看的見你，每天，在幾乎相同的時間。  如果有天我失去了再打電話給你的勇氣，你也會忘記我吧。  好想告訴你，我們可不可以都不要分開，因為我無法想像沒有你的日子，既使現在的我如此寂寞不安。但我不會這樣要求你，因為我知道我並不是你的唯一。沒有誰能保證永遠，只要你現在對我還有一絲感覺，我就不會離開。  讓我陪著你吧，我會很乖很乖的.  親愛的，請記得你答應了我，如果有一天你對我沒了感覺，要親口告訴我。別經過旁人別使用文字，要自己來到我面前，親口說你不再喜歡我。讓我保留最後的自尊。至於我對你的感情，我會努力將它收好，我不會吵鬧，我會放手讓你自由。這是我愛你的方式。 有一種愛，是不屬於我的。但我們之間還在等待你。你會牽我的手嗎？有了你，我便不再需要尋找星星。  我是真的喜歡你。"  I've no idea how to express myself through words, cause it just one hard thing to do on this world. Thanks to strangers, they're able to express my feelings using their magnificent words. Well, not to deny, i am thinking of you at this very moment.

      Quote, "那時候我總是在等待著跟你交談的機會，既使是只有短短兩三句無關痛癢的話，剩餘的一天也會突然愉快明亮了起來。你並不知道，你對一個從未見過面的人有著這樣的影響力，你也不知道那個下午我收到你寄來的書的時候，在美術館旁的大街上，一路哼著歌跳舞回家。  或許你不能了解那樣的心情，可是我的確總為你不經意的幾個字，自以為是的跟著你快樂悲傷著。  其實我什麼都不知道吧。"  Dear dieung, That was exactly how i felt when i first know u in year 2002. That's the best gift i've got for the rest of my life. Thanks for befriending a worthless person like i am.

      我記得我對你說過 感覺太不可靠了﹐ 因為它會隨著時間的流逝﹐而漸漸不見的。 你沉思一會兒﹐ 然後回答道 "我的感覺是不會不見的."  是這樣麼..? 我怎麼不如此認為.. 如果是的話﹐ 你為什么顯得如此孤單﹑寂寞.  感覺﹐ 是否會因為離別﹐而越來越深. 如果是這樣的話﹐ 我希望 我們永遠不聯絡..

      我很清楚的知道﹐之前﹐之前的之前﹐之前的之前的之前等﹐都是假象。 那通電話﹐讓我覺得好恐怖。 你的聲音﹐突然讓我覺得害怕。 真的好害怕。 雖然如此﹐我依然試著用鎮定的語氣跟你聊天﹐哪怕是10秒也好。 來電顯示時﹐我有點猶豫不決﹐但始終接了。 天意弄人﹐手機竟然沒電了。 我知道﹐除了被你討厭之外﹐真的沒有其他感覺了。 至少目前沒有。

      While walking down from the 3-steps-stairs, i slipped and fell. I'm just unlucky anyway, the old lady just mopped the floor and i just walked past that place, and slipped. Darn, i've got a scar on my left hand ( humerus , lol learn too much bio ) and have a big bruise on my back. Never felt soo unlucky before, especially when i've got alot fatter these days, i cant deny that it hurts alot. i was about to cry but i didnt. I only act cute to the kids and my sis, telling them how hurt it is. Hehe!  Studied only a liltle today. I aint satisfied with the old guy who teached my driving. He's not even serious at all. Duh, forget about it.  Let's talk about my feelings today in school. It's okay, i just dont like that girl, and i've no reasons why. I wont let myself lose to her anymore. Let's wait and see. It's right to say that i'm one type of person who's very obsessive ( 佔有慾 ? ) , and i dont like the feeling when Miss C is wif HeR. She seemed like she's another different person, more like a stranger. Well, i hate it when i have that kinda feeling. It's like u cant trust anyone else in this world and u can only work on yourself on anything, being mean to anyone and let others hate you.   I'm crapping again. Anyway, good night...  p/s : left 2 months, i'm going to lose weight for goodness sake.

      Dang, again. I'm addicted to games. Well, i cant deny that i can addict to anything easily. i promised myself to study yet i didnt do anything about it. I told myself to go at least the gym to get rid the circles of fat around my waist but once i'm at the club, i forgot everything and hardly feel like doing any workout. Darnit. how can i achieve my goal then? what about the weight? studies? Shit. i'm not well-disciplined anyway.  Ate pizza today. No, not only pizza. i had lots of food. Went out of control and got a bulging stomach.  &nbsp;

      Dang. i can never remember what i want to write about when it comes to writing diary online.I always have alot of things to say at different moments, but i never have d habit of jotting these ideas down, on a notebook or even on a piece of paper. Argh, am a lil stuck. what the heck. -.- Let's start wif my day. Supposed to write PiescesGuy a letter today, but i dont really haf d mood to sit down and write something. I can only be serious when ppl around me are really serious or realy NOT serious.  Went to d library. Drove car today. 2nd drive. it was nice, kinda nervous though. Feel like tellin everybody that i can actually drive a car now, but i dont think it's nice to tell everyone, they'll feel like i'm "showing off" of which i am not. I only wanted to express my feelings , for the sake of sharing. I almost finished biology chapter 2 !!! i must hurry.. must not let that GIRL win me this time ! let's see ! Made some cookies. The kitchen was in a mess though.&nbsp; My wrong. But that's something normal, ppl like me never get things straight, hehe!!! Time for bed though. Will try to jot down everything from now on. Wanna make my life more worthy. Am still trying.  &nbsp; p/s : i got fatter by 1-2kg .. Eeww~ i ate alot ! -.- &nbsp;

      I've no idea why i seemed to call myself stupid these days. eg. i felt asleep when i studied for bio, then coach chung woke me up. The moment i wake up, i slapped my face ( 輕輕d ) and call myself stupid or useless. Sometimes i feel that i cant really achieve my target. Or i dont seem to have a target of my own? 8As. I never seemed to work hard for it though, not trying my best but am still trying. Got fatter. CAnt resist good food. Dang.  I've got a strange feelin that laobah will be leaving irc. I dont want that to happen. How i wished i can tell her how much i liked her as a fren or even a closer relationship, lao ba. I cant deny that i rely on her as much as lao bu, i just liked her.she's someone who keeps things to herself, only to herself. I know and i admit that i am a burden to her, eventho i liked her that much ( and i dont think she can sense it ) but i dont think she'll like me in another way. How i wished i can tell her how important she is to me. just like lao bu. Duh. I'm only making things worst. How i wished she and lao bu can always be at my side. Well, i know it's a selfish thought and that's quite impossible.   Tired. Here goes my day, wasted online.

Should have change -_-''   My target of the week finish 2 bab bio and 2 bab Add maths. Start reaading sejarah for 1 bab

      嗯，很意外，這裡給我一些靈感。從來沒有想到，我會再回到這裡，用完全不同的心境。很努力去試著改過，曾經錯的，挽回不了，就讓它都過去。我想，很多事，我不必解釋，你們會體會到，懂的就會懂。

      我突然發覺﹐原來自己是可以隨時結束自己生命的一個人。每當受到挫折時﹐我都會有類似荒謬的想法。我想把很多人視為珍貴的生命﹐了了的畫上句點。 (R:210.17.47.3)  --> 219.95.222.51 -- 2004-06-06 02:14:26 -- Homepage： urlLink  http://海洋-屬于星星的墳墓.com
