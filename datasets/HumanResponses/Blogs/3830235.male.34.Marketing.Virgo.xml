       After I heard John Reese continually mentioning the importance of ad tracking, (in John's Traffic Secrets course), I realized that my tracking which I had in place so far, sucks. That's why I got myself a new script with all the sophisticated bells and whistles an Internet marketer needs. It has a lot of great features like sales tracking AND split testing. Testing is that important and my old script (DynaTracker) did not allow me to do this. Moreover, I can now even track my sales from any ads. Of course, only for websites I have full control over. So tracking of sales for any affiliate programs will not work. At least, as far as I know about that.  The best part about this script is that it is very easy to install. With a lot of CGI programs, I am getting in trouble during the installation process at one point or the other but not with this one. You are guided through a step by step setup process which includes even some screenshots from the WS_FTP software so you can see how it needs to be done. This has been the easiest CGI installation I have done so far (I have done around 7 or 8). When you get clicks to your URLs, you can even see graphical representations of the statistics and it will calculate your ROI. Sales tracking is done by means of adding an image tag to your salesletter and your thankyou page. I haven't seen this in action, though, as it is just about 30 minutes ago that I did the installation. But I am pretty sure it will work great as this tracking software is recommended by a lot of Internet marketers including John Reese.   urlLink  Click here if you want to see this tracking script in action (goes to the ProAnalyzer page)

       John Reese is going to release his Traffic Secrets Course on Tuesday, Aug. 17. The whole Internet marketing world is excited about that and it is already creating a buzz... Why? Because he's a guy who is doing business online for more than 10 years already and has tested almost everything online. He knows what works to sell huge amounts of products - he has personally sold products worth millions of dollars. Not only does he reveal for the first time HOW he does it, he SHOWS you how to achieve these results. I am one of the first people who has already received his Traffic Secrets package and I must tell you: THIS ROCKS!  It has 7 DVDs which show John at his recent sold out Internet marketing seminar ($4500/seat!!) where marketing legends like Gary Halbert attended. Gary said, it was the best seminar he has ever visited. Personally, I was impressed by the search engine DVD even though "I thought, I knew it all". But even though John did not reveal the secrets himself but some of his seminar attendants, I can tell you that it reveals dynamite stuff. e.g. They tell you how to get your site listed within 48 hours of putting it up. Talk about a big timesaver. But the best thing is that he gives you step by step directions for getting lots of traffic to your site every time you roll out a new product. You can see everything in the DVDs but he also has included some nice coloured handouts where you can see exactly what to do and in which order. I also liked the DVD about tracking a lot and it gave me directions how I can improve my own tracking.  He has another 6 CD-ROMs where he takes you by the hand in a series of screencam videos. These videos are divided into different chapters and everything is made very easy to follow. The videos are played automatically one after the other. Of course, you know Pay-Per-Click search engines. Probably you also know how difficult it can be if you are not getting enough clickthroughs for your campaigns. Or worse, you get too many clicks but they don't convert which can be very costly. John shows you exactly what to do in these situations. And to top it all, he has included two workbooks which let you read everything from the DVDs so it is easier to follow and so you can mark important details in it with a textmarker. Then you just need to put the highlighted sections into action. And in a third workbook, you can track your progress and enter the exact traffic numbers. All in all, I highly recommend this course and it will be a great investment if you don't have enough traffic for your site or if it doesn't convert.  These secrets are not for "cheapskates", though.  Only if you are serious and dedicated to your online business will John let you have his collection of proven and tested website traffic secrets.   urlLink CLICK HERE TO BE PUT ON JOHN'S PRE-LAUNCH LIST   - THE FIRST CUSTOMERS WILL GET AN ADDITIONAL BONUS WORTH $500 FROM JOHN - EVEN MORE VIDEOS WHICH ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE REGULAR PACKAGE. ONLY IF YOU ORDER WITHIN THE FIRST 17 HOURS, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET IT -

       Today, I received a refund request for my AffiliateTurbo software (it submits affiliate programs to the affiliate program directories). Nothing special about it, you would say, but the problem with it was that my customer mentioned reasons WHY he wanted the refund. And these were complete nonsense. He said, the software would not submit fast enough to the directories. As an explanation: My software uses a built-in browser and of course, this browser can only be as fast as the Internet connection of the user. The other reason he mentioned was that it had some affiliate directories included which were not working.  But exactly for this reason, the software has built-in functions to remove those non-working directories. And new directories can also be added manually. I have taken hours upon hours to find new directories today and I have created an updated file for the directories which just needs to be downloaded. I told him that I would send him the updated file which adds even 5 additional directories to the software (it was 43 and now it is 48). And, you guessed it already: He still wanted a refund, even though none of the reasons he mentioned were existent anymore. I told him that I have the impression that he's ripping me off.  Of course, no one likes to hear something like that. But what would you have thought or done in such a situation....?

       One of the first comments about new products I want to make is about Mike Mograbi's 378 Internet marketing predictions. It took me quite long to get through all of these pages but it was really worth it. I have found so many new ideas that am now more convinced than ever that Internet marketing still is the correct "niche" for me. Although everybody and their grandpa says to search for new niches. This might be true for those who publish nothing but rehashed materials or who are trying their luck with resale right products only.  In fact, if you have good ideas and know how to put them into practice, even a very competetive arena like Internet marketing offers enough possibilities to make money. In his book, Mike spots the latest trends and predicts how they will develop in the next few years. One example: He's mentioning search engines which will be able to personalize the users input. So if a golfer does a search for "tiger", the search engine will know that the golfer professional Tiger Woods is meant and not the animal.  His book is mainly responsible that I started blogging and that I am adding RSS feeds to my websites.        urlLink  Read more about it here

       I must say it took me quite a while to figure out how this blogging-stuff works. But fortunately, there are some manuals available which explain what do. The next step after publishing my first marketing thoughts locally on blogger.com will be to show them on my new site: detlevreimer.com . It's a site I have registered especially for testing these "new" technologies like blogging and using RSS feeds.
