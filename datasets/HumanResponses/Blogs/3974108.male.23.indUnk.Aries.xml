      Brett Bretterson, a.k.a. Agent Lucky 13, noted to himself that no one was watching him as he started toward the staircase.  He was in a crowded building, but sometimes a crowd is the best place to hide.  That is of course why he and those like him often chose to wear office type dress suits.  No one sees a man walking around wearing a black suit in a building full of men wearing black suits.  Also it provides plenty of places to hide things on your person.  As he starts to reach for the door handle his shoe catches on the edge of the rug and he falls face first into the door.  Everyone turns to look at him.  He stands up smiling, saying he's fine as he waves them away and bleeds from the nose.  He pretends to be wiping himself off while he waits for everyone's attention to turn elsewhere.  Once he figures they've all returned to whatever they were doing before he turns and non-chalantly opens the door and enters the staircase.  He closes the door behind him and begins climbing the stairs to the roof.  "Why is it that I always have to fire from roofs of buildings?  That always means you have to use the s-", he trips and jams his knee on a stair,"-tairs, gah, that hurt."  He continues to limp up the stairs till he finally reaches the top and exits onto the roof.  As he opens the door his coat sleeve gets caught on the handle without him noticing.  He tries to continue, but gets jerked back to the door and he jams his finger on the door.  He uncatches his sleeve and roughly straightens his suit coat, causing the barrel of his rifle to slip out of his back and land on the roof with a clang.  He picks it up and goes behind the stairwell and begins removing the rest of the rifle parts from his coat.  In about 3 minutes he has a fully assembled sniper rifle.  He sneaks over to his chosen perch as he finishes screwing on the scope.  He aims his sniper rifle at the art gallery window where he knows he will see his target in exactly 1 minute 15 seconds.  He takes aim and waits.  Right on cue the corrupt corporate kingpin walks into the window.  He pulls the trigger once and immediately backs up and hides behind the roofs ledging and starts dismantling his rifle and listens to the screaming in the distance that always accompanies a successful mission.  He notices as he unscrews his scope that it was a little tweaked, but he knew from the screaming that it couldn't have been off enough to mess up his mission.  As he leaves the building minutes later he sees a crowd of people.  He catches their words as he waves for a taxi: "what could possess someone to do something like that?"  "why? I don't understand."  His face goes pale as he hears, "why would someone shoot the statue of David?"

      Okay, I'm a very religious person, but I don't really want to get into religious discussions online.  All I'm saying in this post is that Atheism is stupid.  Why?  Because it makes life not worth living.  If Atheism is true then there is no purpose to life.  Life is simply a random occurence.  Also if Atheism is true then there is no afterlife.  Now many people like this idea because it means there are no permanent consequences for them.  No matter what they're going to die and that's the end of it.  This means there's nothing stopping them from doing whatever they feel like.  So it's appealing, but I would hate to believe that there's nothing after this life.  I keep myself under control in many ways that many do whatever they want.  Many would say I'm missing out on all the good things in life, but from what I've seen and experienced I'm getting all the good things in life, and they're missing out on lots of it.  I may be missing out on a lot of things, but I wouldn't dream of classifying any of those as good.  Most of them I wouldn't even classify as fun.  And in the long run (even if you only look at the next year or two) most of those things are more trouble than anything else.  I would hate believing there was nothing after this life.  I love my life and believe that everything good in it will continue after this life.  It would suck to believe that this was it.  The main reason Atheism is stupid though is that if Atheism is true it doesn't matter what you believe your going to die and that's the end.  If Atheism isn't true then it does matter what you believe and what you do.  Almost regardless of which religion is true believing in Atheism and acting accordingly will mean that you're in trouble after this life.  In saying this I would like to point out that I believe that most people who proclaim themselves to be Atheist don't actually act accordingly and I think that deep down they do believe in something after this life.  Religion is part of the human experience, whether or not you choose to embrace it it is part of you.

      One of my favorite TV shows was cancelled before I ever saw it.   Invader Zim  is comic genius, but I think it was too much for Nickelodeon to handle.  I've never really been a big fan of TV in general, but during spring semester I was tutoring a kid and he started telling me about Invader Zim.  He had a few copies of episodes on his computer and let me watch them.  Within a months time I had downloaded high quality copies of every episode available on the internet and had bought the DVD, and I'm looking forward to the second DVD.  Why is it that awesome shows like that get cancelled after only a couple seasons?   WHY?!!   This isn't true for everything of course.  The Simpsons has been running forever.  I personally am not super fond of the Simpsons, but it does have it's good points.  Look at some of the other great ones though:    Animaniacs  The Tick  Eek the Cat  Darkwing Duck  Dilbert    What's up with that?  They're some of the best cartoons TV has ever seen and none of them lasted more than a few seasons.  We need to have our cartoon companies rethink their policies.  I know Warner Bros. and Disney have a standard setup where they come out with new cartoons every couple years and cancel the old ones.  Why can't they keep them going?  It's not that they run out of material, Simpsons proves that.  Zim was perhaps cancelled in part due to some of its creepier aspects, such as the entire  Dark Harvest  episode, but there is no reason for Eek to have been cancelled.  And Zim was so popular when it was cancelled that Nick brought it back for a season because of all the petitions they received.  If you haven't seen Zim I highly recommend it.  You can download them in high quality avi format using bittorrent from  urlLink here .  Start with  The Nightmare Begins  just because it explains what's going on in the rest of them.  Also watch  Tak the Hideous New Girl  before you watch  The Most Horrible Christmas Ever  just because that's one of the only things where it's obvious which came first.  Be sure to watch  The Wettening  as well.  It's one of my favorites and is the one that got me hooked.  I suggest buying the DVD as well just because it's better quality and enough people buying it should let them know they need to do more.  They're planning on a 2nd one.  There are some episodes that were never aired in the US and can't be found on the Internet.  If they're not on the 2nd one I think I'll be searching for petitions to sign again.  Well, I'm sick of writing for now.  Watch Zim!

      Welcome to Accident Prone Assassin, don't ask me where I came up with the name.&nbsp; It just seemed to fit.&nbsp; This is where I'll rant &amp; rave about whatever I feel like.&nbsp; Afterall that's what my friend the tribblehunter does over at  urlLink Warped Core .  This is my first blog, though not my first website.  I wanted a place where I could rant about whatever I felt like and not have to pay for it.  My other websites are done with particular purposes in mind and I get paid to take care of them.  This one's for my own enjoyment, and mayhaps yours as well.
