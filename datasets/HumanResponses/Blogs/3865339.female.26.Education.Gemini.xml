            This article was interesting in that it discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the Internet.  I agree with a lot of what was said in the article about the use of the internet, the influeces it has on children, and the responsibilities of the schools to ensure students safe use of the internet.  It was not surprising to know how children use the internet, but it was surprising to read that some think the internet is frightening.  The reasons given for that fear would make any person weary of using the internet for anything.  Children use the internet for games, e-mail, instant meassaging, and to find music.  Students are unaware of how to really use the internet to gather information for use in the classroom.  It is the responsibility of schools and parents, especially, to teach children how to use the internet responsibly and safely.         It is important for educators to be aware of what knowledge of the internet children bring into the classroom.  The article influences my views of technology in the classroom by increasing my awareness of how important it is for schools to include technology in the curriculum.  It also made me aware of the steps educators need to take to form and enforce the neccessary policies to ensure correct use of the internet inside and outside of the classroom.  I think that the article reinforces my views on how technology is important enough to include in the curriculum due to society becoming more technology-based.

            My experiences with technology began when I was in high school.  Being a student in a science, mathematics, and technology academy afforded me the opportunity to gain experiences with computers and their many applications.  As a student, I attended classes that required skills in computer applications, such as word processing, spreadsheets, and databases, which are the basics to me.  Also, being a part of advanced mathematics and science courses, I had experiences with other technology, such as graphing calculators.  Elective courses also provided experiences with technology to apply in business technology and journalism.  Since then, I have always used technology.  In college, I was first introduced to power point and gained more experience with using the Internet.  As an education major, I was required to take a course in technology and develop a very simple portfolio, but I was not informed on how what I learned would be useful to me in the classroom.  But I believe, even at that time, many were not aware of the role technology would play in the classroom today.  Even when I began using technology, I never consider what influence and importance it would have in my profession.  I have always approached technology with a positive attitude, ready and willing to try new things, wondering what more could be added to my existing knowledge base.  The further I proceed in my profession, I have found the use of technology in the classroom has increased and become more important.  	As an educator, I have learned that technology includes more than computers.  I believe that technology includes anything used in the classroom that is not basic instructional materials.  Technology includes items such as an overhead, a television, a videocassette recorder, even manipulatives.  Most teachers use these items in their classrooms, but very few make use of computers and their applications.  I believe that computers play an extremely important role in classrooms today.  As our society advances and becomes more technological based, it is necessary for education to make the same advances.  Society has made it so most children are exposed to some sort of technology everyday and most have become more adept to using computers, especially the Internet.  But I think that it is the responsibility of the schools to help children become more adept to using computer applications.  Students need basic and/or advance computer skills in order to succeed in school and in our society.  Students need to know how use programs such as word processing or spreadsheets and apply that knowledge to any subject area.  I like to try to use computers in the classroom, but it can be difficult to provide students with that opportunity because they need exposure and a chance to do trial and error.  The more exposure and the chance to experiment with different computer programs that students have, I believe they gain a better understanding and a more positive attitude towards technology.  But using computers for instructional purposes can be increasingly difficult when the resources are not available.  I have been somewhat fortunate to be at a school that has a computer lab, 15 laptops, and the use of two computers in my classroom.  Although my school has these small advantages, which is more than other schools, problems arise with scheduling time.  Students need adequate time for exposure and experience with different computer applications, but that can be difficult. 	Computers have become and will continue to become a very important part of K-12 education.  Reason being, society has become more advanced, therefore students need the skills to function in a world that practically revolves around technology.  It is the responsibility of K-12 educators to prepare children for success in their future, no matter the educational or professional route they choose.  It is no longer enough to teach students how to read and write and do basic mathematics.  Students need experience and exposure with computers and their applications to use in almost every profession that exists today and that will exist.

      I think that the main point of this article was to provide positive reasoning for including computers in the elementary school classroom.  The article discussed how upper-elementary students were using computers in their classrooms.  Of course it toucher on the skepticism that some educators have about integrating computer use in the curriculum.  It talked about how students used the computers to write short stories, prepare web pages and power point presentations, and use a photo application program.  For example, it was stated that the use of word processing for writing short stories benefited students that had difficulty with writing.  There were teachers that were skeptical about using computers in the classroom, arguing that they had no use for them and that students were not ready for the computer applications.  But according to the article, students were enthusiastic, very helpful, and knowledgable about using the computers.  Teahcers seemed at first apprehensive because they did not want the computers to replace actual teaching in the classroom but later realized that computers are a resource, not a replacement.  This article was interesting because it talked about how educators are divided on the issue of integrating computers in the curriculum.  Being that I have dealt with computers so much, I feel they are important to use but should not take the place of what is taught in the classroom.  The author discussed how the power point presentations that the students prepared were flashy and he was not very impressed.  In  that instance, I agree that the presentations had no true educational basis except to teach the students how to use power point.  It would have been more beneficial to have the students prepare presentations based on a particular subject area.  That, I believe, is how computers should be used in the classroom.

      The main point of this article discussed the importance of a changing vocational curriculum that allowed high school students to participate in technological classes to prepare them for the world of work. The vocational program at some high schools are beginning to include technology courses along with the traditional vocational courses, such as autoshop, construction or welding. The article discussed how changing the vocational program decreased some of the negativity that it received. The technological courses were added to the program due to the predicted increases in the field of technology and the shift of this country from "industrial" to "technological". The added courses are supported by huge computer hardware and software companies that need people with more experience in technology. The companies provide the hardware, software, training, and certification for students. Also, adding the classes to the vocational program has bridged the gap between it and academic programs because all kinds of students participate in the classes. There are issues with the program, such as company benefits and teacher quality. There is a concern about what the companies are benefiting from supporting these classes but they do not recieve any money, just well-trained people ready for the workforce.  Teacher quality is an issue because students need to receive adequate instruction on the "why" of technology, not just memorization of the skills.  I think that providing those classes for students is as important as any other vocational class.  Some students are not ready or do not want to partake of a more adademic track and need to be provided with other options.  Not to say that academics are not important, but some are just not interested and need to shown othe options that may interest them.  The additional classes also provide opportunity for true application, which is lacking in traditional academics, and training for future careers.
