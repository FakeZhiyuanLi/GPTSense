      (sorry, this one's going to be serious, instead of funny)  I know.  At least, now I do.  One of the things I’ve seen over the past couple years is the odd infatuation that some freshmen have with juniors, seniors, and even sophmores.  It’s like, if the upperclassman pays attention to them, they’re hooked.  And that’s what I couldn’t figure out.  Even if the senior was a complete idiot, and the freshman was a total ditz, at least around him, they still got together.  Why?  I couldn’t figure it out.  But now I know.  I know, because it happened to me.  It has to do, as most things do, with power.  It’s addicting.  It’s invigorating.  And it comes in many ways, one of the purest being power over another person.  That’s what it is.  What happened between “Joe” and “May”, the senior and the freshman in that order,  was last year, and I was essentially a spectator, because May is one of my better friends (you know who you are, May).  She was thrilled, captivated even, about the fact that anyone would like her.  Especially a senior like Joe.  And you know what they say, love is blind.  At least this kind of love.  So the slightest bit of attention Joe paid to May, she loved it.  And the thing is, she loved it so much she became his slave, almost.  He could’ve asked her to do anything and she’d just be enthralled by his voice.  In her eyes, his faults had disappeared and his merits were inflated.  The way high school works, to freshmen, people of a higher grade level are elevated to almost a god-like status.  Joe was invincible and perfect in May’s eyes.  Actually, that much I got last year.  What I didn’t understand is why Joe liked May at all.  But again, now I know.  He got a near-complete power over her.  It’s like she was hypnotized; she’d do anything for him.  And let me tell you, that power is more addictive than drugs, than alcohol, than anything.  It’s because with the other ones, it’s your body.  Physically, you can’t do without it.  But with this?  It’s mental.  You can live without it.  But the biggest thing is, you don’t even notice it.  It just kind of seeps into you and makes you feel good.  It’s the reason that certain seniors that I know are basically playing the freshmen girls.  Okay, take one of them, for example.  After school?  He’s surrounded by a cadre of girls, following him everywhere and hanging on to his every word.  It’s really kind of disgusting.  But then again, if it’s you, you don’t notice it.  Unless…you’re looking out for it.  This is how you know.  It’s probably someone younger than you, and they look like they just can’t get enough of you.  That’s how I knew, when a couple months ago, I was waiting for my ride, and a bunch of freshmen girls that I knew were waiting there too.  They can’t talk to you without giggling and acting like complete morons, really.  What happened that finally got me was probably because I wasn’t ready for it.  Didn’t really see what I was doing until it was kind of late.  And then I really couldn’t do anything about it; it’s complicated, but for privacy’s sake, no details.  And you know what happens if you get caught?  It’s going to hurt yourself, whoever’s addicted to you, and in my case, someone else too.  That last one’s the worst part.  When you’re good enough friends that you’d do anything for her because she’s the nicest person you know, and then you hurt her like that…it makes you feel like crap.  As you can probably tell, that happened to me too.  You know who you are…I am so, so sorry.  Truth be told, I’d rather have sat with you anyways.  But back to May and Joe.  They broke up at the end of last year, when Joe graduated and went to college.  And then something interesting happened: when we started school again in August, May had really matured.  She got burned, and she knows why, too.  I’ve got to commend her for that, even though I thought she was an incurable ditz a year ago.  I need to talk about something else, too.  It’s high school dating in general.  My friend Joy recently posted her (and others’) views on dating in high school; I pretty much agree.  It really doesn’t work.  You think you’re in love, everyone else’s doing it, and the biggest and stupidest reason of all, it’s a status symbol.  Somehow, it’s “cool” to be dating; it automatically kicks you up a notch on that screwed up heirarchy that some people at school live by.  Don’t get me wrong, if it’s “true love” or something, go for it.  But…how do you know?  Do you  love  the person, or just like them?  I’d say that 99% of the time it’s the latter.  I’m sure many of you are thinking: But ( insert name here ) and ( also here ) are dating and they’re getting along fine!  No, seriously.  Getting along fine?  Those words, used in conjunction with dating, just don’t work.  At least in high school, everyone wants different things.  Girls want romance and kisses, guys (usually) just want the girl.  As Joy said, it’s really kind of sad when people celebrate their one  month  anniversary.  The worst is when you start dating a close friend.  Why ruin a perfectly good friendship by going out?  Really, though, most relationships don’t work out, and even if they do, almost none make it though their first year in college, if not the first few months.  Things change when you go to college; people change.  What’s not going to change is the close friendships that you have, but your girlfriend or boyfriend?  It’s going to be different, and chances are you’re not going to like it.  You’re going to feel tied down in college if you’re dating someone hundreds of miles away.  However, when you’ve got a close, close friend that you can tell  anything  to anywhere in the world, you feel secure, like you’ve got support with you.  Some people want “love” in high school.  Me?  I  know  now.  I’d rather have friendship.

      My mom is a high school math teacher.  Now, quite aside from all the hilarity that that implies, there is a very serious issue that we should address.  That is, the growing, and shrinking, of clothes. So anyways, we were talking the other day about the steadily increasing amount of fabric that is the minimum for any guy to be “cool”.  These days, many guys at my school and at my mom’s school wear anywhere from two to eighteen pairs of pants.  And then on top of that they’ve got about three layers, topped by the inevitable jersey.  Oddly enough, their underwear manages to make itself seen through all this; God only knows how that works. When my mom has to separate people for talking or something, many times she has to stifle her laughter as these guys with four or five pairs of pants have to untangle themselves from their desks and kind of waddle across the room, taking huge, deliberate steps to avoid tripping themselves with their own pants. This is a disturbing trend toward greater amounts of fabric for several reasons.  Firstly, where is this extra cloth coming from?  The answer, of course, is from the girls’ clothes.  The newly discovered  Law of Inversely Proportional Gender-Separated Clothing  states that:   If some guy has a lot of clothes on, then somehow, somewhere, there is a girl with an equal and  opposite  amount of clothes on.  The same thing works the other way around too.   The LoIPGSC, as it is popularly known among the intelligentsia, can be proved by taking a look at around twenty to thirty years ago, when it was “cool” for guys to wear near skin-tight clothing.  What did girls wear then?  Frilly stuff!   More fabric!   Therein we have the increasing trend of girls toward skimpier and tighter clothing.  This raises the interesting question of: is the “in” thing to be skinnier because clothes are tighter, or are clothes tighter because it’s “in” to be skinnier.  However this works, it is a vicious cycle, which can only culminate in girls not being able to be seen altogether. Of course, this  will  solve the world’s food crisis, because these new, ultra-thin girls would only consume about .5 mL of pureed, non-fat, low-carb, low-calorie cardboard.  The other reason that the implementation of the LoIPGSC is disturbing is, of course, new ways of cutting class.  Because of guys wearing more and more clothing, eventually they will just look like huge piles of fabric (designer fabric, naturally).  The time will come when someone can just sneak into class, deposit an immense pile of clothes on his desk, and sneak back out.  No one will be the wiser! Girls, of course, won’t be able to be seen anyways, so they can just plant a voice-activated tape recorder underneath their chair, to say “Here!” when the teacher calls roll.  Now, with no one in their classes at all, teachers won’t report to school, so there will just be huge empty schools with only the principal sitting at her desk, creating policy and making sure that her school looks good.  It is this last one that makes it possible for no one to notice the lack of students at school, because the principal will make sure that her school stays at state-mandated levels, even if she has to take all 2500 or so standardized tests herself.

      A recent CNN.com report talked about a study entitled “Eat Less, Live Longer.”  These seem to pop up everywhere, you know?  “Exercise More, Live Longer”, or “Eat More Calories, Become More Caloric”, or perhaps “Eat More, Become Bigger”.  In any case, the study was on a group of mice that apparently hung around with an even age distribution until researchers picked them up for tests.  The interesting part was that, quote: “Even older mice on restricted diets fare better in research.”  According to Dr. Spindler, a 19-month-old mouse is equivalent to a 60 or 65-year-old human.  This is roughly one mouse week per human year, and raises some important questions like:  1. Do mice have 40-week birthday parties with gag cards that say things like “It’s your birthday, so I wish you luck” on the outside, and then on the inside say “You’re 40 (weeks).  You’re going to need it”?  2. Do old mice reminisce about when they were little, and they had to steal cheese by hand, and didn’t get any of “them fancy trap-snappin’ contraptions” that young mice are so completely corrupted by nowadays?  I think these are questions that need to be thought about by American citizens, simply because they kill so many less brain cells than some current music which seems to consist of one note played repeatedly on a torched cat strung on a guitar.  At the end, the article, of course, claims that aging may eventually be slowed down by taking a pill.  I think all articles about medical advances say that nowadays.  Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got to go help my mice put on their dentures.

      It is a law in Singapore that: "If you are convicted of littering three times, you will have to clean the streets on Sundays with a bib on saying, 'I am a litterer.' This will then be broadcasted on the local news."  The city of Gueleph, Ontario "is classified as a no-pee zone."  In Toronto, Ontario, "you can't drag a dead horse down Yonge Street on a Sunday."  "Residents are not allowed to have an Internet connection faster than 56k" in Uxbridge, Ontario.  In England "it is illegal to be drunk on Licensed Premises (in a pub or bar)", "any person found breaking a boiled egg at the sharp end will be sentenced to 24 hours in the village stocks", and of course "it is legal for a male to urinate in public, as long it is on the rear wheel of his motor vehicle and his right hand is on the vehicle."  Being more specific, in the city of Chester, "you can only shoot a Welsh person with a bow and arrow inside the city walls and after midnight", and in York, "excluding Sundays, it is perfectly legal to shoot a Scotsman with a bow and arrow." Sounds kinda violent.  In Liverpool, "it is illegal for a woman to be topless in public except as a clerk in a tropical fish store."  Denmark: "One may not be charged for food at an inn unless that person, by his or her own opinion, is 'full'."  In South Dakota, "no horses are allowed into Fountain Inn unless they are wearing pants" and "it is illegal to lie down and fall asleep in a cheese factory."  Vermont law once said that "it is illegal to tie a giraffe to a telephone pole."  In the same token, in Florida "if an elephant is left tied to a parking meter, the parking fee has to be paid just as it would for a vehicle."  Also in Florida, the state constitution protects the rights of "freedom of speech, a trial by jury, and pregnant pigs to not be confined in cages" and "a women can be fined (only after death), for being electrocuted in a bath-tub because of using self-beautification utensils."  Louisiana: "It is illegal to rob a bank and then shoot at the bank teller with a water pistol."  Okay, that's all for today.  Go to www.dumblaws.com for more...well...dumb laws.

      In the University of Texas, San Antonio I found a stone table outdoors with this message scrawled on it:  - “The one you love and the one who loves you are never, ever the same person.”  Now, I was considering writing a serious column regarding the truth and falseness of this statement, and I would have too, had it not been followed by another statement, in different ink:  - “What if you love yourself?”  Then there was:  - “Narcissist?”  And:  - “Good f***ing point.”  Needless to say, the idea of writing any sort of serious work concerning this flew out the window.  And it really is a good point.

       10 ways to know if you’re a nerd:   1. Your room contains more CDs than pieces of paper.  2. You’ve thought about installing cooling fans in your skull.  3. You refer to your computer as ‘she’.  4. You know the difference between ‘internet’ and ‘intranet’.  5. Your graphing calculator has more programs on it than your teacher’s computer.  6. You find yourself trying to hit control+Z in real life situations.  7. Your graphics card has a name.  8. You passionately support either ATI or nVidia.  9. You know what ATI and nVidia are and do.  10. People frequently call you ‘nerd’. *wink*  (note: I can poke fun at nerds because I know I am one.  For me it was #10.)

      I’m feeling a need to write, so I thought I’d open up Word and just let my thoughts flow.  Ha ha ha.  No, seriously, people are pressuring me to write something and post it.  Therefore, because I’m a spineless wimp, I’m going to try and be funny on command.  At present moment I’m on instant messenger, and I just asked someone for a topic to write about.  Instead, now we’re talking about the chemistry test I took today.  Fat lot of help they are.  So perhaps I can talk about the fact that some people update their online journal with every single little thing that they do.  Here’s a sample:  - I’m not doing much.  Just sitting here. [posted @ 8:30:33]  - I’m still here.  Now I’m scratching my head. [posted @ 8:34:19]  - Hey, I just inhaled really deeply.  Let’s see if I can do it again! [posted @ 8:35:28]  - Wow!  I did it again! [posted @ 8:35:39]  …and so on.  The only limit to how much detail they include is how fast they can click the buttons to update their journal.  Someone was telling me that “it’s the little things that count”, but really, do we have to know  all  the little things?  I’m just glad that these people don’t have laptops, or we might get  way  too much detail about their lives.  As long as I’m being spineless and giving in to demands, I might as well write something about missy_ly, who requested that I write something about her, though she didn’t know what.  So, here goes.  For some odd reason, her cell phone number was on my phone before we swapped numbers.  There.  Happy?  If someone asked me for all my money and clothes right now, they’d probably get them.  I still don’t have a decent topic.  Now my friend and I are talking about solar flares of the sixteenth century.  Not even remotely humorous.  Anyways, since my Coke’s almost done now, and I’m getting bored, I’ll leave you all with a question:  What’s a good question to end this column with?

      http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/ptech/03/03/sonic.weapon.ap/index.html  This is an article on the CNN.com about new technology for our troops.  That’s right; the Army’s getting new weapons.  And they are…you guessed it, high school assistant principals!  No, seriously, they are apparently noisemakers.  Now when you first hear this, you think of those little plastic thingies that they give out for party favors that entertain you and your parents for several days (and by entertain, I mean annoy to the point of a preference for court hearings over toothpaste tube size regulations over being in the same room as that dratted noisemaker) until the battery runs out.  Of course, our Army isn’t getting that.  It would be far too effective.  Instead, they get a little device called a Long Range Acoustic Device, or LRAD for short.  Well, maybe not little.  It weighs 45 pounds, which could lead to odd scenarios if the soldiers are outfitted with just an LRAD:  SOLDIER: Don’t move or I’ll shoot! INSURGENT: With what? SOLDIER (TRYING TO HEFT LRAD): With this!  Just…give me a second here…  But I’m sure no one would be  that  stupid, except perhaps Michael Jackson, whose music can melt brain tissue anyways.  Which brings me to my next point:  why invest money in a device that, I quote, “blasts earsplitting noise in a directed beam”, when we’ve already got them?  In fact, every teenager has them, along with ample ammunition.  CD players, loaded with modern music, can disable anyone over thirty in just a few minutes.  If they were equipped with a Michael Jackson CD, of course, they could drop anyone unconscious in a matter of seconds.  Thank God that Michael Jackson music is, by federal law, illegal to broadcast without proper ear protection.  A SIDE NOTE: Another system that the government is testing is the Active Denial system, which seems as if it should work like this:  A terrorist is trying to enter a maximum security U.S. Army building, perhaps a kitchen. ACTIVE DENIAL SYSTEM: Access Denied.  Please use other door. TERRORIST: (no response) ACTIVE DENIAL SYSTEM: I said, Access Denied, you moron.  Please leave or I will be forced to pipe Michael Jackson music directly into your brain. TERRORIST: NOOOOOO!!!!!!! (runs)  Instead, the Active Denial System is, I quote, “a painful energy beam”.  I suppose it’ll zap anyone who attacks it.  You’ve got to wonder, though, the usefulness of this in other walks of life.  Picture a courtroom…  JUDGE: Any objections? ATTOURNY: Your Honor, my client was brutally hurt because his nail scratched his palm on account of a smaller toothpaste tube size.  This is obviously an example of faulty manufacturing on the part of the huge toothpaste tube conglomorates, which want nothing more than to corrupt our youth and rule the-  ZAP  *thud* JUDGE (HOLDING SMOKING ACTIVE DENIAL SYSTEM) : Any  other  objections, you chatterboxes? COURTROOM: (silence)  I just hope the government keeps a close watch on its new toys.  What’s to say some rebel faction doesn’t get hold of these devices and use them to quash anyone who’s discovered their plans and are writing about them in, say, an online column.  What if…hey, what’s that noise?  Oh no!  They’re on to me!  Tell the people!  They have a right to know the tr-  ZAP  *thud*

       10 ways to know if you play too many computer RPGs:   1. When you buy clothes, you check the tag for the armor bonus.  2. When you pass a test, you think you’ve gained a level and feel a need to distribute those hard-earned stat points.  3. You talk to random people just to see how much interactivity your life was programmed with.  4. You always overburden yourself with stuff because you thought that your inventory was bigger than it actually is.  5. You get annoyed when people don't "join your party" just because you asked them to.  6. Instead of asking your teacher if you can retake a test, you ask them if you can retry the quest.  7. Every time you do anything for anyone, you expect money as a quest reward.  8. You sign your name as “[deathclan]sLAy3R_299”.  9. You use the word “emoted” frequently in place of “did”.  10. Instead of saying to people that you’re tired, you claim that you don’t have enough mana.

       NOTE: This was written sometime in January, after a particularly harrowing experience with someone’s science fair project.  I added a note at the end about the aftermath.    It was around 11:00 p.m., and I'd finally finished all my homework.  I climbed in bed, looking forward to a restful night, (followed by more hell the next day, of course, but that's a different story).  But it's a weird thing with me.  The longer I just lie in bed, thinking, the more things I think of that I'm convinced can't wait until the morning.  I have to completely wake myself up, turn on the lights and get my planner.  Next is the usual frantic search for a pencil; I usually end up writing with a stunted piece of lead that's so short I can't even hold it.  Finally, having written whatever it was down, I get back in bed.  Then I think of something else.  In this case, the mandatory 2 liter Coke bottle for the Math & Science tournament that Saturday.  I resisted, I really did.  I tried to tell myself that it could wait until the morning.  Of course, it didn't work.  Then the real trouble started.  When I got out my planner again, I was looking at the dates and I knew that I had forgotten something.  Something about Friday…Grace’s Science Fair project!  NOTE: Grace is not her real name, but I really don’t want Benita to hit me with her obscenely thick Stephen King book, so I’m changing her name for this column.  Muttering a steady stream of curses all the way, I stumbled down the dark hallway to the other room, where the CD player was.  Actually, it's a boom box, and actually, it's quite heavy.  I must have dented the walls three or four times on the return trip.  I fished out her science fair project packet from my backpack, ripped out the staples of the sealed packet, and dumped the contents out on the floor.  The project involved having people (mostly those that Grace didn’t like) listen to vocabulary words every night for a few days in a row, and then when they woke up, take a test to find out how much they’ve learned.  Keep in mind that it was around 12:30 a.m. by this time.  I put the CD for the words into my CD player: "This is a test to see if you can memorize vocabulary words in sleep…" and so on.  Then it started with music.  Loud music.  Of course, in the middle of the night, everything is loud.  But there was nothing else to do.  I turned the volume down to the level where it was just barely audible, covered the green, glowing screen of the CD player with Grace’s tests, and went to sleep.  Or rather, I tried.  When there's nothing going on but music, and you're trying to go to sleep: it's extremely hard.  One thing was obvious.  The music was still too loud.  After about ten minutes it sounded like it was right in my ears, even though the CD player was across the room.  I turned the volume down again, to the point that an extremely sensitive dog would have a hard time hearing it, and went back to bed.  The next thirty minutes (or so it seemed) had me wondering when the actual words were going to start.  Maybe Grace had mixed up the CDs.  To make things worse, the music was not sleepy music.  It was some sort of  allegro , or something; it was  fast .  Scales going up and down tens of thousands of times, huge finales, dynamic contrast, it was all there.  By now I was entertaining glorious visions of taking my bedside lamp and sending it flying in a perfect arc across the room to smash the CD player to bits.  I'm not sure how, but I finally managed to get to sleep.  Or maybe it was more along the lines of losing consciousness.  Around 4 or 5, I think, I woke up again.  It was still playing music.  It had probably just gone around the CD a couple of times, but if listening to music had me lying awake, then listening to a person reading vocabulary words would be torture.  I lurched out of bed, trailing sheets that were tangled around me, and lunged for the power button.  The green screen faded, the red power light extinguished itself.  I went back to sleep.  I had to catch up for all the rest I had missed.  Of course, by then I only had about an hour before I had to wake up.  I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do about this.  I came up with many solutions to my problem while listening to the melodies of Mozart at 1 in the morning, starting with claiming that I had lost the CDs going through simply pretending I had listened to the CDs and just taking the tests anyways, all the way to setting one of those plug timers on my CD player and having it turn on in a couple of hours when I would probably be asleep.  (By the way, the last didn't work because the CD player doesn't turn on automatically when it is plugged in or receives power.)  Wish me luck and sound sleep.  I’m going to need it.  ADDED: I eventually decided to not listen to the CDs, but instead to fake the entire test.  On a few of the answers, just to make it seem authentic, I purposefully messed up.  Just don’t tell Grace.  It’ll be hard to explain the blood and brain particles on her book when she has to return it to the library.

      What's happened to the world these days?  Take, for example, Cracker Jacks.  They used to be in cardboard boxes with actual prizes, like rings and crap.  They were so cool!  When I was in elementary school, that's all I ever played with.  And then sometimes you'd stumble across one of those 'special' boxes.  You know, the ones filled with the white powder and money?  Those were great, too!  For some reason, my mind links those special boxes with the best times of my life.  Like that time we set the neighbor's cat on fire.  Or that car that we stole and drove into our house.  Those were the days...  But now they have stupid little foil packages like chips or something.  I'll bet they aren't even covered with caramel anymore!  It's probably just brown paint and sugar.  And now they only have dinky paper things for "prizes".  What kind of prize is that?  They just have mind puzzles and crap!  What's up with that?  So there you have it.  Irrefutable* proof that our world is going to the dogs.  *Vocabulary word

      Probably no one remembers my "Know Yourself" aphorism for life.  It just means that you should know the real reasons that you do things.  Anyways, so I accidentally poked Ha the other day, and she got all freaked out, because I went through her little 'bubble' thing.  And that set me wondering...do we have mental bubbles as well?  I think we do.  They are mental shells, one inside the other, that go down and down until you reach your inner center.  Mine (that I've been able to identify), are:  Everyone - This is for people whom I don't know. Friends - Anyone whom I've talked to and know their name, essentially. Close Friends - People that I've known for a relatively long amount of time, and who I can generally trust. REALLY Close Friends - Only two or so people in this catagory.  I would trust them with anything. Family - my family Myself - this is where my consciousness actually is Inner Center - This is my subconscious, I guess, or whatever you want to call it.  It is this part that I refer to when I say "know yourself".  I think that here, at your inner center, are all your true feelings and emotions.  It is very difficult to talk to yourself, simply because we lie to ourselves much of the time.  More on this later.  Peace.

Again, is sometimes lighthearted, but many posts are evidence of her truly insightful mind.  urlLink  Inside MY Head   By Barira Munshi.

The nominees for Best HTML Use are...    urlLink  PK1013   Pranay's xanga seems to always have random experiments with html hanging around.  It's like a fortune cookie of coding; you never know what html weirdness you'll find.  urlLink  No Pretense   An odd title for Maerilly's xanga, but nevertheless contains excellent html work.  Every time you visit there is usually something new floating around, singing, scrolling, or popping up.  urlLink  Knurd Unit   Yet again, the blog by Pranay, Joy, Maerilly, Sarah, and Nirav gets a Blogster nomination.

      *Sigh* just reminiscing about TMSCA State some more.  I remember one time when Mr. Trinh, Tram, Daniel, Mr. Cantu, Andy, and I were playing VC in one of the rooms.  We were taking turns trading in and out; the two losers went out.  At one point when I was out, Pranay, Neil, and Shalin came in.  Because there were now a lot of us not playing, I suggested starting another game.  Mr. Trinh said, and I quote, "Naah, this is where the PROS play, Nirav.  What's the matter?  Can't hang with us?" So I didn't say anything, and the next game I was in.  The others had gone ahead and started the other game in the room next door. That next game I came in first, and Trinh was last.  He got up, and mumbled something about checking in on the other room. I said loudly, in triumph, "What's the matter, Mr. Trinh?  I thought this is where the pros play!  Huh?  HUH?" He just left. It was sweet, very, very sweet.

      The other day, when I came back from my viola lesson, I went out to the lake near my house to relax, and to talk to someone on my cell phone. I was walking toward the bench next to the lake, when a feathery missile hurtled past me.  It was a duck.  The freaking duck had attacked me, missing by mere centimeters. Later, while I was talking on my phone, another duck (or possibly the same one) began to approach me from the lake.  It was just waddling toward me, quacking every few steps. All in all, it was seemed remarkably like a teacher of mine (whom I will not name here). It got to within about a foot of me, at which point I fled to the relative safety of the other side of the bench, fearing that it would produce a machine gun, or perhaps a spool of piano wire from beneath its wings. There's something about these ducks at our lake that's really creepy.  A year or two ago, I was going for a walk around the lake at around nine or so.  It was dark, and all I had was a penlight on my keychain.  The ducks were all on the lake, sleeping. Or so I thought. As soon as I passed the large, dark, mass of fowl, they awoke, and began to silently follow me. They were led by the Grey Duck, a huge monstrosity of a bird who looked as though she was perpetually mad at everyone and everything. Even in daylight, she was scary, charging at anyone who approached her domain (which was really the entire lake). But here, at night, it was downright terrifying.  They moved in concert down the lake, keeping pace with me precisely. Eventually they lost interest, or at least appeared to, but I had a feeling the the Grey Duck had sent a few duck commandos after me, darting from tree to tree behind me. On my way back, I was walking home on the other side of the lake, and it is a truly chilling sight to see about thirty or forty ducks detach themselves from the opposite side of the lake, and move, army-like, inexorably toward you. I stopped to watch, rather like a deer stops to admire the headlights of the 18-wheeler barreling toward it.  Taking out my penlight, I played it over the dark, feathered, mass drifting slowly toward me. It seemed to my slightly nervous mind that they were glaring at me. The newspaper headlines ran through my mind:    Boy Disappeared Near Lake, Bloody Feather Found  Investigators Finally Get Lead On Duck Mafia   As the ducks hit the water's edge, they began to scramble out of the water.  A small group accumulated on the edge, then they all began to move towards me. That's when I started to walk faster, into the dark night.  So anyways, long story short, I just barely escaped.  I am definately never going for a walk at night again.  They missed me once.  They won't miss again...

      Congratulations to those people who did good at UIL District! And to those of you who didn't do so well...you already know you suck. No, seriously, good job to everyone who went.  Special congrats to Pranay, Anu, Stacy, Rupak, Spandana because they actually won stuff.  Good luck to everyone going to regionals!  Oh yeah, I guess I'd better say something about Ha, because she's going to regionals for L-D after her first year of debate.  All I have to say is, it's all my doing, because I wrote both her cases, plus prepping her for the tournament. Okay fine, I just wrote her cases. Okay, just the aff one. All right, I just helped her with it. Fine, I just made fun of her via my cell phone while she wrote her case with no help whatsoever.  I probably made it worse rather than better. Happy?  Anyways...good job and good luck to UIL people.

      So here are Pranay and me, playing cards.  We're at the house of a neighborhood mutual family friend; our parents are chatting with them, so Pranay and I are bored. My back is to the glass door to the backyard, and we're playing ERS.  I'm losing, and then suddenly Pranay, who's been looking out over my shoulder into the yard, starts laughing and telling me to turn around. "Yeah, right!" I'm not falling for that one. "No really! Look!" I follow the line of his finger and there, in the house behind, on the balcony, is this guy in a muscle shirt and jeans, and he's completely bending over a big flowerpot or something, presenting us with a beautiful view of his backside. OH MY GOD!!!!!!! It was hilarious.  Then he went inside the glass balconey door, and we couldn't see him for a while.  Between laughing so hard our stomachs hurt, Pranay and I started playing again, but we both kept on looking back, and then our hopes came true.  He came out again, and bent slowly over another flowerpot. It was like he was TRYING to give us a show or something. Then he goes back inside, carrying the flowerpot. After we recovered from this one, I tossed a small salute in the general direction of the backyard. Then, as if to oblige me, he appeared right behind the glass door, and, from a sideways angle this time, bent over again! It was hilariously traumatic, to say the least. ...whew...my sides hurt from laughing.

      On Wednesday, the drama people performed their UIL One-Act Play for the school during second period.  Although I wanted to go, I couldn't, because second period is orchestra, and Mr. Soto had hired a clinician to come in and give us the help we so desperately needed. The lady who came in was Korean.  Her name, as far as we could make out, was Ms. Pizz.  How much more musical can you get? My first impression was that of a mime.  She had so much makeup on that it looked rather like a mask over her face. But Ms. Pizz was anything BUT a mime.  She talked constantly, and she had this way of making weird jokes, then laughing, or rather, cackling, at them, then suddenly getting serious again.  Here's something she actually said: "This is beginning!  It is most important!  I tell my students, I say, get beginning and end correct, don't care about middle.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, but anyways..." And then she'd continue on with what she was saying.  It was like she was schizophrenic or something. And another thing: she told Mr. Soto, and us, that she didn't want to conduct us; that was Mr. Soto's job.  But whenever she'd tell him to start, after two or three measures, she'd either: A. Shriek so loud that our strings spontaneously detuned, and make us stop and do something over. B. Step directly in FRONT of Mr. Soto and take over. C. Dance around behind Mr. Soto, conducting us herself. The last one was the worst.  She'd bob slightly up and down on her knees, and conduct in little jerky motions.  But the worst part was, she'd be going at a completely different tempo than Mr. Soto.  Then after a few measures: "AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!  STOP STOP STOP!!!!!!!!  You all go at different tempo.  This half goes at this tempo, and other half goes at other tempo.  You must watch Mistah Soh-Toh!" I wanted to scream, "IT'S BECAUSE HALF OF US ARE FOLLOWING YOU, LADY!!!!" But I didn't, of course. Don't take this the wrong way; I'm not criticizing her.  We did get a lot done.  And she's definately not as strange as the man who does the string orchestra sectionals at Houston Youth Symphony and makes bird-like spasmatic motions with his head when he plays. Yet... Anyways, she did get really into her job.  She started chugging down water by the gallon, it seemed, and wiping off sweat every few seconds from her forehead.  Her makeup mask began to dissolve and run down her face, making her even weirder-looking than before. Now I know why some people are afraid of clowns.

      I think I'll write a play...  ----------  So...What Now?  -----  By Nirav Sanghani  -----  Cast: Ralph Sally  ----- [Ralph and Sally are sitting at a table in a coffee-shop]  Ralph: So that's it then.  We're done.  It's over.  Sally: Yeah, I guess so.  R: [sighs]  S: [sighs]  R: Pity, too.  We would have been so-  S: -great together, I know.  But it was-  R: -my decision, yeah.  Actually, I thought it was up to both of us.  S: Hey, I told you my end.  It's only up to you now.  R: Sure thing.  S: Did I detect sarcasm in that statement?  R: Perhaps...  S: [sighs]  R: What?  S: Nothing.  R: You always say that.  S: Say what?  R: "Nothing."  S: No, tell me!  R: I just did!  You always say "nothing."  S: Oh.  R: Right.  S: So...what now?  R: Hey, I've got an idea!  S: That's a first.  R: I suppose I deserved that.  S: Yes you did.  R: We should just get married and skip all the dating crap.  S: Now, how does that work?  R: Never mind.  S: Okay.  If you say so.  [begins to hum tunelessly]  R: Hey, kid...what's that tune you always hum?  S: I wasn't aware I was humming the same tune. [begins to hum again, listens to herself] Wow!  You're right.  R: So what is it then?  S: I don't know.  R: Oh.  S: Yeah.  R: So...what now?  S: I honestly have no idea.  R: As usual.  S: Wait...was that an insult?  R: Probably.  S: Oh, okay.  Just checking.  R: Right.  S: I think you're over-analyzing this.  R: Am I?  S: Yes, yes you are.  R: Am I really?  S: Um...yes?  R: Oh, okay.  Just checking.  S: Okay.  So anyways, you need to look at the big picture.  R: What big picture?  S: You know, step back and look at everything as a whole.  I mean, inspecting the nooks and crannies is good, but sometimes you just have to look at the whole thing, plain and simple.  R: But what if it's not simple?  S: It is, trust me.  R: You know, things aren't as clear for me as they are for you.  S: Just think about it for a while.  R: But I don't want to think!  Wait...that sounded just like you!  S: And right now, I'm the one giving the advice...  R: ...meaning you stole my mind!  S: And enjoying it very much, thank you.  R: Just don't get it dirty or anything...  S: I'll take good care of it, don't worry.  R: ...though of course, I suppose the inside of your skull is exceptionally clean, not having had to hold anything before.  S: I'm sorry, what was that?  R: Nothing...  S: Was that another insult?  R: [smiles]  S: Grr.  R: [sighs]  S: This is getting pointless.  R: All of our conversations have been pointless, since...you know.  S: Yeah.  R: This is the hugest subject avoidance I've ever seen.  S: [nods]  R: So...  S: So...  R & S: ...what now?  ----------  Thank you very much, I hope you enjoyed my short play.  I know I enjoyed writing it. :-)

      Gotta love those Freudian slips!   urlLink Life really is like a sitcom .  I think mine's this bad UPN one that you think is the corniest show ever, but you still watch it just because you've got nothing better to do.  My second season just ended...it got higher ratings than last year, but the season finale left something to be desired.  I guess we're just going to have to wait for the premiere this August.  And it really is all in the timing.

      The title says it all.  We're halfway done with high school.  Yeesh.  So here's the rundown on exams week (starting Saturday, because that's when I started studying):   Saturday : I met  Luis, Maria, Joy, Brandon (Cogan), and Alicia  at Barnes and Noble to study  World History and Chemistry .  The main thing that happened was that Luis got me all the correct answers to the old chem tests (which didn't help much anyways; see  Thursday )...then Cogan and Joy left...Alicia showed up for around five-sixths of a second and left again...and so Luis, Maria, and I are left hanging around Starbucks.  We played cards for a while; I learned poker (yay!) and, after not being able to get Pranay or Ha to come there to play  Spades , Luis asked a  random stranger  if he knew how to play Spades...which I didn't want to teach, so we ended up playing V.C....the random person was Asian, so he won, of course.  I had a  Java Chip Frapuccino , which was excellent. Then we gave up cards, and Luis quizzed Maria and me on World History...half the answers seemed to be "unrestricted submarine warfare"...don't ask. Maria had to go, leaving Luis and I supremely bored at b&n.  and hungry, we were pretty hungry too.  (oh yeah, and  maerilly  was SUPPOSED to come, but she skipped out on us) So we decided to walk over to the buildings in the parking lot of b&n, but there was no place there that we could afford.  we ended up walking to  First Colony Mall  and eating in the food court, where I saw  Amanda Comer . Then Luis realized he was supposed to meet his ride at  AMC First Colony  about fifteen minutes ago and had to run, so I just waited for my parents to pick me up...after that I went to  CiCi's  with my family (yes, the stammtisch CiCi's).  Went to sleep pretty soon after we came back.   Sunday : I was SUPPOSED to be studying this day, but I had decided the day before that I couldn't study at home; it's SO MUCH EASIER to study at b&n.  So again, I got a ride there from my dad.  Also, I realized the secret to studying at a bookstore: you have to know what you're going to get distracted by...in my case (at b&n) it's ALWAYS that I end up picking up some random book and read instead of studying.  So, in order to keep myself on track, I called  Ha  and got her to come keep me company.  I was studying precal that day, and my plan worked tremendously well (see Monday). We found a book that she'd known about called  All in the Timing  (title of my blog now), which has 14 one-act plays by a guy called  David Ives .  REALLY hilarious.  we want to do  'variations on the death of trotsky'  for reader's theater next year. I had ANOTHER java chip frapuccino (thanks to Ha), which probably wasn't exceptionally good for me.  She had coffee too, but I guess it didn't work too well, because after about an hour or so she nearly fell asleep.  Anyways, so I did in fact get some work done. Her dad got there, so she left.  In about five minutes I had found a book on game design and was reading that for the next twenty minutes until my mom called and said she was almost there to come get me. Also, I found a cd in the music section by  Dispatch  which I MUST buy soon.  I just need money.   Monday : Took  PreCal and German .  I thought this would be my hardest day, but in fact that ended up being Friday, ironically enough.  PreCal was grueling, but not exceptionally hard.  German was actually pretty hard.  Got home, went to sleep, woke up, ate, went back to sleep.   Tuesday :  Multimedia and Compsci .  Easy stuff.  After compsci the girls were playing this game that resulted in a prediction of  neil  grabbing  shalin's butt .  Gross stuff.  After multimedia I did an audioblogger post of  blake  spreading...he didn't spread his fastest, but oh well.  After school I did pretty much the same thing as the day before: got home, went to sleep, woke up, ate, went back to sleep.   Wednesday :  English and World History .  Both were moderately easy.  The World History final was exactly like the review, thank God.   Thursday : That's today, savvy?  During  Orchestra , we played  Spades .  The result?   Mr. So to and I thoroughly kicked  Asif's and Naveed's collective butt .  Of course, Asif blames it all on Naveed.  I really should have studied for chem instead, because the next period, I got completely owned by the  Chemistry  final.  200 questions in about 1.5 hours.  Pure hell.  I should be okay...I can miss 56 questions and still make an A for the semester.  Also, I ran out of time, so I called  The Random Crap Rule , which states:  If you write down Completely Random Crap on a test, you're bound to get at least ONE answer correct .  I very much hope so. Oh yeah, and I found out my PreCal grade: 98.  NINETY-EIGHT!  If it wasn't the last day of school, I'd get jumped by juniors; I completely wrecked the grade curve.  mwahaha.  So I guess studying at b&n worked after all.  Peace out, friends.  Enjoy your summer, and DON'T BE SMART UNTIL AUGUST!

      So as some (or perhaps none) of you might know, I got into the  urlLink GMail  (google mail) beta test.  Apparently people will go to great lengths to get a gmail account (which i got through  urlLink blogger , but only some people can get that). on  urlLink gmail swap , a site dedicated to letting invitations to gmail be traded, people offer the strangest things.  i've seen a human liver, a left index finger nail, an unused cd key for counter-strike, domesticated animals, and my personal favorite,  urlLink "the last lingering shreds of my dignity"  (scroll down if you clicked on the last one) also, gmail accounts have been sold for over $150 on  urlLink ebay .  wow.  i should've done that.  oddly, finals haven't really hit me yet.  i'm off to  urlLink b&n  to study, but they still seem really far off...  urlLink mochacappafrappuccino!   ...  just came back from b&n and a java chip frappuccino (thanks again!) i'm not sure what just happened...a close friend told me that she did some soul-searching and is mostly at peace with herself; i think my inner balance just got thrown off...  P.S. ...yes, there is a  urlLink dispatch  cd there; it has two cds: around 20 songs from live performances...that's where i went when your (you know who you are) dad came...  ALSO!!! the new title of my blog comes from the title of a collection of short plays by  urlLink David Ives .  he's a brilliant one-act playwright...he wrote "variations on the death of trotsky" (which is my new subheading and also "sure thing", among others...really hilarious

      So here i am, finally blogging about the gala.  Pratham : volunteer movement to help raise literacy among children in India (and doing a pretty good job of it too).  every year they hold this huge gala (700 ppl) to raise money: tickets are $100 each, but it's more of a donation thing.  for that you get a cocktail hour, followed by fancy dinner with hindi music, then dancing and crap. [note: i just realized that my entire involvement in pratham stemmed directly out of  mrs. lafleur's  volunteer project; must thank her for that] anyways, so i got to the  Westin Galleria ballroom  at around 2:00, shortly thereafter  Manasy , the head of volunteers, arrived.  we hung around for a while; she told me that she told ppl to be there at 2:30 (i was early) in hopes that they might actually arrive by 3.  finally  Mani auntie  came with the crap that we had to put on all the dinner tables, which we started doing. around that time  meera, nupur, priya, silkie (?), and some other girls whose names i don't remember  showed up (carrying boxes from  the Cheesecake factory , no less). also a fellow soph from Memorial high school showed up,  nikhil , bringing the total count of nikhils i know up to  243 .  no, i'm kidding, it's just  6 or so . so i'm like, cool, i finally know someone here, cuz meera and nupur and priya go to  hightower  (even though i didn't really know them, i knew OF them), and nikhil was cool too, although hungry.  all the time.  and i mean ALL the time. so what happened next...hm....right, so then the guys, meaning nikhil, me, and the adult guys went up to the rooms that mani auntie had reserved for us volunteers to change.  finally when we got back downstairs, they had food for the volunteers; some  really kickass stuffed jalapenos  that challenged even MY taste buds. wow...freakin' awesome. (there was more food too; the jalapenos just stick out in my memory) so then i'm hanging around the stage with  this guy  who's like in his forties or something and who manasy said is with me helping with audio/visual crap.  the audio DJ/mixer guy was named  nadeem ; he was pretty good. then the  a capella group from UT  showed up, they're called HUM (click  urlLink HERE  for a link to their website, buy a CD) don't ask me why it's all in caps...it just is. so they're pretty cool; i helped nadeem hook up their mics and crap.   one of the singers  says she knows me from somewhere; she looked familiar too, just can't place her face...hm... so i ended up going to  Mokund (?) uncle  and asking what i'm supposed to do; he told me to keep the singers happy; which was perfectly fine by me, they're cool ppl.  so i ended up putting them in the side room where the volunteers had eaten to hang around; then everyone seemed to forget about them until they were supposed to sing, at which point i had to dash backstage and around tables to get them... but i'm getting ahead of myself. next what happened was  meera  swiped us (me and nikhil) to help with flower arrangements.   FLOWER ARRAGEMENTS .  of all things...yeesh.  nupur was showing us how to do it when nikhil got a cell phone call and left (he never came back) and i managed to sneak out too (sorry nupur...lol) so that guy i was hanging around with?  his name was like  akshay (?) uncle  or something like that...i only found out MUCH LATER that he was  NUPUR'S DAD !!!  i would've watched what i was talking about...yeesh again. we found out that nupur's little sister goes to dulles middle school where she's taught by  ellen townley , who's MY private viola teacher, so it's a small world after all, yadda yadda yadda....etc. so next we have the thing starting and crap.  ppl are getting drunk on whiskey in the lobby while i was running around doing all that stuff that i mentioned before... finally we let them into the ballroom.  they found their tables and stuff.  apparently there was a big fuss about registration cuz there were so many ppl who just randomly CAME without telling us...but you'll have to ask one of the  fish girls  about that; i wasn't there. so HUM performed...they're REALLY good...wow...i bought a cd for $5...definately worth it. (listening to it all weekend + today) let's see...what's next...? right, so then me and rest of kids are sitting around and eating dinner (FREAKING DISGUSTING) and after that was ice cream cake.  then they started playing more dance-ish music and the  OLD PEOPLE STARTED DANCING ...SO SCARY!!  someone said that she hoped they didn't get a heart attack...i concur...yeesh! plus a bunch of them were half-drunk...including Mokund uncle, a VOLUNTEER!  he was dancing with his  whiskey , no less.  so weird. so Manasy wanted  us kids  to dance to get them started, but we figured they were already pretty well started (and they were) so we were just hanging out and doing random hindi dance stuff on the side...WISH WE HAD DANDYAS THERE!! nikhil and i tried to do  dandya ras with our hands ...didn't quite have the same effect (lol!). slow-dance music came on...i had the extremely strange experience of seeing  two girls DANCE AS IF THEY WERE LESBIANS !!! i'm still not sure that they AREN'T! learned how to  slow-dance  (thanks nupur and meera!), so now i PROBABLY won't trip over my own or other people's feet..yay! we slowdanced for a bit until faster music came on.  by this time more ppl had left and the dance floor was clear enough for us (and  three ppl from HUM ) to do the  12-step garbah dance thing  around the floor...fun, 'cept i kept on getting screwed up 'cuz they started on an off-beat. tired and exhausted, but having just had the most fun i'd had all year, i headed down to the lobby to meet my mom who was picking me up (because SOMEONE couldn't take me HOME!...jk) so peace ya'll.... pratham gala  was really fun...and i even left out a lot... i was there for  a grand total of 12 HOURS ...wow... catch ya'll later.  P.S. leave a comment! (click where it says 'comments')

      So I've realized that for some strange reason I associate people, objects, events, etc. with music.  There's usually a story behind it too.  My sister: Matchbox 20 - Bright Lights She and I are just turning down our street (she's driving) when this song comes on that we both like, but neither of us knows what it is.  So we drive around our neighborhood for the next five minutes until it's done, then we went home and both rushed to the internet to find the name.  It took a little while, but it was Bright Lights.  Then we, uh, procured a version of the song.  Colin: Eagle Eye Cherry - Save Tonight That guy can sing, even though it doesn't seem like it.  This is the only song I've heard Colin sing.  Jordan: Dispatch - Two Coins I just emailed her this song recently; she downloaded it and was trying to play it when this person in a chat room she was in started playing rap, so Jordan thought that I had emailed her rap music...she got it working eventually.  Ha: The Violet Burning - I'm No Superman This song was on my blog, and apparently she used to go and listen to it all the time.  I finally burned it on a cd for her.  I'm just waiting until she gets tired of it, but that doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon.  When I think of more, I'll post them.  The links are in my mind; I just have to hear the song somewhere first.  Another note: My DBQ essay ended up to be SIX FULL PAGES, double-spaced.  That's the best report I've ever written.  Check out this sentence:  "Although Rhodes is quite biased toward England, one can analyze his justification of imperialism through English nationalism to uncover the core cause of the nineteenth century British obsession with colonization; they believed that it was their 'creed…dream…and mission.'"  It's just awesome!  I didn't plan it that way; I wrote it and then I'm thinking "That's freaking unintelligable!".  It's the debate influence, I know.

      The english language is so weird.  to show you what i mean, let's look at a passage from Shakespeare's  Romeo and Juliet , translated into English through the ages...  -------------------------------- SCENE I. Verona. A public place.  Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers  SAMPSON  Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.  GREGORY  No, for then we should be colliers.  SAMPSON  I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.  GREGORY  Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.  SAMPSON  I strike quickly, being moved.  GREGORY  But thou art not quickly moved to strike.  SAMPSON  A dog of the house of Montague moves me.  GREGORY  To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away. ------------------------------------------ That was the original Shakespeare...now let's see the modern summary/translation, courtesy of  urlLink SparkNotes ... ------------------------------------------  Sampson and Gregory, two servants of the house of Capulet, stroll through the streets of Verona. With bawdy banter, Sampson vents his hatred of the house of Montague. The two exchange punning remarks about physically conquering Montague men and sexually conquering Montague women.  ----------------------------------------- and now translated to the way a AOL user would write it, via the  urlLink AOLer Translator ... ----------------------------------------- SCENE I. Verona. A public place.  Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers SAMPSON GRAGORY O MAH WORD WAL NOT CARY COALS  GREGORY NO FOR THEN WA SHUD B COLEIRS  SAMPSON I MAAN AN WE B IN CHOLAR W3L DRAW  GREGORY AY WHIEL U LIEV DRAW UR NEK OUT O DA COLAR  SAMPSON I STRIEK QUIKLY BNG MOVED  GREGORY BUT THOU ART NOT QUIKLY MOVED 2 STRIEK  SAMPSON A DOG OF TEH HOUSA OF MONTAGU3 MOV3S ME  GREGORY 2 MOV3 IS 2 STIR AND 2 B VALIANT IS 2 THEIR IF THOU ART MOVAD THOU RUNST AWAY!!1!

      Current time...11:58 PM  my aim conversations are slowly ending as one by one, people either go to sleep or get annoyed with me.  mostly they go like this:  hOtangel: why dont u go 2 sleep? nirav015: i'm too lazy to drag myself the two feet to my bed hOtangel: thats just insane nirav015: well nirav015: i also have to turn off the light hOtangel: you're just a lazy beep nirav015: sounds about right  (note: hOtangel is nupur, not some random online hooker, as it may seem by the name) here's another funny excerpt:  hOtangel: todays the first day i was home the whole day hOtangel: all i did was SLEEP nirav015: i've been home for the past week...consider yourself lucky hOtangel: ive been out VOLUNTEERING hOtangel: i consider that fun, eh? nirav015: right hOtangel: volunteering my foot nirav015: i didn't know anyone would want your foot  ...right.  here's what else i've been doing: reading archives from  urlLink Real Life Comics  (it's an online comic strip, idiot).  i think colin suggested it to me. i was thinking about drawing a comic strip myself, but i realized that i can't draw worth a crap.  my comic self portrait looks like a lima bean.  and i'm not joking. so if you, dear reader, have anything at all to do, please leave a comment or tag the message board because I (to use a cliche) am bored beyond belief.  if you're bored just like me, IM me and we'll have a pointless conversation.  P.S. it's the next day.  i'm having a pointless conversation with  urlLink maerilly ...excerpts:  nirav015: you know what? ooooolala06: chicken butt? nirav015: no  ...and...  ooooolala06: FIND A BLOG SKIN! nirav015: I WILL nirav015: SOMEDAY nirav015: whenever i get off my lazy beep and get around to it ooooolala06: then get off it now! ooooolala06: hehe nirav015: it happens to be quite comfortable where it is, thank you very much

      What's going on??  I feel like all my friends have left me.  Everyone's either:  1. On a cruise (Joy) 2. In Germany (Jordan, Andrew, most people in German) 3. In Iowa (Pranay) 4. Under house arrest (Ha) 5. Just logged off AIM (Maerilly) 6. Not on AIM at all (everyone else)  It's boring!  Especially since I actually have work to do; I'm taking the Chemistry SAT II on Saturday, and I'm supposed to be studying. I've taken to playing Tien Len, also known as VC, with Maria and Luis.  That, or I've been playing  urlLink iSketch . Also, I've been checking my  urlLink Gmail  inbox.  Repeatedly.  As though I expect someone to email me.  Even though I haven't emailed anyone. You can see how much my life has degenerated.  I need b&n, coffee, and spades.

      The Democratic National Convention just got off to a rousing start. In case you missed it, here's the general jist of Bill Clinton's speech.   I come to you today to talk about John Kerry.  He will be great because he has the same name as other great presidents such as John Adams and John Kennedy.  And so does his vice president, John Edwards.  The Republicans had many views on running this country over the past four years, such as...[descends into technical mumbling]...and in consequence, making little old ladies carry their own groceries!  If you want this, go ahead, by all means vote for them.  But if not, JOHN KERRY AND JOHN EDWARDS ARE HERE!!!  George W. Bush also did things like tax cuts the rich...[complicated mumbling again]...which in turn, closed down all schools and made every child join a gang simply to eat every day!  If this is your idea of America, vote for him.  But if you don't think that's right, JOHN KERRY'S YOUR MAN!!!  If you want to vote for the party that I'm pretty sure had something to do with the West Nile virus, go ahead, but if not, VOTE FOR JOHN KERRY AND THE DEMOCRATS!!!  When the Vietnam War arrived, I ducked military duty along with Bush.  But when they asked John Kerry, he said, "Send me!".  When the Army asked John Kerry to go in for dangerous missions, he didn't hide.  He said, "Send me!".  And then later, when volunteers were needed to infiltrate an evil scientist's lab on a remote island, John Kerry said, "Send me!".  When America was threatened by a huge asteriod, did John Kerry run?  No!  He donned his red and blue tights and flew into outer space to stop it with his bare hands, shouting, "Send me!".  And remember, his name's John.  That's the basic idea.  Good night, everybody.

      Last night I had a dream.  In it, someone I miss dearly came to my house, somehow, and we were just sitting and chatting.  And that, just being there talking, was complete heaven.  I haven't seen this person since school ended, just seen them on AIM, said "hi!" over the phone.  But there's nothing like actually talking; nothing replaces face-to-face conversation. Today has been the worst day of a horrible week.  My shoulder's been hurting from viola playing, I have to learn a piece that I'm playing as a favor for the bride in a wedding in Albany, NY tomorrow; I've been overstressed, overworked, and yelled at all day.  And all this with no frappuccino to get me through the day, too. But every time I get way too depressed, I just calm down, take a deep breath, and remember that wonderful feeling I had, just talking.  And then, when I'm playing my piece for that wedding, I only have to remember the feeling I had when I woke up and realized it was all a dream to push that extra emotion into the music.

      ...quoting the T-101 from the Terminator series.  So yes, I'm back, but it may not be for long, depending on how lazy/active I am.  Some updates: - I've taken up harmonica, which is going pretty well.  The only problem is a lack of music to play. - My summer music camp, the American Festival for the Arts (AFA), is also going great.  We had an excellent first concert, and we're all set to have another one in two weeks, when we're playing Tschaikovsky's 2nd Symphony. - I have 5 invitations to Gmail from my account.  So if I know you (or probably even if I don't), leave me a message on the tagboard and I'll see if I want to give you one. - For anyone who's out of town, or going to be out of town, have fun and use sunscreen!  At least over here, the funked up Houston weather has kicked in, making it either pouring rain or hot and humid. - I'm leaving for Albany, NY a week from today for a wedding, which should be fun. And that's about it for now.  Oh, and I think I'm going to finish my short story that I started a while ago.  If I ever do finish, I'll post the three parts up here one by one for your reading pleasure. Enjoy your summer break!

      I reformatted my hard drive today, and therefore I have to copy all my backups back to my newly cleansed computer. It's taking quite a while, so I just decided to get it done tonight and stay up late. That's when I saw him. "He" was some sort of insect. He was about as long as the diameter of a quarter and had six legs, extremely long feelers, and some sort of strange, rotating tail. He was on the wall behind my computer. Now, that's not the weirdest bug I've seen. When I was in India last summer with my family, I glimpsed a large colorful insect on a flight of stairs. It was doing the strangest thing, too. It would fling itself against one wall of the stairwell with all its might, then flop to the ground, where after a couple seconds of recovery, it would once again fly madly at the other wall. This went on for quite some time. Eventually we just hopped over the step. But back to this one. I tolerated he while talking on the phone to a friend; he just crawled around and occasionally flew a few feet along the wall. It seemed like he was exercising. Eventually he expanded his workout to include another wall, and an periodic foray across the room. I couldn't stand it anymore.  I considered sleeping out in the hall and even dragged my bedsheets and pillows outside, but then I decided, this is MY room so HE'D better get out. I crept back inside my room, fearing that he might not be in the same place as when I'd left.  He wasn't, but after a few seconds of frantic searching during which chills ran up my spine with increasing frequency, I located the bug doing a cool-down routine on the windowshade. Keeping my eye on him, I sat down on my couch.  I needed a plan, but the only one I could think of was to scare him off the window and swat him out of the air.  It'd make a big mess to splat him all over the window.  That plan would have to do. I snuck across the room and grabbed the largest book on the bookshelf.  Then I edged over to the window.  A sudden move should do it.  I swung the book near him, and he fled the window, only to run straight into my second swing. For a second I thought he had splattered himself across the book, then I saw him in the corner.  He was flipping over himself repeatedly.  I knew I must have injured him, but I wasn't sure, so I sat down to watch him.  After a while he became motionless.  Dead.  Finally.  I went back outside to get my sheets and pillows. When I got back in he had crawled halfway up the wall. "No," I whispered.  "You're dead."  In disbelief I watched as he crawled in a circle a few times, as if to show off. Maybe I had just hit his wing or something.  At least he couldn't fly anymore.  But what to do now? My eyes lighted on the laminated periodic table of the elements lying in another corner of my room.  I knew it was good for something. I used it to flick the bug off the wall.  He caught himself in midair and took off flying around the room.  Apparently I hadn't damaged him at all. He finally flew near the door, which I had thankfully left open.  I waited until he had strayed out the door, then kicked it shut. Whew. Of course, there's always that crack underneath the door...

      Here are a few items of interest:  1. The All-State excerpts have been posted at the  urlLink TMEA website . They also updated the errata for the etudes that were posted earlier this summer.  2. An excellent online comic caught my attention that you guys should check out. It's called  urlLink Real Life Comics , by Greg Dean.  3. Tomorrow (Tuesday) is decoration day for the orchestra at Hightower. If you're in orchestra and you want to come, be there at 5:00 or thereabouts. I think we're supposed to bring crafts materials too, like markers and such. Check with Sarah if you really want to be sure.  Oh yeah, and tag the board or comment if you're coming so we know who to expect.  4. Doom 3 is coming out soon. You'll be able to tell by the day that everyone calls in sick from work.  5.  There's an excellent program that I've started using called Stickies.  They're like the Post-It's for the computer, except better.  Go  urlLink here  to download it.  Actually, there's another program called Stickies too.  I'm not sure which one is better, so  urlLink try that one out  too.  That's all for today. Enjoy the rest of your summer!
