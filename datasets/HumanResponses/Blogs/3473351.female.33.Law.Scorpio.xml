       urlLink    Traveling west on the North Bend Rail Trail I was thrilled to make it to the Silver Run Tunnel. This tunnel was misidentified at the bottom of this blog. THIS is the real Silver Run Tunnel and is reportedly haunted by a woman who would jump on the cowcatcher and ride to the next town. This is why I had come until I realized... gulp... I forgot my flashlight in the car four or five miles back. Silver Run Tunnel is 1,376 feet and its not even the longest on the trail.   urlLink

						   Saturday I had "a day." That means I was twice as caustic and toxic as I normally am. I was tired of sitting and looking at the four walls around me.  I had been invited to a Memorial Weekend picnic so I went to my friend's house. P.C.'s ex-girlfriend was there and I insulted her broccoli casserole because frankly it wasn't as good as his and I don't like her anyway. I don't think she got it as she had started drinking way before me.   Once I had a few beers I felt a little better and got in the pool which was butt-fucking cold. I swam around a bit and then got out and sit with my bud, J.A., and we sunned ourselves and shot the shit with everyone. But I was bored and tired and not really in the mood to get completely shit-faced so I came home. I laid down to take a nap and almost immediately fell asleep.   The phone woke me up an hour later and that completely pissed me off.  It was J.A. who had warned she would call to interrupt my nap. I didn't answer. I mentally made plans to bang on her bedroom window at 8 a.m. as payback. Suddenly, I could hear the dog barking, the lawnmower running, birds singing, water dripping and the second hand ticking on a clock I didn't own. SHIT!  I heard someone come onto Messenger and the sound of someone IMing me. It was the Beaufriend. I told Beaufriend I had to get out of this house.  The four walls were killing me. He had plans to meet a friend/business partner but said he would check to see if he could put it off and would get back to me.  Hmmmm...well that didn't work out and I sensed a blow-off. I hate that. I informed him I was getting the hell out of dodge.   I didn't want to go by myself but everyone was either tired, drunk or not interested and I thought briefly of making the 6 1/2 hour trip to Canada but figured all the bars would be closed by the time I got there which made the trip not only long and expensive but also worthless.  So, my second choice was to go to Point Pleasant, WV, about an hour from my house to see if I could locate the Mothman Statue.  It seemed like the thing to do at the time.  For those never fortunate enough to visit the bustling metropolis of Point Pleasant, WV, go at night. Its downright spooky.  The last time I was there was in college.  TNT as the locals called McClintick, the old ammunitions factory which was completely underground. There were igloos that came up out of the ground with spiral staircases leading into the vast government underworld. My understanding is they have since been uprooted and is now some kind of nature park.  The first time though they were still there and I got a glimpse of it.  The locals were all hanging out, drinking beer and listening to music and did I mention they don't like outsiders. They chased us out of there faster than rabbits fuck.  My "date" for some reason did a 180 in the middle of the road, oh, it must have been that car chasing us, and sped us back up the roads toward home. YIKES!  That hasn't changed much. As I drove across the bridge into the city I had the feeling that all the ghosts woke up. I'm particularly sensitive to those things. And having no idea where this damn statue was I drove around like a man not daring to ask directions. As I wound my way through the city I passed an old graveyard, making mental note to return, and groups of locals hanging out.  They immediately made me as an outsider. I wanted to tell them that one of my great grandfather's died on that soil in the first battle of the Revolutionary War and they could all kiss my ass.   However, using my keen sense of direction, I did find the statue of the Mothman and a wedding reception. Goes to show how odd the area is as they would have a wedding reception in an old hotel overlooking the Mothman. I walked along Main Street as intrigued by the locals as they were by me. The bridesmaids were tipsy and the other guests were weaving and singing like sailors. I sat for a while on the other end of the street behind the police station as youngsters staggered by me, obviously feeling no pain.   I made my way back down the street, hoping for an opportunity to inobtrusively photograph this legendary creature but the wedding party had moved outside and I decided I had caused enough of a stir.  Obviously I was the sober one.  The local young men hanging outside a pool hall were quite friendly.  One asked if he could "take a ride" with me. I told him I didn't feel like going to jail that night. He swore he was 18. I swear he looked 14.   That and the fact he had eyes like the Beaufriend stopped me from the need coursing in my veins to take him and taste the youngness of him and ruin him to any woman from now to eternity. I beat a quick path away from the Mothman and instead went to the cemetary and walked around getting my hem of my jeans wet in the dew, waiting for the cops to come by and ask what the hell I was doing in a cemetary past midnight.   I approached the bridge out of town with the trepidation that I had felt coming in.  As I turned toward home, the brown eyes of the young one followed me and Point Pleasant whispered for my return.

						   I've developed a knack for giving friends complexes over my complexes.  Something as simple as going down on my beaufriend can give me a complex. I'm one of those women who enjoys being between a man's legs, anyway I can. Since the yoni was out of commission for her monthly, I decided I really wanted to spend some "quality" time with my man.   Problem (?) is, he's all into pleasuring me, which is really a good thing when the yoni is in full swing and you won't hear me complain.  But, I do like to reciprocate and not because I feel like I   have   to but because I really just enjoy it.    But I think it gives him a complex, like he's so not deserving a woman who loves giving a blowjob and ask for nothing in return. I'm sure if any men are reading this you're scratching your head in wonder.  Me too guys, me too!!  How often does that come down the pike?  Not nearly enough is my understanding. I've had two men in my past tell me they have never gotten off on a blowjob until I got a hold of them....??? Now that makes me wonder, however, I do take pride in my skills and quite frankly, it turns me on.   So, beaufriend is now acting wierded out, and I think he has a complex about it.  Then again, I may just have a complex about thinking that he has a complex about it. Now my friends are complaining that I'm giving them a complex.    All this over a damn blowjob.  Hee hee, but it was worth it.

						   Hello friends and others...friends first since they will be reading this first and may be the only folks to read it. So, thanks to whoever you are.  P.K.C. I finally put some of my drunken musings in a public forum, check back for more after this weekend. It looks like it will be a wild ride.   For the rest of you..I have a kid and 9 cats. Not vice versa, I am still breathing and typing and yelling at the one kid. This is my extra-ordinary, and I do mean ordinary life.  You will find bits of wisdom here, probably a lot of drunken rants that I take for wisdom and a bunch of potty mouth talk that my mother would wash my mouth out with soap over if she found out.  I work in the legal profession. Contrary to popular belief and Erin Brokovitch's, not all lawyers are back-stabbing, scum sucking parasites, and I happen to work for the only 3 in the world who are not.  No one will be named by name, you learn that in a law office, but you may recognize yourself but its purely by coincidence.    I don't care much for stupid people and I make fun of them on a regular basis.  If this is you, pass the brain cell you've been sharing with the other members of your family and see if you can figure out how to nail jello to a tree.  If you think I'm stupid, you're brain cell is bouncing and you should drink a case of beer, shoot out the windows of your own pick-up and blow up your double-wide with your meth lab.  I do have a beaufriend...I'm sure you're feeling pretty sorry for him about now, but truly, I can be kind and loving, just not in the mood right now.  Want sex?  Anytime baby. Want kind and loving? Take a number. You really believe that out of a woman? What turnip wagon did you just fall off of?    You're probably feeling sorrier for the child...that would be my darling Hyper-Boy-Who-Hates-School. After 14 doctors and $25,000 in medical bills, not to mention that 14" head when he came out, gives me the right to call him whatever I want so get your finger off the speed dial to Child Services.  There is no child in the world who can tell a better knock-knock joke and he's so damn cute when he does it! He's 7 by the way.   His dad, now there's a Made-For-TV-Movie just waiting to happen. I'm sure you'll be hearing more about him later...no need to spoil the fun ahead of time.  And then there's my mother, who attempts to give love life advice although she's slept with and been married to the same man for 40 years and still cries that she doesn't know where she stands.  Again, I'll not spoil the fun ahead of time.    So, that's the introduction, I'll try not to be so long-winded the next time.  Welcome to Anything Goes.

						   You know its no wonder that America struggles with obesity.  I mean, they put the bloody cookie and crackers in the baby aisle, right there opposite from the diapers and the formula are the fucking cookies.  If the kids don’t want them then the parents definitely need them.   And let me tell you how I wandered around the store, in awe that I was there with 10 men, 2 of which I’m sure were “partners” if you get my quotes.  One fellow was looking at the cheese while I’m perusing the beer.  Taking out my handy-dandy cell phone which also has a calculator so that I may compute the cost of a bottle of beer.  It was 72 cents.  And I pay how much at a bar?  Oh, I think I’ll be staying home and drinking by myself more often.  Its more fun too. No need for makeup, nice clothes or even underwear AND I get to listen to the music I want to listen to.   Like Damn Yankees, Styx and Winger. “I was a loner, cruising with the wind, I wasn’t lookin’ when you put me in, I had to leave you like I always did, you knew damn well I’d come again.  Now I’m falling, where I’ve never been, My resistence is wearing thin, somewhere in the distance, like a long lost friend, oh oh oh, yeah a yeah ah, Lord here I come again. . . come again.”  Don’t care what anyone says, that’s a damn good song, 80's long hair or not. “When I finally get my hands on you, tell you what I’m gonna do, lay you down,  strip you bare, make love to you ‘til the morning comes around.”  Now that’s a goddamn love song!!  None of that exceptionally obscene Yanni shit or Celine Dion, “my heart will go on.”  Any girl who wants to hear that shit needs her fucking head examined because if a guy can’t throw you on the bed, rip your fucking clothes off and make you happy all night long I sure as hell don’t want him waiting for me at the end of the fucking movie on a goddamn ghost ship.  Oh, I forgot, he did rip her clothes off in a corset sort of way. Or was it she?  You know, I think he was tryin’ to be all noble, noble sucks, she has to look at him and say “touch me Jack.”  Or some stupid something like that.  What the bloody hell?    The best love stories though are the ones that include drugs and money like “Scarface” and “Blow.”  Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, yeah, I could love them.  Of course I wouldn’t mind taking a trip back to say the late 60's, early 70's because Robert Plant could really fill out a pair of hiphuggers.  And if he couldn’t? Well, I’d be more than glad to hug his hips for him, on my knees.  Yeah, he was HOT! Now, well, you need a relief map to find his mouth but hey, we all have our problems.   I digress, back to the grocery store.  I almost cracked myself up a few times because I kept wanting to break into song, like the Pirate Song and quote lines from Pirates of the Carribean.  (Rolling like thunder, from above I'll take you there, I'll take you higher than you've ever been before, Now come on, yeah, You've got to, Tell me how you want it (won't you tell me), Tell me what you want me to do - another fine love song from our friends Damn Yankees).    Once again, I digress.  Aside from wanting to call everyone “Captain” and “mate” I’ve taken to acting quite a bit like Jack Sparrow, the weaving part, not to mention the accent. Something between, oh I don’t know, French, English, Australian and Irish.  So, I’m walking around, seemingly lost, but I do have a rag tag assortment of shit in my buggy.  The mega super supply of toilet paper.  You know like 30 double rolls.  Its myself and a small child.  But hell, I figure everyone needs shit paper, shit happens.  And an 18 pack of Icehouse, which is supposed to be for New Year’s Eve, but I got an early start.   Now me, I think its fucking hilarious that I have all this party stuff, the little wieners, meat to make meatballs, deviled ham, cream cheese and crackers, the beer and this huge fucking package of toilet paper, oh and milk, because I needed milk.  I must feed the small child in my house milk you see.  Just 10 ½ more years and there will be more room in the refrigerator for beer.  Oh, you found me out, Mother of the Year material I am not.   Anyway, so, I get this feeling that I’m being “checked out” and not by the cashier.  He was your typical teenaged young alcoholic in the making with incredible dark brown eyes with insanely long lashes that I could teach a few things.  In other words you young punk, I’ve forgotten more than you’ll ever know.   And I know this because I’m a female, therefore I forget nothing and you being male forget everything not directly connected to beer, football, baseball, and basketball, in that order.  Of course you could be a little different, it could be beer, hunting, fishing and Nascar or any combination of the above.   I did feel sort of feel like the “odd man out” since I was the only female, until I realized in front of me in the checkout line was actually another female.  She could have passed for a man but I didn’t say anything. I just freaked her out by weaving my way past her to grab a magazine and I notice that dark brown eyed, incredibly long lashed cashier was away from his post and I looked at her, in a very Jack Sparrow sort of way, and I said, “ I suppose we’re in a holding pattern here, eh?”  Her eyes got very big and she didn’t answer, can’t figure out why.    So, I’m on my way to my car, keep in mind I’m sober and I don’t want to be.  I see a bunch of young persons, kids, hooligans, what have yous, hanging out and true to form, I don’t think first of my person, or my purse, I’m thinking, “I will stomp the living shit of anyone who tries to take my beer.”  And no, I don’t take medication for that, what’s that word? Oh, um, you know, paranoia.  I like being paranoid, keeps me on my toes.   I told you I’m in this Jack Sparrow mood. Well, if you don’t know who Jack Sparrow is then go and rent “Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.”  Actually I’m in more of a Captain Barbossa mood. And you don’t know who that is see the second sentence of this paragraph.  Anyway, I told my boss today that I was disinclined to acquiesce to his request.  He said “in other words you would like to be fired.”  I said, “on second thought, I would so inclined to acquiesce to your request with continuous gluteus maximus smooching.”  Never try to out-argue the man whose name is on the door, the letterhead and the mortgage.   I just finished my third beer and I’m trying to decide whether I want another one even though it is getting a little difficult to type. I mean, if I don’t, then I have an odd number of beers left.  That’s make me wonder about the synchronicity of it all.  Aye, it makes me wonder a lot of things.  None of which I should put in writing.  Okay, maybe I could put it in writing but then what would be the consequences?  Probably nothing, because I never get a straight answer anyway.    I think I’ll just smoke another cigarette.  I mean, cigarettes are fairly simple, you light them, you suck on them, they go away.  Which leads me to the conclusion that all cigarettes are male.   So, that was my trip to the grocery store, savvy?

						   So, my question of the week, of the month or of a lifetime is what is with the adage, “look on the bright side” or “look for the beauty in life.” What about the simple, stupid, and banal? If you don’t seek that which is commonplace what luck do you have to recognize anything above it?   Look at any issue of Cosmopolitan, one hundred and one ways to love your lover or leave your lover or cook for your lover or something along those lines. I must say that should come after the article entitled, “How to Spot a Clean Man to be Your Lover.” Let’s concentrate on getting one that doesn’t appall us the moment we’re done with the hoochie. This is the practical, and often boring, side of life but an important one.  What about navel lint? Should you really date a man with navel lint? Its logical if a man pays attention to that small, unassuming hole located in the lower middle abdominal wall and has no use whatsoever, then he’s going to pay attention to other matters of hygiene. I would also suggest paying careful attention to the toenails, as what part of the male anatomy is going to be looked at least, unless you have a fetish for such things.  With practicality comes boredom and a certain irritation for conversations that are as stimulating as watching paint flake. By that measure, we are all in the same boat, kinsmen in a rowing competition across the endless sea of life having nothing more to look forward to than death. I’ll not postulate about the existence of life after death, reincarnation, yin, yang, karma, and nirvana, let’s just stick to death, whether emotional, physical or spiritual, eventually it will happen and you may still be breathing.  No one wants to be part of the crowd or normal anymore, that’s why we compete, but in a race that’s going to end the same way, time after time. Imagine though if you were a kernel of corn, nestled tightly in your cob with a hundred other unfortunate blokes and you have been left to plump beyond full, losing your pleasing texture and sweetness, like Great-Aunt Rosemary who really let herself go after she whelped her third brat and now wears polyester and pets her facial hair over the soup. That fuzzy little moustache is going to be the last thing you see before she slams you into her buck teeth, ripping you from your moorings and if you’re lucky, you’ll dribble out of the corner of her mouth, onto her generous bosom, and she’ll remember you as she scrubs away your stain.  An ear of corn is a simple concept that can bring about the most banal of exchanges. Do you, for example, eat your corn side to side or around? Who cares? Who cares whether its named Silver Queen, Golden King, Queer Charles or Sister Mary Goldeneye? A farmer, that’s who. A farmer who would carefully explain the differences between the types of corn and why the Silver Queen suddenly developed a “goldeneye” kernel, which would be due to cross-pollination with a Golden King. Hanky-panky in the cornfield, makes me wonder what Indian corn cross-pollinated with.  What about the slogan “Dare to be Different?” That’s not really hard to do as we’re all different. How about, “Dare to be Mundane?” Some people would find it difficult to be ordinary and normal, your’s truly included. How would you classify something as “different” anyway? Think hard about what would shock you or you would deem to be “different” from everything else, the norm, if such a thing exists. Is simply being mundane different? Is watching sunsets and reciting the phrase, “red sky at night, sailors delight, red sky in the morning, sailors warning” as mundane or as different as looking for rainbows in oil puddles, playing in the rain or singing in the shower?   It seems as though everything has to have a purpose or its not worth doing. I disagree. I’m tired of looking for a forest in a book of matches, a wildfire in a candle flame, and love from a simple smile. I will blow dandelion seeds and expect to see dandelions, play in the rain and expect to be wet. I will find rainbows in oil puddles and recite stupid sayings at sunsets. I will pick ripe corn from the garden, and carve pumpkins at Halloween.   I will be boring and simple, commonplace and normal, banal and practical, just like always and the beauty and brightness, the difference it makes, will come with it.

						   Blondness overrode brains the first time I saw a sign that said "Signal Ahead."  To me, signal meant "to signal" as in, "which direction are you going dear?"  Of course it means that there is a stoplight ahead that may be hidden from view until that 20 miles over the speed limit you were going becomes a real problem when traffic is stopped 1/4 of a mile from "the signal."  I wish occasionally that little "Signal Ahead" sign would pop up in a dream or in the middle of the road on a tipsy night as a warning that your beloved is about to detour. I remember thinking as a child that "up" was "north" and "down" was "south."  Of course when your relatives live "down South" you can understand this bit of confusion.   Imagine you're puttering along on a nice easterly course, something like a tornado cutting through Kansas, when suddenly the newest love of your life cuts off the main road and begins heading south. Do you follow?  Does a bear shit in the woods? When a man has a sullen look on his face do you ask "what's wrong?"  Of course, like a lemming, you follow.  But where was the signal?  There are no signal lights on the road of love, bumps yeah, signal lights, NOOOOO.  Why is this?  Because we're inane when it comes to figuring the signals that others send us. We all have our own agenda and read that again if you disagree.   No, no, no don't hand me that crap about how you want the two of you to agree on your course of action. Be honest and admit, YOU HAVE AN AGENDA. You merely hope the other person's agenda matches yours or they may be sufficiently swayed, through sex or food or both, together, to agree with your agenda. That's why we can't figure each other out.  "Ah ha moments" aside, eventually you get the picture. And then its the same old boring "why didn't I see the signs?"  BECAUSE YOU HAD YOUR OWN AGENDA!!  Work with me here!  The signs are there, we just choose to ignore them. Then again, it could be like that drip, I seem to be a drip-magnet, the one that always slows down to turn onto to a different street, to go in a different direction and never turns a blinker on and that's me, the blonde in the black car, yelling, "SIGNAL!"    And while we're at it, back on that easterly course in Kansas, why wasn't there a witch of the south mentioned in "The Wizard of Oz?"  To keep you from going back to watch the film, you have the Wicked Witch of the East, the house fell on her folks, and we know the WWotW and Glinda, GWotN...South? Hello?  Am I the only one of thinks of these things?  See, I didn't signal...isn't that annoying?

						   Halloween was always a big deal and we prepared for it a week in advance.  Now some people were all into the rotten egg thing.  We considered that pretty lightweight.  Matter of fact, the folks running around egging houses and cars normally ran smack into one our roadblocks.  Now, anyone who was anyone on the holler knew to stay off the damn road at Halloween.  Most people knew how to avoid us, which was, take the “way-back-yonder road.”    We switched around from year to year so folks never really knew where we were placing the roadblocks.  Our roadblocks were made from just about everything but the kitchen sink and I think we even found an old one in the creek to use one year.  Mainly brush, tree limbs and even trees themselves, cut just enough that all we had to do was put our backs into it and they would spread themselves all pretty on the road.  And yeah, we put them in curves for the dumbass idiots going sixty drunker than shit.    This did not endear us to two distinct groups of folks. 1) The county sheriff and 2) State Troopers.  See, before you got to the 3rd holler, we always set a roadblock and had a squealer that would call or radio on a CB that the cops were at the first roadblock so we could hide or otherwise make ourselves scarce.  Which normally amounted to hiding on the mountainside and telling everyone to shush.  One year though, they got smart.  The squealer radios up. No problem, we hit the brush.  Ten minutes later the CB squawks again.   “Guys, guys!!  Hey!”  We’re all groaning about that loud fucker and wish he would shut up until he says, “GUYS GODDAMN IT THEY JUST PASSED THE FORK AND ABOUT THREE OF THEM SUMBITCHES JUST GOT OUT AND THEY’RE GOING INTO THE MOUNTAIN!!!!”  Can you say, “Oh Fuck!!”  We sure did.  It looked like a Chinese Fire Drill right there in downtown Appalachia. We popped out those mountains like a nest of rabbits in front of a brushhog.  Escape plan B.    The Big Mama, who was on our CB radio frequency, throws open the door and says, “Ya’ll better get yo asses in here!!!”  So, yours truly and seven other camouflaged, faced-painted heroes are cowering like sissies behind Big Mama’s couch, looking at each other like, “what was I thinkin’”

						   My eyes close, as I picture your face, Your scent falls around me, I am lost in your essence, Floating, unstable, Breath escapes in sighs, I sacrifice myself to you, Your lips grazing  the curve of my shoulder, I burn, turn in the darkness and miss you.   I'd like to think the Beaufriend is withdrawing from me because of his overwhelming love but instead I stand in front of the mirror and ask, "Are you being an idiot?"  "What compels you my dear to wade through this insanity?"  "Because I don't trust him." "Who don't you trust?" "Him." "Who don't you trust?" "HIM." "Who don't you trust?" "Myself"  Patience

						   That’s a lyric from the Dierks Bentley song “What Was I Thinkin’.”  I’m not a huge country music fan but that song brings back some great memories.  The lyrics and the MP3 are here:  www.hit-country-music-lyrics.com.  If you click on Top 20 List Dierks is #9 on it. When you click it, it brings up the lyrics and the song starts playing, at least on my computer.   My parents were pretty strict so naturally I had to find a way around that.  Which was hanging out with much older folks.  My 16 year old self would ride the school bus to C.J.’s who lived in a holler, off a holler, off a holler.  I’d change out of those prissy, sissy clothes my mom bought for me into jeans with more holes than denim, a pink tank top, camouflage jacket and shit kickers a 100 years old, cuz you never knew “where the night might lead.”  C.J. and D.E. would get home from work with a fifth of vodka and a gallon of orange juice.  C.J. was 6 years older than me and D.E. was 8 or 9. He had kids, course that don’t mean much around these parts.  Serious drinking would ensue.  We played drinking games and when we ran out of orange juice the vodka bottle would be passed to me. I was the only one whose liver was young enough to handle it. I’d shoot the rest of the bottle, which normally consisted of 2-3 good chugs. It would be about 10-11 p.m. by now and time to hit the dives.    No bar where I lived could be considered a honky-tonk. We weren’t that high on the food chain.  Hell, I doubt that two were even considered dives as most people there appeared to have dove and hit the bottom.  Bottom dwellers, shit eaters, scum suckers.  People who had a record a mile long, a couple murderers, bikers with bad, bad attitudes and guns.  We didn’t hang there, we just bought booze and left.  C.J. took care of me.  She was like a big sister but a lot more protective.  Never fear though, I had an attitude, a death wish and the balls to prove it.  When I got something in my mind, there was no stopping me, sorta.   Like the night I took off with J.W. and D.L.  J.W. was hot, hot, hot. Black hair and the bluest eyes.  He played basketball with my brother.  D.L. was a little pipsqueak who looked like a good wind could have blown him away who bragged about his massive cock. He musta been a grower.  I jumped in the truck with them, three sheets to the wind with C.J. and D.E. in hot pursuit.  Nothing like a drag race on a one and a half lane road.  C.J. and D.E. both had Mustangs so we got a head start.  We got to the turn off to the 3rd holler when I told J.W. to take the right fork, instead of the left.    He slowed down and looked at me, “Goll damn it girl, C.J.’ll kill me if I don’t take you home.”  “What?  You scared?”  He gave me that “you bitch” look but spun around into the right hand fork.  D.L. freaks. “Do you know how much fucking trouble we’re gonna be in man??  Do you know?? Fuck.”  We hightailed it up the holler with D.L. looking for headlights behind us, cussing a blue streak.  When J.W. pulled it over on an old logging road, D.L. jumped out.  “I want nothing to do with this!”  I did. I wanted everything to do with that boy.  The only light was from the dashboard but he had that look in his eye and ohhh, I know I did.  I am ready to eat that boy alive.  Then D.L. bangs on the bed of the truck.    “Headlights comin’.”  DAMN IT!!  I swing the door open and D.L. hops in.   C.J. pulls up, “Get ya asses down the holler.”  C.J. was the kind of person you just didn’t argue with.  I’m pissed, J.W.’s pissed and D.L. isn’t real happy either.  So, J.W. gets a wild hair, starts fucking around and ditches the truck.  Meaning, he fucked around enough to put it IN the ditch.  D.L. slides against the door and I slide against him. This is why I wear shit-kickers.  C.J. pulls up from the way we came and D.E. pulls up from the other direction.  J.W. pulls me and D.L. out from the driver’s side since we’re kissing dirt on the other side.   There’s no hope. Neither of the Mustangs can pull that bitch out and we’re not going to be able to push it either.  We split up and that was the end of that.   You may wonder why I let C.J. order me around. First, she was a big girl but second, I was wild as hell and damn ready to fuck my life up as completely and royally as I could in the shortest time possible.  A few years after that, she and D.E. sat down and had a talk with me.  They said I didn’t belong there and I needed to get out.  To hit the road and never look back.  I did.  I still fucked up royally but it was at least in a time period that I could handle it.   Next Time:  Halloween in the Holler

						   And I am a Co-Dependent and an empath.     Co-Dependency    I hate that word. I hate it! I hate enabler worse. Co-dependency has led me down a path of self-destruction and self-destructive relationships with married men, alcoholics and sometimes, both.  I trace this back to a childhood of emotional and physical abuse. Where I was made to feel responsible for someone else's happiness. Where nothing I did was ever good enough. Where I had to be the good child or risk the withdrawal of affection and attention, and still, it was never good enough.   Nothing   I did was ever good enough, ever.   I became an over-achiever while wallowing in a world that seemed to have no place for me. I had super-intelligence which propelled me into the realms of gifted classes. I was the youngest editor of the yearbook, winner of a writing award in which I beat out 200 other students from 55 high schools, I was the first and only exchange student, to date, from my school after winning a scholarship from the United States and Germany's governments, Governor's Honor Academy, Honor Society, soloist on two instruments in the band. Yeah, I did all that. That's me. None of it ever fucking mattered.   After the demise of my last relationship with the Drunk Boyfriend, a friend who is a recovering alcoholic gently asked me if perhaps I was co-dependent. I remember reading the characteristics of co-dependents with a sick, sinking feeling. An even deeper pit formed when I read the reasons behind co-dependency.   In a nutshell, but far from an entire explanation, is the need to focus on everyone around you and their problems as opposed to facing your own. We make excuses for the people in our life, we anticipate other's needs then wonder why they don't anticipate ours, we say yes when we want to say no, we're afraid of anger, our own and everyone elses, we will do practically anything to avoid confrontation, and we will practically do anything to avoid abandonment. We're obsessing, controlling and manipulative because we constantly feel as though we know what is best for other people.   That hurts. But not as much as it used to. First, I let my anger and hate towards my mother go. She was the root of the problem, my dad to a small extent, but mainly it was my mom. I love her and I feel sorry for her that she was raised in an environment that precipitated her feelings and her feelings towards me. I no longer allow her to manipulate me by her whining and crocodile tears. I turn her off.   I do a check-up, as I am now, to make sure I'm not backsliding into my old ways. Am I taking on other people's problems instead of working on my own?  Who am I saying yes to that I should say no? Am I obsessing? Have I asked for what I want instead of believing people should read my mind or pick up subtle clues as to what my needs are? Most importantly, how am I with Hyper-Boy? Am I allowing him enough freedom?  Am I using him as an excuse to not take care of myself? Am I being a hermit? (I'm always a hermit.) Am I okay? Am I happy?  What do I need to get there?  I'm still getting there.     Empathy    "Empathic people...have the ability to translate energetic impulses into emotional awareness. They  feel  their way through life, through decisions, and through relationships in a deepening and life-affirming way." In other words, I can tell what your feeling, draw those feelings out, filter them through myself and send them back to you, supposedly for your betterment.   Its hell on Earth when you don't know what you're doing. I've done this for years and never knew what it was. But instead of filtering, which may have helped when I was younger, I absorbed. I absorbed the emotions around me. I never let them go. I didn't know how. Until through chance I found a book that described what I was and how to deal with it.   Funerals are absolute Hell. HELL!! So many emotions I can't stand it. And worse, people in pain, in emotional pain, are drawn to me. Empaths are highly sensitive people, in tune to people and animals, plants, hell, you name it. Of course, some empaths are more in tune to one or two things than all things. For me, its people and animals. And don't think you have to be standing in front of me.  Empaths can sense your feelings over the phone, through e-mail, chat and personal letters.  And don't ever let one of us touch your hand. We will see behind your cover. You can't hide from an empath unless...you know how.     Co-Dependency & Empathy..OH MY!    One of the characteristics of a co-dependent is believing you know how someone else is feeling. I was damned confused for a long time on that. Not surprisingly, an unhealthy empath, one who has not learned to filter emotions instead of accepting them, one who has not learned to turn it off for some peace, has some of the same characteristics of a co-dependent. It may be part of what leads some of us down that path. I don't know.   I'm becoming a much better empath and a much worse co-dependent. I'm working on it.     Enter the Beaufriend    There's nothing better for an empath to have in a relationship than another empath. It didn't take me long to figure out that the Beaufriend was also an empath. And a damn good one too. But by also being an empath, I felt his emotional withdrawal from me at the beginning of our relationship and I called him on it. Literally, all is good and then WHAM! he's gone. I hated that. AAAGGHHHHHH!!!  I HATED IT!!!! But I also understood why, but it didn't make me like it anymore.   He controls his empathy better and gave me tips on how to "turn it off." I guess you could say I mirrored him when I felt like I needed to. I learned from his own withdrawal how to formulate my own. When my grandfather died, I learned from him how to filter other's feelings as he filtered mine. When I'm with the Beaufriend, I feel like I float. Its like two negative charges creating something positive. Literally, we can be in a crowded room full of drunk people, which are the absolute worlds worst to be around because their defenses are down and still find a moment of peace amongst them.  But I'm still co-dependent. With that comes a whole host of problems with the Beaufriend. No wonder he turns me off sometimes. Right now, I'm getting itchy. In other words, the dreaded feeling of abandonment is popping up. And I don't think its just me. The Beaufriend is good at turning some feelings off around me but he sucks at it when we're not together. He has the same worries and fears that I do. Just call us Barbie and Q when it comes to past relationships. I try not to let it influence me but sometimes the dread is so intense I just cry because I can't do anything else.   Then its back to the list. Am I telling him what I need? Am I keeping my mouth shut so as not to start a fight that I don't want?  Am I standing up for myself?  Am I expecting him to read my mind? Am I being used?   I have faced down some intense moments in my time with the Beaufriend. I lived in absolute fear of telling him that he hurt my feelings. I lived in absolute fear of voiceing what I wanted. Everytime I said something, I waited for the mockery and the withdrawal of affection and the manipulation to start. I steeled myself to break it off if that happened. I REFUSE TO LET SOMEONE TREAT ME LIKE THAT AGAIN!!!  Luckily, he hasn't.   We discussed before how when you're treated like shit you do one of two things. One, you vow to never treat someone else like that yourself or two, you treat everyone as bad or worse than you've been treated. We made a pact, I guess that's what you call it, to be together because we want to be, not because we're living in fear of what might come after. The Beaufriend has a way of reassuring me without being patronizing.      Self-esteem    I'm running on half-full here. I worry a lot about things I probably shouldn't. I worry about me and the Beaufriend because I love him dearly. I'm constantly caught in a battle between empathy and co-dependency, questioning always, afraid to fall back into the abyss. Sometimes, its a daily struggle. Today, has been a bad day. I think he's frightened too. I feel it. We're battling against the abyss, against fear. I think we battle too, not to smother each other. Unfortunately, this puts us at odds in love. To love is to suffer in our book. So, its baby steps. Its looking in the mirror and asking, "Am I being an idiot?"  I worry about Hyper-Boy too. He's one of the reasons I work so hard at this. While he may be screwed up, it won't be for lack of trying on my part to give him the best I got. His self-esteem sucks too. As I work with him, I work on myself. His father, doesn't help anything. I battle for Hyper-Boy on that front as well. Attempting to undo damage while not dissing his dad.     Blogging... Good or Bad?    Before anyone read my stuff, I wrote a lot but never posted it. Just like, well, the 5 diaries I keep. I don't write in them everyday and sometimes I write letters to people or to the Beaufriend and never send them, so I keep them as diaries too. Blogging is good. Its good because I've found people that I can relate to and hopefully can relate to me. I get lonesome sometimes, internally lonesome, emotionally lonesome because I tend to hermit (I am a hermit) emotionally and physically.   At least emotionally, I don't feel so alone anymore. I'm starting to pick up people's vibes through their posts which is a little... scary. I'll keep those vibes to myself though but not in me. I think blogging helps me sort things out and makes room in my brain for something else.   But blogging is addictive. I've felt myself sliding since I started participating in discussions etc. For someone used to puttering along in the Outer Rim, its frightening to be pulled into the galaxy, with so much to see, so much to learn, so much to feel. So much to distract me from me and my problems. But I love people. I love learning about people and reading about them because sometimes, it helps me understand me a little better. It also helps to know I'm not really alone.   Perhaps blogging is an exercise in which to help me learn how to filter, but not accept, to care, but not to obsess.  "The 7 Jewels of Co-Dependency" says "Its never wrong to love."  I really believe that. I just have to remember that love starts within myself, for myself, before I love others.   Damned, if that's not the hardest thing of all.

						   I am a Wiccan. Click on the title above if you don't know what I'm talking about or want to learn more. Interestingly enough, today's topic on witchvox.com is not living life as a victim. I'll post about that later.   I have a great love of religion and not just my own. I own 5 bibles, books on Judiasm and Jewish mysticism that is the "rage" in Hollywood, books on Buddhism, and just books on religion. I have yet to pick up a copy of the Koran but its on my list.   Whoever hasn't heard something about Islamic extremists in the past 2 1/2 years has been under a rock in the desert hiding from deposed despot Saddam Hussein. I harbor no ill will towards Muslims, no more so than Baptists or Catholics or anyone else.   I own an  Abaya  set. This is the traditional Muslim dress for women. Do not confuse it with a  burka . A   burka   is the head to toe covering with even the eyes covered. An   Abaya   is like a long dress with long sleeves that uses buttons, clasps or velcro to stay in place.  With it came a   shayla   which is a long oblong scarf not be confused with a   hijab   which is a HUGE scarf. Muslims believe a woman should be modest, hence all the covering.   I see Muslims practically everyday in the city that I work. We have a Muslim population large enough that they have a beautiful Mosque in the town next to mine. One Muslim that I know is Jamal. He runs a cigarette store. I went in his store one day before 9/11 in a brilliant red dress I own. He looks at me, raises his eyebrows and in his soft voice says, "I   love   America!"  (Smile)   I worried about him after 9/11.  Worried that people would come after him or his store. I did venture over to his store where he always watches cable news channels.  He and I stood and watched the news from Ground Zero. I asked, "well, what do ya think?" He turned to me and pulled his mouth into a frown, "I think, there are crazy people all over the world."  I think so too Jamal.   My aunt is very prejudiced against people who are not Christian. Her daughter, also a Wiccan but firmly in the broom closet, reminds her that America gives us the right to be any religion we want. My aunt responds with, "Yes, the right to be a Christian."  OY!   I don't blame all Muslims for 9/11. Nor do I blame all Christians for witch burnings, nor believe all Catholic priests are pedophiles. Let's be honest, any religion can draw freaks. Waco anyone? Nor do I believe I have the right to try and convert anyone away from their religious beliefs. Extremism, yes, their religion, no.   I worked at a portrait studio for three years, major chain. A few Muslim women would bring their children in. One in particular you would never know was Muslim. She obviously loved western culture. The other dressed in an   Abaya   and   shayla  . I was out the studio when this occurred so it is second hand. The typically dressed Muslim comes to the studio sans children and tells T.C. that she wants to get a portrait taken for her husband.   She also tells T.C. that she cannot look at her while she takes off her scarf. T.C. is like, okay, no problem and directs her to the back of the studio for privacy. I believe she also told T.C. that no one, NO ONE, can see her with her scarf off, even T.C. If I'm remembering correctly, T.C. argued that she HAD to look at her to take the picture and warned her that at least ten other people would see the picture during developing etc.  The Muslim woman appeared concerned and then decided to go ahead with it.   T.C. left her alone and the Muslim woman called for her when she was ready. She had taken off the   Abaya and Shayla  . She had on an ornate long sleeved blouse and nothing else. T.C. freaked. She explained to the woman that she couldn't just traipse around in our studio half nude. Now, this is a woman who didn't want T.C. to see her without her head covering on but is now half-nude. OY!! Her rationale was that she just wanted the picture from the waist up. OY!!   T.C. finally covered up her bottom with a drape and took the pictures. Naturally the pictures were flagged so when they came in we could see her. I didn't recognize her. She was gorgeous. A very naturally beautiful woman. Stunning. So, in that instant, I really understood Muslims a little more, at least the religion and the whole modesty thing.   So, when I see Muslim women out and about, I think to myself, "I wonder what she's wearing under there?"  Next Time: Hey Mom! Baptists are on the Porch!

						   I just read on Jay's blog, see links to the left if you haven't already checked it out and he stated in the comments section that "pussy is power and women have it all!!!!" Not sure if I got the number of exclamation points right, but I'm really, really tired.   I want to thank Jay for that comment and the comments that Seeker and I have shared about why the Beaufriend acts the way he does. I told Seeker that sometimes I feel like the Beaufriend is waiting on me to go postal on him. Wow, this all makes so much more sense.   Judging from the posts that I have read on a mulitude of blogs and "conversations" (i.e. running commentary on posts) that many women know that have that pussy power and choose to use it to get whatever they can. If you're a woman like that GET OFF MY PLANET!!!  Take a note from Zelda and stop holding out to get your way. Using sex (or no sex) in a relationship is wrong. Its degrading, demeaning and a huge blow to anyones self-esteem. I know this because guys have done it to me. If you're a guy like that GET OFF MY PLANET!!!    I love my guy. I don't care if he buys me a fucking Rolls Royce or picks a dandelion walking up the steps to my front door or shows up empty-handed, he's gonna get laid. Why? Because he treats me with respect, like a human being with my own thoughts and feelings, because he talks with me instead of at me and because he tries to understand where I'm coming from. He doesn't pay MY mortgage, take out MY garbage, take care of MY kid or mow MY lawn. I feel privileged to have someone in my life who doesn't steal the mortgage money from my checking account, then goes out and gets lap dances all night and comes home so drunk he pisses on me in the bed.  YES, that happened to me!   I feel privileged he's never broken my door in or felt up my friends. I feel privileged that he hasn't drunkenly tried to fuck me up the ass or called in the middle of the night to bail him out of jail. I feel privileged that he hasn't beat bruises on me or my child (otherwise he would be dead and I'd be writing this from prison.)  So forgive me if I don't whine, piss and moan about the fact that I haven't seen him in 10 days because he's been working 16 hour shifts. I'm grateful he has a job and keeps it. Forgive me if I don't pout and stew because he hasn't been able to say more than, "I miss ya babe and I can't wait to see ya when I can keep my eyes open...snore."  I'm grateful he's thinking about me. It means so much.   So if ya got a decent guy then treat him like you want to keep him. Men, don't treat your women like shit. Am I idealistic? You're damn straight I am!!  The Crazy Cat Woman from the Appalachians has had her say, now I'm going to bed. Good night.

						   This is going a lot longer than I intended but now that I've started, I'm not stopping. Everyone from my parents to the Beaufriend have mentioned that I just have way too many cats. I, at times, have wondered what the hell I'm doing and have thought about decreasing my population.   But I can't. I feel same way about my cats as my dad does his trees. They all have different personalities. If the subject comes up again I will challange the one who asks me to rid myself of the emotional and yes, financial burden of my pets to pick one thing in their life that gives them solace, that makes them laugh, that they love and look foward to and then I want them to give it up. Forever.   Financially, things are finally looking up (crosses fingers it stays that way.) I know within the next couple of weeks that I will be able to get M. & N. spayed. Then Napoleon, since he will be the only male left, will be neutered. In succession, his sisters will be spayed also.   I do realize though, that I'm maxed out. No further cats or other creatures will be welcomed into my home. I say other creatures because the Drunk Boyfriend brought home an oppossum one time. That was interesting!!!   Next time, I'll not be so long-winded and will be talking about my adventures with Baptists, Muslims and religion in general. That's gonna be FUN!!

						   I wanted a black cat. Naturally, the nabes cat came up pregnant AGAIN... small wonder there as she's NOT FIXED! I said if she had a black kitten I would take it. NOT SO!! She had three, two were black and white. Awww shit...frig, okay. I was really hoping they would be a boy and a girl. I wanted to name them Boris and Natasha or Gomez and Morticia. Sorry, both girls. So, they're Natasha and Morticia. They are twins, except for the toe on Natasha's left foot and the fact that Morticia also has allergies and is practically bald at this point. OY!  As things happen, my financial situation after the Drunk Boyfriend moved out, prevented me from getting M & N fixed like I had the rest. So, they became strictly housecats until I could get my feet back under me. N. has no interest in going outside, even while in heat because she's in love with Ozzy (and acts just like him.) M., unfortunately, made a beeline for any open door even when she wasn't in heat. It was also extremely difficult to tell when she was in heat because she wasn't a crier and whiner like her sister. Hyper-Boy and T.L.C. didn't shut the door after them and allowed M. outside. This is how we got Mongoya (rest his soul), Napoleon, Lola and Ireland. OYYYYY!!!   Surprise, surprise.  I always figured all the cats born of the calico (that's Hermione, M. & N.) had Siamese in them. Sleek, trim bodies and triangular faces. It wasn't until M. mated with her uncle, URG!, that it came out. Napoleon and Ireland look Siamese, except Ireland got her mom's white feet. Lola, hee hee, is black with a little bit of white on her belly. Mongoya, who is memorialized in an earlier post, was black and white.   Since Mongoya's death I have fought for the lives of the other kittens as they all contracted what he had. The vet has no clue what it is, just knows its not parasitic in nature. Luckily, he gives me a discount because we've had carnal knowledge of each other. I think (crosses fingers) that they are all on the path to recovery.   I also think I've given them a complex. I purposefully change the litterbox, the whole litterbox, not just scooping, when I have the time to stand around and watch them all come running to potty. Nothing draws cats like an entirely cleaned and disinfected litterbox. I stand and wait for each to take their turn so I can see how their bowels are functioning and if they need more meds or if its all good. I just laughed at myself for this (and I'm reminded of Seeker who has trouble with public restrooms and his own cat troubles. He's linked here so if anyone has made it this far check him out and make sure you go potty beforehand.)  Next:  Love, love, love

						   So, Smokey has now survived Ollie, Hobbs and the birth of Hyper-Boy. Hyper-Boy was almost three when I bought my house. I digress.  Our neighbors also had a cat that looked a lot like Smokey but he died within a couple of months of us moving here. Their next cat also died. Then they got two females. One was pregnant when they got her, and one became pregnant soon thereafter, despite being told both were fixed. Someone is still laughing about this.   I told them I would take one. ONE! I picked out a tan/carmel colored male, brought him home and named his Oscar or Ozzy. He hates practically all people. He only likes being petted for a very short time and then he's gone. He doesn't lay on your lap or anything, Mr. Anti-Social. Right after his litter was born (May 13th), the other litter was born (May 31st). Their mother was a calico. I wasn't going to get one until T.L.C. came over with this kitten, reminded me of Smokey, nasty, just nasty, not to mention, downright UGLY. He said, "If we don't find a home for this one we'll have to take her to the pound."  She purred, I was hooked.   I thought about naming her Sharon or Harriet since I had an Ozzy but since I had just read Harry Potter, she was dubbed Hermione. Hee hee, can I just say that nasty kitten is gorgeous now? Its very hard to describe her... medium long hair, she's considered a calico since she has tri-colored fur but she's striped like a tabby and big green eyes. She also have frigging allergies. YUCK! But otherwise, she's Ms. Love. She loves everybody, even the people in cars as they have to slow down because she lays in the middle of the road. She looks like a squirrel on stilts.   Next Up:  The Twins

						   People ask, "How did you get so many cats?"   The story of the cats. When I moved out on my own, I had to get a cat. I left Alex, or Boo-Boo, with my parents, or rather they threatened my life if I took him. A lady at work had a cat that just had kittens. Wha-la. He was a freaky mauve color with mauve eyes. I named his Oliver, or Ollie.   Two weeks later, I was back at the homestead, between the time that my parents moved deeper into the wooded abyss and they sold their house and heard a cat meowing. My friend and I found this tiny grey kitten under the azalea bush. He was pitiful. Flea-bitten, hair falling out, malnourished. UGH! I took this gray fuzz and got flea soap. ARGH! YUCK! NASTY! I washed him up good and when I poured water over him it looked like he peed blood. I combed what was left of his fur, he was one big flea, that's all. Fed him lamb and rice, he learned to lick water and then I wrapped him up in big beach towel and he slept for hours.   That small gray fuzz is now cock of the walk here.  (Ollie, even after being fixed, left, or was stolen, and never returned.) Smokey is a 15 lb. monster whose sole purpose in life is to rout my yard of any dog that dares to sniff a blade of our grass. He has medium long hair so he looks that much bigger. His first foray with my Lab, which I no longer own, was a scratched cornea and $200 in vet bills.    When I moved from my Tornado-bait (yes, there are tornados in the Appalachians and they do gravitate toward trailers) I had sort of adopted the cat next door named Hobbs. Yes, he looked like Hobbs, duh. The neighbor didn't like him because she hadn't gotten him fixed and he sprayed everything. But she didn't feed him either, scraps off the table. She also said that he was her cat and I couldn't take him with me. Fine.   Two days after they pull my trailer out, my other neighbor calls to say that Hobbs is still sitting on my porch meowing. (Sigh) I told him under the cover of darkness to stick him in a cat carrier and bring him down. I got his neutered and he and Smokey still sort of liked each other. I have say though, he had the worst kitty breath of any cat I've ever owned and never failed to want to stick his face in yours for love.   By and by, he too left and never returned. This leaves me with one cat, again.

						   There are several reasons why I do not drive an SUV.  1) I can't afford one. They cost almost as much as my house. At the current payment on my compact car it would take me 22 years to pay off a Ford Expedition.  It would take me 9 1/4 years to pay it off at my current house payment. It would still take 6 1/2 years to pay it off combining my car and house payment. It better come loaded because I'd be living out of that bitch.  2) If I can't afford the payment I sure as hell can't afford the gas.   3) I simply should not be placed in control of such a monstrosity, like most people who drive them.   I drive a Sunfire, 5 in the floor. I will not own a vehicle without a stick shift. Yes, I love the feel of the stick in my hand. I can't help it. Its as much an addiction as smoking and blogging. I love it.   I love horsepower. Not so much speed, as power. However, my good friends in the NW allowed me to get behind the wheel of their brand new SUV. Why? Because I was the only sober one. I was left in charge of my friend's brand new husband (I was maid of honor while I was there) and two of her brothers. I'll call them Brother Z, Brother B and Brother T and that SUV.   We were on the Columbia River, standing around the woodstove drinking, them beer, me water. (I had a run in with the best people and the best tequila I've ever been completely blasted on, but that's for another post.) When we got ready to leave I have to adjust everything as Brother B had been driving before. He's 6'5", I'm 5'3".  I followed one of Brother Z's friends out to the secondary.  When he popped up on the road he went into the oncoming lane. The Brothers are stoked, "He wants to race."  SHIT!!!  There's a fairly long straight stretch ending with a gentle rise blocking the view of oncoming traffic. I'm the type of person that when folks around me get stoked, fuck it, I'm stoked too. I now have three grown men egging me on. Fuck it. I punched that bitch. Brother Z is in shotgun and I see him go slamming backwards. I now have tunnel vision. I'm not looking at anything but the open road and am only conscious of my foot laying on the gas pedal like I'm squashing a bug the size of Washington itself.   I lay that bitch wide-open and she's gaining that wild momentum like the crazy woman behind the wheel.  We smoke that wannabee.  Just one small problem and what I don't know, is... the onramp to the Interstate is right over that little rise. Brother B and Brother T don't know this either because, like me, are not from WA. Brother Z knows this though. He takes up the call first, "We gotta turn! Slow down!"  Bitch is still wide open.   Brother T and Brother B sensing impending danger also take up the call, "Shit! Slow down! Slow down! We gotta turn." I'm coming down from this massive power high and see the turn myself.  In a split second I know I'm going to flip this bitch unless... I slam on the brakes, throwing the Brothers against their seatbelts (I think someone lost a filling) and the moment I execute the turn I punch it again, knowing if I don't I'll lose traction and... oh well, that didn't happen.   I blend it with Portland/Vancouver traffic while the Brothers sit in shocked, stunned silence.   Brother T, we call him Tweeker, also for another post, is the first to break the silence. "And you're the fucking sober one?!?"  Muuahahahahahahhahaaa.  This is why I don't drive an SUV. Be very glad.

						   My Family and Jesse James  I am the family's resident genealogist. I am aware of how many times I am my own cousin. Big deal. The royals did it, we did it, oh well. Appalachian Royalty has a certain twang and we don't have one eye in the middle of our forehead or hemophilia.   There is a family story, passed on by my Great-Great-Grandmother Julie (Ma-Ma's side). Now G-G-Grandma Julie was about the same age as my Great-Grandmother on my Pa-Pa's side, so she wasn't really THAT old in relation to the rest. She did live to see great-great grandchildren born, just like my Pa-Pa.   The story is that Julie lived with her mother in Pikeville, KY in the late 1800's. Supposedly, her mother ran a boardinghouse in the area, Jesse James stayed there, or rather they hid him while on the lam, and he tipped my g-g-grandmother $50 for bringing him a meal. Now, I'm inclined to believe it was $5 which probably seemed like $50 as she said she was 6 or 7 years old at the time.   Other family genes have discounted this story because supposedly Jesse James was not in that area at the time. Julie was not the type to make up stories of that nature so I was leaning toward Julie. (Now, I never knew her personally, I'm only going on the character reference of my grandfather and grandmother) I dug around and dug around in archives and such looking for clues to Jesse James whereabouts during this time frame.   Finally, I found what I was looking for. I was reading stories on www.crimelibrary.com.  Its my thing. Yes, I read about serial killers and the mob and outlaws. It serves me well. They have a section on Jesse James which is fairly long and involved written by a Civil War buff and BOOYAH! There it is in black and white... he went through KY in August of 1876. Julie would have been 6 or 7 years old at the time as she was born in August 1869. My family were conferedate sympathizers, even though they all deserted, and in old stories were linked to Quantrill's Raiders.   This doesn't prove that Jesse James and my g-g-grandmother ever crossed paths. But it doesn't disprove it either. I'm naturally more inclined to believe the family story, with a grain of salt, that we aided and abetted one of the most notorious outlaws ever. I'm so proud...sniff... does anyone have a tissue?

						   I finally figured out how to post links. Although I'm too much of a squib to know how to put the actual title "Links" anywhere. I know I have lurkers out there so its really for them since, well, we all sorta know each other anyway. And if not, well, the links are there. Ummmm... now I linked all these folks and now I don't know if I should have.  Do you ask someone if you can link them?  Or do most people just asked to be linked?  I noticed Zelda linked me, I'M SO PROUD!!!, and she didn't ask, but then, that is Zelda and Zelda is awesome.   Here is it: If I linked you and you don't want to be linked to my site chances are you'll never know anyway since you don't read my blog. Problem solved.   For all others, it is my pride and pleasure to present to the lurkers the opporunity to read your blogs and become addicted as I have. May you have calluses on your ass as I do!! CIAO!!

						   The Beaufriend is on the road again. This time its an "alternative" shop... in other words a sex shop masquerading as a music store because they sell CDs.  Here are the top 10 reasons that he should buy edible/flavored lubricant/massage oil:  10. 	I’ll go half on the price  9. 	It has less calories than Wesson oil  8. 	Its less expensive than Olive Oil  7. 	It will taste better than baby oil (hopefully)  6. 	Friction, friction, friction  5. 	A good reason to shower together afterwards  4. 	The slicker, the hotter, the better  3. 	The sweat will bead on our skin  2. 	The boss will slide between the upper frontal prizes easier  AND, THE NUMBER ONE REASON IS....  1. 	My ankles are more likely to make it to your earlobes... YEEEEEHAWWW!!!

						   I answer phones on roll-over at work. That means the receptionist is stuck with someone and the phone ring and rings. Its a chance you take picking it up, afraid it might be that client you've been dodging. I usually try and disguise my voice.   Today, I got a guy who said, "I gotta sort of a wierd question." God, I love these. He says, "I was divorced in '98 in Florida," immediatley I'm thinking, "Good, I'll refer him back to Florida." Bad me. "Well, my ex-wife called to let me know her dad died and the estate is worth a couple million dollars." Ooooookaay.   "Now, why would she do that? Her dad and I were always on good terms."  Be damned if I know mister since you called a law firm instead of a psychic hotline, but I'd try like hell to get back in her good graces. "Well sir, perhaps you were named in the will."  "I didn't think of that."  Damn, but I did! "Me and him were always close. Just because I divorced her don't mean I divorced him."  oooookaaay  "Sir, did she just call and say, 'hey, my dad died, he's worth 2 million?'"  That'll teach ya for divorcing me!  "No, no, matter a fact, we talked for 4 hours and cried together.  See, she never got along with her dad very well,"  So much for the inheritance, dump her! "And I broke on through to the other side,"  Whooaaaa, serious 60's drug use here causing him to channel Jim Morrison, "so it really patched things up with them."  Awwwwww...  "Sir, I think maybe since you and her dad were so close that she wanted to talk to someone who loved him as much as she did. She needed to make a connection with someone who would understand what she was feeling,"  I am SO good!   "Yeah, yeah, I think that may have been it." Then why the fuck did you just waste 5 minutes of my time?  "Thanks for clearing that up for me. I really appreciate it."    Not a problem, Thursdays are always my most psychic days.

						   How does one be romantic without being cheezy? Or are they the same thing?  Beaufriend's b-day is coming up. Wanna do something nice, laid back but not cheezy and schmoozy. I got him a 3 year subscription to  Popular Photography  magazine. Its the gift that keeps on giving. It also means if he dumps me he'll be reminded of me once a month. If that's not romance, I dunno what is.

						   I was hoping I would see the bitch that works at the law firm down the street from me this morning. I woke up with cramps and a headache. Somebody needs to pay. This woman is just like my mother. It appears she never steps out of the house without each flyaway hair lacquered into place. She walks like she's trying to keep a marble between her butt cheeks. She would drown if ever caught in rainstorm. Snotty hag.   She has been the object of my ire since she made a racist comment about a good friend of mine. My friend is very small statured and this bitch didn't see her behind all the people over 5 feet tall in the elevator. I haven't liked her since and I'll never like her. I imagine that she only has sex in the missionary position and fakes orgasms a lot because she's so frigid no man could last long enough to defrost her twat. She probably has sex on a towel too, you know, to soak up the condensation.   She's thin but hangs out with two fat women. I think this is to make her look good because after they get off the elevator she makes fun of them. I keep hoping she trips and falls face first into a parking meter. One day I'm going to help that along.

						   We're huge Lord of the Rings fans around here. (I have the books in English and German.) I was sitting in the Control Room one day, one ear cocked to hear the conversations in the living room. T.L.C. was being a butt. A real butt. Hyper-Boy was putting up with this. (This was pre-"Fine go home then") I am boiling but stay in my room. Suddenly, a phrase from "The Two Towers" springs to mind. "Stupid, fat hobbit." And I repeat it over and over in my mind in Gollum's voice. I am ashamed.   I am afraid something will happen to T.L.C. At this rate it will. Its called drugs and mischief. It may happen to mine too. No one is immune. But there's no reason to give it a head start. Its hard to impress upon someone that children need us MORE as they grow up, not less. Its just a different kind of need. They need supervision, guidance, rules, consequences and love. Love most of all.   I wonder if something did happen, whether death or consequences of choices, that they would miss T.L.C. Would they miss the way freckles pop out on his nose during summer?  Would they miss his white eyelashes against his sunburned face?  Would they miss the silly songs that he sings? Would they miss the way the boys get excited and hyper when playing video games to the point where even I join them (and I hate video games) as T.L.C. shouts directions at Hyper-Boy... "no, no, right there! NO! Speed up, right through there!! That's it! That's it! YOWWWZAAA!!!" And they stand up and high five and shake their butts going "oh yeah, oh yeah, uh huh, oh yeah."  Would they miss the way he sticks his tongue out while playing Gameboy?   Do they notice enough to miss anything?

						   I can't forget the month of the talent show. T.L.C. talked about it endlessly. Hyper-Boy has stage fright, unlike his mother. Every morning, every evening, T.L.C. talked about it. One morning I hear him coming across the lawn between our houses. I hear him because he is bawling, sobbing. I meet him at the door and ask what happened. His dad lost his permission slip for the talent show. He won't get up to take him to school to sign another one. T.L.C. is angry. I console him the best I can, wanting to go over and drag his father out of bed and tell him his child is worth more than a goddamn 1/2 hour of sleep.   I reassure T.L.C. that I'm sure he can still be in the talent show.  I almost go in and sign the damn permission slip myself but I know the school knows to call his dad at work and get verbal permission. This is a normal occurrence.   When his parents go out at night, they don't really ask me to babysit. They call to let me know that he is home alone and will I be home in case he "needs" anything. There is no difference in this and asking me to watch him. I remind them that I put Hyper-Boy to bed at a certain time and T.L.C. cannot stay here. That's okay, they'll be home at 10. I said TEN. I stay up, afraid the house will burn or I won't hear him if he cries or calls. Most nights it is 11:00 or 12:00 or 1:00.   This is neglect. I know this. I am ashamed that I do not turn them in. My other neighbor who watches Hyper-Boy is ashamed too. We are the worst sort of people in the world. We know everything and do nothing. We try to lead by example. What kind of example are we if we do nothing though? Who are we to dictate how another parent treats their child?  He's fed.  He's clothed. He has a roof over his head. He's not beaten nor abused. Or is he?  Do not think I am a saint, for I am not. No matter how sorry I feel for him, sometimes he just downright gets on my last nerve.

						   I have often heard my mother say, “She doesn’t love her children anymore than I love mine.”  Is that true?  How can one equate love?  It is but an emotion.  Is it self-righteous to assume that you can love more or better than someone else?  What is love?  Elusive definitions.   The lonely child lives next door.  T.L.C., ironic isn’t it?  My home is very small, less than a 1000 square feet. When you walk in the front door you are in a living room.  To the right is the kitchen. Straight ahead at the end of the house is Hyper-Boy’s room, to the left is the bathroom. To the right is my room.  Before my room is the computer room/laundry room/3rd bedroom/junk room.  The living room is large, which suits me.  When T.L.C. comes over I stick my head out of the computer room (We really call it the Control Room because this is where the Woman in Charge hangs out) and I can smell him from across the room.  He smells of male cat piss, crap and rottenness.  He is 9 years old.  He will be 10 in August.  He’s cute although overweight.  He’s very good at video games and loves to sing.  He’s very selfish because he’s an only child and his mother believes that because he’s an only child he should be selfish. Its just how only children are. Bullshit.  (Here come the comparisons) My son is not an only child.  His father has two other children from his two marriages.  His brother, S.W., is 16 and his sister, A.W.,  is 11.  They live with their mothers.  Hyper-Boy and A.W. see each other every other weekend and sometimes she and her mom come to visit us or we go visit them or I pick up A.W. at her grandparents house on the weekend when the kids are not together.  (That’s a whole nother story)  But, for the most part, Hyper-Boy is an only child.  I do not allow him to be selfish.  I do not allow him to blackmail other children to get his way. T.L.C. used to be good at this.  He would tell Hyper-Boy he was going home unless X, Y or Z was not done.  Hyper-Boy always gave in.  Sometimes this worked, sometimes it didn’t and if didn’t Hyper-Boy would come crying to me. It broke my heart and I asked him again and again, “why do you let him do that to you?” “Because I want someone to play with.”  Good answer, same answer, over and over. So, I finally shut up. One day I heard the same ole, same ole start.  I heard T.L.C. say, “Fine, I’ll just go home then.”  I heard Hyper-Boy say, “Fine, go home then.”  I pumped my fist in the air in silent jubilation.    Hyper-Boy comes into the Control Room and asks, “why does T.L.C. have to be such a butt?”  How do I explain a child that receives no guidance nor attention?  T.L.C.’s mother leaves very early for work so his dad wakes him up in the morning. T.L.C. gets dressed and ready for school.  No one tells him to have a good day, kisses him goodbye or tells him that they love him. If he rides to school with me and Hyper-Boy I tell him to have a good day.  He comes home to an empty house.  Now that its summer, he stays home alone although he wants to go to his old babysitter’s.  His parents say they can’t afford it. They can afford to drink and party but not hire a babysitter.  They make roughly twice what I do and have roughly the same bills.  I can afford it.   His mom has told me she never wanted children.  He was standing in front of her at the time.  She equates this by saying, “but I love the one I got.”  Okay, can we just stick to the “I love the one I got”?  His grades are abysmal.  I know this because he left his report card at my house.  His mother complains because the school wants her to work with him at home. She says it is their job to teach him, not hers.  Obviously.  I interject as best as I can the importance of being involved and helping where we can.  “Its not my job,” she says.    T.L.C. gets angry because Hyper-Boy can read better than he can.  He got angry (jealous?)  because Hyper-Boy went on a special field trip because he had gotten his Accelerated Reader points.  He told Hyper-Boy to stop bragging.  “Its not nice to brag about stuff when other people don’t get to do it.”  I told him, gently, that Hyper-Boy was not bragging, he was merely relating his day.  Hyper-Boy was not saying, “Ha ha haha ha, I got to go and you didn’t.”  I would have knocked out that loose tooth he has for that.  He was just excited about what had happened.   Later, I told Hyper-Boy, who has enough trouble at school that I’m thrilled when he gets kudos for his work, that he had every right to be proud because he had worked hard.  He had every right to talk about his accomplishment.

						   Here is the quote I mis-quoted in one of my posts.  "We are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be, whether we find them attractive company or not. Otherwise they turn up unannounced and surprise us, come hammering on the mind's door at 4am of a bad night and demand to know who deserted them, who betrayed them, who is going to make amends. We forget all too soon the things we thought we could never forget." --- Joan Didion

						   All my kitties had stinky butts, as in toxic farts, which the vet attributed to the food I was feeding them. They all seemed to have picked up a tad of what killed Mongoya. They have been pampered. I bought the Science Diet for Sensitive Stomachs. The good news is... they're not pooing as much and no toxic farts. Bad news is... its because they're upchucking. "That's whatcha call ironic." Kudos to whoever can tell me what movie that is from.

						   You might wonder what kind of relationship Hyper-Boy and Sperm Donor have now. Hyper-Boy has taught me the meaning of forgiveness and grace. I still have moments where I absolutely loathe the ground his father walks on. However, I will not say anything bad about his dad to him or around him, nor do I allow anyone else to. Even when Hyper-Boy asked me why his daddy was so mean. Hmmmm...  Hyper-Boy was afraid of his dad and he didn't like him very well for a while. Stands to reason. Duh. Once his dad did what he had to do, got off most of the drugs and half the booze, took a few anger management classes and actually talked to me without calling me a bitch, they were allowed to see each other again, slowly. They both tried. Hyper-Boy loves his dad and tells him so. He hugs and kisses him. He wants to buy him gifts for Father's Day and Christmas. His love is big. His forgiveness is huge.   Hyper-Boy has a gentle spirit encased in a blow-out body. He's sensitive, especially to suffering. I watch him grow and mature and I'm proud. He's worked so hard and accomplished so much. He's risen above many times.   When he was born he came out pitching a fit. When they laid him in my arms I looked down and said, "Hi Baby." He immediately stopped crying and looked at me like, "Oh, Hi. So you're the Mommy, I'm so glad."  When he awoke after his tonsillectomy he looked at me the same way but this time he said, "At least I didn't die." Talk about being reborn.   I wrote this poem about him early last year while we were still manipulating his meds. It reminds me of how far he has come. Happy Birthday Hyper-Boy, Mama loves ya!!!  Lonely Child Wandering	 	 Overwhelming light	  and sound cacophony, endless voices  He looks from  side to side trying to mend  frayed ends  of conversations to coherent thought  Movement   of lips of hands  Of sneakers squeaking  eyes following too many gestures  He is frozen  in confusion I touch his shoulder  to guide  to commiserate  to give  Field Trip money  and the lonely child wandering looks out through my eyes

						   Hyper-Boy is the sweetest kid. I don't think he really has a mean bone in his body, ornery, oh hell yes. Mean, nope. He sometimes gets mouthy, not normally with me but lashes out verbally at other people at times. He's actually learning to stand up for himself now as before he would bend over backwards to have a friend and took all their crap along with it. He's learned when he's wrong to just shut up and take punishment like a little man.   For those who have never dealt with an ADHD child, they are very impulsive. They don't recognize danger very well and if they do, they really don't care because they are always looking for stimulation. They also talk out of turn and say things they probably shouldn't. Most of this is kept under control with medication. I said most. He did call his dad a bitch once. (Sorry, I could not keep a straight face on that one.)  I've learned as much as I can about ADHD and seizures. I know how the medicine he takes affects his body and his brain. Because I have educated myself, I also know when he's completely bullshitting me. I'll say, "Hyper-Boy, what is the deal man?" He'll say, "my medicine hasn't kicked in yet." I say, "Hyper-Boy quit bullshittin' boy." "Mommy, you shouldn't say the bs word." "Hyper-Boy shouldn't try to bs the Mommy." He'll laugh and quit whatever it is he's not supposed to be doing. He's still a kid and he still does kid stuff, normal kid stuff.   What I've learned from Hyper-Boy probably exceeds what I've been able to teach him... by a long shot.

						   Its almost Hyper-Boy's birthday. He'll be 8. No, he's not going on 28 either. He's male, remember?   I love this little fella. He's so proud because he weighs 55 lbs. now. Trouble is, he's 4 ft. 4 in. tall so this still makes him a beanpole. He's got the biggest blue eyes. Girls will swoon.   Some of you have probably heard that in the last months of pregnancy babies don't move as much because they are too big. WELL, no one told Hyper-Boy that. His 14" head ground away in my pelvis for a month. He never slowed down, always rolling. He weighed 8lbs. 14oz. He wore 0-3 month clothes for about a week. He never could wear those cute little shoes that matched the outfit. Huge feet this guy.   The great thing about this is that he was a very alert baby and ate more than say a 5 pounder would. He nursed 40 minutes, 20 on each side.  Too bad he didn't sleep much though. We hated life together his first 3 months. He sensed my malcontent I'm sure.   I realized a few things by the time he turned 3. One, he was really smart. Two, he was really hyper. This is a horrible combination.  Kindergarten was hell. I mean hell. Double hell. His dad was so fed up with his hyperactivity and with his own life he took to beating Hyper-Boy finally to the point of leaving bruises on him, which I found. The dad's girlfriend finally clued me in to rest of the stuff going on behind my back when sperm donor couldn't watch him because he was too fucked up. Pills and booze, booze and pills.  Then I'm the pariah because I filed for full custody. I cut off visitation. I told sperm donor to get his life together or get out of our lives completely. He yelled, threatened, got a real fancy bitch lawyer that I know bugged her husbands's office and had to resign the judgeship... she knew me too. And I got the Family Court judge I wanted, who also knew me. That's just the way it worked out. The God's smiled on me. I didn't have to do much anyway. Once his lawyer saw the pics I had taken which were the perfect outline of her client's hand bruised into my baby's bottom, I pretty much got what I wanted.   Now, sperm donor is much, much better.  He knows his limits in dealing with Hyper-Boy.  They are very low.   Hyper-Boy has had 14 doctors.  He takes two medications, one for seizures and one for ADHD. They help. Unfortunately, the folks at his school believe these are miracle drugs that will turn him into the perfect robot. Nope.   Now, I've been stuck between a rock and a hard place. I pretty much didn't spank Hyper-Boy for a long time. After what his dad did... well, what can you do?  Therapy, therapy, therapy. For both of us.  Hyper-Boy developed a roaring case of anxiety. He wet the bed until he was 6. He was angry and moody. School suffered, home life suffered. But little by little, he pulled it up. The worst part of this, is he knows he's not like other kids. He realizes he is different.  His mind never, never stops.   The school nurse, his teachers, day care providers etc. have told me at least once, "he's always thinking, you can see it in his eyes."  Yep.  His newest therapist, who is awesome and the best I've yet to meet, and I outta know, says this is why Hyper-Boy has such difficulty with drawing and writing. His mind cannot light on one subject, it flits and flits and flits and when he finally decides on what to write or draw then it has to be perfect, it has to fit a certain criteria.   This is why we are practicing writing over the summer, not to mention the two E's which were made completely out of giving up and laziness. He dropped from A's to E's... this is not a medication/medical problem, this is laziness, this is giving up. This calls for desperate measures. No Harry Potter movie until he applies himself.   Further complicating this is his learning capabilities. He learns very, very fast. And once he learns it, its learned, lets move on. He hates repetition. HE HATES REPETITION!!  What do they do in 2nd grade, repeat, repeat, repeat. Hyper-Boy is one of the youngest in his class. He reads like an 11-year old and writes like a 5 year old.  I understand his frustration.

						   This is from earlier...  I GOTTA RANT!!!!  "So, this client calls me bitching and complaining because his claim hasn't settled and the insurance company hasn't called back. I try to be understanding with these folks, I really do. But he is so offensive its hard to feel sorry for him. Its hard to tolerate him at all. I cringe when I hear his name on the intercom. I tried explaining that 1) Its vacation season, people are out of the office 2) They are under no obligation to give you money before they go on vacation 3) Even if they are not on vacation, their boss probably is 4) He/She is also under no obligation to give you money 5) the southernmost part of our State, which is 2-4 hours away, is under 2 feet of mud from recent flooding. This means people are living with friends, relatives or in unsanitary conditions and have lost everything they own. This sort of takes precedence over your complaning just because you hate this state and don't want live here anymore. (He's not from these here parts.)  In short, they would rather give money to folks who continue to live here and deal with the environmental hazards left behind by the great coal companies after they have lobbed off entire tops of mountains than to you, a sniveling, whiny, belligerent fuck who only wants what's coming to him and to hell with the rest of us in this pathetic state.    So, while I wish they would make it much worse on you, I'm inclined to pray they give you some dough so you will shut the fuck up and get the hell out of my state. And don't let the door hit ya where the good Lord split ya!!"  And then I thought, because that's how I am, besides the fact that he said he never wanted to come back here again, that it may just be the tone of his voice. Some folks are born with nice voices, like Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Gene Autry. And then some people aren't. I have a client whose always sounds mad, even when she's not. (Think Dirty Harry) Its her accent. She's not from these here parts. She probably thinks we all sound like a scene from  Deliverance  or  Wrong Turn . I know a lot of people who do but they're uglier.  But then, I'm just an inclined to admit he's a sniveling, whiny, belligerent fuck who doesn't meet the neighborhood criteria for wife beating, incest, junked cars in the driveway, and coonhounds under the porch.  He just doesn't feel as though he can live up to the expectations of this great state so he's decided to hightail it on outta here before somebody really irritates him by inviting him to join the volunteer fire department.   Those good folks slogging through two feet of mud, selfishly taking up all of your claim adjuster's time, will gladly wave good-bye.

						   The reason I wanted to get that particular book for my dad is because of a conversation we had. I had gone morel hunting (this is type of edible fungus masquerading as a mushroom) and my dad had followed on his four-wheeler. Due to his numerous problems, the silicosis and asbestosis are only the tip of the iceberg, he doesn't walk the mountains much. We rode around together on the 70 acres they own. Those 70 acres are the reason my dad's body is worn out. Those 70 acres are his life-long dream.   Its a working farm with 25 head of cattle, 6 cats and more wildlife than you can shake a stick at. There are gas roads all over the mountain so four-wheeling is easy. There's also timber, good timber, and lots of it. Estimates of its worth are six figures. A lot of the timber is veneer quality, that means there are no knots or limbs in the trees. The poplar canopy is 30-40 feet. That's where we stopped to look for morels, in one of the poplar groves, the canopy soaring above us.   My dad, who probably has the first penny, nickel, dime, quarter and dollar that he ever made (don't spend your principal!), who worked like a dog his whole life to provide for us, who was the first in his family to graduate from college, who bought the farm not just to be a cattle farmer but also to harvest the timber, stood under those trees and said, "I just can't sell my trees. I just can't do it."  I said, "Then don't Daddy."  How can you sell something that owns you?

						   The book I got my dad for Father's Day was called "The Trees in My Forest" by Bernd Heinrich. Okay, he actually doesn't have it yet because Books A Million I'd Never Buy didn't have it. I don't guess it mattered much because my dad was way under the weather yesterday. Way under.   My dad, who I still call Daddy to his face and always will, whose father lived to the ripe age of 85, is probably not going to make it that far. Statistics state his life expectancy has dropped by 12 years. ]My dad has asbestosis overlayed by more severe silicosis. This is thanks to the time he spent in the shipyards for the Navy. It is also thanks to the major grocery store chain he worked for which exposed him to asbestos insulation in the warehouse and silica dust at the railyards. Thanks so much.  My dad is old-school Republican. He wasn't around much when I was a kid. He worked, all the time. And when he wasn't working, he was a weekend warrior in the Navy Reserves. And when he wasn't working or playing soldier he was taking college classes. And when he wasn't doing any of that he was hunting, fishing, working with a civic organization, mowing grass... etc. etc. I got him two weeks a year when we went camping.   My mom is not the kind of woman who could handle this. My mom is co-dependent and raised me that way, which I have fought against for the past 7 years. Because of her unhappiness, she talked frequently and poorly about my dad. And I resented him as much as she did. Naturally, we didn't see eye to eye.   When I left for my year abroad in Germany, that all sort of changed. My dad wrote me one letter, one personal letter while I was there. My dad worked midnights at that time and he told me he would take Boo-Boo, my hateful black Manx, and go upstairs to my room to sleep (no phone up there) and would think of me and wonder how I was. I'll never forget that.   When I came home, my mom started again, the complaining about my dad. After going a year without that experience it suddenly struck me full force. I took it about two weeks and I finally told her, bluntly, to shut up about my dad. She admitted much later that she knew that she had interfered in my relationship with my dad. I missed some years though.   It really came to a head when I became pregnant. I was unmarried but my son's father was not. Yeah, big mistake. My mother had a field day. She worried about what everyone would think. I heard what a disappointment I was over and over again. She refused to come to my baby shower. I was left out of family photographs. Every dig she could dig, she dug. And dug and dug and dug. As hard as she could. The aftermath is another story.   But although I know my dad was disappointed, he never said anything to me. I guess he figured my mom more than made up for his silence. When I would go to their house, he would meet me at my car. He would ask me if I was okay. He would ask me if I needed anything. Then he would go. He never did this in front of my mother less he suffer her wrath for showing compassion.   Through all this, I don't take sides between my parents. I understand my dad in ways my mom completely and utterly misses. Must be those genes. They say that sons and mothers are more alike genetically, as are fathers and daughters. Don't I know it. When people see me with my mom, they think I look like her but then they meet my dad, and they say, "oh no, you look like your dad."  Nah, not really. I just act like him and that's what makes us look alike.

						   In the wake of the death of our beloved kitty Mongoya, I almost forgot the day before.   My son has a gazillion doc appts. (maybe that's an exaggeration but sometimes it feels that way). I, being Ms. Frugal, decided to have the Sperm Donor drop his off at my office so we could walk to the hospital which is 5 blocks down and 2 blocks over. Like the rest of the US past NV, we've been having some major thunderstorms. But, the sky was clear.  So, we walk down in mid 80 temps to find the office had no A/C. Ugh. On the way back I notice the sky has that eerie-its-gonna-rain-like-hell look. We made it two blocks before the sky opened up. The wind was howling. I took my sandals off because they make my feet slide and not really made for running like hell. Hyper Boy is psyched. I'm worried about being struck by lightening.   In two minutes we were soaked. We made it to the post office where we stood up against the wall and watched 60 mph winds whip between the buildings, which I have to admit was pretty kewl. The whole barrage lasted maybe 5-7 minutes. Then the after storm sprinkling started. Hyper Boy and I hit every puddle on the way to the pharmacy. Who cares? We were already wet and I had on a black dress so no one got a show.   Hyper Boy was thrilled to see Mommy splashing in puddles while corporate kiss butts walked by in their posh suits, black umbrellas and hair-spray. I haven't used a worthy amount of hairspray since Mile-High Hair went out.   The water was warm, my son gleeful. It was great.

						   I just noticed that Part I posted between my other posts prior to these since it was a draft. Sigh...   Anywho, he's tough to figure out sometimes. Like I said, not a sunshine blower. Definitely cautious. So, I'm stuck being dead honest about what I want in the hopes that if I'm going to scare him off it just happens and we move on. Like the Evanescence song "My Immortal"   and if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave...  these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase   As our time goes on, I begin to believe that although time cannot erase some of the pain we've endured, it makes it easier to bear.  The painful reminders make us grateful for the things we do have. A painful past is just that, painful and the past. You can only learn from the past, but you can't live there. Its over, its done, gone, it can't be changed. Its the butterfly affect. Change one thing, you change everything.   I wouldn't be the person I am today without it. He wouldn't either and I think he's finally realizing that. He hadn't come as far as I had. Do I think I've "healed" him? No. You can only heal yourself. He's still scared out of his wits. Me, I'm just scared. But I'm not afraid. Does that make any sense?   I refuse to not give myself over to something simply because I'm afraid I might lose it. I think he's getting there. Its less of a toss up now. Before, it was. The hope vs. the fear. The chance of incredible love vs. the chance of incredible pain. There's a quote that I can't remember but here's the just of it: "I'm still on speaking terms with my past because I don't want it to come banging on the door of my subconscious at 2 a.m. demanding to know who's going to make it better, who's going to make amends." (Will post original quote later when I find it)  That's him, that's me, that's us. We're not perfect, nor glamorous, we've got our problems, but we also have a lot going for us. I really like us.

						   So, I don't recall if the beaufriend and I met in college or at a bar. Same difference. I knew him, he knew me.   He had left the area for quite some time but I knew he was back around. I hadn't seen him though until December. I went to visit my friend A.Z. and he brought him over to my table so we could "babysit" each other. I was so excited to see him because, well, I'd always liked him. We talked about our travels (he lived in Ireland for a while, I lived in Germany), we discussed politics (anti-Bush), past relationships (they sucked), how long we had been single (him, about a year, me, about a year and a half). Then he asked me the question that raised my radar through the roof. "Do you think you'll ever get married?"  Huh?  I tripped over that question like a stuttering fool. Do I think? Who knows. Its not like I've had so many quality offers. I'm a difficult person. With the Brittany Spears and J-Los of the world, what does marriage really mean anymore?  Obviously more to the homosexuals in Massachusetts than those ladies. If I ever walk down the aisle I want it to be understood that we're stuck forever. Realism not idealism.   (Don't get me started) Anyway, we didn't talk for a month. I finally worked up the nerve to call him.  Now, here we are.   I'm not a happy camper this evening. He's working, which is fine, except this particular aspect of his job makes it necessary to work in a "gentlemen's club."  (HI KEVIN!) Broadcasting live. Geez. Its unsettling. Do I think he's getting free lap dances and blow jobs? No. Do I think he's chatting up every abled naked body in the club? Absolutely. Do I think he's enjoying this?  In some ways, no, but in some ways, yes, but he'd never admit it because he knows it would hurt my feelings.   I know it all has to do with my own insecurities. My past and the fact that I love him. That I'm in love with him. The fact that no matter how hard I fight it, my mind turns to something permanent and I'm getting that slow vibe from him too. We've both been here before. When you begin to believe and trust that this is forever and you get the shit slapped out of you. But somehow we keep moving forward.   The fact is, I don't want my man looking at bodies more perfect than mine. LOL! My body isn't what it used to be since Hyper Boy was born. I'm not Pamela Anderson Lee. Okay, maybe the boobs and the hair, or something close, or so I like to think!!  Hahhahahhahha. And I know that he loves my brain as much as he loves my body. Its a balance. And I love his body too. He's not perfect in the eyes of society but he's perfect in my eyes. LOVE IS BLIND FOLKS!!  He's got broad shoulders like a line-backer and I love football, not as much as him, but I do love it. (I also love hockey!) We don't like being bored therefore the bedroom action is intense, sweaty and a hell of a good time. I think his hair is longer than mine but I tend to forget that he even has long hair. Except for weekend before last when I came so hard I lost all sense of time and what fucking planet I was on and ended up with my hands tangled in it so bad I thought I was going to pull it out by the roots. Luckily he said I didn't hurt him.   I've noticed too that he doesn't take much stock in what people say if they don't follow through. I told him that the folks I work with have been encouraging me to go to massage school. I have naturally strong hands I suppose and empathically know where it hurts and how to make it feel better so I offered him a massage. His response after a few minutes was, "wow, you are good at this."  ???  YEAH!  I guess he won't believe what a good dancer I am until I get one of those removable poles and show him. Hmmmmm....

						   I really don't like people sometimes. And its not the ones I deal with. Its the ones that people have dealt with before they get to me!  I have a client who was an inmate at one of the fine correctional facilities in my state. He suddenly began suffering severe headaches for which they gave him Tylenol. He was sent back to the population 3 or 4 days in a row. On the 5th day or so, he was scheduled for a parole hearing. The parole board took one look at him and made the prison transport him to a hospital. He had suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage and eventually a stroke.   It happens. But when they eventually released him from prison, he was transported to our city, 2 hours away from his hometown, with no money, no transporation, no home, no job, no nothing. So, they want him to stay out of jail??  Ridiculous.  Plus, he's disabled. The hemorrhage damaged his short and long term memory. He can no longer remember how to read or write. There are certain words that he simply cannot say or cannot remember. He also interjects the word "motherfucker" in every other sentence. When he becomes agitated it is more pronounced. Its not loud, more of a low mumble, but its there. He apologizes the first time he meets someone because he cannot control it.   Finally I was able to irritate enough people to get him some benefits and his parole officer got him transferred so he could live with his sister. I just want to know how our great state thought this guy was going to make it?  He admitted that he would steal before he went hungry, he would run drugs again, before he went hungry. One side of his body is paralyzed. What the fuck was our great state thinking?   I also had a guy call me about Social Security benefits. He had questions. They all have questions. These particular questions were not in my area of "expertise" but I looked them up anyway and tried my best to explain the government fucocktomy (thanks A.Z. for the contraction) of Social Security. This particular question revolved around offsets due to permanent disability Workers Compensation benefits. This gentlemen received a small annuity payment from a Workers Comp injury. Yes, it would offset his SSDI.   They called back three times with more questions and to update me on their case. They are not my clients. They are just people. The wife calls back today to tell me that SS said the annuity would not offset SSDI because it was a commerical annuity purchased by the coal company. Why didn't they say so to start with? No, it does not offset SSDI. She called to confirm this with me because she did not trust SS. People whine to me all the time about Social Security, Human Services and Workers Comp...news flash..they don't care!!! Yes, they are supposed to but mainly their job is to deny you benefits.   The wife thanked me profusely. And then she said, "You are the only person who tried to help us. No one else would talk to us." I guess I should have felt good about that, I did in a way, but otherwise I was just sad that they ended up with a paralegal busier than a one-armed paperhanger in a bad mood as opposed to someone who is paid to help them. I can't help it though. I hate to see people get screwed.   I'm reminded of a conversation I had many years ago with an acquaintance who is a police officer in the fine city I work in. They had launched a nationwide search for our most famous homeless person, aptly named after the song by Jethro Tull, Aqualung. I wondered aloud why they would put themselves out like that. After all, the man had a right to move if he wanted to.  "We were worried", he responded, "is his life any less important to us because of his social standing, of where he lives, of how he lives? When we dehumanize others, we dehumanize ourselves."  The city later rescued him from a mental hospital in another part of the state a few years back. "Hey, we want our most famous homeless person back!" We got him. I see him in the alley, going through the dumpster. I see him laying in the doorway of a closed establishment. I see him pushing his cart along the streets. If I want to give him something, I leave it in the dumpster at the end of the alley because he will take nothing from your hand. I know he likes Westerns. I also know he used to be a lawyer.

						   Sissy and I went to lunch at the mall. I hardly ever go there. One, because I just hate to shop unless I want something specific, which I do. A really cool looking halter top which will make me look in the mirror and go "damn girl, you lookin' good."   Sissy is addicted to the chicken teriyaki at the Japanese place so I tried it out with her. Really neat that they make it in front of you. I saw a girl that reminded me of Lindsay from Freaky Friday, the one everyone has been commenting on...did she or did she not have a boob job???    I guess she may be a late bloomer because I remember falling asleep an "A" and waking up a "C" but I was 12 or so. And they didn't stop there. Oh no, why would I ever have the joy of being able to wear a bikini that fit the top AND the bottom. If I had a J-Lo butt, everything would have been cool, but alas, I am all top and no bottom. I had quite a cute ass in '96, if you could overlook the rather bublous protrusion on the front of me.  When my pregnancy ended, so did my ass.  I had to deliver medical records in the afternoon about 40 miles away. The State Police were running radar on the Interstate.  They were stationed about 2 miles apart on the way down. All in SUVs with antennae like octupus arms. Some were K-9 units, which are really sweet looking vehicles...my tax dollars at work.   On the way home I passed a trooper at mile markers 26, 28, 32.5 (three were having a discussion beside the road in those really hot looking BDU type uniforms of the drug enforcement unit, yum!) and I passed another at mile marker 36 or so. The bummer was that the ones at 26 and 28 passed up a stranded motorist in the West bound lane who had been there when I went through. Its 87 degrees, with 63% humidity, so it feels like 95 and on the roadway it must have been 105 or so. None of them stopped to just let the guy sit in the air conditioned comfort of one of those fancy SUVs until a wrecker or the Welfare on Wheels came to his rescue. (WOW is the Welfare to Work program where people drive around and help stranded motorists)  That pissed me off. SERVE and protect fellas. Now, don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for police officers. First, I went to college with a lot of folks who are now officers. One of them died in the line of duty about 5 years ago. He was a good guy. Hyper Boy's father was a cop. I watched it tear him apart, I watched his slow decent into hell. He's no longer a cop. Troopers around here have a bad rep though. Brutality, being assholes, but damn they look hot in those uniforms.   I got home and found my lost cat. She has a bad cold or allergies. She's always sneezing but its much worse now. She's not eating so I went to the store and got canned food. If a cat can't smell, it won't eat and they lose weight fast. I've been wiping her nose like a kid. For some reason she's been giving me dirty looks. She didn't eat much but she ate a little. I'll try again in the morning. Maybe I'll wait until after she sneezes...YECH!!!

						   I just want to say that I'm useless in relationships. I suck at them. Well, I used to suck but things have gotten better with the Beaufriend. I love this guy for all the right reasons.   There's a lot of things I like about the Beaufriend. He's not stuck up my ass all the time for one. We have our thing and then we each have our own thing. This was freaky wierd at first but I like it. Not to say I wouldn't mind spending a little more time with him...but, whose to say that may not increase over time. I'll either deal with it or I won't.   I also like the fact that he doesn't talk my ear off after sex. Kiss my back, snuggle your sweat-soaked body against mine (its not real sex until both of us are drenched) but don't talk my damn ear off. I got nothing to say, I said it all with my body bud. I get real jangly after sex, it gives me a high and if I don't just lay there and chill I'll be up and ready to run a marathon for hours. And what a sweetie, he's actually learned to wait out the 10 minute, 5 sec, 2 millisec rule for showering afterwards.  And I didn't even have to say anything.   He's not a sunshine-blower either. He's not constantly telling me how beautiful and hot and what a(fill in the boring blank) I am. So when he does say something I know he means it. He told me the other night "you look so beautiful and are incredibly hot." Then he went home because he was tired. Huh?  He told one of my gal pals that I was "awesome."  I can handle that. The last time he said anything like that was in January when he called me "adorable." I still have the e-mail.  He didn't try to get me into bed the first, second or third date, nor the fourth, fifth or sixth. Took him three weeks to kiss me, three more weeks to kiss me with tongue and two more weeks after that to make "the move."   We're into music, politics, travel and photography. He's very intelligent and passionate about the things he believes in. I'd like to think I'm one of those things he believes in. He's a Cancer, I'm a Scorpio, water signs and what he calls "emotionally complex."  I know he perplexes me. He told one of my buds that he was "scared." Join the crowd. His history is as bad as mine. I think I'm incredibly lucky to have found him again.   I say again because we've known each other for 10 or so years, or rather, known of each other. One thing he has told me is that back when, during our "early years" that he thought I was "cold." ME? Maybe I was. I thought he was adorably cute at the time and he intimidated me because of that. But that was a harsh, cold time in my life and I do not look back on it with fondness. (And wherever you are D.S., I hope you get necrotizing faciitis of your dick. I hope you rot in the your own hopeless, degrading hell. I hope if you ever set foot in prison they all know what a disgusting excuse for a human being you are. I hope they gouge your eyes out for ever looking at me. I hope they fuck every orifice of your body until you pray for death. I hope death is slow.)

						   Here in the legal business, it occurs that clients die. I don't have a bad track record. I've been a paralegal for 7 years and I've lost 4 clients. Two murders, one suicide and one from natural causes. Maybe those statistics are not so great.    The first murder was a young woman 8 months pregnant who was on the wrong end of a drug deal. They killed her and her boyfriend execution style. The other paralegal I worked with at the time and I actually went to the funeral. The fetus/baby was in the casket with her and looked just a like a baby doll. This girl's son and my son were in pre-school together, although her mom had custody of the son.  Small town Americana sucks sometimes. Someone in NYC probably wouldn't have this problem of knowing everyone's business.  I also drive past the house where she was killed every day.   The latest murder happened on Saturday. Our clients, who lived in a trailer up a muddy hollow, either cooked up some bad meth and fed it to each other, although we believe the wife offed him then tried to make it look like an accidental OD on her part. She lived. The deceased's mother called to tell us as the wife was still having her stomach pumped. They need money for the funeral. Sorry. The wife called yesterday to tell us she had walking pneumonia.  Guess she didn't know the mother-in-law had already called to tell us the truth.   Sissy, my boss's secretary, my partner in crime, her fiance is a mortician in the county where this happened. He called a buddy of his who is a friend of the daughter of the sister of the deceased to get the story. Nothing is sacred. Someone said he was knocked over the head, someone else said he had blue stuff coming out of his mouth and someone said, nah, he was just blue cuz he was dead. We believe it was murder.   Our suicide was a lady who was despondent because her case wasn't going as well as she would have liked, became depressed, bought $4000 worth of Christmas presents and then shot herself in the head 3 days before Christmas. I went to high school with her daughter. She lingered but eventually died around the 26th or 27th. On the one year anniversary of her death, her husband, an alcoholic, tried to commit suicide by cop by shooting up the bar he frequents. No one was injured.   Interestingly enough, the one who died of natural causes was a key witness in the above lady's case. He was in prison where she worked. She was a nurse and he was a partial parapalegic or something from a gunshot wound. He also had kidney problems, which is what killed him. He was a nice sorta fellow. He never gave me any problems.   Next time I'll tell ya about the One-Brain Cell family that I've mentioned before. Thanks to all those who have read my blog.

						   April 6, 2004 - June 12, 2004  Mongoya was the runt of the litter. He didn't know that though. The first time I picked him up, he meowed loudly. Anytime I tried to sneak the new kittens away from their mother he would meow and give us away. I called him "loud mouth" and swore I would give him away as soon as I could. HA!   Hyper Boy fell in love with him because he was the only one that looked like Morticia, his mom, which before Goya was born, was Hyper Boy's favorite cat. Mongoya was the first to open his eyes. He never had any problems with his eyes like the other kittens. Anytime you looked at him you were greeted by these bright, bright eyes. He reminded me of Hyper Boy when he was a baby.   Goya was the first to walk, the first to find a way onto the waterbed, the first to dive for the nip when Mommy laid down. He was the first to die.   He developed diahrrea last Sunday. He lost complete control of his bowels. I began the force feeding of kitty Kaopectate. I researched feline diahrrea and found that most of the time, there is no known cause and no known cure. How disheartening. I fed him a bland diet of chicken and broccoli. This is how I found out that some cats love broccoli.   He was well enough by Wednesday to scale the couch and dive feet and head first into my broccoli cheese omelet. He growled like he had never eaten before. This seemed to have restored his appetite and I monitored his food intake and made sure he was drinking. On Thursday though, he had backslid. I noticed his stool had become loose again. He followed me everywhere and wanted to sit on my lap or shoulder.   Friday evening, he sat quietly on my lap and even on my shoulder. I had seen him eating and drinking earlier. But when he sat on my shoulder, his feet were cold.  He was never a big kitty. Always the smallest of the bunch. He was now skin and bones. I watched his eyes for signs of dehydration. There were none.   Saturday morning, about 1:30 a.m. I walked past the couch to turn off the lights for bed. He was dozing with his mother and his brother and sister. He raised his head to look at me.   Later in the morning, I heard Hyper Boy go outside and I got up and followed him. He went in the house and brought out Goya's sisters. We talked to our neighbor and then went inside to fix breakfast. I was in the kitchen when I heard Hyper Boy. He said, "Mommy!  I think Goya's dead."  I turned to find my him holding Goya's limp body. I took Goya from him and the wailing commenced. My boy was devastated. I was too.   I had seen the signs of impending death. I knew his body was too little. But I denied it. Had it been his older brother, Napoleon, he probably would have survived but he was just too little to start with. Now that I think about it, Goya never seemed satisfied. Although he ate as much, or more, than the other kittens, he never grew like they did. I don't believe he suffered. He was too vocal to have allowed that.  I believe in the warmth of his family, his soul simply drifted away.   For such a little fellow though, he had a large personality. He greeted not just myself and Hyper Boy at the door like dog, he also wagged his tail like a dog. He greeted my neighbor when she came to do laundry and demanded love. He followed us like a dog, always demanding love. And we gave him love. I miss his little body sitting on my shoulder as I sit at the computer.   He was the first to purr. I remember dipping my hand down beside the bed and feeling his tiny two week old body purring. I was in wonder that something so small could be so content. He was spoiled and rotten. For me, I am amazed at how that little loudmouth that I swore I would give away the first chance I got, wormed his way into my heart and then broke it.   I haven't lost a pet to death since 1994. I take that back, I have. Boo-Boo, my old black Manx that lived with my parents died a few years back. But he was old and had lived a good life. Ivy was my chocolate lab. I had to have her put to sleep at the tender age of 3 due to throat cancer. I haven't loved a pet like I loved her since...until Goya. Ivy was headstrong and hyper and tested my patience until I thought I would pull my hair out.   When I had Hyper Boy and year and a half after her death, I was amazed at how much alike they were, especially as Hyper Boy grew older. He too has tested my patience again and again. She was good practice. I can only wonder if Goya wasn't practice too. A pre-cursor to what may come. A little loudmouth that drove me to distraction, but who only wanted love and attention. And when he got it, he was quiet and content, loving and peaceful.   66 days is not a long time to be upon this earth. For us, it might as well been 66 years.  He was born with personality and spunk. He loved us and we loved him. He never wanted for anything while he lived. He shall never want for anything ever again. If he ever feels hunger, he'll eat broccoli and cheese.   For their part, his mother has sulked all day.  His siblings have stuck close to me and Hyper Boy, as though trying to fill his void. As though they grieve with us.   Our dear Mongoya entered this life April 6, 2004 and departed over the Rainbow Bridge June 12, 2004. He is survived by his mother, Morticia, his brother, Napoleon, sisters, Lola and Ireland, his Aunts Natasha, Hermione, Kumba and Timbers, companion kitties, Smokey and Ozzy and by us, his human family. We love you.

						   Life takes interesting twists and turns. I went back to Point Pleasant after being snubbed by the beaufriend, which is fine, everyone needs their sleep. It was okay, took one of my friends with me. One that will listen to me whine and bitch about the beaufriend. One that won't let me get too discouraged, jaded and cynical about love.   Otherwise, I have no choice but to be wary of marriage in general. I have watched the demise of too many of my friend's marriages. The latest victims are J.A. and her husband. There is nothing I hate more than to sit with a friend while they lament about the state of their union to the point where I'm almost certain for them separation, at a minimum, is inevitable. The culprit -- money.  J.A. and her hubby make a little less than I do, each. Their bills are comparable to mine for the most part except they have one more adult in the household. They use my washer and dryer because the water backs up in the washer and the dryer is on the fritz. J.A. is using a car that will no longer be legal at the end of this month and won't pass inspection. Her other vehicle is broken down. The one that does run now has a flat tire. She refused my "fix-a-flat."    J.A. is unhappy because she had $21 left from her last paycheck, and $16 from this one. She gets paid once a week. She gives $200 a week to her hubby and pays bills herself. You know as well as I that $20 won't give you a full tank of gas. Hubby spends about $1000 a month at the grocery store. They probably have 14 bottles of ketchup in the fridge because he buys a new one everytime he goes. He spends about $50 a day on groceries. I spent that for a week of groceries for me and Hyper-boy.   She tried talking to hubby...he won't take her suggestions. I didn't want to tell her my suggestion, which was, my way or the highway buddy! So, I didn't. The only advice I gave was, Put your foot down and keep it down. I would boot his ass. I've lived without mate for too long. I try to remember this is her marriage, not just living together, a marriage. They have a child. I know there are two sides to every story but being privileged, an insider, I have two eyes, I can see. I know she is right.  She feels controlled by poverty when there should be none. She realizes things should be much, much better.   Frankly, they should. I've finally got my own finances balanced as much as possible and I'm praying I have the fortitude to keep them there. But, if I can have a little left over and I'm one...I see her point.   She admitted...only she can change it. She's a Scorpio so change normally happens at the end of a long inner battle and the fallout is intense.  There are no reinforcements to call in. It is what it is.   On a better note, the beaufriend actually showed up to meet with me and a couple of friends, just for a few minutes but hey, progress not perfection!

						   Just when I thought I would get to work early... some numb nuts has to dump a load of metal on the Interstate. That was westbound, I'm going eastbound, so I think "no problem."  This is a problem. Traffic is backed up for miles in all directions. I am the queen of backroads and normally that's where I head when traffic problems crop up. Alas, I was drawn into a sense of false security by mere directional analysis.   I hate sitting in traffic. Its boring and tedious. I wore a callous on my finger from changing the radio stations, trying to find something that wasn't some talk show, in other words, wow, I wanted to listen to music. I finally flipped over to an older rock station in the extended area, which I can get on a clear day, with a full moon and Venus getting ready to eclipse the sun, and was rewarded with the tail end of the one of the greatest rock songs ever written, IMHO, "Jane" by Jefferson Starship (Airplane?).   Which is right up there with Bob Seger's "Night Moves" and Billy Squire's "Stroke Me" although "Everybody Wants You" remains an absolute favorite. Then I'm reminded of "Man on the Silver Mountain" and "Stone Cold" by Rainbow and "Show Me the Way" and "I Don't Need No Doctor" by Peter Frampton, which reminds me of W.A.S.P...Live in the Raw, they do a cover of "I Don't Need..."  Shuck me, suck me, eat me raw, this is "Harder, Faster!" If you haven't heard this CD it is well worth the money if you like that sort of balls to the walls rock n roll. Not AC/DC by any stretch of the imagination but the musical arrangements are quol and Blackie Lawless always made me want to take my underwear off and do the nasty.   Speaking of musical arrangements, the Scorpions with the Berlin Philharmonic puts Metallica to shame.   This is why I hate sitting in traffic and would rather drive 20 miles out of my way so as just to keep moving. My mind moves too quickly to just sit. It must be engaged. That's what I like about the Beaufriend.  He's intelligent and passionate about his beliefs so he debates a lot.  He's informed not just a rattle-trap. But most importantly, when he touches me, everything is still except the merest of breaths and the beating of our hearts. Its as though we float a foot off the ground and leave the chaos of life behind. And my mind is chaos.

						   For once, my ultra-Conservative mother and me, her ultra-Liberal daughter, agree on something. This all started when my ultra-Bitchy S-I-L called to let my UCM know she had been diagnosed with gestational diabetes. She's due with my third niece or nephew and just to be the ultra-Bitchy Aunt-in-Waiting, I hope its another boy. She and my Prick Brother (such love, such love) have two of the most adorable little boys, no bias there, they really are just beautiful boys. Except, they teach them nothing. Hellions doesn't come close to describing them. Additionally, they are just mean: biting, pinching, punching, kicking, back-talk and not just to each other, but everyone.  (Sigh) And not to mention that my UBSIL wanted these kids SO bad and now won't teach them a damn thing and only half way watches them when they are out and about, all the while sneering down her nose at my Hyper Boy. Yes, hyper, mean, not on your life. Not that he doesn't get mad and want to kick someone's ass, he's that much like his mother, but he's a soft-hearted chap and no match for his cousins.  Enough background, on with the show. So, my UCM invites them down (with gritted teeth) for July 4th before the possible C-section, etc. My UBSIL informs her that they will be attending her sister's lesbian wedding and that her grandchildren are in the wedding.   (Head in hands rubbing temples) My UCM believes that gay/lesbians are born not made but does not agree with their lifestyle. I could care less. The only gay I've ever met that I didn't like was a heterophobe. The others I know, and yes, work with, are just other people to me. Their sexual orientation has nothing to do with whether I like them or not, except in the case of the heterophobe who didn't like ME because I wasn't a lesbian.   Having said that though, I have to agree with my UCM that I think a 5 year old and a 3 year old never exposed to gays or lesbians are mature enough to understand why A.J. is kissing A.J.G.  Had they been around A.J. and A.J.G. and this was a normal part of their upbringing, like thousands of gay parents who have children, no big deal. My son has never seen me kiss a woman, nor has he seen a man kiss another man. He has only seen a straight relationship and that is what seems "normal" to him.   I don't think at 7, almost 8, that he cannot understand the sexuality issues involved, simply because he's never been exposed to it. Knowing my 5 YON, he will say, right in the middle of the ceremony, "Why is A.J. and A.J.G. kissing?"   Do I believe that different sexualities should be discussed with children?  Absolutely. I plan on making it part of the "The Talk" when my son is older and able to understand heterosexuality, homosexuality and bi-sexuality. That day is right around the corner, perhaps in another year or two. As my friend's 9 year old said while pointing to a picture of one of his step-dad's friends, "he's gay right?  Not gay as in funny, ha, ha, but gay as in queer."  How is it our children get older and older while still being so young?

						   Yesterday I had the joy of driving in 60 mph winds, watching the tops of trees bending to the ground and hail striking my car, splattering on the windshield.  It was kewl. As opposed to quol, which is a geil sorta kewl. And geil being  the German equivalent of super kewl. "Es ist geil Mann!"  So sayeth my friend Markus, normally over a new death metal band which either kills or deadens a few of his brain cells.   After the storm passed, the power went out. WTF?  AFTER the storm?? So, I'm writing this at that legal job, waiting for my boss to wander by so I can switch screens. I hate fucking off at my job but some days it just seems the only way to get through the day. I'm all messed up anyway from the holiday, not to mention I woke up at least twice checking the time last night. Okay, I didn't check the time.  I evaluated the amount of daylight in my house as opposed to moonlight and when I heard the garbage truck go by, I knew it was about 6:45. Thank you garbage men.   My son had ridden his bike to school so we wandered down to pick it up. Its only 3 blocks down and 4 or 5 blocks over. For some reason, it made me feel very feminine to walk with my son's hand in mine, at least until he saw some of his friends, (mental sob), with the wind whipping my dress and mainly because I was commando and I love the feel of a good wind tossing soft material against my body, its very cleansing, better naked, but it was not likely I would out strolling nude.   Except...one weekend when the kids were either alseep or away, my neighbor (that's J.A.) and one of her friends and I got extremely drunk and trotted the 10-15 feet between our front doors topless. The men were in the house and had pretty much left us to our own devices. The next morning I got up to let one of my cats in and I stepped out on the porch and saw a train parked in front of my house (I live by the tracks) and for the life of me could not remember if he had been there last night.   J.A.'s husband told me later that the neighbor on the other side of them and his buddy had been sitting in a car on the street smoking a joint when we three ladies came sauntering out. He said they almost choked to death on their smoke. I laughed long and hard at that. I always thought it was too bad that we didn't know they were there. I'm naturally salacious and ornery in my intimacies but I was single and drunk at the time with two other drunk ornery women, the possibilities were endless. How I wish I had known they were there!

						   I've worked very hard this week on peeling the onion. It has been difficult. Having AZ back has helped this because now I can write to him again. (Its another story as to why I haven't been, but anyway.) The birth of my niece also facilitated this journey.  The best way to explain what I have been feeling is best outlined by excerpts from first the 35 page handwritten letter and the 7 and 4 pages typewritten letters to AZ. The first he received on Tuesday, the next on Wednesday and I just dropped the last one in the mail not five minutes ago. Yeah, well, I started the 35 pager on Monday the 19th. Did I also mention the three e-mails?  7/27 I’ve spent my whole life saying, "I’ll do better, I’ll do better, I’ll do better." When my mom would put me down or bring my brother into conversations, like what I did wasn’t ever good enough, I got that mind set, I will do better, I will do better, I will make them proud, I will be the good child, I will love harder, I will try harder, I will make better grades (gee, where do you go from A’s? Oh, A+’s) It wasn’t ambition. It was trying to please them, my mom and dad.  And I still have it. I’ll do better. I’ll make more money. I’ll be the good child. I’ll love harder. I will be the good child. I will be the good child. I will be the good child. I’m so fucking sick of being the good child. I don’t want to hurt my parents, especially my dad. But I’m so fucking sick of being the goddamn good child. I’m so fucking sick of listening to her and how she makes excuses for my brother. I hated the way they ganged up on me when I was a kid. He knew he could get by with more, so he did.  My brother and I haven’t had a conversation in like 4 years. Most of the time he acts like I’m not even there. And why do I put up with it? Because I’M THE GOOD CHILD!! Work with me here. Its always been MY JOB to mend fences and soothe the scratches and all that shit. That’s MY JOB in the family. I put up with all the shit. That’s always been MY JOB. Well, not anymore.  7/29 butt-fucking early in the a.m.  Anyway, I'm feeling much less evil than I was before. Mainly because I did pinpoint the axis of evil, the source of frustration and irritation which is the not necessarily this whole baby shit but the way my parents kiss my brother and sister-in-law's asses. Then it dawned on me, doh! that my brother and sil treat my parents like shit and make them wonder what they ever did so bad as to be so low of their totem pole of life. I forgot that karmic law thing. So, as the world turns, we're even.  7/29 late evening  Okay, let me get this baby stuff off my mind and finish up what I figured out. I did a lot of deep thinking and realized that although my family may have treated me like shit, they’re the ones who missed out. I used to think I missed so much being single and with my family so estranged from me. But it really wasn’t me. I mean, I was there the whole time, every doctor visit, every ultrasound, every roll, bump, hiccup and kick. I was at my baby shower. No one from my family was. So who missed out? I have only two pictures of myself pregnant and one you can’t tell it because it was taken at Christmas. The other one is at a side angle with me sitting but I have no idea where it is. And that’s it... I’ve spent all this time being bogged down by what I felt I missed and now I’ve realized, it wasn’t me, it was them. They’re the ones who missed out and they have no one to blame for that but themselves.  July 30, 2004  That has opened a gateway for me to look at other situations in my life differently. Instead of constantly questioning why things have been the way they are, I’m looking at the situation and saying, "look at what they’re missing by treating me this way." And look what I’m missing by not being able to fully be myself...  So... that's what I have worked on this week.  I wrote the above at work this afternoon and on the way I home I realized that my brother married a woman exactly like my mother.  I remembered the death of my Grandma and how at the age of 16, when she died, I really had no idea who she was.  It started with my Grandpa looking at me and saying, "You are a lot like your grandmother."  This made me proud in one way and sad in another.  My mother favored her family over my dad's and made it a point, because she did not like my grandmother, to hold us away from them.   She talked about my grandparents poorly, especially my Grandma because she was messy and she swore and smoked and wasn't a warm and fuzzy person.  My Grandma yelled a lot but she was still my Grandma.  Frankly, my mom was a lot like her in personality.  So, my dad married his mom and my brother married his mom.  I'm lucky that I do have some good memories of her and that I was finally wising up to my mom and made it a point to have contact with my dad's parents.  Unfortunately, right after I figured this out, my Grandma died of emphysema.  As far as karmic law goes, paybacks are a bitch.  My dad didn't stand up to my mom and insist that we spend as much time with his parents as we did hers.  My memories of them are fleeting but still significant.  That is another post entirely.  Perhaps no one else sees the emergence of this pattern.  I do.  I can't change it.   My mom and dad want me to play nice and be "the good child."  I haven't done anything wrong.  I have always been the one to try and made amends and put aside my thoughts and feelings to "keep peace" so we can pretend we have some sort of "normal" family.  This is an illusion I refuse to feed anymore.  I've tried in the past to faciliate relationships between myself and my brother and his family.  I've been scorned and ignored.  Just because my parents don't have the guts to stand up to my brother and tell him that his actions and those of his wife hurt them is not my fault.   I miss not being able to participate fully in the lives of my brother and his progeny but it is not my doing.  I have been ready and available.  My brother and his wife choose to exclude people from their children's lives who are good, solid folks who will love and support their children.  The saddest part is the wave of disgust I feel from my sister-in-law as her boys run to me and Hyper-Boy, yelling our names when they see us, happy and smiling.   They know Aunt Inanna will pull them around the yard in the wagon, take them fishing and for walks in the woods.  Aunt Inanna will kick the ball, show them the deer that hide in the shadows and point out the mushrooms and different kinds of trees and plants.  J1, my oldest nephew, is the one I had spent the most effort seeing when he was a baby.  I went to visit to spite my brother and his wife.  With the birth of J2, 17 months later, that became more difficult.  J2 hated me for the longest time.  He wanted absolutely nothing to do with me.  One day it was as though a switch was thrown and he realized who I was.  Now, he's my buddy.  I know things with Annie will probably be the same.  I have faith that Annie, like her brothers, will eventually realize what her mother cannot.  That we're a good sort and we love them and want to spend time with them and learn who they are.  The effort I make will be made toward a relationship with my niece and nephews.  I am done with making an effort towards their parents because it has not been reciprocated, ever.  I'm not the one missing out.

						   I will not be going to see my new niece Annie anytime soon.&nbsp; She will probably be 3 or 4 months old before I lay eyes on her.&nbsp; There are many reasons for this and coming to the decision not to go to my brother's house has been a hard one.   My brother and I are not close.&nbsp; We were as children but then I grew boobs and he figured out he was mom's favorite and used it against me.&nbsp; The last conversation we had entailed him recounting a conversation he had with our father in which he told my dad that as soon as he died he was going to sell the farm.&nbsp; I told him I thought that was a cruel thing to say as my parents have worked their whole lives for what they have and it is their dream.&nbsp; My dad was none to pleased either.&nbsp; It made him angry but more so, it hurt his feelings.&nbsp; I reminded my brother that he was not the single heir to the kingdom and any, and I do mean,  any  decisions that were made following our parents death would include me.&nbsp; I also told him I thought he was rotten and insenstive.&nbsp; I think that was 4 years ago, although I'm not sure.   My sister-in-law is just a bitch.&nbsp; Her family are assholes.&nbsp; They look down upon us as though we are simple folk without brains and that we're not good enough to walk upon their lily-white land.&nbsp; Fuck 'em.   The decision to not travel north two hours to see this new flesh-of-my-flesh has been very, very difficult.&nbsp; I love my nephews, even if they have been taught absolutely nothing their entire lives and wreak havoc everywhere they go, and, I love my niece.&nbsp; It is not their fault they have been allowed to run amok and terrorize everyone and everything in their path, including each other.&nbsp; They are both very cute, very smart little boys and I have no doubts that Annie will follow in their footsteps in all ways.&nbsp;   Here is why I will not being going.&nbsp; I do not feel welcome and I do feel as though my son is welcome.&nbsp; I am not invited to be a part of their lives unless it suits them for something they want.&nbsp; Additionally, they treat my parents like shit.&nbsp; I don't have much respect for my brother and the way he allows his wife to dictate to him that her family is more important that his.&nbsp;   The final straw for me was Hyper-Boy's birthday.&nbsp; I do not have a party for him, his dad does that.&nbsp; We have our own thing that we do.&nbsp; However, since it is close to the 4th of July, I normally take him to my parents and invite my brother and family down.&nbsp; That didn't happen this year for many reasons.&nbsp; My brother and family sent him a card.&nbsp; I could see the disappointment in his eyes as there was nothing inside.&nbsp;   I try to teach my son to accept what is given and not ask for more.&nbsp; However, I cannot help that he sees a discrepancy in what we do for my nephews and what he received.&nbsp; I always try to get my nephews a little something for their birthdays and make the two hour trek north for their parties.&nbsp; Hyper-Boy would have been thrilled with a new state quarter taped to the inside, or one of the gold dollar coins.&nbsp; He thinks things like that are kewl and neat.&nbsp; That's all.&nbsp;   Now, I know some of you are thinking that it is wrong for me to expect my brother to send my son a gift of any kind.&nbsp; Its the thought that counts, right?&nbsp; Well, I know that my brother and his wife buy gifts for all of her nieces and nephews...&nbsp;and she has five.&nbsp; I see a difference being made here and I don't like it.&nbsp; Especially when&nbsp;my son sees it and realizes it.&nbsp;&nbsp;  My mom, in all&nbsp;of her wisdom, said that it was a good lesson in humility for Hyper-Boy.&nbsp; I'm not sorry to say that I jumped her shit.&nbsp; I shot back that my son will learn plenty of lessons in life and already has and that he didn't need his own family shoving it down his throat.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether you agree or disagree, I stand by what I said.&nbsp;   Further, my brother makes zero effort to get to know&nbsp;my son, his nephew.&nbsp; What he likes, what kind of personality he has, nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not allowed to hold Nephew #1 for the first 3 or 4 months of his life.&nbsp; Nephew #2, I just walked in and&nbsp;picked him up but not for long.&nbsp; I really don't feel like&nbsp;dealing with all that bullshit again and since AZ set me straight about how I was subjecting Hyper-Boy to this,&nbsp;he's not going either, with or without me.&nbsp; Period. &nbsp;  The conversation with my mother today went something like this:  Well you and Hyper-Boy can go up with me and your dad to see the baby  No, we're not.  Well, if you go up with us then they probably won't treat you like they did before.  We're not going.   Well, maybe you should just give it a little time for them to recuperate and then you can go up.  I'm not going mother.   Well, now&nbsp;Inanna.&nbsp;   (Silence)  Did you just stop by the last time you were there?&nbsp; Or did you call first?  Mother, I don't make a 2 hour trip to just "stop by", of course I called them first.&nbsp; (Now this is my fault?)&nbsp;    Inanna    &nbsp;  Mo-ther    &nbsp; Needless to say, my mother believes I'm going to change my mind and be "the good child."&nbsp; I'll talk more about the "good child" syndrome tomorrow and also some other things I figured out in relation to myself and my family.&nbsp; Thanks to T-Bird, I made a major stride in letting go of some pretty rotten baggage.&nbsp;

						   (Telephone ringing) (whispery throaty voice)&nbsp; Hello Inanna. Yeah. (Who the fuck else would answer my phone at 4 a.m. with a female voice?) We still don't have a baby. (Then why the fuck are you calling me? At 4 fucking A.M.?) They checked her at 12:45 and she had only dilated to 2.  Uh huh. I told you it would today before she had that baby.&nbsp; Do you know you have to be at the homestead for closing at 9 a.m. (Why did I bring this up?) Yes! and I'm really upset about that. I'm calling the realtor at 6 a.m. and... (blah, blah, blah... snore) Inanna?&nbsp;  Yep. Well, I'm going to go (blah, blah) Yeah, call me when we have a baby.   7:30 a.m. (whilst I sleep through the alarm for 45 minutes) (Telephone ringing) (whispery throaty voice) Hello We still don't have a baby...blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...6 cm....blah, blah, blah...epidural...passing out... blah, blah, blah... 11:00 a.m....blah, blah.. realtor... blah, blah...

						     You are the Devil card. The Devil is based on the figure Pan, Lord of the Dance. The earthy physicality of the devil breeds lust. The devil's call to return to primal instincts often creates conflict in a society in which many of these instincts must be kept under control. Challenges posed by our physical bodies can be overcome by strength in the mental, emotional, and spiritual realms. Pan is also a symbol of enjoyment and rules our material creativity. The devil knows physical pleasure and how to manipulate the physical world. Material creativity finds its output in such things as dance, pottery, gardening, and sex. The self-actualized person is able to accept the sensuality and usefulness of the devil's gifts while remaining in control of any darker urges.

						    Too Many Memories  Take me back  Too many memories  Take me back  So many memories  Take me back    (I can't remember all of the lyrics... this is the best I can do)    Everywhere I go    and every place  I imagine I still see her face  Oh there ain't a way I can erase   Too many memories  That make me cry  Too many memories  That never die  No they won't ever die   I will go on dying everday  Oh baby if you don't come home to stay  Oh there ain't a way I can erase    Anyway, I can't remember any more, at least in any coherent form. That song is by Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons and was released along with  Walk Like A Man, Sherry, and Big Girls Don't Cry  sometime in the 70's. I know this because it was on 8-track and it was owned by my mother. It was a compilation of sorts but I don't remember the name of it. My mother may still have the 8-track and she probably has something to play it on.   Anyway, as early as 1977 I can remember listening to and singing that song. I remember because our Chihuahua, Taffy, died on January 22, 1977. I remember that because it is my aunt's birthday. I remember crying to that song because it was sad. It spoke of loss and pain. Years later, while the 8-Track player still functioned, I sat down and transcribed the lyrics and put them in my writing folder. I know they are written on lined notebook paper and there is a sticker on the paper of a green dragon. It is written in neat 12-year old handwriting, as though it was very important. It was important and it still is because I gave it significance.   As so I can say, there is the instant where my love affair with music began. It is where I began attaching significance to memories and reliving those memories encased in music.    Just a small town girl  Livin' in a lonely world  She took the midnight train  Goin' anywhere   Just a city boy  Born and raised in South Detroit  He took the midnight train  Goin' anywhere   A singer in a smoky room  The smell of wine and cheap perfume  For a smile they can share the night  It goes on and on and on and on    That's  Don't Stop Believin'  by Journey. Those lyrics always bring my bud AZ to mind as he was raised in Detroit and I was raised in a small town and, well, it means something to me. To me, that song is us. It is the essence of us and will forever be the essence of us, if only in my mind, in my memories. Its soft like a pillow and I lay down on it frequently.   A lot of people attach significance to songs because they were playing at a certain time in our lives, when something significant happened. I can remember a couple of instances of that happening.    Everybody Wants You -- Billy Squire   You see 'em comin' at you every night  Strung on pretension,  they fall for you at first sight  You know their business,  you think it's a bore  They make you restless,  it's nothin' you ain't seen before  Get around town, spend your time on the run  You never let down,  say you do it for fun  Never miss a play,  though you make quite a few  You give it all away -  everybody wants you   Thunderstruck - AC/DC   (Thunder)  I was caught  In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder) [...of a lightning attack]  I looked round  And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)  My mind raced  And I thought what could I do (Thunder)  And I knew  There was no help, no help from you (Thunder)  Sound of the drums  Beatin' in my heart  The thunder of guns  Tore me apart  You've been - thunderstruck    I used to dance to those two songs at the bar that AZ worked. He worked on the second floor which overlooked the dance floor if you stood at the far end of it and occasionally I would catch him watching me. Yes, I was an attention whore, not to mention, I really love to dance. I'm not much for today's dance music though unless you count "Dirrty" by Christina Aquilera and the Moulin Rouge song  Lady Marmalade .   Right now I'm listening to Skid Row's  Slave to&nbsp;the   Grind  which includes such memorable tunes as  Psycho Love, Get the Fuck Out, Quicksand Jesus  and  Wasted Time . I remember being in the mosh pit at the Skid Row/Pantera show sometime during the Slave tour and before Sebastian Bach made his exit. I remember watching Rachel Bolan's hair swinging along with his nose ring to earring via chain ensemble to  Piece of Me.   Caught a lonely lady  Crying on a cigarette  I got nasty, nasty habits  And that's all she's gonna get from me   One for the money, two for the show  A 'round and 'round and 'round we go  Take a look at what-a you might need  You better hurry  To get a piece of me   I don't have looks,  I don't have money  But I know one thing's for sure  One night ain't enough of my love  She wanted more, more, more    When I came home the other night I immediately started looking for  Skid Row  and found  Slave to the Grind,  which is cool but I also found Cinderella's  Night Songs , which includes  Push, Push, Somebody Save Me  and  Shake Me.     She’s lookin’ fine  Flashin’ like a neon sign  She thinks it’s love  I said that comes with time  I’m gettin’ ready  The love’s lookin’ steady  It’s gettin’ sticky  I thought she might miss me  She looked at me and said  I need a little   Push, push  Come and give a little  Push, push  If ya take a little  Push, push  Then you’ll get a little  Push, push    AZ and I were discussing the greatness of the late 80's, early 90's... the time before responsibility, a time of fun and parties, headbanging, air guitar. He spoke wistfully, however... I still know that Push, Push is great song to strip to. I think he needs reminding that although he now has three jobs, a house and all the trappings of being a "real" adult, as long as the music lives, the memories live and as long as the memories live we're still 21 and 28, I'm still drunk, sleeping in my car waiting for him to come home. He still owns a blue and green bathrobe and has long hair. I think its time to remind him.

						   I'll try not to take anyone's blog ideas with this post.&nbsp; (wink)   I finally crawled out of bed at 4:00 p.m.&nbsp; I had drank the night before with new medication and I was feeling very sluggy.&nbsp; I vowed to answer everytime the phone rang. One, because the Caller ID is in the kitchen and I didn't want to get out of bed.&nbsp; Two, I wanted to stop telemarketers from bothering me.&nbsp; So, I fielded two calls from people looking for a towing company.&nbsp; On the second call I ascertained they were calling from a state north of me.&nbsp; They had used the wrong area code and got me.&nbsp; Sorry, no towing here.   I also pissed off the Troopers Association and some person trying to get me to take out a new Mastercard.&nbsp; My mother called and talked  at  me for 45 minutes and I talked to my friend KC.&nbsp; In between all of the phone calls I lounged with three or four of my eight cats.&nbsp; The mistress sleeps, we all sleep.   I trudged out of bed and checked the e-mail, chatted for a bit and decided, wow, I'm hungry.&nbsp; So, off I went to get breakfast at 6:00.&nbsp; I got to T-Bird's at 6:35 and caught the end of "When KISS Ruled the World," funny, I thought they still did.&nbsp; Did you know the tongue is the strongest muscle in the body?&nbsp; And Gene Simmons is one strong man!!&nbsp;   VH1 was running their "100 Best Moments of Metal" but they started at 80... dunno why, but I sat and watched the whole thing.&nbsp; I love the 80's hair band, headbangers, metal gods... That's my kind of music.&nbsp; So, then I got woke up finally at 11:00.&nbsp; Then, what to do?&nbsp; T-Bird and one of her friends had left me at her apartment watching TV and her ex-husband was puttering around but I knew I had that Winger CD in my car.&nbsp; Off I go.   First, I picked up two packs of cigs and secondly, went looking for my friend AZ.&nbsp; I drove by one place of employment, not there that I could tell.&nbsp; Went by his house, not home.&nbsp; Swung back by the place of employment... ahhh, there he is, hiding in the back.&nbsp; I buzzed up his cell phone.&nbsp; He was happy to hear from me and invited me in.&nbsp; (This is where we got caught by the fax machine, hee hee)&nbsp;   Now, I've mentioned AZ a few times.&nbsp; He and I have been friends for 12 years.&nbsp; Trust me, he is darkness, I am light.&nbsp; However I am yin, he is yang.&nbsp; Although the dark part of the yin-yang symbol is dark, due to the moon and yin is the light part due to the sun... Sun God = Ra, Moon = the Goddess, at least in my religion but otherwise... eh, male and female energies.&nbsp; AZ is 6'0", maybe 6'1" and I'm 5'3". He's dark-headed and dark-eyed and I'm blond and blue-eyed.&nbsp; I think Gene Simmons wrote the song "Charisma" about him.&nbsp; (By the way, that song is on Gene Simmons' solo album, which was released about 1978)&nbsp; And... hmmmmm... AZ reminds me Gene Simmons, just less make-up and the tongue thing.&nbsp; Its something about the wickedness in the eyes.   Anyway, I'll do a dissertation on my history with AZ another time.&nbsp; I will say, he is my best friend.&nbsp; When I was seeing Lex it was difficult for me to write or talk to him in some ways because he and Lex were friends or at least they work together and actually get along.&nbsp; Now I know why AZ never fixed me up with any of his friends. It sucked.&nbsp; I didn't feel like it was cool to diss one of his friends to him and I think he was a little jealous.&nbsp; Now, I'm getting into this whole thing.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; Okay, AZ and I have never dated.&nbsp; Not that I think we didn't want to at times, it just was never the right time.&nbsp; When the shit gets deep though, we call each other, not our significant other at the time.&nbsp; Its telling me something but not sure if he's hearing it yet.   I digress.  So, I walk in and we go to the front office where he's on the computer.&nbsp; I immediately just sacked out in the floor and he asked about my day.&nbsp; I asked about his.&nbsp;   Then he got up and I knew he was tired because he works all. the. time.&nbsp; But, he had me in front of him and was giving me directions.&nbsp; It felt like "Spinal Tap" being in the bowels of this business&nbsp; and having no idea where I was going, which ended up being a conference room.&nbsp; We each grabbed a seat.   If there is silence between us its companionable but tonight, since we hadn't had much of chance to talk lately, we caught up on everything.&nbsp; He told me about taking his 91 year old grandmother to the casinos. How cool is that???&nbsp; He said she had a cigarette in one hand, feeding the machine quarters with the other.&nbsp; She won too.&nbsp; Go Nana!&nbsp; For the most part though, he worked on her house.&nbsp; He's good that way.&nbsp; I rubbed his back and his feet because I'm good that way.&nbsp;   Its amazing how many people are out and about at 1:00 in the morning.&nbsp; Finally, a lady came in and began to talk our ears off and we inched, I mean  inched  our way to the door.&nbsp; We gave the one-armed hug and I took off.&nbsp; He buzzed my cell 3 minutes later.&nbsp; We would have never gotten out of there if he hadn't done that.&nbsp; Hahaha.&nbsp; So, he's home with his dog and I'm home with my cats (told you we were yin and yang).&nbsp;   Luckily, I just put minutes on my phone because we used up 36 of them.&nbsp; Then we talked 10 or so more minutes on my home phone.&nbsp; He told me how glad he was to talk to me and I him.&nbsp; I've missed him.&nbsp; I told him I would see him Wednesday, hopefully.&nbsp; Maybe next weekend we will get together and watch a movie and I'll massage his hands. That man loves a hand massage just about more than other things.&nbsp;(heh, I said almost)  Anyway, now I'm wide fucking awake.&nbsp; I get back up, get my CDs and get in the car and proceed to drive and drive and drive, listening to Winger and other 80's shit.&nbsp;&nbsp;I almost hit two deer in the fog.&nbsp; Got that damn shitter off my ass for sure when I slammed the brakes on.&nbsp; He rode a little further back after that.&nbsp; Fucker.&nbsp; Then some ass monkey wants to race me in the fog on the Interstate at 3:00 a.m.&nbsp; Motherfucker, I'm sober as a judge and I don't give a shit if the cops pull my ass over!!&nbsp; He ate my dust in the fog.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I get off the Interstate and back on the secondary and see a whole shit load of blue lights.&nbsp; I'm thinking its a DUI checkpoint, which is cool since I'm not drunk.&nbsp; There is that little issue of my inspection sticker being expired... oops.&nbsp; But no, thank goodness, it looked like a raid on a bar or something.&nbsp; There were eight cop cars there, blocking most of the patrons in.&nbsp; Oh well, there shittin' luck.&nbsp; I came home, popped in some Cinderella&nbsp;and XYZ and I'm still awake at 5:13 a.m.&nbsp; Will attempt sleep here shortly.&nbsp; Wow, its been a great night.

						   That's how many days I have been alive.&nbsp;(and yes you anal retentives, I counted leap years...hence the 1/4th)&nbsp; 11,201 days is approximately how long I have been old enough to have memories.&nbsp; That would make me three years old and that's the first memory I had... busting my eyebrow open on the window sash and having to have it sewn up.&nbsp; So, give or take a thousand or so days, that's a lot of days. That's a lot of memories.&nbsp;  Not all of those memories are good ones.&nbsp; For some reason, I have an unusually evolved, technicolor memory.&nbsp; I can remember conversations practically down to the punctuation.&nbsp; OY!&nbsp; However, I needlessly torment myself by remembering shit better left forgotten.&nbsp; Keep the lesson, drop the memory, drop the baggage.  A way I have figured out to do this while "peeling the onion" is to know, not pretending anymore, to  know  I only have so many slots for memories.&nbsp; I no longer have infinite memory slots, now they are finite.&nbsp; With this finite number of slots I now have to decide how to fill them.&nbsp; What moron would fill them with bad memories?&nbsp; Not I!!  For example:&nbsp; My friend AZ and I have had some pretty wonderful times together, things we both remember.&nbsp; They have significance if for nothing more than to think of something good rather than bad.&nbsp; A time when life wasn't perfect but together, it made us forget that for a while.&nbsp;   Hee hee, one night AZ and I were messing around, not sure how we even got to his place of employment, I'm sure he would remember that part but we weren't alone so we went outside.&nbsp; It was dark, thankfully, and we walked around the corner of the building where this big tree was.&nbsp; Before long I was pressed up against the building with his mouth on my bare breasts (still have NO idea how that happened so fast) and suddenly a helicopter with a searchlight flew over.&nbsp; SHIT!!&nbsp; Figured we were busted but actually a train had hit a car at the crossing.&nbsp; Whew!&nbsp; Anyway, years later AZ called me and told me they had cut "our" tree down.&nbsp; Whaaaaa!!!&nbsp; No matter, the building is still there and I still feel the brick against my back.&nbsp;   Another time, we were in the middle of doing things we shouldn't be, again in his place of employment although not the same place as before and, well, frankly, it was late and deserted but we just shouldn't have been there doing what we were doing for a multitude of reasons, however, there we were.&nbsp; We heard a click and more noise... shit!!&nbsp; Gonna get busted and luckily with a few nips, tucks and zips we were decent.&nbsp; AZ goes to head off whoever it is, comes back in, I believe he may have been laughing, but it was just the fax machine.&nbsp; BUSTED BY THE FAX MACHINE!!!   Ha! Well, it happens.&nbsp; I have a lot more stories about AZ and none of them bad.&nbsp; Not that we haven't fussed and shit happened between us but I have no capacity to see any of it as  bad .&nbsp; It happened for a reason that was later revealed and he's the one person I can say knows the most about me, the honest, insecure me, and still likes me anyway.&nbsp; I know a lot about him too.&nbsp; It took him a lot longer to come clean with me about some things but now that I know, I not only still like him, but I like him better.&nbsp;&nbsp; I realize that folks believe when you open up you make yourself vulnerable.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do to the wrong people, you are vulnerable.&nbsp; To the right people, it only makes you more human in their eyes.&nbsp; It proves you are fallible and imperfect, just like they are.   I digress.&nbsp; The memory slots... getting there.&nbsp; So, there's two memories of me and AZ, this most wonderful, important person in my life and I will fill Memory Slots 1 and 2 with these memories.&nbsp; Now, this is the hard part.&nbsp; I have to give up 3 bad memories for each slot.&nbsp; I now am responsible for giving up 6 bad memories.&nbsp; For Memory Slot 1, I give up anyone who has ever made fun of me for being messy and making me feel bad about myself because I am.&nbsp; I give up the guilt I felt because I called my host mother a bitch when I lived in Germany and she found out about it.&nbsp; She read my diary, I deserved privacy.&nbsp; I give up the hatred I have felt towards my mother for writing that horrible letter right after I went to Germany.&nbsp;   Now, I have to write that down somewhere else.&nbsp; If I ever think of those bad memories again, I have to think of AZ pressing me up against that building.&nbsp; Those bad memories no longer exist in my memory slots.&nbsp; Good bye!!  And so, it will go on and I will bore you or excite you with further details as they become available.&nbsp; For now, I have to write down my lost memories and fill them with something good.&nbsp; And... I'm writing a letter to AZ and I just had an epiphany.&nbsp;

						   I was going to post about something fun but decided not to. I can post about that great concert in Germany any time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you all for your comments and support.&nbsp; That was a very cathartic thing, being able to rant and rave and let the hurt out.&nbsp; Now, I'm at peace.&nbsp; I know this was the best decision for me and for him.&nbsp; He didn't have a say in the matter but... eh.  Lex finally decided to talk to me today.&nbsp; He did not ackowledge in any way anything I said in my messages to him over the weekend.&nbsp; I'm surprised he got the balls up to talk to me.&nbsp; No, I didn't let him have it again.&nbsp; I had said all I was going to say about how he treated me.&nbsp; I just told him that I knew he was unhappy living here and wondered why he stayed.&nbsp; Money.  Fair enough.&nbsp; It was ackward and he's still closed and, well, rude, but either we'll make it as friends or we won't.&nbsp;   The most important thing about being with Lex is what I learned.&nbsp; I learned, he's not my ONE. He's not the guy that will make me happy.&nbsp; I tried very hard with him.&nbsp; But, I learned, I shouldn't have to.&nbsp; Love, is simple, so sayeth a friend of mine.&nbsp; It really is.&nbsp; Its as simple as sitting and watching a Disney movies until 4 a.m. and enjoying it, without saying a word, only holding hands, comfortable silence within the depths of cats and toys and enough clutter and junk to fill a landfill.&nbsp;   It is as simple as standing in front of a mirror with them behind you.&nbsp; You can see you, you can see them, they can see you and they can see themselves.&nbsp; That is beauty, that is whole, that is complete.&nbsp; Its the merest touch of a hand, its a smile.&nbsp; Its darkness and light, male and female, acceptance and understanding.&nbsp; Simply though, its not them seeing what we see in ourselves, its them seeing who we truly are.&nbsp; The core.&nbsp; Its the puzzle piece that fits our piece, exactly.&nbsp; The strengths meeting the weaknesses, the dawn and the dusk, the moon and the sun.  But simply, its realizing that although we may be weak, we have faults, we've been beaten and scorned, hurt and betrayed... we see all that is wrong with ourselves but they see everything that is right.&nbsp; And we see everything that is right with them. We match.&nbsp; We're complete and whole.&nbsp; It is really that simple.&nbsp; (Thanks J. and C. for helping me see that.)

						   RUSH   Show Don't Tell    How many times do you hear it?   It goes on all day long   Everyone knows everything   And no one's ever wrong   Until later...   Who can you believe?   It's hard to play it safe   But apart from a few good friends   We don't take anything on faith   Until later...   Show...don't tell...(Show me, don't tell me)   You've figured out the score(Show me, don't tell me)   I've heard it all before(Show me, don't tell me)   I don't care what you say(Show me, don't tell me)    &nbsp; So, I didn't post all of the lyrics... you get the point. I'd like to say that I want to be nice and sweet and kind as I believe I should be. However, I do not feel any of those things. I'm fucking pissed.&nbsp;Tomorrow I will sweet and good and kind and tell you all the things I like about Lex -- you don't know Lex?&nbsp; Oh, he's the Beaufriend, or rather he  was  the Beaufriend.&nbsp; Now, he's just Lex.&nbsp; That's not his real name but I picked it for a specific purpose that I will not reveal here. &nbsp; And while I'm being honest and&nbsp;pissy... Lex never was my boyfriend.&nbsp; Yes, we hung out, we had sex, I love him dearly but he was&nbsp;never my boyfriend. My&nbsp;definition of boyfriend is someone that you spend time with, share your life with in hopes or to see if you may be compatable enough to spend your lives together.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lex and I started talking and seeing each other, that was all good, we hung together, watched movies, shared ourselves.&nbsp; Now, that's not the way it is.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Over the past&nbsp;month, Lex has become increasingly distant and withdrawn.&nbsp; We have spent less time&nbsp;together and&nbsp;conversations have consisted of me making conversation and him interjecting one word responses.&nbsp; My attempts for us to spend time together (i.e. movies, walks, dinner, concerts&nbsp;etc.) have been rebuffed or simply not responded to.&nbsp; He has disappeared for days at a time. &nbsp;He did not thank me for his birthday gift.&nbsp; He didn't even acknowledge it in any way.&nbsp; He went to the fireworks without me.&nbsp; He went to see Fahrenheit 9/11 without me, knowing how much I wanted to see it.&nbsp; Sorry, but I don't give a shit if you want to call me a whiner or a bitch or I need help but fucking goddamn, that fucking hurts.&nbsp; And can I tell ya what kind of confusion set in??? &nbsp; Now, he can tell my friends that he thinks I'm "awesome" but he's "scared" but he can't talk to me about his fears.&nbsp;Hello!!&nbsp; I'm the one he needs to talk to about this. Oh, I'm sorry, that would make him vulnerable!!!&nbsp; Now, get this... I've been very honest with him about what has been going on in my life and inside of ME... so he understands if I'm a little gooky or wierd, not that I'm not normally anyway, but if things go a little overboard.&nbsp; He's one of the reasons I decided to peel the fucking onion!!!&nbsp; Me, my son and him.&nbsp; The three BIG REASONS why I'm tired of being sick and tired and why I want to be a better me.  &nbsp; Lex has not had a perfect life... he's been slammed and hurt the same way I have.&nbsp; He's had his ass handed to him in relationships, he's lost his father, his brother is a fucking jerk and frankly he's probably felt as alone, lonely and freaky as I have most of the my life.&nbsp; He's sensitive and incredibly intuitive.&nbsp; He also hides.&nbsp; I'm fucking sick of it. Yeah, I'm a strong bitch.&nbsp; That is a good thing and its a bad thing because you know what?&nbsp; Life hasn't been great to me either in a lot of ways or I wouldn't be peeling the fucking onion!!!&nbsp; And it really FUCKING PISSES ME OFF WHEN OTHER PEOPLE DON'T FUCKING PEEL THEIR ONIONS!!!&nbsp;  &nbsp; This onion peeling thing is not new to me. I've been peeling the onion for 8 years.&nbsp; Sometimes what I peel off reappears which means I haven't truly dealt with that issue.&nbsp; I peel it again and again and again. I do not give up.&nbsp; I'm not perfect, I never will be, but I don't quit.&nbsp; I will not hide.&nbsp; I will not allow fear of love and fear of loss to rule my life!!&nbsp; Maybe its wrong to expect the people in my life to do the same.&nbsp; Fuck that shit!!&nbsp; My friend T-Bird has told me more than once, you know SO IT SINKS IN... if ya gonna bitch but not gonna do anything to change it then SHUT THE HELL UP!!&nbsp;  &nbsp; In other words, if you don't have the balls to face it and do something about it then quit whining and bitching about it and certainly quit using it as an excuse to hide your sorry ass or your sorry head in the sand.&nbsp; I know what I've been through.&nbsp; And shit it hurt!!!&nbsp; I know what he's been through and shit, it had to hurt!!!  &nbsp; So here it is Lex. You hurt me.&nbsp; You hurt me by rebuffing all of my attempts to bring us closer together, by ignoring my e-mails, my messages and my own pain.&nbsp; I hate not being&nbsp;validated. That hurts worse than anything.&nbsp; I felt hidden away as a dirty secret.&nbsp; That hurt.&nbsp; I am no one's dirty secret. I am no one's secret period.&nbsp; I am beautiful and intelligent, loyal, faithful, loving and giving.&nbsp; I'm strong but I'm also soft.&nbsp;  &nbsp; For whatever reason you decided to stick your head so far up your ass you won't see daylight for a couple of months or years, that's you're own fault and your own weakness that you refuse to face and deal with.&nbsp; It is no longer a problem.&nbsp; I REFUSE to allow you to treat me as though I'm nothing.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because it fucking hurts ME!! It goes against everything I am trying to overcome and work through in my life. I explained that to you.&nbsp; You know, I could say that's what I get for being honest but I'm not going to change how I run my life because of your issues.&nbsp; I've compromised enough for long enough.&nbsp; All I asked was that you meet me halfway and I'm the only one at the halfway mark.&nbsp;  &nbsp; You're self-centered to believe that your pain outweighs the rest of the pain in the world.&nbsp; You're self-centered to use the past instances of pain in your life to rebuff a complete and total goddess, that would be me.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, you're just a fucking idiot!!&nbsp; No, I will not censor that because right now I can honestly say, you are the biggest idiot for letting me walk away and doing absolutely nothing to stop it.&nbsp; You can crawl away in your fucking hole and feel sorry for yourself and whine about how I HURT you by leaving.&nbsp; Honey, I love myself more than that. I love myself more than to stay with someone who can't express what they feel and who has turned their back on me for the very last time.&nbsp;  &nbsp; No one turns their back on me anymore.&nbsp; To do so is sudden death.&nbsp; I don't deserve it. I've attempted numerous times to open conversations between us which have been continually rebuffed.&nbsp; I have to face that you do not want to have an open and loving relationship.&nbsp; I have to face that you have continually hidden your "other" life from me and have excluded me.&nbsp; I'm tired of being hurt by it and crying about it.&nbsp; I choose not to be hurt anymore.&nbsp; I was going to say, more importantly, but not more importantly, but importantly, I'm tired of watching you hurt yourself.&nbsp; I'm tired of watching you scuttle away from love and intimacy and hide away in your cave to lick the wounds of your past instead of pulling the festering shit out.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Is that expecting too much?? No, its&nbsp;not because I would never ask you to do what I myself would not do.&nbsp; I hate being so angry because I'm so hurt.&nbsp; I hate giving up the dreams I had of our future.&nbsp; But they were just that... dreams.&nbsp; There was no reality in it.&nbsp; That hurts too.&nbsp; God, I love you so much but that just hurts too.&nbsp; There is no comfort in that.&nbsp; Its just a reminder of what is not and won't be.&nbsp; You have hurt me.&nbsp; I will not let it continue.&nbsp; I will not allow it to layer and layer upon itself.&nbsp; I will not offer myself up as a sacrifice.&nbsp; I will squeeze you from my pores and wipe your sweat from my brow.&nbsp; I will peel your thin layer and continue to work on the thicker layers that infect me worse.&nbsp; I will not hurt anymore.

						   This is a poem I wrote about the ex-drunk boyfriend after he left.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I wrote a poem on the bathroom wall, something I had never done in high school. It was our own wall. Where only a few friends would see it. It was where he hid from me, the only room in the house with a lock. I made it a point to spoil it for him, like he had spoiled Christmas and my birthday and Valentine’s Day. It was the only retribution I had. It was childish and weak, my inability to speak the words that flow freely from my hands. So I spoiled it for him.   The only other sanctuary he had from me and our pathetic life was his room, the one he had taken from me. He would sit and stare at the antlers on the wall, his accomplishments. After a while, neither of us lived in this world. He receded to the woods of his mind, deep and cold with pines that pricked your steps with sharp, stabbing needles and prevented the maples and oaks and dogwoods from growing or blooming. I tried not to live there with him and I always wore shoes in that room, lest I spend hours picking needles out of my feet.   I lived in a perpetual state of suspended hope, ignoring confusion and anger and the spitefulness that rose in me daily. I tried to walk a foot off the ground, but that place is only for ghosts. I assimilated and compromised. Missing, that the part of me that does not like to do such things was angry at me. And as one side of me grew angrier with the other, they fought each other more than I fought with him. The harder I tried the more he slipped through my fingers, like water finding cracks in the stones on the mountain, expanding them with each icy step, until they crumble and can no longer hold the burden on their own.   My empire fell. He left gaping wounds where the fish tank stood and the chair used to be. The walls were pock-marked from his disease and escapism. I patched the walls and filled the empty spaces, but he lingers. He took things from me that did not belong to him, but little by little, I see their return. I feel a little of the old me, the one with hope and joy, but she will never fully return. Of that, I am certain. I do not mourn her passing as I used to. I only accept that I have been changed and to attempt to change back would only irritate that side of myself that does not like to assimilate or compromise.   I have become harsh. Some people call it a wall, others, a sanctuary, where the pines grow tall and the forest lies deep and cold. I can walk without shoes here because the needles do not stab  me, only those who attempt to enter. And to those I say, beware. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I wrote that about him, about me, about us.&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; I'm no longer the person I was when I wrote that.&nbsp; Here is another poem I wrote back when I saw the first Lord of the Rings and found that Viggo Mortensen was also a poet.&nbsp;&nbsp;He inspired me greatly&nbsp;so I named a poem after his character that has nothing to do with his character.&nbsp; One of my absolute fave parts of LOTR1 is when he's sitting in the inn, in the darkness, smoking his pipe and the fire illuminates his eyes...  &nbsp; Strider &nbsp; Stride I do  on thin ice  spider web cracks  I see bubbles beneath my feet  Further away from shore  I go  I should fall through  Ice is thinner in the middle  Or is it?  What if I don’t believe that?  Away from the shore  I go  Stronger I become  The bubbles rumble  But don’t break  Thin ice holds  Even the heaviest of hearts

						   I really used to hate you. I hated you for being a drunk and a thief. I hated you when you stole the mortgage money and went to the strip clubs and pissed on me in the bed. I hated you for taking a room of my house and staying gone all hours of the night and making me worry. I hated you when I would cook a nice dinner and you would come home late and tell me you ate out. I hated you for cheating on me... I know you did. I hated you for turning your back on me in the bed. You knew just how to make me feel unwanted. I hated you because you stole my jewelry, my great-grandmother's ring, which meant so much to me. I hated you everytime the phone rang and it said "POLICE." I just hated you and you became so ugly to me.   But I realize that I learned a lot from being with you. I learned about the kind of person I did not want to be. I did not want to be co-dependent anymore. What started out as love became another tentacle of dependency, of disease, both yours and mine.   I hated facing this house when you moved out, leaving holes in the walls and where the fishtank used to sit. I filled those holes up though. Still within me remains the remnants of the past and what I feel to be stupidity but know in my own right is also just another bad thought that I seek to banish.   I wanted to blame you for everything and then I wanted to blame myself for everything. I realize though we were both the puppet and the puppetmaster. I only hold myself 50% responsible for what happened. It happened. It cannot be changed, but I can. I always asked you to seek help and I will not ask more of you than I would ask of myself.   I've been working steadily in the two years that you left in being a better me. In fighting and casting out the demons that haunt my steps and drag me into the shadows. The shadows of self-doubt, self-loathing and the ever present fear of abandonment, the number one reason to stay in horrible relationships and the reason behind your continued stay in my home.   In some ways, I feel as though I am better than you are and then I find that to be incredibly self-serving. I always hoped that you would get your act together and be the real person that I saw on the inside. Yeah, work on yourself, like I'm working on me. You never wanted to. Maybe your demons are stronger than mine, more painful or your inner strength is not equal to your physical strength.   If the following is true, then I know you have sunk as deep into the shadows as one can fall. I pray that the accusations against you are not in any way true but if they are then I hope you rot in jail.   Excerpt from "The Roanoke Times"  Saturday June 26, 2004 --  "BLACKSBURG - The man accused of brutally attacking a Blacksburg waitress was among the construction workers tearing up the sidewalks through downtown and often said hello and joked with other downtown employees.   That image seemed in sharp contrast with the abduction and attempted rape charges Blacksburg police brought against Ex-Drunk Boyfriend, 26, of Covington this week.   Substitute judge Doug Brinckman arraigned Ex-Drunk Boyfriend on the charges Friday morning in Montgomery County General District Court in Christiansburg... Ex-Drunk Boyfriend, sporting a black eye, kept his head bowed during most of the brief court appearance...  The victim, a 23-year-old waitress and bartender at a downtown restaurant, walked into the alley in the 200 block of North Main Street about 2:30 a.m. Wednesday and was grabbed from behind. The assailant told the woman he was going to sexually assault her as he beat her face and choked her until she passed out in the stairwell leading to the former Ton 80 Club, police said.  She was partially clothed when she regained consciousness but does not remember what occurred, police said. Investigators are waiting for lab results to determine if she was raped..."  I found out the above information when your most current ex-girlfriend tracked me down to inform me and then to ask what had happened between us. $15,000 worth of unpaid debt and the loss of family heirlooms... life's lessons are hard learned. And yeah, I think you did it.  I let you stay much longer than I ever should have. I made myself responsible for things I should not have. You took things from me that you should not have, mentally, emotionally and materially. You lied, you cheated and you stole. The price we have each paid is great... however, I'm sure now you would trade your freedom for the $15,000 indebtedness that you refused to pay back. Some debts are worth paying off, no matter what sacrifice has to be made.   What goes around, comes around. I'm just sorry another human being had to be hurt for it to happen. I'm so glad you are gone from my life. I'm so glad I learned from you. And for whatever force watched over me and my son in your presence, I am forever thankful. Bite me you sorry son of a cocksucker. You reek worse than any onion I've ever peeled. It feels so good to shed your skin.

						   I have a spider in my car. Its about the size, with legs, of a quarter, perhaps a bit smaller. Eustace, as I have named "him", builds a web every night, which I tear down in the morning.   I am a spider fan. Spiders are given leeway in my home. Of course, I don't have Brown Recluses and Black Widows running around either. I just try to pitch them outside where they belong. This is a fairly young spider because I've seen larger versions of the same species on my porch.   Eustace is an orb weaver. He makes the big, symmetrical web. Eustace came to live in my car because he chose the wrong place to sleep. I park my car under the 60 foot Ash tree in my front yard. He built a web between the tree and the side mirror on my car. Sunday when I took HB and TLC to see, what else, Spiderman 2, Eustace was asleep under the side mirror. I saw him but figured the wind would blow him off and he would scurry away. Wrong.   Eustace held on all the way to the theater about 10 miles away. I was driving, at one point, 60 mph. Tough little dude. When we came out of the theater, Eustace is still under the mirror. Sigh. I thought maybe he was dead and had just wrapped himself up in the web as a casket or something. Imagine our surprise when Eustace releases his spinneret and swings into the car. HB hit the backseat. I'm telling the boys to calm down.. its just a spider. Yeah, I thought that until Eustace decided to scurry across my leg, at which point he was rudely brushed away. (shudder)  When I got the car stopped he had disappeared into the bottomless black hole of the passenger side floor. I haven't attempted to find the floor on that side for about 3 or 4 months so... plenty of places for a spider to hide. Since then, I have had a new spiderweb in my car every morning yet Eustace has remained elusive. Until this morning.   He made his appearance as I'm threading my way along in bumper to bumper traffic. I see him out of the corner of my eye as he dangles from the passenger side visor. Either a piece of web remained or he performed some spider acrobatics and ended up on the rearview mirror. He then scurried back to the visor and disappeared from sight. I suspect now he is hiding above the visor, waiting for dusk so he can rebuild his web.   I've wanted to crack the window in hopes he will crawl away into the wilds of my front yard but the threat of rain has prevented this. Tonight though, Eustace and I will have a show down. He will die in my car, either from lack of food or the heat and as much as I admire him, I really don't want him dropping into my hair in rush hour traffic. I'm afraid I would have to smoosh him.   Heeeere spidey, spidey, spidey....

						   For so long, I have longed to tell you many things. Mainly, that part of me understands you and feels your pain in life. I feel your depression and your anxiety. I don't always understand why you do things... or why you did things, to hurt me. That, I will never understand. No matter the explanation, I will not understand why you did not do something for yourself and why you continue not to.   Perhaps my memory is too long and sharp. Too technicolor. Perhaps it is the pain you inflicted, both mentally and physically, that has driven it so deeply into me that I am now forced through my own intelligence and longing for truth, to extract it from me like a festering thorn. You Mother, are the first layer of the onion.   I remember you slept a lot, were cranky a lot and cried a lot. All signs of depression.  They didn't know that much about depression then... but they do now. And yet, you still refuse help. So, am I to forgive the things you did because you were sick? No, because I know your sickness was not the only reason. It was only part of it, the other part remains hidden from me.   I remember sitting in the floor of my bedroom as you tossed socks and underwear from my suitcase.. I was very little, maybe 6 or 7.. and you were very angry and you yelled very loud and slapped my legs and arms and pulled the little hairs at the nape of my neck. It was because I hadn't unpacked my suitcase when I got home from Ma-Ma's house.. but I had. I just couldn't tell you I had packed it again to run away.   I remember you spanking me and Bubby with a paddle, hard and endlessly for making noise. We weren't fighting, we were playing. I was always slow and nothing I did was right. Nothing any of us did was right.. except Bubby. You told me he was your favorite. You told me more than once. You told me you didn't like me. "There is a difference between like and love Inanna, and I may love you because you're my daughter, but I DON'T LIKE YOU!"    Me? You don't like ME? Perhaps I should have asked you to explain what it was exactly you didn't like.  Fuck you bitch. Jealous mother?  You've always been jealous. What was it? My uber-intelligence? My beauty, my friends...or was it I showed up your son, YOUR FAVORITE in everything. He was a wimp who succumbed to the demands of his friends while I still walked to the beat of a different drummer?    Is that why at awards ceremonies as people would congratulate and talk to you, you always turned the conversation around to my brother? I remember the looks on their faces. Is that why you wrote me that nasty letter my second week in Germany that was so horrid I had a panic attack and had to be taken to the hospital? Is that why you tried to destroy my relationship with my father? Is that why you embarrassed me in front of my friends by being bitter and nasty? Is that why you monopolized the conversation and excluded me when I brought a boyfriend home to meet you?   Or was it my talents? My literary efforts, which won me awards? Is it the fact that I can sing, dance and act and people like it?  Or was it everytime you knocked me down I got right back up again? I never let you break me. Is it because of my preserverence? Is it my strength? What is it about this soul that you find so disagreeable?  What? Oh, I know, I got pregnant out of wedlock to a married man.  And yes, honey, I have paid through blood, sweat, tears and pain, unimaginable sorrow, but he didn't break me either.  He was a piece of cake compared to you. I didn't come crawling did I?   Why give you another reason to twist the knife any deeper? How many times did you need to tell me what a disappointment I was?  Everytime you saw me obviously wasn't enough since you would call and tell me too. And why was it you cried Mother, when I pointed out that I could have had an abortion and you would have been none the wiser?  Because you knew I had that power and chose not to exercise it?   You refused to come to my baby shower because I had been so immoral and to show up meant that you condoned my behavior. Okay. You refused to take pictures of me during the holidays. I don't know why. That must have been immoral too. You showed such disregard when I told you I had gone into labor two months early but luckily they had stopped it. You didn't ask how I was or how the baby was.   I was left to enjoy my pregnancy alone. You did not leech all of my happiness because I was alone everyday with my son. I saw his face on the ultrasound. I loved him regardless of how he came to be or what would happen. I LOVED HIM!! I loved him as he pitched and rolled in my stomach and kicked and hiccuped. I loved the show you put on for my future sister-in-law as he lay hiccuping in the womb and you rubbed my stomach and called him a girl. I thought, "kick her for that." HA! That's what you get for taking what T-Bird said incorrectly, and throwing your little fit and once again, telling me how disappointed you were that she told the sex of the baby.   I almost didn't call you when I was at the hospital. Where I get my compassion I'll never know because it certainly wasn't from you. I know how desparately you wanted to stay and watch the birth. I saw the disappointment when the nurse asked you to leave. Hint: I asked her to do that. Number One: I didn't want you standing around yakking your mouth.  Number Two:  If its so immoral to come to my baby shower and so immoral to take photographs of me, then its obviously too immoral for you to be able to take part in something that you have degraded and besmirched for 6 months.   Had you shown me a little compassion Mother, I may have let you stay. You didn't earn it. You thought only of yourself and how your friends and family felt or how they talked. But not me, flesh of your flesh, your own daugther, when I needed you most. When I was scared and afraid, you turned your back on me and kept it turned until it suited you to turn back around. As far as your compassion extended, so did mine. I don't take any pleasure in kicking you out because I know it hurt you. I may even feel a bit guilty. Just like the guilt I saw in your eyes when you asked me to stand beside my sister-in-law for a picture at HER baby shower. Something dawned on you then, didn't it?  I'd like to say you've changed since the birth of your grandchildren and you have. I think you're a much better grandmother than you ever were a mother. Perhaps I'm not the only one who has learned lessons over the years. I'm glad I gave you the opportunity. It was a toss-up for a while as to whether I allowed my son to be with you. Its worked out.   But, you're still my Mother. And in doing so, you've tried over the years to twist the knife. Like, when you told me you hoped I didn't resent my son due to the circumstances of his birth. I didn't respond until the second time you brought it up. I told you that since you kept talking about it that obviously you were the one who resented it. Case closed.   How about when you asked if the b/f asked me to give my son up if I would? WTF? How can you ask your own daughter, who would give her LIFE for her child, and almost did, if she would give him up? What kind of person does she think I am? She either doesn't know me at all or welcomes any opportunity to throw the things I love and care about in the dark shadow of doubt. NO! YOU DUMB BITCH!! NO MAN IS WORTH MY CHILD! DICK IS NOT WORTH IT! MONEY IS NOT WORTH IT! NOTHING IS WORTH IT!! Case closed.   You still take up for that worthless, spineless, emotionless piece of crap masquerading as my brother. You know, the one who only comes to see you when its convenient for him, when he wants something or so his wife can look down her nose at you but lust after your money, or you can watch their two heathen children while they talk about mine?  But lets not show favortism okay? Because they would be wrong. Really wrong!   Either my meds are working really good or I just don't give a shit anymore. Maybe its the fact that instead of taking your crap now, I stand up to you and tell you to your face that your attitude sucks. I know your actions when I was a child impacted how I saw myself, the types of relationships I gravitated toward as an adult and how I see myself now, which is why I'm writing this and working on myself, because if nothing else, you've taught me what kind of person I don't want to be. If I don't let go of the past, I will be you.   I give you credit though. You've stuck up more for me in the past eight years than you ever did in the first 25. I suppose you feel, grudgingly, that I earned it by dusting myself off again and again and moving on. I earned it long ago Mother and I earned it in your shadow. Your blindness or contempt or jealousy or using me as an outlet for your own unhappiness is not my fault and I refuse to accept it as my responsibility. I have made mistakes and I have made my amends. I forgive you for what you did. I hope to forget and drop the baggage behind me as I move along the path to a better me.   I love you Mom.

						   Driving  They drive so close their auras seep into my car like hazy red stop lights, mixing with blue notes from the radio until the air pulses purple.  I turn my blinker on and slow down, confusing them on this exitless highway.  	EWA  		 - for Troy   You called to ask if I knew what you did that day.  The image of scaling palm trees came to mind, knowing your adventurous spirit.  A ride on a mermaid through silken seas, past alligators lounging in shallows, bored with dragonflies.  Instead, you spoke of the darkness of lost opportunity, your words confusing my feelings.  I wanted to pluck your syllables as they flowed through the phone and rearrange them in a coherent, sensible order, so I might understand them better.  You wanted me to know, you thought yourself a fool for hoping where hope should not lie, but without admitting that you hoped at all.  I rearranged your words and sent them back in no reasonable order so you would know - there is no coherency, sensibility or reasonableness - when you are lost.

						   I hide  in the closet and escape  the thundering voices the lightning quick flashes  of insanity  In the closet I go unnoticed I cannot feel  their thoughts their words cannot  puncture me their anger cannot  infect me  I hide from yellowed skin forked tongues dripping fangs striking and hissing like cobras in duet  I hide  afterward I crawl peeking through the crack light on my face, careful the door doesn’t creak I quell the light dark and hushed then I notice the closet door 	 is ajar  Tiptoe, tiptoe so dark within green tentacles reaching I slam the door and run! I peep from beneath the covers you know there are monsters  in the closet

						   Look at your hands Now imagine  you have no fingernails None the ends are smooth and round now imagine  there is something slick on the end of your fingers Rub it around  Before you is an onion Its very large Its white It is not sweet It will burn  You must peel the onion  It is trussed in its shell the decaying outer shell But you cannot harm the onion  How will you peel it? You have no nails You have no knife Your fingers are slick  How will you peel it?  There is always a flaw a crack, a fissure and you will work your finger around it it will be difficult You must be patient For you may not harm the onion  You must rub the shiny dead skin along the crack, the flaw until it opens And then you will cry Remember The onion is not sweet The onion will burn  Every layer  of the onion  must be peeled.   It is tedious  It is time consuming It is frustrating It burns It makes you cry but you must not harm the onion  You may not toss it the air You may not smash it on the table you may not use a knife Nor a nail Nor anything sharp for the onion is fragile  Time is what the onion needs Every layer  is thicker and harder every layer will burn every layer will make you cry but you must not harm the onion  In the onion  there is a core it is the most fragile It is the sweetest part of the onion it will not make you cry  As you cup it in your hands you realize you’ve spent so much time peeling the onion the other pieces  the outer shell  are withering and dying  And you are left with the sweet core  Peel your onion but do not harm the onion for it contains your sweetest core

						   Insincerity and insecurity, one caused by the other, neither realizing which starts first.  We cloak ourselves behind and find the way around the insecurity, when we are together.  The insincerity is dropped but as we part it is assumed the insincerity continues and it is shameful how we let that wall down.  The kitten claws my lap, indifferent to my pleas.  As indifferent as you. My voice must be infinitesimal although I hear myself speak, perhaps only in my mind. Indefinite time frames shrink my voice and my irritation is intense.  Which is the infidel? The one that betrays their mate?  The one who betrays themself?  The pagan, the saint, the sinner?  Intentional disregard of confusion, is that a sign or is it really just disregard?  Are you really so inane or are you just really good at ignoring?  Perhaps I’m like the inch-worm, interesting to watch but not something you want crawling on your skin nor under.  Infatuation is fed, not smothered, as insane notions should be. Information has been passed on a one-way street and I make no further inquiries to obtain insight.  Meandering along this path with no real destination, waiting only for the inevitable, wondering if our differences are too incongruent to be overcome.  Indecisiveness at your insolence leaves me like the kitten on my lap, indolent, tired of clawing, and pacing and purring and narrowing my eyes against the sun. I put on my sunglasses and ponder the infinite.

						   Even pressed between the bodies, I am alone.  Heartbeats out of synch, its mine that cannot find the rhythm.  My foot taps on the floor, bells on my fingers but my heart stays out of time.  I feel them touching my body and she is eager but my soul turns and hides and yearns. I pluck at the edge of the mattress, I feel their heat, their murmurs and soft laughs vibrating through my nakedness, the long pauses and sighs of kisses and caresses.  Soon...they will turn to me and she will join them, delighted in her wantonness.  They touch the underside of her breast and suckle her excited nipples, their fingers buried inside her lushness, their mouths, tongues, teeth and I hear her moan from far away.  She is pliant and eager, she burns and is unafraid and they catch her fever, smoldering to crescendo.  Rumbles of laughter, smoke drifting with the scent of sex behind this closed door.  They try to cuddle but she turns from them,  in  to  me    and I feel their withdrawal from the chill and I enjoy it.   The scorpion poised to strike, to flood them with pain, to hide and sulk.  She may give in to them but I am in control. I confuse them.  I have to let them know.  They may possess her but they will never have her, not all of her, she is only half without me. They have to know, I hate them.  When they touch her hair and she may smile but inside she fights me.  I want to scowl - I hate their touch, I hate how they touch and feel and I feel nothing.  I hate the look of yearning and passion in their eyes.  Fake!   Its   Not    Real!  A soul that burns with hate, with fear, with jealousy...with pain, is particular. THEY pretend, I will not.  I wish she would tell them how it means NOTHING! to me. I want to see the pain in their eyes. I want to see confusion and hate. I want them to understand me by being me. But she is silent and leaves me to pout.

						   Isn't that just a fucking lovely way to start my post for this evening??  I was all set to tell you about a wonderful book that I bought today but wouldn't ya know?  I left the fucker at work and I soooo wanted to read it this evening!!!  That just goes with what else the post is about anyway.  The book is called, "The Tale of the Devil - A biography of Devil Anse Hatfield."  If you haven't heard of the Hatfields and McCoys feud you are not from this planet, please go back from whence you came in peace.  Okay, maybe its a just an American thing so all Canadians, South Africans and Australians may stay.  I believe those are the folks who visit.  Anyway, the Hatfield-McCoy feud is pure WV/KY history.  Its especially interesting to me as my ancestors intermarried with both clans in the 1800's.  None of my direct ancestors did but some of their progency did.  After all, its all about family here.  I've only made it through the preface or introduction or whatever they called it and the first chapter.  Normally, I don't read the preface to any book. However, this one was quite interesting.  It chronicles the migration of pioneers into the Appalachian mountains, tells about the geography (I remember that the average grade of an Appalachian mountain is 45% and the New River is thought to be the oldest river in the world.)  and what sorts of folks could make it in the harsh, harsh land that was the Appalachians of the 1800's.  The Appalachians were once thought to be higher than the Himalayans but through time and erosion they are now shorter than the Rockies.   It is not unusual when hiking in the high dense forests of WV to come across fossils... of seashells.  My dad found a huge block of sandstone once in Pocahontas County, an Eastern border county which had probably 100 seashell fossils in it.  Its amazing to me to know that WV and all these mountains once stood under water.   The book also goes on to explain why the Mountaineers were such clannish and private folk (and still are).  Its because they came here, like most others, to escape religious persecution.  Most were of Scotch-Irish descent.  Meaning they were originally Scottish and were forced into Northern Ireland as the unwanted and eventually migrated to the Colonies.  My family though were French and came basically for the same reason.   The term "hillbilly," which causes we Mountaineers to cringe, is actually an endearment of sorts as the Scottish word for friend is "billy."  Friends of the hills, yes, that's us.  Just don't put your shanty up within shoutin' distance of ours and we'll be fine.   I will post more about Devil Anse Hatfield as I read the book.  One of his great-great-granddaughters was a client of ours and she certainly took her role as a Hatfield to heart.  I know already that he was born about 10 years before my great-grandmother who is mentioned in my June post about Jesse James.  He was a skilled hunter and equestrian.  This book was written by one of his descendants and I'll get that information when I get the damn book from the office.  Which leads me to the next thing.  I have medical conditions known as depression and anxiety. I hate them.  I had my first real depressive/anxiety episode before leaving for Germany when I was 17, which was par for the course I believe.  The next was after, well, Gabriel was born.  Ah shit, his name is Nate.  My son's name is Nate.  Pffffffft!!  Anyway, it was bad and I blew it off to post-partum but it was full blown depression.   The next episode was while the Drunk Boyfriend lived here.  My grandfather died unexpectedly, 9/11, dealing with a drunk, dealing with Nate and his dad's abuse... I finally went on medication.  Thank you, it worked very well.  It was Wellbutrin.  I know it caused some folks problems but for me, it was a dream drug.  I was Queen of the World.  Eventually, I weaned myself off and was doing okay, except I noticed that it became more difficult to focus and concentrate.  I just worked harder.  When my next depressive episode hit about two months ago, I was in agony and kept trying to muck and muddle through but knew I needed medication again.  I did.  This time they put me on Lexapro.  Cool stuff.  My depression and especially my anxiety are well under control on the lowest dose.  Just one problem.  The attention and concentration problems which I attributed to the depression are not gone.  If anything, being clearer minded from the lack of depression, I'm noticing them more.  I took an Adult ADD questionaire online.   Let's just say, it doesn't look good.  I'm a classic textbook case.  My symptoms range from moderate to Whoa-you-really-got-a-problem.  Since Nate was diagnosed with ADHD, I suspected that I was the source.  Just to describe what its like:  If I like something, I will do until I'm blue in the face, which is called - hyperfocus.  For example, blogging.  If I don't, then I have to force myself to do it and most of the time, don't get it done, like, oh say, housework.  I live in a perpetual state of clutter.  Clutter everywhere, everywhere, everywhere.  I have been mucking through at work, severely under producing, which my boss has noticed.  Other symptoms of Adult ADD include, gasp!, depression, anxiety and low self-esteem. Imagine that!!  Not to mention, you forget shit!!  Like, oh, that brand new fucking book I bought that I'm dying to read!!!  And folks, let me tell you, my mind, never, ever fucking shuts up.  Never.  I do stupid shit like memorize license plates of cars and then look for the cars on my way to and from work.  It keeps my mind busy.  I daydream constantly.  I will re-read the same medical record ten times before I write one sentence.  And my mind runs and runs and runs.  It just never shuts up.  I was sleeping better when I started the Lexapro but now... forget it.  Now, I will be exhausted and lay down in the bed and "bing" my eyes are open, I'm tossing and turning because my mind WON'T SHUT UP!!!!  I don't obsess on one thing, I think about a million and they turn over and over and over in my mind, like a fucking B movie.  So, what's the damn difference between Wellbutrin and Lexapro??  Wellbutrin is a second line medication for Adult ADD.  While I took it, it took away my symptoms.  When I went off, I was functioning okay, just had to work a little harder or maybe a lot harder but I didn't have the depression.  Now, the Lexapro is bringing everything into focuse but is not a medication for ADD so, here I am, now I'm well enough to realize that I'm still fucked up.  Isn't life just grand?  I called around and found a doctor that specializes in Adult ADD and made an appointment for an intake and testing.  I hope he can help me.  I'm so sick of being this way.  Its been almost 34 years and I think that's long enough.  I just want to be able to go to work and do a good job, clean my house and spend time with my son.  I really hope he can help me.   By the way, I posted some new pics on my photoblog.  Enjoy!

						   It was not the greatest day, although it could have been worse.  I was tired all day because I sat up until 1:30 this morning writing to AZ.  I hope what I said gets his head out of his ass.  I think I used those words too.  Keep in mind that I love AZ very much as a friend.  Sometimes I love him as more than a friend but for right now, I'm all up in the friend thing.  We've watched each other make some pretty foolish choices and one in particular on his part I watched go down and wanted so much to step in and say, "Man, you're fucking up. This chick is psycho."  But I didn't because honestly, I didn't think he would have listened.  He debates otherwise.  Anyway, when things finally came to a head, I told him what I had thought and he asked, "why didn't you say anything?  You're the third person to say that."   So, from that point on I decided to tell him what I saw and how I saw it in order to save him the time and expense and bullshit of figuring it out.  And you know, that never fucking works.  Nevertheless.... I am putting my best bitchy foot forward and telling him like it is... about him.  No, he's not on drugs, he's not an alcoholic or any of that crap.  By outward appearances, he looks quite normal and acts quite normal.  Ahhhh my children, but what lies beneath??  Some phrases I used included the aforementioned "get your head out of your ass," "Wake the fuck up dude," and "why are you so fucking stubborn?"  I'm a great friend aren't I?  Trust me, if I use those phrases it means I love you and care about you and am "tired of watching you piss away the best parts of yourself. "  He's done it for me, although he didn't have to use any words, he said all of that and more with just one look.  I feel as though I'm just returning the favor, one friend to another.  Although, I have to say, it sucks.   The whole situation just sucks and I have no idea if I'm making things better or worse.  Guess I'll find out next week.  I had a lunch date today with the Bald UPS Guy.  Sissy was so excited for me until she found out it wan't the muscular skinny Bald UPS Guy but the older, heavier Bald UPS Guy.  Lord, you should have seen her face... I felt like such a loser.  The lunch date was okay.  The conversation wasn't all that great.  He seemed like a nice guy and he's been flirting with me forever.  BUT... here's where the guys can roll their eyes and tell me to get a clue.  He asked when he could see me again and I told him next Tuesday.  I seriously have to get my ass in gear at work, my boss is not a happy man, which means, I'll be eating in the office.  Second, this is my weekend with my son and I don't go out unless its a special, special occasion when I have  him.  Third, on the following Monday, Gabriel, as I will now call Hyper-Boy (please make note of it) has a doctor's appointment.   Now, Bald UPS Guy says, "What, I can't see you sooner than that??"  Uh... no.  That irritated me. I don't play games and I'm not coy.  If I said "next Tuesday" I meant, "next Tuesday."  I gave him the appreviated version as to why that is as I didn't feel as though after one lunch date I owed a formal one.  I just hate that.  Now, I know that some guys are sitting out there going, "but he's just interested in you."  Well, get a clue Mr. Interested, have some respect for what I just said.  Second, I picked up the newspaper and noticed when the first WVU game is going to be and mentioned I needed to get cable so I could watch the games without snow on the screen.  He said, "No you don't, you can just watch the game on my big screen TV."  Uh... no.  Guess it didn't dawn on him that I may have my own set of friends that I watch football with.  I don't like being rushed and that made me feel rushed.  I don't know, it just hit me the wrong way.  Like he's taking a lot for granted.   I just wasn't feeling it.  There was no spark.  I did agree to have lunch with him next week as I have been encouraged to "give it a try."  I will go with an open mind and just be myself and see what happens.  Okay, I'll try to do those things but if I don't feel comfortable after the second date, I'm calling it off.

						   One Fall day, I went to my parent's farm.  In my photoblog, below the picture of the red paperbox, is a photo of the top meadow above the point.  A geographic  point , for reference, is a projecting or tapering piece of land. If you blow that picture up you would be able to see the barn that sits to the left of the gate, even though the gate is not visible.  From where I stood, if you were to look directly to your left, there would be a path/road which goes between the hunting cabin and the top meadow.  There is a also a small pond a few steps further down the hill.  On this particular day, I took my son and oldest nephew on a hike.  My intention that day was to find a piece of wood suitable to making a wand.  I wanted oak and they are plentiful.  We walked up the hollow, passed the pond and up to pond meadow.  This is where I asked for and received permission to take a long wand-looking branch from a white oak.  My dad came up on his 4-wheeler and took the boys back to the house with him.  As I walked from the hunting cabin to the top meadow, I saw a doe.  She seemed quite flustered as I stalked her.  As though I could hurt her at this point.  The following is an excerpt of a letter which I wrote to AZ that evening -  "After I finished stalking the poor doe, I circled back to the small pond hidden in the shadows.  Sometimes you will find a deer there but there were none.  That trails opens out onto the largest flat where hay grows in the summertime.  Now, it is so green, like a painting, the flat ringed by russets and deep golds, not the yellows of the maples, but a gold, like the chesnut or even beech.  They stick up like drying paint brushes against the sky, the sun shining but not hot like July or August. An Indian Summer sun.  You can hear the wind in the valley and the trees breath deeply and begin to sway with its rhythm.  At first, its just a breeze on your face until the entire forest expels it like the breath of the gods and it lifted the hair off my shoulders.  I'm standing on top of that mountain and I feel like I can fly.  Its so perfect, it hurts.  Its so beautiful, I never want it to end.  I wish you could have been there.  I wish you could have inhaled the scent of a dying Fall, Summer is long past gone.  The scent of a freshly cut oak branch, musty leaves, a hint of snow.  I wish you could have soaked the sun into your skin with me.  I wish you could have twirled around on that mountaintop with me because no one could see us.  Then walk slowly down to the gate and then run back up to the top of the hill again, just to see it all again, just to feel like you were King of the World."  I wrote a poem about Fall which my German father translated into German for me. It's hanging on the wall in my house and I do have a copy on my other computer.  Alas, you will have to wait for that. It reminds me a lot of what I wrote to AZ that day although it was written ten years earlier.  That's all I have to say today. May you have a King of the World day!

						   After laboring most of yesterday, my photoblog now has 36 photos.  I forgot to include the color pics from my bike ride, they will be added soon.  You may ask why there are more pics of my cats than my kid. Well, that's because HB takes my camera and... TAKES PICTURES OF THE CATS!  Regan commented that she had been thinking about making a photoblog.  Well, I hope whoever feels like it does.  I know Sloth and Dastard both are very good photographers and we, bloggers collectively, would enjoy seeing more of their work as well as everyone elses.  Why?  Because we're nosy and curious about the peeps who we read about.... so photoblog away!!!  I had a most interesting experience last night or rather, this morning.  At 4:10, by my clock, I was awakened by someone hollering my name.  They sounded like they were in my house and it sounded like  my brother ?  WTF?  Of course it wasn't.  It was my neighbor, Hagar, as he is seen on my photoblog, bellowing from his open window to my open window.  Why?  Because he's drunk and he wants me to have a beer with him.  Yeah.  So, I know the Missus is out of town with her sisters.  I also can tell from listening to him that he's not as drunk as he wants me to believe.  I hate that.  Now, Hagar and his Missus and a bunch of other friends and I have partied together.  We've played every variation of strip games there are.  Strip poker, strip Uno, strip Trivial Pursuit, we've skinny dipped together.  Of course, there has been some slap and tickle to go along with that.  BUT, his Missues has always been RIGHT THERE.  It was all in the name of fun and she knows I have no designs on him for sex or otherwise.  I don't drink on the meds that I'm taking now.  I found out the hard way that it feels like I've taken four muscle relaxers and drank a fifth of vodka.  Not good.  Plus, its 4 fucking a.m. and his wife is not home.  NO FUCKING WAY!!  And he keeps fucking up and acting drunk and then not slurring his words appropriately.  This is pissing me off.   I hope if I ignore him, he will go away.  He doesn't.  He comes outside and tells me he's fallen and can't get up.  I holler out my window that its a nice night and he won't die of exposure.  He tells me he's going to "irritate you, irritate, irritate" until I come over.  I feel like I'm Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost as Patrick Swayze is singing, "I'm Henry the 8th I am."  I get up, smoke a cigarette, check my e-mail, use the bathroom and go back to bed.  This is when he asks if I will give him a boob shot.  NO.  Half a boob?  NO.  Quarter of a boob?  NO.  See, blonde or not, I knew what the "let's have a drink" was about.  Damn fucker.  You're probably wondering why I just didn't shut the window.  It was a beautiful night.  It was cool, in the upper 50's and the sounds of the night are soothing.  Eventually, that's what I did though.  That really pissed me off.  Seemed like the temp in my room went up 10 degrees and it left a hollowness.  The upside is, Hagar shut up and went home as opposed to resorting to banging on my windows or doors.  I would have called the cops if he did that.   Luckily, my cats slept through this and I went back to sleep without much tossing or turning, but ended up oversleeping this morning.  I hate that.  I'm plotting revenge now, and, I'm telling his wife.

						   That's right all you bloggers and lurkers.... I have created a photoblog which is linked to the left.  I have uploaded some of my b & w photos like the ones below and some of my cats.  I'm still working on uploading and downloading 5 discs of pictures to pick from to post.  So, check back often.  I will posting pics of Hyper-Boy, my parent's farm, more from my trip on the North Bend Rail Trail and others.  I might even post a real ugly picture of me I took this morning with my kitties... if you're lucky.  Hope everyone is having or had a great weekend.

						   I just read Dastard's post about life's discontent.  He did not leave the comments section up, which I can understand.  Sometimes when I post I secretly hope that everyone reads it, but no one says anything.  I just wanted Dastard to know that he is not alone in sometimes wanting to miss the exit and keep going.  When things get bad, I think of packing only what I can carry, including the kid and the cats, and moving to the Midwest somewhere, where no one knows anything about me.  I would work as a waitress in a truck stop where my son could do his homework sitting in a corner booth as truckers pique my imagination with stories of the road.  I would be their favorite waitress of every truck stop.  I would remember all of their names and ask about their wives and girlfriends and kids, pets and wild happenings. And they wouldn't know anything about me.  I would live in a silver Aerostream trailer with pink flamingos in the yard.  My son and I would take walks across the flat dusty land and forget we ever lived before.  We would live in the moment of grasshoppers and a setting sun as 18-wheelers rumble past.  When people would interfere and insinuate themselves in our lives, as people do, we would simply pack up the Aerostream and leave one night with the moonlight as our guide.  We would find ourselves somewhere in Montana, where I would cook for the cowboys and even wrangle a few steer myself.  I would laugh and joke with them as they told cowboy stories and deftly burn my finger or knock the salt over when they would ask questions about me.  I would learn to hunt from a saddle and my son would just learn to ride and rope.  Then someone would attempt to tell me what to do or how to live my life and all they would see are the tail lights from the Aerostream as we bump down the dirt road to once again follow the moonlight.  Perhaps the coast of Maine would be our next stop. I would trade the Aerostream for a ship. We would eat clam chowder and trap lobsters.  Every evening we would practice nautical knots and wash the salt from our skin.  We would lay on the boat as it is buffeted by the north wind and see all the stars and learn how to navigate in the fog. Our cheeks would glow from the chapping gale, our hands calloused and rough from working the ropes.  One evening we would simply set sail in the moonlight and not return.  Eventually we would see the porpoises who play off the coast of the Outer Banks.  There we would make port and I would sell the ship and find another Aerostream and finally allow the call of the lush forests of home to beckon us back. What will have changed?  Probably nothing, as humans are creatures of habit.  We do everyday the same things we did the day before. We awake the same time everyday, we go to work, we come home, we cook, we clean, we make love, we sleep. This routine is called security.  Our dependence for order and stability.  It is both comforting and irritating. We are happy in it, and loathe it. We feel compelled to grow up and make order from chaos. We feel compelled to remain in relationships and jobs, to deal with our families and still carry that drunk friend home so as to maintain that order.   We breathe in oxygen which nourishes our blood which in turn nourishes our bodies, this place where our soul is so graciously allowed to reside.  At some point everyday we realize we are hungry and we eat to maintain our strength and our health.  How often though we ignore the hunger of our souls.  It does not grumble and lower our blood sugar. It does not interrupt our meetings or suddenly hit like the munchies. There are no late night drive-thrus for soul nourishment. We have yoga and Quabbalah classes, we got to church and synagouge, we dance in circles and it all becomes another part of the order in our lives.  Our soul's hunger is the deepest hunger. It knaws at us slowly until one day we wake up as Dastard did, wondering what happened to our dreams and this life that we planned.  Our order is upset because its not our order anymore.  We have begun to walk to the beat of someone else's drummer.  Sometimes, we don't hear our own drumbeat anymore.   Dastard, you're not alone. I can offer no advice, only empathy. I know I'm the only one who can take control of my life and I'm doing that with baby steps. I extent my hand to you in friendship and wish you "Good Luck."

						    I Am Not Alone   Luckily, the people in my life are just as spirit prone as I am.  The following stories I either witnessed or participated in or were told to me.  On some, I'm sure I'm not 100% sure of all the details but I will try to be as accurate as possible.   The Haint   Yes, that is haint, not haunt.  I refer to it as an ancient Appalachian word and possibly no one outside of Appalachia has heard this before.  A haint is a banshee-like creature, mostly myth and folklore.  Redneckin' Dictionary of Common Terms refers to it as an "archiac rural for spooks, ghosts."  I stand by the opinion that it is more banshee like.   My friend G.G.  lived off a holler, off a holler, off a holler (that's  hollow  for you city folk) and before I ever came to know them, they had a haint.  This haint would cry and wail at night time and stalk around their house.  One night, her Uncle Jinks and her grandfather Tex rounded it up  under  the house and shut it up inside.  She said the floorboards of their house rattled as it pitched and fought to get free.  It raised quite a stink and she said every hair on her body stood at attention.  It eventually fought its way free, how I'll never know, and eventually it left.  Some folks believe a haint is actually your conscience.  When you have a bad conscience the haint will follow you.  I have a different theory of this particular haint, which I will relate next.   The Indians   One day I was sitting on G.G.'s porch enjoying whatever breeze would blow out of the mountains.  Over a period of time, G.G's mom had been telling me about growing up in the area and how different it was now.  She said G.G. should take me up past the old horse barn to where they had bulldozed to see if we could find any arrowheads as they had found a lot when it was first cut.  That thought was far from my mind until I happen to look across the road and into the mountain.   It wasn't the same mountain anymore.  It was brushier, the road was gone and the creek ran differently.  Coming down a small footpath was a tribe of indians.  They walked single file carrying packs.  I watched as long as I could and when I blinked the vision was gone.  I realized then that the house was probably built on or very near an Indian burial ground.  Certainly Indians had lived in that area as evidenced by finding all of the arrowheads.  That would certainly explain, not just the haint, but the other odd occurrences that kept cropping up around there.    Footsteps   One night while at G.G.'s I left her bedroom and went to use the bathroom which was directly off the kitchen.  G.G.'s house had wood floors that creaked so you knew when someone was up and about.  I had just sat down to use the bathroom when I heard the footsteps come through the house.  I figured G.G. was lying in wait to scare me.  When I came out of the bathroom I looked quickly left and right.  The front door was directly to my right and a countertop.  Nothing.  I stealthed my way through the rest of the house, checking darkened doorways to find, nothing.   When I got back to the bedroom, G.G. was laying in the bed and I looked at her oddly.  I asked if she had come through the house.  She said no, that she thought it was me.  Then we accused each other of playing a trick on the other one then decided, "We're not alone."  She got her gun and we searched every corner of that house.  Her mom was in the far back bedroom, fast asleep.  Whoever it was had walked through the house behind me and then through the front door, well, without opening the door of course.   That  still gives me chills.  I always suspected that it was Pa-Pa Tex, who had died the same year I was born.  A friend helped in confirming this.   The Walk-Through   A girlfriend of mine in college could actually see ghosts and offered to come out to G.G.'s house to wander through and see what she could see and what energies she picked up.  Needless to say, they weren't good.  She described the feeling that she was not wanted there and that something very evil lurked about.  She said "the man in the kitchen" kept watch over these spirits and kept them at bay.  She described him in grey work pants, an old plaid red shirt with old black thick-framed glasses.  There are no pictures of Pa-Pa Tex anywhere in that house, except photo albums, yet she described him perfectly from the pictures that I had seen.  Further, Bek, had recurring dreams for most of her childhood and young adult life about the very road that we traveled and the house that G.G. lived in.  She stopped having the dream about the time that G.G. and I became friends and  I  began traveling the road.    Ivy   Ivy was my big chocolate Lab who I tried to take everywhere with me.  She and Bek made another trip to G.G.'s but this time they stayed in the car while I went in to get some things I had forgotten.  G.G. was working out of town and happened to call while I was there.  I went to stand at the kitchen door and waved to them then moved away to hang the phone up.  I heard Ivy pitch a fit.  She didn't normally do that when I left her sight as she was trained not to.  (She was a Search and Rescue dog at the time.)   When I went out to the car, Bek asked who had been there with me.  I told her just me and G.G.'s mom.  She asked if Uncle Jinks was there and I told her no.  She said the reason Ivy started barking was because once I stepped away a man came to the door, looked out, waved and then walked away.  Pa-Pa Tex again.    AZ    AZ knows what kind of beliefs I have as I have written him several times about my experiences.  He's never offered much back until one day on the phone he said, "I had visitors last night."  I asked who and he told me he had no idea but they wouldn't let him sleep.  Oh,  those  kinds of visitors.  He related that he had laid down to sleep and kept hearing thumps in his kitchen. When he got up and turned the light on they stopped.   This went back and forth a few times until AZ got his gun and actually went into the kitchen.  Now, the thought of AZ carrying a gun around looking for spirits in his underwear was just funny.  I asked him what he thought he was going to do with the gun.  He told me he didn't know but they shut up and left him alone.  I told him it was probably because they were laughing so hard.  I said, "next time, just let them know that you hear them, thank them for coming and tell them you need to get some sleep."   The Bible and the Deer   Before my grandparents died, I recieved signs that their time was near.  This is my mother's parents, who I was closer to than my dad's parents.  Before my Ma-Ma died, I had been to see her in the hospital when she had her dialysis shunt implanted.  When I walked into the room, my Pa-Pa was sitting on the bed with her, holding her hand and they were both crying.  I visited for a bit, talked to the nurses and left.  I got turned around in the hospital and ended up in the chapel.  I walked over to the Bible, moved all the change off of it, closed it, opened it and stuck my finger down while thinking about my grandmother.  I read the passage.  It spoke of taking someone to the mountains so the angels could carry them into heaven.  She died three months later.  On Christmas Day 2003, I went to visit my Pa-Pa as I had missed the big family gathering the night before.  As we sat in his kitchen, I saw a doe come out of the woods and down the hill.  Pa-Pa moved from window to window, telling me how she would come out of the woods at the bottom of the hill, cross the dirt road, go through the neighbor's yard and up the other mountain.   We stepped out onto their sunporch, the one from my meditation yesterday, to watch.  The doe did not go across the road.  She turned and came up the driveway, then onto the bank, until she was less than five feet from us.  My Pa-Pa was talking about what a sassy deer that was.  I had tears in my eyes because  I knew  it was not just any deer.  I knew it was, well, my Ma-Ma.  Her spirit or something.  It was her way of telling me that she was never far and she would return for him soon.  He died four months later.   The T.V.   One day, Hyper-Boy, his half-sister Aim, and her mom, Lori, and I were out running around and had come back to my place.  The kids had been really good but they were starting to get a little loud and I thought that maybe I should turn the TV for distraction.  No sooner had the thought crossed my mind, the TV turned on.   Lori looked over at me and said, "I hate it when you do that."  But I didn't do anything, I just thought about it and someone happened to be walking past and turned it on.  (The remote was lost in the attic for the first three years I lived here and it still doesn't have batteries in it.)    The Planes   On September 10, 2001, Drunk Boyfriend and I had just gotten into the bed when the sound of jet engines rushed between my house and the nabes next door.  It rattled the windows and shook the water in the waterbed.  DB jumped up and ran outside.  He said the night was as still as could be, not a cloud nor plane in the sky.   We all know what happened September 11th.  DB called me at work and he brought up the odd sound we had heard the night before.  He said, "do you realize that maybe what we heard last night was the last thing that some of those people heard in the WTC?"  I didn't want to think about it.   I would have passed that off to coincidence did it not happen again.  The night of January 31, 2003, I had a similar experience.  The next day, the space shuttle Columbia disentegrated on re-entry.   I had a false alarm earlier this year.  Let's hope another sign like that, never comes true.   Thanks for reading everyone.  I'm going to take a few days off and catch up on reading blogs, my regulars and some new ones.  I'll also be updating my links.  When I return, I'll be posting about a question my mother asked me about spirits and awareness of things around us.  In the meantime, remember, "when the little hairs on the back of your neck stand up, its them."

						    The Beginning   When I was about 8 or 9 years old,  I awoke one night.  I sat up in the bed and looked through the doorway to the ajoining room where my brother slept.  We had a little table with two chairs that sat directly in front of the closet doors.  There was a little boy sitting in one of the chairs, playing with something.  It was not my brother.  I crawled to the end of the bed to get a better look.  He turned and looked at me, got up and walked through the closet door.  That's right,  through  the door.  I waited and waited for him to come back, but he never did.  I remember asking my mom later if any children had ever died in the house as we were not the first people to ever live there.  I remember reading something about spirits staying where they were comfortable, even at my young age.   I don't think my mom really believed I ever saw him, that it was a dream or something.  Funny that I can't remember any dreams from that time in my life but I still know what that little boy looks like.    Personal Experiences    Just so everyone knows, I'm not trying to convince anyone of anything.  Everyone has their own beliefs and should be comfortable with them.   On with the show.  I've had many encounters with "The Other Side."  Spirits or ghosts, if you want to use that term.  I don't.  I'll try to pick out the most significant encounters.  The single most significant encounter was with my Ma-Ma.  She died in April 1999.  My Ma-Ma and I were very, very close.  It took us a while to get there but when we did, it was a beautiful relationship.  I watched her suffer and slowly slip away, heart and kidney disease robbing her of the things she loved to do most.  She loved to cook big dinners, sit on her porch and visit with her family.  At the end, her family had to do for her.  After her death, I laid in the bed, meditating.  In my meditation,  I put myself on her porch.  Meditation is hard for me.  Its difficult to actually  put  myself somewhere, where I'm looking out of my own eyes at everything instead of looking at myself somewhere, if I explained that correctly.  But I did this time.  I love the autumn, so I made sure it was that time of year.  The air was crisp, the mountains were full of deep fall colors but the sun was warm.  I was drowsy and relaxed with my feet up, my eyes half shut, when I saw a movement across my field of sight. I looked to my left and my Ma-Ma was sitting beside of me.  She smiled and laughed.  Boy, did she have a goofy laugh!!!  I would have known it anywhere!!   She didn't speak and neither did I.  I felt such love and happiness from her and within myself.  I knew she was okay.  That's all I needed.   Another experience happened while I was in Germany in 1998.  Besides feeling the entire time that I had lived there in another lifetime, I developed the worst case of strep throat.  I was so sick that I stayed in a type of suspended animation for a three or four days.  I remember looking at my host sister, knowing who she was but not being able to remember her name.  I had posters all over the wall across from my bed, where every morning I could wake up and see Jon Bon Jovi's smiling face.  But as I tossed and turned one morning, I looked up to the wall and saw all the faces, but none of them were rock stars.   They were very worried faces and I could hear them chattering back and forth amongst themselves.  It was as though I had a whole army of people watching over me.  I wasn't frightened by them at all.  I wrote it off as hallucination until The Medium, who I will describe in another segment.  When the Drunk Boyfriend lived here in 2001, a series of intense things happened relating to Hyper-Boy.  Hyper-Boy's father was hitting the skids and the bottle HARD.  I had no idea at the time though that he was physically and emotionally abusing my son, but my Ma-Ma made sure that I found out.   The first thing that happened is that I began to sense that she was near.  My Ma-Ma was a very strong woman and her spirit was just as strong.   I kept having a vision of her from my past.  I was probably 12-14 years old at the time and she had become very angry with my grandfather for being gone too long.  She became so angry she jumped in the air and threw her cigarette case down on the floor and cussed, something she never did.  I began having this vision very frequently as I walked through my living room.  I sensed very strongly she was angry about something.   The second in this series of occurrences was Hyper-Boy's half-sister, who I would occasionally take to school.  She came in one morning about dawn.  Normally she would crash on the couch until time for us to get up but that morning she came straight to my bedroom.  I was half awake and wanting to doze off for another half of an hour until she said, "Inanna, there's a lady outside your house.  She's mad.  I think its Hyper-Boy's grandmother."  Yeah, I woke up.  She described her as a grey haired lady and she was jumping.   She opined that perhaps she was just coming to check on him like her grandmother did her at school.  Her grandmother has been dead for 20 years.   Drunk Boyfriend and I worked separate shifts so as I was coming, he was going and vice versa.  I didn't mention the lights coming on, the noises at night or the grandmotherly sense, although  his family were believers themselves.  After one night though, I had to tell him.  I was laying in bed with Hyper-Boy when my dog at the time,  a little Yorkie named Jessie, started growling.  The house was dark but I couldn't hear anything that would cause her to growl.  I sat up in the bed as she looked out my bedroom door.  There is a small field of vision between my doorway, the hallway wall and the living room.  I saw a hovering light over the chair.   I have a picture window in my living room with dark maroon curtains which I keep closed 99.99% of the time.  That window faces away from traffic as I live on a one-way street.  At the time, I had a big Lab in the backyard that barked at his own shadow and the window is too far off the ground for anyone to shine a flashlight in and if anyone tried, Nick would have barked his head off.  The best way I can describe the light is a hovering large spark, like one from a Roman candle with sparks coming out from it but not pulsing.  I was transfixed, afraid to blink and not to mention, for the first time, a little scared.   I'm used to lights coming on by themselves and the TV has turned on by itself.  None of that scared me, but that light did.  It heightened something in me.  The next morning, I met Drunk Boyfriend at the door and told him about it.  He sat down on the bed and said, "You know, I haven't said anything but things have been weird lately."  He related laying in the bed and hearing the sound of a cat jumping off of my kitchen counter, knowing that my cat was outside and his was laying in the bed next to him.  When he would get up, there would be nothing there.  Jessie would wake him up whining and growling, just as she had me.  He got the feeling he was being watched, he would wake up and the bedroom light would be on... on and on.   When Hyper-Boy finally told on his dad and I took him to court for custody, it all stopped.  There's more, but I will save them for a later post.   The Medium   Through T-Bird, I met a guy I will call Frank.  I didn't know it at the time but Frank was a medium.  I'm careful with people who claim such things, believer or not.  He seemed genuinely uncomfortable in my presence.  He told T-Bird's mom, KC, that she had a lot of spirits around her.  He told T-Bird after meeting me he had never encountered a person with so many spirits around them.  He said I made KC look like a lonely person.  He said the people I had around me filled the room and stretched around the block, like a popular club or something.  Frank was overwhelmed by my spirits.   Frank told me things about myself and the people in my life that made my skin crawl, for days.  It got to the point we couldn't even chat on the computer.  It became uncomfortable for me even, as a certain coldness would creep around me until I had to use a blanket just to sit at the computer.  The kicker was when he told me about being sick in Germany (his words were - sick in a faraway place) and that my spirits had watched over me and revealed themselves.  Even as a believer, I found that hard to fathom.  I had not told  anyone  about what happened except my host family.    The Spirit Carriers   For lack of a beter word, I suppose I am a spirit carrier.  Someone who takes a legion of otherwordly beings wherever I go.  Which is fine with me.  Sometimes I know they are around and when I've needed them, they haven't let me down.  When I go, they go with me and I try to bring them all back too.  Sometimes though, spirits get "dropped off" or just decide not to leave for a while.  T-Bird lived with me for three months in 2000.  One night we were sitting in my living room, our children asleep in their respective bedrooms when we heard a baby cry.  A baby.  Not a four year old and a toddler, a baby.  We both said, "Little T."  I was to be Little T's godmother.  Before I left Michigan after T-Bird's wedding, I laid my hand on her stomach and Little T had kicked me.  I had no doubts, as did T-Bird, as to who that cry came from.  (For those who did not read my preceding posts, Little T was T-Bird's first child who was born prematurely and died soon after birth.)  When T-Bird left, she took Little T with her so she could terrorize her brother by hiding his pacifier and stealing his toys.  T-Bird however brought a spirit she didn't take with her.  T-Bird and Chay have different fathers.  Chay's father, Big D, was killed in an industrial accident when Chay was three years old.  After his death, they would smell his cologne in their house and he would visit Chay.  Chay is highly advanced and can see spirits as well as communicate with them but has learned how to block this out, for the most part.  Big D, who I never met while he was living, certainly took a shine to me.  After T-Bird moved, I had gotten out of the shower and was standing in my bedroom when I noticed an odd shadow from the corner of my eye and that oh-so-creepy feeling I was being watched.  When I would turn to look, the shadow would retreat.  This happened several times.  I knew who it was.  I  felt  who it was.  I told KC about this and she laughed and said, "Yeah, that sounds like him."  One particulary irritating day when I felt his presence as I stood with all my womanly delights showing, I threw on a robe and went into the living room.  I addressed him by name, thanked him for coming by and then said, "Okay, you've had your fun, NOW STOP LOOKING AT ME NAKED!!"  He left for a while but he's come back.  Now, when I feel  that   feeling, I just say his name in very warning tone and he takes off.  I know he is laughing behind my back.   Raunchy Spirits!!   What It Means To Me   I believe in an afterlife.  I believe that afterlife is based on your faith.  I believe in reincarnation and that animal spirits cross over as well.  My idea of heaven is not pearly gates and streets of gold.  My idea of heaven is a small cabin in the woods where the Autumn breeze blows, where I can run in fields of late Fall flowers and lay in crisp leaves and smell the never-ending Indian Summer.  I can pet and love any creature and naturally, I will have a lot of cats and my dog Ivy.   I know that every religion has their idea of heaven, nirvana, afterlife and in-between life.  Like I said, I'm not here to convince anyone of anything or prove anything.  Religion and beliefs are personal, as are heaven and hell.  I don't quite think it would be fair though for a Wiccan to have a Christian heaven, or vice versa.  Not that spirits can't visit each other but at the end of the day we are all entitled to our own nirvana.   I am also entitled to believe that all around me spirits swarm and guide and protect me in my daily life.  I believe that the spirit never dies and therefore, love never dies either.  I believe spirits have the capabilities to comfort us in our times of need, warn us in times of trouble and best of all, to love us unconditionally, forever.

						   Andrew David was born today at 3:54 p.m. weighing 7 lbs. 7 oz.   I forgot until this moment that J3 only weighed 7 lbs. 1 0z.  Perhaps a Freudian slip or psychic intuition that I mistakenly put 7.7?  Things like that happen around here.  More on that in my next post.

						   In the excitement of becoming an aunt again, I failed to mention that I'm going to be an aunt AGAIN!  This time its actually a non-familial birth but looked forward to none-the-less.  T-Bird's sister, Chay, and my sister-in-law were actually due the same day, August 4th.   Chay just called and said they are inducing her due to low amniotic fluid.  We know she's having a boy, so that's a nice balance.   Just for historical purposes... T-Bird and I hated the sight of one another when we first met.  This was due to the fact that T-Bird's aunt had lied about both of us to each other (What a drama queen!).  Anyway, once her aunt moved away and way lead to way, we ended up talking and found out what this bitch had done.  We've been friends ever since, sometimes the best of friends, sometimes we want to kill each other.  What are friends for?  As it happened, T-Bird and I found out about her aunt when I was three months pregnant with Hyper-Boy.  Over the next six months we forged a delightful friendship which included me calling on Saturday mornings as to inquire of her then-boyfriend, then-husband, now ex-husband, Boob, if my breakfast was ready.  Boob is a good cook.   T-Bird was visiting relatives in Detroit the weekend I went into labor and after a six hour trip home was met by Boob at the door announcing I was in labor.  She tossed her stuff and came to my rinky-dink trailer, trying in vain to convince me I really needed to go to the hospital.  I wandered and puttered and made her fix me toast with strawberry jam.  I told her that I just had to go to the bathroom one more time... and she yelled down the hallway, "Hey, when my mom thought she had to pee her water broke!"  Pwashhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!  I yelled back, "You bitch!"  She laughed and laughed.  I waddled out with a towel between my legs and agreed, yeah, maybe its time to go to the hospital.  On the way there, everytime I would have a contraction, amniotic fluid would gush and I would say, "Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew."  T-Bird would speed up.  LOL!!!   Anyway, T-Bird stayed with me for most of the time, in-between taking Boob to work and eating out of my sight.  She helped push my kneecaps to my earlobes and was standing beside of me as they placed Hyper-Boy in my arms the first time.  She moved to Michigan when HB was six weeks old.  I missed her, a lot.  She and Boob married in August 1997.  She was four months pregnant with their first child.  Little T was just a bonus to the festivities.  Unfortunately, Little T was born three days after their wedding and at a little over a pound, was too small to survive.  Even worse, because I had just been to Michigan to be in the wedding, I could not return to be there in person.  Little T was perfect in every way, she just got there too soon.  T-Bird had developed an infection around the amniotic sac, probably due to a small leak and the only way to save her was to deliver the baby.   In January 1999, T-Bird got pregnant again.  They decided to do a cerclage, which in layman's terms, is a great big staple used to keep the cervix closed until birth.  That meant, no sex.  Not only no sex, but no excitement either to prevent any chance of infection.  Then she developed gestational diabetes, then high blood pressure.  Until she was 34 weeks, everytime she called I asked what was wrong.  I had my bags backed, ready for the six hour trip to Michigan, whenever she called.   She called September 10th to tell me they were doing an amniocentesis (which means they stuck a long skinny needle into her uterus and withdrew amniotic fluid) to check the baby's lung development as they were preparing to induce her due to pre-eclampsia (a toxic condition characterised by seizures and high blood pressure.)  At 4:30 she called to tell me they were inducing, at 4:35, I left my office, swung by my house and left for Detroit.  My mom had HB.   It took me forever to get to the hospital, a lot longer than normal because some Einstein let T-Bird answer the phone under the influence of Stadol and she directed me away from the hospital (I was one mile away!!) and into downtown Detroit at 2 a.m.!!!  It took me even longer to figure out how to bypass Windsor Tunnel, which would have taken me to Canada!, and get back to the hospital.  Twenty minutes after I arrived the doctor came in and announced they were doing a C-section (no definition hopefully needed).  J3 made it in fine shape, 7 lbs. 7 oz. a full month early.  T-Bird was not so good.  Her blood pressure bottomed out and she spent two days in ICU.  She has no more babies planned for her future.  I've taken part in practically every major happening in their lives since 1996.  Birthdays, graduations, holidays, make-ups, weddings, break-ups, divorces, baby showers and a few police encounters, not to mention, some of the best food you'll ever eat.  So, here we are.  I'm aware of the striking differences and similarities between this birth and the birth of my niece.  First, my sister-in-law is 37 years old, Chay is 18.  It was my sister-in-law's third, this is Chay's first.  Married vs. unmarried.  Decent, hard-working father vs. ugly schmuck.  Girl vs. Boy.  Both induced, both due on the 4th.  Called by family vs. called by Chay (Anna, they have to induce, told you I would call, Mom and T-Bird will be in touch, come see me if you can!!)  I know if I'm not there five minutes after the birth, Chay will call and ask, "Why aren't you here yet?" vs.  "see my previous post."  Its hard to believe when I met Chay she was nine years old.  Now, she's having a baby.  Technically, since I'm 15 years older than she is, I'm old enough to be her mom.  Which means, technically, I'm old enough to be a grandma!!  Ughhhh... think I'll stick with being an aunt.

						   My mom called last night to tell me that they had gone north to see Annie.  She first described the three outfits she had bought for her in agonizing detail until I asked, "Mom, who does she look like?"  No one.  She just looks like Annie.  Okay, good start.  They have released Annie to come home but my sister-in-law is still in the hospital due to her blood pressure.  Which my parents didn't know so they had to add an hour to their trek to see Annie.  She said my brother hurt her feelings by griping that they hadn't called first to see where Annie was.   So, off they go.  When they got to the hospital, my sis-in-law's twin was there and her partner.  My mom was upset that SIL's twin didn't remember her name so she could introduce her to her "partner."  I add the inflection because that's how my mom said it.  My mom is not fond of gay people.  My nephews are running amok, to the point the nurse comes in and asks them to quiet down.  J2 was trying to force Annie to suck her thumb to the point my mom was afraid he would dislocate her arm.  Neither of his parents told him to stop.   My mother is afraid Annie will be just as rough as the boys, if she survives them.  I said, "that is not your problem mother.  C and J choose to allow their children to be that way.  And they will be the ones to pay and J1 and J2 have met their match.  Not only will she be as rough as they are, she will be twice as evil because she is female."   My mom finally said it was probably best that I hadn't gone.  What also stands out in my mind is that my mom and dad took a ton of food up there so they could fix lunch for the family.  If I'm not mistaken, they've done that when each of their children were born, but they didn't do it for me.  My mom yelled at me because I hadn't cleaned the house before I had Hyper-Boy.  That used to bother me but I watch how they trip over their own feet to win favor in my brother's house and keep getting slammed.  Its upsetting to me but then again, they keep doing it and they rarely, if ever, tell my brother how he has hurt their feelings or whatever.   I know they will make the trip north several times over the coming months.  I know they will not bother to make one trip to my house, instead my mom will whine to me that I don't visit enough.  I made sure when Hyper-Boy was a baby and a toddler that my parents saw him often, even if I was the only one doing the traveling.  I did it for Hyper-Boy.  My parents have their faults but they are good grandparents.  I know that eventually my mom will make a comment that I haven't been up in a while and this is when I will tell her that she hasn't eaten a meal in my home since December of 1999.  I will point out the fact that they have made numerous trips to my brother's home and have neglected to give me the same consideration.   That is a mean thing to do as I really don't care if they come or not.  They don't agree with the way I live my life or clean my house or because I smoke and that's their excuse as to why they don't visit.  I really have no problem in making my house presentable if they would like to visit, but presentable is not good enough.  It never will be for them, so I do what I'm comfortable with.   All that used to really, really bother me and made me feel less than important.  I let them do that to me but looking at the big picture I see once again how karmic law works.  If I could impress upon anyone how many tears I have cried and how many times I have questioned why I always fell to such disfavor when I tried so hard, you would appreciate the fact that I've let that go.  I will continue to facilitate a good relationship between my parents and my son because it makes me feel good for both parties.  I know it is what is best.   As long as my parents continue to be fair between the grandchildren, I will pick and choose the battles I fight with them over differential treatment between me and my brother.  I doubt there will be very many, if any.  I can stand up for myself without being cruel if the occasion calls for it, otherwise, I will bounce around in my own life and be glad in it.
