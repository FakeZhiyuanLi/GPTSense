      So today I went to work to get my check and schedule for next week, when I got there Lindsey gave me my check, and was like we don't have the schedule yet. Its Friday, I may have to work tomorrow, how am I gonna know? This is why you don't want a job till you turn 35 kids. Well I guess I'll go back later and see if they have it. If they don't, I'm not workin tomorrow.And thats that. As for now Im gonna go find interestingly creative ways to spend my $89.46 ( I know, its not much, but I only worked 18.6 hours.)

      It seems that all of my previous blogs have been deleted recently, so theres nothing here anymore. We cant have a blank page that would be an injustice for all of humanity. So here I am writing a blog just to take up space. Some time soon I will be posting My autobiography on here so check it out in a couple of days or maybe weeks (I've been busy lately) -The one, The only, ...Ryan...

      I woke up this morning at 6(as usual) to the sound of someone screaming(which is also normal)It was THURSDAY.so I took a shower, and went down stairs and grabbed a cup of Joe.(why is it called that? I have a cousin named Joe, so thats kind of sick.) but then I realized that it was 6:20. I dont have to do anything until 10. Why do I do this to myself?  I guess there is a good thing about being awake this early, I just havent figured out what it is yet. I've already been up too long to go back to bed, and I'm not awake enough to stay up.  Well today shouldn't be too bad. I only have an hour and like 15 minutes of school. That should take until...11:30-45 for me to get home. then I have the rest of the day up to 5 to do what ever I want.Which will most likely be talking online, and listening to music.  And then theres always good ol' work. Never a dull moment at work, except when no one is there.Oh well, I'm workin with stuart tonight so it shouldn't be too bad, although, I'd much rather work with Thomas(he's more fun)  That should be about enough for now...  Last time I checked, I was still ...Ryan...

      This week on Top Fizzle I'll be counting down the top Five songs I've been listening to lately. Lets get this show started, shall we?  #5. Vindicated- Dashboard Confessional. This is a great song off the Spiderman 2 Soundtrack. Dashboard has done it again, with its amazing vocals and beautiful instrumentals, this song is the epitome of Dashboard Confessional. I give this song a 9.2 of 10  #4. Memory- Sugarcult. This song is awesome because it applied to me at one time. Hes saying he likes someone but he knows it would never work. Yep it happens to the best of us. 9.4  #3.Last chance to lose your car keys- Brand New. If you haven't heard Brand New by now, you dont know what your missing out on. This is one emo band that knows how to represent. Ever been tricked by a girl? this is the song for you. 9.5  #2. Understanding in a car crash- Thursday. An awesome band, an awesome song. They play with such powerful emotion. I love 'em. enough said. 9.8  And here it is folks:  #1. Sic transit gloria... glory fades- Brand New. They've done it again, this song is flawless in my opinion. The lyrics are powerful, yet the melodic nature of the song is what keeps me coming back for more. 10 of 10. perfection.  Well thats all for this week, check back next time for the Top Fizzle CDs in my posetion.  Post a comment to let me know what you think we should count down in the future.  Opinions stated on this program are not that of this network or any of its affiliates.

      What is it about loud, annoying fireworks that everybody loves? Isn't it sad that the highlight of my 4th of July weekend is the day I get off from summer school, July 5th? There was one good part about the 4th and that was lightin 12 bottle rockets at once. The following are SOME of the things that sucked: WENT TO MY AUNTS TO SEE ROSS, HE WASNT THERE YET. IT WAS BORING. WE LEFT BEFORE HE GOT THERE. WE WERE GOING TO GO BACK, WE DIDN'T. WE WENT TO RON AND JULIES TO SWIM... I HAVE RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT SWIMMING IS NOT VERY FUN AFTER DOING IT FOR 18 STRAIGHT WEEKS. THEY HAVE SATELLITE TV... 999 CHANNELS, NOTHING ON. ONCE AGAIN, IT WAS BORING. SO EVENTUALLY WE LEFT. WE WENT TO WORK TO GET MY SCHEDULE... THEY FORGOT TO PUT ME ON THERE. WHEN I GOT HOME THE ANNOYING FIREWORKS HAD ALREADY STARTED  So I decided to go to sleep. I put in my new Thursday CD and was out before Understanding In A Car Crash came on.(thats about 33 seconds into the CD)  SO here I am on what will probably be the highlight of my 4th of July weekend. And thats all I've got.  Out like the fat kid in dodge ball, ...Ryan...

      &nbsp; Good evening and tonight. It's been a long while since I have had the time to update my blog, and I'm sure it wont be worth the wait, nevertheless... I dont really know where I was going with that one I just like that word. As most of you know I've been in Florida for a week now and I have had a great time. The old people place is kindof a snoozer but other than that its all been pretty fun.&nbsp; Im still in FL right now. I'm at my grandmas for tonight and we're going back to Tally tomorrow. When I get home I'll post my pictures from Downtown Naples, the beach and the everglades.Unfortunately the ones from down town didnt turn out so good. Now I feel bad for Joe, because he has cancer and he only has a month to live. Well thats all for now but check back in a couple of days for my trip journal and pictures. and someday I swear i'll post my incredibly short autobiography like i promised a while back. An example of what 15 hours in a car with patrick will do to you, ...Ryan...

      Quotes from the greatest movie ever made:   urlLink Van Wilder : Are you stalking me? Because that would be super.    urlLink Van Wilder : But you know what I've learned in my seven years here at Coolidge... Timmy? I've learned that you can't treat every situation as a life-and-death matter because you'll die a lot of times. Write that down.   urlLink Suicidal Freshman : I don't have a pen.   urlLink Van Wilder : Well remember that then. And you know something, Timmy? I think you've got the balls to make it here. Call me nuts, but I believe in you.    urlLink Van Wilder : Worrying is like a rocking chair. It gives you something to do, but it doesn't get you anywhere. Write that down.    urlLink Van Wilder : Don't be a fool, wrap your tool.    urlLink Van Wilder : What is wrong with people today?   urlLink Hutch : [taking a hit from a bong] It's the internet dude, fries their brain cells.    urlLink Vance Wilder, Sr. : Van is still in school?  Assistant: For the better part of a decade.    urlLink Vance Wilder, Sr. : Sweet Joesph, my son's a fairy.    urlLink Van Wilder : I know Ms. Pac-Man is special. She's fun. She's cute. She swallows.    urlLink Van Wilder : You shouldn't take life to seriously. You'll never get out alive.    urlLink Van Wilder : Richard, you rascal, you never told me you were a DIK! [under his breath]   urlLink Van Wilder : Not that you had to.    urlLink Van Wilder : Wow, If he's here, who's running hell?    urlLink Van Wilder : Well just take a look at this... ya... doodles... I attend class today just about stayed the whole time too!   urlLink Gwen : I'm glad you went to all your classes today.   urlLink Van Wilder : And a few that weren't mine, I stepped in the wrong room, liked what I heard... stayed.    urlLink Gwen : I'm doing a human interest piece... on you.   urlLink Van Wilder : I'm flattered, I'd love for your piece to be on me. [looks up at the ceiling and sighs]  urlLink Van Wilder : ... But sadly I don't do interviews, never have, never will. Do lunch though.    urlLink Richard : Mr. Wilder here is quite the collegian. He's in his, what? sixth year?   urlLink Van Wilder : Actually, its lucky number seven.    urlLink Gwen : Well I think it takes a lot more then the kind of underwear one wears to define them as a person. [Van looks shocked]   urlLink Van Wilder : Like what?    urlLink Van Wilder : It's a date.   urlLink Gwen : It's an interview.   urlLink Van Wilder : Gwen, first dates are interviews    urlLink Taj : Doesn't she have a boyfriend?   urlLink Van Wilder : Details. Only details    urlLink Van Wilder : We'll be accepting donations in the form of cash, visa, and full frontal nudity.&nbsp;  &nbsp; urlLink Gwen :I&nbsp; shouldn't even be talking to you like this.  urlLink Van Wilder : AND I SHOULDN'T BE IN THE WOMENS LOCKER ROOM!  there are so many more, but my fingers are tired.&nbsp;

      Didnt really do all that much today. Played some video games with Dj and Pat. watched "The Butterfly Effect". Freakin awesome movie btw. and then we just hung around. Stacey wasnt actually that "difficult" today. She bought pizza for all 3 of us and then watched "Van Wilder" with us, yet another awesome movie. "write that down." &nbsp; Later on I downloaded a bunch-o-new music. Got some Sugarcult, a little Fall Out Boy, and some Blink. I was inspired by Van Wilder and got a few songs from that movie, like "bouncing off the walls" and "stuck in america" by sugarcult and thats all i've done all day.

      Were on the freakin road again. Im so tired of this car by now. we only have a three hour drive though. tomorrow we go to Chris' for three days, that should be fun. Back to the present. This is almost as bad of a ride as the first. There is absolutely no room in this car. Im going to sleep. &nbsp; We got to grandmas before lunch, yawn, and theres about as much to do here as there is in the car. but later we might get to drive the golfcart. &nbsp; We went to the pool. kinda boring. Rick was checkin out all the minors, kinda funny. no one was &nbsp;hot. except these 2 girls, completely out of my league tho so i left them alon. Someone did, however, think Patrick was "cute". lol. &nbsp; Yeah we got to drive the golfcart, but not for too long. I cant wait till tomorrow. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Got home last night from work at about 11, went upstairs, messed with the compy for a while, went to sleep for what seemed like five minutes, it was actually five hours or so. Got up, went downstairs and loaded the car. Dad tried to whip me with a towel. I ran to the car hopped in and fell asleep for about 8 hours off and on. I finally woke up at 1 and we were a short way from Georgia. The longest freakin state i've ever been through.  &nbsp; We have stopped in a couple of small towns for gas and at a couple of rest stops. I tossed my contacts out the window somewhere in hicksville kentucky. Got breakfast at McDonalds(omg) in the middle of nowhere(Tennessee) &nbsp; I think I might have already gone insane if it werent for my precious cd player. pretty much been listening to thursday "full collapse" and brand new "your favorite weapon". there is absolutely nothing to do. All my games have been beaten multiple times, all of my cds past their prime. I cant even read a book, I tossed my contacts out the window. &nbsp; &nbsp; 7pm &nbsp; Were almost in Tally which is our first destination of three on our trip. We got delayed by construction for two hours. my mom said we lost 2 houors while I was asleep, well I want them back. This place shouldnt be too bad. tons of video games. 6 cats to torture, not gonna find a dull moment here. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
