        Um... today was rather boring nothing really exciting happened(Snooz Day). So I really don't have anything to write about the only thing that comes to mind is that in less then two weeks and that blows big time. It'll be good to see my friends again but I don't want to do all the homework (not that i'll do it anyways mind ya lol). Oh I figured something out, I really really want a tatto but my mom won't let me and my dad will agree with what ever she says wich sucks because I really really want one (have a mentioned that I really really want a tattoo if i didn't I do!). I don't know what I would get but Id get one on the back of my shoulder I just hope it dosen't hurt to much if I decied to get one, cause it wouldn't be cool if I only got half of it done. I could alawys do the other part in marker or something that wouldn't wear out to quickly if it ever happened. Oh well I'll have to wait till i'm 18 to see if I'll ever get if I don't chicken out first (which I know won't happen I hope lol). Well write to you later,                                                                                Sarah          P.S. Keep your ears open for I band called the Acidic Burn. Their a Bristish band and really awsome I hear, their goin to rock your world lol. :)           Bye for now!!

         Hey to who ever reads this,            Just got back from camping we went to the Falls and it was pretty cool. It was busy but fun. We went to Marineland for a day, I got to touch the whales and stuff and I went on the new ride Sky Screamer wich was a blast (but it could have been faster lol). Then we went to some bird place and I got to fed a bunch of birds. It was awsome they flew all over you and landed on you head it was cool (it was a good thing that I didn't get shit on). We saw the firworks and stuff (which was pretty boring excpet at the end because we got to leave). I saw a preview for a new movie called 'the Excorsist the beggining' (sorry if a spelt it wrong) and it comes out on august 20 and it looks really cool. but hey previews usually always look better then the movie anyways so I'll just have to wait and see if its any good or not. Well I g2g and take my dog out so I'll write soon if Im not busy. Buh Bye.
