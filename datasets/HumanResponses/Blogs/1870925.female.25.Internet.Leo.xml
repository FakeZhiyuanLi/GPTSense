          so last week there was a big email feud about james gray being gay or straight.......then it stemmed into him and his roomy being lovers......and now the roomy is bombarded with porn spam email................how convenient.........all this of course while using work computers...............whatever would we do without the net and messenger at "my place of work".........would we all quit or would we all get better at our jobs......lol.........in my case  im sure it would be all about the messenger....im the messenger queen....i guess that  why my dead air is always an issue........ but yes lets have a discussion about work now........and the messenger craze......ummmmmmmm nm i changed my mind ... lets never talk about work here ........ back to james and his faggy or nonfaggyness............what do you think..........if you havent been introduced to the work metro-sexual it pretty well boils down to a guy that you would think was gay but they just dress well and do their hair all the time......and in james case he does those two plus he says little girly things like DAMN and has dinner parties....oh yeah lets not forget about the whole girly way he shops and drives...omg........ JAMES R U GAY?......LOL JUST JOKIN HUNNIE I DONT THINK YOU R AT ALL.......BUT ID LOVE TO SEE YOU AND DONALD KISS..........LOL.....NO IM SORRY ITS GREAT......they r the straightest ppl i've ever met......;)   why does everyone gotta pick on james hes a great guy weird sometimes but super nonetheless................but the emails and such were super funny though.....good job tony and cory.....KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK BOYS.......

          i started this blog like 3 months ago and this is the second time i've written in it...my bad........ i have a dilema when it comes to writing ... i think if i were meant to do this shit i would have been makin books by now.....blag blag blag......... so anyway ill give it a go anyways......... where to start.......how bout the idea of my boobs and my friends(wont mention any names) (jamie) (LOL) too on a certain cory's web page.......how rude.........lol mine apparently ate my keys and well the "friends" boobs looked like an ass.....oh my god....good cover though when cory gets all sly and makes the name of the pic this is not georgina........lol .... thanks cory........ i could tell ya about my weekend but ya might get jealous......j/k....friday i decide to have a party at my place (me jamie donald billy james tanya) like every friday and got trashed......whoop whoop......surprizingly enough we were pretty loud for 6 ppl......we were supposed to go to the gilly but that got postponed due to lack of TEAMWORK....work with me here guys....the gilly is good ... dont knock it till you get hit on by elec detchevery....lol........ so anyways we ended up at the george street tim hortons to pick another drinkin buddy....so you remember how many ppl there were at the party well we all crammed in the cab together....not to mention the fact that the cabby let us drink and smoke on the way to sydney...it was great....what kind of world would we live in if when you r gettting a cab from gb to syd (20 mins) they wouldnt let you keep getting right out of er....lol....what a horrible world that would be..... so yeah we ended up at the "crapi" i dont really mean that i love that bar its a fire hazard but at least ill die DRUNK!!!!!!!!!!! we did the usual ...... well usual to us anyways......i licked a certain friends nipples repeatedly........and it might have been a girl and it might not have been.......know where i did this..........by the bank machine.......head up shirt and everything.....MY LIFE IS VERY RACY INCASE YOU HAVENT NOTICED..............nothing really out of the ordinary happened accept that i guess but like i meantionned...thats normal for me................ you know i wish i could bring a camera on one of my drunken stoopers but d'ah well you'll have to come with me instead....this blog is really only to find out how many ppl i can cram into my apartment at once...so far 18 i think....it was jammed and sometimes quiet though weird hey....im thinkin the noise of the brain cell dying .....hmmm is that considered not quiet at that point....omg i have to quit smokin the green...what was i just going on about...anyways....LOL ohhh yeahhhhhhhh everyone who knows james gray will be interested to hear this lol........well i think its funny anyways......there was this guy outside the capri starting with james and my friend donald....lets just say neither one of my friends r that big.....like cant beat themselves out of a wet paper bag....lol love you guys.....well i kick their asses every day lol..............well me being super woman decided this guy aint startin with MY FRIENDS...sometimes i cant hold my temper.....so i grabbed him by the shift and strated to pull him away from my crowd of ppl and i ripped his shirt clean off his body...........lol......stupid fuckers friends started to come over and flip on him for being a dick and now to top things off he never got his frustration out by fighting because i ruined that on him and he cant get into the bar to boot......ha HA ha HA ha HA ha HA.........fucker he was...... then there wasa girl in the bar that spilled her drink on me ON PURPOSE....lol me booze girls being catty....they dont mix well at all.........so i shook up my beer and tried to spray her...lool....little biatch...;) .........and then there was saturday........... so yeah sat night i decide to take it easy and then there was "chicken" which led to beer and lots of it......i had a dd so we went to syd at 1:30 am and hit hermans....well to say the least i dont really like that bar but lately i can tolerate it.............it sucked.......but b4 i went to hermans we stopped at a gay dance and well i love gay ppl if you didnt already know that........then you dont know me very much if you dont....so yeah it was over and most of the lovely gay men were gone but i saw a few though......I LOVE GAY MEN THEY R GREAT...lol........ okies now we're done with the weekend drunken stooper...........lets get to the painting job me and the boys got into......first we painted a bathroom a "pretty" blue color............which by the way the next day donald decides to paint the bottom half of the walls a funky reddish wash color over the blue....like my bathroom except mine rocks..........LOL..........AND THEN A FEW DAYS LATER HE PAINTS THE DOOR RED...lol......wtf i bought these guys nice border and everything and he goes and does that lol......... then as we were painting my bedroom well i had to kick JAMES GRAY out of the room because we were painting the top of the walls white and the bottom  of the walls are royal blue........and he kept going past the tape and putting white paint on the blue paint...little fucker...lol but i loves him he's great....well nuff for now.............ill write more later........

      so i just finished deleting a blog that offended my best friend..........he blocked me from his messenger and even broke plans with me......so yeah im a big dumb jerk.............sometimes i do things not really thinking it through first............just to let everyone reading this know....if you have a web site or you're a blogger you should ask yr friends b4 you post something that involves them...............sometimes ppl overreact and sometimes its just enough to kill you....but you keep it going anyways....i decided my friendship with james is way too precious to let something like this to tear us apart.......i thought it would have made him laugh but instead he got mad...............i like to think i am funny all the time but sometimes hey im not..............ok so im not perfect and neither is he but he is one of the kindest ppl i have ever met...and for that im sorry james........take me off block please...............  just to let everone know....we r not sleeping together..........we r really close friends...or at least we were b4 i had a brain lapse..............  JAMES GRAY IS NOT GAY..............THANK YOU FOR READING AND STAY TUNED FOR MORE............

      when yr faced with a hard decision what options would you weigh out to make the final cut?........and what about the what ifs?......are they gonna be left in the wind to bother you for a while to come?........... over the past few days ive realized that no matter how much you depend on someone or how much you think you need someone you cannot compromize what yr feeling.........i made someone close to me make a very hard decision and i know that if the answer isnt the one im looking for then i might be out the best thing that has ever happened to me but i cant help but think that the way im feeling about things right now isnt gonna change and i dont wanna feel this way all the time...............when the "thing" happens ......... i feel that my feeling are more important then anything else around me no matter what and so are yours if ya think about it...........no matter how close a friend you have......yr the one gonna be paying in the end for what actions you have made..............i think the very essence of that is lost alot of times..........most ppl think well im here for the long run may as well compromise my feelings for theirs....well in some cases yeah by all means but if yr gonna be misserable about sommin everytime it comes up well yr ultimately gonna make them feel miserable too so how is that gonna be good for anyone?.................so yeah ultimately you are the one gonna pay because they are still gonna keep on what they are doing and its gonna make you think omg i told them how much this bothers me everytime it happens and they repeat theirselves....thats gotta make ya think how much they would compromise for you............and how much yr feeling in the end mean to them....... ask youself just a few quick questions ... say right now you are in the position to give sommin up for someone you love a friend,  boyfriend or whatever and you know either way yr gonna lose out on sommin..............how would you weight out yr options....thats a hard choice isnt it.......their are alot of factors to be thought of..............and most of all the what ifs..................they can be the killer for the most part.............i thought my answer was given and the decision of my hard choice to make was made but to my surprize it wasnt and im not sure how to get the decision or when it is gonna be made....all i know is that my feelings matter the most and in the long run all things happen for a reason so whats meant to be will be and whats not wont be...........................and that no matter what the decision i will understand for the simple fact that its not mine to make...............so i will respect the views of others and not compromise my own views in the process however just take it all in and hope for the best.............. ....im not one to push as to speak my views on ppl or make them make a decision on my part but when my "rest of my life feelings" are laid on the line and i think i cant handle sommin and its not like its gonna not be there cause the other person with whome i spend all my time with is gonna be doin sommin like every so often or whatever......that makes me feel insignifigant....well im not gonna stand there and have some other person in my life make me feel inferior to someone else or intimidated or jealous or like i said up above i think the best word to describe whats goin on with my feelings are they feel insignifigant to the present issue and well thats just not going over well and my decision has been made the hard decision is out there and it has to be made for better or for worse im goin with the what if's scenario and letin it ride....so you know who you are and i think this blog is pretty self explainitory.........im not gonna be made to share or made feel insignifigant...the decision is yours to make and i need one soon..................................my feeling are very precious im like a fragile butterfly.....lolloolollololool....no really though......im waiting..........:)

      so lets start off this blog with a holy fuck.......i worked all of 6 hours give or take a few mins and omg it sucked ass.................i have the worst job in the world....i feel like im so insignifigant there on so many levels........like i dont own knee pads so im stuck on the phones all the time while there's like 10 ppl roamin for like 12 agents........i have no pull in that place no more the only authority i have is with vto and i take that on a weekly basis not hourly or daily like most........lol......hurts on payday though.................but on a positive note im moving away hopefully by the summer with my man(whom i am cranky at most of the time but i loves him though) to london ontario (his choice).........but anywhere would suffice with me...................... can you imagine living in gb and working at the only place in the town where there is any money if ya go everyday (stream) for the rest of yr days till ya can retire....omg someone give me a 5mm to nib that in the bud b4 it becomes a reality.................really though i wouldn't recomend that to anyone ya can start off anywheres well not so much london but anywheres besides here if yr leary about moving so far then start off closer like halifax...round up a few friends or yr bf or gf and head over cause ya aint gettin any younger and the experience is enough in itself to intice ya to go.....or should be anyways........ i've lived in halifax and ontario and a breif stay in pei.......these are obvious choices only bc most ppl from here well they are the only places they have been, lived in or sought out to explore.........so i did all three the only other place would be maybe out west like calgary or some place like that...........id settle for the other side of ns before here anyday for sure....................... there is no room for improvement or stepping forward here.........its like when ya hear someone say oh i moved here from say toronto and ya have this urge to say are you a retard or is the ppl who refered you to this place yr enemies?.......................cause my god this is the last place anyone should be refered to.......................there's nothing here no good malls no place to get a decent romantic dinner no privacy factor no breathtaking views no good bars....well there are some but like 2 and thats not enough to keep yr interest in going even for occasions ppl are like well maybe ill see ya there and they think yeah right ill be home and in bed by the time ya think about cracking the first beer......................really why would anyone come here gb ns come on now smarten up........................ really though what would ya be missin out on or loosin out on if ya gave movin away a go....if ya suggest maybe mr or mrs right lives here dream on casue if they are well they are already taken or turned gay for lack of excitement .....................and who wants to be a fishermans woman or wife for that matter........oooooh my man works 3-6 mos of the year and the rest is spent layin around doin dick while you work yr round....mmm.... thats a man for ya.................been there done that.....no thanks........no offense but thats just not me to those of you who read this that are fisherman....im sure i wasnt yr type anyways................and not everyone has to think like me or change their views cause of sommin i write in my blog........im insignificant remember....no worries........... i have heard nothing but good things from ppl that move away even if only for 6 mos or a year they usually have sommin positive to say like i payed all my bills off or look at my new truck or car or look at my new lovely wife or so on and so forth so what do ya have to loose....what were ya gonna be doin for the next yr anyways?.......spend the first 6 mos saving up and the other 6 somewheres else soaking up the sun or sceenery for that matter .... if at the end of yr saving yr not ready well save some more or go on a sweet vacation if ya gat paid bi-weekly theres like 12 pays in 6 mos and if ya put away say at the least 50 a pay thats 600 right there that'll buy ya a ticket somewheres and all of us know someone that lives away and im sure they'll roof ya for a few months untill ya can get yr own place..............or find descent roomies up there to live with....everyone bunks together away to survive.....it might seem different at first but ya get used to it...if i did anyone can cause i love my privacy and doing what i want when i want ................ its well worth it to come home with half the bills ya left with cause really there is way more money to be made away..................and if ya dont have ppl to be spending it with right away like ya have here cause think about it why dont ya have money here cause the only thing to do here is go to the bars and a movie....well it costs at least 40-50 with cabs to go out drinkin......not to mention the $ ya spend on buying drinks for yr poor friends.......lol.......and well the movies is 35-40 depending if ya both want some popcorn and a drink..................asuming yr with someone of course.......................... and thats another thing that keeps alot of ppl here their signifigant other...umm yeah so YOU are the only one thats gonna matter in the long run...its cool to take them with you when you go for leaverage or support but thets what they are there for they are not supposed to hold you back from yr inhibitions or dreams or anything for that matter.......i did it once and now i dont even speak to that guy i thought he was the end all but well i turned out to be dead wrong..........and i missed out on a huge experience that could have been very good for me....no regrest though right....well sometimes ya have to wonder though...............what if.....that is such a powerful question so amall but so signifigant.............what if i wouldnt have said that yesterday or wore that on the wekend?...............would i have been more noticed or prevented that person from having that point of view of me or that first impression of me?....................so many what if's are created ni the run of a day that im sure ya couldnt think of them all or write them down daily...it would take so long..........................and creat so many more casue what if i hadnt took the time to do that what would i have been doing..........ya get the picture................ im not very worldly but i know a few ppl that did the whole yr in korea or china or wherever to be an english teacher there for the work experience and they thought for sure they were gonna die or be so homesick....but a year goes by sooooo quick feels like just yesterday i was walking into an over 18 section of anything and im 24 now.................................what an experience to live in korea the culture shock might be crazy and overwhelming at first but just like everything you get over it in time.......................... so i guess what this blog boils down to is.....................if a friend offers to or brings up the idea of moving away dont think omg thats such a scary thought and i would miss everyone.......embrace the thought and think how long ago does 6 months feel to you ........what were you doing 6 mos ago and didnt it feel like just yesterday you were doing it................and if ya werent here for those mos what would ya have really missed out on.......................

      so appearently i was bad in a previous blog and i want to be very clear on sommin i believe firmly i freedom of speeh and sometimes it might hurt the odd few but thats the beauty of it .... speeh which is only words sometimes has the power to hurt sadden happify and or even sentimentaly hit someone right in the ear.....so i think that this blog is a wonderful thing for me and u to read for yrs to come and the odd tiome i will have a nasty comment about me but at least i made them care about sommin cause what else is there in glace bay to give one sweet fuck about ....... at least im makin ya use yr brain hey?..................... i might not be politically right in all my views but who the fuck is these days?................politics gets ppl killed really though who the fuck elected george bush really think about it why are we fighting ... for land ... the sivilians......or george's longing to get in battle or wait wait wait watch the battle from a bunker in the states somewhere a  million of miles away from the fighhtinmg in his silk pj's sippin on some gin and juice i know it has to be gin cause look at the guy he needs all the panty remover help he can get...........or maybe boxer remover in some cases depending on how "frisky" he is feeling that day.............. all this talk is commin from that bowling for columbine moie ... if you never seen it well its one of those must see movies you go into the movie store see a fat guy holding up a ball and the title bowling for columbine and yr gonna walk right past it...theres not very many movies lately that i would even consider refering someone to rent but really though that movie moved me in so many ways like up above for instance...what am i doing writing about george bush really though that movie made me care about sommin enuff to take the time to type (and i type slow) about.....rent it you'll thank me.......... so yeah back to freedom of speech and being "bad" ..... for that i am deply appologetic and maybe i might not name names cause that person wishes to remain nameless but i do want you to know i am sorry and that your name will never be mentionned again in that matter........................................ so on to some juicy funny stuff.................i have some things to consider here like for instance i have alot of things to tyope about my boyfriend and he might not like it but ill giver a go and see what he thinks if he dont like it well ill apologize in another one lol.........so last night i decide i wanna be bad in bed and i start to tie him to the bed and "try" to get him to talk dirty to me and tell me what he wants me to do to him and he starts to turn red but slowly but surely gets into it and i then do as he asks and its so erotic ... i know it sems to you omg id never do that or that you wouldnt feel comfortable..............well lets talk about some options here .....lets start with the comfort level of the relationship yr in right now and if its sturdy enuff to hold some comfort on its back......1: do you feel you could do or try anything in bed with them or are you so embarrassed that you wouldnt even bring it up.....ill tell you about my experiences with the opposite sex....in any other relationship i was in i would have to say no to that last question......you have to be comfortable enuff in a monogomus commitment ... really though if ya dont have that yr screwed and it wont come in time if yr already invested lets say 3-9 months into it cause your never gonna be if ya passed that milestone ya have to want to please each other and i think alot of it relys on how much you feel for the person and where you want to go with it..............i never felt so comfortable as i do right now in a relationship and i must say its a whole different world here like i feel like its not just me involved its both of us and thats enough incentive to get down to the nitty gritty.............and by nity gritty i mean holy bed experiences batman........lol......i swant you all to know that no matter what kind of relationship yr in right now you have to ask yourself one questionn to solve all the mistories of yr twin world......do i want to be here where i am right now in say 10 yrs looking at the same peron casue no matter how much fun you think yr havin right now its gonna be hard to get outta sommin that you've invested 3 yrs in and by then yr gonna be outta the dating loop and have to get over that loss as well ............ which could take months...........dont waste yr time...........its way too precious to play with...............get out and look for mr. right cause if i think i found mine then you must have some hope cause i thought there was no such thing as comfort genuine feelings on both part or even hope for bedtime "stories" to get better at one point and now im wishing i met him long ago..............weigh the advantages and dissadvantages.....go on go ahead..........if you had more then 3 major dissadvantages and i dont mean that he snores ant night or burps all the time cause those are trivial......but real dissadvantages well its time to move on cause the game of baseball put it right 3 STRIKES AND YR OUT everyone should play by that rule in all situations especially in a dating game.......................

      ok so friday night i went to the gillwood with a few friends and i had the pleasure of talking to someone whom i thought a few weeks ago had ran past me to avoid eye contact and turns out that he accually waved to me thank god cause i thougt he hated me for the longest time cause of his new woman so that made my night well not really made my night but made it a bit better to know that one less person that i thought hated me doesnt........... so onto the night i had a few drinks at my place with some of my closest friends and after a bit of laughing and burping we all headed to the gilly and "to my surprise" there was an overabundance of 16 yr olds there making me feel old but hey that comes with the territory when yr almost a 1/4 of a century (ugh)............but had some fun anyways ............ never dansed though......which felt weird but i also went to the bar in jeans and a sweater (wtf)............ so it wasnt a dansing night to say the least.............the night drug on and my boyfriend got really drunk and we ended up leavin not for that reason but just cause it wasnt as fun as it usually is so we got home and after a bit of "relationship talkin" we got on the topic of bashin heads off my cofee table and chris decided he wants to have a headache and bangs his nutty head off the glass a few times and as i reach to pull him away he realizes there's fish (fake ones) floating in my chineese bubble tank and he says "i want to swim with the fishes" i decide that my tub isnt gonna get filled tonight witht he fish from that tube with him in it playin with plastic fish so i take the top off the tube and stick his hand in it lettin him feel the water and take a fish out to play with to give him the sensation of "swimmin with the fish" so he starts to talk to the fish and i get a bit scared so i tell him to put the fish back so he proceeds to the tank with the fish in his hand the whole while talkin to it like its his best friend and he drops it in telling it ill see you tomorrow little fish have a good night.................so yeah that was my adventure friday night ............................ how long can u hold yr breath while yr man talks to a fish pretending its ok as you walk him to bed without laughing yr ass off so yr man dont feel like a nut?.........hmm think about that question really hard and then ask yourself how blue do ya think my face got before i fell asleep?....................

      Once upon a time, in a far away land, their lived an extremly famous porn star, by the name of Mr. T.  They called him T-bag for short, or should I say long.   He had the biggest, hairiest, smelliest balls in all the land.  Everyone loved to lick em, bite em, and suck em all the time.  He was the happiest man in all of the land.  But one day this had all changed.  There was a new cat in town.  They called him Dr. Dre, and he had the most enourmous, gigantic, humungous cack that had ever been seen before.  All the ladies (and some of the guys too) came from miles to catch a glimpse of this massive thing.  T- Bag was furious, he snapped.  He was no longer the happiest man in the land.  Then one day as T-bag was fed up with life, he seen an ad on the pornonet, that there was going to be a porn competition, and all the stars were going to be there, so T-bag was going to get his ladies back (and some guys too).  It was to be held under the umbrella tree and it was called  "Under the HumpBrella Tree".  As the weeks went by and everyone was more and more excited about the porn competition.  By this time all the ladies forgot about T-bag.  T- bag had a whole week to prepare for this big event.  So the curtains went down and the towns champ (Dr Dre.) comes up on stage and lifts the curtains throught the roof with his massive meat hook, the girls are screaming and screaming and going retarded.  Then the runner up came on, T-bag, he got up on stage and he got a few cheers but that's about it.  Then the  two competitors got up on stage and they started the match.  They each had to see who could shoot the biggest load and the longest distance on it. THe winner got a town full of blowjobs and the looser had to watch with his hands tied behind his back and had to leave the town forever afterwards.  The two stars agreed on the rules and shook on it. And the games were to start.  Being the champ, Dre picked heads on the coin toss and won.  So T-bag had to go first.  Excited  since he was going to impress the panties off all the ladies.  He stopped for a moment, the crowd went wild, and he slowly hauled out his big pink bag and started swinging it as he was doin it he was getting a blowjob at the same time.  The crowd was pretty impressed.  After about an hour and a half, he shot off this huge load that covered the first 18 rows and got 87 feet in distance.  The crowd was wild at that point. Then Dr dre came up and hauled out his big pecker and shot off a load in the air and it just came short of the 76th row. T-bag was happy and he got all his bitches back. And he felt sorry for dr dre so he got all the guys to come up and give him a blow job, while he was blindfolded.  And they all lived happily ever after.  The end.

      Hey bubbies......I got a little story for ya.......Here goes............   Once upon a time there was 850 little pigs.  These were nice little piggies that love to play in their own poop.  One day the big old mean piggy named Bernie told all the happy little piggies that they weren't allowed to play in poop any more that had to play in his.  All the little piggies were all upset cause they only liked to play in their own poop with their little piggie kiddies.  Then the big bad bernie piggie said that if they all didn't play in his poopie then they weren't allowed to play in their own any more.  So mean old bernie made up lots of lies and told the little piggies all kinds of stuff to make them believe they were never going to play in their own poop again.  So one day , a little sneaky piggie found out that big old mean bernie was just telling us those lies so all the little piggies would play in his poop instead of theirs.  So the piggies just had to play in big bad bernies just for a few days and then they could play in there own for a long long time.   The moral of the story is:  Don't play in someone else's poop when you can roll around in your own.  And never trust a big bad piggie.  my boyfriend is whacked............

      so i had to go to work last night cause "stream" was in a pinch and needed ppl to take calls and i had to go in for a 7 hour shift with only 1-15 minute break...how fair is that when supervisors can smoke and play as much as they want (in their own poop...refer to chris and his revised 3 little pigs blog...lol...)whenever they want....as well as some of the team members (well the ones giving the supervisors head on the side that is).....so i settle down in my seat not knowing what to expect and i hear *ding* in my ear and without any short training, keep in mind i havent taken a call since may 28th...they dont care if i remember anything or want to tell me if anything is different, just take a headset and have-at-er....and who said stream wasnt the "best place in the world to work for".........a few calls later chris shows up and says hows the phones he's on his super (in training) so since i only got a 15 min break i call down to intraday and ask if i could take a 1/2 hour super and they firmly say NO...we werent even busy they were just dirty like that....so i put my phone in release sign off for the night...go to my supervisor....and sign a resignation sheet.....a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders...what a releif to be away from the most stressful thing i have ever had to face in my life...and talk about favoritism and unfairness..it tops those attributes in a flash......not to mention my beivment days were dished out so that one of them landed on my short shift day...sunday(4 hours)...dont worry i have it all planned out in my mind what to say to unemployment and the labor board....im not staying quiet for this one.....i wouldnt wish that place on my worst enemy....well maybe....lol....

      so my day starts off pretty normal except for the slight headache i have from drinkin he night b4 and i start to do the usual things eating and bringing my neice and nefew their grading day presents(amber karaokee machine and tyler nintendo 64 controller and game and a plant) and my day goes on and as the night gets closer we start to head off to the grad party and i forget my smokes at home so we swing back and we see a car driving the opposite way from us and hands waving us back and we go back to our driveway and its my friends james gray, sean luker, shawn(groom to be)simms and some guy with a digital camera...and they proceed to tell me its for a scavanger hunt and they need 3 pictures from me...bra shot, nude tit shot, and a camel toe shot.....omg...noone besides the camera guy can make the camera work so he has to take the first pic of me then chris gets the hang of it and he takes the other two...i didnt want everyone in the room with me so they waited patiently in the living room.....dont know why it mattered to me cause im sure once they got in the car they were lookin at them sayin...."god bless georgina"....lol....so i was out last night to a grad party where there was free liquor floating all over the place and there was some good company so we drank lots and had a great time all around.....then off to the main event with chris...omg he went....lol....and we only stay long enuff to see shawn in his very drunk state and i had a few danses with him and congradulated him on his wedding with megan to take place soon.....then...i see my supervisor and as usual he says "georgina reid" then says who died....refering to my breivement for work.....and at first i think its crewl but hey someone has to know if i need to get paid for the 2 days that stream gives ya to greive.....to me you should get off what ya need, to some extent, cause what if it were my daughter or son or mom or dad.....just because i never "seen my granmother in 4 yrs"...(

      so my day starts off with me rolling over and givin the man a smoochie and getting on the ball to go to my nan's wake and chris as usual stays in bed as i rummage around to get stuff ready and such.....so i decide to call my mom to see if shes ok and to my surprize she's in bed and not going....well i wouldnt have it...so we get our showers and go to pick her up...we get to the first wake and we're late so my mother decides she doesnt wanna go in so we take her back to my place to talk and chill for a bit to get her mind off the goins on....meanwhile im in agony not knowing exactly what to say to make the situation any better so she keeps herself occupied with solitare on the commputer and mending the hem in her pants but the time is drawing nearer and nearer to when she has to face the funeral home...I, on the other hand, want nothing to do with going in and seeing "my grandmother" btw it looks nothing like her i took a short visit in to see her while my mom waited in he car and i never even recognized her....so we drop my mom off and she stars her jorney without me and my sister takes over the grieving process wih my mother....its so hard to grasp the thought that someday i am going to have to go through the same thing my mom is but only with different names on the obituaries...i do not want to go b4 my mom just for the simple fact that it would crush my mom's very being to go b4 her children but on the otherhand i dont want to look at my mom and think the same thing i thought when i seen my grandmother there lying lifelessly...that doesnt look like my mom there cold and bloodless....god pray i dont have too much to regret when my mom passes...i vow to spend more time with my father and mother knowing well that every second wasted is time i will regret....make what you will of this but remember regret is a harsh reality...do something b4 its too late.....

      ..........my nan died last night..... i got a call yesterday telling me these horrible words "nan has 1 hour to live"...of course doctors have been known to be wrong in the past but this one felt like it was real.....so then i call Chris and he already knows the news cause my sister had called the cell phone to tell me and i wasnt with him so he quickly got a shower and picked me up within 10 mins to take me in and console me......i wasnt close to my grandmother the last time i seen her was like 4 yrs ago bringing her favorite thing, diet coke and to say hi....looking back now i wish i had stayed longer to talk about some more things but you cannot regret the past only look towards things you can change now....so i reach the home and get on the elevator not knowing what to expect only my sister telling me "she looks nothing like nan"....and there is my mom and 2 aunts 1 cousin my sister and my aunt in law(missing 2 daughters whom passed before her, 2 daughters living away, a son and countless grandchildren and greatgrandchildren)....needless to say it felt cold and sad in that room knowing everyone in the room knew what was to come very soon...so my mother softly says come over here and tell her you love her and i slowly reach the bedside...and shokingly to me i dont recognize her there gasping for air mouth wide open eyes just gazing at the ceiling not focusing on anything or even blinking...at this point there was no swallow refexes...i never seen anything like this before only on tv i have been to many wakes and funerals with loved ones but none that i seen taking their last few breaths...i felt sad and i start to uncontrolably cry because it is very overwhelming to me to be there at this time in my nan's life stages...with life you are only guaranteed one thing...to die at some point...some sooner then others but inevitably this is fate...i feel like i havent done anything in my lifetime to die say for instance tomorrow so i have promised myself to see through what i have dreamt of for a long time...to go to school to be an auto mechanic to have at least 2 children by the age of 35 and to live very comfortably with a loving father and husband...these are not outrageous dreams ones that i can accomplish and for my nan i am going to do so...i feel like i have alot to live for and am going to live on vicariousily taking what my nan may or may not have done and make my dreams come true...you will be sadly missed but not forgotten nan...please watch out for me and do not be too dissapointed if i get out of line or do something stupid....I LOVE YOU...and am deeply sorry for not letting you know that everyday since the day i could talk...

      this is a comment from "annonomous" that i want people to read and think about what they are saying behind YOUR back....if you get outta line with my old sup this is what happens.....you think its so easy for me and or others to go over a supers head when you have people like this standing in your way...you just made it loud and clear what happens when you speak your mind about stream so people in that building who have to be there are gonna keep their mouths shut for this reason....you have to put up with bullshit in that building so if im bullshitting why are you proving me right?..... here's the comment that so easily could be you if you say anything negative about your own super or anyone that is.......this is exactly why it wasnt easy for me to go over my super's head....none of which i am ashamed of but the person writing it must have been so proud when they got their chuckles from people as they were typing....i wonder if anyone on their team agrees with me about this annonomous "team leader".....if anyone should be ashamed of anything it shouldnt be me...this is&nbsp;real folks im sticking my neck out for the noose to make people aware of that buildings capablities of "ruingin/slandering" your name if you talk out of sync..... time after time i get basheed for things that happened....you're gonna start spreading rumors....rumors are rumors hunnie.....ive got enuff friends now and plenty of room for more...but you have&nbsp;friends just like you GOSSIPERS and in the long run....you are gonna be the butt of someones joke/slandering/bashing someday...what goes around comes around.....deal with it like would anything else start rumors about the other person that is threatening you...its a visous cfycle but im sure if you can dish it you can take it RIGHT?........ their comment..... "So readers, who believe this trouble making byatch! I hope you see that she is the one with the issue’s and not the Sup. You should try and open up a Lemon Aid stand while you try to convince HRDC that you’ve been poorly treated and that’s why you quit. You Quit cause your too Facking lazy! Maybe you should sell crystal Light instead of lemon Aid, because if you haven’t noticed, you’re not all that anymore like you thought you were at one time. Can you spell Skank? So the next time you try and Bash one of my Friends, I think you better have yourself a factual case, and not all the bullshit that you’re trying to spread around! And by the Way I’m posting anonymously because I don’t have a Blog, and I don’t want to have one either. The only way that you can tell who you are is to create a Blog. And if you keep dishing the bullshit out, I will keep telling people more and more stories about you, ok little miss Innocent???"

      if you read my blog i am sticking up for people not saying names or saying there was anything great about my performance...ps the comment about chris knowing (there aint a goddam thing he doesnt know about me) and u going to spread nasty rumors about me...yr no better then anyone else i that building that is known for gossiping...im not gossiping here im just being a "template" for my own mind and thoughts....your whole comment is bashing me...why dont you ask how many people in that building accually likes the way my old sup handles situations and such....and as for the supers favorite comment...you may have enjoyed your idle code but how come you havent opened your mouth for the people you see in their seats that deserve idle just like yourself?.....selfishness and i appreciate your comment but read my blogs and see how many names are there... if you prejudged and hooked a name to my "certain someone" and the such....you think exactly what i do...cause i cant say names because i dont believe in humilliating people for fun or for game...im speaking my mind on my views not bashing so i can be the "cool" agent or friend thereof.....i feel there are alot of people that believe and agree with what im saying and someone has to speak for them....cause my old super just spoke for his friends and bashed and/or made fun of others.....joking/friendly to some...call it what you will&nbsp;my old super&nbsp;did say alot of nasty things about people in that building anyone that spends time with him would know that...i think its great that now&nbsp;my old sup&nbsp;knows he has at least one friend just like him that can come on here and bash someone for him....but like i said gossip is one thing and doing it to be cool the same...but when youre doing it to be the voice of someone else thats when it matter...people know the difference between gossip/bashing and opinions.....whether they are friends with me or him.....  &nbsp;  as for the comment from "his" friend....you're draggin people directly into the situation....and his girlfriend never put me in my place she was like well im his girlfriend but its an off and on situation...so basically its ok....I (me) told her to tell him i left with friends...so if thats putting me in my place well i guess yr right....and hands down to the comment about chris....hes great and you are gonna try something that he doesnt already know?.....he knew from the beginning because the guy was making it akward (my own doing) for me at work and im sure he would have noticed....no secrets here hunnie but if you wanna fling shit...you deal with yourself in the morning when you're known as the gossiper and thats all you'll be tagged with.....GOSSIP....thats great and all (for u) but is that what you want to be known for...or for speaking up for YOURSELF and letting people really know how you feel about things not just to prove your friendship?....  &nbsp;  if you pay close attention and all "friendships" aside...whos being bashed here me or the old sup?.....im simply stating real facts that affected me in that building and many others..... not seeking out to bash anyone or manipulate someone into reading this blog and making them hate someone....im stating things that happened to me and others.....unlike the comments that are clearly trying to make people hate me.....  &nbsp;  im no perfect person.... QUEEN OF IDLE...well that may be so but what would you do if you werent a sups favorite in q red orange green all the time and you were never off the phones for your "coffee, chatting time?".....call after call ding after ding...since your such a great sups pet ikm sure your handle time / performance / well goddamn it everything you do on the phones would have been just fantastic i bet......  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  NOONE IS A WINNER HERE...THIS IS NOT A GAME....SOMEONE IS NOT GOING TO GET THE LAST PICTURE IN OR LAST SAY IN....THESE ARE EVENTS THAT AFFECT PEOPLE'S FEELINGS AND IN NOT HERE TO MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH AT SOMEONE ELSES EXPENCE...IN NOT WRITING THIS BLOG TO MAKE FRIENDS IM WRITING IT TO BE HEARD......................  &nbsp;  noone is a winner here this is NOT&nbsp;a game......

They have a job to do to. As far as these people being in an idle code, they are there for a reason, because they are good at doing thier job, and they don't have a bad attitude about the place. They don't sit there and scream at customers...they are not rude to them.***  A SUPERVISORS JOB IS TO KEEP PEOPLE ON THE TEAM IN LINE AND BE EQUAL TO ALL INVOLVED...THEY HAVE A JOB TO DO...YES OF COURSE THEY DO BUT IN ANY CASE THEY NEED TO BE FAIR...THERE WERE ALOT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF ON THAT TEAM THAT WERE CAPABLE OF DOING THE "IDLE CODES" JOBS...THE SUPER JUST HAPPENED TO PICK ONE IN PARTICULAR ALL THE TIME...THERE WERE PEOPLE ON THE TEAM THAT WERE NEVER GIVEN A CHANCE .....MOST PEOPLE ON OUR TEAM WERE MORE THEN CAPABLE OF LISTENING SIDE-BY-SIDE TO ANYONE IN THAT BUILDING AND TELLING THEM DIFFERENT THINGS THEY COULD HAVE CHANGED IN THEIR TONE OF VOICE IN TROUBLESHOOTING AND IN THEIR HANDLE TIME...HOWEVER THERE WERE CERTAIN PEOPLE DOING IT ALL THE TIME...I MYSELF CHOSE TO SAY WHAT I DID ON THE PHONES AND WHAT I WOULD TELL ANOTHER PERSON TO SAY ON THE PHONES WOULD HAVE BEEN BY THE BOOK...NOT MY "PERSONAL TOUCH"..AND AS FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE IDLE CODES WELL THE PERSON OFF THE PHONES CHECKING THIER EMAIL IN IDLE...SHE HERSELF SAID IN ONE OF HER TRAINING CLASSES THAT SHE FELT THAT PEOPLE WERE OFF THE PHONES INJUST AND IT WASNT FAIRLY PICKED..I HAVE WITNESSES TO THAT ONE...DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT THE QUIET PEOPLE ON THE TEAM DONT THINK THE SAME WAY...HOW ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT CAME TO WORK ONTIME AND NEVER TOOK POINTS THAT WERE STUCK ON THE PHONES JUST BECAUSE THEY NEVER SUCKED THE SUPERS ASS TO GET OFF THE PHONES...HOW COME THEY WERE NEVER TALKED TO ABOUT IDLE?....WHY DID THOSE PEOPLE, JUST AS CAPABLE, HAVE TO TAKE THAT OTHER PERSONS CALLS IN Q?....HMMM WHY?...,.CAUSE THEY WERE BETTER AT THEIR JOB?....OR BECAUSE THEY NEVER SUCKED ASS..OR COULD IT BE BECAUSE THEY KNEW THE PERSON OFF THE PHONES ALL THE TIME WERE BETTER AT THEIR JOB THEN THEM?...I WONDER?...MAYBE CAUSE THE SUPER WASNT VERY APPROACHABLE?...IM SURE ALL THESE THINGS WERE A FACTOR IN WHAT WENT ON ON OUR TEAM....NOT JUST ME AND MY "ATTITUDE"...IM THE ONLY ONE THAT THINKS THIS WAY AND THINKS SOME NEGATIVE THINGS ABOUT THE TEAM AND THE WAy THINGS ARE HANDLED IN THAT BUILDING...I DONT THINK SO...AND AS A POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE VERY CLEAR IS THAT MY RUDENESS ON THE PHONES WAS ALMOST ALWAYS TAKEN AS A JOKE AND TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WERE FUNNY...SO "RUDE" OR MAKING PEOPLE ON THE TEAM LAUGH AND A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR FRUSTRATIONS TAKEN OUT THROUGH ME?...I WONDER....IM MORE CONTRIVERSIAL THEN THE NEXT CHICK I KNOW THIS...BUT TO ANYONE THAT ISNT MEAN TO ME OR IS FRIENDS WITH ME KNOWS THAT I WOULD BEND OVER BACKWARDS TO MAKE SOMEONE LAUGH OR MAKE THEIR DAY....IM NOT RUDE IM A PERSONABLE PERSON...   ***Every job has it's ups and downs, and there are always going to people that do a better job than you. You have to realize that if these people are better at thier job than you they are going to get "rewards". They worked hard for them and why shouldn't they enjoy it. They actually went to work, and stayed for thier full shift. Why should you be rewarded with being off the phone for nothing?***  OMG PEOPLE BETTER THEN ME/YOU AT THEIR JOBS....SIT BACK AND THINK OF ALL THE TIMES YOU/THEY SAT ON THE PHONES WHILE SOMEONE THAT JUST STARTED THERE LIKE 3 MONTHS AGO LISTENED TO ONE OF YOUR/OR YOUR NEXT STORE NEIGHBORS CALLS AND COACHED YOU/THEM ON THINGS THAT YOU ALREADY KNEW BECAUSE THEY WERE THEIR SUPERS PET?...HUH...AT LEAST ONCE HEY.....NOW IM TRYING MY BEST RIGHT NOW TO NOT MAKE THIS PERSONAL AND MENTIONNING "PEOPLE ON THE TEAM" RATHER THEN JUST MYSELF BECAUSE THATS HOW IT IS THE PICTURE IS BIGGER THEN ME AND U....YOU ARE TAKIN THIS AS A PERSONAL ATTACK ON ME WHEN YOU SHOULD REALLY TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT PEOPLE SITTING AT THEIR DESKS THAT DONT APPROACH THE SUPER AND ARE CLEARLY GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO AND THEY SIT THERE DAY AFTER DAY TAKING THE "IDLE PEOPLES" CALLS...THATS FAIR TO YOU IS IT?....THERE'S A BIG PICTURE HERE NOT JUST ME AND STREAM....AND MY "BIG" ATTITUDE....THERE WERE 2 PEOPLE ON OUR TEAM THAT WERE NEVER ON THE PHONES AND THEY DESERVED IT....EVEN THOUGH WHEN ONE OF THEM HAD TO GO BACK TO THE PHONES BECAUSE WE WERE SO DEEP IN Q, SHE LOST IT(DONT BE MAD AT ME HUNNIE WE ALL UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU ARE COMING FROM WE FACED IT EVERYDAY AND I DONT THINK ANYTHING LESS OF YOU FOR IT...ITS NATURAL TO LOOSE YOUR PATIENCE UNDER SO MUCH PRESSURE).....BUT IF WE LOOSE IT CAUSE WE DO IT EVERYDAY WE ARE CONSIDERED RUDE....   ***The remark about it just so happened to be the people that he interacted with outside of work that were off the phone.... no matter where you work, if you are there long enough, you will make friends with your co-workers..... being friends with these people, just like anyother people, you go out and do things with them. There have been many times that you have been seen "interacting" with a higher up.***  WHEN YOU SAY INTERACTING..IF YOU ARE REFERING TO SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR...WELL TO SUM IT UP PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES AND I AM NO FOOL TO THIS HOWEVER THIS ONE MISTAKE I MADE HAD A MAJOR INPACT ON MY STAY AT STREAM....TO GO OVER MY SUPERS HEAD WHEN/IF I NEEDED TO I HAD TO GO TO THIS PERSON WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT TO TALK TO SOMEONE THAT HAD SO MUCH DISRESPECT FOR ME OUTSIDE THE WORKPLACE...HOW WAS I TO THINK HE WAS TO BE ANY DIFFERENT OUTSIDE THEN HE WAS INSIDE?....AND IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT IM SURE SOMEONE WILL FILL YOU IN...CAUSE GOSSIP IS A MAJOR FACTOR IN MOST PEOPLES LIVES...IT KEEPS PEOPLE ON THEIR TOES TO EASEDROP....   ***During meetings, my teams supervisor would constantly say, "if you do not want to be here there are resignation sheets on my desk that you can sign",.... he was only stating the obvious..... if you didn't want to be there, then resign... don't be negative and try to make everybody around you negative.***  HMMM...IM GLAD YOU BROUGHT THIS ONE UP....MY SUPER DID CONSTANTLY SAY THIS TO EVERYONE ON THE TEAM...HOW ENCOURAGING IT WAS TO HEAR THAT EVERYDAY.....TO ME AND THE REST OF THE TEAM.........ENCOURAGMENT IS WHAT MAKES A TEAM WORK TOGETHER.....HMMMM HOW INTERESTING....  ***and they were nothing to my supervisor all he used to muster up to me was "how did you ever get him/her to say those things about YOu?".

      so i applied for unemployment yesterday and i had to say QUIT...therefore im thinking i have no choice but to appeal but i did say alot of things in the application defending my "honor" so-to-say.....there were alot of things going on in that building that ppl dont know about ... even personal stuff not just my personal stuff being flung around but for others as well.....i dont think im any more entitled to get unemployment then the next guy from stream but i really had no choice but to quit...it was either that or get fired.....i saved some of my application answers....no questions posted just my answers to random questions on the form...here goes.....   1:We all had pressure to leave work. During meetings, my teams supervisor would constantly say, "if you do not want to be here there are resignation sheets on my desk that you can sign", he also used to pinpoint people on the team and say "theres one there for you in particular" and i happened to be one of those people.   2:There was never a time where your extra efforts were recognized. I constantly got kudos calls (calls where the caller wanted to talk to a supervisor to "brag" about how well a job you had done) and they were nothing to my supervisor all he used to muster up to me was "how did you ever get him/her to say those things about YOu?". I think that in any situation where you have to be under a supervisor they should let you feel good about accomplishments no matter how large or small.   3:We had a sevourance package, ready willing and able to come back to work at anytime mind you, however, people including myself, were under the assumption there would be no work after this. That was supposed to run for 16 full weeks, however, we had to work though most of it. They served us with the papers to start may 1st 2004 to aug 12 2004. However, throughout those weeks we had to work fully on the phones and only get paid for hours worked not the full 40 hours promised on the sevourance, until may 28th then we would be off till aug 12. We all thought this would be ample time to look for a new job or relocate, however, the new schedule they came up with as follows dampens this idea. They came up with a training schedule which was very different then the hours we all worked previous and had to stick to the schedule even though i had a conflicting schedule with my drive they would not allow me nor anyone else to switch even though i had several people wanting to switch due to drives and the bus schedule didnt drive for either the start or end of the working times, the training was to be approx. 2 times weekly and it was based out of customer service which we spent 9/9 hours working because we were phone internet tech agents which guaranteed customer service for the full 9 hours. Then on june 21st they tell us the contract wants us back for a few weeks then we dont know whats going to happen. Since they gave us the sevourance package supposedly already, once the contract was finished you would be laid off. Therefore we all had nothing to fall back on only waiting 2 months give or take for unemployment. This sounds unfair to me.   4:I recently had a death in the family a week before i quit stream and had breivement days (3 to be exact) and only got paid for 2, which is pending. Solectron requires a death certificate for this which i delivered to them. My supervisor seen me outside work and asked, for work purposes, in a very unheartedly tone "who died, you want to get paid dont you?".   5:June 27th, the day before i quit work, i went to my doctor to get some time off and he denied me saying, "its summer that must be why you want it off". This is not the issue, at the time i had stress from my job, a death in the family that i couldnt get more time off for, and a supervisor that had just been unbearably rude to me as stated above.   6:We have "idle codes" at work which basically means you get to train or listen to peoples calls side-by-side to coach the person, and on our team we would have only certain people in idle which the supervisor picked. On many an occasion had i mentionned this to my supervisor that some people on our team would be in idle at their desks checking their emails or surfing the web (these people just happen to be the people my supervisor interacts with outside of work) and he allows this as the rest of the team takes calls that those people should have been taking as well. I believe that there wasnt one person more capable then the other to do idle on our team. However favoritism doesnt make for a very healthy and happy team. My supervisor would shrug me off and tell me to go back on the phones.    7:This is a very difficult question to answer. To sum it up i would have to say, there was no easy way to discuss this kind of situation with my supervisor. Anytime i would mention work conditions or lack of teamwork, i would get the same answer as always, "theres a resignation sheet on my desk if you dont want to be here."    8:At stream there were many lay-offs including GMs which were above my supervisor. There was no easy way to know exactly who to go to talk to for this. Besides i had an instance at work where my supervisor had called me "useless" in front of many co-workers. This was enough to make me want to go over his head right then and there and he pulled me aside and basically said im your boss my opinion doesnt matter so just do your job and shut up. How do you go over a supervisors head that says things like that to you? I found it hard to talk to him and thought it would be the same no matter who i talked to.   9:Well, again who do i talk to. This isnt something i am firmiliar with, i just want some help to relocate and find a new job. The lack of knowing when i was going to be laid off and or if there was work or not was strssing me out and i didnt have anyone to turn to. I thought the lay off and/or sevourance was going to be the perfect oportunity to start over and now look where it got me, begging to have a new start. I understand that maybe i should have went over my bosses head but as i stated before this was not easy for me or many on my team. I had asked many a times to be treated equally and got no response, the only thing i had in my power to do was quit.   10:The stress of the job itself was enough to make anyone crack. Relocating was what a transfer meant and i didnt have the money to relocate myself.   11:As i stated previous, the sevourance was going to be the perfect opportunity to look elsewhere with the time off and with the 40 hours a week pay "promise" i had many places in mind. But as i indicated this was all taken away from me and many others, as they made us come in for training which made it harder to travel to fond an apartment in maybe halifax of surrounding area, or maybe go back to school.   12:My last attempt to try and muster the courage to go back to work to see maybe a brighter future in the building was dampened by my seating arrangement. There was a guy on our team which was constantly scratching at his head and everyone on the team noticed this, even the supervisor and he was basically placed where he had to sit alone. When i came back to work my supervisor sat me beside him, because of an outside conflict i had had with one of the supervisors friends. I requested to move, because when i got there my keyboard was covered in dandruff from the other teammate using that same keyboard before we had left the building for the training. I spoke to my supervisor and he said "dont be silly, just sit there" i tried ot explain it to him and he, as usual, shrugged me off. So i talked to his per-say secretary (a girl on our team that he had do all his arrands and such) and had her come and look at the keyboard and she then talked to my supervisor and then she came and gave me permission to move. My supervisor was very much favorites based, and as i indicated throughout this application i clearly was not one of his.   AS YOU CAN SEE NONE OF THIS IS BULL-SHIT....ANYONE THAT KNOWS ME KNOWS ALL OF THESE EVENTS HAPPENED...THIS IS A REALITY FOLKS.....STREAM ISNT JUST A $620 PAY EVERY 2 WEEKS ITS A MIND TRAP...AND I JUST HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THE ONES THAT STICKS UP FOR THEMSELVES AND GOT THE FUCK OUTTA THERE.....
