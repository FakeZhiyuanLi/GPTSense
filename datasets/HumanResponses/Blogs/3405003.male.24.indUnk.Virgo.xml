						         Many of us are familiar with the Biblical passage "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."  ( Genesis 2:24 KJV ).  Are we not also familiar with the powerful meat-cutting utensil, the cleaver?  This raises the question, what is the definition of cleave?    The Bible verse uses cleave to portray a bringing-together.  Newer versions such as the NIV say "and be united to his wife."  Not only does it speak of bonding, but the connotation of the word is implied by having been used in conjunction with the (presumably) inseparable bond of marriage.  "What God has joined let no man put asunder!"    Doesn't cleave, by way of the cleaver, also support a strong connotation?  A cleaver is used to separate thick hunks of meat – even to power its way through bone!  Once, i was making a hamburger for myself.  i had a two-pound tube of frozen hamburger but only enough appetite for one-pound.  i considered my options for splitting the tube in twain, and quickly decided on the cleaver.  With one moderate swing, the cleaver popped the hamburger apart and sent the two halves flying five feet in opposite directions.  i was impressed!  its name is what it does, and it does it very well.    The meanings of these words are very clear; so, we must wonder – Can a word really be its own antonym?  As strange as it sounds, the answer is yes!  Look at these definitions of cleave from  Dictionary.com .      cleave1  (kl v) v. cleft, (kl ft) or cleaved or clove (kl v) cleft, or cleaved or clo•ven (kl  v n) cleav•ing, cleaves  v. tr.  1.	To split with or as if with a sharp instrument. See Synonyms at tear1.  2.	To make or accomplish by or as if by cutting: cleave a path through the ice.  3.	To pierce or penetrate: The wings cleaved the foggy air. 4.	Chemistry. To split (a complex molecule) into simpler molecules.    cleave2  (kl v) intr.v. cleaved, cleav•ing, cleaves  1.	To adhere, cling, or stick fast.  2.	To be faithful: cleave to one's principles.   To make things even more bizarre, "cleaver" is also an acceptable term for an adhesive.  Also in the case of both definitions, a cleaver can be any person performing the act of cleaving.  So, as an amateur cleaver, you might accidentally cleave your cutting board with your cleaver, but all you need is a cleaver with a good strong wood cleaver to cleave your cutting board back together.

						          We must not get drawn into the idea that animals have the same rights as humans.  As with all of God's creations, it is wrong to abuse them, but all that is in and on and around this world was given to us by God for our own use and enjoyment.  The idea that animals are akin to humans is ultimately rooted in the theory of evolution; however, many people’s beliefs are based on their own observations of animal behaviour.  Anyone who has had a pet knows that animals develop a "personality," but this is nothing more than learned behaviour.  Animals learn through positive and negative reinforcement that certain actions yield certain results, and more intelligent animals learn more easily and appear more "human."  A dog has  instinctual  urges to eat, play, even get pet, and it has learned behaviours that relieve these involuntary pressures.  What then, you may ask, is the difference between animals and humans?  The answer to that lies within the implications of my last statement.   Animals do not have desires.   Closely tied to this is my assertion that animals are not sentient; they are not self-aware.  Sentience is not a product of intelligence but of something much grander; for, it is not based in the natural but in the supernatural.   Sentience is a product of the spirit.     Many scientists, as you can imagine, do not agree with this.  That sentience is spiritual is a creationistic idea, only awkwardly fitting into evolutionism.  Microevolution, or adaptation, is happening all around us everyday.  Species are always changing to better exist in their environment.  This is a scientific fact.  Macroevolution, the origin of the species, is the idea that over inconceivably long periods of time these adaptations produced the many species that exist today, and this is what i do not believe.  While species are always changing, a cat is still a cat, a fish is still a fish, an eggplant is still an eggplant … you get the idea.    While i have scores of problems with evolutionism, most of these have been vigorously debated for decades and have lost much of their intellectual appeal.  My biggest problem; however, is this topic of sentience.  Even from a wholly non-creationistic viewpoint, i find it problematic.  Can sentience really evolve from nonsentient creatures?  if the answer is yes, then sentience must have simply been an adaptation, a means by which to more easily exist within the environment.  Can this be?  Macroevolution is based upon the principle of reduction of energy, or efficiency.  Ask yourself this question – is choice (or doubt) more efficient than instinct?

						         So, i just typed four paragraphs entitled "Sentience, Evolution & Animal Personification."  i accidentally hit enter after typing the title, and i lost everything.  i feel like crap.  i'm gonna go buy some ice cream and go home.  Enjoy your blogs while you have them, for you never know when they might be tragically lost.  -Catt

						         Okay.  i just wrote this in an email to a friend, so i thought i'd post it.  You know, to give you something to chew on.    Einstein's dream was to develop a "unified theory." A "theory of everything" that combined gravitation, electromagnetism, and the strong and week nuclear forces (the rest of physics and chemistry). A theory that spanned from astrophysics to quantum mechanics. Sometimes, i wonder if this "theory of everything" could really be discovered. i do believe it exists, but what if it combines fields that we never imagine could be related. What if we were to discover that black holes, tyrannism, jazz history, and pain killers could all be described, hence predicted, by the same principle? What i'm really asking is, what if this unified theory we seek is some sort of "Law of Creation." i know i'm personifying God here, but what if God used one simple basis at the beginning of creation and simply let (or directed) that basis develop into the complexities of the natural world that we observe today? Sometimes i see this unified theory as a sort of "face of God" thing, and it scares me.

						         Hi.  Um, i found my friend here, and i wanted to leave a comment, but i had to sign  up.  i'm not sure what this blog will be about, but i'll try to figure that out in the next few days.  Until Horace turns down a bowl of asparagus soup... Excelsior!

						         So, i recently started a temporary job for SC Johnson.  You know, "a family company."  Anyway, that's why i've been out for so long.    As i walk around doing all of my wonderful work, i walk through many doors.  Now, many years ago, walking through doors as a child, i thought to myself "i'm not going to push on that metal plate thing they put there, because everyone else touches that when they open the door, so that's were the most germs are."  i'm not sure why this concerned me because i've never really bothered avoiding germs.  i've eaten moldy food without care, i routinely eat food off any floor, and i'll finish anyone's drink.  But, i've digressed.  Again, i avoided the push-plates.  Now, sometime last week i was entering the mens restroom, as i've been known to do from time to time, and as always, i avoided the metal push-plate.  As i said before, germs don't bother me, so this practice continued purely out of habit.  But last week, as i entered the fifth floor mens restroom of building forty, i noticed the door - the part of the door directly around the push-plate.  Do you know what i saw?  i saw the warn and discoloured wood where everyone else was apparently also avoiding the metal plate.  So, i've changed my habits; i push the metal plate, now.  i was clearly not avoiding germs on the wood, and i'm still not on the metal, but again, the germs don't really bother me.  And of course, the plate is there for the very purpose of eliminating the wearing and discolouring of the wood.    So, the question is, "What damage are you doing simply because your actions are habitual?"  Really ask yourself, "What are the things i do  just because ."  Maybe you hit the bars every Friday night, because that's what you do Friday nights.  You drop a ton of money, get drunk, and spend at least half the day Saturday recovering.  You do damage to yourself and those close to you for some reason, which is probably long forgotten and very likely erroneous in the first place.    Maybe its something different for you, maybe you avoid church.  i've met so many people that don't go to church because they have a problem with the church people, like they expect church-goers to be something other than human.  The truth is, you can't avoid the germs, but you can work to preserve rather than destroy.  But, to really understand my analogy, you must realize that  church  is not that protecting plate, God is.  Plenty of church-goers routinely do terribly destructive things because they think going to church (or saying prayers or reading the Bible) makes them good, but it is God's spirit that makes us good.  isn't it time you let go of your fear of germs (of human actions) and embrace the purposed protection of God?
