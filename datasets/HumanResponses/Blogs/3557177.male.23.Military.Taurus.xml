      Lo, I cry not in vane hope that I may actually weep for it is not now so. Dry by hard wrought sorrow. Saddened as all to oft that I am by humanity's continual inhumanitie. So simple and meek in gentle reasoning just to swallow beatific life nary convoling from indelicate poison. Rape my friends and enact through hands owning my arms the choicest violence at your consort. We will not be bowed, nor coerced into obscurity. Defeat in Fields of pain, benign indifference or penultimate ecstasy - it is not ours to shoulder. We are freer then ever you would carve us. We are now and all is joy.  Sorry, normal writing can not come close to expressing the night I've had so...

      It has been a number of days since I last posted, primarily because I have actually been busy for a change.  Ah questions, questions, questions... Questions of self, questions of the most pretentiously existential nature. A young man then cast on tawny seas, crossing the tumultuous straits of puritanical id on vice bound raft; the ego...  A brief recap is perhaps in order:  Fri - extremely busy day at work, multiple large bookings to keep the staff amused...T's friend 'A' remarked how calm and collected I seemed, "life is so much easier that way!", as indeed it is... Painted and read the rest of this day. Sat - Work from noon until about 8, went and watch DVD's with E. Nice apartment she has too. Older building adjacent to smith & coheys. Internally quite curiously divided so that some of its labyrinthine structure is at split levels to the rest but the stud height thru out remains constant. Consequently, I (standing 173cm tall) managed to concuss myself on the top of the door frame to one room in particular several times during the course of the evening! Watched 'Riplys Game' and 'In America' as silhouettes of small rodents transversed the sill outside the TV room window ("Did you snog her?" "No I didn't..." "Did you snog her!?" "NO!!! Besides which she has a boyfriend." "Hasn't stopped her before." "True..."). Went out to Bass Bar afterward and got drunk, aren't I clever! I find it mildly alarming that some peoples idea of extreme sex is being bitten mid-coitus!!! Sun - Slept, mostly....Mostly. Oh yes and formulating my plan for world domination. Mon - Drawing, reading, listening to music and looking at BBW porn. Oh yes and formulating my plan for world domination. (It's a complicated plan ALRIGHT! Taking over the biosphere isn't as simple as it sounds!) Tues - Grocery shopping, coffee and three hour rave over a sixer of beer with my Da, then work. Jam packed for a Tuesday night. Its amazing what a few measly column inches in glossy mag will do! Kiss B's (nice tummy) friend on the hand as she leaves and flash patented bedroom eyes (fuck I'm such a cheesy cunt!), she says we should hook up sometime. Now if only I could remember her name....  So you want to be a mythical ancient Greek hero...  Step #1) Feast. Step #2) Drink. Step #3) Make frequent sacrifices to multiple wrothful deity's, preferably said rituals should involve on mass feasting and drinking. Step #4) After much feasting, drinking and sacrificing talk wistfully of your legion fallen comrades, cry like a bitch.  Step #5) Repeat steps 1 thru 4 until struck down by wrothful deity whom has finally had enough of you pissing and moaning about your dead army buddies. The End.

      Its peculiar, it can be said (with taking any personal unbrage) that most of the time I am a fairly excitable individual. Duly of course the people around me become used to my flamboyant and occasional disturbing behavior. So when I find myself in a state of relative calm, my friends and associates assume something must be the matter. "Are you pissed off with me?" No, I'm just not bouncing off walls like I normally do!  Indeed for the last couple of days I have found myself much more serene than usual for reasons I can not fathom.  Showed a fried of mine who wants to get into photography a book by surblime auteur of the photographic discipline; Ralph Gibson!!! The bold marriage of contrasts, the lithe congregate of hues, what masterful eye for the equanimitable compositions, both considered and serendipitous! - And I gave her a  roll of film...Now fly my pretties! Ah ha ha ha!!!  ...Er, I mean I hope she has fun.

      Woohaa! Did my first shift as a gainfully re-employed individual last night, and it felt  good ! Feels even better to be off welfare... Also gave some advice to a friend of mine a few nights ago concerning her love life - and guess what? It actual helped, good god, if only I was as sagely with my own love life as I am with others...  Does it strike anyone else that the so called modern art movement that arose in Paris during the early nineteen hundreds really should have been classified as neo-primitivism. As much as Piccaso's transistion from the traditional cabal of depictory realism towards a freer, more abstracted mode of expression was inspired by his anachistic sympathies and the work of his impressionist contemporaries, aesthetically his emerging stylistic leanings were bourn more from an appreciation of ancient Spanish sculpture and African folk art. His work from  Demoiselles d'Avignon  onwards was for him it would seem a reconnection to the rawness of "savage art". What's modern about that? While we're at it let re-label the Futurists the "misogynistic industrialist twats"...  Anyway who cares, everything he did after his "rose period" sucked ass!  So, I'm working with dear friend of mine to try and establish some sort of coherent order and direction in my life. I'm to start (according to him atleast) by clearly defining what my values are and creating a foundation from there. Its an odd process, purely because its something you would otherwise never contemplate. Imagine your are a fly on the wall (so to speak) eves droppig on a conversation between an individual close to you and another - what would you most desire to hear by way of complimentary descriptions of your own personage? These hypothetical praises can then, it is concluded, be demarcated as your true values....  Or something like that....  "You'll have to excuse me, I'm ovulating!"  -T

      Jesus, I shouldn't smoke so much, my lungs feel like someone scraped them out with a wire brush. Queens of the stone age on high rotate this morning. Despite the fact that I am by in large a ery social person I enjoy these more solitary mornings, wondering round the house drinking copious amounts of coffee and singing to myself at the top of my voice.  Came to a reasonable finacial compromise with the old man last night that hopefully won't inhibit my ability to move out asap. One of my mates is actually looking for a flaty right now so I might have to Have a talk with her soon, the only problem being that I work with her and I'm not sure if it would be a good idea to live with her too. I do however utterly adore her, she is one of the sweetest girls I have ever meet and tolerates my multitude of personal vulgaritys with easy repose (+ she has a magnificent ass).  I keep bumping into all these people I used to know when I was about 17 or 18... A couple of nights ago I chanced across the sister of one of my old highschool buddies at one of my favorite watering holes; A stunning rubinesc ozzie girl, quick with a joke and quicker to laugh! I gave her my number and told her to give me a bell, it would interesting to find out what my old clique is up to now.  Looks like a boring day of domestic mundanitys ahead of me today, with any luck my "man" will show soon so I can at least get high while I'm doing the laundry...

      Well well well, my first blog entry... Where to begin? A little about myself perhaps. The vital statistics; 175 cm tall, very skinny, brown eyes, enjoy long walks on the beach...Wait a minute that's not right! I live on small island on ass side of the planet, I work in a bar watering the parched and ungrateful masses hobbies include drinking, smoking, fucking and generally making a cock out of myself.  I finally got a job again after having spent about a month being unemployed (which completely sucked), the irony being that the outfit that fired me (for abandonment of employment after I went missing for a week for no discernible reason) has ended up rehiring me because the guy that replaced me was such a complete gimboid that they figured "hey, better the devil you know...".  In the mean time I've been crashing on my dads lounge room floor which has been ok albeit a rather humiliating flat mate is moving out soon though and he really wants me to start paying rent, which I am loath to do because I need to save up some money so I can get the fuck out of here.Looks like my freeloading days are numbered (damnit!). The upshot of this perhaps somewhat cumbersome familial entanglement is that I have had the opportunity to make some music on my dads kit (which he him self never uses, go figure!), I was only recording it on my old clapped out four track but fuck me it sounded good, I was so stoked! I've been trying for years to make this kind of music and suddenly - under the most messed up of circumstances - I have been endowed with the ability to make sounds I hae hither to only imagined.  Ain't life grand!
