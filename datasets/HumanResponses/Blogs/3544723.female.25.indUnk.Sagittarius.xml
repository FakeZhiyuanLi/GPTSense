         Something horrible happened...Jell-O died...   Woke up at 6:30am and fed Jell-O before heading off to  urlLink Tai Fu Tai Mansion . I was getting ready while he was eating in the room energetically waging his little tail. Knowing that I wouldn't be home until late, I've decided to leave him in the room so he can walk around and play w/ his toys. What a big mistake...  When I got home, I went straight to the room to check on him and see if he's hungry. I was shocked when I saw him lying on the floor lifeless. There were puke spots all over the room and it was obvious that he had been barfing the whole time. I was horrified! I kept calling his name without getting any response from him whatsoever. I touched him only to find that his little body has hardened. Staring at him helplessly for an hour or so, I've accepted the fact that he had died. I kept looking for cues that had caused his death. After examining the room, I’ve come to the conclusion that he had probably consumed some dry cleansing agent and drank some liquid cleanser that were placed behind a white broad. I didn't even know those products were in the room since a white broad was lying in the front. Only if I knew...  There was nothing I could do, except to slowly wrap him up with his little towel and put him in a box. I brought the box over to my frd and asked him to dispose Jell-O. I didn't wanna know how and where he’s gonna do it. I couldn't do it myself...it's simply too cruel.  Jell-O's a super cute and obedient toy pom that's really hard to find...so sad...even my mom loves him, which is rare since she doesn't like dogs that much. Superstitiously speaking, she said Jell-O had blocked sth awful that might happen to me. But whenever I think of the way he looked when he died gives me major heartache. Poor little baby...Mommy will always love you and miss you...

      Woke up with major hang over and found some chocolate and cookie crumbs in Jell-O's bowl. Apparently I mistakenly fed him with my junk food instead of his dog food when I was drunk. He must loved his meal. It was a very big one too! To confirm what I've done, I immediately picked up Jell-O and checked his stomach. It was HUGE! And he looked hilarious! Imagine a little dog with chocolate leftovers around his mouth and a huge tummy walking around like a pregnant woman! LOL!     Fearing that he might gain weight, I put him on the treadmill to burn off the extra calories. He actually loved it!      When I turned off the treadmill after 5 minutes, he kept walking on it back and forth wondering how come it's no longer moving. Haha my baby's SO CUTE!!

      Someone leaked a significant portion of the Microsoft Windows source code to the Internet during the early months of 2004 so it's more important than ever to use antivirus software on any Windows PC. What to do now?  Try  urlLink Grisoft's AVG Free Edition , it's free for personal use.   Or if your preinstalled antivirus software is no longer updating, uninstall it immediately and run the  urlLink free HouseCall service  to clean up any current infections.  Then go download Lavasoft's  urlLink free Ad-aware Standard Edition  to remove any spyware from the computer.  Lastly, remember to go to Windows Update (conveniently accessible from Internet Explorer by selecting Tools | Windows Update)!!  C'mon peeps, don't help spread viruses!   Derek : Another one! This time for SPCA!! We'll be here cheering for ya!              Ed : You look great in the commercial! How do you mange to look so good all da time? We hate you!   H : Nice to hear from you again my dear frd from Moscow!    Ivan : Yeah I'll give you a shout for sure! We should definitely catch up!   James : My experience of being a stay home mother is ok since Jell-O's not a noisy one. However, it does require undivided attention or he'll feel upset and abandoned. And no, I can't bring him to the bar cuz he's underage and is to drink. Maybe when he gets older then we can have beer together when you visit HK. I'm confident that he'll beat you in drinking games!      Jan : Thanks for the details! It was very helpful! And yes, I'm planning to go with the Contiki Tour and am checking out their trips now. They have so many cool trips, so hard to choose!

All of a sudden I look feminine and I love it! It looks so real!! If take good care of it, the stylist said it can last for 2 - 3 months. Well knowing me...I wonder if it'll last for a month!   Angie : Congrats to your engagement!! Have you set the date yet?   Clement : Wut's your decision? Cheer up!   Mike : No way I'm taking pic with THAT hair! HAHA too bad!  Yeah Jell-O is super cute! Jennifer would love him too!

      Hi Folks,   This is a bit of a warning: look after your chompers, yer gnashers! And don't ignore those postcards from your dentist telling you to come in for a check up.   I've always been scared of the dentist and never go to them unless I'm in extreme agony. Over the holiday weekend I was hit by an attack of toothache, real bad toothache. I tried eating ice-creams, lots of ice-cream etc. but nothing got rid of the bugger.   Couldn't sleep, couldn't concentrate, couldn't do anything! Now I'm looking for a dentist in Hong Kong, preferably female. Someone PLEASE if you know of any, lemme know!  Don't forget, look after your 'amstesds.     Just For Grins  How's your business coming along?   "I'm looking for a new cashier."   But you had a new one only last week!   "That's the one I'm looking for."    An Inspirational Thought :  Tony Robbins said,  "Now I am the voice I lead not follow I create not destroy I believe not doubt I am a force for good Defying all the odds I step up, step up, step up And take action And if I can't then I MUST!"

        Had a very informative outing today thanks to Barbara!  Once everyone showed up, we headed off to Tai Wo and from the station, we walked through the old Tai Po Market, still living and breathing as it did more than 50 years ago. This market has everything from clothing to live animals to flowers for the table. We visited Man Mo temple dating back to 1892 as well as the  urlLink Railway museum . I was so excited and eager to learn about HK. After all, I was born here!   Early History  Tai Po has a long history, shown by Stone Age relies being found at a small island off Yuen Chau Tsai, Tai Po (now reclaimed land). Tai Po was originally called Dai Bu, meaning 'walk in big steps to escape from evil', because in ancient times the district was heavily forested and home to wild animals who threatened the lives of local residents. The Lam Tsuen River flows through Tai Po, leading out to the Tolo Harbour.   Settlement  By AD 618 (Tang Dynasty), the Tai Po district had become one of the earliest settled areas in Hong Kong. It was then known as 'Hui Chou Ying'. Also by this time fishing, farming and pearl fishing (in the Tolo Harbour) were the main industries. By AD 905 it had become the centre of the pearl trade. However this was an extremely dangerous industry in which to be, as pearl drivers were submerged on weighted ropes, and would only be pulled up when the driver tugged on his rope, indicating he'd run out of breath. He then hoped he'd be pulled up! Pearl drivers dived in the nude, as it minimized places to conceal stolen pearls. The pearls went to the treasure house of the Imperial family. The industry was eventually proscribed as there were so many deaths among the drivers.  - A source of further information can be found and seen at the excellent 'Story of Hong Kong' exhibition at the equally excellent 'Museum of History' in Tsim Sha Tsui East.   Market History  Tai Po's population slowly grew over the years and by AD 1368 (Ming Dynasty) it had become a market town and home to one of the territories original clans, the Tangs. In 1691 they set up the original (and one of HK's earliest) agricultural produce markets north of the river. This was called 'The Old Market'.  Meanwhile the Man Clan had also established themselves south of the river, and the Tang clan charged them exorbitant ferry fees to cross the river to get to the market. As the district grew and prospered, the Man clan, by the late 19th century, formed a union ('Tsat Yeuk') with seven nearby villages (Cheung Shu Tan, Fan Ling, Lam Tsuen, Tai Heung, Ting Kok, Tsap Wo and Yap Wo) and established a rival market 'Tai Wo Shi' in Fu shin Street on the south bank of the river. This was called 'The New Market'.  In 1892, to celebrate the establishment of The New Marker, the Tsat Yeuk Rural Committee built the Man Mo temple as well as roads adjacent to it, further developing the town area. In 1896 a bridge called Kwong Fuk Bridge, was built across the river linking both areas of Tai Po. It was renovated and widened in 1957.  The 'Old Market' gradually lost business to the New Market slowly faded away. The New Market was what we saw today - but is now called the Old Market!! Today, the market sells myriad of fresh produce as well as clothes and kitchen hardware.   The Hakka  In the market we saw old ladies wearing broad brimmed hats surrounded by black gauze. These are 'Hakka' natives, which is a Cantonese pronunciation of a Mandarin word meaning "guest people", as they originally came from North China. In the market they sell supposedly chemical free fresh vegetables.   1000 year old eggs  Black, '1000 year old eggs', which actually take 100 days to make. These are duck eggs coated with a clay like mixture comprising tea, salt, lime and pinewood and charcoal ashes. They are then covered with soil and placed in a crock for 100 days to cure, after which the clay mixture is rinsed off and the eggs can be eaten. The while of the egg will be a greyish, translucent colour (or blackish amber colour) and have a gelatinous texture. The yolk, when sliced will be a greyish-greenish colour.   The Man Mo Temple  In 1892, the Tsat Yeuk Rural Committee built the Man Mo temple. In its early years the temple was not quite like we see it today, as it was also used for administrative purposes by the committee and was a stopping place for onward travelers to stay overnight. In 1985 it was fully renovated, with government funds and input by the Rural committee, to what it is today. The temple is dedicated to Man-D, a King and God of Literature, and Mo-D, also a King and god of Business and Health. At the main altar, Man-D is the God on the right with Mo-D on the left. To the left of the main altar is another altar, dedicated to Kwun Yum, the Goddess of Mercy.  To enter the temple, we were told to extend our left foot first, then cross over(not on) the threshold. Forgot the reason for it but if I rmbr correctly, it has sth to do with the evil. If we trip while crossing over, it either means the step forbids the evil (in us) from entering OR it means the person who trips over IS the devil! We then walked around the side of the inner door. The temple is as smoky and incense-coil filled as most other temples in Hong Kong. In there, people can participate in the shaking of fortune stick from the container and have the results told by the interpreter sitting at the side. It's only in Cantonese and costs $20 for foreigners.  After hours of walking and sight-seeing, we sure had worked up an appetite. We had lunch at an Indian restaurant call Shalimar Indian Restaurant and boy oh boy was that delicious! I wish I could see there and eat all day! Curry and nan...YUMMY!!    Was already falling asleep during the ride home and it was only 3:30pm! What a fun-packing and knowledgeable day!  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shalimar Indian Restaurant Address 127 Kwong Fuk Road G/F Tai Po Market, NT

          urlLink More   The weather was great, the captain was cute, and we all had a great time! We departed the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club at 10:30am to sail on the beautiful seas around HK on a 45 foot yacht. We all started working as a team once we got on broad. Sailing isn't as easy as it seems! There were a lot of pulling, swirling, and reefing. Got so tired already when we were in the middle of the sea!  As we were draping on the shallow part of the water, we joked about hitting the rocks on the side where it might become a major, or last for that matter, moment of our lives. Just when we were laughing, we heard this big noise and it was obvious that we've hit something under the water. Our boat was swinging frantically and it did look like we were gonna flipped! Physically speaking, it wouldn't be possible cuz the direction of the wind and the tide just wouldn't let the boat flip. But put physics aside, the situation did seem a bit creepy as the boat kept hitting whatever it was hitting and the impact was making this drum noise as if it's breaking our boat. Some panicked and thought we were sinking. We immediately got busy and reefed to release the power of the wind. It was so all of a sudden I got blisters on my hand afterwards. Ouch!   Once things got under control, we referred back to the chart to see if we've hit a rock. Nothing was on the chart! Our guess was that we just got to the shallow part during low tide without paying much attn to it since we were having too much fun. But heck was it exciting!    Now that I'm home, I'm still feeling the sea. Seem strange walking on land again and I'm feeling the waves as I sit. Aside from some sailing skills and imaginary waves I brought home, I also brought home a very red, tanned body along with countless bruises covered in painful sunburns. But who cares?! It's hella fun!    ...  Missing Jell-O...
