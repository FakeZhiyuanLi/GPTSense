       Watch  urlLink this video , where Teresa Heinz calls us conservatives "un-American," then lies about it, and then proceeds to storm up to a reporter and tell him to "shove it."

       Last night (Thursday, July 22), MSNBC's Scarborough Country featured another follow-up segment on Annie Jacobsen's article "Terror in the Skies, Again?" The transcripts from that segment are below and are worth a read.  SCARBOROUGH:  Hey, we've been discussing Northwest Flight 327 all week. The behavior of 14 Middle Eastern men was enough to make one couple fear the worst.  Fortunately, the flight landed safely and was met by federal authorities.  But, as WNBC's investigative reporter Scott Weinberger discovered, in questioning the 14 men, the federal officers failed to uncover a key piece of information.  Here's Scott's recap of the story and his shocking discovery.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  SCOTT WEINBERGER, WNBC REPORTER (voice-over):  Ann Jacobsen and her husband, Kevin, along with their 4 1/2-year-old son, were on that flight. And before the gate even left the gate, she says her husband already had an uneasy feeling.  ANNIE JACOBSEN, JOURNALIST:  Kevin turned me to me and said, I think we should get off this flight.  And we didn't.  WEINBERGER:  But at that point, the couple felt like their concerns could have just been nerves.  But that reasoning would not last long.  KEVIN JACOBSEN, ABOARD NORTHWEST AIRLINES FLIGHT:  Well, I noticed when the gentleman went to the restroom with a yellow T-shirt, passes his seat. And when he gets to the middle of the flight, he gives the thumbs up to two or three other Middle Eastern men sitting behind him, and then continues back to the rear of the flight.  There was one of the Middle Eastern sitting in first class, and he was wearing sunglasses. He was also always standing right in front of the cockpit door.  A. JACOBSEN:  I said, honey, I think you should talk to the flight attendant.  K. JACOBSEN:  She said, we are aware of it.  The pilot is aware of it. She said that, we are passing notes to each other.  Then, when they were passing drinks, the flight attendant came over to me and she leaned down and she whispered and she said that there are air marshals sitting all around you.  WEINBERGER:  But sources say the federal air marshals chose not to act, maintaining their undercover role, but prepared if the men made a move to hijack the aircraft.  But that would not happen.  The plane would land safely in Los Angeles, and the men questioned by the FBI and the U.S. immigration authorities. Sources say they told investigators they were a group of musicians from Syria traveling to a gig near Los Angeles.  Agents, we're told, ran the men through every possible data bank and terrorist watch list.  But nothing came back, so they were released.  Several sources tell News Channel 4 that all 14 men were traveling with expired visas.  And sources say federal agents who spent several hours with the men failed at one of the most simple of tasks, just checking the date.  (END VIDEOTAPE)  SCARBOROUGH:  With me now is WNBC reporter investigative report Scott Weinberger.  Scott, FBI member and immigration people sat down with these men.  They questioned them.  And, of course, afterwards they said, hey, everything checked out.  But everything didn‘t really check out.  These people missed something as simple as visas that were expired.  How did that happen?  WEINBERGER:  Well, Joe, let's talk about what we know happened right before the plane landed.  We know that several of the passengers talked to the flight attendants and gave them information.  That information was then given to the pilot.  The pilot called ahead and told authorities that when the plane lands, they need help.  They need people to come to the aircraft and take care of the situation.  When the aircraft landed in Los Angeles, it was met by several agents of the JTTF, joint terrorism task force, as well as ICE, which is Immigration Customs Enforcements.  They took the gentleman off the plane. They did what they called an interview.  It was not an interrogation. There was no criminal activity, not a reason to do the interrogation part of it.  But they interviewed them all individually.  And it went on, Joe, for probably almost two hours.  Now, they looked at the big picture.  Is this a situation of terrorism?  Are these people at all possibly connected with any form or links of terrorism?  They went through various lists that they have in a database which is stored in all the major law enforcement computer.  After going through all those things, now, Joe, looking at the big picture of terrorism, something like a visa would be an easy question to ask.  We know and my sources are telling me that each individual member that they talked to, these 12 people or so, the 14, they took their visa and made copies of them and put them as part of an investigative file.  But my sources are telling me that the investigators never looked down to check the date.  The expiration was three weeks prior to the flight ever taking off.  SCARBOROUGH:  That's remarkable.  So you have immigration officials there. You have FBI officials there.  WEINBERGER:  That's right.  SCARBOROUGH:  Law enforcement people swarming around these men.  And the most basic of questions, "Are you in the United States legally?" was a question that they botched.  These guys -- I have been talking about Inspector Clouseau as it relates to Sandy Berger and his bumbling in classified documents.  It looks they're like a bunch of Inspector Clouseaus around here that couldn't even answer the basic question of whether these 14 Syrians who are suspected of terrorism were in the United States legally.  I would guess the FBI and the immigration authorities have to be very embarrassed by what you've uncovered.  WEINBERGER:  Well, red-faced to say the least, Joe, for sure.  But, at this point, really what they have to look at is what is the level of concern when these men come to shore, when they make it to Los Angeles?  And I guess at this point, from what my sources are telling me, is, they wanted to go first and look at the bigger picture.  Are these gentlemen involved in terrorism?  And, at the end of the day, they let them go without ever checking the expiration date on the visa.  SCARBOROUGH:  Unbelievable.  I would say one of the biggest issues would be, are these men in the country legally?  I can't believe they bobbled that one.  I want to bring in right now, though, Michael Smerconish.  He's a radio talk show host.  He is also the author of the upcoming book, "Flying Blind: How Political Correctness Continues to Compromise Airline Safety Post 9/11."  And I also want to bring in flight attendant Deborah Volpe.  Let's start with you, though, Michael.  Are you surprised by what you're hearing about this flight, where 14 Syrians are allowed to run around the plane?  And I'm just going to come out and say it.  If 14 Anglo-Saxon high school students from Kansas who were on a band trip to Los Angeles did the same thing, the flight attendants would go back and tell them to sit down and put their seat belts on.  Do you think political correctness played into the fact that they let these 14 Syrians run around the plane and break all the rules?  MICHAEL SMERCONISH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST:  Absolutely.  Absolutely, Joe.  It is a no-brainer.  And it is symptomatic of what's going on with regard to airline security.  The fact of the matter is, we are in a war against Arab religious extremists.  And nobody wants to face that fact. And, instead, we walk around literally flying blind to the fact that the 19 hijackers on 9/11 had a variety of commonalities.    And those commonalities were their country of origin or countries of origin.  They were all from the Northeast.  They are all follower of Islam.  Dare I say, they all look alike.  And people just don't want to these factors into consideration.  And I think it is insanity.  I‘m for this administration, but it's the Bush administration that will not come to terms with the reality of the enemy that we face.  SCARBOROUGH:  OK, what are the dangers here, though, that you -- by making these overgeneralizations, a lot of civil libertarians are saying, hey, you are sounding just like FDR in 1942 when he started throwing Japanese into interment camps.  How do you separate those two activities, the rights of Arab-Americans to move freely across the United States and the needs of this country to protect itself from some people that, you know -- you can narrow it down, the people that want to blow up American targets, the chances are good, they are going to be Islamic extremists.  They are going to be males.  They are going to be like 20 to 45 years old.  How do you balance those conflicting needs?  SMERCONISH:  I have to tell, Joe, that when you put civil liberties in one hand and when you put the common good and protecting Americans in the other, I think that that balance tips in favor of protecting America.  I flew to Florida recently and my 8-year-old son was singled out for secondary questioning.  Now, that's insanity.  And in the words of John Lehman of the 9/11 Commission, we have got to stop the process of pulling out of line 85-year-old women with aluminum walkers.  I am simply saying what your audience is thinking.  And no one else wants to have this conversation.  And if I might add, having perused the 500-plus pages of that report today, unfortunately, they failed to deal with this issue.  SCARBOROUGH:  And I don't know why people can't say what you've come out  and said.  The fact is, we are at war right now with Islamic terrorists. Does that mean all Arabs are bad?  No.  But it means that we are at war right now with Islamic terrorists who want to destroy our way of life.  (CROSSTALK)  SCARBOROUGH:  Go ahead.  SMERCONISH:  If you'll pardon me this, I'm not saying that you pull out of line and give the rubber hose and the stack of phone books to everybody who is of Arab descent.  But common sense dictates that if a group of 14 Arab males in that age group are flying together, before they get on that plane in Detroit headed for L.a., they are the ones who need to be subject to secondary screening.  SCARBOROUGH:  And not your 8-year-old son.  Deborah, let me bring you in here.  What is a flight attendant's role?  I know you responded to our show with an e-mail after you saw the original interview with the Jacobsens. Have you seen similar incidents on your flights?  DEBORAH VOLPE, FLIGHT ATTENDANT:  We're really concerned about erratic behavior by any passenger, irregardless of their ethnic background.  And we have seen different types of situations occur.  And it runs the gamut from if it is one particular religious group or one ethnic background.  So, flight attendants are very concerned that we don‘t have specific airline security training that address these issues.  The flight deck, some pilots have guns.  We have some air marshals, but the flight attendants, the last line of defense, we have nothing.  SCARBOROUGH:  Why not?  VOLPE:  Ask our politicians.  SCARBOROUGH:  Why not?  VOLPE:  Well, it's really -- it was mandated that we were supposed to get airline security training.  The TSA has left this up to the individual airline management teams to come up with these security programs, these training programs, which are not effective.  Some run anywhere from a six-minute video to maybe two hours.  And, at this point, we're waiting for the TSA to mandate this.  They mandate certain things, but not the most basic things that can be taken care of that won't cost the airline a dime.  SCARBOROUGH:  And, you know, you're exactly right, Deborah.  Flight attendants are the last line of defense.  Thanks for being with us.  Michael, thank you.  Scott, we greatly appreciate it.  Great report.  We'll be right back in SCARBOROUGH COUNTRY in a second.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  SCARBOROUGH:  You know we want to hear from you.  If you were on Northwest Flight 327, please e-mail us at  urlLink Joe@MSNBC.com .  We want to talk to you and we want to get you on our show.

        The Washington Post   urlLink  sat  on the  urlLink Terror in the Skies  story for two weeks and finally  The Washington Times  reports more suspicious incidents. Read  Scouting jetliners for new attacks :   A second pilot said that, on one of his recent flights, an air marshal forced his way into the lavatory at the front of his plane after a man of Middle Eastern descent locked himself in for a long period. The marshal found the mirror had been removed and the man was attempting to break through the wall. The cockpit was on the other side. The second pilot said terrorists are "absolutely" testing security.  Folks, we need to remain vigilant!

        urlLink Rick Roberts  was recently contacted by a listener named Spencer Woods. Spencer has been flying his American Flag since 1992 out in front of his condo in Sabre Springs. He recently received two notices from his property managers at  urlLink Menas Realty  to remove his flag, or suffer possible penalties and/or fines. He’s scheduled to go before the condo association July 27th. If you have had an experience like this, you should know that:   According to  urlLink CA Government Code: Section 434.5, General Provision 1353.5 (b) , the right to fly the Flag of The United States of America on your property supercedes condo association CC&Rs. The law not only provides for display on your property ‘on a pole or staff’, it also allows the Flag to be flown in ‘exclusive use’ areas such as patios and yards.  However, Menas Realty does not consider the front of his garage as part of his exclusive use area. CC&Rs can be ridiculous! What is so offensive about seeing our Flag flying free?

Every person that drives by Marine Corps Air Station Miramar (along I-15) will see that they are driving on the 'Semper Fi Highway'. They'll know that they are passing by the home of 'The Few, The Proud, The Marines!'

        urlLink Kerry on abortion :  I believe life does begin at conception.   So, why did he vote AGAINST the  urlLink Unborn Victims of Violence Act  (Laci and Conner's Law)?! Thank God President Bush has common sense and signed the bill.    Kerry on Iraq:  I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.  Huh? Does someone have amnesia?

       It makes me sick that any vet would be  insulted like this , especially during a Fourth of July parade!  How un-American...  It was such a public humiliation -- home front insult after battlefield injury.  Thank you, Jason Gilson, for bravely serving our country in Iraq.

        International team to monitor presidential election ...   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe was invited to monitor the election by the State Department.  This is absolutely the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard of!  We do NOT need the OSCE in America!  I love what Mike Reagan had to say...    Reagan: Selling America out to 13 Democrats   For some insane reason the State Department has caved in to the outrageous demands of 13 House Democrats that foreign observers be invited to monitor the fall presidential election.  The OSCE¹s job is to look at Third World countries and banana republics and monitor their elections. The United States is neither a Third World country nor a banana republic, and we can run our own elections, thank you.  We have the freest and fairest elections in the world, and what Washington has now done is to tell the world that we have done something terribly wrong and must be watched.

       According to the book Unfit for Command written by veterans serving with Kerry, two of John Kerry's three Purple Heart decorations resulted from self-inflicted wounds, not suffered under enemy fire. They go on to say:  *All three of Kerry's Purple Hearts were for minor injuries, not requiring a single hour of hospitalization.  *A "fanny wound" was the highlight of Kerry's much touted "no man left behind" Bronze Star.  *Kerry turned the tragic death of a father and small child in a Vietnamese fishing boat into an act of "heroism" by filing a false report on the incident.  *Kerry entered an abandoned Vietnamese village and slaughtered the domestic animals owned by the civilians and burned down their homes with his Zippo lighter.  *Kerry's reckless behavior convinced his colleagues that he had to go -- becoming the only Swift Boat veteran to serve only four months.   The book will be released August 15.  urlLink Click here  for a free chapter ("The Purple Heart Hunter") from Unfit for Command. For more on this story, visit  urlLink drudgereport.com

        Springsteen headlines anti-Bush musical coalition . Other idiots participating include Bonnie Raitt, Dave Matthews Band, Dixie Chicks, Jackson Brown, John Mellencamp, Ben Harper, Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds, Pearl Jam, R.E.M, and Ben Harper.  They need to wake up and realize America has already "come together", but not for Kerry:  John Kerry becomes the first presidential candidate since 1972 to receive a negative bounce from his convention. Kerry’s performance in Gallup's post-convention poll is even worse than George McGovern’s in 1972, making it the worst convention bounce in Gallup’s history of presidential campaign polling.  No incumbent president has ever lost re-election when leading in the Gallup poll after his opponent's convention.  Source:  urlLink http://www.georgewbush.com

       In about 90 days, the fate of the world will be decided. The president of the United States, the most powerful man in the world, could have a voting record more liberal than Ted Kennedy's.  John Kerry came back from Vietnam and accused his fellow veterans of committing war crimes, threw his ribbons over the White House fence in a protest, voted for dozens of cuts in defense and intelligence budgets, consistently opposed Ronald Reagan in the fight against Communism, and gave aid and comfort to Communist leaders from the Sandinistas to Castro.  Kerry voted against the first Gulf War and was one of only 12 ultra-liberal senators to vote against funding our troops currently in Iraq and Afghanistan. Do you really want to see John Kerry as president? Do you want Osama Bin Laden grinning from ear to ear on November 2, 2004?  Every  urlLink Wictory Wednesday , I ask my readers to  urlLink volunteer  and/or  urlLink donate  to the Bush 2004 campaign. If you've already  urlLink donated  and  urlLink volunteered  for the Bush campaign, then talk to your friends and enlist them in this battle for America's very soul.

       The alphabet networks need to tell America the truth about Kerry's voting record.  He's been a consistent  no-show in the intelligence committee .  When he does show up, he's a failure.  "For example, in 1993 after the World Trade Center bombing Senator Kerry introduced a number of measures that were to reduce funding for the intelligence community by $7.5 billion, including a bill that he introduced in 1995 that called for the reduction in funding for the intelligence committees and intelligence communities by $300 million a year for five consecutive years," Chambliss said.  Chambliss points out those five years led up to Sept. 11. Kerry did not get any co-sponsors on that bill.  "He's been in the Senate for 20 years," said Chambliss. "Nobody has come to the platform to say, 'This is what John Kerry has done in his 20 years in the Senate.' They're not doing that because they can't do that."  Yes, you liberals it is a fact - Kerry has missed 38 of 49 public hearings in 8 years - and this is the guy you want for President?  I don't get it, but then again I still don't see how Bush is to blame for 9/11.  He was in office only 8 months when the attack occurred; Slick Willie had 8 years to prepare.

        Heinz Kerry: Four More Years   When a Bush supporter with a bullhorn shouted "four more years" from the back of a large crowd packed into a downtown Milwaukee park, Heinz Kerry, who was introducing her husband, responded: "They want four more years of hell."  The Kerry's have hardly been living in hell -  urlLink take a look .  It's no wonder why Americans don't embrace the Kerry's!  Taking his turn at the podium, Kerry praised his wife's bluntness and then added, "I want to thank George Bush for sending the goons here tonight to excite us to do a little more work."   Herman Munster look-alike has the nerve to call Bush supporters goons?!  LOL.   urlLink

        Dem's Marine Misfire   "He imposed on us and I disagree with him coming over here shaking our hands," one Marine said, adding, "I'm 100 percent against [him]."  A sergeant with 10 years of service under his belt said, "I speak for all of us. We think that we are doing the right thing in Iraq," before saying he is to be deployed there in a few weeks and is "eager" to go and serve.
