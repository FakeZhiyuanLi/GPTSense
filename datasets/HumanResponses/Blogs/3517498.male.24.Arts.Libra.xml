      yesterday the writers were fired.    why were they fired?    because they were difficult to work with and didn't produce enough quality work for what they were asking for.    why were they asking for so much?    because that's what the ego does.  then the line producer (person that oversees the crew) was fired from the film he is working on now.     why was he fired?    not quite sure.      lesson here?    don't think you're too good to get fired. ;)    what does this mean?    not really sure.  we should still moved ahead as planned. it really shouldn't effect the budget or our tenetive nov 8 start date... but who knows in this business.     YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF...   ignorance.    does it matter that maybe she has found something that connects her to God and makes her happy and fulfilled? no.  all that matters is that "it's not my way so it's the highway."    way to show tolerance and love and understanding there, pope, buddy.  it's just sad that a prominent religious figure, someone that's supposed to uphold the teachings of God, goes around endorsing judgment, ridicule, and unacceptance.      The lapsed-Catholic diva has come under scrutiny from the Vatican because of her support of Kabbalah. The former Material Girl has become the world's highest-profile member of the Kabbalah Centre, a controversial offshoot of Judaism, and has even taken on the Jewish  name Esther. But now, the Vatican is holding a special summit with Catholic leaders from around the world, hammering out a way to deal with so-called "New Age" religions and fads that pose a "threat" to Christianity.  The council, which met last week, singled out "Kabbalah as espoused by Madonna" as well as a number of other faddish religions, according to a report.   "In the past, the Pope has criticized Madonna for the contents of her concerts," says cult expert Rick Ross, who has closely followed the activities of the Kabbalah Centre. "Now, ironically, it has become a theological issue."    IN THE LIGHT OF TRUTH SEEKERS AND STANDING FOR WHAT'S RIGHT...   michael moore's film, FAHRENHEIT 9/11 comes out tomorrow.  i can't wait to see it.  it's going to be fascinating and hoefully open up the eyes of a lot of americans.  i predict that it will effect the outcome of the election this year.  hopefully the people are smart enough to realize that they made a mistake and will get off their revenge-fed high horse, and start seeking out peaceful, economic, and smart solutions to the problems the the bush administration has bestowed upon us.  these past 4 years have been nothing but a succession of quick-tempered reactions to problems who's far-reaching effects are so grand that snap judgment and decision making couldn't possibly solve them.  we need a new leader in office.. someone that is strong, intelligent, and capable of not letting his "don't mess with texas" attitude determine the choices that he makes for the other 250 million people living in his country.    it's unfortunate that we cannot re elect clinton.  for 8 years our country was in an economic prosperity and we were at peace with the world.  granted he had an affair (big deal, i mean do we really need to punish someone just because we can't admit to ourselves that we have our own sins and flaws? grow up), but the things that he accomplished greatly outweigh any one immoralistic thing (what, are the 50% of marriages that fail in the U.S. all attributed to mommy and daddy just deciding that they don't want to live together for no reason?) he did.  we are such an unforgiving public.    people fuck up, get over it.  why can't we impeach bush for sending us to war, putting us in a huge amount of debt, losing millions of people their jobs, bringing the economy to a grinding halt, disregarding mounting evidence of an all too clear threat of global warming, abandoning crucial environmental policies, and supporting amendments to the constitution that are the equivalence of racism, discrimination, and hatred?  things we have worked so hard to fix were all thrown away in one single term.   HYSTERICAL    urlLink Judge.    SO THEY MADE IT INTO SPACE   too awesome.  i couldn't imagine being in a little rocket plane shooting up towards the sky at 25,000 mph only to leave the planet.  theres such a sense of ultimate freedom in that.  one day... if we really don't like it here on earth, we can just leave, without killing ourselves ;).  i wish i could be around for those days.

      i tried that new C2 coke... its ok.. tastes like coke but its missing something.. cant put my finger on it.  also tried the new ginger altoids.. they arent bad.. kinda spicy.. get u in the throat.  so i stumbled upon this website of a pastor that has some pretty rediculous veiws, if i may say so.  normally i wouldnt care but he is talking directly about the properties that we just acquired and that i am working on to develop...    "Warning Signs   Sadly, some of the role-playing activities are more seductive than others. Those who find their friends or loved ones (or even come across new acquaintances) involved with certain role-playing activities are in for a harder fight than others.   Without a doubt, the greatest offender in this category is The Game Studios Publishing. Their printed materials are not the most popular, though my research has shown me that their position is a frightening second-place in the role-playing market. That means their tracts are almost as widely available as Dungeons & Dragons. Additionally, theirs are the most blatant with regard to turning the users into drug maniacs and sexual predators.   Of their titles (and I must confess some degree of confusion as to the nature of their market, as The studio seems also to publish Dungeons & Dragons information, which itself is held in copyright by Wizard of the Coast), most deal with matters of the occult in a much more brazen manner than do Dungeons & Dragons. While a player may represent a spell-caster in a traditional “fantasy” genre, players in The games portray openly evil and occult creatures in all the games. Vampires, goblins, sorcerers and other creatures all populate the World, a “modern-day”-type setting that espouses a “dark Gothic Punk” version of the real world. The most disturbing of these is Demon, of which a source of mine has managed to acquire a pre-press copy.   If I may momentarily diverge from the path I had so far been taking, I do wish to express that not every participant of the role-playing activity must be viewed as a drooling, satanic degenerate. The Demon book that I received came from one of the company’s own writers or “play-testers,” the acolytes and experimenters of the occult industry who serve to prepare this odious material for public consumption. I can only assume that my contact’s exposure to the moral turpitude of the Demon title caused him enough remorse that he saw his ethical impetus align itself to a more admirable degree (and I have counseled him when he felt imperiled by homosexuality). God’s love is infinite, and even a cult-member can return to the Lord’s favor by acknowledging his period of straying and rejoining the fold. But I digress.  Demon represents a new depth even for The Game Studios Publishing, previously known for such principled exercises in evil as Vampires and Mage, the former of which has contributed to murder conspiracies* and the latter of which espouses a belief system of a most pagan and dangerous nature as well as openly encouraging sexual deviancy and fornication as well as Catholicism**.   Demon differs in that its characters do not even belong to marginalized groups such as vampires or werewolves. They are literal demons loosed on Earth by a vanished Lucifer, and the actions of the characters in the game concern themselves with finding and restoring to power their vanished patron. Other demonic activities explored in the game include the politics of the various “houses” of demons; each house corresponds to a specific archetype of demons in the hierarchy of Hell (some are attuned to the Seven Deadly Sins while others tempt mortals into indulging their darker impulses, etc.). Demons have supernatural power in the game that seem to correspond to actual occult practices, and it is by the symbolic use of these powers by characters in the game that I believe The game studio attempts to foster the real cultivation of such powers in its players. These ideas are even finding support within the intellectual community trivializing the nature of demons by dismissing them as "myths".   The True Problem   Without fail, participants in the role-playing activity find themselves exposed to the occult, whether indirectly (as a result of thematic elements in the games) or directly (as a result of learning witchcraft from the game books themselves or the naked, pagan rites of the drooling sex perverts). As good Christians, it is obviously our duty to prevent our youth from learning the corrupt ways these books and games teach. Sex, suicide, drug abuse, homosexuality, “golden showers” and many other behaviors proscribed by the Lord and the Good Book come as a result of players taking their games too far. In particular, the moral execration contained with the Demon book takes these aberrations to new levels by openly encouraging players to act in the interests of Satan (or Lucifer, as he is depicted herein).  Additionally, role-playing games teach that violence is an acceptable and even admirable way of solving problems. Significant portions of their rules are devoted to combat and weaponry. Demon, for example, also contains systems by which the satanic characters can attack or use magic upon their enemies, with dark arts spawned from Hell itself. These are not unlike the gay community’s reactionary “straight bashing” in response to the more physical efforts of their loving fellows (but loving in the Lord’s intended way) to bring them back into the fold.   To this end, I am undertaking my own mission, albeit one of domestic concern. the game studio is waging war upon the spirits of the young with games such as these. I plan to attend the GenCon Game Fair, a gathering of role-playing cultists, pagans, Libertarians and heretics from around the world, to preach the Word directly and expose these dangerous fiends for what they are. Armed with my faith and a tract that puts forth the truth about role-playing and Demon in particular, I will turn White Wolf’s own war against it. Wish me luck, fellow disciples of God.   Pastor Ramos is no stranger to challenging the corruption The Game Studios Publishing makes its business. He has brought several actions against them in court and seeks to bring their crimes to the attention of the public at large. Taking a cue from the evangelical works of Jack Chick, Pastor Ramos has assembled the tract “Demonic Deviltry”, even employing the aid of one of The game studio's own artists who had seen through their morally cancerous ways. "    HONESTLY.

       so looks like my boss is closing the deal on vampire!  all he had to do was give up 200g of his fee with the studio but in return he gets first look on all properties that this company has, and thats well over 10 or so.  it's such a huge volume of work that we could make movies off of for years... if the audience is demanding them.  but i'm not going to celebrate until it's signed on the dotted line...but it's great because my boss doesn't really understand much of it, so i'll be pivitol in the creative development of these projects... after the deal closes we will begin looking for writers.. the bitches of the industry ;)  on the movie end... looks like our star has gotten pretty pissed with the director.  he called the writers yelling at them about the director not getting his shit together.. he wondered if we even had a director on this film.  the director replied "what's his problem" hahaha ... honestly.. who says that about a 50+ year veteran in this buisness?  but hopefully the director will get his head out of his gold-lined ass and start to work... he is already in the editing suite working on his previous film.. so once he is done with that he can concentrate on ours... let the nightmare begin.    great thing is though that it looks like Nov. 1 is going to be our start date.  We start building the sets in Prague next month.  We are building everything except for like one set, in the hotel.  going to be awesome!  i just listened to my boss and the producing partner of the director (boss and him are life long friends) bitch about the director.  it was pretty funny because here is this person that they know is just a total fuck up but they have to continue to kiss his ass in a way all because he is the director.  i need power like that.. but without the shitty rep ;)  i just got a copy of the new notes for the metrosexual romantic comedy we are working on.  they are pretty good.  the last version of the script made the main character seem really weak and pathetic.. so the studio execs are telling the writers to beef it up.  they are over in london so its all being done by email. we even get the scripts that way.  its amazing to see how this buisness works.  growing up and being an outsider it looked so easy.  an announcement is made on ET about a star or director doing a movie and a year later you are watching it.  but what they dont report on is all the writing and rewriting that goes into it.  all the fighting back and forth to try and get something accomplished.  we are all a team but disjointed and fighting to score at the same goal.  but hopefully with these new notes we will have  a better draft in a month or so and get on to securing talent (actors).  then we can find a director (this will be more a star vehicle.. the director wont matter so much, hell i could probably do it ) and get rolling into production.  but who knows when that will happen...    IN THE NEWS   they just decapitated another american... pretty sick... not so much the actual removal of the head.. but the fact that someone could actually be so evil that they can sit there and continually cut away through 7 inches or so of flesh and bone! thats not a soft chewey center there!     i just read about those four people that drowned in the pools at the water garden in ft worth.  thats pretty sad.  talk about a lawsuit waiting to happen.. i mean who leaves a 9 foot pool with powerful drains to be only guarded by a small sign that says no swimming.  put a fence up!  scientists announced today that they teleported properties from one atom to another. awesome.  looks like gene roddenbury was either from the future or an alien ;)  i'm hoping that this first flight of a privately owned and manned rocket into space is successful.  it will be the corner stone we need to ignite interest in space again.  most people think its just for the government so they don't care too much about it.. that and so that someone doesnt have to die ;)   3 MONTHS 28 DAYS TILL...   im 25.     REMEMBER?   The Cosmic Key from MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE (the He-Man movie)? The cosmic key was that device that when turned on it played music and created all the little shards of color and light and you had to push the right tones to open the dimensional gate?  Well, this is from Kabbalah... interesting...   Once upon a time . . .  a Thought created a Tone.  The tone created Keys of Light  The Keys of Light created Colors in Spectrum.  Sound, light, and color created patterns of geometry.  The patterns set up a 'Tree of Life' for a Cycle of Time.       No One Notices Area Man's Marginal Attempts  To Change MIDLAND, TX—No one in Jacob Grant's life has noticed his minor attempts to become a "more thoughtful and considerate person," the new-and-improved man reported Monday. "I'm just asking for a little recognition," said Grant, who in the past week purchased a pack of cigarettes for a friend, complimented his girlfriend's new haircut, and allowed his brother to eat the last samosa. "After all, it's not like I particularly enjoy holding elevator doors open." Despite the lack of positive feedback, Grant said he plans to give his new plan at least another day or two.

       so today i was informed that the earliest we could start principle photography (actually filming) is nov 8.  that sucks.  good news is, however, that we could enter preproduction as scheduled.  we are just waiting for the line producer (person who over sees the actual production during filming) to come up with a budget and get it approved by the studio.  that could take a couple of weeks.  but once that happens then the studio will give us $$$... so we wait some more....   some better news comes the way of the vampire deal... the studio has given a deadline of tomorrow for this deal to be made because it has taken so long for the owner and agent of vampire to come up with their deal.  they want an additional 250g on top of the 500g the studio is already willing to pay.  that's a huge amount of money for something that doesn't even have a script attatched to it!  but the studio doesn't want to give the extra 250g.  so my boss came up with a great solution:  if the agent and owner agree to give the studio final look (that means that if they want to take any of their properties to another studio and that studio makes an offer, then our studio has the right to make the same offer or beat it) on all of their properties, not just for vampire.    this is good because then our studio would essentially own every single property that the company has published and if other studios show interest in it, we can feed off that and it makes it easier for us to say "yes we will make this" because someone else is interested.  it's like having insurance.. you may spend a lot money for something you don't get immediate returns on, but one day you will need it and when you do you are glad you had it.  it's also the "if timmy wants it then i want it too" kinda thing...get it? got it? good.  so monday we should know more... my boss is going to hang out with the head of production for our studio to get him to give up the extra money so that we can "buy" all the properties.     RELATABLE LYRICS:    After years of expensive education, a car full of books and anticipation,  I’m an expert on Shakespeare and that’s a hell of a lot but the world don't need scholars as much as I thought.   Maybe I'll go travelling for a year, finding myself or start a career.  I could work for the poor though I’m hungry for fame we all seem so different but we're just the same.   Maybe I'll go to the gym, so I don't get fat,  are things more easy with a tight six pack?  Who knows the answers? Who do you trust?  I can't event separate love from lust.   Maybe I’ll move back home and pay off my loans,  working nine to five answering phones.  Don't make me live for my friday nights,  drinking eight pints and getting in fights.   I don't want to get up, just let me lie in, leave me alone, I'm a twenty something.   Maybe I'll just fall in love that could solve it all,  philosophers say that that’s enough,  there surely must be more. Ooooh  Love ain’t the answer nor is work,  the truth alludes me so much it hurts.  But I’m still having fun and I guess that's the key,  a twenty something and I'll keep being me.  I’m a twenty something.  Let me lie in, Leave me alone.  I’m a twenty something.   --Jaime Cullum   THINGS THAT PISSED ME OFF TODAY:   --the high and mighty united states postal service wouldn't take my boss' credit card to pay 8.84 for the 5 packages detailing his name and address which matched his buisness card and credit card to pay for mailing them.  but they would take a check that didnt have his name anywhere on it, just his buisness name, to pay for 74.00 worth of stamps.  --the parking attendant charged me 1.50 for 3 minutes into a 30min block of time.    LOOKS LIKE EVEN THE STARS SAY BIG THINGS ARE HAPPENING SOON:    What is happening in this month astrologically?  The Sun and the Moon are together in Virgo, the seventh house - the house of Libra. There is no doubt that there is a very serious closure of a chapter. A change is on its way. The astrological chart emphasizes the need for change, which means heading towards a new beginning.   Criticism is in the air, and there is a heightened ability to see what is wrong, what is not working in professional fields, as well as in the personal and marital life - there is a need for a thorough housecleaning - to look inside and see what needs to be changed.   Due to the cosmic pressure, there is an unusual need to take on new responsibilities that will result in year-long commitments in multiple fields Be open to new ideas and stay flexible. You will notice power plays and control issues at work and on personal fronts. Don’t feel threatened.

      so im sitting here at midnight listening to the roto rooter guy drive some long metallic flexible cord into my bathtub drain.  the upstairs neighbor bitched and moaned till they got a new bathtub and when they installed it, all the crap was washed down their drain and since we share one it clogged.  so since we are below them, when they shower it backs up into mine.. delicious.  so now after 4 days of trying to get someone here they have.  and now the upstairs neighbor is bitching bc it's loud and they can't sleep.  sweet sweet revenge.   UPDATE:    ***for the sake of this being posted on the net, i have to use discretion since i'll be talking about people other than myself.***   so from what i hear from the other assistant at the production office, looks like things will be moving along even more slowly.  my boss came back with not much news from prauge, atleast from what ive been told.  all he has said is that the director is acting like a typical american.  luckily tho, i was told today that the studio doesn't care much about the director's wishes anymore.    see here's the thing... the director has post production (editing and reshooting some scenes) to do on his last film, but because he would rather go play around in cannes and be a rich hollywood boy, he has neglected his responsibilites.  but when you are a rich brat you can get away with a lot.  luckily tho the studio is putting its foot down and saying that we are moving ahead with or without him.  the director will just have to work long weekends... so hopefully this will all be resolved sooner than later and i will get paid!     SOMETHING FUNNY:   today this indian mom and her son came into the store.  the mom wasnt that much over weight but she asked for hydroxycut.  i pulled a bottle for her to look at.  the son moved over to the little touch screen computer we have and played with it.  mind you the son is probably around 13 and bigger than his mom.  so she is asking questions and reading the bottle. im standing not even listening to her, waiting for her to just leave.  the son comes over and looks at the low-carb stuff behind her.  then she says "so this just has a lot of caffine?"  and i say "yes it..." but before i could finish, the indian son with big glasses and braces yells out "caffine! caffine! i need that!" and he  SNATCHES  the bottle out of his mother's hands and turns around back to the low-carb stuff.  i wanted to laugh so bad because it was so random, over dramatic, and out of the blue.  then he wouldnt give the bottle back to his mom.  he just horded it to himself. so i got her another one.    SOMETHING SPIRITUAL:   this fable concerns a man who was granted permission to visit both heaven and hell and returned to tell the tale...  "With and angel for his guide, the visitor is first ushered through the gates of Gehenom(Hell), which, he is suprised to find, are made of finely wrought gold.  The gates, in fact, are incomparably lovely, as is the verdant landscape that lies beyond them.  All this is quite astonishing to the visitor, who turns to his angelic guide in disbelief.  "It's all so beautiful," the man says. "The sight of the meadows and mountains... the sound of the birds singing in the trees... the scent of thousands of flowers..."  And then another scent catches his attention: the aroma of food being prepared.  The angel leads the visitor toward an immense banquet table laden with every sort of delicacy.  However, something is terribly wrong.  Hundreds of people are seated around the table, but they all appear to be starving.  Their emaciated condition is painful to see in the midst of such bount, but even worse is the frustration and anger they are obviously experiencing.  Each person at the table has a long-handled spoon chained to his wrist.  The handles are so long that no one can place food in his mouth.  But that does not prevent the condemmed souls from trying.  For all eternity, they are struggling to feed themselves a meal that is right before them, but that might as well be a hundred miles away.  Taken aback by the tragic spectacle, the visitor is now more than ready to visit Paradise, and the angel immediately complies.  At once they pass through another set of golden gates, alike in every detail to the gates of Hell. In fact, a great deal about the two locals seems to be identical, including the banquet table and the diners chained to their utensils.  But the people around this table are well-fed and happy, despite the fact that their circumstances are identical to those of the damned.  The difference is not in the physical situation, but in how they respond to it.  As you might have guessed by now, instead of trying to feed themselves, each of the souls at this table feeds the once across the table."  Brilliant!  well that's all for this edition of my life... stay tuned till next time...

      so my boss asked me what i want to do on the production today.  im not sure.  there are so many jobs that i cant think of one that i could do because i have no experience.    but then he posed this problem.  someone, experienced, needs to stay here and run the office.  if this person stays then they don't go to prauge.  but the trade off is that that person will be paid through out the production. those that go to prauge cant be garenteed that.    so its better for me to stay here because we have two things in development that i am part of and i would be paid more and longer, but then i forfit the experience of working on set and being over seas.  but my boss said i could come for a visit or something.  so i must decide.  the more logical is to stay here and make more money and work on the other projects.  but i need to get out of this office, damn!  but theni would be the boss here ;)  but then i lose prauge... hrmmmmm.. any advice?!
