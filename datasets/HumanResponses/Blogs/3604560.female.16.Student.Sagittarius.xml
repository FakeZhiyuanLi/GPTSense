      i think that this name would be more appropriate for me from now on because i doubt that i will be able to get on the computer very much anymore. that or the unreliable blog-person sounds like im a swamp monster anyway no poem im too tired - creative energy all leaked out sometime. i would leave a very deep and meaningful quote now but i cant remember one off the top of my head all i got is "why are you here?" "i love lollies" from the matrix catchas later WE DONT NEED NO STINKIN ENDING

      hello there  welcome to my insane world of err.. trichorder dont ask me what it means, but ive heard it twice so it must be real once on star trek:nemesis (the movie) you know that scene where data and the captain are on the desert planet with whatsisface and they find the evil data clone in all bits and pieces?  well the little doodad that data uses to home in on the bits is called a trichorder (or something that sounds like that) and scod said it once in a tripod song, but hes scod so he probably heard it same place as i did think its something to do with locating things based onn triangulation, and if ive lost half of your attention i apologise what else? well i did my blog on the other site first, giving them culture i am, and widening their horizons. any news is good news. so now ive sort of dried up of ideas.. theyll come to me later on today i bet tvtome is the best site ever for a tv addict like me.. seriously i think ill support the western bulldogs for the rest of the year and see where it takes me zheng.. im not smoking anything per se... passive smoking isnt real smoking is it? hehe i think i get high when my fingers come in contact with a computer keyborad and once my sis pisses off rite the poem... emm its coming hang on  rolling ever onwards towards a sky so grey where war and dusty famine surround us everyday i like to sit and wonder up at that big balloon that sits and waits and listens to me at every noon because i think that i am more stranger than you know more stranger than even i seem and this last senetnce has really wrecked the whole flow  longer than usual today but then i feel weirder than usual today say hi to your brothers and sisters for me au revoir (bet i spelt that wrong) FARSCAPE LIVES ON ps today i have new aunties i think one of them is only a coupla years older than me...

      a rant on the bestest band of all time - tripod should get an aria or something really they're the funniest ever so not too much else triple j on tuesdays is the best, even when the guys aren't in they play an old one, or they get rhys from playschool to do one of his random little bedtime stories deadbeat holiday will be fun once its up another little ditty: faraway and long ago a dinosaur sat on a cold igloo and while he waited for his tea a man came up and spoke to me and he said: watch out for the old pictures and smoke that rose from lion's head for when you look and do not see then you will be as blind as me  auf weidersehen

      TRIPOD – STOP PRETENDING YOU DON”T WANT ME  ADAM: It is time for Tripod’s Song-in-an-hour challenge. Wil, what have we set the boys from tripod this morning after last week’s tour-de-force? WIL: We want them to reveal their DJ names; we want a blatant cross promotion to their Comedy Festival show –  ADAM: They’ve got to fit it in like that “My Restaurant Rules” meets “Popstars” advertorial the other night. WIL: Exactly. We want um a mention of the fact that it was revealed today by an Australian scientist that it’s actually healthy to pick your nose and eat it. ADAM: Okay WIL: We want the slogan that was on the Westco T-shirts that they were trying to make their staff wear which said, “stop pretending you don’t want me”; and we want a mention of our favourite man of the moment, Craig Stevens, the guy denying Thorpie his gold medal.  TRIPOD:  Stop pretending you don’t want me,          when I know you do 	Stop pretending you don’t want me,          when I made it clear that I want you   GATESY:      You try to make me feel like I’m a second choice   YON & SCOD:  Ooooh…  GATESY:      Just cos your last boyfriend was disqualified 	    Well I’ll swim the race the best I can  YON & SCOD:  Ooooh…  GATESY:      You’d be so happy as my girlie 	    I’m not gonna jump too early  TRIPOD:      Like that other man 	                   I think you know what I mean 	     I think you know what I mean 	     I think you know what I mean 	      	      Stop pretending you don’t want me,               when I know you do 	     Stop pretending you don’t want me,               treating me like Pepe Le peu   GATESY:  I don’t know why you think that I’m no good  YON & SCOD:  Ooooh…  GATESY:  You think that I'm not “street", I'm not down with the hood  SCOD:  Well I got a posse, slash, a crew   GATESY: Who happened to be performing at the main town hall in the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. Four nights only, book at Ticketmaster. Tripod “3 Way Action” opens this Saturday. SCOD: Tripod, DJ crew, word off!	 YON: I’m DJ “lots of laughs”. GATESY: I’m DJ “clever songs with great harmonies” SCOD: I'm Vaudred the Avenger... GATESY: Scod, not your Dungeons and Dragons name, its your DJ name SCOD: Oh sorry… Okay, all right I'm DJ “merchandise in the foyer” YON: This song is no indication of quality of material in Tripod’s show “3 Way Action”.  TRIPOD:  Stop pretending          you don’t want me,           I'm eating well to stay in shape for you         Stop pretending   SCOD:    Ohh, stop pretending  TRIPOD:  You don’t want me 	I'm picking my nose and eating it         I don’t know what else I'm s’posed to do… 	I don’t know what else I'm s’posed to do… 	I don’t know what else I'm s’posed to do…   YON: Don’t say eat poo, don’t say eat poo please

      i cant think of anything else to write anymore so ill just be posting these from now on i think anyway: not as funny without the tune but you can get that off the triple j website        Tripod – city boy country values Adam: What have we set Tripod today as their song-in-an-hour challenge Wil? Wil: Well this is a tribute to Tamworth and the country music festival which is going on at the moment where the winner of the Shooting Star Award described himself as a city boy raised with country ethics, so we want a song about a city boy raised with country ethics. Adam: Hmmmm…. Wil: Could we also have mention of the Channel Ten blue dot, which we’re pushing for best new talent at this year’s Logies… Adam: You bet we are! Wil: And we said could there be a flash flood. That’s right a flash flood at some point. Adam: And we want someone to suffer from Anal Drover Ear, a medical condition that obsessive-compulsive sheep farmers get if they go swimming. Tripod, best of luck, its eight to eight, take it away!  Tripod:    Oh mamma…  Scod:      I got a yearning in my soul  Tripod:    Oh mamma…  Scod:      I can’t fill this empty hole  Tripod:    I always shut the gate 	  And I never turn up late 	  And I call everybody “mate” 	  Including you mum 	  I don’t know what I’m supposed to do mum  Scod:      Cos I still don’t feel like this is where I’m from.   Tripod:    Oh mamma… 	  Why do I like spicy food? 	  Oh mamma… 	  Instead of “mate” I wanna call you “dude”  Gatesy:    I was raised a country boy 	  So why do I like soy milk? 	  And instant coffee always makes me gag  Tripod:    Instead of stubbies I want to wear JAG 	    And even Father John calls me a fag  Yon: Well son, I guess its time to tell you  Tripod:    In the flash flood  Yon:       Of eighty-three son,   Tripod:    You…  Yon:       Were brought to me son.  Scod:      You were shipwrecked out of Tamworth and your family was lost  Tripod:    And I raised you as my own  	  Like a monkey raised Tarzan   Gatesy: That makes so much sense mum. Somehow I’ve always known  Tripod:    Oh mamma… 	  So that’s why I never felt at home 	  Oh mamma… 	  I wanna bust a rhyme on a microphone  Gatesy: Off the top of my dome, off the top of my dome Tripod:    And I won’t shed a tear 	  Take the first bus out of here 	  Gonna start a hip-hop act called Anal Drover Ear 	  We’ll be rapping country values for my career  Scod:      And I’ll be on Channel Ten within a year…  Tripod: “Click!”  Tripod:     Oh mamma… 	    I’ve got a yearning in my soul…

      Time for my lazy fingers (actually just 5 outta 10 coz i only type with 5 fingers anyways) to get off their lazy arses and write something. That was the extent of my thought. Just watched The Day After Tomorrow today. It was GOOD! Ian Holm was in it! I love how Americans become illegal aliens in MEXICO! And their stupid money amd Americanism and their stupid stuck-up, we're-better-than-everyone-else-'tude can't save them from the ice-age. Bring on Fahrenheit 9/11! (Was that spelt right? Mel? That's your area of expertise). Anyone gonna see Spiderman 2? Anyone wanna see it with me during the holidays? I promise I won't talk during the film (much). Huh...that took time. And effort. I never realized that being a part of a blog meant actual participation...until now...  As they say, "When in Middle-Earth, do as Middle-Earthians (Middle-Earthlings?) do...  Namárië

      Since mel is complaining so much about being the only one online (Mel - online - it sounds wrong, I know) I will say stuff also. My bro made me bookmark the tripod site cos he thinks they're cool and they like the stuff he likes: tron, d&d, being nerdy... Who is this OC person? How do you guys find so much time to watch tv? As in tv that is not wholesome and good like Dr Who and the one with Harris Pembleton thats name I don't recall. I literally failed today's maths common. I am tired, and my nose is cold.

Anyway, the beetles that i will be studying originated from egypt hence the exotic-ness of them. They actually look really ugly. he sent me info on it and yep it's really ugly. it's not colourful or anything - just black :( anyway if this blog could show pics i'll stick on here but if u guys really wanna kno what they look like go here: http://sgrl.csiro.au/storage/insects/beetles_moths/Egyptian_beetle.html  yes, its ugly isn't it...oh well...at least its not dangerous. i kno it says it spit out icky stuff when threatened but the guy sed that he has NEVER seen it do that so...i'll be the judge of that later eh?

      Hello all. Don't be afraid, I don't bite.  After much annoyingness related to strange invites that do not want to work, I am in. Does everyone/anyone have a link on their Dashboard page that says Edit Profile? According to Blogger Help I do, but I don't. I want to change my name, which will probably show up here as arden toryn lyn or some such. Since I don't really have to continue the alias here, I may as well call myself Eilatan. Or some such...  Wow, Mel knows trichorders. Yes, they are portable scanning devices on Star Trek. No, Jake 2.0 wasn't on; right before it was due to start, there was a notice saying it wasn't going to be on that night due to Miriam moving into the Big Brother house. Because Channel 10 is renowned for its customer service...  If I don't show up here often, I'm probably at my Live Journal, so go there, or just bug me lots. Or don't bug me...  toodles natbat kersplat  P.S. What part of the alphabet would look like if there was no Q and R. P.P.S. Yes, I am a stickler for grammar/spelling. You can write that way if you like, but I am uptight. Leave me be.

There was like a whole day of cable dedicated to the dude, you can tell he was an actor because the funeral was huge, with all the trimmings. I have honestly realized that the greatest amount of pollution this year will have come from the like 10 minute gun salute they had for him,.. i mean really was all that smoke necessary? sorry, like no disrespect to the dead and all but what a huge waste of money, and should i stop now, i don't think this site was for me venting my opinions  good day everyone,  FARSCAPE LIVES ON

      Hi again...I didn't know that I was supposed to post the first time so I did the only thing I'm good at...I blabbed. This is Mary by the way. You probably can't tell because I have a Lord of the Rings-related name. That's my obssession and there are 11 other people on this blog (or will be eventually) will attest to this. And Tina? HARRY POTTER IN 1 1/2 DAYS! I absolutely can't wait! It's going to be good, I can tell. If not, I'm still gonna buy the DVD when it comes out coz that's what I do. I have sets and they must be complete or else I go crazy trying to complete them. 6 Months until Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Extended Edition Collector's Box Set comes out! Phew, thats a type-full (since it didn't involve me saying it). Anyways...toodles until after I've seen the Prisoner ot Azkaban!

      Hmmm...the blogging is lagging. Who woulda thought we'd just slowly forget we have a blog?  Tina, you don't have to strip anymore, we're playing good ol' *chess*. I reckon strip poker woulda been funnier, but the rules say the movie has to be PG or G rated (*stupid school rules*).  I just saw Charmed. CHRIS DIES? [:'(] ... he was cute even when he was dying, and baby Chris is cute too...actually, baby Wyatt is growing on me...he's adorable when he orbs.  Well, last week I discovered why Colin Firth is so handsome and this week, it's Ioan Gruffudd ... wow ... the cuteness when he smiles! Yes Natbat, I know you saw him first, and I know I caught onto Ioan craze a little later than everyone else (delayed reaction), but better late than never! And I watched him on Rove and didn't tape it! Anyone got a copy so I can watch with new admiration?  Alright, finally, we hav a filming date and it will begin on the 5th of August, between, 8:30 and 8:45 am (I can't guarantee that I am capable of getting to school at 8:30am). Fingers crossed it will work and no interruptions! Ooh, that reminds me, I still have to write a formal script of some kind ... well, to work then ...   Namárië

Oh man....i so can't wait tonight i know it is only 1hr and 25mins to go but i really like REALLY can't wait......this will be my last perve on Chris *sobs*     anyway, mary is making a short film - hurrah - and i am so not going to play - or even pretend - to strip for mel *I AM STRAIGHT MAN!!!!!* so thumbs up for any other game idea u hav in mind....     well, that is all i have on my mind right now....i have to go back to practise my ditzy look - oh wait...i don't really need to practise huh? i think i already do look like a ditz - oh wait maybe i am a ditz? am i a ditz? hmmm......

Alcron: THING   Alcaron: someTHING!  or   serluny: how long did it took u to learn c?  ReDPriest:4.5 minutes  serluny:how did u do that?

       Hey everybody! I'm here to ramble for a few mo coz I got nothing better to do.  Ooh, our next door neighbours are watching Star Wars Ep VI...I'm so proud that I can recognise it from just the music! I know what you're thinking ... *freak* right? Wrong! I'm not just a freak...I'm a (semi-)obssessed freak! (Fully obssessed would be when I own a lightsabre replica, which will be when I have enough money).    Speaking of merchandice, unofficial pics of The Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King Extended Edition DVD Collector's Box Set Miniature Minas Tirith Sculpture looks sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool! And I for one will happily dish out 150&nbsp;odd bucks for it come December...and if the release day falls on a school day, you guys might all have to put up with me staring adoringly at the box alllllllllllllllllllllll day long.    *Sigh* can't wait! I'm going on a (relatively big, for me)&nbsp;DVD binge. Of course, I might have to find ways to&nbsp;get some of&nbsp;them in the mail without my parents knowing. Anyone have any ideas?    Mel, Farscape DVD is only a few clicks away, so tell me when to click!     Well, I've gushed on for long enough...    Ciao bellas    Namárië

Moving on... yes.. that was a relief... TAMARA... no wonder i couldn't think of it.. its very random. I declare that i am a good driver... "HEY YOU THERE, STOP LAUGHING" *wait until i get out of this room and run over you brains* i went on another drive around the block... it took me half an hour, nevertheless, i made it safely around without killing anything *that wasn't worth killing*.   see you hotties... mwa&nbsp;&nbsp;      urlLink    &nbsp;   urlLink        &nbsp;         urlLink

      Uh oh, school soon =( I haven't done any work (not that that's unusual for me) but there's still so much that I was meant to do. Okay, so according to Tina I owe you guys a bday list, though is it just me or did Tina seem drunk whilst typing her post? =P I went through the shops this week and OMG I dunno what I want =S I hate it when that happens cos I know as soon as my bday is over, I'll finally know what I want but it'll be too late by then. So I guess just get me anything except clothing, stationary, earrings (duh), bags, and anything else I wouldn't want LOL Yep, that should narrow it down for you all =P Hmmm...sorry, not doing a very good job, but I guess I have been hanging out in the electronics department lately cos of all my babysitting and playing those demo games on Xbox and PS2, and I've been looking at lotsa cds and dvds. Nothing picked out though LOL Just pick something, I don't mind, and if you're stuck, just get a shopping voucher so when I know what I want, I can still get it. Does that help at all? =S Anyways, I guess I'll just leave you all to it.  I watched Pride and Prejudice videos today. It's actually not too bad compared to the book, wished it had subtitles like on DVDs but nonetheless, I managed =D Still contemplating whether or not to read through the book cos I haven't touched it at all this holidays and there's not much left. Anyways, I have to get back to my psychology and business studies assignment crap. Cheerio!

      I just watched ABC (yes Mel, I do occasionally flick to ABC sometimes) and discovered that Pride and Prejudice, the original BBC series with Colin Firth (*sigh*) will be airing again soon! Yay! It seems like perfect timing that they should repeat it just when we're doing the book in English.  Watched King Arthur today. The story is very different, no magic, nothing supernatural (ie. no lady in the lake with excalibur [sp?]) I can see a little of why people think Ioan is cute, but the beard was very off-putting (nothing like Aragorn, who looks really weird without a beard)  Well, that's it.  &nbsp;  Ciao  &nbsp;  Namárië

      I love Mr Darcy! I love Colin Firth! Go BBC! By the way, I challenge any of you (aside from Zheng who has probably memorised the whole book by now) to find who said that quote and about whom. Mary, you would probably like  Spaceballs , I know I would. So if you get it, lend it to me, will ya?  Men in Tights  is good also. Tina, Ioan is about 30, or was last I checked, so he might be 31 or 32 now. I'm a member of one of his fan sites. I got an acceptance email about it the other day... After  three months . I'd completely forgotten. I stayed up til past one last night reading  Pride and Prejudice , then watched 5 hours of it today! I love Colin Firth! He's  so  wonderful! Everybody, watch BBC version of P&P, cos it is  so cool !  Happy rest of hols Don't do schoolwork! Toodles

      Hi all. I'm back for a few mo. Well, went to Wollongong last weekend. Of course, the normal rules of going away apply: it would rain (hard) on the one day we decide to go away after virtually MONTHS of fine weather. I woke up at 5:30am to watch the sunrise and the @#%$#@# CLOUDS COVERED EVERYTHING! UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *Sigh* well, you can't have everything, I guess.  The amazing thing about being home alone during the holidays is that you learn something new everyday. Like yesterday, I learned not to put a half-cooked egg in the microwave. Because it will explode. And not to put soy sauce in with the egg. Becuase it will explode SPECTACULARLY. Good thing I managed to clean up.  Tina, 10:15am it is. Meet at Central? Platform or outside? You know there are two ends so get on the 4th door from the end (or second last carriage) to get the escalators closest to the exit that goes to Broadway. Don't ask how I derived to that place. Did that sentence make any sense at all? Mel will have an opinionated answer, won't you? I have a system of boarding trains at particular carriages depending on the destination station, but that's starting to sound like a boring topic so I'll stop now... Divz, 3 weeks till Roswell comes out on DVD here! I can't wait! Marti, are you 17 yet? If you are...*sheepishly* Happy Birthday! Where did the word "sheepish" come from anyway? How does the act of being sheepish look anything like a sheep?  Hey Zheng, congrats. Although, pedestrians of the world beware. Natbat, do ya reckon it would be worth it to buy Spaceballs (sp?) on DVD for $15? Or should I get Robin Hood: Men In Tights instead? Do you reckon I'd like Spaceballs? Went to Beauty and the Beast On Ice last night. Wow! I know, I know, it's not for my age group, but still, it was really good. Some good skating! And the best bit of all was at the end of the show, this amazingly romantic guy proiposed to his girlfriend in front of the packed Superdome audience! They had a spotlight and gave him a microphone and he was so humble and it was really cool and the whole stadium all cheered and 'awwwww'-ed and she said yes! (She woulda gotten such a dissing from the crowd if she said no!) Well, toodles for now If I don't check in again, see ya at school! I'm trying to sound excited even though I've no virtually no work. Halfway through Pride and Prjudice though, Yay me!  Namárië

      I knew there was a problem keeping about a million online journals, I can't seem to decide where to post anymore, my brain can't take the stress and besides, according to that Life Expectancy Test, if I continue the way I'm going, I'm gonna live to 90.6 But holy crap, why would I wanna live to such an old age where I'd be all fat and wrinkly and unable to chew my own food. Gross.   Good on ya Div, I love Pay It Forward, even if Mel disagrees. And it's Tamara who's going out with Kyle =D See? I listen to 2dayfm hehehe And congrats to Zheng for getting her L's. I've decided not to get my L's simply cos of 2 reasons. My mom and dad both don't wanna take me out in their "pretty new" cars just in case I scratch it or something and I just can't be bothered to read the book or do those online test thingys. Besides, I'm sure we've got enough drivers in our group - but is there anyone who is actually safe enough to get in the same car as???  I'm still stuck on Pride and Prejudice. Actually, I haven't touched it at all hehehe oops. I think I'll just watch the video and that's it. I tried to rent it but all the copies are out =( But I did rent Cheaper By The Dozen, Chasing Liberty, Enough, Insomnia, Along Came Polly, Love Actually, 8 Mile, I Am Sam, The Man Who Sued God and Shrek 2 (shh, it's pirate). And Mel, you may NOT comment on those video choices.   I went ice skating at Macquarie the other day. It was like fully packed and towards the end, the ice was like fully melting and so the middle was like an island. My friend won the limbo thing and got this lunchbox cooler. It was like soooo low that I don't think majority of us would have fit even lying face down in the ice. But then again, he was only 9. Oh, and I didn't fall once =D Pretty good effort considering it was only my second time ice skating, and I even helped some little kids who were crying cos they couldn't skate without falling. How cute =P  Anyways, I think I'll just do one of those random post thingys every so often =P But if you're bored, you can visit my other journal www.livejournal.com/users/martinaho Cheers!

I kinda like it better than the books actually - not that i hav anything against it. it was easier to digest. if u guys get a hand on the DVD i definitely recommened u guys to check it out.   ok...whose fighting for ioan? this is very interesting considering that he is far far away and ... how old is he? i shall take divs stride and sit back and watch mel and nat fight over him. lol. very funny. i'll just hog my chris :) yes mary he is mine!   stupid big brother! took over charmed last week. for dog's sake who cares about bree re-entering and stuff can't they do it after charmed. anyways my comp is stuffing up - mary can i borrow ur virus update thing?   by-e!

      Mel, for your information, I've been watching Hornblower for several  years  now, so I highly doubt you found him first. So  there . Yes, I have the p&p videos. I must've watched them about 6 times. Bout 6 hours long. Zheng, did you seriously read the book  4 times ? You are so brave... or bored... or insane... Still done  no  schoolwork/homework  at all . I am  so  gonna die. But die happy, as I haven't been doing work! :) Um... reading  Fire from Heaven  by Mary Renault. It's  so  good, but Haphaestion is  so sad ! He's so self-sacrificing and never gets what he wants. I think I'm gonna cry... Dad bought a book that has summaries of every classic book ever written:  Tess of the d'Urbervilles  in 15 pages! I prolly won't even read  that , but anywho. Too many books, I can't fit them on my shelf, let alone  read  them all! The agony! Congrats Zheng on the L's-getting. I would take a ride with you, but my parents would probably forbid me, especially after you told my dad about how you drove with the  handbrake on . Oh, well. I am tired, and my eye hurts, and my fingers are cold. Oh, yeah, I watched Spidey 2 yesterday! It was really good. I thought it would be crap, cos most sequels are... Main thing that bugged me was that Dr Ock seemed impervious to Spiderman's punches. He has mechanical arms, that  doesn't  make him superhuman! Anywho.  Nightie-night, sweethearts Don't miss me too much, I know it hurts, but we'll see each other again in *counts on fingers* seven days. bubye

      I did that obviously to prove a point!!!! I purposefully didn't explain that part of the joke so that, you could see that when i don't explain the joke, you guys don't get it or u miss out on crucial parts of the joke like that for instance!!!!  Ok everyone but Mel read on - I can't believe i worte JI..It's weird...coz i kept saying GI out aloud(and at the same time laughing at my lameo joke and how it would make all of u cringe)..yet i still wrote GI....i think i wrote JI coz the "J" matched the one in "Jane"...and it looked pretty.....  Mel u can read now - i think i'm over Ioan - it was fun while it lasted, he's cute but he don't cut it for me anymore....i'll always remember him and our time together....he's still cute but i see so very less of him nowadays and i feel we are growing apart....however it will be fun to watch you guys fight over him like mad animals - i'll be a spectator for a change!!!

      Ok Zheng - i've had it....the number of sites i've had to look up to find that scandal'us chick - it's driving me crazy - But this is what i've got so far: I can give you names and descriptions, Zheng, but i still don't know which one's dating Kyle (for those who don't know, this is kyle from Hot 30)  Firstly - there's Anne - she has got dead straight long black hair - like up to her waist or something Daneila - has short straight black hair (like up to her neck - but shorter) Lastly, Tamara - she's the curly hairded one - with red or orange or auburn (or whatever colour that is) streaks  Sorry (to the rest of you) to remind you of the worst band ever - But Zheng sent me on a mission, and I, J.I Divya (ehhe - did u notice the play of words - you see instead of J.I Jane i used my name..Lol)needed to complete this mission to prove myself and my  strengths - which i did, because girls, i came out alive - do u think u could??? Coz we're talking scandal'us here!!!  Anyway, I watched "pay it forward" and it's really gooooodddd!!! I did the life expectancy test while watching cast away - i'm gauranteed to live over 65 - (i missed some of the questions so i don't know for sure)...i don't think that show was good for those planning to end their lives early..hmmm  Guys i want to warn you about Zheng's driving!!! - She's not like Mary who likes to drive at 20 km/h (btw, Mary there's nothing wrong with that - safe speeding all the way!!!) and she's not like Marija, who would drag race with any stranger just so that she would feel like she was on the fast and the Furious with her Vinny  Zheng's a case of her own - she prefers to drive over small children and fluffy animal - she seeks danger!!!  But if ur a thrill seeker like me - (i like to steal science equipment and homework) then join Zheng in her aim to wreek havoc on the streets of Kogarah - coz i'm a joiner!!!  Ok, Nat, there's no use fighting over Ioan - let's just ask Ioan who he wants to be with ok?  may the better georgie win!! And Tina - u were very immature about his tongue, but i forgive you, for u are just a mere mortal amongst powerful, graceful, chocoholic immortals like myself and Ioan  do u not realise his tongue is the cause of divine intervention!!!  Anyway, my bubbly budds (alliteration!!!!) I'm outta here

      look the girl in charge of the tripod lyrics site is too busy nowadays apparently she has to prioritise and tripod lost out anyway i was going into withdrawal so im posting this and you cant do anything about it not as funny without the tune but you can get that off the triple j website        Tripod – city boy country values Adam: What have we set Tripod today as their song-in-an-hour challenge Wil? Wil: Well this is a tribute to Tamworth and the country music festival which is going on at the moment where the winner of the Shooting Star Award described himself as a city boy raised with country ethics, so we want a song about a city boy raised with country ethics. Adam: Hmmmm…. Wil: Could we also have mention of the Channel Ten blue dot, which we’re pushing for best new talent at this year’s Logies… Adam: You bet we are! Wil: And we said could there be a flash flood. That’s right a flash flood at some point. Adam: And we want someone to suffer from Anal Drover Ear, a medical condition that obsessive-compulsive sheep farmers get if they go swimming. Tripod, best of luck, its eight to eight, take it away!  Tripod:    Oh mamma…  Scod:      I got a yearning in my soul  Tripod:    Oh mamma…  Scod:      I can’t fill this empty hole  Tripod:    I always shut the gate 	  And I never turn up late 	  And I call everybody “mate” 	  Including you mum 	  I don’t know what I’m supposed to do mum  Scod:      Cos I still don’t feel like this is where I’m from.   Tripod:    Oh mamma… 	  Why do I like spicy food? 	  Oh mamma… 	  Instead of “mate” I wanna call you “dude”  Gatesy:    I was raised a country boy 	  So why do I like soy milk? 	  And instant coffee always makes me gag  Tripod:    Instead of stubbies I want to wear JAG 	    And even Father John calls me a fag  Yon: Well son, I guess its time to tell you  Tripod:    In the flash flood  Yon:       Of eighty-three son,   Tripod:    You…  Yon:       Were brought to me son.  Scod:      You were shipwrecked out of Tamworth and your family was lost  Tripod:    And I raised you as my own  	  Like a monkey raised Tarzan   Gatesy: That makes so much sense mum. Somehow I’ve always known  Tripod:    Oh mamma… 	  So that’s why I never felt at home 	  Oh mamma… 	  I wanna bust a rhyme on a microphone  Gatesy: Off the top of my dome, off the top of my dome Tripod:    And I won’t shed a tear 	  Take the first bus out of here 	  Gonna start a hip-hop act called Anal Drover Ear 	  We’ll be rapping country values for my career  Scod:      And I’ll be on Channel Ten within a year…  Tripod: “Click!”  Tripod:     Oh mamma… 	    I’ve got a yearning in my soul…

      Divya, Dr Who is not a disease, it's a lifestyle, and it's hardly dangerous, so don't worry 'bout your mum. Good to hear your finger is well. I don't care how fantastic Tarantino is, Kill Bill was a flop, and for good reason. You're not marrying Ioan, I'll make sure of it.  Yay! Who won State of Origin? WE DID! And was Freddie fantastic or was Freddie fantastic? Fitzy was good too, but I had this annoying guy behind me who kept whinging about Minichiello all through the first half, and then in the second when Minichiello was getting really good he's like saying that he was just starting to redeem himself. I'd like to see him try, that 60-year-old loser...  Mel, I think they were prolly just called 'random-hard-rolled-oats-goldensyrup-and-coconut-biscuits' or something. I got this from the Australian War Memorial site:  "The army biscuit, also known as an ANZAC Wafer or an ANZAC Tile, is essentially a hardtack biscuit, a long shelf-life biscuit substitute for bread. Unlike bread though, the biscuits are very, very hard. Some soldiers preferred to grind them up and use them as porridge. (Add water and sugar, cook, serve with generous dollop of jam.)"  Hey doobies, got to:  urlLink PROGRAMAS MSN THINGY . Don't worry that it's not in English, you don't need words except the ones on the program thing. It makes goofy avatar pics. I don't know if you can save them or something, I just go Printsrceen and cut it to the site I want in Paint. Anyways, it's cool. There's also one that makes emoticons, but they're not as cool. It's the link up top on the left that says 'Creacion Emoticons'. See, I know another language!  Nyergh. Nearly the end of the first week of holidays and I've done none of my homework. Typical.  Divz: "I know never to play with fire again but only fire that resides in the hearts of my many male lovers!!!!" Nyerny?  Toodles

      Gonna see the Lion King show tonight. Just to let you know. I'm really excited now. LIKE REALLY EXCITED! And going to Wooooooooooooooolloooooooongooooong tomorrow! I'm exaggerating the word so no one can correct me (its MEANT to have lots of o's)   Natbat, Kill Bill 2 is supposed to be less violent than vol 1; people say its waaaaaaaay less violent than Passion of the Christ but they gave it a higher rating anyway...:(  How's everyone's holidays going so far? 5 1/2 days down...11 1/2 days to go. (FYI I'm counting the weekend of the last week of school so don't correct me about how many days we've got. If you do I'll post a post with just the word phallus and nothing else....hehehe "post a post" Oh I crack myself up sometimes (to put it in an American way)  Ooooh I just watched 11'9"01. In case you didn't know it's a combo of 11 short films by 11 different directors from 11 different countries, each bit lasting 11 min, 9 sec and 1 frame. I know its really pushing it but some of it was really sad and really well done. 2 outta the 11 were in English so subtitle's galour. Sean Penn was the American one. It was pretty cool. The Jap one I really saw no relevance to New York but other than that the rest were pretty arts-y.   Tina, when do ya wanna see King Arthur? And where? Lemme know will ya?

      Or at least not my sister's (younger sis Erin is having a 'movie marathon' with her friends; mum says if she keeps us up like last time, she'll never have another sleepover again). Kill Bill was very disappointing, I liked Zatoichi heaps though. I guess I'll have to watch Kill Bill 2 to see the rest. Mick (bro) said it was going to be heaps violent, but it wasn't all that bad, though that could just be my desensitised brain talking. Nathan Foley - is he from Hi 5? Tina, don't stress, we all have work too, we just don't bring our stresses to our blogs (at least not this blog). Calm down. What sort of dog did you have in mind for your...

Anyway i met someone famous too! Ok...he's not THAT famous......ok...he's not famous at all...i saw Mr Allum shopping....*gasps*...*chokes*...hehe...he was wearing the funny caps he always wears at the carnivals....oh...i'm not sure if he wore the long socks too, it was hard to tell considering the fact that he was wearing long pants - and i hav no intentions of pulling his pants down to find out (i would say pulling his pants up but i think they were high enough already LOL)! And guess who else he was hanging around???...No it wasn't Mrs Hodge or Mrs Sharp or Mrs Field - it was a different lady! I'm pretty sure it wasn't his mum...i think...unless his mum conceived him when she was pretty young....ok...i do not want to think about how Mr Allum was conceived...ARGH...  i better go before i say something that i will regret..  potato pie  ARGH!

      Don't you just hate it when you know the perfect word to describe something but that words continues to elude you...its on the tip of your tongue and you just can't think of it? Well, that's been happening to me for about 12 hrs. What's the formal word for anal? Please help me. It's been bugging me for half a day and will continue to do so for a while.   And Divz. Who? I have never heard of that guy. Where did you meet him? Is he on a kiddies' show? coz those shows are frightening. Did you know that Emilie de Ravin a.k.a. Tess Harding was on as episode of NSIC? She was an Aussie chic sun-bathing on a boat. It was pretty cool coz she didn't have that fake American accent. This was a while back though, I forgot to tell you, but now I have. So there you go. How do you burn your finger from lighting a candle? Where you trying to put it out with your fingers, coz you shoulda licked them or dipped them in water first. Otherwise you'll burn them. Not that I know from personal experience coz I'M NOT ALLOWED TO BURN CANDLES ANYWHERE OTHER THAN THE KITCHEN (which defeats the purpose of having an candles for aromatherapy in my room)  Okay, I've rambled on for long enough. Maybe I should start my own blog so I can ramble some more. But that involves logging on two sites. Can't be stuffed.  Namárië

BTW, tina i am forever grateful for the everlasting image of you and a dog making love that is now imprinted in my head!!!!  I burnt my finger trying to light a candle - i've been trying to convince my mum, it's a frist-degree burn and needs urgent medical attention!!!! It's not my fault if i won't be able to write for the rest of my life (don't ask how i typed this blog - u'll wreck my story)  Anyway, i know ur all wondering what the title's all about.... well i met someone very special! He's male..(that says it all)..a good dancer, on channel 9 every weekday, can sing and has a gorgeous smile!!!! If you guessed Tim Harding, you're so wrong and so far from the truth  It was Nathan Foley!!! I got his signature - and he smiled this killer smile - i'll never forget that moment - i think we saw into each other's soul I know it's quite hard to sink in - but it'll hit you soon guys, is Shrek 2 better than 1?  Take care, and if ur name is Tina, stay away from dogs!  I love Brando!

      How was Kill Bill Natbat? Do ya reckon I'd like it?  I can use what ever word I want to describe whatever I want...so THERE! >:P (that was meant to be an evil-stick-tongue-out-face btw) My username on HPANA is Saira Mavoinë but I haven't posted anything yet so you prolly wont find me. I went back to check it and it's meaning is something along the lines of "wisdom; yearning" which is close enough. But one word is Sindarin and the other is Quenya (can't be bothered to correct it).  Thanks for the spelling tip. I would have never known and may have lived the rest of my life spelling it this wrong-ish way. ;)   Marti, what do you want for your birthday? I'm at a loss. Dunno what to get you. And don't say I dont know/I don't care coz I'm just gonna keep buggin' ya.  Namárië

      Hihi Mary, do not use the word phallus to describe holidays... or anything. Just don't. Watched Zatoichi and Kill Bill (1) last night, so I went to bed around 1.20. Woken up by doorbell at 7.15. Grrrr. Tired. Mary, what did you say your HPANA name was? Wollongong - not like 'wool'.  rock on

      It might seem like a great holiday, but with all the stuff due RIGHT after it, its about as long as a phallus before puberty. That's not very long in case you didn't kown. I refrained from using the other word for phallus coz this sounds so much less rude...dunno why.   Anyways, what a nice way to start of the holidays. I was so bored yesterday I read the INSTRUCTION MANUAL FOR MY CAMERA. And it turns out there are soooooooooooooo many cool special features I can use. I can fade into a scene or make an 'old movie' style movie or film in pastel colours, which is really cool and retro. Can't wait to start putting you guys on film (or in my case, DVD)!!! Keep thinking 'bout what you guys wanna do coz there are heaps of possibilities (though limited by film-ability) Evelyn, when's the pancake day out? Hopefully not this weekend coz I'll be in Woollongong (sp?).   So Long Fairwell Auf Wiedersen Goodbye  Namárië

      Hey guys, Mel that's so cool that ur getting a new phone - but it's also sad - i know how attached you were to it. i'll never forget bricky (i've named our phone, i mean your phone) - oh how it would always make its way back to you , mel...it really did love you! Anyway onto newer and better things...i saw the esikmo joe video clip as well - it's so gooooooood...i'm seriously going crazy over the lead - i mean his mouth is just so tantilizing (if that is how u spell it). I didn't see the 1200 techniques one though :( Has anyone seen that funny song about a meatshake? Yes i did mean to write meatshake and not milkshake!  Mud, I'm thinking of mud!
