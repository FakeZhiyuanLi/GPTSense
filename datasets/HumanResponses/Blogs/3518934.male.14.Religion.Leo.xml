Talked on the phone for a while with the only person i ever talk to, aka my love interst Toni. im  SUPPOSED  to go to her house tommorow god i  really  hope i get to, well if youve ever read any of these "post" things you know that im obsessed with her and miss her if i dont get to see her all the time. but its alright if i dont get to see her tommorow (witch i better be able to)but if i dont get to then i get to see her sunday cuase im supposed to go to church with her lol nice right?. but its like 7:10 right now so im gonna go seeing how she was supposed to call like 40 minutes ago. o well it happens i guess. but im must be goin, later
