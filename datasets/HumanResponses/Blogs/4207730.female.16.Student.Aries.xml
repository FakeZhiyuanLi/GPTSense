      Today I woke up and went back over to the mall to go shopping...I didn't find anything, but I got a pretty necklace and hair clips from Anchor Blue. While I was there I saw Nicole and PHil...haha, its always funny how I catch them in Anchor Blue!  While I was at the mall ALyssa text messaged me and said "kyle was in the paper"...I was like wtf? Yeah so they were talking about his group getting ambushed in Iraq and how it all happened. Gosh, it was sad. I wish they didn't bring it up again, but I'm also happy they did because it shows that hes NEVER FORGOTTEN.

      Alright lets back some things up a little bit...Friday I went to get my nails done with Alyssa, we both got acrylic nails. OMG theyre soo cute on us. I chilled at her house for a bit, then we called Nicole up to ask if she wanted to come with us to Target, but plans didn't work out. At around 4 I came home because I had to finish some stuff and then go over to my uncle's house for dinner. After dinner I went to Hacienda with  my mom and aunt, we sat and talked at Starbucks.   Saterday-I woke up at 12:40,lol. ANd at 1 PM Ashley called and we went to the mall, she had to leave early because she had to go to a Wedding Shower. SO I caught up with my mom and walked around with her for like 2 hrs. I got Ralph Lauren perfume at Sephora it smells good and 2 pairs of jeans...damn has anyone else noticed that lately the jeans have been lose fitted? They arent like tight anymore! I hate lose jeans! They make me look fat. My mom thinks that its because more girls these days are fat and they can't fit into hip huggers. well i say...SCREW THEM! I HATE FAT PEOPLE THEY'RE A DISGRACE TO THIS SOCIETY,lol. They should just keep making hip huggers and make PLUS sizes for all the fat people. I hate when fat bitches try on size 3 pants...they stretch them out and then they dont end up getting them because they're too damn small!...Well duh...I coulda told them that before they tried them on!Its liek they need to feel skinny or something. whatever. sorry i had to vent.  I went out to dinner with my mom and thats about it.

      Today was so much fun! At around 10:30 Alyssa and I headed to the salon to get our nails done. First we went to eat lunch at Togos and then I went to get acrylic nails. Alyssa didn't wanna do it at first because she said she was flat out  broke(it happens when you're a teenager,lol) So she watched. After that we went back to her house it waas like around 12:30. Sat around watched a little bit of American wedding...we got antsy and couldn't sit still. We called Nicole to see if she wanted to come shopping, but she didn't have a car to drive. So screw that idea,lol.  Alyssa then decided that she wanted to get her nails done, so we scounged around the house for money FINALLY i got Jordan(alyssa's sister) to lend her some $$. And we go over to Lana's nails to get it done...they charged her more,but they look cute. WHile she was doing that I got my eye brows waxed and wow theyre thin, but oh welll. As I was paying the lady, I noticed that I had money that was missing from my wallet, it just didn't feel right, so I told Alyssa about it. Seconds later Alyssa's sister's friend's mom called ALyssa and was like "did u give crystal money because she said u did" and Alyssa said no. SO after she got off the phone, we put the pieces together CRYSTAL STOLE MY MONEY OUT OF MY WALLET. We calculated everything I spend and in the total I was missing $7. Haha me and ALyssa got Crystal in trouble...shes not welcomed over alyssas house anymore,lol. Alyssa is happy she hates the bitch, shes like 12 and as annoyin as hell. If i see that grl again im gonna beat her,lol.  I love my nails, they look CUTE! ALright...its time to go eat. This weekend its just me and my mom at home.everyone else is going up to tahoe.

      This afternoon I met up with Alyssa for lunch to catch up on everything. I haven't seen her in like a month because of vacation. After lunch we went back to her house and chilled there for a while. We wanted to go somewhere, but there was nowhere to go plus it was like 5PM and I had to be home. We decided that we would have our outing tomorrow. We're getting our nails done and getting a waxing tomorrow after noon, then going to lunch, then we're going back to her house to watch Old School because shes never seen it before. I hope all our plans go ok because usually when I make plans ahead of time they never turn out on how I expect them to go.  Tomorrow Friday the 13th...me and ALyssa just realized that,lol.  My dad's mad because I refuse to go up to our vacatiion home in Tahoe this weekend. I dont wanna go because theres gonna be way too many people there. I'm not a people person,lol. My aunts,uncles,and cousins all bundled up in a house...greeeaat. no thanks. i need my space.

      OMG! I never thought I would say this, but I actually like Ashlee Simpson! haha. no joke...I don't think I would like her as a person though, cuz shes kinda shall we say...annoying? But I just got her new CD Autobiography and I LOVE it...she sounds a lot like COurtney Love. But the album is cool...shes pretty hip,lol. I don't really like her style, but I'm glad shes not just trying to be another blonde pop princess,lol. Shes got a unique look to her and a fresh face. Ashlee is like 110% better than Jessica. I mean I think Jessica's songs are ok, but I dont like her voice, *shrugs* she sounds like a man or I dunno just somehting about it. Ok, well I'm about ready to call Alyssa to see if she would like to go to Taco Bell with me. I will blog more later. '  Watch Big Brother tonight,lol.

      Hey kids- Hows it going? Haha I was bored so i decided to create one of these blogger things cuz they looked cool and I got tired of using LiveJournal.  I haven't talked to any of you in like a month because I've been away on vacation. China was  a lot of fun, I climbed my ass up the Great Wall...according to our tour guide you can see that wall all the way from Mars. I believe it! The thing is massive. I got a good work out in China because all we pretty much did was walk and go SHOPPING! I got some spiffy stuff from Abercrombie and Hollister while I was there and it was like half the price, since all the clothes are made in China. While I was there I got 2 massages and a facial. I met up with a cool chick named Candy! OMG she was soo unbelievably SWEET! The only problem was that she didn't know any English, which made it hard to communicate. But OMG she was soo nice, she drove me around town(wow what a crazy driver) and she also have me this pretty necklace, it has aromatherepy oils in there, the smell made me naucious, so I poured it out. Now I'm just airing it out, maybe I'll put my favorite perfume in there.   K well our plane ride home pretty much sucked ass. It was long and I had to sit behind this annoying Indian kid that kept opening and closing the shade, so I finally like slammed it on his finger. His mom got up and stared at me...I didn't really understand the point in doing that. Seriously, what was she trying to accomplish? Is she tryin to scare me or something..ha yeah right. My grandma had to sit next to her, poor grandma. :-( The lady kept flipping her turban in my grandmas face,lol.  k i'm soo jet lag, I've been waking up at 2 PM everyday. I have no work this week! But I will next week, having a week off is great.  School starts in 20 days...blah.  Teens choice awards are on tonight...Paris and Nicole are hosting! WOOO!!!  k im gonna blog later
