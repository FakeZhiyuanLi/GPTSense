      i dunno shou i be happy for gugu or worry for myself.. got to worry all over again. worry that he might meet someone better mi.. i really cant take gugu for granted. cos he's too good for mi.. he's a blessing to mi.. although sometime feel like slappin him when he give black face!! anyway.. must let go lor. hmm. in fact i really wan him to go to nyjc.. but know sajc will be better of cos. he can jus roll over there every morning. ok ok.. let u tink.. muack. wan to hug hud u now.. this sfternoon we prayed together for the first time.. hee. abit pai say. oso dunno wat to say it out.. i suggest church must really open a class for sayin prayer.. muack..   chapter two.. the art of seduction..   Due to childishness, by jus seein them kissin on stage make everyone tin that jason and xh are together liao.  ppl will jus link them together everytime. haha. when ppl tease at them.. xh wil act as if she veri shy and innocent. so sick. and jason will down there act style oni.. both of them did not clear the doubt of those ignorant ppl. they jus allow the rumours to fly all over the sch.. Why?? because they  simply enjoy ppl seein them as a pair.. haha.. dunno when.. the sch started to haf a trend of writtin letter to each other.. in fact.. xh tin that it's really kidish and bo liao.. see everyday oso need to write letter. however, she took this opportunity to get even closer to jason. she go ask jason to be her so called 'pen pal'. so thick skinned right?? cant stand leh.. but dunno why.. that nerd of the century agreed. this pull them together.. at first, they jus talk abt tin happened in their class and all. den.. that  xh start to talk abt BGR and all.. keep askin jason who he's interested in.. actually right.. she zai zai the ans liao lor.. jus wan to force him to say.. ha..   xh's strategy is usin the power of rumours.. she used ppl mouth to psyko jaason that he love xh.. they are a perfect couple and all.. and this, is the deepest trap jason will ever fall in.. he will nv be able to escape. hee hee.. she will purposely do sometin to let more ppl know that they are in love.. like allowin ppl to peep at the letter and all.   haiz.. so sian.. oso dunno wat to write liao.. muack..

      Countdown to finaly decision: 4days. 13 is a bad number indeed.. I just managed to scrap into SA's range and by 1pt in AC.. This leaves me wif absolutely 0 confidence in any of those schools.. I wan to be wif sugar. But NY is far man.. The school campus looks cool.. i dont know abt the teaching and the tutorials.. whether the teachers are good or sucky.. but the discipline there is slacked.. one thing i'd like.. i dun really mind NY, but the distance.. its like JJ.. only JJ sucks.. haha.. There's a stiff competition for SA and AC now.. how man.. sian.. gimme some time to think it thru.. there are soooo many factors to  my decision now.. i need to tink..

      Chapter One---- the rise of gugu's sugar  Every yr, Banana Primary Sch would force all the classes to perform an item on the Banana sch's b.day.. it's ard august. One of the pri 5 classes, decided to copy a story from their textbk and goin to act it out.  that's when love bind two little kids together.. and the love chain grew thicker and stronger as the 2 kids grow..    Jason was selected to be the sciptwriter as well as the lead actor. it's proberly because there was no other child as eloquent as him and able to master English at that age.. and pls.. it's surely not because of his look.. ha. jason look like a definate nerd that time.. with the ugliest center parting, gold-rimmed specs.. And and.. haha. he was so skinny and short that everyone suspect he came from some ulu third world countries.. however, his knowledge and talent overweight his exterior flaws.. His allure seize every girls' soul.. Muack..   Very soon... the script was done. it's time to select all the actors and actresses.. One girl in the class.. hardly notice by anyone voluntee to be the wife of jason.. everyone was overwhelmed by her.. many girls were eyein for that character in the play.. they all hope that the play will turn into a real life story, married to a hero and live happily ever after.. they were all correct and far-sighted, i must say.. BUt.. one thing they lack for is courage... Except for her---xh.. hee..   infront of the whole sch.. jason propose to xh.. infront of everyone.. jason pecked gently on xh's QQ cheek. infront of everytin, they vowed to remain faithful to each other.. all this was part of the play la.. evey girl under the stage were weepin.. their hearts were flood by jealousy.. and at the same time cursing xh..    hee.. no one knows.. xh had planned that long time ago.. it's jus part of her plan to win jason's heart.. wat will that evil xh do to seduce jason?? and will jason fall in?? pls stay tune... Coming up.. Chapter Two--- the art of seduction.. hee.. muack

      Greetings to everyone on planet earth. I hope you've had a wonderful new year. 2004 is the start of a new path for Faith and I. We've graduated from our secondary schools and are now waiting for our O level results that should be coming out at the end of ths month. I really pray we'd do well and go to the same junior college. This way, i'd get to see her every single day. That would really be nice. For all you Christians out there who reads this post. Friend or fellow Christian, please do pray for us. We've been in different Secondary Schools and we don't want that to happen for our JC lives too. Also, it's valentines soon. You guys better get something for your Loved ones. And keep it a secret no matter what. Well, at least till the day itself. I made a mistake by hinting it to her the other day that it was in my bag at that point of time. I guess you all know the story by now, she searched, found it.. 2 weeks before she was supposed to.. well i was just glad she was happy with it. I'd love to stay on and yak about my life and how we met. But lets save that for another day. Enjoy your lives in Christ. Chiao..

[den he will ban mi from drivin.. :( ] after the wonderful lunch, it's time to spend sometime with my fellow shoppin mates.. we will talk abt our hubby's bed performance[opps]..browse the prada, burberry,louis vuitton catalog.. ya.. once in a blue moon, i will pop up in my hubby's office to do spotcheck.. ya.......... this is essential..      it's time to go home.. and i will again, prepare international cuisine for him. i will surely dress in that particular country costume and ya.. jus to eat.. man will like it i bet. cos they are wat visual orientated creature.  den i will show him wat i bout today!! dunno why.. always at that moment he will start shivering and sweat profusely.. ha.. den, we will watch the tv, talk abt current affair..  i tin my future husband will like to test mi like wat PM goh said in the parliment yesterday.. and all those non-of-my-business tin jus to mock mi...     den finally.. light will be shut off.. ya.. and hee.. ho ho ho.. woo la la..     and that's my ideal life.. and i believe i haf found my "him"..

      This is the first time i post a story abt our past.. so bear wif me if it sounds lame.. or not as funny as it is when its done by sugar. Chapter 5- The cold war After the pri 5 exams.. when sugar found out tt she was goin to 6E instead of continuing in 6D, during the school hols.. our pen-pal habit went on.. until one faithful day when i got a letter from her. it spoke of how we should stop "loving" each other and concentrate on our studies.. it was the day i discovered a new emotion.. rejection. i felt like the world was al black and white. and a hint of anger was birthed in me.. over wht.. i couldnt tell.. over myself? over the whole thing?? just over something.. didnt reply her letter.. didnt noe how to.. wht to write.. whether to go wif the flow and put on a brave front? or express my dissapointment.. couldnt tink.. so decided to remain silent.. when the new term started.. we went back to school.. stil feelin screwed up.. the yr started off lonely and sad.. cant really remember how the yr actually started.. but it certainly wasnt bright and colorful.. i might have faked a few smiles to entertain some friends but deep down... i was really gloomy. the yr went by, and when i saw sugar along the corridors or in the canteen.. i would pretend tt i didnt know her.. and just go about my business ignoring her.. looking back.. i am surprised that i could avoid her for one whole yr.. in such a small place.. ha.. i remember this teacher tt taught me eng and sci.. the 1st lesson we had. and i was already punished.. but there after.. she bacame my favourite teacher.. her teaching was the best of all the others.. somehow.. she felt like a mother in school to me.. haha.. i respected her and looked forward to her lessons.. haha.. this could be due to my liking in the subjects she taught.. sci was always in me.. somehow.. i feel like its already been implanted in my brain the moment i saw light.. my dad used to prais me when we were to do those manly things like fixing lights and all. one time.. we bought a fan.. and i put it together haha.. he was left with his mouth wide open staring at the fan i assembled.. ok.. im digressing.. back to pri 6 life.. somehow.. we were brought back by affinty.. ha.. as if there was such a thing.. but i bought a nike bag that was exactly like hers.. only different in colour.. haha.. it became the talkin pt of the whole level.. soon after.. i recieved this letter from her again.. i thought she was givin us another chance.. my life lit up again.. it was abt the end of the yr. PSLE was comin.. but i was too engrossed in the superficial things i occupied myself in tht i didnt bother abt the national exam comin.. i thought all would be lost after the exam.. including her.. but... well tt i shall leave to the next chapter.. so chill this is already a book.. haha

(definitely).. it says, ".... I... love............... you...... madly........ " ya.. jus this four words. hee..     she's veri confused.. i also.. dunno how to write.. she wrote a letter to him.. wantin to end this growin relationship.. she wrote a simple letter, so simple that it hurt jason deeply..     jason had the worst birthday that year.. because, he received that fatal letter jus before his birthday.. both of them got hurt. sad sad. that was the last letter of that year...    after sch reopen, they avoid each other. even when their fren pull them together, they will qurren??(forgot how to spell).. a cold war between them started.. it lasted nearly a year...

      hey hey.. That wasnt how it went.. haha The playground part was most ridiculous.. haha.. we didnt burn down the place.. cuz if we did.. then it would hv been on the news.. and we would hv been famous.. ha. the fact is that some of our friends came along and helped put out the fire with sand. Though i must admit. It got pretty big at one point of time. And the exam cheating incident.. it wasnt me who got caught.. it was er.. how do i spell her name? er.. Yiru??? well yah it was her fault.. gave us away.. and the teacher actually bought our reason.. haha.. maybe she just didnt want to blow up the matter.. either way, i'm glad we didnt get into any trouble. i remember we used to play Hop-Scotch in the parade square. during recess, before school, after school, haha pretty much all of the time we were free in school. Alot of things had changed since our primary school days. for one.. we lost contact with everyone. so i dont really know how they all are doin right abt now. Its been 4yrs. Time flies.. haha i remember how we would get into fights over trival matters.. acting "beng".. real stupid.

"yeah!", xh cheered silently in her heart.. jason's heart was captured by her. he will do anytin xh wan him to do. so she made use of him..  end of year exam was coming.. u can feel tension everywhere in the sch. no more laughter and joyful conversation. xh was really bad in her academic. she knew no matter how hard she study, she wont be able to pass the exam. she wan jason to provide answer for her during the english exam. that nerd, knowin that was extremely wrong, still agreed to help xh..   during comprehansion paper.. as usual, xh face difficuitiy even answerin the first question. using post it, jason passed the note to her.. BUT!! the nerd!! it is if his brain spin abit slower, but even his action is abit retarded.. haiz.. jason get caught when he passed the post.it. seein that, the teacher immediately called them out and question them...  the teacher was accusin jason for cheating but not xh. dunno from where.. xh's conscience pop out. or maybe, she really put in geinue feelin when settin up the plot. in order to cover jason, she admit that she was the master mind... she herself could not comprehand why she did this. perhaps, that's love. but heng  ar.. the teacher let them complete the paper and nv blow it up..   after exam, it's always the time to slack and zuo bo.. that's the time where xh really feel the tangable love and happiness. they went out every single days.. from playgrd to acarde den to playgrd. their fav game were catchin and u know.. the game where u draw nine boxes and jump ard them, ya that one.. they even organise parties in xh's house.. remember one time, they abandone their fren who were partyin in xh's house and went to the pineapple playgrd to "pak tuo".. cos xh is talented in acting.. they will also act when they are together. this time, jason act as a corpse and xh act as the  pathetic decresed's wife.. they lay candles ard and used "yellow page" as the "kim zhua".. xh was burnin the offering and jason was suppose to jus lay there.. dunno why.. a fire broke off!! (hey hey.. this part is really true ppl..) the fire engulfed the entire "pineapple" in jus a few sec.. they tired to used sand to extinguished, but failed. haha. so how?? of cos jus run away lor... partly is for their life and also to shake off the responsibility they got to took of burning bown the playgrd.. the pineapple playgrd was gone.... that's the wosrt tin they did so far.. ha.. in their memory.. they will always remember the fire of passion..

      Today, i made my decision for the JAE application. I've just got home from sugars. And i have sent in my application and printed the verification form.. Its now up to God to do the posting for me.. Yesterday was a major Sh*t day. Apperently.. they knew abt sugar and waited til the "appropriate" time to ask me.. Which definitely was not yesterday. They made use of the fact tt i traded Hps wif sugar for 1day to accuse me of everything. Which of course, made me pissed off. And they were so headstrong tt they didnt bother to listen to anything i argued abt.. but kept on sayin tt i just went in circles.. Fine.. i shut up for the whole of the night and let em talk all they wanted.. the main objective for them was to find out who sugar was... i would have told them if they were nice. But they employed a wrong technic to dig the truth outta me.. too bad.. even if i wanted to tel them.. i dont now. its on purpose. nothing muach is gonna change, execpt that i see them as big imbeciles who try to tackle me in a rugy match but cant.

      I was so high I did not recognize The fire burning in his eyes The chaos that controlled my mind Whispered I want and he took off his pants Never to wear back again But always in my heart  This boy has taken its toll on me he said love mi too little times before And my heart is melting in front of him I have no choice cause I cant stand his charm anymore wa o o oh oh oh oh oh oh er.. oh  He tried his best to boost my appetite Keep me eatin every time So hard to keep him satisfied Kept take eating like it was just a game Pretending to feel full man I turn around and pay the bill  This boy has taken its toll on me He said love me too little times before And my heart is melting in front of him I have no choice cause I cant stand his charm anymore  He'll eat those leftover things Until he cant take it And make sure everything's finish My worries on his waist Sinking my fingertips Into every inch of gu Cause I know that's what he want me to do

      Hello every one. i just want to tell you guys about this incident that i had on the train just the other day. It goes like this. I was on my way home from school one evening, i took the normal journey. Which was the train from Chua Chu Kang MRT station. The train was not as crowded as it would have been during the peak hours. There were vacant seats and lots of standing room on the train. But there was this group of people who chose to sit on the floor instead! The sat in a circle in the middle of the cabin. Just then it hit me like a ton of bricks(or earth for this matter), it was the AGM of the 土地公s(Tu Di Gongs, Earth Deities)! They got high tech and decided to take the train instead of digging in the ground to get to their distinations. Apparently, all of them were already on the train except for the 土地公s(Tu Di Gongs, Earth Deities) incharge of the the east regions. Either they were early, or the held on to their traditional diggin beliefs. So i walked over to see if i could get any information from their conversation. Then came this tall, dark(soil covered man), he said:" U can catch this on www.GuanYingMa.com.sg, please do not proceed further lest u disturb them in their important congregation. man, these idiots are very IT-savy huh.. haha.. of course this is all just make belief. No actual 土地公 (Tu Di Gong, Earth Deities ) was sighted or any congregation took place on the public transport,SMRT. I just got kinda irritated by these idiots who likes to block the way of other passengers by sitting on the floor. maybe in their villages, its a kind of culture or it could be due to the fact tt they have never seen an actual seat in their lives and hence, do not know the way to sit on one..
