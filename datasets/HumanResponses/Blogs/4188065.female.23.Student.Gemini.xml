      Oh wait, I do and I am.  It's far too late for me to be up seeing as how I have work tomorrow. Oh well. I finally have high speed access again and that pleases me.  The only thing that remains is to find a P2P program that is chock full of Angel, as I'm still missing the latter half of last season. That won't do at all.

      Fenton is mind numbingly boring, though I am pleased/ashamed to say that I watched more good movies in this little stretch than I have in a long time. I managed to watch nothing but British murder mystery and gangster movies for three days. Something about the dialog (I still maintain this is an incorrect, Americanized spelling, spellcheck), the pacing, even the cinematography in all of the movies I watched have a very soothing effect one me. You know, in my most inner bits of consciousness. I don't know what that says about me as a person or a video collector, but there it is.  I feel inspired to write a lot, but Word remains a non-functioning asshat. I need to write, lest I explode and leave a gooey pile of story ideas behind. Open Source word processing here I come.

      Piffle and humph.  Alright, perhaps that's a shade harsh. After all, Blogger's never been anything but kind to me, though I find the house rules a bit antiquated. Registration to comment indeed! I've gone along with it, but I've taken umbrage.  As you can see, I've broken down and registered. But be it known that I only did so because I wanted to be able to post comments on other people's blogs and couldn't unless I got a Blogger name of my own. I was happy that my web nomme de plume wasn't taken.  One of us, one of us, gabba, gabba, we accept you...  Yeah, I know. I'm the only one who's seen "Freaks." Oh well.  Vive Live Journal! Vive Quebec! Vive Jay Sherman!  I'll stop now.

      Apparently I have to make another post to enable comments.  Done.

      ...shouldn't make such noisome whoopee in the room above me when I'm trying to write about desexualized sex acts at Girl Scout camp. It ruins the ambiance. And before you get freaked out, I'm writing another play, not confessing to something that many people assumed happened on a warm summer night so many years ago.  It's for a play.  I mean it.  What are you looking at?  You can't judge me!  ...   Yes, well, in any case, my upstairs roommates, still unknown to me, should somehow be told that their spring squeaking and dirty little nothing grunting carries through the floor. I find that fact odd, as their TV and apparently my music don't travel between floors. Maybe the sine waves in sexy sounds are at such a level that they naturally penetrate any surface within a certain distance. There's research to be done! Though it's unlikely that it will be funded by any US companies. According to Jamie, American scientific organizations are more squeamish about sexual research than European ones. Poor bonobos.

      Yeah. So it looks like my posts did go through, even though they didn't load after-posting pages or as entries in my blog.  *shakes fist* I'll get you Blogger and your little...um...little...well if you've got something little I'll get that too. So there!

      I had a nice post.  Blogger ate it.  Here's the gist of it.  I'm going to make a community blog for writer people and whoever else pops up. I'd been thinking about it for a week or so, but when Ryan spoke with such fondness about the one he'd was on with the folks from the house it was a sealed deal.  I'm off to make it now.

      I got to thinking, after seeing Ryan and Jen, about stuff, which lead to my thinking about other stuff of a similar ilk of which I'd been thinking earlier. (How's that for an opening sentence?) While I am fiercely missing the friends who've moved away or been away the whole time, I'm also not content to sit idly by and hope that we managed to keep in touch.  Along those same lines, I'd been looking at the community blog feature that Blogger offers. A lot of writers I know, who miss seeing and talking with each other when we're off doing our things, would actually blog if there were other people involved. Ryan and I were talking about the blog the folks in the house had once upon a time and it seems like an ideal thing to start up.  I think I'll go do that now.  Ta!
