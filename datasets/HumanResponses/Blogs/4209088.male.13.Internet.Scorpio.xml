      *Sigh*, I am home from the torture chamber, yet again. The day was more fun than yesterday. We got to meet our little 7th graders. Instead of 17, we had 18. They had thrown another kid on us, although, he turned out to be the best kid in the group, so thats good.  There was one kid named Curtis that was obviously the "class clown". He tried to pick a fight with me, and kept acting up. He was being such a pain during one of the name games, that I told him for the rest of the day, his name was Bob, which all agreed and followed aswell.  We did a few fun games, and I used the Quiz we were provided to decide which team got the tape. The boys got the tape, although the girls won the game. The game was called Card Towers, but instead of playing cards, we used index cards. The girls won all of the games, just because the boys refused to work as a team, so the girls got balloons, and the boys did not, haha.  At the end of the day, I needed a drink, badly. I had been yelling most of the day, and my throat burned. So I went up to Mrs. Madden (One of the W.E.B. organizers), and asked her if I could buy one. The coke machines for the public were "off", so I got to use the Staff Lounge ones :). I lent Don (my partner), $1.00 to buy one aswell, but instead, he went to the "off" machines, behind a kid named Young Kim. Young got his powerade, and then Don put his change in, and it ate it. Just then, a lunch lady went back there and yelled at them, telling them they were not allowed back there... O.O. After she left, Don did all he could to get the money back, but it wouldn't be nice.  Needing the $1.00 to buy a drink, Don went up to the lunch lady and said, "The Coke Machine ate my money, can I get it back please?". The snotty lunch lady, of course, made the remark, "Well, you weren't suppose to be back there in the first place, so no." *Sigh*, Donald went thirsty for the next hour and a half, and lost me a dollar, humph. Whatever, I am off to work on my BNM/BNMCP system, then my BBLOG/BBLOGCP later. So I am occupied. Keep updated, tomorrow is my real first day of school, should be oddly interesting.

      Sigh, today was the day of all days. It was the known, and dreaded,  First Day Of School . Technically, it wasn't, but it was the first time I had entered the school for the whole summer (excluding registration). Today, I needed to attend in order to receive instructions based on the next day (Thursday). Thursday, is the 7th graders (Sevies) true first day. I will be there, along with a friend, guiding, and helping a group of Sevies around the school, playing games, and just getting their year started.  After arriving at the school, I slowly entered the front doors, in which behind them awaited my soon-to-be W.E.B. ( W elcome  E very B ody) partner, Don [ald]  Dodge. We started the day sitting at a lunch-room table listening to the overwhelming W.E.B. organizers explain the little details, and created are name tags for the day. Afterwords, we played "demo" games of the games in which we are to play tomorrow, with the Sevies.  Then, after that boring activity, we got to listen to the organizers a tad more... hooray. Next, came the fun stuff.  We needed to pair up with our partner, and find a spot within the commons to sit and work. Afterwords, the organizers handed out our student lists, me and Don receiving a total 17 kids to babysit for half the day tomorrow. With those names, we needed to fill out each ones nametags. We split the names into two, and Don did some and I did some. After I finished my eight tags, I looked to Don to see his progress. Then, it turning clear to my eyes, Don had no clue. He complained the tags were too small, and messed the four he did up.... and I will explain.  My tags, had the students names located at the top of the tag in marker. Underneath, in pen, I wrote the Room #, Team, and Teacher name. This was all done neatly. Don, on the other hand, Wrote the name wrong, and wrote the info around the students name. Hardly being able to read the info on the tag, of course, which caused hectic actions later on.  After eating out free lunch, and doing a few other pointless things, we received our supplies, and our T-Shirts for Thursday, and found our way into the Gym. Within the huge sweat-smell stained palace, we found four tables with the respective Team Names above the tables. We found ours, and needed to organize the names with some of the worlds worst girls. Each having their own unique style of stupidity, they organized, and we watched in awe.....  ....Each girl fought over the name tags, and more chatted about the Student names located on them. After a good half-hour or so of bickering from them, they actually, (amazingly), managed to sort the names alphabetically in rows. WOW! Me and donald cracked up, as the four tags donald wrote, threw the whole thing off. They ended up mixing about half of the tags within the wrong rows, and sadly could not fix it. In comes me and Donald to fix the problem so we could leave....  .... Being the stupid and horribly mean girls they are, yelled and whined at us for touching, so we backed off. Cody Young decided to come over and ask one of the girls a stupid question, "What's with the stockings on the arms?". One girl was wearing these Spider-Webbish stockings on her arms, looking stupid and gothish. The girl screamed at him, and hit him, with no teacher in sight. *sigh*, what an idiot was Cody. He walked away with a bruise.  After I got to leave, we headed to Wal-Mart, where I happened to purchase a brand new leather wallet for a total of $10.37 (precise, eh?). Used change for the .37, and put a $20 in the machine for the other $10. I wanted a ten dollar bill back from the self-checkout, but it didn't want to be nice, and gave me two fives instead... I finally got home, and just worked the whole night. I am now off to bed, as I need to get up in eight hours to go meet Sevies again... *yawn*.
