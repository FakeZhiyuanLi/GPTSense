         Dutch wore their away kits as they battled greatly againt the Swedish. Actually I knew that the Dutch were a better team overall so the outcome was expected. The thing was that I waited and waited expecting Sweden to get thrashed but nothing.  For 120mins including extra time, no one scored. Just to say, as you know Stam is my favourite player of all time he had two shots at goal including a run from halfway and took a fantastic shot at goal outside the box. As a result, it went into penalties. From previous history, Holland had lost to penalties and pressure was on them. 5 shots each were taken, all in apart from Cocu's and a Swedish. To top it off, Robben put the icing on the cake with his match scoring shot at goal with started a mass of cheering.  Even though the penalties was a 50/50 outcome...I knew that Holland would win.

         23.06.2004 saw Holland's ultimate match in the group. Basicly Holland were 3rd on the points table tied with Latvia. CZE were first on the table and they had to face Germany. At the same time, Holland had to face Latvia. The thing was that Germany was 2nd and if they beat CZE it'll be Germany and CZE in the quarter finals. So already we wanted CZE to beat Germany. Holland would have to beat Latvia and become 2nd to go through to the quarter finals as only the 1st and 2nd teams go through.     At first Germany was equal during the match 1 all but CZE being a good team undefeated beat Germany 2-1. This was perfect as it meant that either Holland or Latvia would go through. The goals came flowing in from Holland ending that match with 3-0, goals from Ruud and Makaay. As a result, Holland were through to the semi-finals to face Sweden.

          19/06/04   was Holland's second match. Facing the Czech Republic. At first I didn't know how well the Cze played so I thought to myself that the Dutch could bag aother draw or hopefully a win. I was wrong. It was a 2-3 lose to Holland. But goals are goals, 2 shots went in, I'm proud. Wilfred Bouma, our first Dutch scorer did well as Ruud follows to score the second goal.

            This section is towards my top player of all time, Number 3 ,Jaap Stam       "Jaap Scores in Champions League"      Jaap Stam's profile  Birthdate : July 17th 1972  Former clubs : FC Zwolle,  Cambuur Leeuwarden,  Willem II PSV Eindhoven   POSITION :-Ultimate Defender  DATE OF BIRTH:- 17.7.72  PLACE OF BIRTH:- Kampen,Holland    HEIGHT :- 6' 3"  WEIGHT:- 13st 4lb     The reason I like Stam so much as my favourite football player of all time is because : -He's a defender which is my position too when I play -A great defender and voted the best in the world -Played for Man U which I support     Jaap Stam has had it bad at times but the final results were excellent. Coming from Kampen, Stam had an interesting start to his early years in becoming a star. Even though starting late Stam was spotted by Theo de Jong who at the time was managing FC Zwolle. Stam, spotted at his home town Kampen joined Zwolle during 1991 as so his professional career began. Leaving behind all education Stam wasn't supported much by the people at DOS Kampen. Jaap proved he could make it, he then went international playing for Holland and turned down the chance to play for Sheffield Wed.  He mentioned that he'll return to England some day and "play for a big club", this club, Manchester United. But before Man U, Cambuur Leeuwarden, first division side in north Holland offered Stam £100,000. This happened to become a bad start for Stam as he had an injury and to top it all off, the seaon's end finished off with them being relegated. 2nd season resulted in his team being 5th, much better because Stam felt better !     Jong during 95 had Stam playing for a bigger club, the fee, £400,000. This price was unusual for a lower division defender, they didn't know that Stam was a great player though, the best defender the world has ever seen. It wasn't easy as I say for Stam, he had to prove his doubters wrong. From this, Stam felt comfotable playing in the top division.  This Stam, the one and only then had an offer for £1 million for PSV Eindhoven. I didn't know what was really going on with Stam as I was very young but you could say I knew the outcome would be great !  Pre-Euro 96, Stam's debut for a national team. He faced Germany. Sounds great doesn't it, well not for Jaap, glued to a bench throughout the tournament. Poor ol Stam, only good thing was he learnt what it was like to be involved, his time would come. At least his boss at PSV Dick Advocaat taught Stam a lot "He helped me mature and turn me in to the player I am now".     PSV had won the Dutch Championship in the Dutch cup 97. This year was the best year for Stam too as Jaap was voted  "Dutch player of the year" . After his great years in Eindhoven, Stam felt he should prove himself in one of Europe's bigger leagues. "I wanted to be recognised as one of the best defenders in the world", which he still is ,"and I couldn't do that in Holland"   1998 the famous date when Jaap signed for Man U FC for £10.75million shortly before the World Cup. At this age I certainly understood what was going on and was seriously happy as Stam was coming to a club nearby and I supported. Stam helped United claim an unprecedented treble of Premiership title, FA cup and UEFA Champions League, playing in all 990 minutes of United's European campaign.     It went all down hill for me as Jaap left Man U after a good 3 years. This resulted in me becoming an even bigger Holland fan just to know that Stam would be playing for them still.     S.S. Lazio then took Stam in August 01, his early start to Italy didn't go too well, it was disrupted even and couldn't play for 4 months. I'm not saying what was wrong as I respect Jaap and I think he wouldn't want his personal life spread across the net. Now I've said this you'll want to know now, just don't !

          15.06.2004  was Holland's first Euro04 match. This involved them Germany (with a twist). You see, Holland and Germany were enemies in the war which could result in the reason why there were so many fouls throughout the match, playing dangerously like this meant the referee Anders Frisk had to hand out a few yellow cards. I think this start was both good and bad as  they drew 1 - 1  but bad because a few Dutch got entered into the ref's notebook.  The players which got booked were Cocu, Heitinga, Seedorf & Stam Goals by  30' Frings   81' Van Nistelrooij

                        It began when the Netherlands were placed into a group of 4 with high skills and some not as good, group D. This 50/50 group featured the  Germans ,  Czech Republic  and  Latvia . This group has great players, great talent and excellent skills...but being me, I only talk highly due to my international team being involved, the Dutch.      You can trust and pray all you like but it's only down to the players themselves how their outcome will be ! Knowing the Dutch I know that working together as a group they'll achieve what they set out for, the win, the skills or even just a good match (but we know everyone wants to win). Even though Holland will have a long way to succeed facing many teams, pressure and victories, they'll just have to do their best.     Sea Of Orange / Orange Tide          The 11 men who I think will succeed on this team are :    Goal Keeper  -  Edwin  van der Sar     Defence  -  Michael  Reiziger    Defence  -  Jaap  Stam    Defence  -  Frank  de Boer    Defence  -  Giovanni  van Bronckhorst      Midfield  -  Edgar  Davids    Midfield  -  Phillip  Cocu    Midfield  -  Clarence  Seedorf      Forward  -  Ruud  van Nistelrooij    Forward  -  Arjen  Robben    Forward  -  Roy  Makaay              I only mentioned these 11 as I think they'll be a great team but too I want the people I've not mentioned to do well aswell because everyone together makes a team ! Hopefully these guys will succeed and hopefully win and beat their group moving onto the quarter finals !   urlLink  Group info     Group Information is provided from Euro2004.com

       If you've never experienced blogger before, it's like a diary so the newer entries I've put are at the top. Best to read from the bottom up to make sense as I show you "Holland in Euro 2004"    This section is the comment page if you want to write anything about Holland's time in Euro04. I can only ask you not to write anything bad but I can't control you so what you say is what you think. But anyhow there's completely foul talking around here, like saying Stam's rubbish I'll delete the post cause that ain't right, is it ? I'll leave you to it then !

      As you'll notice I've mentioned that Stam is my all time favourite football player ever. I just want say a few things about him in this Euro 2004. If you read this mate you'll understand why I admire you so much. Firstly Jaap didn't get off to good start against Germany. He shouldn't have got that yellow card at all.  Jaap played fantastic throughout these games, he should have been man of the match too as without him the defense would have been knife through hot butter. I find that Stam during the opening ceremony was solid as he didn't sing but gave a menacing stare, it was great. Should have made the opponents leave cause if you messed with this man you'll wish you hadn't.     Stam had great goal opportunities from his run down centre against Sweden to headers. He inspires me as a defender too as we are the best, no one gets past me, no one gets through Jaap. I too bought a Holland Euro 04 replica orange shirt. I got it customized to say 3 on front and back plus in big letters Stam on back. It's exactly like his and now has become my favourite top ever cause I know a great role model too has one.  Only one things letting me down, I here Stam's leaving international football which will take so long for me to get used to as I mainly support Holland because he plays for them. Another thing which is a shot in the back is him playing for AC Millan. It my be good for him but I wouldn't get to see him as often as it's foreign. I will miss Stam and his perfect footy skills. If he came to Man U or Chelsea I would be very very very happy, he's the world's best defender. Man U needs you back, Ruud and Ronaldo are there too, or even Chelsea where Robben will play.      Quotes by Jaap :   "Ronaldo? He didn't give me any problems."   "Getting rich is not my priority. I always wanted to go to England to play football. I'm coming to United to test myself and win medals. Money comes second after that."   "He's the quickest defender I've ever seen."-Pierre Van Hooijdonk    "It was my way of telling Zamorano that this was my stadium and I wasn't going to budge. I think he got the message."-Stam on his impression of a brick wall against Inter Milan at Old Trafford     If you ever get this message Jaap I hope you understood why I say your my favourite. If I do make it to professional football I'll be using you as my path to success, following in your footsteps (plus when the new Holland shirts come out and you don't play I'll still customize it saying Stam 3 including any club you play for ) Wherever you go you won't let me down !

          30.06.2004.  The day I'll never forget, easy to remember too as Netherlands lost to Porto on me sister's birthday. The semi-final featured the Portugal team scoring 2-1 including their own goal, anyone try to say that Holland are rubbish will have to take it out with me cause it might not have been their best match but they played well for me. My star player of all time Stam was my "Man of the match" as his defencive help was solid and didn't let anyone down as usual. He was backing up players, clearing the ball, everything that a great defender like him should do. He's been great throughout. Holland shouldn't worry though, they always make it to the semi's so that's great. They fought through hard times to get here but somehow the Portugal team won. I respect how the Ducth beat Latvia coming 2nd, great outcome.  I was hoping the Dutch did well, they did well, made me proud and never let me down. You guys did excellent, now it's the World Cup ! You will do it !
