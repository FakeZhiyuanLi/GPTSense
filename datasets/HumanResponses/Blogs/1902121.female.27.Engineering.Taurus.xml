      Man, the people at Old Navy really need to start beating the sweat market laborerers that make their clothes a little bit harder. The quality of clothing there is such shit.   Ahhh, that's right ladies and gentlemen I'm back. I had to delete the old blog for reasons I won't get into here. I was debating on whether to start another one or not, thinking that maybe my blogging days were behind me. But I couldn't stay away. That, and apparently my friends (my loyal fans) really enjoyed the voyeuristic glimpse inside my brain. Scumbags.   So here's the new and improved blog. Henceforth I shall be known on the internet as "Nuggets". I'll ask that if you want to link to me you use my pen name Nuggets or whatever name you want, as long as it's not something people can google and find me with. Ok, that's all for now.

      That fucking joke. Obviously made by some fucking asshole failure who "quit" smoking two weeks ago, but just came back from his mid-morning cigarette break. So yeah, in case you couldn’t tell by my sunny disposition, I’m trying to quit. I am down to only smoking when I drink – which is proving to be the hardest part to give up. I went and got drinks last night and didn’t light up. Which I’m proud of. But at the same time, I’m sitting here in my assy cube completely stressed out and craving one like mad. I was hoping that by making this post it’d help with the frustration. But like those stupid anti-smoking commercials they show on TV, it’s only making me want to go smoke one that much more. HELP!!

      Just wanted to congratulate my favorite local bar,  urlLink the Tir Na Nog , for being voted the best neighborhood bar in Somerville by the Improper Bostonian. I love you guys way more than I should. See you tonight.     Thanks to my friend JBar for pointing out to me that my local bar won such an award. I guess I drink too much to ever notice that kind of thing myself.

      I’ve had so many people tell me that I’m too pessimistic: friends, boyfriends, ex-boyfriends, family members, strangers, old people, the list goes on. But recently I realized that I’m not pessimistic – that I, in fact, am the definition of an optimist… provided you redefine what it means to be an optimist slightly.   Case in point: my friend Marso and I were recently discussing a news story about a man who went into a Romanian doctor’s office for some routine testicle surgery and came out with his penis sliced into three pieces ( urlLink I'm not kidding ). Marso, being a man, was horrified. I quickly pointed out that this might actually turn out good for the man. Perhaps he will have his penis sewn back together (and on), and he’ll begin his new career as a porn star, a la John Wayne Bobbit (Optimistic Viewpoint No. 1). Marso was unconvinced. He felt that sewing on a penis that was still whole was conceivable, but he doubted that reattaching one that had been cut into three pieces would be as easy. Again my silver-lining, can-do attitude took over and I pointed out that it wasn’t like the man’s penis had gone through a paper shredder (Optimistic Viewpoint No. 2).   So you see? I quite obviously heard about the man’s situation, found a way it could be good, and also pointed out how it could’ve been worse, thus putting a positive spin on an a negative situation. I'm practically like sunshine I'm so god damned optimisitc. Put that in your pipe and smoke it ex-boyfriends.

      My friend recently gave me a book for my birthday. Yes, I know my birthday is in April, but this friend has never really been good at getting things done on time. But I digress...  The book is  Wigfield: The Can-Do Town That Just May Not  by Amy Sedaris, Paul Dinello, and Stephen Colbert and let me just say, it is hilarious. For those of you that don't know who the authors are, they are comedy writers. And they are hilarious.  The story is about Russell Hokes who decides to leave his job painting highway lines shortly after he is fired. Despite being unqualified and even more uneducated, he becomes a writer. His first assignment is to write a novel about small town America. That is how he happens upon Wigfield. Wigfield is less a town and more a seedy stretch of road off the highway filled with strip clubs and used auto parts shops. In looking for the salt of the earth for the subjects of his novel, Russell finds mostly low-lifes and morons...the majority of whom live in their cars and motor homes.  But Wigfield isn't just a town with strippers Hokes can ogle, it's also a town that is in danger of being flooded should the State Representative succeed in his plans to tear down the nearby Bulkwaller Dam. It's also a town that might only be posing as one simply so its "residents" can collect federal disaster relief. Hokes hopes that his book will help perserve the little slice of Americana pie that is Wigfield. But more importantly, he hopes that his novel will prove to be the cash cow that will launch him into a life of easy living and easy women.  The book is filled with the most inane metaphors and I often had to re-read sentences to figure out what they were trying to say. It's so poorly written that it is pure comic genius. This is not some stirring piece of literature and if you're looking for an intelligent, thought provoking book - then look further. However, if you want to sit in an airport bar drinking your bloody mary and looking insane as you laugh out loud, then  Wigfield  is for you.

      I had a meeting with a client this morning. I was sort of nervous because we were meeting so that the client could see the treatment system that we installed on his property. It’s my first treatment system that I’ve designed and seen installed so it’s kind of my baby. And since I doubt my own intelligence, I kind of feel like I must have done something wrong somewhere along the way and I was scared the client was going to call me on it (whatever the “it” was).  &nbsp;  ANYWAY, I get out there early to set up, make sure the system is operating properly, etc. He arrives and I show him the components of the system. He asks some questions and I actually know the answers. I show him all the neat things the system can do. The meeting ends and he seems impressed. I get into my car feeling confident, intelligent, and all-around fucking fantastic. I get into my car and grab my seatbelt, reveling in my own powers of awesome. As I’m putting on my seatbelt I look down at my shirt.  &nbsp; My shirt, with the letters sewed on - my shirt, with the extra piece of fabric behind those letters so that the stitching has something to hold on to – my shirt, which I had put on all by myself…was on inside out. Inside out. The entire god damned time.

       My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years. About a year ago, we started talking about marriage. But that's it...just talking. He says he wants to marry me, but when I quiz him about a time frame, he freezes, telling me to "believe in him and to trust him." How long is long enough? Do I resign myself to wait and wait? I really want to marry him, he knows this, but I am growing frustrated and resentful. What should I do?   &nbsp;  Well, I think you need to first ask yourself the question: "Why do I really want to marry this guy?" Generally, the women I know that are so eager to get married feel that way because of one of four reasons: 1) they’re fat, 2) they’re old, 3) they’re ugly, or 4) they’re insane.&nbsp; Now, if your reasoning is due to options 1, 2, or 3 (or perhaps a combination of all three – yikes!), well you should probably put down your recent issue of  Bridal  magazine, stop eating so many&nbsp;hohos, and pull the brakes on the old marry town express and just be grateful that you have someone to love you at all.  &nbsp;  Now, if it’s option 4 (and a great many women fall into this category) you should probably just continue the endless nagging to get married because, like most women, you’re just too insane to fix. It's ok though. I'm sure all good marriages begin with nagging and pressure to make a life decision before one person is really ready. Just for kicks, make sure to ramp up the pressure – threaten to leave, accuse him of infidelity, compare him to the boyfriends and husbands of your friends – men generally respond well to this kind of behavior. Just think, soon you could be  **married** &nbsp;creating a quiet, tranquil, loving home just like Martha Stewart would do - if&nbsp;she weren't in jail...or a total fraud.&nbsp;

      I have to be honest. I really wish, more often than not, that 95% of the people I interact with on any given day would just die. Right in front of me. Without any reason or warning. Just grab their own throats, make that gaspy sound that happens when you lose your breath, and just stop fucking breathing.  Love, Nuggets

       Dear Wippitronic, My girlfriend’s birthday is coming up and I don’t know what to give her. I want her to never forget the evening. Do you have any ideas?   Well personally, I think a gift of cash is the most caring, intimate thing that a man can give to the girl he loves. But the presentation of the gift is the most important. Maybe take her out on the night of her birthday and get her really drunk. Go back to her place, have ridiculously loud and passionate sex, then leave your little cash bundle of love on the bedside table and sneak out early in the morning, unnoticed by her. She’ll wake up feeling special - a truly important and significant person in your life. I can guarantee that she’ll never let you forget that evening.

      I finally got a new computer. I've vowed that my new machine will be used solely for the internet and its associated dowloading of porn. But does anyone know how to erase all the shit that's on my old computer? The only way I can think of is to submerse it in water.

      When I was in college I worked in a Mexican restaurant. For two long years I worked there. I was a good waitress in that I got the job done, but the part where you chat with the guests – you know, the personable part – I was pretty bad at. So anyway, one day I was in my usual “I hate my job” mood and this couple came in. For whatever reason they asked me what kind of cheese Chihuahua cheese was. With my best “No duh” attitude I answered, “It’s cheese made from the milk of a lactating Chihuahua,” and walked away. Well, I guess they didn’t think that was funny or maybe they just remembered they weren’t hungry, but when I came back to their table they were gone. Just like that.  So yesterday I was eating my Mexican food lunch that was covered with Chihuahua cheese and I had a flashback to this little story and I thought, “Damn, it is kind of gross to think of eating something made from the breast milk of a tiny little dog.” But whatever, I still ate it.  My point is this: I need to get back into the service industry - someone with people skills like mine simply should not let them go to waste.

      I have been reluctant to blog about this subject, but I just can’t hold back any longer. My cat is so god damned, fucking cute. Honestly, I love her. Don’t get all jealous. It has taken us a while to get to where we are. When I first got her I was all lovey dovey because she was new. Then after a while the newness wore off and I was just kind of complacent with her. Then I began to downright hate her because she started doing things like “puking” and “pissing on my bed”. Then she stopped doing those things as often and we began to realize how much we had in common - like our love for sleeping, doritos, and bacon. Then I also realized that I was in total control and that she relied on me for everything and that I could fuck with her as much as I wanted and there was nothing she could do - whoever had her before me had her claws removed. So now, five years later, I love her so much that it’s kind of disturbing - even for me. Anyway, I just thought you guys should know. Me 'n' Fatty 4-eva...or at least until she dies...or I have to make the decision to kill her. Yeah, 4-eva until then.

      Has anyone else ever seen the show  urlLink  Miracle Pets  ? Oh my god, it is awesome. It’s on PAX, I think - the pseudo jesusy channel - the one that shows reruns of  Touched by an Angel  and other equally ridiculous touching dramas. I don’t know. I think the premise is something like these people are really big losers and a whole lot of shit is going bad in their lives and then they get a pet, or they remember they have a pet, and suddenly everything is goldy sunlight again.   I watched this one episode recently where this family had some sort of giant pet turtle – although it didn’t live in the house or anything. I think that the turtle just happened into their yard and because their yard was really big, and because turtles move about a mile a year, they claimed it as their pet. Well I guess one day they realized that their “pet turtle” had finally crossed their giant lawn and was now gone. And then, for whatever reason, there was a lot of snow. And then the dad got brain cancer…BRAIN CANCER…and was having trouble getting better. And then the turtle came back and suddenly the guy was healthy again. And then the narrator – the dad from Growing Pains – comes on and says that the turtle was the reason dad got better.  Holy shit.  Miracle Pets.  I love this show.

      But my friend Katie is incredible. Check out  urlLink her brother’s site  where you can download a sampling of her talent.  It Hurt So Bad  is one of my favorites to hear her perform and the studio recording is just as good...just FYI.

      I went to the dentist this morning. It was just a routine check-up so the dental hygienist was the one performing the work. As I’m sitting there, her hands all up in my mouth, spit-sucking machine sucking intently, the dental hygienist looks me directly in the eyes, mid-tooth scrape, and asks, “What’s the difference between tofu and sushi?”   Even the spit-sucker stopped for a second at the sheer absurdity and randomness of the question. And coming from the other room you could hear the laughter of the dentist and the other dental hygienist – laughing because they knew the question was dumb – laughing because they knew her hands were in my mouth and I was scared – laughing because this dentist’s office obviously hits the nitrous tank a little too hard after hours.  And you know, as if that wasn’t enough…after I made it through the dental hygienist portion of the appointment (amazingly, unscathed), the dentist came in to give his two cents on my oral hygiene. He tells me my teeth look impeccable and to keep up the good work. Then, before I can get out of the chair, he places his hand gently on my shoulder and  kisses me on the forehead!   At this point I’m thinking that maybe I’m on some hidden camera show or some sort of reality TV show where they test how much weird shit one person can possibly take. But nope. I get out of the chair, walk into the waiting area, and the receptionist says, “OK, so we’ll see you in six months!”  The rational side of me, the side that doesn’t like idiots in positions where they can inflict pain, the side that doesn’t like to be kissed on the forehead by random fucking strangers, that's the side that knew I should’ve just walked out and never, ever set foot in that place again. But the other side, the side that loves a good story said, “Yup. See ya in February,” and walked out the door.

      I’m not some peace-loving, “why can’t everyone get along”-asking, patchouli-stink-leaving, hippy girl who thinks that the solution to world peace is getting everyone to love each other. In fact, the word I use most often when describing people is suck. But know what? My misanthropic tendencies don’t stop me from having manners. I usually say please, I always say thank you, and if someone takes the time to smile and say hello to me, I will almost always return the greeting.   I was having a discussion with a friend yesterday about why I feel so isolated. In part, he placed the blame on the city I live in. I grew up in Boston so I know how it is. I know the people here are atypically guarded. But I decided to see just how bad it really was. I set out on a mission yesterday. I walked from Union Square in Somerville to Central Square in Cambridge and then up and down Mass Ave – round trip I probably walked about 5 miles. During the entire walk I tried to make eye contact with people. I had a smile on my face the whole time – trying to get the same out of at least one person. At best, I got a handful of half smiles, but most people just turned their heads in order to avoid the eye contact.   So what gives Cambridge? Is it really that hard to return a smile? It doesn’t take much energy. I’m not looking to start a conversation. No time is wasted. You have nothing to lose. When I was in Honolulu I returned a smile from a stranger on the street and several hours later we were skinny dipping on Waikiki Beach. It was one of the most impulsive, fantastic nights of my life (and no, there was no sex involved), and it was all initiated with a smile.   I know this is a new concept up here so I’m going to give the people of Cambridge some slack. But I’m going to keep doing this walk until I get a better response. I’m going to make this city more polite if it kills me. So if you see some asshole girl with a giant grin on her face staring at you – don’t be afraid. Just fucking smile back. I swear it won’t kill you. Who knows? You might even enjoy it.
