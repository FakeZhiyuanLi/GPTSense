      Under existing British laws you can (in theory at least) get life imprisonment for having sex with an animal. Under the Sexual Offenses Act 2003 (see below), the penalties have been reduced to 6 months or a fine.  Just don't take pictures (see below).

      I have always appreciated the sensibilities of more enlightened (realistic) nations like Canada and Great Britain, where the age of consent for sexual relations is sixteen.  Now, however, the Brits are enacting daft legislation that makes having sex at sixteen legal, but having pictures of said legal sex illegal.  What?!    The  urlLink Sexual Offenses Act 2003  is due to come into effect in May 2004. One important change involves the definition of a 'child' under the terms of the Protection of Children Act 1978. Currently the Protection of Children Act defines a 'child' in Great Britain as a person under 16 years of age and makes illegal the manufacture, possession and distribution of indecent photographs of children under 16.  I have no problem with that.  However, Section 45 (2) of the new Sexual Offences Act will raise the age of a 'child' for the purposes of this Act to 18. The effect of this will be retrospective, applying to all such images, regardless of when they first came into circulation.  Okay, sorting this out, it is legal to have sex at sixteen in Great Britain, and was legal to record it for posterity, but in May, images of such legal sex will become illegal while the sex itself does not.   What?!

      Ohio lawmakers gave final approval to a measure banning gay marriage and prohibiting state employees from getting benefits for domestic partners.  The bill is considered among the most far-reaching in the nation because of the benefits ban, which applies to unmarried heterosexual and homosexual couples.  Yet again, the USA demonstrates it's social and sexual immaturity.

      In yet another attempt to get the world to spin their way, today, the recording industry sued 532 computer users it said were illegally distributing songs over the Internet.  These are the first lawsuits since a federal appeals court blocked the use of special copyright subpoenas to identify those being targeted.  The RIAA really needs to give up this fight and find ways to profit from this new media paradigm.  We want our music, okay?!  We want good music!  We want talented artists to be promoted to success!  What we don't want is to spend $17 a pop on over-packaged pap, only to discover you have sold us another one-hit-wonder.  You don't want me to download the album?  Fine, let me listen to the entire thing, streaming, not just the first few seconds of half the songs.  Too much bandwidth?  Fine, let me open it up in the store and listen to it there.  Make the package easy to get into.  That will save  you  money, and after all,  your money  is what this is all about.  It certainly isn't about my money, and it certainly isn't about the artists' money... I know musicians with five albums under their belts who still have day jobs.  I buy  more  CDs now that I can hear them first, so sue me!

      After seven years of debate, Ohio lawmakers moved closer today to passing a law that would bar Ohio from recognizing same-sex marriages and keep some state employees from getting benefits for their domestic partners.  Don't these politicians have anything better to do?  Let's pass a law that bars us from recognizing the rights of certain others to enter into consensual, loving, supportive relationships.  After all, the next generation might not be so uptight and insecure.  They might think same-sex couples have the right to contract, and to take care of each other, and to --  God forbid!  -- have equal protection of the law.  Can't have that, can we?

       urlLink HOLLY MULLEN  describes Utah's rush for legislation banning gay marriage as, "put[ting] up a picket fence to stop an avalanche."  She is so right.  When San Francisco mayor, Gavin Newsom, began issuing marriage licenses to homosexual couples, it was Rosa Parks refusing to sit at the back of the bus all over again.  The shot has been fired, the avalanche has started.  Equal rights for gay couples are inevitable and essential if we are truly intending to have a free and just society.  It's social evolution.  Those who are truly against it are living in a psychological stone age, self-imprisoned within the crumbling walls of their paternalistic power regime scheme.  They can't win because in this new Communication Age they cannot control access to information and ideas, personal experience and perspective.  The equilibrium of tolerance will be achieved through familiarity, as more people are exposed to the diversity of humanity.  Sit back and enjoy the show!

      SCIENTISTS IN GERMANY are preparing to begin human testing of a new HIV vaccine. If all goes well, the vaccine could eventually go to market in seven to eight years.  Seven to eight years?!  I know it takes a long time to get drugs on the market, but you would think something this major, if successful, could be pushed through a little faster.  It obviously works on monkeys.  Those lucky monkeys are probably shagging away like sailors on holiday as I'm writing this!

      Terri Carlin, the Knoxville woman who suffered "serious injury" after having been exposed to the pixilated image of Janet Jackson's breast, has dropped her class action lawsuit against Ms. Jackson, Justin Timberlake, MTV, CBS and their parent company, Viacom, just one week after filing it.  Methinks she got tired of people rolling their eyes and snickering when she walked by, but according to Carlin's dismissal paperwork, she plans to wait and see if outrage over the incident will prompt new measures to prevent "indecent" material from airing on primetime television again.  It probably will.  Few forces are as effective against Freedom, Beauty and Truth as good ol' moral outrage.

      Santa Cruz police were ordered to return 18 oz. of marijuana confiscated during a traffic-stop, because the marijuana was legal.  California's medical-marijuana law allows individuals to grow, smoke or otherwise use pot under a doctor's recommendation, which, in this case, was a valid prescription.  Of course, here in Tennessee, the confiscated marijuana would most likely have been sold in the next county over before it could be returned, but that's a rant for another day...

      I want to wake up and be relieved this is a bad dream, but I'm pretty sure it's happening.  It seems so surreal, like I fell down the Rabbit Hole, or ate the Brown Acid everyone was warned about at Woodstock.  Terri Carlin, a Knoxville, Tennessee woman, filed a proposed class action lawsuit yesterday against Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, MTV, CBS and Viacom, contending she and other viewers were injured by their "lewd" actions during the Super Bowl halftime show.  The  urlLink lawsuit , filed by Knoxville attorney  urlLink Wayne A. Ritchie II , states, "As a direct and proximate result of the broadcast of the acts, (Carlin) and millions of others saw the acts and were caused to suffer outrage, anger, embarrassment and serious injury."  Serious injury?!  I currently live in Knoxville, and it's often embarrassing and difficult to deal with.  The general reaction to Janet Jackson's breast has made it (yet again) embarrassing to be a U.S. citizen, much less one stuck on the big, shining buckle of the Bible-Belt.  Serious injury?!  I have to wonder if breast-feeding children are somehow protected from the serious injury that breast exposure can cause.  Perhaps they have a natural resistance.  I also have to wonder if this is a cumulative risk.  I mean, I have been directly and incidentally exposed to A LOT of breasts over the years!  What are the signs I may have a problem?  And to think, I was worried about Mad Cow and the Bird Flu.

      The Massachusetts high court ruled today that only full, equal marriage rights for gay couples — rather than civil unions — are constitutional, clearing the way for the nation's first same-sex marriages in the state as early as May.	   The four justices who ruled in favor of gay marriage said, in the advisory opinion requested by the state Senate, "The history of our nation has demonstrated that separate is seldom, if ever, equal."  This decision is important because, under the United States Constitution, states are required to give full faith and credit to legal contracts (such as marriage) from other states.  That means a couple married in Massachusetts is married in every other state they visit or reside in.  This makes it a problem for states like Ohio, who have recently enacted legislation banning same-sex marriage protections.  Expect this to go to the Supreme Court, where hopefully the matter will be resolved once and for all.

      Janet Jackson flashes a boob at the Super Bowl, and we're  still  talking about it!  People are offended... outraged even.  What's outrageous is that anyone would give the brief exposure any significance.  Let's consider for a moment that a breast is part of human anatomy.  The female breast is more pronounced than the male breast, because hormones in the female body cause it to be so.  A breast is a natural feature, like lips and hair and fingers and toes.  It should really come as no surprise that Janet Jackson has breasts.  She actually has very nice breasts, and to look upon them is not unpleasant.  So what's the big deal?!  Why are Americans feigning apoplexy over this incident?  Do we need to remind the world that we are a nation of sophomoric hypocrites when it comes to sex, or even the mere suggestion of sexuality?  "Children should not be exposed to this."  That's the argument I keep hearing, and it's pathetic rhetoric.  What is the possible good reason for teaching children to be ashamed of their bodies, or any particular parts of their anatomy?  Girls are going to develop breasts, and boys are going to see them.   It's normal.  It's natural.  It's hardly shocking.   Children should not be exposed to glorified or graphic violence.  Children should not be exposed to professional wrestling.  Children should not be exposed to commercial advertisements.  Children should not be exposed to poor nutrition.  Children should not be exposed to neurotic, insecure adults making much ado about nothing!  It's a breast.

      I was too busy and distracted to mention this last week, but Helmut Newton died in a car accident outside L.A.'s Chateau Marmont.  Newton lived a huge life. He learned photography in the decadence of Berlin in the '30s, then fled from the Nazis as they took power, and sailed to refuge in Singapore. That’s a whole life right there. Most people would feel happy if that was their finished biography.  It wasn't the end for Newton.  He has been called the most popular and the most copied photographer of the twentieth century.  His images are cruel and cold and sexy. His photographs were very much about the places where they were made. Paris, Monte Carlo, New York and Berlin were shown their character through his work. His Los Angeles photographs featured nude starlets, Cadillacs and the Chateau Marmont.  He introduced kink and sex, power and cruelty into fashion photography.  When he photographed women, he made them look strong, powerful, statuesque, beyond sexy... everything a woman should be.  Helmut Newton was a Master.

        urlLink JOHN KERRY  finally said something I can agree with. Regarding stem cell research, Kerry said this:   "The is not the way we do things in America," Kerry said in the Democrats' weekly radio address. "Here in America we don't sacrifice science for ideology. We are a land of discovery, a place where innovators and optimists are free to dream and explore."  "We know that progress has always brought with it the worry that this time, we have gone too far," Kerry said. "Believe it or not, there was a time when some questioned the morality of heart transplants. Not too long ago, we heard the same kind of arguments against the biotechnology research that now saves stroke victims and those with leukemia."  Such work, Kerry said, is too important to risk for an ideological base and must be "a priority" in the nation's medical community.   I'm still not going to vote for him, but at least he isn't a totally idiot.
