I&nbsp; was telling a close fren in school that I really do regret being too hard on my kids.&nbsp; No homeworks,  OUT  they go.&nbsp; Refuse to answer my interrogation,  OUT  they go.&nbsp; Jumping up and down in my class,  OUT  they go.&nbsp; He he... we are getting sadistic aren't we?   I really gotta change cos this attitude of mine s really draining even me out.&nbsp; Lucky for me, my kids - 35 of em, are ever so outrageously cute! They keep me fit, fun and fab!    &nbsp;  I miss my fiance.&nbsp; I can't wait to meet him tomorrow.&nbsp; I hope he fetches me from school.&nbsp; Oh by the way, oral exams for P6 so... well... duty calls...    &nbsp;  Hi to all bloggers... stay fit and strong my frens... its FRIDAY!!

      I mean, migraine, head pain, giddiness. My new specs prescriptions clashes wif my contacts'. Bugger. For 2 and 1/2 weeks I've been tolerating my excruciating pain in my already hay-wired head!!  I'm just gonna wait for pay day before making my new prescriptions. I may look cool n bold... but now i'm real cold n a puddle of mush or mud for tat matter. Tis head pain really makes me drag drag drag!!  When I compare myself to a yr before, there are some improvements. Mood swings lesser. Body tighter. Skin tanner. But the head, head-acher!! *oh Nurul stop complaining bout your head. Lucky u still haf one!!*  Oh how lovely if I could just fast forward to Friday. 3 hours of school. Den smashing good-time lunch wif dearest Pauline n crazie colligs! At nite, proposed dinner wif Sazymaera aka Helena. Oh... y does she call herself that? ;]  Den a super long weekend till next Wednesday where I'll go out n enjoy, swim, play table tennis, jog, train.... sigh.. You mite be wondering wat kind of triathlete I am???? Well, I'm an aspiring one. My goal, simple. To be fit n active so that my body does not hamper my abilities to do anything.... including ber'ibadah'...  Well... gotta go... Napha Test duty starting soon... I'm taking the 1.6km run... Take care Diary... Can't wait for Mr Zirk to fetch me from school... by the wae, he's the fiance.... hehe...

      wENT swimming wif my fiance today.  Both of us had no mood to swim as the Bukit Batok swimming pool, although fabulous now, was much too crowded la!! How to swim! Half way across n we bump into a float.  Swim diagonally and we get kicked by a wild uncivilized leg! Swim vertically and the juniors swim dangerously wif no regards to me who s already half blind by my misty gonna-haf-to-chuck-it goggles! sigh.  Such s the danger both of us haf to face in the pool.  But the sun was fab! I and fiance feel so fab!!  Watching the repeat telecast of Anugerah now.  The RUFFEDGE is it? urm... they're more superb than I tot they were se! My fiance loves them since a long time back.  He's busy studying now.  I wish him well for his term test tomorrow.  His reservist is also tomorrow.  Sigh. I'm gonna miss him again.  I think we're in the love mood again.  When are we getting married? November next yr... few days before my b'day.  Hehe... den can spend my birthday together YEAH!  Meeting gal pals dis coming friday.  Wat shall we do? WOrkOut, Pig out or simply LAZE around? wat shall we do, wat shall we do?  Morro school! I miss my small sweetums!! Over and OUT!

      got this from my isLamic emaiL circLe...juz wanted to share with aLL of you because girLs in hijab & tight cLothings are a  NORM  in sunny  urlLink   ...if you know of any sisters who faLLs in this category, pLease heLp to spread da'wah to them...may Allah SWT reward you for it...   Girls who wear hijaab n tight clothes    "Asalamu Alaikum  in my area and in many western countries you see these moslim girls wearing hijaab but tight clothing such as jeans n tight tops. once i said to this girl that she shouldnt bother wearing hijaab because it contradicts with the other clothes she is wearing and told her that if she wants to wear hijaab she should cover her WHOLE body in an appropriate way to make the hijaab worth wearing. she also flirts. i mean whats the point in wearing a headscarf if you going to show off your backside and your figure and chase guys? was i right in doing this? By the way, am I backbiting by writing this question?   jazakallah    "Re: girls who wear hijaab n tight clothes  As Salaamu Alaikoum,  Praise be to Allah.  Yes you told this girl right. The Prophet (SAW) said,   "There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen yet. People with whips like the tails of cattle, with which they strike the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, walking with an enticing gait. They will not enter Paradise nor even smell its fragrance, although its fragrance may be detected from such and such a distance"  The scholars interpret   clothed yet naked   as referring to women who wear tight clothes or light clothing that does not cover what is beneath it, or short clothes.  To warn or speak out or warn against something that harms the Ummah is not backbitting.  AND ALLAH SWT KNOWS BEST"

       "Those who show compassion to the weak, treat parents gently, and pardon the enslaved shall be granted an easy death and the delights of Paradise."    - The Prophet Muhammad, as reported by Ja'bir bin Abd'Allah   happy beLated mothers' day to my dearest mummy and aLL mothers and mothers-to-be...i Love you many2,  urlLink MAMA RUSNINA !!...  didnt ceLebrate mothers' day cos' for me, EVERY DAY is mothers' day...you dont need a day to ceLebrate your Love for your mummy...nevertheLess, i bought my mummy a COOKBOOK...its about NONYA cooking...yummy!!...  received a wonderfuL emaiL and wanted to share it with aLL of you to remind you that   SYURGA ITU TERLETAK DI TELAPAK KAKI IBU  ...   From: Abdullah AM Sent: Sunday, May 09, 2004 6:06 AM To: info@al-islamforall.org Subject: In ISLAM Every Day is Mother's Day  One day a man came to see the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. It seemed that he was trying to solve something but couldnt quite work it out. So he asked the Prophet. ''Tell me, O Prophet!'' I have many relatives and many friends whom I love, and whom I wish to care for and help. But I often find it difficult to decide which of them has the greatest claim upon me? Which of them should come first?'' The Prophet replied immediately, ''Your mother should come first and before all others.''  The man was very pleased to have this clear guidance from the Prophet. But of course there were all his other relatives and his friends, so he asked ''and after my mother, who has the greatest claim upon me?'' The Prophet's reply this second time surprised him. ''Your mother!'' he said again.  The man wondered why the Prophet was repeating himself. Perhaps he had not spoken clearly, the man thought, so he asked the question again, ''What I want to know is, after my mother, who has the greatest claim upon me? Again the Prophet said ''your mother!''  Your mother, your mother, your mother! The Prophet had now said it three times. Slowly, the man realized why he had done so. ''The Prophet means that my mother is extremely important, so much so that my duty to her must be stressed over and over again. Even so, the man's thoughts ran on, ''what about all the others I love and wish to care for?'' Still uncertain and wanting to know more, he once again turned to the Prophet and said, ''and after my mother, who comes after her? Is there anyone besides her?'' The Prophet then replied ''after your mother, your father.'' ''And then?'' asked the man. ''Then people who are nearest to you,'' said the Prophet. Allah's peace and blessings be upon the Prophet.  ==================================================================   ohh, the BBQ on saturday was so-so onLy Lah...the food was OK onLy...apriL, eiLeen and i rchd the pLace at ard 7.15pm den me & apriL Left at around 9.20pm...eiLeen sneaked off earLier...we pLayed some chiLdish games Like WHACKO and this other game where our ang-moh Lecturer had to say something in mandarin and we had to guess it...LAME sia!!...we took some photo...once they emaiL the photos to me then i wiLL upLoad into my onLine aLbum...  ok, i guess this is about aLL for my bLog today...gotta continue sending more resumes...

      finaLLy, i found the time to bLog...Last weekend was our company retreat cum customer service training caLLed,  "DELIVERING BREAK-THROUGH SERVICE" ...photos are not upLoaded yet...  weLL, during the training...we spoke about interpersonaL skiLLs...Like many other companies, we too have our own office poLitics...so today, i forwarded this emaiL caLLed  "WARM FUZZIES - A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS" ...YOU can do this too - to make another person smiLe...remember, "a smiLe is a gift to aLL of us, use it to make it Last"...   From: Nur  Sent: Thursday, July 15, 2004 10:06 AM Subject: Warm Fuzzies  interpersonaL skiLLs?? a kind act to make the other person smile…  from www.care2.com Warm Fuzzies: A Random Act of Kindness	    Adapted from How to Read Signs and Omens in Everyday Life, by Saravananda Bluestone (Inner Traditions, 2002).   When the author was a camp counselor, she reports that stress levels were high and exhaustion was epidemic--until she tried this exercise with a group. She noticed an almost immediate shift away from stress and irritation toward more relaxed ways of being, not only in her group but throughout the camp.  	 Simple Solution:  The key : Writing anonymous, loving, sincere letters that expressed appreciation for someone else in the camp. Evidently, everyone can use a few real, genuine warm fuzzies. And the author notes that the people who enjoyed it the most were the ones who wrote the letters!   If you would like to practice more random acts of kindness, try this with your co-workers or other group (or you can go it alone). It only takes a minute and the results are well worth it. Here’s how to make the world a warmer place, one letter at a time:   Here is the formal “game” approach:  1. Play this “game” with three or more people.  2. Take a few minutes for everybody to concentrate on the others in the group. Try to pick up some characteristics about each person, the way he carries himself, the way he speaks, anything.  3. Write one paragraph to each person in the group. Without judgment, write something kind and sincere about the person that has to do with who that person is. It is not at all necessary to know the person you are writing about.  4. Put the name of the person you are writing about on the paper, but do not include your name.  5. One person collects the papers and distributes to the others the warm fuzzies that were written about them.  6. Each person reads some or all of his aloud.  7. No comments are allowed.   Here is the individual approach:  Simply write a sincere anonymous letter to someone you know, focusing on some quality of theirs that you like or admire.    SO HAVE YOU MADE A PERSON SMILE TODAY??

      my house, became an unofficiaL sheLter for some stray cats since 2 years ago...i've grown pretty attached to most cats who came...  Last tuesday, mummy dearest brought home a LittLe kitten she found near the oLd HDB HQ at bukit merah...the kitten was aLL skin and bones...its eyes were fuLL of mucus and it was very dirty...i cLeaned it and feed it and i was pretty sure that it wiLL grow heaLthiLy with us...  BUT just now,...we woke up to find it dead!!...we were not sure what caused it...  it was just yesterday night, i was feeding it with miLk and the kitten opened its eyes to Look at me...for the first time, it opened its both eyes!!...i was very happy but LittLe did i know that my happiness wouLd be short-lived...  even though the kitten had been with us for 3 short days, i feeL that it had been with us for the Longest time...  we haven't even give him an officiaL name and we didn't take a photo of him...yesterday night, i just brought home a box-cover to make it into his bed...ARGH!!...  mommy said that it is better that the LittLe kitten died in our house rather than it died in the streets...  it's not the first time that i experience the death of an animaL...the very first time was my pet rabbit, our very first pet...  i am praying that it is Living a wonderfuL Life now over at the other side of the rainbow...Allah SWT Loves you more than we do...
