       i mined through the crumbling earth hoping the deeper i dug the closer i was, to the womb, to chaos  and the beginning of creation where the brilliance of light would flare like the sun, no longer eclipsed by our sleighthanded  passions and curious blinded eyes.

       dwelling in the caverns of our minds something that we'd found long ago but lost to the darkness of neglect, the first love for words and blue sky.

        Your special day   Your special day is not  entirely made up of the  usual smiles, the usual  tongue wrestling kisses. Oh no it calls, for something extraordinary. A brilliant, ingenious brew of hedonistic delight with divinely inspired  appetisers and desserts.  Perhaps to start off  a skirt reminiscent of lolita and strappy heels to compliment a virginal white blouse with no frills.  Then as the appetiser whisks by you smell the innocent floral scent like mint dressing on tender lamp chops.   In case you're still dreaming  then well-toned legs earned from hours in the gym will wrap around your waist and the main course can begin.   Any girl who loves you this much would do all of the above and more.  They could moan and promise to love you forever, until the next moon and lifetime.  As they melt in your mouth, their passionate replies would gratify your desires and when you are finished, there won't be  anything left to find fault with.  So what has a virgin,  with God's given gift of temperance, anything left to offer you?  Surely her knitted sweaters and home-made cards  will find a cosy space in the back of your mind sooner than the just baked brownies on the table.   For each bite from the edge to the heart of its chocolate centre, you remember the times when coming home brought relief and comfort to your free-ranging spirit in the world.  For each nut you encounter, memories of her trigger beginning with the time you peeked at her changing, seeing her silhoutte on the curtains.  There weren't many nuts but they were just enough to bring you to the point when she wrote her first poem for you, after all  the love letters you've sent.   Your special day, I didn't forget.  Of course I have a gift.  It's a fortune cookie with a message in it. When you're finished with the appetisers,  main course and dessert,  you'll find my gift still there  and a message that will tell you what all of this means.  But till then,  how can i spoil the surprise?

       Missing someone can be such a deadly enterprise. She misses him as a friend but you can't help as a bystander to entertain the doubts that there could be something more to this friendship then what they claim it is. She handles the pain well enough she considers. There is the mug of coffee, the bar of chocolate, the steady, loving, dependable and perfect boyfriend to run to and hug. Then it's only tonight that is strange, that she misses this dear friend.   Flipping open a book and reading the words off the page aloud. At first the sense of these words does not come across. She sits herself cross legged on the floor and places the book on her bed, rereading it silently. Tracing back the life within the sentences, replaying the anxieties of the characters in that single sentence. She understands the paragraph and leans her cheek upon the bedsheets, looking at the apple green wall of her room. She needs to think. Something has happened and suddenly a fact has become clear. Deep inside there is a strange stirring as if a note resounded in the chambers of her mind. A key has been struck but what is that key? She traces the note, riding the waves of a simple note. And she smiles. Well, perhaps we won't get it all cleared up today. She misses him. It's as simple as that. She misses him even as she hugs the one she loves. She will just miss him who was as if an extension of herself. She just misses him. He had a brilliance about him that she could understand and see herself extending towards, gently letting the tendrils curl around his edges and fingertips.     From him, these feelings of longing trace themselves back to the throbbing centre of her heart. There is a deeper longing than this for a friend which overshadows every other longing. God would know. He would know our attempts to chart the wilderness of our hearts and by his grace, allows us to retrace sometimes a particular feeling or mood to know the way that would lead us back to our hearts. But one wonders what one would find there in the very core of a person's heart. Already there have been suspicions of an empty vacuum just as the people from the ancient world (i think) thought that the world was flat and the waters of the ocean fell into a never ending abyss. Then that would be perfect for God then to say that He would be the only one to fill that vacuum. Then our books would never need to be reread again.   what a wonderful book she thought. In this one paragraph she thought she might have glimpsed something that was once so obscurred by the scurryings in life. That would be enough for her and perhaps now would be a good time to call up that friend of hers.

       Throat is parched. The first few gulps of water had not brought any relief. Recalling "The Little Prince" and how the main character found himself in the desert. Do thirst and sore throats always evoke cliche images of the desert for me? It cannot be helped. Life is an entire series of cliches you get lost in. Everything has been thought of and created, shown off and reclaimed by merely different names and different cultures. Ultimately, all that we create in our writings are merely the vague feelings that others have not experienced yet. It is only a matter of time before we go through the cycle of feelings, emotions, rational thoughts. Almost as if our minds were washing machines, whirling and spinning the rags in circles.    I think of the students that I will never teach. Only seeing these faces rushing towards me and running their own course, leaving this place and their teachers behind them. Standing in assembly everyday and approaching five years of doing that, I trade my flesh for stone and concrete as I am slowly being carved into a pillar. Just withstanding the daily pressures and overcoming the infrequent but intense, overwhelming urge to run away has indeed taken away much of my naivity and a little of my idealism. The heart takes a couple of knocks and becomes a little wiser, perhaps a little stronger to undergo future experiences with much more fortitude. But being a pillar... sucks. I wonder if my senior colleagues ever notice as they pass by the many full length mirrors in the school hallway. Well they are there for the students to keep their pleats straight and their hair in place yet they could have perhaps revealed something else if allowed to. It could have revealed to Mrs. Tan that she has been having the same hairdo for the last five years and possibly much longer than that from what I have gathered. Then several of the other ladies could do something about the carpet rags that they swathe their bodies with like bandages. Pillars get dirtied. They perhaps suffer the indignation of being trapped in the helpless stoic facade when abused over lengths of time. Pigeon poo, graffiti, flaking paint you can think of others I'm sure.   Their single devotion to teaching is worthy of respect. I can't imagine letting a major part of one's life, like career, be anything but a passion, a conviction. But someone has to do the work of conservation, occasional renovations to these pillars. Certainly, I'm not flippant about the function, practicality and crucial role of pillars but surely, it does not harm to beautify the things that deserve our  utmost attention and respect.   And that is just a thought that I would like to bring across. I know that many here would think this is superficial, unnecessary and certainly not surprising coming from one of the junior teachers. But there must be someone to say something about this, to put it into words and speak it verbally to you. I might have done all these in cliches from images to the very argument or idea behind what I wrote but all these are bearable. You might disagree but I think that a worser thing than all this,   is the inability to write further.

       The house was in near complete darkness. When I sat out in the living room with the lights off, on the floor and leaning against the sofa, I wondered why the house was never in complete darkness. The moon would then be covered by dense clouds which was a common sight so it's not possible that moonlight was illuminating the outline of the sofa, the deckchair and the cabinet filled with knick knacks. Perhaps not a very logical conclusion but on this side of the globe, it's always so cloudy. I don't get to see stars most of the time and whenever I do, it is almost like a miracle to me, a sign from God perhaps. Always comforting to know that there are stars in the sky, watching you walk the lonely stretch of road leading to your apartment.  But to think logically, there is light even in the dead of the night. The lights in the corridors of neighbouring blocks, even the lights in the playground and the orange lights lining the roads could somehow be reflected by the objects of this house. Every ray counts. I wondered whether it was because it was not so dark outside too that made me think my house was not completely in the dark. What your eyes behold far away seem to be drawn closer to you, filling your mind with a different reality and suddenly, you are no longer in the dark anymore.   But it doesn't really matter even if my apartment was in the dark. I knew where the wall sectioned off different parts of the flat, where the fan is placed exactly in the dining room although I tend to misjudge its proportions in my sleepiness and bump into the dusty fan head. I knew where the kitchen was and two steps from the entrance  would lead me to the fridge. I opened the fridge door and blinked my eyes a couple of times as they got accustomed to the sudden yellowish glare.   In my dream, I reached out for a beer bottle. I don't know how I cranked it and took a huge gulp. I felt really good to drink that beer. I don't remember tasting it in my dream but just gulping it in such a ravenous fashion thrilled me immensely. Instead of giving a sigh of satisfaction and lingering longer in dream world, I woke up in shock. Beer never tasted this good. I haven't drank one in a long time, haven't stepped into a joint to get one, haven't felt the mood then to sip one at home. I haven't done alot of things that people my age are doing still, for a very long time. 2 years and 5 months to be precise. I sat up in bed, breathing deeply, attempting to calm myself down. I refused to think, to analyse and reflect. The essential eight hours of sleep was crucial in enabling me to endure the daily 12 hours teaching stint in my neighbourhood school. It will give me the much needed refill of energy but most importantly the self-esteem one gets when the eyes aren't bloodshot, puffy and weighed down with purple pouches of skin. So sleep it was and I prayed that a slit of light won't penetrate my dreams until my alarm clock said so.

       If they had a child they said they could be twiddly happy, they would be able to play the fiddle and burst into song every other day. Oh if it was a boy or a girl with sweet little curls  and eyes like mine and hands like yours, what joy they thought  they will have!  So God granted their prayers, trying to make haste while their  hopes still sustained them,  gving shape to their lovely vision.   As her tummy grew bigger, they smiled so much that their eyes disappeared and their mouths became like slices of melon.  At last when the child finally came with a whoosh and a pop sound, they were smiling so badly they couldn't see what it looked like.  But the doctors' cheers fell into a deadly silent and no cry came from their baby's lips.  They knew something was wrong.  Slowly their eyes popped out and  grew like saucers.  They couldn't believe what they saw.  It was a burtonish nightmare. It was like discovering their child had penguin flippers instead of hands.   The child cooed and blinked its eyes.  As the doctor had lost her grip on it, it took the liberty to flap its wings.  Mummy and Dad were not so much aghast that it had wings but that it was a chocolate baby boy with wings.  For mummy and dad were white, as pure as  soya bean milk which they imagined would be pumped out of mother's breast.  Whoever heard of a black angel! The monstrosity, the blasphemy! Its eyes were green and its lips were red.  In addition, it was born with a silver tutu as if God was making a mockery out of them.  When God was in haste, He certainly was not very careful. They froze in muted terror, wondering if the devil would appear.   But the little boy kept flapping his wings  and soon he was lifted off the table. He looked strangely adorable, the light from the surgical lamps shining upon his chocolate body. Making him blacker in the eyes of his parents but giving him a sudden radience in the eyes of those from on high.  He slept while the wings  lifted him up and out of the window.   Thank God the devil took it away from their bloody arms.  They sighed, relieved that they will never have to customise his clothes or face the wordless shame from the sunday school teachers.  A K-Mart baby would be fine they agreed and decided to be more specific in their prayers.

       The trip to the mall was strangely invigorating. Strangely because this time she was not the one doing the shopping but the observer of another happy individual indulging in this past time. They came to the section where you could string your very own necklace and bracelet with the gazillion number of beads that they offer. Looking at the rows of colors, materials, contours and shapes just made her very happy. It was like attending a fashion show. The riot of colors from the colored bras to the psychedalic tops and now the beads dazzled her like never before. This was so because she had just realised that her life was in a major monochrome crisis. She always wore pink or purple paired with something white. When shopping only purple and pink things really made her heart raced. It was as if all this while going through the mall, she was colour blind, only able to react to certain shades of color and oblivious to the rest or whatsoever colour harmony there might be with a rack of clothes.   Her eyes rested on a rack that was in the changing room. Clothes that would normally have resided in safety among its fellow branded mates (even ordered into a conforming color code of greens on one rack, blue tops on another) are thrown together with their rivals, both in brand and color. Purple tops were strewn across yellow bras and patterned skirts hung beside a fishnet neon blue blouse. Yet her jaded color opinions didn't get in the way and instead of ignoring the mess as she always did, grew intrigued by the harmonious blending of colors that was taking place before her eyes.   If there was a rational explanation to all this, he would be able to think up of one. Perhaps he might come up with a mathematical equation. The light grew dimmer and night came. The lights in the mall never faltered. The air conditioning purred and consistently generated the cool air that created the perfect temperature for shoppers and exhibits.She thought about what he might say if she told him all that had happened to her today but he was an ocean a few thousand miles away. There will be no one to return home to except the fat tabby cat.

       sullen sky.  your coattails leave a trace, a wet path across the varnished parquet.  it is so cold.  The time to rouse oneself is already passed. That is not true but no one believes in themselves  anymore.  With my brown jacket i wrap my body, my soul, intent on walking these streets to find life for heaven's sake.  it is too cold  for this time of the year or so the complaint of everyone goes.  But i cannot help what i dream, what compels me to wander and journey for all the passing of time.   Surely even the grave cannot hold  me for my dwelling place lies not in its grim predictions and gloom.  Few find the narrow path, fewer  remain on it and reach your throne.  But where the coldest winds  dwell, where the sleeping giants lie, where the heights reign over mortal lives, there I will journey. I will chart the wilderness of the heart, and once entering into death  will only pass it by  and gain entrance to my father's heart.

       two individuals are sitting on separate tables, talking on their mobile phones.    theflat-hatter : phew i'm back!  sillygirlinred : as if that meant anything...  theflat-hatter : glad that you're happy to know i'm back. By the way Jason had...  sillygirlinred : well i can't help you. You jolly well know the answer already please.   theflat-hatter : yes that's pretty sad isn't it. He was so obstinate in burying old blackie by our favourite park bench. Yeah! You bet people were staring...   sillygirlinred : If you ever dare to come here, i'll... I'll just be super pissed. Don't you ever dare... Don't you ever dare! (presses the engage button)   theflat-hatter : woah... no nothing just someone at the next table. Anyway, thanks for offering to drop by later. Jason would be really appreciative. Oh wait a minute you know what! you can bring calista too! Yeah I know...    sillygirlinred is trying to read a book but she is visibly upset. She looks up from her book with the book still in her hand and is lost in her thoughts.     sillygirlinred : i wish she's here...  theflat-hatter : so it's a date. I'll see you later then and thanks dear. thank you so much.    sillygirlinred stands up and walks away.  theflat-hatter takes his hat off and looks exhausted.     theflat-hatter : i wish i was a million miles away. What's new?

        silly girl in red  Can you smell the air? that dampness... almost a woody smell, moist wood of hollow tree trunks... it has just rained and so it smells... so good.   boy with one shoe  it probably smells exactly the way you've described it. I can't smell it coz I used to  smoke alot.   silly girl in red  but how does smoking dull your senses?   boy with one shoe  it probably burns out your taste buds or your nose sensing abilities. something has been fried, short-circuited. but the sensations will come back when the new cells are grown...   silly girl in red  that is provided you don't smoke again.   boy with one shoe  yes... i may get my senses back.    silly girl in red  sorry if this seems rude... of course you don't have to give me an answer if you don't want to... when are you going to get another shoe?  boy with one shoe  my romantic inclinations towards individualism and selfhood would never allow me to get another shoe for my bare foot... i was just kidding.    silly girl in red  some days you're so full of shit.   boy with one shoe  i know... make that every day though. it sucks to go without a shoe.   silly girl in red  so?   boy with one shoe  so what?  silly girl in red  you know about the other shoe.  boy with one shoe  oh yes. well never. i'm never going to get another... because if i do that, i might lost my sense, my sensitivity. with one foot covered i gain speed to transverse this world but the other without covering slows me down because of the occasional intensity of sensations. you know like how brick pavements get so heated up that you literally feel like you're walking on fire like those kavali figures?  silly girl in red  really. do those kavali bearers walk across fire too.   boy with one shoe  i don't know but that's beside the point. i was just trying to say it's a bloody hot pavement. Anyway, so my feet without covering slows me down but not completely; Just enough to let me savour the sensations but at the same time keep a reasonable pace when walking...   silly girl in red  i don't know. you're just too lazy. you've probably broke and can't afford a pair of new sneaks. you're just ...   boy with one shoe  the boy with one shoe  silly girl in red  no. You're just crazy.

       the depressing stories. once, twice,  you're pushing my patience buttons and it works.  But start feeling trigger happy by going the distance for four and so on, you're really asking for ... what? applause? limelights? some validation of your already pathetic existence on earth?   Perhaps i'm not being understanding here.  rude and callous, i know i can see it from my words. But i beg you to just be still for my  sanity, for our friendship, for troubled lives that charge through the lines  and demand nothing more of the silence. This is not a vacuum of  revolution you must fill  but a quiet movement  in this present that no one really understands.

        A cup of rose tea   Buds of roses unceremoniously thrown into the cavernous belly of porcelain. I think of every coming pleasure with a thought that never unwinds itself. A long, drawn out desire plays itself out in my daily actions of filling my teapot with rose buds, applying the pressure to release the hot water, waiting and waiting.  one day i waited far too long. i returned to see a stain of red at the base of my cup.  it was like a piece of red string tied around my finger from my grandfather's funeral.  The desire for life always plays itself out and the day  is already spent.

       How curious  the words that  twisted into this misshapened mass - a troubled conscience.   I was on hot pursuit after the very scent of God.  My emotions left a sweet trail for an enlightened mind to follow.   I climbed every rung of the  ladder confidently till the phone rang.   Then it was that I lost the presence of mind, He slipped out of my fingers as I groped in the sudden darkness.   Finding no outlet  for my frustration, I grappled  with my loss with an understanding  of a child and returned  my gaze upon myself.   (cont'd)

       Confusion swept me  off my feet and dear Lord, I followed the best of what I knew.  Emails, lunch, a spot of tv. Work, another stain from the swirling palette.   Forgive me Lord. I am a child that can't grow on her own.  Who knows why the body matures? How a child suddenly speaks when the last you saw, a trembling bundle of flesh and undisturbed rest.   Such mysteries confound me and silence indeed  makes wise the foolish.  I will return to You.   Faith guides the hands when eyes corrupted with age fail to perceive.   I will return to You.  Grace cleaves  the desires  of the flesh and through its passage,  your saints will travel  to find You.   I will return to You.  Though my senses fail, still the Hope in my spirit  man will never fail to find You.   I know how to continue this journey in darkness.  Let no other lights lead me astray.

       Reading  urlLink Anita Shreve's latest novel  on love relationships and reminiscing, i walk away after the first few pages like walking away from a departmental store coz they just don't have your size. What is it with reminiscing? Can you remember how the flames lick up the drapes and the logo of the rolling stone flashing across your mind? Can you remember the divine being of fire that breathed in the entire hotel and spit out its ashes? You're not reminiscing and I hate to be fooled by someone who tries to strike a pose and past off as being spontaneous, pontificating proliferative shit.   Nothing against A.S. Nothing against the world.   Because now i'm going to reminisce. Yes I am and despite all of my misgivings for this pretentious activity, I will pursue this till my brain begins to put up the sign for a rest room break. Believe me that i am a romantic; Believe me that i still believe in enthusiasm. I write because it's about time to have a record about these things. How do you know when it is the time? When you realise that although you're twenty-three, there will always never ever be the right time for writing. You start it, get the engine running or stall and wait till someone fills your gas. Will someone come? Best not to take the gamble. It's time for life to present itself even if i don't understand or realise half of the time of what i'm really saying. That's your job. All i do is write.   So there i was a 10 year old waiting at a bus-stop. i've wandered from the shopping mall nearby and have completely lost sight of the mother, the mother ship or my mum who I only meet occasionally. Her absence is always excused by my grandparent's explanations as they sought to pacify me with the television whenever i could not shut the hell up. Or when i was in that silent, pensive mood, they would try to speak to me.   "she's gotta work boy. She's working now so she can buy you things. She can buy you food and the clothes that you wear right now... also the television! See your favourite." "Where is mum" "Ssshh... She's working hard now... you go watch tv and then later when ah gong is back, we'll go out for a nice dinner ok" "Will she be back soon" "tsk. No more questions now. You watch he-man finish and keep quiet. If you are good, we will eat mcdonalds."  Asking questions can be irritating. I can understand that now especially if this kid bugs you everyday with the same thing and there's no way out even if it's as simple as walking out of the house. He-man always looked kinda orange to me. I return to the living room even though he-man is getting boring. I was ten. I was waiting for the vampire flicks to kick in at 10pm where i will watch secretly from under the covers, my ah gong just half a meter away who didn't care if i couldn't get to sleep.   "You can't sleep ah" "Yeah"  And vampires would jump to the ringing of the bell, being controlled by the taoist priest who had pasted yellow slips of paper on their foreheads. my ah-gong ate his peanuts and burped with his beer; His back always to me which was comforting at times coz when it really got scary, i'll think ah gong is protecting me. He won't let them come out of the tv.   When waiting for my mum to pick me up in her little red car after piano lessons, I will find the ixoras and pinch at the little stem to draw out the sweet liquid. i will wait some more after the ixoras have exhausted me and just let my gaze run with the cracks in the concrete bench. i'll find a rhythm to beat out on the hand rails with paint flaking from them. If i could get an edge, i'll pull out a rill of paint and spend more time observing the ants, negotiating through the bumpy terrain of hand rails.  Sometimes there was a huge spider web on the tree nearby, but i never got to see the spider. And after all this, i'll just wait some more. Maybe the spider will appear.   But there will be a loud and discordant noise of impatient honking and i'll know, it could only be mum.

        our poem of silence   how did we come to this a consensus to hold the peace, to uphold the last shred of civility and  then we find ourselves returning, to values we thought were abandoned, to choruses we thought were worn thin.   before we know it, we are at words again. the incomplete sentences finishing their end rhymes, the show of forceful morality upon the break of tears.   so let's finish our game.  before we begin,  shall we come to a consensus - again?

        1 Corinthians 15:10  But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.   taken out of context.  i stand at the edge of the pool, toeing the water, dipping my ankles, shuddering from the cold:  Not miles but mere metres before me. i don't understand olympians with their ostensibly strong and rippling muscles, blades that dance across the  surface while, my body  continually breaks the ice and lets the cold in.  i stand in a pink trimmed, sequinned black suit, pale as sickness.  one moment the plunge, that will end this monologue. one more moment the plunge from they say, darkness into light, buoyancy, the thrill of going back and forth while your spirit races to  the finish line.  Just one more moment to be more or less human: But for the grace of God.

       For your love, i would do anything.  Just to see the smile upon your face [Stevie Wonder - For your love]  This heart overflows of all the things You have placed inside of it. Your love, Your deeds  of old and new, Your words, Your promises of things unseen: they overwhelm me with their possibilities.   With simple thoughts, I make known Your miracles. Of babes nursed in Your arms, Of elders held in Your embrace, how time and place gather all in this single moment  to live in everlasting burnings, incendium amoris.   But give care to the young men.  Where the sweet flame burns, let your eyes always return.  Let your eyes relive the beginning and the end. The cares of the battle   rest much easier in the brightness of  His coming.   So once more oh God, let Your love come down to flesh and bone, to  men whose spirits are  easily dismayed. Then,  new wine shall be made, new songs shall be sung, to Your praise and everlasting glory. For no deed shall ever be as great, as those that Your love has inspired.

        a little poetry of our own   a little poetry of our own:  the gestures of humour circle around him like a glow, a light that makes the  darkness easier to bear.  her maiden song on performance for all to recognise  except herself as she slips away from the applause.  His enthusiasm that underscores a life of wearying yet patient,  exacting perfection.  we write our humanity with an inkless brush, and it seems as if all the strokes go awry; especially when  foot steps falter, the cheers die down, and the spots of darkness bore out sight from straining eyes.  we will never know how and when our poem ends. The twists and turns of the line are not restrained by a punctuation mark.  our little poems: who can draw figures out of them as our bodies intertwine in dance and song?
