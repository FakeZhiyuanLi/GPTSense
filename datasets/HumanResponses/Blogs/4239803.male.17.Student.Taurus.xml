      hey, today i have a nice tennis training! enjoy it.. right after tennis, i played bball.. although i play quite lousy (it's real! i'm not trying to be humble! haha..), it's nice! yeah.. i guess i have a enjoyable days in my secondary school.. days with my classmates, six bros, my female gangs are really really wonderful.. though we have some disagreement sometimes, bonds are still as concrete.. but now in jc, life is different! i think i took the days in secondary school for granted.. that's life! haha.. anyway, jc life isnt easy.. i'm release from school at 5 everyday.. subjects are getting difficult! i'm tryin my best to cope.. there are friends whom have help me and there is a friend that look down on me that implies that i studies so hard and yet i still fail my test, should be separated from the the better students in tutorial lesson, hope that his own cloassmate retain etc.. though i may not study smart, at least i try to put in as much effort as i can.. the kind of feeling isnt good.. the friend of mine though that she's good.. ya, i admit that she can be better than me and even do better than me in test and exam.. cant stand the big ego in her.. *sigh* it's okie! i shall work hard and prove to her that i can do it and will do well in the coming promotion exam! i din get to meet this kind of people in my secondary school days.. no one ever look down on me before.. it's a kind of experience and motivation to study even harder! i will remain postitve.. until one day, till i cant stand and flare up.. then i'll tell u what happen.. =)
