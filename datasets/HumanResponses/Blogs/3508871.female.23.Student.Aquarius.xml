      I have been craving for SUSHI since I got to Hood River. There's no decent asian restaurants here either, there's about two chinese restaurants but they serve GREASE! hhaha so yeah, go figure. Well today, Travis and I have planned to go car shopping,location: just outside of Portland. ONe thing I learned! Boy those car dealers! They freaked the hell out of us! Pushing us till no end to buy a car! Ok enough of my exclamtion marks!!!! hahahahahah. Finally we got out of that place and went straight to TODAI RESTAURANT located in Portland, ORegon. Which is just an hour's drive away from Hood River. The car dealer's place was just 10 minutes away from Portland anyways. I was absolutely hungry, we were negotiating for two hours...travis was nagotiating, i was just sitting there just couldn't believe what comes out of that dealer's  mouth. Alright when we got to TODAI, server told us that TODAI will be closing in 1 hour and 5 minutes. Man, I was like, yea give it to me, I am ready for this race....hahaha. Todai is a buffet Japanese restaurant and apparently it is pretty famous. So you can imagine, I am a sushi freak...I was just all over the place! AHI, MAckeral, Cali roll...yellowtail,tokyo ramen...and more! boy I was eating everything...20 minutes later, Travis and I rubbed our tummies...WE ARE GETTING THERE! So yeah, ANDREW...YOU MISSED OUT MAN! TODAI CONQUORS! Wish we could take some pictures of this place and send them to all my friends. hahaha...well kids...next time. We finished off our meal with CREPES. PHOO WEE, by that time our crepes were deveoured...I felt my belly was about to burst out into the public! Yeah imagine that, would not be a good sight. "People will be like, what the heck is wrong with this asian chic?! Oh it is one of those again, who just can't handle pressure when it comes to a place like TODAI"    Well everyone, since Japanese food are usually expensive everywhere you go. But TODAI is definitely "THE PLACE" to go for JAPANESE FOOD especially when you're a SUSHI FREAK and you're still a STUDENT who just wants to pay cheap and eat LOTS!   End of FOOD REVIEW...till next time....TODAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIII......oh i mean BAAANNNNNNNZAAAAAAAIIIIIIIII!

      All I can say is WOW, big time. My first climbing experience and I thought I've never survived this one. Travis and Walter decided to go to Lyle, (that's across the river from Hood River, and its in Washington) yesterday evening about 6pm for a short climb. All I heard was it was going to be alot of fun and it is by the water. I kind of got the idea when Travis told me that we will be climbing the walls,alongside the edge of the Columbia Gorge river. I didn't think twice about it, so yeah of course, I was going to go and try this thing out. It was an half an hour drive, with beautiful scenery along the way,even though it was already past 6pm. The sun was still pretty strong but it wasn't hot hot. We arrived, the view was just beautiful, I could see the whole of Columbia gorge, mountains with the sides that has different shapes and sizes, there were tonnes of vegetation, rail road running along side of the gorge. There was nothing in the way blocking this gorgeous view. And we were there to climb.     We got ready, Travis showed me a side that it was much easier to start on, around the level of 5-7, 5-8. Got my shoes on and my chalkball bag secured around my waist. Yeah I was ready to climb. Travis was of course leading me;we both climbed down this edge that lead us down to the river and started traversing at the edge of the river. Not too bad the first move, the rocks had pretty big foot holes and good grip for the hands but as I moved further, it was getting abit tricky. I am still not a very experience climber and at the same time knowing that I am not supported and could just fall easily right into the river...wel yeah, go figure...I WAS BEGINING TO PANIC! The adranaline rush, trying to hold on and figuring out how to move from then on was ridiculous, although I had Travis help showing me the routes to take, I didn't feel very confident in moving. Finally, came to a point where there this big huge protruding rock that I had to go around, with my little experience and lack of technique, I had no way on how to overcome that route problem. Although I wanted so much to try it out but knowing that if I fail to miss grabing on to one of those rocks, I was going to fall right into the water. I did not want my chalk bag to get wet and that would be the end of my climb for the day. The tricky part was getting back up to safety, we stopped at the that protruding rock point and started to climb upward which was at least 5 feet to reaching the top. Took me at least 15 minutes to climb that 5 feet cause there was a point that I needed to really lifted my leg up high to lift myself up to the next foot hole. It was ridiculous, for a not confident me, it took me forever to climbed up. Of course, I did make it in the end, holding on for dear life. Once I reached the top (yeah, solid ground), I was absolutely relieved! I was able to breath again with ease.     yes and that is my story. Will I go back and climb again! HELL YEAH. There's nothing more than to keep doing it again and again, the feeling of beating the river by not falling into it is the best feeling I could get.

      Third day of JUNE and I am still on freaking vacation! Let me tell you something....There are absolutely no good photographers here in Hood River. Can't blame this place, everyone that's good is in the CITY... Anyways, I have a job interview next week with Panzanella, an Italian style bread and sandwich shop in town. Seems like that will be my best bet in getting a good decent summer job. As for the photo place....uhhh well...lets just say, not my type. SO i guess I can say i KNow what it feels like to not have a job and living on what I have...which is almost NOTHING...I NEED MONEY TO PAY BILLS! Hey, who doesn't right. Life is tough....hmm kinda..    Hood River is a quaint little town, where almost everyone knows everyone, business wise. This town is like the Newport of Rhode Island, except that tourist are mostly windsurfers from north south east and west are gathered here to be a bum for three whole months and eat their food from  samplers  supermarkets give out to customers....it is so true! ok I do consider at some point I am a bum right now, but I definitely do not hang out at supermarts waiting for food to be serve! hahhaahha.     I have been trying to start a photo project, I guess I can call it "Summer Life in HR". Been going pretty slow, yeah that's what I mean I am being a bum! And I do have a bit of problem trying to get my films develop, professionally, without getting wrecked at some point, which happened to me!  I will be posting those online at some point this month.

      Finally no more rain in Hood River. Summer BBQ, that's a good thing and that was what Travis and I had last night for dinner with our landlords and a few friends. There was just too much laughter and too much food. One thing that was a killer was the ribs cooked in a crock pot. The best!!!! So tender and juicy. Maybe a little bit better than Andrew's juicy juicy mango. Sorry drew, it was really that good. What else did we have, Oh yeah,BBQ chicken cooked by Donna was excellent, very tender as well... Potato salads,heese bread,baked beans and corn. Delicious...yum yum. Finished off with strawberries on cookies and cream ice-cream. Double yum! hmmm if i do not start my summer training, I am going to be  miss big mama  by mid summer! My summer....well, still waiting to hear about my job at an italian style sandwich store,Panzella...can't remember the exact name just yet. I manage to list a liquor bottle set on ebay today and hoping that would sell, so yeah, if anyone is interested in collecting liquor bottles...please check it out on ebay...website: Old fashion Liquor bottle set that comes with 5 matching shot glass..so copy and paste this link on to your browser  http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=6100784320&sspagename=STRK%3AMESE%3AIT&rd=1   Been out taking some pictures, on a square format camera Zenza Bronica 6X6 size.

      Have been craving to be in Oregon since January, just because the weather in Connecticut has been giving me dreadful headaches. So...this is my first week in my temporary summer home, location, Hood River, Oregon. What have I been doing? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Well, except that I am waiting to begin my summer job as a photo assistant and a sales person at small town Hood River. And what I am doing right now? Sitting inside my apartment, wasting my chance to be out on a sunny day for a computer....typing this blog. Yeah, so what, I have nothing else better to do right now. And here I am being influenced by Andrew...in creating this blog. I met Drew at a christmas party...hahaha yeah right....ok it was christmas break in year 2001? Ok one of those Christmas' where no one can remember anything that had happen except just clips of it....hahahahah So Drew, my anime friend....who is crazily in love with animes and also ripe ripe mangoes! Do ask him about his ripe juicy mangoes, it is his most favourite fruits in the world. Anyways, Drew just told me that he will be getting a new hot rod in a few days or a week? No idea...I guess he will be riding with the wind...time to PARTAY with da BABES in TOOWOOMBA, OZ! hahahahah. Felt so sorry for him being cooped up at home in TOOWOOMBA,OZ! That poor dude has just been dreaming about juicy juicy mangoes,hmmm it is in fact SUmmer here in the US, so JUICY JUICY Mangoes will be an option. Except that it is too cold for those MANGOES to survive in a weather that DREW is experiencing. Well, I dedicate my first posting to DREW, YOU're the MAN!heheheh. NOt sure what...but you're THE MAN! ENJOY IT While you're still YOUNG! oh yeah also guys, check out DREW's BLOG: http://funkmonkee.blogspot.com

      For those of you who have not seen the new Harry Potter, I suggest that you should go check the movie out! yeah. I thought this one was much more interesting than the last, there were more intensity and surprises involved. There was a bit of twist too. Although I have not read JK Rowling's book of this movie, still I thought it was entertaining and fun and certainly funny. Forget that big hit movie Troy, other than those BEEFY boys...it was nothing more than male machoness. I do not think the movie is bad, just a very male hormone movie...and also you may learn the incorectness of the history of Greece...hahaha. I've never taken Greek Mythology but I certainly want to. Till then I can't really tell you what was wrong with that portrayal of history of Greece. Except yeah, I agree with Andrew, Orlando Bloom had a sissy part to that movie. Ok for light hearted comedy..go see SHREK! I thought it was absolutely hilarious putting fantasy characters in Hollywood situation. As usual the DONKEY as annoying as can be but without him that SHREK would not have been a movie..and meet the new character of the movie...PUSS.....ready? da da da.....IN BOOTS! Cute cute pussy cat indeed..hahahha.    So yes everyone  HARRY POTTER  ratings out of 10 :  8.5                      Shrek ratings out of 10:  8  for FUNNY!  Let me know what ya all think, ya?

      So we went climbing today at Horsethief.Yes, Horsethief,yeah...doesn't it sound like someone from long ago must have gotten that name cause they stole all those horses! This little climbing bouldering paradise is located just 30 minutes away car from Hood River, located across the Columbia gorge in Washington. Fun and be prepared for snakes! No sport climbing but just bouldering. Bouldering's tough as this is not my strong area. Bouldering's just hard in general, it is all about having and learing the right technique. When a bouldering problem's being presented to you, just gotta keep working on it till you get it. I was simply kicking myself in the butt partly I didn't have enough upper body strength and that certain mental toughness. Bouldering's a good way to get your technique and especially my head straighten out. Just gotta trust your feet, really push it all out, and toughen it out. Bouldering's also the best way to sharpen your climbing skills before venturing into further sport climbing. When climbing, gotta have that grace and light weight feeling towards your movement, otherwise you would just look like a heavy elephant trying to do the impossible.

I had Thai for lunch, was cheap and good. $7 for Pad Thai and Green Curry chicken combo,a tonne of food. Boy I do miss real Thai food back in Malaysia, ummmmm Tom Yam soup would sound really good right now.

      Saturday--06/12/04, Climbing at Smith Rock, its about an hour and a half's drive away from Hood River, Oregon. We started our journey at 6:30am, so that we could get first in line and to avoid the mid-afternoon sun as much as possible. Weather in the morning was cloudy and abit chilly but it warmed out from 10am onwards and boy did it get hot later! By the time we finished climbing, Travis and me were baked from the sun. Yeah...forgot about SUN BLOCK! Sport climb was what we did and we finished three routes: Nine Gallon Buckets(level:5.9), The Outsider(level:5.9) and Five Gallon Buckets(level:5.8).Interested in Sport Climbing and Traditional climbing? check out SMITH ROCK!

I would like to say this route was a tonne of fun. The first half of the route was pretty easy, started out with large hand holds, towards the middle part of the route it narrows down to really small foot holds and crimpy finger holds. Challenging and a tat bit scary with those crimps. But I FINISHED IT! Yeah baby!  So take a look at this route again: urlLink The Outsider

      Because I AM! Travis and I just got back from seeing the new Michael Moore documentary "FARENHEIT 9/11" I encourage everyone to experience this documentary. Yes yes, I know some of you who think this documentary maybe biased or is heavily biased but hey Moore proved his point and he did a good job in pushing people's button. As for me, I have already known how corrupted Bush Administration has been. Their MOTTO is "DESTROY DESTROY innocent lives cause there's MORE MONEY FOR US" That's what they have been doing, destroying the lives of not only innocent american lives but also lives of innocent IRAQI's of whom have nothing to do with any of this stupid money making scheme! It is all about DA MONEY!!! What i think? BUSH NEEDS TO GO! And you guys know what to do! VOTE HIM OUTTA HERE....and oh yeah do not forget to watch FARENHEIT 9/11. Everyone needs to have their own opinion and for everyone's sake STOP  BUSH!

        First of all,I have not been out doing anything exciting for the past week. Except just sitting my ass right infront of the computer doing my research. Feeling my eyes are conformed to the shape of the computer screen. Well...I am trying to put a project proposal to win the WATSON fellowship. It is actually call the Thomas J.Watson Traveling Fellowships, for any student who will complete degree their requirement for year 2004 and 2005. The purpose of this fellowship is give recipients "an opportunity for a focused and disciplined year of their own devising--a period in which they can have some surcease from the lockstep of prescribed educational and career patterns in order to explore with thoroughness a particular interest", so basically recipients get to go abroad to conduct their research. Isn't that cool? The fellowship continues "fellows have unusual,sustained, and demanding opportunity to take stock of themselves, to test their aspirations and abilities, to view their lives and American society in greater perspective, and, concomitantly, to develop a more informed sense of international concern." So really what they are seeking for, in specifics,  are cadidates who "demonstrate integrity, imagination, strong ethical character, intelligence, the capacity for vision and leadership, the promise of creative achievement and excellence within a chosen field, and the potential for humane and effective participation in the world community." The countries that a candidate picks must not be a country where that individual has spend growing up or been has had alot of first-hand experience. Must be foreign and new. The foundation will also not support projects involving countries that are under watch or unsafe to travel to. That's the brief of the felloship I am trying to apply for. oH yeah it is a nationwide fellowship, so if I do get selected by my college committee, then there will be the foundation's representative will be coming to interview during the school year. Doesn't this sound exciting?      My research project's topic is going to be on Youth and Technology, comparison of those within India and Japan. Concentrating on the specifics, I will be looking more into the communication technology within youth and how and why it is important to the generation of today and the future. Or is communication technology nowadays affecting Youth in a certain way that might evolve into something new and will take affect in society?      Take a look at Japan, youth culture has been one of the biggest influences in lots of businesses in Japan. Youth in Japan are the biggest consumers, "CONSUMERISM" that is the most crucial part of their national identity. For example,  Youth in japan cannot live without their cell phones, they use their cell phones to not only converse but also email and updates on their everyday life. And you know what, you guys be surprise, lots of youth do not even know how to operate a PC! Because there is no need to do so. Yeah, a country that's high in technology, famous in gizmos and gadgets.Go figure...       If you read news about India's economy, globalization is one of their key in improving its country's status and development.  But hey most of you guys know that India is not a rich country like Japan, a country that has no poverty to begin with. From what I've researched there are companies that are trying an outreach program to communities that are poor,such as places that has absolutely no running water, giving children a chance to be educated, that way they can change their lives for the better. As you can see, with this kind of help, it opens up opportunities for the poor. I've read in one of the articles online saying " In order for the rich to profit, the poor has to profit in order for the rich to stay rich,and there is no reverse". India's economy has been growing tremendously with the outsourcing of jobs. IT now becomes the important part of a youth's education.Young children as young as six are being introduced to computers. This creates a middleclass in the society which never really happen before in India. Also the high market of mobile phones comes from youth.      So my questions are these, they are not actually my final ones as I am still doing research and trying to read up on as many resources that I can find.       1. For Japan,How does communication technology influence youth culture of today?     2. How does communication technology helped propogate and define youth culture in Japan?     3. Does the current growing IT and communication tech help creating a youth culture in India?       What I am trying to do is to come up with a specific final topic to compare these two countries. Still in the process of building this project. From my observations so far, I don't see many articles been written much about how technology is influencing youth or how it is important to our today's young generation. And it would be great if I can get to research and experience this first hand.        That is all for now. So wish me luck and I will keep everyone posted as I go along. If anyone has any ideas to help me narrow this down, please feel free to post a comment.    tata....

      This is a bit of a late news but it did only happen last weekend. Travis and I got invited to James' house just 30 minutes away from Portland for a BBQ party. Ended up that we met a new group of friends who invited us for another BBQ party the next day. Yeah, we were BBQed out! We had so much fun weekend, from jacuzzi to a game of taboo craziness. What's Taboo? Its like charade but instead of silence, you describe the word in a way so your group can guess the word. It was fun and boy we were crazy! Considering almost everyone was pretty buzzed out. The next day BBQ was done at another friend of mine, Krista's. And we got to stay and watch fireworks, which was a amazing.

       urlLink    Just this weekend, went out with a few other friends to French's Dome, just behind Mt.Hood for some climbing. This is a 5.8 difficulty, it was alot of fun. I manage to finish a 5.10b, that really took every single energy out of me.

      It has been a while....since I wrote anything in here. First I was lazy and second...don't think there was anything interesting enough to report to the world. I have been living in a few exciting moments this past week. Just this last weekend, I decided to drive back to Seattle again for a last minute blast with my friends. I finally got my hair done, some say I look more korean and some say Japanese... hahaha can't say I don't like any of the comments... Did some heavy cosmetic shopping at Nordstrom, almost bought the entire line from Stila cosmetics recommended by Ramon who was my make-up artist at that time. He did a stunning job on me and I couldn't resist for not going out partying that night. Ok enough of self complement. But I did had an excellent time on Saturday night. Had a few drinks and danced the night away at a club call Medusa in downtown Seattle. We were all kind of trash that night, but couldn't stop laughing. I have to say that weekend thanks to all the Indos I have met especially Bimo, my good girlfriend Bow from Thailand, where can I ever find such two wonderful friends?! Also not forgetting Sharon the Tsing Tao girl....crazy lass indeed, never seen anyone so wild! hahahah. Glad to have met her.    Anyways on Monday, Travis has asked me if I would like to go gliding....and I am like Yeah...lets go, without knowing what it actually was about.  Alright when we got there, obviously a glider is just a plane without an engine and in order to get a lift up, needs a tow plane to pull it up into the sky. I thought it was fun but I wish I wasn't so  quizzy. nah I did not puke...if the pilot did some extreme dives...I probably would. But told him not to as I am not that use to flying like this.  So yeah, here's a picture below, pretending that i am ok...hahaha and for more detail story, check out  urlLink Travis'blog .

       urlLink    Went for a gliding experience. Pretending that I was in a good shape but actually....I felt very quizzy after taking off...yeah, motion sickness.but thank goodness I did not do what I am not suppose to....p*ke. It was definitely an amazing experience, just to be able to see such wonderful view of Hood River from the top. For the rest please check out  urlLink Travis'Blog
