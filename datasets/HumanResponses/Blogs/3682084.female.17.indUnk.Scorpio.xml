      i am still at summers and sadie is here now... she is driving me insane.. i mean i love her so much but she is never her self... shes got this fake accent and it drives me insane she thinks she everything i hate people like that! she always tries to be like some one that shes not... she talks crap behind peoples backs then goes off and is their best friend... just like her friend randi she always said how much she hates her and then once school is out randi is her best friend! gr....... well i really need to get my anger out and stuff and it bugs me that she is in modeling because she has never been into the way she looks or ne thing she is just trying to fit in or thats what i think i mean i could be wrong but gr..... i just need more than a week away from her or she needs help or something then when she was at modeling she got pictures taken of her and stuff then i came to sommers and i thought that i was getting my pictures taken of me and i thought that was because sadie was in modeling but then when sadie came here sadie got to take so many pictures :( i feel like the odd one out... but sommer asked me if i wanted more taken and i said no because i dont want to use any more time up because we still have to make our movies and we only have like a week and a half left and we want to make 2 movies then a lot of different skits... sadie always says to me when we get mad that she thinks that sommer and i are the favorites and that makes me so mad then when sadie gets here she tries to be this goody goody grrrrrr well i am gonna go and i think that i am over chris i think i still love brett and brett is the only one that i have ever told i love them and ment it !
