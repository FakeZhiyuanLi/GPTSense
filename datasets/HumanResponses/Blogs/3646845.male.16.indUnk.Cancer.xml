      Did nothing today.  Actually, i walked to the kitchen around 1, and to the backdoor once.  Awsome stuff.  Hours upon hours of CS, time flew.  I'm still liking this summer stuff now, it'll wear off.  After mutti's arrival home i ate some din and headed off for bowling.  Bowled a 612, which is uber good for me at playmor.  I seem to suck there with my low avg or 186.  Might be good to some of you readers, but not really for me, thats what i had last year :(:(.  Anywho i think willis seta and joe are coming 2mEEr to save me from bordum.  Should be fun.  2mEEr = the last time i bowl for about 5 days.  For any1 that really knows me, you would know that is an INCREDIBLY long time for me.  Hopefully the carpets will let me bet with them again (so i can take their mula).  Uhh...poker friday i think, let me know peeps.  Sunseri is the only hardcore cat i know is in fo SHO, so holla.  TY, your "pal" nub-it.

      Changed my mind, i'll continue blogging.  I just wont really speak the WHOLE truth, just speak what i know wont offend.  I'll walk away from the experience with just a little more knowledge and wisdom.  And remember kidz, Truth Hurts, and is better left untold.

      This will be my last post.  Its caused me more trouble than i bargain for.  The truth is not meant to be told, for all those who dont know that already.  If u have a problem, hide it, and dont ever make it obvious.  Thanks for reading all of the few things i have been able to post, its been fun.  Sometimes i think that things are unfair, but thats only the way that things are meant to be.  O well is all i can say.  I'm gonna go now, lay down and rethink.  Thanks again for reding my life adventures and opinions for the while that you did.  Your Friend, Wiseass Spoiled little boy, Alan Davis.  O yes, if any of you decide to make one of these blogs, make sure that everyone u think might react badly to your postings is blocked/ cant have access to it.  Its deadly.  Ta Ta for now.

      Poker tonight, yes, the second week in a row.  I'm glad, its addicting and i have a lot of fun doing it.  But anyway,  i lost miserably in the main game.  100 bucks going to the winner, most people we had yet.  Lots of fun tho.  So i walk over to the side game that dave got started.  And wouldnt ya know it, my luck changed. Flipped 180 degrees and i won.  50 bucks or something.  Overall profit for the night is 30.  Atleast my confidence in my poker playing hasnt completely vanished.  No fireworks 2nite, i know whats better between fireworks and poker, i'm no fool.  Not much besides that today, just an average day.  And thats a good thing i suppose.  I'm probably not gonna do much 2mEEr either, again, a good thing.  I'm sick of being alone :-\.  <3.  CS with seta now, another highlight of my days.  Lat0r cats, and GG willis, nice playing.  -Me

      Went over joe's 2day around noonish.  Did the usual over there, some gaming, food, then some more gaming.  Left around 5 to come home, ate dinner and headed off to bowling with the one and only...steve.  While there, we notice some girls that were almost impossible to guess at.  Where they 12...or 17?  Did they have their little 8yr old bros with them...or were they banging them?  Questions that will never be answered.  Although i must say, even if the girls were 12...i would.  ;).  So then, as if that guessing game wasnt fun enough, i look to our right.  It appears that some drunk guy was messing with this dude and his g/f.  Poor ppl, they were there to have a little fun with oneanother, and they were greeted by an old guy.  Everytime the girl threw the ball, he seemed to say "Well astleast u din get a gutter HAHHAHAHAHA", even if she did get a gutter.  O well, maybe her b/f get some sex 2nite b/c that old guy made her horney.   .  So we're surrounded by...well...idiots i suppose.  Unless those girls WERE 16-17...in which case...call me.  Strange looking around and thinking, wow...maybe i am the only normal person.  Negative, everyone is normal in their own way.  The old drunk guy prolly that he ROCKED, and i'm gonna let him think that, cuz it makes him feel better.  The girls liked to dunk their head in makeup b4 they left.  Awsome, keep up the good work, keep everyone guessing.  I guess my point is, everyone is funny, when your watching from a far.  Its just that they're probably thinking something cra-z about u 2.  However i am glad i get to go out in public and get a good laf at a old drunk guy.  Thats all for now, back to my music playing and CS i suppose.  Thxz for reading, and i hope this isnt one of those blogs that just make you bored and more stupid just by reading.  Later all, -Alan

Thats all for today, no opinion or comments...just my life cut and dry.  GG.  O yes, the title.  I got paid for 3 lawn mowings, and got 28939932902 mexican dollars = 70 american.

      Rough day today.  I was lying around till about 7...then slept.  Got a call in the morn about the new garage door installation.  8am scheduled time.  So when he gets it installed and leaves, i had to bed for the "night"(around 9).  Woke up at 3:30...watched russian roulette (sp?) and headed off to mow.  I wish the sun didnt pick on me...causing heat to the point i'd rather break my arm then mow.  Bowling...620 :-\...not good not bad...again.  Poker stars and music again 2nite...i'm up for a change.  Everyday my life goes on a track.  Nothing changes. I talk to the same people everyday, almost at the same time.  Pathetic little life i run here, but i like it for now.  No good.  Thats my news for now. "Thats the address...alright...wiseass?"  o and one more thing.  I'm lying to u. GG.  -Me

      Lots and lots O-kegeln 2day.  I stressed my knee and my elbow, guess i was just kinda outta it/tired.  I woke up around 1pm 2day after not getting to bed until 5am. Its insomniac, but not.
I havent been on the comp much during the day, explaining why i always post these things at 1 in the morn.   Mom decided to schedule an appt. with some ppl for 8am 2morow. How nice.  No wonder my love for her flourish's.  No sleep for me 2nite; if i did go to bed i'd just have to wake up in a couple hours for her appt.  Boring day today.  Hope I find something to do soon.  O good news.  Hankey/Dave/Gerner has decided to host poker this friday.  Now i only have to wait 7 days...instead of 14.  O boy.  Thats all for now i guess, not much to talk about today.  -ALan DAvis

      I just got back from Ohio today.  I was greeted by my report card.  My GPA has dropped 1 full point over the last year...i suppose its because i'm getting smarter.  Actually...caring less is my problem.  2.8 i got.  Interesting.  With my 16th birthday just around the corner, this report card is nothing but bad.  Looks like i wont hit the road driving till i'm 18.  Shway.  O well...atleast with my permit gone, the only thing left to take away from me is...nothing.  Which is a good thing.  Ohio was boring...i slept for hours.  G-ma is in Japan now, hopefully she brings me back some crackah's...i <3 japanese crackah's lol.  No plans for the rest of the night, prolly CS poker and music, like always.  BTW...for those who care...i got a 2.8 or this 9 weeks, 3.1 overall this year...and cumlitive, i have no idea.

      poker 2nite.  God damn sunseri couldnt have gotten much luckier...shtupped me over.  Ugh.  Still <3 tho.  Not much happened in my world 2day.  Mainly excited all day that i have poker, the new highlight of my every other week.  Wasnt the same w/o matty H...i missed his domination.  Mowed 2day...30 bux for a 50 min job.  Not bad i guess...paid for poker atleast.  As much as i love summer...i must admit i kinda miss school.  It keeps me busy instead of sitting around watching TV all day.  We'll see what happens.  I should start doing these b4 1 am.  Hope dad is haveing fun at the big apple...LAF.  Good time with t3h peeps 2nite.  I'm off 2 ohio in about 4 hours...so i'll be updating this on sunday i suppose.  G-ma is off to japan.  O boy.  I've been missing the good things in life and only looking at the bad.  Bad call...silly nub-it.  Everything doesnt have to be serious, and i dont need to be as uptight as i am.  I miss the people i have learned to love over the years (in a un-gay way). lol.  I'm looking forward to driving, not for the ability to drive, but to see and revisit things i like.  Baltimore is outta the question this summer...stuck here the whole time.  Dad (as stated above) is in NY.  I guess i could stay with "aunt TT" for awhile, but wont be as fun or th same without dad.  I figured i was gonna miss him.  Hasnt been but 2 days and i already do.  Good company.  If your reading this, hope to c u soon.  Thats the news for now.  Much love for my peeps, u've kept me sane over the years.  -Your Friendly Neighborhood Alan

      Got to sleep pretty late last night and was greeted this morning by an AWSOME fone call.  Not really.  Some asshole decides to call my home fone at what?...9am.  Good move smart guy.  Thxz for not calling at 8...<3.  So now (with my 4 hours of sleep) i'm walking around like a zombie listening to music...even played some CS with seta.  When i did get to sleep...my dear sweet mommie came in and screamed for no reason to get me up...thats <3.  Nothing all day besides that.  Mowed and fed those god damn fish for the LAST time.  Noice.  Ashlee Simpson has a nice BOD and i cant stand Venus.  If your hormonally excited(I cant say "horny"...kids read this) and u know it clap your hands. *Claps hands*.  I'm off to go lift and then sleep.  I VANT YOU.

      Won 9 buX 2nite of t3h "carpets" bowlin.  Shot 620 :-\...went out to lunch with dad...last time for awhile.  Long while.  Besides that...just another boring day of nothing.  6 Hours of radio listening...and some occasional RATM.  O boy.  I'm going more and more cra-z living day to day.  Only a select few know why...and i'd hear a lot of shit if i told u on this site.  Lemme get this straight.  Your cra-z, i'm not Your wrong, I'm right.  Ty.  No need for this to turn into a hate ceremony i suppose.  Although in time...most likely twill be.  

How can u have your pick when i have nothing to choose from.  Damn you.

      Well, 2mEEr i'll be sixteen, since i'm updating late its already saturday.&nbsp; I'm practically middle age already.&nbsp; I figure a combination of my fat, ankle broke, bad ears, and a fuXed up elbow...i'm halfway already.&nbsp; The only thing big about this b-day is the fact i can take a test starting 2mEEr which allows me to be behind the wheel.&nbsp; Thats&nbsp;nutz really.&nbsp; I really dont even have to know what a brake is...and i can be on the road.&nbsp; Heads up.&nbsp; Not much happened today.&nbsp; Mom got glasses at like 2pm...and i had to go.&nbsp; First time i've left my house b4 6:30pm in a long time.&nbsp; Had to mow sharons yard...which is always fun.&nbsp; Her yard isnt that big, but for those who mow, its worse than a big yard.&nbsp; Its one with ghey hillz and huge holes in the middle of no where.&nbsp; I hate it, but hey, it pays the bills.&nbsp; I guess thats it for now.&nbsp; I like to think of my life as being a bit more exciting.&nbsp; It has, however, been proven time and time again that it isnt.&nbsp; And i still like it.&nbsp; NOICE.&nbsp; <3 h4x...and i'm off to bed.&nbsp; Farewell. - Me

      It seems I cant stop playing poker.  I can stop hosting, but just cant stay away from the game.  Played thursday, friday, and now 2day, which is monday.  Those three days, i'm up a total of like...25 bucks.  Better than being down i suppose.  Not much to say today cuz i'm a bit tired.  Later Cats.  ALn.

      Woke up early again today. Helped with the side of the house again, and actually completed...which is nice.  Then i laid around for awhile, went to Sam's club and fell asleep.  Woke up only to go to Keith's party (turning the big FIVE-OHH).  Cosmic bowling and sitting around.  Back now, and ready for bed.  So chow for now.  I'm gonna sleep in 2mEEr and then go to poker @ some kids house i dont even know.  Wish meh luck.  John's G-pa gave me 20 bucks today for basically holding a door for him and carrying some rolls.  <3 him...and poker is paid.  Yipp-E.  Thanks For Reading - Me

      Today was spent doing nada all day.  Mutti was put in a bad mood b/c of some mishap...never a good thing.  I basically attempted to sleep all day while watching re-runs of NewlyWeds and the ashley simpson show.  Good stuff...let me tell ya.  Won 5 bux in poker last night after collins took the main game.  A cruel and unjust way to basically take mula off collins, but i guess i won still :-\.  I was rushed to leave

      My life is a blank sheet of paper.  Has been for awhile.  I COULD say like "placed right foot in front of left, then breathed".  Bowling was played - The Usual...Poker was won - Unusual but good.  And thats it.  For my dad, i appologize that i dont tell you my every blink and every step.  I ask myself if I care...if not...i assume no one else does.  Fun tonight, the break in poker has begun.  I'm in for others hosting, but i'm out of the hosting world for awhile.  Sorry to all those who plan on my religious weekly event, we'll think of something.  Welp (if thats a word) thats it.  Thanks for reading, I know your hanging off your seat right now due to excitment.  GG Dave, and NT T.  Lat0r

      Been rather busy for the last couple of days.  Did stuff to atleast try to help out most of the day on saturday.  Then UBER tired @ night after sitting down for a 3 hour movie.  So sunday I get up with not much to do.  I dont really remember what i did...but i do remember that around 7pm my mom asked if i wanted to go to Ohio.  I had nothing else to do, so i went.  Just got back 2day, where i had to give steve some chips and a CD and then prepare for bowling (shower, chillax, etc.).  Fun stuff.  I think i finally did it.  My elbow is Officially FUBAR.  It might be time to break from bowling for a few weeks.  Will i commit uicide b/c of this?...Most Likely.  Sucks that i fuXed up my elbow.  Bad technique on my part, this wouldnt happen to some1 "good". I Bowled a 233, and 209, and then my elbow officially broke, and threw a one-forty something.  Heres my towel.  *Throws it*. We'll c what goes down.  Came home tonight and had to feed the fish and lift.  Lifting is pointless unless u do more weight than u think you can handle.  Remember that kids.  Tomorrow i plan to do nothing, which is cool by me.  2mEEr begins the WSOP.  I'm pumped...9pm on ESPN.  Not much else to say really, just my normal life with a 6 hour driving trip to and from Ohio thrown in the middle of it.  To think, there are only 2 things that i think i do OK in this world.  Poker, and Bowling.  It occured to me that i havent won poker in while, excluding that side game at daves, and now my elbow is broke.  So I lose at poker, and i cant bowl all that well anymore.  Whats left?...Time to find a new hobby i suppose.  As always thanks for reading - "MEH".

      I'm giving up the every other week-ly poker thing.  Why?...I'm not really sure.  Guess I'm mainly tired of having to round people up.  "Coming to poker on friday?" is no longer an issue for me, and i feel better already.  But 2nite was fun.  I can definatly tell things are declining.  Not as many laughs and good times as usual, although still fun.  I think others are getting burnt out on weekly poker as am I.  I do <3 poker, and i can play all the time.  I suppose i just want more at risk then 10 bucks, maybe some new compitition.  I lost tonight, again.  Only went down 5 buX tho, thanks to sunseri ;).  <3.  Dave's hosting next week, and then the first off week in poker for awhile.  I had a bowl of ceral, 4 waffles, and a ham sandwich 2day.  How do i manage to stay so fat?...I dont know.  I'm glad its over for now.  Poker that is.  And here is the weekend, the worst part of the week -_-.  Good playing tonight for those who came.  I find myself wondering if there is hope.  Lifting, DDR, and running, etc.  Nothing.  Luck is gone, and i'm dried up.  Almost 16, meaning...well...nothing.  You can feel my excitment i trust.  Good Night and good playing, maybe again someday in the future.  Farewell.

      I didnt post yesterday b/c nothing happened.  Such an exciting life i lead.  I bowled, shooting a 629...not good not bad, the usual.  Today i cleaned up downstairs for poker 2mEEr, exciting stuff.  Headed off to the bowling alley 2nite to throw and few and perhaps some cards. Fun stuff.  I need THE cd or a copy of the following CD's: The Black Album, D12 World.  I dont wish to spend cash to buy them and quite frankly this illigal d/l-ing stuff is getting harder and harder.  Lemme know if u have them so i can burn them.  I give u 58 cent.  Posting early because i'm not gonna feel like it lat0r.  Wont bb from AMF til' late, then 2day is lifting day.  O joy.

      Well as we all have noticed, summer is coming to a quick close.  Limited time to just be alone and do nothing all day.  This week i'm not really doing much.  I got my permit though, which is good.  I start actual classes for driving on thursday.  Then i have friday as my last day off.  Got bowling, a trip to baltimore, and my dear sweet mommy is off all next week.  Having a permit is not really what i thought it'd be.  My mom thinks i need this class in order to drive @ all.  Its nice knowing i CAN drive, but i most likely wont be for awhile.  The job is good.  Its exactly what i expeced i guess...a whole lot of nothing.  But hey, i get paid for it.  I got 22 hours or so in this week, not bad for my first week.  I just thought i'd update incase anyone is interested  .  As always thanks for reading

      Well i got the permit in and everything, and now i have the job.  I started yestrday working a 7 hour shift. 4-11.  It was surprisingly exactly what i expected.  Which IS a good thing.  I sat around and pretty much did nothing.  An ally of my steve showed me how to do everything, what i have to do, etc.  Then after that 20 min training session, i did pretty much nothing.  AND got paid for it.  I've found a decent job i plan on keeping until college atleast.  However in this job, i realize what some people are truly like.  There are some strange ones, and it seems they flock to the bowling alley.  I guess thats it, been mostly sitting around here doing nada.  Wish me luck in this glory job.  Thanks for reading - Me

      Well i went for that job interveiw i mentioned in my last post. I got the job, but cant start working until i get to the school and complete the workers permit thingy. I only have an app for the permit now it turns out. I dont really have a ride to the school. Sure..."walk". Its a bit far and a bit boring to do by myself. So i might not be able to get the actual permit for awhile now. And i'm not THAT sad i suppose. I'd like to finish my sophmore year summer off without work, then start up when i'm a junior. This IS my last summer of freedom for the rest of my life. I wish to spend it the way i want to. Lets face it, my other dreams arent going to come true. I'm not gonna win the lottery and hillary duff probably wont knock on my front door begging for sex. Its a rough life i lead. From now on i'll have a job during summer break or i wont have a summer break at all. Kinda ghey, but hey, thats life. I'm going to be working down at villiage lanes...right next to princess if anyone wants to come by and drop a hello, maybe bowl a few. I'll let u know when i start. O just yesterday i purchased a new cell fone. *pwnt*. Its the newest sony ericsson. Quite nice if i do say so myself. I guess thats it for now. As always thanks for reading. -Me
