      another quick post. i'm tired. but i'm almost done organizing my new computer. i never realized how much work would be involved to get it the way i want it. i really don't have anything else to say. no one reads this page so what difference does it make?  warsawpack is coming up soon, so that's something to look forward to. i might get to interview them because i have a friend who has his own campus radio show. he thought that i might be helpful, so i just might do that. so that's kind of interesting.

      you know what i hate? people who talk to much. i never say anything. you know why? because i know that no one gives a shit about what i have to say. i know enough to keep my fucking mouth shut. i hate it when people subject the world to their views constantly. obviously, you need to speak out when the situation calls for it. but don't fucking waste your breath crying wolf. no one cares about your inconsequential ramblings. why not get a blog of your own and type your thoughts out for the one or two people who care enough to read about what you think. seriously, you are not as important as you think you are. you are the same infectious human waste as everyone else. recognize this and mitigate my aggravation. you pretentious piece of shit.

      i don't know how much time i have so i guess i have to keep this short. my computer is fucked. so i bought a new one. i should be getting it in a week or so.   nothing much else has happened to me, so i'm sorry for the lame entry. i have been continuing work on my music, and i'm working on what sounds like the ultimate tool song. yes, i write for tool now. no seriously, it seems like everything i do with my guitar busts out a riff that sounds like adam jones... as if that was a bad thing...i want to learn how to play the sitar eventually so i can add that to my progressive metal sound.

      you know what irritates me... people who use alternating CAPS with lowercase to get my attention. fuck you, aSsHoLe! you're not fooling anyone with your UPPERCASE-lowercase antics. some might say the same about me typing in all lowercase letters... but they'd be fucking stupid. i use lower caps because it requires less effort. whereas these UPPERCASE-lowercase mother fuckers have nothing better to do then hit the shift key every other letter. you really fucking suck and i hope someone learn's your ass some responsibility some day. do you realize how stupid you make yourself look? i also hate people who use cutesy short forms to save a fucking letter or two (for example, they type "2" instead of "to"). you, i'm afraid, are the fucking downfall of civilization... so please stop it, you stupid idiot fuck.  on a lighter note, i learned today that pictionary is the greatest game of all time. it's so simple, but we all seemed to have a great time. it got really intense, and by the end of it i was screaming like a mother fucker. i was so drained. but good prevailed over the forces of evil... translation... we came back from behind (really behind) to kick ass.  i thought it was really interesting to learn about how people approached their drawings. you really got to see how people can interpret things from different perspectives. i also like how you could draw a penis or a phallic object, and it would somehow relate... but that's just me.  my family came to visit me, and it really seemed to make the day. my mommy made me lunch and we sat and watched tv while i ate. it was really like being at home. i bitch about my family a lot, but times like that really make you feel like you're a kid again. i miss those days, but it's nice to re-live them every once in a while.  yes, today was a good day.

      my eye's are bleeding. no... really... they are... okay maybe not. but it felt like it when i washed my face just now. i saw the pocket dwellers last night. they were pretty bitchin'. unfortunately, i was the only one who thought that. everyone else who went with me thought that they were boring. well... open your ears people... cos that shit was funked up.   anyway. it occured to me that i'm a grad student now and i still own frosh shirts. god damn. what am i doing with myself? 23 years and counting, and i've yet to accomplish anything of any consequence. time for bed. i promise i'll think of more interesting things to write about when i get more time.

      i feel like i'm going to throw-up soon. argh. i've spent the last days in essentially the same room, without any contact with real human beings... i ate fries for dinner last night, and i have to say that it got pretty gross... i should probably shave soon; i look like i've been trapped for months. some might say that that's not too far from the truth. the sink is full of fishes, and she's got dirty dishes on the brain.

      another day wasted without accomplishing anything of any consequence. all i do is work towards no goal. i fucking waste time a lot too... whatever... i wish had something newsworthy to talk about right now... dammit... why does time fly when you have fun, but drag like hell when you want time to fly?... i really want to drop out of school right now, but unfortunately i don't have the sense to do that. i'm an idiot and i don't think i will ever change... but hey, at least i'm going to see the pocket dwellers tomorrow night. live music is my reason to live.

      you know what's great... the feeling you get after you take a shower or just wash your face... for a brief part of the day, nothing else in the world matters... all you care about for the one moment is being as clean and pure as possible... it's too bad that that feeling doesn't last for very long. it's like a force-field that protects you from the the rest of the world... but it's only temporary. i wish that peaceful, relaxed, relieved feeling could last forever, but it can't... serenity now, insanity later.

      so it's fucking valentine's day. la-di-fucking-da. why don't you fucking use your fucking mind and think of something original to do other then consume. oh, but it's nice to have a day to show you care. well fuck you if you need a reminder to care and fuck you if you need a reminder that i do. birthdays, weddings, holidays, whatever... it's all the same old crap fueled by societal norms. why not break the cycle and try to be different. is there anything about you that hasn't been done before? i honestly doubt it. so why don't you do your sorry ass a favour and kill yourself now. is there really any benefit to perpetuating your affliction?... i don't think so... but then, most people think i'm too extreme and that i need to loosen up. well fuck them too.

      you look so pale and weak; a caricature for the new age. hidden behind your coveted war paint, are the tattered remains of your ugly face.  am i the only one who craves something real? something i can touch and feel? marvel in the authentic and genuine. when did we lapse into visual heroine?  counterfeit impressions being made on my mind; i cannot stomach an artificial paradigm. clowns and skeletons are chasing after me. i can only pray that they'll never catch up.

      "we're a generation raised by women... so i'm wondering if another woman is really the answer"... wise words from an imaginary wise man... today i've decided that the perfect girl doesn't exist... at least my perfect girl... i have stringent demands... and i'd love to think that they could be met... but i'm asking for too much... that's been my problem with everything... i want it all.. i met an interesting and decent girl recently, but because she wasn't perfect (by my definition), i decided i didn't want to pursue anything with her... what's wrong with me?... some people say i should stick to my guns, but i think i'm an idiot and the cause of all my problems... yes... somehow i'm involved in a conspiracy against myself... an unconscious suicide...  other news... exams are coming... and i want to sleep... exams are pointless and stupid and prove nothing... i've been passing exams since 1994... and they've never proved anything... i'm still a moron  i went to my favourite chinese restaurant to pick up some more chow mein (a week's supply). i just don't like how i had to spend forever trying to explain what i wanted when i ordered over the phone... but their chow mein is to die for...  finally, have you ever had a falling out that just sort of caught you by surprise... you didn't see the progression, but looking back, it was always there?... life's funny that way, you can feel so intensely about a friendship/relationship at one point in your life, and then later that person can just set you off... time changes everything...  this weekend was kind of boring, but we played some pictionary, which is always great... but it made me kind of sad... pretty soon, i'll lose touch with all my friends here like i did after high school... and then i'll be a sad lonely prick who won't have anyone to complain to...  rollins in two days motherfucker...

      argh... i don't think i ever want to drink again... tequila is my new enemy... is it just me or is it that alcohol not only makes you do things that you normally wouldn't do, but it also makes you do things you had no intention of doing... allegedly i had someone pinned to the ground at some point, but i honestly don't recall that at all (and that would definitely never be my intention)... i remember drinking a lot... being stupid and silly... and then feeling ill, so i was lying down on my friend's bed... i remember falling down on the ground at some point... then smacking my friends' asses (that i meant to do)... and then i was lying on the ground by the door... and then eventually i had to puke... and now i feel like crap... i probably gave someone an impression that i was interested in them, and it wouldn't be unreasonable for them to make that assumption based on my actions, except for the fact that i'm not interested in them (that's not to suggest that anything is wrong with them, but i just don't have an interest). it makes no sense. in a sober state, i've been asking myself all day, what the hell that was all about?... why was i acting that way when i have no interest?... i do know that i become more friendly with everybody... so i'm sorry if anyone gets the wrong idea or is upset with my antics... anyway... that's the last i want to hear of that... i think i might give up drinking altogether... people laugh when i suggest i might have a drinking problem, but i don't think it's an insane notion. i have a tendency to enjoy things to excess.   other news... i am working on the greatest song of all time... seriously... i just hope i didn't steal the riff from factory 81... eventually i'll listen to the CD, and hopefully, i will be wrong in thinking i stole a riff from them... i'm never going to finish anything for the next six months... but eventually it will happen...  edgefest was announced this morning... and it reminded me of my time puking in the toilet... edgefest is happening july 2nd at molson amphitheatre featuring good charlotte, finger eleven, jet, billy talent, something corporate, alexisonfire, jersey and the salads... all i can say is that edge isn't even trying anymore... good charlotte is not a headlining band, finger eleven is decent but they're on edgefest every year, jet is a white stripes wannabe band, billy talent is decent but they're not a festival band (i'd much rather see them in a small venue), something corporate is just plain stupid (i don't mean that they suck, but edge has never played them before, so why the hell are they using them for their lame show), alexisonfire rules and is too good for edgefest (and most people that go will think they suck because they're stupid motherfuckers), jersey is just pure shite, and the salads are nothing special... so basically this has got to be the worst edgefest line-up i can think of... possibly the years headlined by creed or hole could be worst... nothing will ever top toolfest in 2001... god damn... at least try to put a good line-up together... and please get a better venue then the amp.  henry rollins is coming up... i can't wait to see him... he's a really smart and interesting guy...

      i want to start off by saying we kicked ass in tonight's hockey game. nothing (in terms of hockey) beat's a playoff win. i was great, the defense was great, and the offense was great. the other team was composed of whiney bitches that wouldn't shut the fuck up... and they got theirs... so fuck 'em.  i've been thinking about how when you ask people what kind of music they listen to...  a lot of people will say "everything"... this is because they are composed entirely of bull shit... next time some one says that to you... ask them if they like hardcore... or death metal... or emo... more often than not it'll be chicks who think it's trendy to say they like everything. fuck you bitch, you don't like shit...  finally... without a trace is the greatest show ever... the acting and suspense is unsurpassed... watch it or die...

      i'm convinced that one day i will buy a gun and blow my brains out. not today, not tomorrow, not in the next 15 years... but eventually... i will declare that i have had enough of this seemingly constant barrage of insignificant bull shit...  for instance... motherfuckers that walk the sidewalk thinking that they and their close associates and friends can take up the whole sidewalk. they think that i should be forced to get off the sidewalk to make room for their sorry asses.   or other motherfuckers who call me (and i've written about this already) and try to speak in a language other than english. and instead of trying to cope, when they realize that i am a lost cause, they fucking hang up on me... you fucking dicks... if i find you, i recommend you brace yourself for my wrath...   god damn it bitches. get your sorry asses in gear before i feed you your own dick. that's right... self-sodomy is your punishment for disrespecting me. ideally i'd like to rip off your midget penis and cram it down your throat until you choke and die...  on a positive note, the next LP is coming up. get it, LP? i thought i wasn't going to be pumped for it since we just had the first one a couple weeks ago, but i am pumped. i hope people appreciate the care with which i've selected tracks. damn, if i could only come close to writing full songs... maybe one day someone could tell their friends about the greatness of my tracks...

      if i gave you a $1,000, would you solve all my problems?... no?... you fucking dumbass... a thousand clams can get me a shit load of cds... and cds are audio crack... my how i love cds... i can't wait to get a whole bunch after i graduate and need to sedate myself after enduring bull shit...  i wish something interesting was happening to me, but it isn't. i interviewed the singer for warsawpack last week, but i forgot to write about that... he was awesome... i don't think i've met a nicer musician. he was more than helpful and he was just cool to hang with. i really hope the band is successful. they really deserve it.  the next LP is coming up soon... see the link for details of the last one... i have some choice cuts in store for the audioslaves out there... you'll just have to wait and see... i'm too good to you people. i should be hoarding this goodness... but i can't help myself... i have to jizz all over you with this aural sperm...

      i feel like i'm erased, so kill me just in case. dammit. i feel so dumb right now. i don't know anything, or at least not very much, and i'm going to fail, so why am i wasting my time? i should just get a nice cushy job and make some spending money and just fucking enjoy the summer. instead i will spend the majority of the summer locked away trying to learn complete bull shit. how can you learn something when you don't believe in it? when the very thought of it makes you want to buy a gun, point to your head, and pull the trigger... i feel like my mind has been soiled by all the crap i'm forced to learn. i need to cleanse my self of all this useless shit.

      i am annoyed by poorly founded attacks on same-sex marriage. anyone that supports views against gay marriage on the basis of religion, is irrational. by definition, rational thought embodies "a belief in reason rather than religion as a guiding principle". rational thinking is imperative to the resolution of any societal dilemma. the second you introduce a religious source to support your argument, you taint it with something less than objective truth. religious scriptures are allegedly the word of god or other higher powers, and are inherently incapable of being assessed in a rational manner. the word of god is not to be questioned, because it is the word of god. this doesn't sound like a rational debate to me, but rather, a one-way flow of information.  christians claim that they do not condemn homosexuals because they adhere to the principle of "hate the sin, but love the sinner." to label an act as a sin, or to label a person as a sinner, is to deem it/them to be morally reprehensible. to suggest that someone lacks morals is to condemn them. please don't try to sugar coat your intolerance and inability to accept people that are different. i would be much happier if bush and all of his cronies were more blatant with their hatred, and labelled this latest crusade, what it really is: the war on faggots. don't get me wrong. i empathize with homosexuals completely; it's just that nothing irks me more than someone trying to mask intolerance. if dubya is not going to come out and stand behind his hatred, than he should keep it to himself.  religion is a funny thing. it convinces people to believe in a mystical man (yes, man and not woman) who lives in the sky (and I'm not talking about santa claus). this is accomplished with little objective evidence. surely, if you can make the leap of faith to believe in such a diety, you can find a place in your heart and mind to afford homosexuals the same rights you take for granted.  i'm a vegetarian. i believe that it is wrong to consume other animals for my survival when i can live without doing so. however, i cannot fairly expect my fellow human beings to live by the standards i set for myself. that principle works for me in my life, and that should be good enough for me. in the same way, religion should be enough to satiate you and your quest to live what you perceive to be a good life. however, in my opinion, it is oppressive for you to expect others to live by your personal code of conduct.  god may or may not exist. if you cannot accept this fundamental human dilemma as being unsolved and unsolvable, then you are irrational and quite frankly delusional. for anyone to attempt to justify their argument in a rational debate by appealing to higher powers is nothing short of pretentious. stop it. live your life the way you see fit, but keep your religious propaganda to yourself. you do not and cannot know more than that which you experience in your short lifetime. everything else is suspect.

      i think i fucked up because i didn't do anything when she was giving me the chance... deep down I know that she isn't "the one" or exactly what i'm looking for, so it's easier to take but it would still have been nice for me to not fuck up the few chances i do get... why must all my dealings be doomed for disaster?... rightly or wrongly i think most people that i meet are complete idiots. i rarely ever meet people that i can relate to. i do know that she's gotta be into music as intensely as i am, or there's just no point...  the other day i was walking when i saw this girl... and she had this really pissed off look on her face... and she had this weird pinkish red hair... and she just looked really interesting... i dunno, what my point is other than, you can't just walk up to strangers and get to know them... it was like in american beauty and the guy with the camera (without the camera or creepy stalker issue)... but she was just intensely interesting... she wasn't "drop-dead gorgeous"... but she was just interesting...

      today was an interesting day. well not really, but i went out for a walk and saw a lot of funky houses on columbia street near king street. it was pretty cool to see how different each house was as opposed to the homogenized crap of my neighbourhood. i went to my favourite chinese restaurant (okay, the only chinese restaurant i've eaten at), and picked up some chow mein. i can't get enough of that stuff. and it totally beats eating the crap i normally eat. and i have enough for the week. woo hoo! i wish i had more time to go to the indie record store on king street. maybe next time.  today's rant is about people who call me and decide that they are going to speak in a language other than english just because of my name. and people who run businesses and answer the phone in a language other than english when i call them. god damn it. has the whole world gone crazy?... this is canada and we speak english here. i'm not saying you're not allowed to speak another language. of course you are. but, i think it would just be courteous to rest of the country if you made an effort to speak english and not assume that i speak your language. i have so many relatives that have immigrated to canada, have jobs, and have lived here for more than 10 years with out being able to carry on a basic english conversation. what the hell do you do with all your time?... you watch tv... and what kind of tv?... tv in the language of your homeland. why did you even bother coming here if you're not going to make an attempt to incorporate our societal norms? i know that sounds mean... but it's not. i'm the child of immigrants. and they speak english coherently. they're not perfect, but neither are you. they can at least function. if you don't function, all you are is labour for our economy. you're useless in every other way, and you should just go back to where you came from since you obviously don't want to be here. be proud of where you came from, but also be proud of where you are. make an effort to be part of your new community. if not, get out.

      4 years ago today i saw oasis for the first time at maple leaf gardens. the first song to roar through the amp was "fuckin' in the bushes". it was easily the greatest night of my life. my first moshpit with my favourite band of all time. it was electric. i never felt so alive. the rest is history... here's what i wrote the next day (i'm warning you, it's long and there are references to pictures and i'm too lazy to learn how to put pictures into my blog):  I always knew that it would be the greatest night of my life, but I never knew how I right I was going to be. April 29, 2000, will go down in history, as the first time I witnessed the genius of the Gallagher brothers. It was a magical day, filled with fun and excitement. This is how it went:  I spent the night before tossing and turning in bed in anticipation of the concert. I woke up every hour starting at 2:00 am, until I finally put an end to it and getting up at 7:00. I went into the bathroom and prepared myself for Oasis, coming out an hour later. I donned my favourite shirt, the one with the traditional rectangular Oasis logo. So I was good to go. After breakfast, I filled my pockets with the essentials. The tickets, money, my puffer, kleenex, tylenol, and some gum. So by like 9:30 I was ready with 10 hours to go. I spent the next two hours checking my pockets to make sure I had everything. I must have checked for the tickets around forty times.  So now it's 11:30 and Brian should be arriving soon. I must have looked out the window maybe 20 times in search of his car. I would have waited outside, but there were those weirdo church people who try to convert you to Christianity, so I kept away from them. They really piss me off because they think it's okay to ring doorbells at 10 in the morning. Sure, I wake up early, but what about the people who are asleep. I swear, it takes a lot of self control to not yell at them.   Anyway, Brian arrives, and we head for the City Centre, where we get on the Go bus. We spent most of the time talking about music, other bands we were getting into, the practicality of mp3s, other concerts we might fancy going to over the course of the summer. On the bus there were these kids, who looked around 10-11, who were playing "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" with wrestling trivia questions, it was hilarious. They even said "Is that your final answer?"   So we get to York Mills where we need to take a subway to get to College. Having been quite a while since I last took a subway, I had some trouble grasping the concept. So I put my money in this box, and I don't even get a ticket, what? So once we get on the subway, I'm thinking that I don't wanna sit near any weirdos so I sit between Brian and this lady, who thought I was a hooligan or something 'cos it pissed her off having to sit next to someone.  Once we got off at College, we made our way towards the Gardens where we were going to meet Jos and Nathan. So when I first see them, it's really weird because I'm seeing them out of context. We're not in Waterloo!!! Anyway, it was cool to see some signs for some cover band who pays tribute to, and I quote, "Oasis, the greatest rock 'n' roll band of all time." Needless to say, I was quite impressed.   This is a picture of the Gardens early that afternoon, way before the show gets underway. We were there around 1:30, and I was really surprised to see that people were actually in line already. This naturally pissed me off because I hate all diehard Oasis fans who have the potential to stand in my way. I love them when they can hook me up with bootlegs and mp3s, but I don't want them there at the concert.  Oh well, I let it slide and we were off to grab a bite to eat. We hit the big HMV before we went to the food court in the Eaton Centre. I was kind of pissed off that Quizno's was no longer there because I ate there before the Our Lady Peace concert and they made some good subs. Oh well, I tried a baked potato with mushrooms and cheese, and Nathan, you were right, it was really good. I want one now actually.  So after we ate, we headed down to the Muchmusic environment in order to check out Travis, but when we got there we could hardly see anything, we decided to leave. On the way back towards the Gardens, we hit the bathrooms in the Eaton Centre, where I encountered an automatic toilet, which I have never seen before. Imagine my fear of leaving the stall when I couldn't find the flush thingy. Luckily the toilet flushed itself before I could really panic. So just before we got in line at the Gardens, we went to a convenience store to buy some water bottles in case we got thirsty while in the pit.   Here's a picture of people in line, waiting to get their wristbands. I'm pretty sure that we're in this picture, but I'm not totally sure. I mean I think I see Nathan at one point, and then I think I see Brian, but it's too hard to tell. Anyway, we spent about two and a half hours waiting in this line, and to my surprise, we never reached a point where we were all really bored. We just kept talking about so much stuff, that the time went by really quickly, at least that's my opinion. A lot of the time we talked about Nick and all the crazy stuff he did over the past eight months.  The whole time that we were in line, I thought that there was a huge line in front of us, but I couldn't really tell where the entrance was. Nathan and Jos determined that it was really close, so things were looking up.   The only reason this dude is on my page is because he is displaying one of the cool Oasis shirts that were on sale. I was lucky enough to get two. The orange one, which has North American tour dates on the back, and a navy one with the Oasis logo and some confusing circles on the front.  They had lots of cool Oasis merchandise for sale, but I had my heart set on getting Oasis shirts so I was happy. It pissed me off how they had this really neat shirt, but it was one of those girlie baby tees that are so small they have to be painted on.  The doors were supposed to open at around 7:00, but they decided to let us in at around 6:00. I appreciated this because it meant we would have the chance to sit down before we were going to stand up again.  So when they let us in they told us we couldn't take in our water bottles, so there went the anti-dehydration project. Oh well, we got in and ran to a spot that was like 10-20 feet away from the microphone.    We sat down, and then I decided that I was too excited to not go get my shirts, so I ran off and bought them. When I ran back the security guard yelled at me, and I basically gave him "the Liam look", and I ran onto the floor to find everyone, and it was like the caf scenario all over again. Nathan, Jos, and, Brian had a good time laughing at my bewilderment. I sat down and showed off my new shirts before I put them both over my old Oasis shirt. So, I was totally ready for Oasis now. We sat down for quite awhile before Nathan and I realized that our asses hurt so we decided to stand up.   Before you know it, everyone wants to stand up. We all got up around 7:00, so we had a half hour to go before Travis got on stage. With like 2 minutes to go, and Jos still sitting, a stampede of people come running by and I think we've lost Jos for good. She eventually comes back to us, after scaring the shit out of me. I was like, Jos? Jos? Where did Jos go? While were standing, I met this really cool British guy, I never got his name, but we started talking about Travis and Oasis.   So Travis finally took stage and we were really impressed when they came on stage, all wearing Leaf jerseys! Fran took the mic, and he said "This one's for the Leafs," as they belted out all i want to do is rock. They went on to play hits such as, good feeling, as you are, driftwood, turn, and slide show.   They drove the crowd wild when they dedicated writing to reach you to Noel because of his inspiration and support.   Here's a shot of Fran as he belts out why does it always rain on me?, which was by far the best song they played. They sounded really good and got the crowd into the mood for a rocking Oasis show.  It was kind of neat to see that Travis's drummer looks like Felix Potvin, seeing as he was wearing a Leaf jersey  I decided to listen to some Travis prior to the concert when I found out they were the opening act and I now like them very much. I like both of their albums Good Feeling and The Man Who. You should check them out.  So Travis were done their set and the crew started to prepare the stage for Oasis.  I kept looking back at the clock every minute, counting down the time until Oasis were going to come on. We were just kind of standing there when the arena gets dark and all you hear is the wicked instrumental, Fuckin' In The Bushes. I don't think that Oasis were actually playing it 'cos I couldn't see anybody on stage. Anyway, the screen behind the stage started to display a visual interpretation of the song, don't worry, it's not what you might think, or in Nick's case, sorry, no one was fuckin' in the bushes.   Oasis takes the stage and the crowd goes absolutely apeshit. People start pushing us, trying to get closer to the band.  The band starts to play the intro to Go Let It Out, and this is a shot of a mean and moody Liam as he stares at the crowd. He had some cool antics while he was on stage. He had a strong voice and he was pulling his usual stunts. He was having staring contests with the crowd, he'd just look at you and stand there for half a minute while someone did a guitar solo. He'd rest his tambourine on the microphone or walk around with it clenched in his teeth. What was really cool was when he had a flashlight and he would pick out a fan and point it at them. I am proud to say that the wanker got me right in the eye, and it was fuckin' worth it. Near the end of the show he through out his water bottle and I was pissed that I didn't get it, although we all know it was meant for me. At one point he was looking right at me and he was just staring me down as I sang his praises. That was totally tops.  Liam really put his heart into the singing. He was wearing a really cool shirt and he was sweating like mad. His shirt was so freakin' wet.  You should have seen him on the Letterman show without his sunglasses, he looks so young. And I don't care what other people think, I thought his shirt was really cool. Here are some more pictures from the night:   Here we have the lovely Gem and Andy playing the guitar oh so well.  A lot of people thought that the two additions didn't really play a big role in terms of getting the crowd psyched, but I think they acted sort of like Alan, in a calm, cool, collective type manner.  And besides, they sounded totally awesome so who cares? Gem is a wicked guitarist, and Andy was doing great as well.  It should be interesting to see what the new lads can add to Oasis. Definitely an improved sound from the live gigs I've seen with Guigsy and Bonehead.   "Do you keep the receipt, for the friends that you buy?"   I'm almost certain that this is a shot of Noel during Where Did It All Go Wrong? As always, Noel had a beautiful voice and it was great to hear him for about a fourth of the night.  He spent most of the night quietly playing the songs, but when they did the encore, Noel was totally on fire. Noel seems to be thinner than usual, which may or may not be a good thing. I dunno, all I know is that he was totally on the mark, he played really well and he made the songs come alive for me.  Anybody who knows me well enough knows that I'm obsessed with Oasis, but the way they played made become a brand new fan. I had to pull out the albums and listen to all the songs again as they just totally blew me away when I heard them live.  You can get all the bootlegs you like, but nothing beats being there and feeling it in your bones.   Okay, I know you can barely see him, but it's Alan on drums with his funky long hair. I dunno, Alan is just so quiet, and conservative so it was weird to see him with something other than the usually short haircut.  He was buzzin' all night long, having loads of fun on the drums.  The part I really wanted to see out of Alan was when he had the drum solo during Don't Look Back In Anger. I've heard that song maybe a million times and I always wanted to see him during the solo, and I did it! He's just too cool.  Here's a look at what they played:  Set list:   Fuckin' In The Bushes  I don't think it's possible to get sick of this instrumental despite the constant repetition. As soon as this song started playing, the crowd went wild! We were jumping like mad savages, ready to get a glimpse of Oasis as soon as they got on stage. Like I said before, I think they just played a tape of this because no one was on stage when the played it. It doesn't matter, the band made their way on to the stage, welcomed with a huge ovation from the crowd.   Go Let It Out  The big single! We all had our voices at this point so as soon as Liam hits the part where he says "Life is precocious…" We were all yelling it. And then it was "go let it out, go let it in, go let it out." Awesome track, and the crowd was buzzing    Who Feels Love?  "Found what I lost insiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide…" The hippy-psychedelic number. Awesome. Liam did a good job with his voice when he had to sing the longer words. I liked it because it was a cross between the album version and the acoustic one.   Supersonic    "I need to be myself, I can't be no one else…" This was the first one where we were really jumping like mad savages. You can never go wrong with this track, the first Oasis single ever. By now we had definitely lost Jos and Nathan, and if I didn't grab Brian, I would have lost him as well.   Shakermaker  "I'd like to be somebody else, and not know where I've been…" For a second I was confused why they played this song because Liam tends to mess it up and say "I'd like to teach the world to sing," from the Coke commercial. Top gibberish.    Acquiesce  "I don't know what it is that makes me feel alive…" You cannot have an Oasis concert without this track, a b-side to Some Might Say, which should have been an a-side. I always love the bit when Noel takes it higher with his "because we need!" Always a crowd pleaser, and a wicked sing-along.    Where Did It All Go Wrong?   Noels first song of the night was introduced like this: "Umm… here's something from our new album." Gem was really wicked on the guitar solo.   Gas Panic!   "This one's for all the people who smoke pot," says Liam has pretends to light up. It's a song about the sense of "panic" you get after taking drugs. Again another amazing performance.    Roll With It   "You've gotta roll with it, you've gotta take you're time, you've gotta say what you say, don't let any fucker get in your way…" Liam belts out the classic line change that has always pissed Noel off. But hey, I think they should have recorded it with Liam's addition as it truly captures the essence of the song.    Stand By Me   "This one's for all the girlie's," says Liam as he begins the only track off of Be Here Now, which is a crying shame because they should have played Don't Go Away and D'You Know What I Mean?    Wonderwall   "There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how, yeah I don't know how." An electric version of the classic groundbreaker which just provides more evidence that it's the same song as D'You Know What I Mean?, at least that's what I think.    Cigarettes & Alcohol   "This one's for all the people back in England," says Liam as we get back into the wild and crazy jumping. I think this song says all I ever wanted to say about life. "Is it worth the aggravation, to find yourself a job, when there's nothing worth working for?" Tack on a bit of Led Zepplin's whole lotta love at the end, and you've got a classic.    Don't Look Back In Anger  "And so Sally can wait, she knows it's too late, as we're walking on by…" Another stellar performance by Noel which featured the wicked drum solo by Alan.    Live Forever  One of the greatest moments of the night. "This is the last one, and then we're all going home," says Liam, not expecting to be welcomed with a huge chorus of boos. He responds to the booing by jokingly saying, "fuck you lot!" And then, as if we all knew what we were supposed to do next, we all gave him the finger, and he smile as if he was saying, "yeah, damn right, you better give me the finger." It was so cool, he wanted us to give him the finger, it was as if he planned it. After the song was done, Oasis left the stage, and we just kept on chanting "Oasis…Oasis…Oasis…" until… they came back.    Encore:   Hey Hey, My My (Into The Black)  "This one's by Neil Young," says Noel as he tears into the wicked cover. Oasis have been playing this song as a tribute to the late Kurt Cobain. It is a reference to a line in his suicide note. "It's better to burnout, then to fade away, my my, hey hey…"    Helter Skelter  Just before Noel started the Beatles's classic, I yelled it out. I have Brian as a witness. I fuckin' screamed it out, "helter skelter" and behold, The Chief came through for me. I don't think I'll ever forget that.    Rock 'N' Roll Star  I knew that this was the last one so, I was prepared for a wicked finale, but I would never have expected this. Part of the chorus is, "tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star…" but Liam did another addition and near the end of the song he said, " tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star in Toronto…" That just blew the crowd away to see Liam acknowledge us like that. The end coincided with a series of "It's just rock 'n' roll, it's just rock 'n' roll."  When the band were done, they waved goodbye and left the stage. Alan threw out his drumsticks, and Brian and I could have got them if we weren't pushed out of the way.  Oh well, as Noel waved goodbye, and he smiled at me!!! Blew me away, like you'll never imagine.   That was my night, and no one can take it away from me. After the concert I went into a bit of shock because I couldn't believe that I had just seen my idols. I became a bit sad because it was over and I was afraid I may never get to see them again. Let the memory live on forever and hopefully they've got a tour or twelve left in them. Cheers.

      so i know it's been a while... i've had things to do okay... i recently saw a documentary segment on the news about breast implants. they showed this 40 year old woman who thought her tits were too tiny, and so she got a boob job. what a fucking tool. i'll admit that i like tits as much as the next guy. for whatever reason, as men, there's something about breasts that makes us stupid... who knows what it is... (although my theory is that no one let's us see them for most of our lives, so ir's like an inflated myth. if there was no censorship of breasts and nipples, maybe we wouldn't care so much about them)... anyway, like i was saying, as much as i like breasts, there size really doesn't matter. i don't think most men really care... honestly... i couldn't care less if a girl was flatter than me if she was the coolest girl in the world... we live in a such a fucked up time where everyone is so self-conscious about the way they look and about their bodies. wake up  people. your body is not a fucking car. don't fucking add and remove parts like a new set of rims or a bitchin' sound system. this is your body. you've got what you've fucking got, and just be happy with it. the only situation i could possibly forsee that i would accept a body mod is if you have some kind of medical condition or accident that fucks you up... even then i'm not sure...

      you know what's gross... when you just step out the shower... and then you have to take a shit... that feeling is so disgusting... you just cleansed your self... and now you have to take a dump... what a waste of a perfectly good shower... obviously you try to avoid this problem by taking a dump before you shower, but sometimes it's out of your control... your body just decides when it has to shit  speaking of shit... a good shitting is an orgasmic release... i love the feeling of relief after your ass is ready to explode because you have to wait to use the bathroom... the same applies to pissing...   bodies can be so much fun... more about bodies later...

      i wish i could change places with whoever it is that i see on the otherside of a mirror. they must be the bizarro-me, existing without any of my flaws. maybe i just like the way i look in the mirror after i wash my face every night. is that a crime?  and for the motherfuckers that care, yes, i did have milk and cookies tonight. just like every night. it's a ritual for me. i don't even think about it. i have dinner, and a couple hours later i have milk and cookies. i get made of fun of as if this is a childish thing to do. eat me, asshole.  i got a compliment on my writing skills, which is always something to be happy about. now, if i could just harness this alleged skill. that would kick a huge portion of ass. perhaps even a whole ass. here's a question: do people ever actually kick people in the ass? it rarely ever happens. i've never actually seen it being done. so i propose that the term kick-ass and the associated expressions "kicks ass" and "ass-kicking" and "kick some ass" are all meaningless fucking expressions, based on an intricate web of lies. when all else fails, blame it on terrorism. you motherfuckers. always making shit up.   say hello to the summer of your discontent, you self-indulgent pig dog. you fucked up the hand-off and now the nihilists have come to give you your come-uppance. maybe it's me, but i told you this would happen, at least implied that their would be hell to pay for your ill-advised ways. there are repercussions for every decision you make. some small, some large, and others are priceless. the rabbit is out of the hat now. i reckon he gets fucked. proper fucked. hehe.  silly rabbit, trix are for kids.

      i am jack's inflammed sense of rejection. i cannot describe the feelings of resentment and anger in me right now. i just interpret things differently than others, and that is my problem and not theirs, but i can still feel bitter about it. it's the beginning of the end, as i know it anyway. say what you will, we have reached the point of no return.  doesn't anyone care about "not economically viable man?" that guy totally rocks. he's my new hero. but does anyone give a shit about him? no. well i do, but i obviously don't count. what sucks is that this is what they always told me about. and i refused to believe them. but they were right and i am wrong once again. dammit. you can only ever count on yourself. never forget that. ever. it's the fucking truth. in the end, that's all you've got. this cryptic entry is a poem to myself. in case of fire, break the glass. does any of this ring a bell? i'm not playing around anymore, this is serious fucking business, so you had better get your shit together before you get your shit kicked in. not by me of course, but by some random assailant in a ski mask. i don't make the rules, i just break them, and blame your sorry ass. figure it out man. it's all right here in the brochure. club med. $50 dollars a day. all expenses paid. limited time offer. all sales are final. call now. thank you come again. batteries not included. some objects are larger than they appear in the mirror. do not enter. for employees only. taxes not included. while quantities last. participating retailers only. fuck you, fuck you very much.  eat my ass motherfucker (an open invitation to toss my salad!). i am now photographically enabled as you can tell with my bitchin' picture of buddy christ almighty. "hail satan!" also, you can notice my blog has undergone a major schematic change. all part of the quality service here at oasisteria, inc.  here's some, ahem, food for thought: if you were to take part in an act of feltching... is it better to be the feltchor or the feltchee?... you thought about it didn't you?... is there really a better answer? isn't the better question, how do you go about proposing a feltch-fest? this is what keeps me up at night.  so that's all for now. over and out... bitches.

      i'm falling down. i feel like i stand alone in this chaotic journey. i've tried to make the best of things, and i just don't see that ever happening. i wish i could be content with just having a job, making money, and buying shit. that seems to be the way it works for most people. but i question the point of that type of existence. life is a meaningless journey that we all have to endure. the only thing that fuels my fire is my intense personal connection to music. when i hear certain songs, it's like the soundwaves flow through my veins and are part of my bloodstream. if the song were to stop playing before it ended, i'd just fuckin' die because the blood wouldn't get to my brain. the music is part of me, and it makes me whole. without music i would fucking die in this shit hole of a world. music is my blood.

      chore... r.i.p.  last night i saw chore's last show ever. chore is no more. it was an intense and emotional performance from four extremely talented individuals. i might go as far as saying it was one of the best shows i've ever seen. it was fuckin' hot and i felt like i was going to die of heat exhaustion. the guys in chore took it all in stride and poured their souls into every note. it saddens me that someone can be so good at what they do, and never get the recognition and attention they so badly deserve.  what can i say? support indie music you selfish motherfucker. stop listening to corporate rock. at least, exclusively. go to local shows and support local bands. it's cheaper than going to see the radio flavour of the month and you'll eventually find a band that will actually give you the time of day. it'll be your little secret from the rest of the world. but try to spread the word when you find something you like. yes not all indie music is great, in fact, a lot of it is shit, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't give it a chance. believe me. you'll eventually find bands that kick the ass of anything you hear on the radio. bands like chore, warsawpack, tallman, godspeed you black emperor!... this is what music should sound like.  i've been to enough arena rock gigs and poser festivals to know what it means to be a real musician. shit, i'm a real musician. music isn't about selling records, it's about making tunes. for yourself. if other people like it, that's a bonus.

"f. you pal..." that's right... i said the letter f.... who the fuck started that shit... jesus people are dumb...   anyway... ufe = efu... as in write the ufe and get fucked. hard. with a dick. in your ass. for a couple days. and it's not about love. it's about pain. intense, dick-inflicted, ass-penetrating, primal scream inducing, continuous, long-term, rewardless, thankless, lifeless, soul-killing, joy-murdering, time-raping, repressed memory creating, life-altering pain.  "i... have... found... some kind of temporary sanity... in this... shit, blood, and cum on my hands."

      sometimes i wonder what the fuck is wrong with me. why do i get bored of everything so easily. i've lost my zest for everything that interested me long ago. i just need to get through the next 4 or so months and then i can have time to re-energize myself.  i just don't get people sometimes. little things will set me off and i pretentiously look down on people. i'm no saint, but i can just hate everyone and everything so much sometimes. it's not fair, but that's how i feel sometimes.  i just feel so let down by people sometimes... especially now... i feel that it's just a matter of time before a repeat of high school. we're all going to go our separate ways and my attempts to maintain friendships will be futile. what am i going to do. befriend the proles of lice slaughterhouse poopers? something tells me that that's not likely. i've made so many great friends over the years. and in some way shape or form them they all have let me down or they will eventually.  i also find that i have trouble relating to the people around me. no one i know can identify with what i go through and vice versa. i'm a one man army and i'm losing the war. i'm a whinny little prick. and that's probably never going to change.  on the bright side (if there is one), dropped-d tuning is awesome. i've got the hang of most of "forty six and two" and "aenima". and i've got bits of "the grudge", "stinkfist", and "hooker with a penis". this a complete change in my guitar playing routine. i usually just stick to experimenting... but lately learning tool riffs seems to be the way to go. tool is so great. and being able to hear their punishing riffs explode through my tiny amplifier like some kind of new age spatial audio semen aimed at fertilizing the egg in your feeble brain is an orgasmic pleasure that words can't describe. cower and fear motherfucker.  i got the new radiohead EP, and it rules.

      so i passed out today. i had to do a blood test. the nursed asked me if i was doing fine, and i was... but then he put some of my blood in front of me... and either the sight of my blood or just being drained caused me to go down... i got all sweaty and i was just down with a needle still in my arm... they gave me some water and put me on a bed for a couple minutes...

      i'm all alone. again. i got really lonely tonight. i don't like being alone at night on the weekend. it makes it feel like it's not the weekend at all. i got kinda sad about it. it reminded me of when i was in the hospital with asthma when i was younger. and i'd have to spend so much time by myself in strange hospital rooms. just thinking about how i felt when i was in the hospital brings tears to my eyes. i hated being in the hospital because there was nothing to do, no one to hang with, it smelled, and it was just suffocating. at least i managed to get stuff done for a change. and i even had time to read (for fun). i'm reading "the catcher in the rye" by j. d. salinger. it's pretty good so far.  switching gears... i just want to say i hate it when chicks call me "hun" or "honey". it's annoying. especially since these are the types of chicks that only talk to me when they need something from me. they're nice and all, but very motive-oriented. and i could do without them.  i also hate when people falsely claim to love me. not long ago this chick told me she loved me, and i bluntly told her "no you don't". people are so full of shit.   i also have huge disdain for hypocrisy. hypocrites can choke on their lump of coal (and their own dicks while they're at it). motherfuckers who talk one way, and walk another. fuck you. i hope you fucking reap the rewards of your lies. one day, your shit-filled life will catch up with you and eat you from the inside out... yeah... figure that shit out... because i sure as hell can't...

      rammstein makes me think of the nihilists from the big lebowski... vee donne beeleeve een nuzzingh...  i went to vote today. if you don't vote, i hope you choke on your lump of coal because it will be your fucking fault that the country has to deal with the legacy of stephen w. bush... i mean stephen harper...  i saw an interesting girl on the way back from my voting adventure. she was listening to music and silently singing along (as i'm known to do). she was really into it... she seemed to be dancing along to it too... and a part of me want to stop her and ask her what that was all about. what was so great that was making her look like an idiot (i'm actually not criticizing her; i know it's hard to tell since i'm critical of everything). i'm not talking about trying to pick her up or anything, who are you kidding?... i just thought she was interesting... but as always when i see someone interesting, i just went along on my way without saying anything. that's too bad. we shouldn't be afraid to do the things we think would be interesting or exciting. we should just go out and do them, and deal with the consequences (in case you're an idiot, i'm not suggesting you go out and do something stupid). i just mean that i often find random people interesting, and it would be cool to meet these random people. but because i figure people give as much of a shit about me as i do about them, they'll probably wig out on me and go fuckin' mental or something... i don't know... it's just too bad because who knows what could come of reaching out to people like that... to be human is to be a stupid self-conscious motherfucker...  and since convocation related activity has forced me to the confines of my bedroom without real human contact since tuesday night, i will now wage war against the sheer idiocy of convocation. before i begin, i apologize for my anger, but i can't help it. i know i come across as this cocky asshole who thinks he knows everything, but i don't. i like to think i have a good take on things, but i'm just as clueless as you. i do try to see through things and try to find meaning and purpose; i don't just blindly go along with societal norms. norms are fucked. when i refer to "you" i include myself in my accusations.   you are weak. you try to attribute some semblance of meaning to your worthless life by marking it with cliched milestones that you've seen in a million teen movies. and you can claim that you go to something like convocation to appease your parents/other interested parties or to celebrate __ years of hard work, but that just makes you even worse. it demonstrates your minimal level of dedication to the cause. what cause, you ask? fuck you. the fuckin' cause man. progress. repeating history is not progressive at all. we need to evolve beyond hollow symbolism and create something genuine. the ceremonial artificiality of events like convocation is a dagger through the heart of st. motherfucker.  i acknowledge that parents/others place some value on meaningless shit like convocation. but don't you see, they've already suffered the wrath of the demon. it's your duty to fight these seemingly insurmountable obstacles to attempt to forge a better future. one where we don't strive for manufactured memories and conveyor belt existences. most will say i'm an asshole for not taking my parents to convocation. and to them i say, "fuck you". i'm doing this for their and my own good. there is no enlightenment to be achieved by congregating in a room full of motherfuckers you don't give a shit about, who don't give a shit about you, and who you will never ever see again in your life. it's artificial and i won't stand for it. all i ask is that you analyze things on a basic level. ask yourself what is to be achieved from this? what is the value of this? i'm not telling you not to celebrate or acknowledge your accomplishment. i am saying that i'd much rather you did it in a way that actually means something and not in some stereo-typed superficial context.  i know, you probably think i'm full of shit, and i probably am. i'm just trying to give you a window from which to understand the way i look at things. you're a big kid, you figure it out for yourself. do what makes you happy. just know that i will forever be analyzing your every move. so for fuck's sake, make it a good one.

      warsawpack r.i.p.  for fuck's sake. this is twice now that a band that means a lot to me has called it quits (and both were from hamilton; what the fuck is up with that?). this really makes me sad since warsawpack really showed a lot of promise, they kicked so much ass live, they are my favourite band currently, and i will never forget my interview with lee, the singer (which you can find at  urlLink http://radio2.feds.ca/aok/audio.php ). what can i say? after every warsawpack show i was left with this incredible feeling that i can't even describe. it was just this tranquility that consumed me. it's just another reminder that good musicians will always get fucked by people too brain dead to listen. it's also a reminder of how nothing lasts forever. everything is temporary because it will inevitably die and wither away one day, so you'd better savour it all right now. take a fuckin' chance and stop being so fuckin' complacent.   i miss you already warsawpack. thanks for putting out two wicked CDs and putting on shows that blew me away every time. good luck with whatever it is you decide to do. and people, give independent music some fuckin' respect.

      this update comes from the front lines of a seemingly endless war i wage with motherfuckers who crave the warmth of corporate cumshots from executive dicks. i hope they choke on their diet of pennies and jizz. there's so much about the world that i do not and will not understand. i crave simplicity and often question if i will ever find it. day-in, day-out, i deal with another motherfucker trying to feed me the same brand of bullshit in a new box. i've developed a disturbing pain in my chest and i'm too lazy to get it checked out. hopefully it's just indigestion and not my inevitable ulcer. when i'm really pissed off i really like listening to something really heavy and intense. i work out all my frustations just by listening to aggressive music. popping in a cd into my discman is like sticking a heroine syringe into my arm. hail satan and the power of high voltage rock.

      the world is one fucked up place and i am just a fucked up citizen. i don't get people and sometimes i don't even get myself. many months ago i was in a heated argument with a girly girl drama queen "friend" of mine, let's call her "kristyn" (note: that's not her name, but an alias, taken from a lovely girl who i had the good sense to let loose because she talked to me on the phone too much; that's a story for another day). i say that because the definition of our relationship was always questionable, we were never really friends, but then at times it felt like we were really close.   she had a tendency to be a bitch, and i never had a problem telling her what i thought of her. i don't know. in so many ways she embodied so much of what i hate in other people. she was just another disciple of this plastic world i constantly bitch about. but there were other times, when i'd have serious conversations with her and i really thought she was cool on the inside. that deep down she wasn't the imbecile i had her pegged to be. i was ridiculed and mocked for being attracted to her, and i denied it. but deep down... i had this sick fascination with her. i hated her and despised her... but i'd be lying if i said that there wasn't something about her bitchniness that i found appealing... and chicks that dig nin, manson, and tool get a lot of points... but because of the persona she presented, i could and would never ever pursue what was occasionally there. besides, kristyn is a girlie girl and i'm rockstar... we were and always will be worlds apart... there was a small part of her that i really appreciated... i liked the kristyn i saw, but that was an infrequent character... like i said... she's a drama queen... and a porn star... anyway... i said shit to her, not pulling any punches, and just let her have it... i told her what i thought of her ways one day... and i was right... and she blew up at me... and that was it... the point of no return... every time i saw her after that all i ever got was this cold and distant death stare that would pierce through me like the bright sun causes momentary blindness... you feel dead for an instant... if she could kill me with her stare, i swear she would...  months later, i randomly ran into her today. thinking she was a girl who looked like kristyn, i was ready to walk by her. then she started to wave at me. and i was in complete shock. we had this crazy conversation. and she was completely reborn. she was recanting on her death bed, she was an alcoholic reconciling with the people she'd hurt, she was a junkie in rehab, she had found jesus, allah, and buddha hanging out at a pool hall... it was like nothing had ever happened. like she never tried to kill me with her eyes. she seemed genuine. and serene. and kinda high. she even said that my words actually forced her to reassess herself and the life she was living. whether she was saying that to appease me, i'll never know. i'm glad to know that she at least acknowledges that i was trying to help her.  the funny thing is that her fire was what made her attractive. it was her over-the-top anger that made me like her. i miss the old kristyn, but wish well to the new one.

      mos def is the greatest mc ever. if you don't know him, check him out right now. the album "black on both sides" is insane and so is his colloboration with taleb kweli, "blackstar". i rarely enjoy a rap/hiphop cd from start to finish, but mos def knows how to put a record together. it's a crazy mix of soul, r and b, rap, hip hop, funk, jazz, and even some rock... mos def is mos definitely the greatest... his lyrics aren't shit... his music is original... and if that doesn't float your boat... this motherfucker's been on broadway... what can i say? listen to the dude. my favourite tracks are "definition/reDEFinition" and "mr. nigga"... dammit i need new mos def... his last album came out in 1999...

      this is one of my favourite songs ever. and my friend wants me to turn it up. but he likes to fondle my genitals. i appreciate a good fondling of my genitals... but i like to be aware and i like to want them to be fondled prior to the actual fondling... memories are great...  so i'm basically done my masters degree. it wasn't so bad i guess. a lot of bullshit for nothing. but at least i'm done. i'm moving home in like nine hours, and i'm currently typing this on my friend's laptop while drunk on white russians. the dude drinks white russians exclusively (also known as caucasians)... i stole it from the dude, and now everyone has embraced the power of the white russian (a shot of vodka, a shot of kahlua, and a shot of cream)... good times... i love my friends a lot, and i hope they know that. i'd do pretty much anything for them.  i have a new catch phrase: "not true"  today was my last night out before i start studying hardcore for the ufe. fucking dicks. i did realize something awesome today though. ufe prep work is like homeland security. ufe prep makes the ufe sound like this scary thing just like homeland security makes terrorism out to be this big deal. both are obstacles, but definitely overhyped. fuck george bush. fuck him up his stupid born again ass.

      role conflict? role ambiguity? conflict of interest? inner turmoil? call it what you will, it's the eternal struggle of the heart and the mind. mortal enemies who don't care about the external impact of their ideological differences. their objective is to simply pull at opposite ends of a tug of war. i feel like an unfortunate&nbsp;casualty of this war.   bombs... droppin' down... please forgive our hometown... and our... insignificance... it's innocent to want to live.

      so little time, so much to write about. why the fuck am i writing anything really? i've spent the whole day writing crap for a take home exam.   this weekend was awesome. we went to a conservation area and got some long overdue fresh air. that place rocked. and i went canoeing for the first time ever. i was concerned that we were going to tip over, but we didn't have many problems other than crashing into the rocks every now and then. man i can't wait to go back there.   also, i met my friend's two-year old daughter (no thanks to courtney love). man this kid was awesome. it's been a while since i've hung out with a little kid, and i've totally forgotten how cool they are. the innocence and purity of&nbsp;a child makes you forget about all the shit in this fucking world. all they have to do is smile or laugh and it can make your day. i still don't think i could ever have a kid, but man, trying to get her attention was so much fun.   seriously switching gears, i wanted to present my theory (well i say it's my theory, but for all i know, someone else might have already come up with this concept) that all social progress is artificial and is the direct result of the advancement of corporate interests. i want to propose that the elimination of racism, sexism, homophobia, censorship, poverty, etc. has never had and never will have anything to do&nbsp;with a genuine altruistic attempt to create social progress. societal norms change because they service the needs of corporate interests to increase revenue or decrease expenditure. corporations are socially neutral in the sense that they do not intrinsically care about social progress. their concern is purely monetary, and they will support policies, legislation, regulation, agendas that create the greatest amount of wealth for them. this is not an ethical judgement of corporations, since we already know that corporate executives are soulless motherfuckers. the point is that our alleged success is superficial, and&nbsp;that deep down, these social&nbsp;issues are highly unresolved.&nbsp;keep in mind that this is just a crackpot theory that i came up with no empirical research whatsoever. i was reading an article about some dude who founded the "explicit lyrics" rating on albums, and that got me thinking. why can i hear the good lads in slipknot scream "i want to slit your throat/and fuck the wound/i want to push my face inside/and feel the swoon"? with no parental warning on the album no less? why is no one making a big deal about violent lyrics like that anymore? how can record companies get away with putting stuff like that out there into the marketplace? have we evolved as people to the point where we can segregate the realm of artistic expression and the catharsis of the listening experience from the real world? fuck no. people still think that listening to lyrics like that means you're going to go to a high school and shoot some classmates. the catalyst for such&nbsp;"progress" is profit. profit is the catalyst for artificial social&nbsp;progress, and in the process acts as a diversion from the reality that our social problems and issues are just as unresolved as ever. just a thought from a pretentious prick.

      so i had some interesting encounters with strangers over the last day or so, so i thought i'd share them: &nbsp; #1: the telemarketer &nbsp; telemarketer: hello sir, how are you this evening? me: uhhh... i'm in a bit of a crisis... telemarketer: oh... telemarketer: sorry to interrupt your life... &nbsp; moral of the story: always claim to be in a crisis situation when you want to be left alone. &nbsp; #2: bicycle steve &nbsp; me: (walking with the new prodigy cd blarring; oblivious to the world around me) bicycle steve: (cylcing towards me from behind) bicycle steve: HELLO! me: (obviously startled, thinking what the fuck?) bicycle steve: hey man, how's it going? me: alright i guess, you? bicycle steve: my name's steve (extends hand to shake mine) me: nice to meet you steve bicycle steve: where you going? me: home bicycle steve: i'm going HOME! (note the fact he didn't say "too") me: right on bicycle steve: so yeah... umm... uh... i gotta go... (he cycles away) me: (thinking what the fuck?) &nbsp; moral of the story: sometimes people are just fucked...&nbsp;

      as guitarist rick jackett&nbsp; once wrote on the back of my shirt "finger eleven is not your penis". man that was such a long time ago. almost 4 years ago actually. jesus (you said it man). anyway, the finger five are great guys who i've been fortunate enough to meet a couple times and see tons of times. so it's great to be seeing them again tomorrow night&nbsp;(despite the fact that i hate "one thing", although it sounds much better live). i wish they'd play rare stuff like "sad exchange" or "slow chemical" or "daaam". but that's just me.

      today i learned a sad and important lesson. i learned that if anything is to come of my pathetic little journey that i call a life, it all depends on me and no one else. i am on my own. no one can or will have the ability to help me figure out what i need to do. it's all up to me, and ultimately i can't count on anyone to help me get there. that's not a shot at people i care about, it's the reality that i'm faced with. one of the most depressing things i experience is when i realize i can no longer talk to a specific person about anything. that they do not see things from the same perspective or in the same light. that i can't count on them. that i have to retreat further into my shell. that i have to keep my life to myself.

      caffeine is a filthy whore that fucks your brains out. she doesn't love you and you know you hate her, but you never wanted anybody more than you want her. even when you swear you're through with her vicious head games, you think of her seductive aroma. it penetrates your nasal cavity, incapacitating all other senses. you taste her one last time. and then you won't look back. but it's never that easy. she has a hold on you. she knows that you need her more than she needs you. in fact, she doesn't need you. she despises you. she rapes you from every orifice and makes it impossible for you to go on without her. she leaves you empty and scarred. but you can't help it. all the pain and torture is worth it for that momentary post-coital relief. the way she breaths life into your empty soul, the way she caresses you with her eternal warmth, the way she's always waiting to spread her legs for you. it all comes at a price... that bitch... that fucking bitch...
