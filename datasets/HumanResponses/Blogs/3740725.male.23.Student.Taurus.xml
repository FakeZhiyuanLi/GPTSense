      I am getting quite disturbed by the political situation in my country. As I see it, we are in a hopeless deadlock situation. The two large political parties have started to pick up fights on every issue imaginable. They are employing muscle power to cling on to their positions and also for making illegal money. Because of weak governance, terrorists and muslim extremists have become very brave and now are comducting their operations openly (in many areas with the help of the police themselves!!!) Police have become so corrupted and the politicians have become so dependent on terrorists to hang on to power that the whole law and order situation has become a matter of joke to the general people. Before, the terrorists used to lie low but see what has transpired recently, they tried to and almost succeeded to kill the British High-Commissioner in Bangladesh. What a country and what a time we live in! The country is run by illiterate and politically blind people, who have become Godfathers( Mario Puzo huh!) themselves. The chief advisor of prime minister returns home after a shameful defeat and facing the onslaught of critisisms from the opposition leader, he says the most disgusting and ugly things about her in front of national press. Even an illiterate rickshaw-puller would be ashamed to say such things about a lady in front of a press, no matter how much offended he may be. That's all. I see no hope for this country at this point. "The RAZAKARS", who cospired and killed many people of our country and served the Pak army in 1971, are becoming important players in politics( in fact they have ministers in the govt. he he he). That's all from me for today. bye.

      I am very interested about gmail. Like millions of others, I am awed by the search technology of google. As a computer science student I take my hats off to its innovators. I also think like their search engine their e mail system will be also a killer app. Somehow I was never pleased with yahoo mail. Don't know what was wrong with it. But it never caught my imagination. Hotmail's new design is pleasing, I hope that google will also have a soothing look. bye for now.

      WELL, WELL, ENGLAND IS OUT OF EURO 2004. THIS WAS A FANTASTIC MATCH TO WATCH AND ALL THE GOALS THAT WERE SCORED WERE BEAUTIFUL. THE AUDACIOUS MICHAEL OWEN BACKFLICK, THE FURIOUS RUI COSTA DRIVE AND THE LAMPARD GOAL AT PRESSURE SITUATION, WILL MAKE THIS GAME A PART OF FOOTBALL HISTORY. THOUGH THERE WAS THE CONTROVERSIAL DECISION OF DISALLOWING AN ENGLAND GOAL, WHICH WOULD HAVE PUT THEM THROUGH SURELY, I THINK PORTUGAL PLAYED BETTER ATTACKING FOOTBALL. ENGLAND PLAYED WITH THE SAME SORT OF COUNTER ATTACK STRATEGY THEY EMPLOYED AGAINST BRAZIL IN 2002 WORLDCUP AND THEY PLAYED THEIR PRICE. YOU CAN'T WIN BIG MATCHES BY JUST TRYING TO CONTEND THE OPPOSITION. WELL BEING A BRAZIL SUPPORTER I WAS ECSTATIC AFTER THEIR MATCH AND I WAS ALSO VERY HAPPY LAST NIGHT AFTER THE PORTUGAL WIN. THEY MIGHT RODE THEIR LUCK A BIT BUT THEY PLAYED A GOOD ATTACKING GAME AND DESERVED TO WIN.

      I saw "Mystic River" last night. A very well directed, acted and written movie. Sean Penn was excellent as always. But I thought his acting in "I am Sam" was far far better than this one. In fact to me his acting in "I am Sam" was one of the best performances I will ever see along with Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Those are actings that will stand against the test of time. Now back to Mystic River, this was a good movie but it reminded me of the same feelings I had after watching "Unforgiven". These movies gave me an empty feeling, like there was not enough interesting or captivating material in them to actually make them memorable. So everybody can watch it if they wish. It's a good movie but not a very striking one I guess.
