      What is with women that are obviously way overweight all weighing 140 lbs on their IDs?  I have seen many people that are 140 lbs and they aren't fooling anyone.  Many of them are well over 200 lbs.  I have no problem with overweight people but being that insecure that you lie on your liscence with a very non-believable number.  Thats just silly.

      A bear was recently discovered passed out on the from Baker Lake Resort in Washington. Around the bear many empty cans of Rainer Beer were found scattered around. Supposedly the bear had broken into camper's coolers to get his supply of his alcohol. It wasn't just any alcohol though, this bear had passed on Busch after trying one can and went with Rainer beer. "This shows this bear is an experienced drinker and knows what he likes," Fish and Wildlife enforcement Sgt. Bill Heinck. I agree with the bear that Busch light is a subpar tasting beverage and this can only hurt the beer company in the long run. Rainer beer on the other hand got a ringing endorsement from the bear world, "depressed and lonely out in the wilderness? Well its time to get F-ed up. Make yours a Rainer Beer. Bears everywhere prefer it on taste." When a tally was taken 36 beers in all were consumed. A round of applause is deserved for such a large consumption.  This incident makes you wonder what the real motivation was for such an occurance. Perhaps it was just thirst but with a large body of water nearby that seems doubtful. Perhaps the bear just had a taste for beer. I think the bear was depressed. 36 beers, whether you like the taste or not, is defined as drowning ones sorrows. This bear was depressed. Perhaps the bear was having trouble finding a mate, perhaps the bear had just lost a close relative/friend. This bear really deserves our help. So if you wish to lend a helping hand we are throwing a singles party for bears on September 3rd at the old Fireman's Lodge in Baker's Lake Resort. There will be a $10 cover charge at the doors which will give you all you can drink of Rainer Beer. If you wish to help out with organization of the envent please give the Washington Wildlife and Game Reserve a call at 1-800-534-9999.

      Tonight I watched a haunting movie entitled Elephant which was done by Gus Van Sant.   It is a highly regarded independent film that was released in 2003.   I think it is supposed to be a take on the Columbine High School tragedy, either that or a fictional occurance of a very similar event at another school.  It really doesnt matter though.  The film in my opinion is very flawed and at times poorly constructed.   I was disappointed in a way given the high critical acclaim but on the same note found the film incredibly moving and realistic.    I find myself sitting afterward thinking back on the high school days from my time and how children of that age are.  They are exactly as I stated children, something we seem to often forget.   We put enormous pressure on the children of today to become adults at younger and younger ages.  I think back to my times as a teenager and how important but unimportant that times were.   I made many "mistakes" which if you listen to those guiding us will lead you down the path of self destruction.   I don't see it as that.  I think you learn more from your choices as a teenager than any time in your life.  It does play a role in your future developement but not such a role that you can't recover from a mistake as we seem to lead this generations children to believe.   Thinking back to those times, I just keep thinking how young I really was, despite myself really not recognizing it at the time.  I have done so much growing since high school ended and now its almost a seperate life-time.  Perhaps its the pressures being put on our youth to achieve, to be adults, that leads to them snapping.   When you feel the burdon of the rest of your life on your shoulders when you aren't really mature its tough to take on that heavy burdon of responsibility of choices.   In a way such pressure stunts the developement of one as a person because we expect them to be there already.  In modern times its more important than ever to really try to understand our youth as youth.  There are more destructive things out there than ever and if a mistake is made teach them that they can use that mistake to learn from.  They can use it to mold them into who they really want to be.  An F is not the end of the world but a growing pain.   There are options to find your way down the path you wish to follow no matter how it started that.   I really hope if or when I become a father that I am able to remember such rules and really can help guide my children's developement and not push them to be the person I want them to be.  Everyone is beautiful in their own way.  Appreciate that along with embracing it.  *Goodnight*

      If you ask around something like 95-100% of people out there will answer the following question with a yes; "Do you believe government officials lie for self-gain?" It should be 100% because this is a proven fact. I would hope that its not all the elected officials out there doing it but I can say that there is definate agenda as a whole within the political party system. It makes me wonder when something as simple as the weapons of mass destruction and Iraq question is brought up. I hear over and over on the news the invasion being validated because along with the CIAA; French, British, and Russian intelligence all told us that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction yet if my memory serves me correctly the United Nations had been in Iraq looking and had said they had found none to this point and wanted to keep looking. The US government ignored what the United Nations said and decided to go ahead which was an enormous error of judgement. When you have two sources of information disagreeing you must weigh both and if you choose the wrong you must admit it. The United Nations argument was conveniently forgotten by the US media though while validating the Iraq invasion with these other intelligence sources. As many leaks in the high places have stated the real reason for the Iraq invasion was our dependency on the oil reserves there. This holds true to all of our relationships and policies in the middle east. Given the rising gas costs this would almost be deemed a resonable explanation by the masses if our government would just be honest with us.  While conscious manipulation in my eyes qualifies as lying, others in the media mainly, seem to give this a pass. While intentions are obvious in such situations such as the current US adminstration's attempts to link the connections between Sadaam and Bin Ladin, things like these are given a pass. The adminstration says they never implied any such things and the media says thats good enough. Elected officials and their advisors are intelligent and experts at what they are doing but aren't held to any liability when they manipulate the masses. Anyone who does try to hold them to any sort of responsibility is labeled a liberal nutcase and tossed to the wolves, ie. Michael Moore, despite all the evidence out there. Even the "liberal" party that is the democrats refuses to talk about this and outcasts people who do. So who should be held accountable that we let things come this far? I think everyone from the government officials, the media, teachers, and us as citizens ourselves should be blamed. Afterall anyone who consciously realizes what is going on has a responsibility to act on it.  Back to as what personal gain the government officials could be getting under their current direct manipulations of the masses they could possibly just take a look at the previous posts that each official held before becoming a politician.  There is a strange coincidence between policies and how they benifit the companies previous government officials held as CEOs or were on the board of directors of.  Another thing that needs to be observed is where campaign funds come from for candidates.  Often times they make promises to coorperations in order to gain financing often times dealing with foreign policy, tax breaks, polution laws, labor laws, all of which sell out the protections of regular citizens.  Demand the truth.  Thats all for now.

      Every person out there is born with a unique perspective on how we see things.   What may be hideous to one is sheer beauty to another.  It all goes down to the quote "beauty is in the eyes of the beholder."  Many out there are insecure on their idea of beauty or life in general and turn to others to find the answers.  They seek approval for the things they do, the people they like, how they act, instead of following their hearts and instincts and they wonder why as they grow older they are never able to find happiness.   We are all filled with a bit of insecurities with ourselves and hope for some sort of vindication but with the instinctive perspectives of individuals of beauty there is a natural balance out there and you will find your place if you just believe.  A not-so-famous songwriter once wrote "I wanted to show you something beautiful but I couldn't show you yourself through my eyes."

      Ignorance is an easy word to describe us all.  We sit back and let things around us happen that contradict our morals, values, and our own self exhistence.  Its easy to say you believe in a cause, you believe in a feeling, you believe in hope but if you dont walk a path that shows just that, you are living a lie.  We all fall on tough times where we may stray from who we are but its the outcomes of times like this that define who we are.   Do we turn our backs on who we are because we are afraid to really find out the truth about what monstrosities we are part of.  I myself am sickened by who I am when I look at some of the choices I have made.  Its such a disgust that allows me to understand who I am and become a better man.   Open your eyes, be a better person.  There is shit going on all around you at every level.  Dont turn your back if you see something that is wrong.  Turn and face the demons and make the difference.  This momment could define you forever.
