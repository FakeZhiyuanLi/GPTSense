      The Passion of the Christ is on for today.  Going with Rob, Tom and possibly Matthew.  After that, Dane is coming over and we are going to work on stats.    For somone who is single my life is getting full of people.  I thought I was suppose to stay at home with the lights out and listen to Ani DiFranco and drink whiskey.  But, not tonight.  Maybe tomorrow.  There is always a tomorrow - until you die!

      Why am I so enthralled with "Lost in Translation"?  Why is Bill Murray such a captivating actor in that picture?  Do I see myself in Murray's role?  The irony, the sardonic, eccentric, wry and scornful character up there cuts a little too close to the bone for me.  Being in a foreign country and having that kind of connexion with someone also touched a nerve.  He choked it to be honest.  In a sea of people and to be more alone than anywhere else or any other time in your life I could connect with.  To meet someone - out of desparation but, changing so naturally is touching.  The final two or three scenes are spectacular.  The ironic betrayal of sleeping with lounge singer and the lunch the next day with Johannsson was brilliant!  It underscored the tension between the two so well!  The scene when he is leaving and just drops the gorgeous blonde to talk to Johannsson shows just how much of a better man and soulmate Murray is to Johannsson than Giovanni will ever be.   The final scene - when he goes back and whispers something into her ear was heart wrenching.  The connexion, the pure love and specialness and healing of it all was just too much.  I see too much of myself in this film.  The parrallels as well as the could haves, should haves, would haves etc...  I just sat there for awhile thinking of my own life.  And quietly left my own Toyko.

      Today marks Lent.  It is Mardi Gras.  What should I give up?  What should I atone for?  I have lots to atone for.  Chocolate, liquor, women.... they all don't mean all that much to me.  Perhaps doughnuts or videogames or music.  Help me out on this.

      What does it mean to evolve?  What does it all mean?  I think Rudyard Kipling said it best in becoming a man:  If you can keep your head when all about you   Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you   But make allowance for their doubting too,   If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,   Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,    Or being hated, don't give way to hating,   And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:    If you can dream--and not make dreams your master,   If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim;   If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster    And treat those two impostors just the same;   If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken   Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,   Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,    And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:    If you can make one heap of all your winnings   And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss,   And lose, and start again at your beginnings    And never breath a word about your loss;   If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew   To serve your turn long after they are gone,   And so hold on when there is nothing in you    Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"    If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   Or walk with kings--nor lose the common touch,   If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;   If all men count with you, but none too much,   If you can fill the unforgiving minute   With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,   Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,   And--which is more--you'll be a Man, my son!

      I have been in the office for a good 8 hours now.  I got some work done.  I've mostly been playing on the internet and procrastinating.  I am getting an outline done for my Urban Reserves paper.  I might go and have some tea or coffee at Williams.  I like the tea there.    I've stored or destroyed most things that belong or remind me of women yesterday and today.  It was a good exercise.  I feel - cleansed - not in the creepy ethnic way but, in the calm, warm and fuzzy philosophical way.  I am free!

      Exhibit F  This will be an on-going section of my blog.  Whenever I find some "scientific" evidence that proves my theory that, women are the devil, I will be posting it under "Exhibit F."  The "F" is for female in case there are some people out there that are a little confused.  Anyway, onto the first exhibit.   urlLink Warren Payne  has written a song about how Women Are The Devil:  They walked into the bar, looked like trouble had come  Three lovely looking ladies, the men were all stunned  They walked up to me and they said with a smile  “We’re looking for fun, want to spend a little while with me”  Let me tell you  I said, “What do you want,” and I poured her some wine  She said, “You and your friends will do just fine.”      CHORUS:  Women are the devil  Women are the devil  Women are the devil and that ain’t no dig  I said women are the devil and men are pigs       The next thing I know, my buddies and me  Are talking and a laughing with those ladies three  Some of us smoked and some of us danced  Then I looked at my lady she said, “Take a chance with me.”  Take a chance  She said you’re kinda cute and you’re kinda fun  I bet I’m going to love you when it’s all said and done    All of my life I tell you I’ve been told  You got to watch the devil or he’ll take your soul  But they never told me ‘bout these ladies three  No they never told me how good it could be      Next thing I knew I was falling in love  She looked just like an angel from heaven above  One look in her eyes so deep and so brown  I begged and I pleaded, “Baby, stick around with me.”  Don’t you go  She said, ‘The only place I’m going, I’m going with you”  Then she gave me a grin, give the devil her due

      I have arrived early at the office today.  I awoke at 4:30AM and turned over and realized that I should be getting ready to go to Ohio but, I realized that there is no point.    I phone American Airlines and they will not give me a refund but, will let me re-use the ticket at any time.  I really didn't need that.  I went back to sleep and woke again at 7AM.  I didn't know what to do today.  Sould I go to work?  Should I got to the LCBO?  Should I just stay in bed?  No, I am not defeated!  No, I can't afford liquor!  So, off to work I go.  The upside is that I found that I can finally access the internet at my office.  Always a silver lining.  Always.

      Today is a very special day in my life.  Today, my eyes have been opened to this cruel world.  Today, life touched me where I can only show through dolls.  I feel shame, despair, resignation and cold.  I have also decided to dedicate this sewage to the terribly important task of proving, as this blog site is titled, that women are the devil.  This will take research, pain, doughnuts and above all, a cold, hard heart that, thanks to women, I have finally pounded and honed into a weapon.  Enjoy

      Zei Germans are no more!!!!  This is fabulous day.  Today is the last day for the Germans.  They are leaving some time today.  Now, it is not a complete success.  I have one for the summer.  As a bonus, I might be getting another girl living with me for the summer so, a full house once again.  At least they are not Germans.  They were not really all that bad.  I just felt out of the loop when they were talking and watching movies together - in German.    Speaking about Germans - this is a really bad soleloquy - Sir Peter Ustinov pasted away yesterday.  They played an interview of his on Studio 2 last night and he mentioned this one time he was critized by a German reporter about his work for Unicef.  The German reporter said, "What you do is like a rain drop on a hot tile."  Apparently, this is a very pessimistic German expression.  Ustinov's response was, "No, I believe my work is like a rain drop in the Ocean."  Wham!!  He had some other great sayings too.  He talked about being married 4 times and having 4 different children.  He said, "one must risk being happy as much as being unhappy."  And I think the best was about Toronto.  "Toronto reminds me of New York run by the Swiss."  Heart failure in Geneva, Switzerland.  He was 84.

      It is the first good weekend this year.  By good, I mean the weather.  That weekend in Winnipeg was good too but, for none-weather related stuff.  There is a spelling-bee going on campus today.  That is all I think.  I am the only other person who happens to be here to do some work I think.  I didn't see one single person walking here.    I am going to watch hockey with Rob and Yaacov later tonight.  I have until I think 2pm before Rob comes by and we kill time in that time-honoured way - games!  Oh, it is going to be sweet!    I think I might watch Family Guy tomorrow since I am overloaded with fun stuff to do here and now.  I am also pressed for time with these papers and what not.  With the fun that I am going to have tonight, I have to really get cracking on these papers since they are due next week.  The urban paper is going well.  Good rough draft so far, but I have to keep focus. I wander off and talk about self-determination and stuff when really, that is another paper all together.  I got my reading journal done last night too!  I am sooo happy I got that.  It is 55 pages for just one class.  I have read then at least 55 papers or articles or chapters for this Indian course.  It really has opened my mind and heart to what is going on.  I am still a political scientist though - I still want to ask questions that might still be socially taboo but, I am an outsider who has the luxury of doing that - or, am I arrogant and ignorant for being so insenstive?  Or, is that how resisters will portray me for asking questions they might not like the answers too?  This terrible Milner paper will  be done today I think.  It is only 5 pages and I really don't care.  I'll just spew off how great he is and then get at least a decent grade on it.  Grad studies has broken me on that front.  And I feel fine.  Girls suck.  That is the constant!

      Today is the first day of rain this springtime.  Oddly I feel happy to see the rain.  It is nice to see the warm rain beat out the frost; to see the snow melt away; to see people wearing less bulky clothes and more happy faces.  I am still marking these God-awful papers.  My professor wants to review every mark so, it will take some time.  I will give him a few more papers today. I am getting sick of the administrative part of the job.  I enjoy holding tutorials though.  To be challenged and to challenge the minds to not only take it for granted that they are smart but rather, to have an educated mind and to see it develop is rewarding.  Next week is the Grad conference and I am ready for it.  I don't know what I am judging though.  I hope the organizers will let me know ASAP.   Oh, to add to my Exhibit F:  The Passion of the Christ.  I know I went on a rant about that before but, I found proof that once again - women are the devil!  From Mel Gibson, "The woman we cast is very beautiful. I didn’t want the stereotypical devil  with horns. I don’t believe that is how the devil presents himself/herself.  He/she is very seductive and doesn’t put out signposts announcing who he/she  is."

      Things just get *better* in my world.  I have more proof of my law of physics when it comes to girls.    Remember, one of my Laws of Physics for Girls is that if I find a girl attractive, she will inevitably have a boyfriend (either in town or in Mississauga) or has just come off a relationship and doesn't want to be in one (with me specifically since I've tested this theory out).  Tom and I were at Mel's for milkshakes on Saturday and Alyssa came in.  Alyssa is a political science girl who I spent time with last year at the United Nations conference.  She is super smart and I am rather smitten with her.    Well, you know where this is going.  Coming in behind her was her boyfriend.  She introduced me to him and I introduced Tom and exchanged pleasantries.    So, I am sad that I didn't even have a chance with Alyssa but, comforted to know that my Law of Physics for Girls is still going strong.  Prove me wrong!  I dare you!

      I can't stand people.  I really can't.  I got in late last night after working hard on my own papers and I decided to take some tutorial papers home to mark.  I get home and the place is filled - FILLED with Germans making party.  Krauts!  I weasel my way into my room and then turn on the TV to see the Conservative speeches going on.  I try to listen but the laughter from outside in German is strange and distracting.  I also realize that I haven't eaten dinner yet so, I try and get into the kitchen and then of course, they have used all of *my* dishes and pots to make their own dinner.  Krauts!  I had a peanut butter sandwich and a banana with some orange juice and went back into my room to watch the speeches.  After the speeches, and Heartbeat, and Inspector Morse, I managed to mark about 3 or 4 papers until Diplomatic Immunity came on.  After that, it was Studio2 and then sweet, sweet bedtime.  I just ignored the German sounds coming from the living room - and then bedroom!!  Ewwww!!!!  I woke up this morning and wanted to get a crack on those essays.  It was nice and quiet until those Krauts had the same idea and woke up and expected breakfast or something.  They then proceeded to do laundry.  The laundry room is next to my bedroom and when you have that kind of appliances torquing their best - lazly laying in bed is not an option.  I got up and started marking the remainder of my papers.  I can't stand people - I just want some breakfast in peace and quiet; go to the toilet and not have to wait in line and perhaps even play some music with my door open.  It is the small things in life that I miss the most.  I decided to leave my 'home' and head to work - Saturday on campus I can find some peace and quiet non?  Get some marking done and perhaps work on my own projects?  Wrong!!!  I could be no more wrong than Janet Jackson wearing a nipple guard.  I come into the office and Robyn and her friends are working on a project.  I lower my head and decide to check my e-mail - not on my own computer but, in the computer lab - with about 3 or 5 other people in it.  I hate people.  This includes women.

      My office is covered in books.  That makes sense to me.  In fact, the only free space on my desk is where the keyboard is - and that is a stretch!  I got an e-mail from my mom the other night explaining that all my aunts and uncles are in the hospital at the moment for one reason or another.  One has pneumonia, another has a sore shoulder and a third one is going into surgery.  On the lighter side of things, i got my pictures back from Winnipeg and Christmas and they look great.  I like developing pictures and you get them back and they jog some memories.  The pictures of Christmas were nice.  To see all that pure snow and cold.  Winnipeg was a great time and I'll scan in some of those pictures and send them out to friends.  On the darker side of things, I have to start marking these first year papers soon.  I don't want to - they are poorly written and I have better things to do with my life AND I have my own stuff to get done.  I'm paid stupid amounts of money to do this so, I feel obligated to give it a go.  I'll be fair and objective - to a point when I am pressured for time and then I'll just rush threw the rest of them.  I have to plan my april.  I don't know what I should do for fun.  I guess I could just stay around here and work on my thesis.  I know I am going home for Easter.  Sweet, sweet chocolat will rock!  I'll try and get down to Hamilton or Guelph.    Any suggestions?  Buck 65 is playing and I quote from Pants on Fire:  "You want to know the truth?  You know why I don't have a girlfriend?  I could have anybody really  I don't because girls are evil - they stink  They are evil, like you."

      It is St.Patrick's day.  I still feel not so hot but, not as much as I use to over last week.  I am trying to get a good chunk of this paper for Indian politics done.  I have to get something done before I mark papers over the weekend.  Stupid work and deadlines and things.  I want my tummy to feel better.  I want all this work to be done.  I'll go and get some it done somehow.

      I feel absolutely terrible today.  I think I had too much salt on my popcorn last night.  I woke up to nasty stomach pains, dehydration, diarehea and virtigo.  I still made to my office in the afternoon and I am promptly going to take a nap on the floor.  I really do need to get these essays done since I will be swarmed by little people in two weeks time begging for more marks.  Exhibt F!  I found proof that  urlLink She Devils  do exist!

      I've decided to start hating my country - again.  I think it is seasonal hate so, it comes and goes.  It is cold, windy, snowy out today.  The sun is just not enough to keep me from hating my country and the people who inhabit it.  I set goals for myself everyday.  Everyday I come up short.  Maybe I shouldn't set those high goals but, on the other hand, those goals are rather low to begin with.  For example, today I plan on writing up a book review.  That's it!  And I know that it is possible - I did it in my undergrad days.  But now, with the lack of a will to live and my hate on - I just can't get it done.  I need some inspiration, any ideas?

      Toronto, Winnipeg, Hamilton, Kitchener-Waterloo..These are the places I know, I know.  These are the places I know.  This has been a rollercoaster weekend.  Full of laughs, insight, showing and proving my mettle.  I went to the conference, "Intersecting Worlds: Rural and Urban aboriginal in the 21st Century."  I went to Jason Hildebrandt who did his undergrad at UofM and is from Manitoba - shocker!  Arrived in Toronto on time for the WestJet flight to Winnipeg.  Got into the Peg at around 2:30pm and was greeted by one of the MA history students helping out with the conference.  She drove us down Winnipeg and into the south Winnipeg to UofM and where Jason and I stayed with another friend of mine - Sunny.  Sunny's place is fantastic!  Great housemates, great house, great everything!  He is lonely for Ontario though.  I can understand.  Getting to know Toronto so well and then KW and now having to start at another city with, what I think is true - a rather closed MA system - can be difficult.  The conference itself was an eye opener!  Now I know what it is to be an advocate and not an observer.  I was definitely in the observer section and it was lonely.  That's okay, i still think asking these questions are important.  In fact, it was interesting during the Q&A after my talk.  One Aboriginal women told me she felt offended by what I was saying.  I didn't apologize for asking these questions or for using the language that I did use.  If push came to shove and if I wasn't so fucking arrogant I guess I could have pointed out the vast differences in Aboriginal communities versions of self-identity but, I let it slide.  Then, sitting right next to the offended woman was another Aboriginal woman who applauded me for asking these questions everybody is tip toeing around but, are critical to understanding the structure of poverty in the Aboriginal world.  So, mixed reviews are always good.  I came back on Monday and flew into Hamilton.  I got a ride downtown and then walked over to the bus station.  To my horror, the buses run only on Sunday to KW at 9pm and I missed the last bus.  Well, luckily, I had phoned Rob when I landed and so, he was there, laughing at me when I turned from the cashier.  Good friends are compassionate and Best friends are bored on Monday nights.  I have a best friend in Rob - he drove Jason and I to KW.  I treated him to a pint and dinner like a good friend should.  So, an adventure for sure!  I have pictures, i will be developping them and scanning them this weekend.  Should be fun!!

      Okay, enough about the Passion....something else:  Indians!  I'm going to Winnipeg this weekend with Jason.  There is a conference being put on by  urlLink St.John's College  called, "Intersecting Worlds: Urban Aboriginals and Canadian Society."  I found out about this from Sunny who used to be at Waterloo but now is doing his MA at U of M.    I submitted a paper and they liked it so much that they want me to come and give a little talk about it.  I have prepared overheads and a little speaking notes cards for the talk.  I'm all nervous.  I'm more nervous about missing the flight and getting to Toronto and from Hamilton back to KW when I get back on Monday.  I might ask Rob if I can crash at his place Monday or, if he can drive me back to KW.  I'll ask about the crashing part first if the buses have shut down for the day.  Winnipeg is going to rock.  I'll stay with Sunny and with Muad and get a chance to visit family like Marion and Allan.  I'll give my two cents about Urban Indians and their plight while I sit comfortably in a motel room with heating and cable TV.  Ya, I like living in irony.

       urlLink  The Passion , much like every other Easter service and message is deeply emotional and moving. The smug, superficial Canadian public will the numbed when seeing and hearing at first but, like the rest of Easter, will be most likely forgotten in about a week.  I saw the film yesterday.  It was packed for the matinee.  To entertain myself and my friends, I played the game "spot the Christians" in the crowd.  Try to decipher those people who really don't go to movies all that much but, feel compelled to see this movie for either a couple of reasons:  A) The story of Christ's death is at the heart of the Christian faith and so, being Christians themselves, they feel compelled to see it.  B) All the hype about the film being anti-Semitic is just too good to pass up and so, like the lemmings of American sensationalism that they are; will go and see it.  I thought the Christians were easy to pick out but, as the movie progressed, I began to doubt who was in fact Christian or not.  For example, this one middle-aged woman came in late and sat beside me.  I pegged her as a Christian - clean, white, middle-aged with a group of similarly hygienic couples but, got separated.  Very Canadian too.  Middle class, liberally minded, polite, quiet, smug.  The thing that made me doubt was her reaction to the relationship that Jesus had with Mary.  Maybe I'm a man; maybe I didn't get it.  The woman beside me was weeping as the flashback scene of Jesus hurting himself as a child and then coming back to being whipped and beaten by Romans and Mary having to watch it.  Why was this woman weeping at the moment?  It struck me then that, it was because she saw this not as our Saviour paying for our sins but, as a mother weeping and feeling helpless to protect her son.    Maybe this is why Mary is so revered in the Catholic order.  She is the mother not only bore our Saviour but, was strong enough to endure her own torture of being just a mortal.    But, maybe the woman missed the point.  To cry at this one aspect perhaps is to miss the bigger picture that God wanted all this to happen.  Jesus knew his Father wanted all this to happen.  Sensationalism I think missed that.  All the talk of anti-semitism misses that too.  They suppose that the Romans or the puppet Jewish government at the time actually had a choice in their actions.  Have you read the book?    This death and suffering was foretold.  Jesus knew it was coming and nothing - no free choice at all from any People - was going to stop it.    Like all things - the book is always, always better than the movie.  How many of those weeping, numbed Canadians sitting in that movie theatre that day will go home and read John?  I seriously doubt any really did.  I'm one of them.

      I stayed up until 1AM last night finishing Lester Pearson's Memoires Vol. III.  I have never laughed so much and have been kept transfixed by something as boring as diplomatic protocol as I was in this 3 volume set.  It was more than just politics - it was his life.  His upbringing as a Church-going son of a Methodist preacher; the complete serendipity of life and how fortunate he was to be in the right place at the right time and to know the right people in the right places with the right war going on.    Volume III was mostly about his political career as both Prime Minister and as the Official Opposition.  His personal accounts of DeGaulle and Diefenbaker are fascinating!  He never comes out and says it - being the good diplomat that he is but, you know he loathed both of them.  I was touched by his conviction in keeping Canada united and wanting Trudeau to run and then run again - as leader.  I keep comparing his leadership to that of Chretien - he isn't mentioned in the memories.    I laughed out loud in the comparison of when Pearson decided to leave office.  Paul Martin (Sr.) wanted the leadership and Pearson hinted that he shouldn't run (he knew that Martin would not win and he didn't).  A generation later, Paul Martin (Jr.) has the reigns I wonder how much of an impact his father really was.  Seeing the same Flag with Jr. that Sr. had at his State funeral confirms that ambition and a need for power runs very deep in that family.  Speaking of the Flag - what a fascinating thing to read about.  I take it for granted that we have the red Maple Leaf.  I never understood how painstaking it was to create that simple Flag of ours.  I never realized how silly it all was too!  President of Ireland visited Canada during the Flag War - Mr. De Valera.  I'll quote at length here because, like any Irish story - it must be told in its entirety to get the full effect:  "In conversation after a dinner at Rideau Hall with the Governor General and our wives, he (De Valera) commented: 'You're having a very difficult time, aren't you, young man?' 'I certainly am' (Pearson) answered, 'I'm so politically innocent and naive that I just don't know in advance about these things being difficult, and that's why I do them and don't think about the difficulty.' De Valera continued: 'I don't think, young man, you're going to win this parliamentary struggle.  It is not possible to legislate a flag a design that has no significance and no tradition attached to it.  To get a flag accepted, you have to have blood on it; you have to have waved it fighting somebody.  That's how our flag became accepted.  It was a badge of revolution; it was a badge of victory against the oppressors.' He added: 'You know what you ought to do, you really ought to take your flag down to the American border - it's not that very far away - and get some of your friends on the other side to take some shots at it, and if you can get somebody to be mildly wounded, that will make all the difference.  It will be hallowed emblem of your independence from the United States.'  Pearson told De Valera that he didn't think he could quite manage that.  Coming back to Chretien and leaving office.  It was the exact same feelings and actions taken to actually leave office.  After the convention and Trudeau had selected his Cabinet Pearson was driven by the official chauffeur from parliament to Rideau Hall and all the cameras and photographers and reporters massed around him on the way in.  He told the GG and the swearing in of the new PM and Cabinet commenced and he was suddenly put in the corner.  He left Rideau Hall that afternoon without a single notice and walked back to 24 Sussex Drive.  When Chretien went to Rideau Hall it was the same thing.  He walked in with much fanfare and attention and then simply walked out of Rideau Hall with his wife to his new home in Beachland.  The last thing I would like to quote is his final paragraph in the whole project.  He died of cancer before the completion of the entire volume but, with the work of Munro and Ignilis, the project never missed a beat in its first person narration of historical fact.  "My last personal observation on this long road will concern the night of the press gallery dinner for me.  It was a happy occasion with a good many old friends.  At the conclusion of the evening, I took a taxi home.  I sank back, and began dozing and wondering about the vagaries of life, about what was going to happen now, when I suddenly realized that the driver had gone by the driveway on Sussex Drive.  I banged him on the back and said: 'In there, in there.' The taxi driver turned around and looked at me in a friendly but pitying way: 'Mr. Pearson, you don't live there any more.'  April 23 is his birthday.

      Another Installment of Exhibit "F"  I've been working and pasting these together for awhile.  What is more funny than the actual "rules" is that I've heard of most of these from a lot of people before.  Therefore, my conclusion is that there is not just a coincidence but, a CAUSAL relationship between women and the devil.  I hope you enjoy.  The Rules (by men)     * If we say something that can be interpreted in two ways, and one of those ways makes you sad or angry... we meant the other way.     * Department stores and malls were purposely designed so that when you want to look at bed linen, shower curtains or handbags, there are always some speakers, tires or sporting equipment nearby.       * We don't know ANYTHING about handbags. Please, don't even ask.       * We DID water the plants. They died anyway. Nobody knows why this happens.       * Silence does not always need to be filled with discussions about "us" and "the relationship."       * It is in neither your best interest or ours to take those stupid magazine quizzes together. * Actually, you probably don't want to know what we're thinking about.       * Good things for you to help us with: the Sunday crossword, yard work, the dishes, cleaning, and grocery shopping. * Things you should let us do alone: figuring out where we are, watching anything on TBS, playing cards, and home repair.       * Christopher Columbus didn't need directions and neither do we.       * Curley is the bald one. * Unless you are willing to follow the careers of Cal Ripken, Michael Jordan, or Arnold Schwarzenegger, don't expect us to know what Helen Gurley Brown, Hilary Clinton, or Naomi Wolf are up to.       * Socks never constitute a gift. * Dinner out is a pretty good birthday present. Two tickets to a ball game are even better.       * Two hot dogs and a drink at a baseball game do, in fact, constitute going out to dinner.       * Anything we said six or eight months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All comments become null and void after seven days.       * You can either ask us to do something OR tell us how you want it done-not both. * Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials or time-outs.       * No, you can't have the remote control.       * When we're turning the wheel and the car is nosing onto the off ramp, your saying "This is our exit" is not necessary.

      That was quick to find a place for the fall.  Granted, there was only one person who fit my criteria and as luck would have it - the place was still available!  So, come September, I will be at 50 Columbia St. in Waterloo, Ontario.  Some people who read this blog might be aware of 52 Columbia.  Well, I will spare you the anticipation of seeing the place - it is an EXACT replica of 52.  It was like being in Bizarro world on Seinfeld.  The kitchen was clean and sky blue, Jesse's room was still a mess but, another looser was in it.  The living room had bad leather couches and the TV and Rob's room is where they store their hockey gear ;)  I am happy that I got that done with.  I don't have to stay on the farm this fall; I don't have to stay on the streets this fall; I can concentrate on my thesis from now on.  It is all coming together.  I just hope that I don't end up with retards.  We can only hope - this is Waterloo afterall.

      It is Friday.  Yesterday was the last day of exams.  Political Science had exams right up to the end - last day, last slot for exams.    I went out with Matt and Niki after the final exam and saw the Leafs blow up in Philly.  I always said, I will always say, Belfour is overrated.  Although, Philadelphia did what Ottawa couldn't - get under Belfour's skin.  Belfour just lost it last night and it showed on the scoreboard.  He pulled a Lalime!  That was the low-light of the night.  We had to share the place with some Iranian sports team having their team dinner and party so they played cards and stuff.  The highlight was that I went to the used book sale and picked up Mike Volume III.  It was just laying there - the first book I saw in the whole place.  I instantly picked it up and paid the 5 cents for it.  Perfect condition.  My trilogy is now complete.  I've already started to read it and it rocks!!  Pearson is the best Canadian of all time.  He has everything: sports hero, war hero, political hero, English guy that Quebekers liked; Ontario guy that Westerners liked; Canadian diplomat that got beat up by Johnson for speaking his own mind about an American war that went too far - does any of this sound familiar??  He brought in the AutoPact - much better than NAFTA we have now.  He brought in the CPP.  He brought in the Flag!  He stuck up for Canada in WWII and then again during the Cold War.  He invented Peacekeeping.  He turned down being the first Secretary General of the United Nations to serve his country and be with his family more (Jebb was the first).  He was considered again to be Secretary General when Trygve Lie resigned in the early 1950s but, politics worked its magic and international order decided that Dag HammarskjÃ¶ld would be better.  Best Canadian Ever!

      Ottawa lost last night to Toronto - again.  Patrick Lalime had a nervous breakdown before going on the ice and couldn't stop anything - EVER AGAIN!    He lost the confidence of his teammates that night.  Dark night for Lalime.  I hope he made it through the night.  I watched the game with Dane and company in Guelph.  We played CivIII a little in the morning and had a nice walk around campus before my bus back to Kitchener.  It is now raining and I don't want to walk home in this mess.  Dane is thinking about moving to Kitchener for the summer.  He and Berger want to live apart for awhile.  Understandable - Berger hasn't lived on his own ever and he does need his own space.  I offered my place for the summer since it is vacant and we will see how that all works out.  I should face the elements and go outside.  I don't want to though.  I want to stay warm and dry!!  But, I am tough; I am a grad student!

      Monday, 9AM:  I thought it was going to rain!!  That is the only reason I wore my black overcoat today.  I feel like some outcast Goth highschool student now.  I'm playing Billy Joel's Opus CD.  That's right Mr. Piano Man has done classical music!  And it is good to boot.  I like to set goals for myself every week.  Not big ones but, attainable goals.  I think this week I will put my Winnipeg Conference paper to the test and polish it up and send it to Winnipeg so it can be published over this fall.  That is an attainable goal.  Another one would be to watch the Boston-Montreal game tonight and Toronto-Ottawa game on Tuesday.  Attainable goal again!  I have to buy envelopes and stamps and write letters.  I haven't written a letter in a few months.  It is a craft that I like to do.  Reading all this crappy handwriting from final exams has given me a new found fondness for penmanship.  I'll try to get mine down clearly.  That is about it.  I lead a boring life.  A safe and comfortable life and for that I am thankful.

      I think in the hustle and bustle of the Easter holidays and marking and getting terrible, terrible papers back, I forgot to mention yet another plank in my platform that Women are the Devil.  It all began with the UW Grad Conference the week before exams began.  I was doing my little speech regarding my research and there were plenty of questions at the end of the talk.  One girl (devil) came up to me afterwards and is actually doing similar research at Guelph in their MA programme in political science.    We got to talking about Aboriginals and politics and policy and we really hit it off.  It was just a one day conference so, she went back to Guelph but we continued to MSN and e-mail and there was some mutual interest.  You know the kind I'm talking of - the laughing the smiling and nodding the winking - chemistry at the conference and we found more similarities later on.  So, when I asked if we should get together after marking finals and stuff I was expecting a bubbly yes but, she said no.  I was startled and confused since we hit it off so well.  She informed me that she is torn at the moment because she has been thinking about girls more and more of late and is wishing that her next relationship would be with a girl.  To recap - I've been now rejected for just the *possibility* of having a lesbian relationship.  I feel special now.

      I am now done with most things requiring class work.  My last night class was last night and let me tell you - hell was looking good.  We had it at the Grad House and there was no beer involved.  That was the first mistake.  The second mistake was putting on the hockey game.  The third was having the night class at all.  Well, we had to go around the table and tell everybody what the best piece of social science we had read that year was.  Just before going into this claptrap he handed back two papers that we handed into him in January and February.  Now, these were revised papers that the whole class had to re-write over Christmas from out initial writings in December.  So, I was under the assumption that we had to improve on what we had written before.  I got mine back and I actually lowered my mark with re-writing it.  So, I sat there and quite evenly explained to the class that the book I had initially brought in would not do because, as the statistics prove, listening to me will only make you dumber.  I asked the next person to start talking.  That didn't go over all that well but, with Montreal and Boston playing I really didn't care.  4 hours later...that's right people 4 HOURS later, our class finally broke.  I took a nap and the prof wasn't all that impressed.  I wasn't all that impressed with the course so, I guess it evens out.  The kicker was that there is not even a course evaluation at the end of it.  This is the mandatory grad class and they request absolutely NO imput from students to make it better.  Fascinating little place I live in non?  Well, I'll ask my prof tomorrow why there wasn't any class evaluation forms like every other class in the world.  I sent an e-mail asking my prof if I had dramatically missed something so fundamental to the book that I should be booted out of grad studies for?  Really?  Should I be even going to university if I can't even improve on stuff that I had already read 3 or 4 times?  I'm depressed.  On a slightly lighter note I got my Lochead papers back and she gave me 14.5/15 for my reading journal and participation and 42/50 for my research paper.  So, I've figured out some things about my course work in grad studies:  89 from Cooper 87 from Jaworsky 85 from Lochead --- from Moul  So far, I am pulling an 87% average - GREAT!!  Now, I always assume the worst when it comes to Moul.  I am thinking that if he gives me a 75% (lowest I think i could get in that course) I am still going to get an 83 or 84% overall in coursework for my MA.  I think that is okay - just opens up the gates a little for PhD work if I entertain the thought.  I hate school though.  And girls are still the devil.  Gordon Lightfoot is on.

      Easter was a blurr of services, chocolate, turkey, maple syrup and manual labour.  I got a ride with my Aunt Jeannine and we took the back roads all the way to Barrie and then back onto the major 400 and then 11.  It was nice to go home and see Mom and Dad and Kate and Papere and the farms.  It was cold and windy but, it was April.  I shouldn't complain that much.  I worked on Papere's farm quite a bit since Jeannine and Michel want to get it open for the summer.  I helped moved the piano and bureaus and tables.  I hanged some portraits of ancestors on a new wall and tried to hold them straight.  I came back with Jeannine on Sunday and we took the same route past Orangeville then Arthur then Elmira etc...    Monday was sheer work and back pain.  I got up uber early to print off Woolstencroft's request of my thesis work thus far and then proceeded to do about 13 hours of marking for Boychuk.  That Woolstencroft didn't even show up on Monday to take my paper!  That bastard!  I worked like a dog for Boychuk when really he hasn't marked a single thing all term.  Lazy bastard.  Today is Tuesday and I have to get on with my last night class ever!!  We are having it at the Grad House and we are suppose to talk about our best peice of social science ever.  I'll bring something silly in.  So, another long day.  The funny thing is that I don't think that I will do all that much either.  I'll sit here and watch Family Guy and then surf the net.  I think that is all I am capable of at the moment.

      Ah, frosh are really terrible, terrible people.  Women Frosh are even worse!  See, this all fits into my grande law.  Case in point, I was having office hours yesterday and a whole whack of students came by to either a) complain about their paper marks or b) ask about the final exam.  I was happy to be vague on both.  This one girl came by and I initially gave her a 'generous' 77 on her paper.  She really tries in class and has some ideas but, the format was all wrong and there were loads of mistakes and she didn't back up any ideas with sources.  Anyway, she sent a shirty e-mail saying that she felt disappointed with the mark I awarded her and wanted me to review the sucker.  Oh, that got under my skin...did she not see the marking scheme??? Did she not know I was giving her a break??  Apparently, she wanted to go the hard way.  So, i did review it again and, on a second reading, those small errors really got under my skin and I awarded her a 69.  She came by yesterday and I went through the paper - category by category as the marking scheme dictates and told her why I gave her a lower grade in the ones I did lower it by and finally gave her paper back with a 69.    I informed her that the mark has been already sent to the Prof.  She was going to cry I knew it!  She completely devestated by it.  I really didn't feel all that bad for her.  I can see how she 'thought' handing it in a second time would get her a better mark.  She now knows that handing in a second time - without any changes or reasons why she said what she said - will only get her in more trouble.  I casually warned her about improper citation styles and mentioned the University's Plagarism Policy.  So, I set myself up by 'still' being the good guy by saying,   "You think I was hard the second time around? I could have really been a hard ass and cited you for technically violating the Plagarism Policy by not fully citing your sources each time and I could have given you a zero on the whole freakin' course!"  She was in shock and a natural inclination to hate my guts.  I really don't give a shit if some dumb ass Frosh didn't like the mark they got on a paper.  It really wasn't a great paper.  Stop handing in crap and you'll stop getting bad marks.  Shut up about it when a TA gets soft and is generous.  The average in the papers overall was 70 by the way.  She was complaining about having a 77.  Dim.  Really, really dim.  Well, it is Easter.  I'm going home for the weekend with my Aunt and Uncle and I'll be back on Monday.  It will be nice to have some home cooking and see the farm again.  Strange, I enjoy going home more and more as I get older.  The place will always have a soft spot in my heart.

      I have finished with academic work for this term - possibly my entire life.  I handed in my papers and readings journals and anything else of material value on Friday.  The only thing left is my thesis and that is not going to be pretty.  My supervisor wants whatever I have accomplished on his desk Easter Monday.  Damn him!  Well, I got some stuff done so, it isn't that bad.  Last night was the Grad Conference banquet.  The food was great!  I didn't bring anyone since we all know by now - Women are the Devil.  But, I did hang out with some cool Mathies and Systems Design people.  I'm not a geek.  Chris and Allan are doing Artificial Intelligence at UW.  Ishmail, Insop and Wo are doing Systems Design Engineering and robotics with Real-time.  I met them earlier in the conference because I was a judge for Chris and I watched Ishmail and Insop's presentations.  It was intriguing to see all the ideas and work other people in other disciplines are doing.  The same kind of methodology and research design I use in the social sciences can be applied to the hard sciences over there.  I can see so well how some of these hard science projects will directly affect the social sciences and vice versa.  It was a very enriching experience to learn that there is more to this university than the little bubble I occupy

      Yesterday was the busiest day I've had in years - YEARS!!!  I got up early and put my suit on and headed for the Graduate Research Conference at the University of Waterloo.  Got registered for judging in the morning and presenting in the afternoon.  So, I listened to about 4 presentations on Information and Technology.  Some of the stuff was sooo cool!  It was all about 3d imaging, controlling things in 3d, artifical intelligence, Nortel Networks that work in real-time and wireless.    I was just a little unsettled when the AI person started talking about "slaves", "autonomous workers", "co-ordinator and team leader".  I asked him if there is any debate about using these rather human and political words when talking about AI.  He flately said no, these are just jargon terms and since AI workers don't have a culture we shouldn't use our cultural words in the same fashion with them.  Okay, "slave."  After that was lunch and pitas.  Sweet, sweet pitas - I might go back there for lunch today since it is free and nobody checks!  In the afternoon I presented with the Society and Culture people.  It went okay.  I was nervous and had to cough a little.  They asked questions about urban reserves and I answered those quite well.    After my presentation I had to leave a little early because of Woolstencroft.  He wanted to meet with people individually to talk about the papers he had to mark.  It sucked!  I told me I should use paper numbers and be less awkward in my sentence structure.  I found 3 places where he made marks on my paper.  He gave me a 77.  What the hell is going on?  I get docked down to a B+ for not including page numbers?  It was a 5 page paper!  Well, I can take comfort in knowing that other students got really hard marks too so, I am actually on the top end of the pile.  Bastard.  This is 3:30-4PM now.  I finally come into my office and start working on my urban reserves paper.  I have to get this done by Friday morning!  I toiled away and procrastinated with MSN and Rob.  I finally got it all done by 12AM.  I could finally leave my office and get some food.  I walked home and had a bagel.  I woke up early this morning because I realized I have to organize these Boychuk papers.  I got them photocopied and now organized by sessional groups for distribution in less than an hour.  It looks like I am on the ball so far!  Just though.  On top of all of this, I found out that the Privy Council job screened me out of a job.  Bastards.  I'm not really that upset about it.  I am actually a little thankful that I don't have to do co-op since that is another 8 months onto my programme and I have done the co-op thing for so long that I don't think I want to do that for awhile now.    Well, Boychuk's class awaits.  I must be off.

      Ahoy one and all!  This has been a terrific week for me.  I spent most of it up on the farms around North Bay, Ontario.  Friday was an unusually easy drive up to North Bay (considering it was the Friday of the Victoria Day long weekend).  Michel and I got in at a decent hour and had beer and wine with my Aunt and Parents.  Saturday we were up bright and early to go over to my Papere’s farmhouse to do some cedar shingling and some faucet and fascia on the new roof of the new porch...all new all the time with me.  Saturday night we had more cousins of mine (Dad’s side) over for dinner and we planned weddings for August in Chatham, drank beer and wine and ate ourselves silly.    Sunday was Church in the morning - I had forgotten how good a preacher my Dad can be.  We went over to Papere’s for lunch and then did some light cleaning and some more fascia and faucet.  Monday was no respite, up in the morning, get my work clothes on and head over to Papere’s for more work.  Monday was different - because of the rain and the cold we stayed inside and installed new cabinets and took down old ones.  Crowbars, hammers, industrial screws and all we part of the action.    Tuesday was the same routine, this time, Michel left early in the morning so he could get to Toronto for work that morning.  We continued cleaning but this time we tackled the garage.  It was just my Aunt Jeannine and I this time.  We bagged all the junk and separated the metal for scrap.  We cleaned all morning but then we had to break off because we wanted to go to the cheap movies.  My sister and I went to see Shrek 2 and my Parents and Jeannine went to see Troy.  I already told you about Troy and they had the same reaction.  Shrek on the other hand is AWESOME!  So funny, so well done!  I would buy it and pay full price at the theatre if I had to.  Before the movie we went to a new restaurant in North Bay - the Purple Pig.  They have some really good ribs but, their chicken wings are the best!  A bit pricey for a sticky finger place but, a good treat since we have been working so hard.  Wednesday I did kindling.  Their is a massive pile of rejected barn board from the torn down porch that has been replaced.  My Aunt wanted me to clean the boards (take out all the nails) and chop them up into kindling so she can start fires in the morning.  That took the whole day!  While I was doing that my Mom and Jeannine were in the garage putting all those bags of junk into the truck and bringing it to the landfill site.  In the evening, I brought the tractor around and the wagon and loaded the scrap metal on it and drove it to the recycling centre up the road.  It was evening and the sun was setting over the fields.  I drove in first gear on the side of the road in a bright orange tractor and wagon and looked over the sunset and it was moving.  I could see to Quebec over the Laurentian Mountains and the breeze had died down and I could hear the swallows over the tractor engine.  It felt so much like home.  Thursday I got up early and packed my stuff and got a ride back with my Aunt to Toronto.  She had a meeting she couldn’t skip out on Friday morning so, I thought a free ride is good.  We got in at a good time and I got to Waterloo in time for some grocery shopping and a good sleep.  I woke up late today and just got into campus around noon.  I feel good about the work I did and I even got some work done on my thesis in the evenings.  I’m going to paste what I wrote down then into my working copy and see where I am by the end of the day.  There, that is my adventure!

      I'm going home for a week.  I'm getting a ride with my uncle Michel in Toronto after he gets off work.  We will fight traffic and trailer hitches all the way to Barrie but, I think after that things will be good.  I already e-mailed my Mom and my parents already made plans for Friday night.  They are going to a house party in North Bay but, they said they would leave a car at my Aunt and Uncle's so I can drive myself home.  They also informed me that the week of the 13th to the 20th they are taking my sister on a whirlwind tour of Ontario.  Two days in London to see Derek and get ready for the wedding in August; two days in Sudbury for shopping and casino; two days in Ottawa for a concert.  I don't get that.  See you in a week or so.

      I feel so lucky today.  I woke up late and I managed to have breakfast, make lunch and get down to campus before the rain and thunderstorms begin.  On the more whimsical side of life I had two interesting e-mails yesterday.  Marianne e-mailed me last night out of the blue.  Just random stuff about working this summer and going back to school this autumn.  Odd.  Then I got this e-mail from Celeste.  She is a tall Jewish redhead I met in Ottawa like 2 years ago while working there.  She was with Industry Canada; I was with Indian Affairs - kismet.  Yes, well, she just e-mailed me - random again!  She went on how Ottawa is lovely in the summer and how she has a full time job with IC.  Even more odd considering I haven't talked to the girl in over 2 years.  When it rains it pours - and they are calling for thunderstorms today :p  I'm going to have to get my holy water out.    I think that trip to Hamilton did me some good.  I did work yesterday and I was doing work today - in the AM.  That's right! I'm working before noon.  I'm on fire!!  I am also trying to get some work done because I might go home for the long weekend and stay for like a week.  My aunt is taking some vacation time and she wants to do some serious work at the farm and asked me to help her with flooring.    I'm not doing anything special - why not?

      Hamilton was good this weekend.  Rob, Tom and I (not Matthew!) went out to a few places and spent some time with the board games.  Rob's house is great! The only exception are the ants.  But, Mr. Arsenic will soon take care of that :P  I was thinking on the way back from Hamilton how much I want out of this lifestyle.  The constantly eating Kraft Dinner; the sharing my home with strangers; the lack of anything of material value.   I don't know if I can do another 4 years of that kind of stuff.  Maybe getting a job after this MA is the best thing.  I'd like to grow up.  Speaking about growing up - Troy was an okay movie.  The character development was none existent; the love saga was muted between Helen and Paris and the acting was a little forced if not completely transparent - but the fight scenes!!!  Anyway, the made Paris look like a pussy.  He fled from honour and valour in his big fight scene.  He coward away with an arrow to Achilles.  He really sucked I think.  Okay. back in Waterloo and the sun is shinning and I should do groceries sometime today.

      My bike is working wonderfully.  It is working so well that I can get to the office in a fraction of the time I used to take up so that now, I can procrastinate even more here.  This is starting to get on my nerves.  I haven't been motivated to push on with the rough almost all this week.  I just sit here and play solitaire; surf the net; download MP3s and kill time.  I need some motivation or a break.  This weekend Tom, Rob and I are getting together in Hamilton.  It is a housewarming party for Rob so, it should be good.  Maybe that will be the push I need to get back into the academic groove of things.  Maybe I need to go home for a bit.  Take some time off and go home and work on the farm and get away from the same routine all the time.  I think that will do me good.  Anyway, more stuff to do!

      2:05pm: I have my bike.  My old, old one from highschool.  My cousins in Guelph wanted it a few years ago and since I wasn't at home anymore I thought 'why not?'  This summer I needed and they brought it to Waterloo this afternoon.  They have their own bikes now and they haven't used it in a year so, it is okay.  I might go biking now and working out this summer.  I haven't worked out all year and I need it.  Yarrr...I'm unattractive.

      So, this is how Global Warming works.  It isn't so much a gradual heating of the earth as more just screwing around with the weather more and more.  Like spring for example.  You would think that it would be a mild and gradual heating of the earth and the snow would gradually melt away for a couple of months and stuff.  Oh no....it is cold, cold, cold...then SUMMER!!!  With the humidity today it is like 34C around here.  Last week it was 4C.  I'm not complaining that much - until the earth becomes like Mars - then I'll complain.  Speaking of spring, St. Paul's College at UW as finished their Grad Complex already - ALREADY!  They must have had some big time money to put that up that quickly.  It will be 80 apartments for grad students and 30 hotel style rooms for visiting faculty and doc fellows and VIPs to the university to crash at.  A rompus room in the basement for the little kids if the grads or faculty have little ones.  The entire roof will be a patio.  I want to go in there but, news through the grapevine is that to share a 2 bedroom apartment will start at 700/months per person.  I ain't doing that without substantial research money to pay for it.

      Oh my! Blogger has changed the look of its site!  I like!  Everything is changing all the time now - the leaves are sprouting; I downloaded the newest version of Netscape; the computer people came by and said I can't use LimeWire to download songs; and downloaded the latest version of MSN Messenger - everything is changing.  Oh! I found more evidence of why women are the devil.  Today is one of the few days this spring where it is pleasant.  No rain in the forecast AND sunny - very rare combination this spring.  I was walking to campus this morning and a girl was walking from the car park wearing a hugging GAP style white sleevless shirt and a mini skirt and high, spaghetti string heels -  I almost laughed!  I laughed at her legs - they were shapely and quite nice but, white as a ghost!  Somebody has been all wrapped up this winter and is sooooooo anxious to show off her legs to the world she can't wait to get them burned and get skin cancer!  Good for the shallow girls.  I'm thinking of going to Toronto for a day trip soon  - watch a Blue Jays game or something.  Just an idle thought from an idle man.

      Saturday afternoons on campus are boring.  I don't think you needed me to tell you that but, that is what is on my mind at the moment.  I have discovered a few things about myself on this rainy and cold May Saturday: first, I am found of Crown Royal.  I went to the LCBO and I must say, CR is the best Rye Canada has made.  It is fresh and goes down easy.  Second, I am an old man trapped in a young man's body.  I like listening to the CBC on the weekends.  I enjoy Definitely Not the Opera and I actually walk in the rain and cold to the office to get the reception for it.  Third, I hate people.  I can't stand talking to them let alone waiting in queue with them.  I feel an urge to run and I have to hold that back if I want my Frosted Flakes or whiskey.  Fourth, I am a procrastinator extrodinaire.  I should be doing work on my thesis today but, since I finished the rough of Chapter 8, I just can't get over it and get on with revising it and adding more rough stats and fodder.  That is new with me.  I'm very lonely at the moment.  Marianne just had a random chat with me - said three words and never replied back - just to rattle me I think.  Just to get under my skin a little and screw up the delicate healing that is my heart.  No healing today unless it involves Crown Royal.  Sweet, sweet liquor.

      Last night was the end of Friends.  It was actually a good night for me.  I waited out the rain to walk back home and the air was thick with spring.  The flowers were in bloom, the grass was green, everything was oozing of life in the warm, wet night.  In Canada, they showed the first hour episode which is just a recap of the whole show at 7.  Then they showed Survivor at 8 which i promptly turned off and then did dinner.  I finished dinner just in time for the real final episode at 9.  Wow, that was a - ugh - great twist at the end there.  There was nothing to it!  I'm glad the show is over; if that was the best they could come up with then I don't want to know what an average show was like.  Anyway, I watched Jon Stewart last night and I laughed a good laugh before going to bed.  I've found going to bed laughing is indeed the best way to end a day.  This weekend I don't know what I will be doing.  I really should buy a bicycle and get out some more.  I kind of like walking though - I am fickle and indifferent to the punishment on my body.  I don't want to do any work today.  I might not - who knows?  I'm just unpredictable that way.

      It is Sunday at noon.  I came through the rain and cold to listen to Stuart McLean and the Vynl Cafe.  I miss hearing him!  I'm such an old man and I don't care.  I should be having dinner with Yaacov tonight - should is the operative word.  With the rain and cold I am not tempted to walk down to uptown Waterloo just yet.  By dinner time it might change a little.  Stuart is in Grand Bend Ontario on the shores of Lake Huron.  I've never been to Grand Bend - never to Lake Huron I believe.  I think once I was in Midland which is very close but not quite on Huron.  I enjoy Sunday afternoons - even this one.  Nobody was home last night and it felt good to have the apartment to myself on a Sunday morning.  I played my MP3s loud and had a leisurely shower and shave.  I cooked a hot breakfast instead of sneaking around with a bowl of cereal and homo milk.  I miss my privacy.

      This is me not writing my thesis......  It is Saturday and I woke up late.  I really don't mind.  I still have a running nose and I want it to end!  Grrr..it was raining when I got up and there is no more food in the house.  I decided to get ready to go to the dollar store (no real groceries for me!)  When I stepped outside, the rain stopped and it was gorgeous!  No sun but, everything oozed of springtime.  The flowers were blooming, the lawns were wet and green and everything was warm and humid and you could smell the lilacs from all directions.  I walked to the dollar store and I waited in line for 15 minutes to pay for my Cherry Coke, batteries and Mr. Big.  I've been meaning to get batteries for a good week and a half now.  Anyway, these children (10 years old methinks) never had enough change for their junk food and had to put stuff back...grrr..get some money!  Anyway, walked to campus and I am suppose to have dinner with Yaacov tonight.  I e-mailed to ask if there is anything he wants but no answer yet.  I don't have his phone number so, that is it.  I'm listening to Radio 2 at the moment. I can't find Radio 1.  They are doing the best and weirdess all time mix ups in singing.  Pavaroti and Bryan Adams are the weirdess.  Tony Bennett and k.d. Lang is actually one of the best.  I walked home last night and started looking through my old diary entries - really hold ones.  From 2001 and 2000.    How silly I was!  How sensitive I was!  How in love I was!  It was interesting going through all that again.  I should have had some rye with me but, alas, none.  I'll try AM radio this afternoon and check out Christians or the Detroit-Calgary game.  Good combination methinks.

      Liberals - 135 Conservatives - 96 Bloc - 54 NDP - 22  I make no secret of it, I was hoping for a Tory Minority being propped up by the Bloc.  I got a Liberal Minority (possibly coalition) with the NDP.  I have no idea what this new parliment is going to do for another year or two.  I've already heard that NDP might want cabinet posts.  This means that the Liberals are actually going to have to deliver on the promises they made during the campaign when it comes to social issues.  This is a big spectrum of stuff:  1. strenghten the gun registry (does this mean putting MORE money into it?) 2. more money for health care (does this mean the feds and provs will overlap more and double spend more?) 3. endorse same-sex marriage (does this mean retracting the question from the Supreme Court and actuallying doing your job as a parlimentarian and actually pass legislation?) 4. no capital punishment (was this ever really going to happen anyway?) 5. abortion is legal (does this mean it was illegal and legislation has to be passed or just status quo?) 6. pot delegalised (does this mean just doing what they were going to do anyway?) 7. electoral reform (liberals will NEVER do this even if they get in bed with the NDP) 8. curb spending on the military (how much more on curbing? like stop clothing them?) 9. give money to Chester Nova Scotia (Martin promised it in desparation yesterday) 10. give money to Saskatoon Saskatchewan (Goodale already wants more Agriculture burueacracy there) 11. give money to Fredericton, New Brunswhick (for highways and pot-holes which is a prov thing) 12. give money to Toronto for a variety of reasons and projects (waterfront, hot house, stadium etc..) 13. give money to Vancouver, British Columbia (drugs, olympics, more drugs etc..) 14. give money to Montreal, Quebec (for being liberal..something I don't know!) 15. give money to Chicotomey, Quebec (tax centre, golf courses, employ people) 16. give money to Outremont, Quebec (humm...lawn maintenance, more protection etc..) 17. nationalise the railway (which was a conservative idea to begin with - ironic bonus points)  Well, it is a minority government - hopefully nothing will get done.  And it is a sad day when you are hoping your government will get nothing done.

      This has been a krazy, krazy weekend.  So much to say!   1. Thursday June 24 : Toronto benefit party for Descant Magazine and Oxford Press.  Wonderful home-made sausages*(comment for this later), white and red wines, great people, great Scottish music.  They raised over 2300 bucks in one night.   2. Friday June 25 : Michael Moore just gets better and better.  His latest film is the best movie he has created.  It is more polished and slick than Bowling for Columbine.  9/11 is powerful and it isn't about Moore at all.  Makes you think about Bush but, you have to be careful not to be dooped like you have been with Bush.  No mention of the UN, no mention of other US operations at the time etc...  Still, standing ovation for it and it was worth it!   3. Saturday June 26 : In-between all this I've been drinking and staying with Alex and Colin in Toronto.  Every morning we woke up around 8AM and watched Wimbeldon and drank our "orange Juice" of the red or white variety :p  We cut that short today because I got on the GoTrain and went to Oakville and then Burlington to see the Royal Botanical Gardens.  The Roses were in bloom, the sun was shining - hooray for all.  I ate Krispy Kremes and I am going to demand that from my Aunt when I go back to Toronto on Wednesday this week.  I saw Emma's in Burlington (quintessential Canadian lakeshore patio bar).  And then the spontaneous Mardi Gras party in Hess Village.  I had a theory - a krazy one but, it really works I think.  This Mardi Gras (during Pentecost which is weird) I believe is in response to Gay Pride in Toronto - the Hamilton faut Gras is a Hetero Pride celebration.  Think about it:  Happened the same day as Gay Pride began in Toronto; nobody was cross dressing in Hess (as far as I could see); there was the Ontario Bikini Challenge competition (how hetero can you get!) and the "contestants" were right out of Playboy - likes "sausages and men who like working with their hands".  Sneaky people.   4. Sunday June 27 : I finally made my way back to Waterloo.  I arrived at the office at 3:30pm and discovered that my bike has another flat tire!  I replaced it just before going on this vacation - grrrrr  I walked home and didn't do anything except call home and then made arrangements to go to North Bay on Wednesday.

      Ahoy,  Let my weekend begin!  It will start with a haircut within minutes!  Then, off to Toronto to visit Alex and Colin.  At some point in time I'll be in Hamilton to check out the Royal Botanical Gardens and then visit Rob in the evening.  My plan is to be back in Waterloo on Sunday at some point.  Let the games begin!

      New look to my blog!  I played around with the colours and fonts and brought back Halo Scan for comments.  I have started the last chapter of the body of my thesis today.  I have three sentences of the introduction done and I am wiped.  The upside is that I am going to Toronto this weekend and I am going to try my best to see Fahrenheit 9/11.    I have a Graduate Student Association meeting tonight and I am bringing up three things to council:  1. Champions Series matches in Toronto this July.  With the great success of Euro2004 at the Grad House would it be possible for us to buy a block of tickets for July 30 or 31?  Friday's game is Liverpool vs. FC Porto and Saturday's is Roma vs. Celtic.  2. Last night on the local newscast they showed a Waterloo City Council meeting were a local councilor put forward his own vision of a student village in the city for UW and WLU students.  What the hell is this?  Is this related to Edey and FEDs taskforce report that will be tabled to City Council in August?  Was this some kind of trial balloon?  What the hell is going on?  3. Senate approved a Nanotechnology degree programme at the undergraduate level last week - is there a grad programme in the works?  The way I read is that you can major in Nanotechnology OR you can get a degree in Nanotechnology.  I was confused by the press release and would like some clarification and secondly, how will this effect grad and faculty research already underway?  Were grads or faculty consulted on this?  The University is trying to pull some fast ones over the summer.  I really don't care all that much;  I would just like it to be public and have some consultation with the GSA.

      Monday, manic Monday.  The weekend was great.  The BBQ at Tom's was excellent.  Chris, Kevin, Kevin and Simon were there.  It was unabashed nerd talk and we reveled in it all!  Burgers, hot dogs and PMJs were overflowing.  I biked back from Tom's and it took less than 20 minutes - good to note.    Sunday I came back to campus in the morning and finished the chapter I was working on this week and got it done.  I am on the last chapter of body of my thesis now - just the rough though so, I'll be revisiting this soon.  I also phoned home three times on Sunday trying to wish my Dad a happy Father's Day.  They didn't phone back until 11:30PM - drunk.  It is so special to hear my parents talk drunk-talk.  Apparently they were at the Church and at my Aunt and Uncle's place all day.  They had lunch at my Aunt and Uncle's and then went back to the church for a Father's Day dinner and then live music (country and fiddling etc...)  My Dad is recuperating today with Wimbeldon.  I'm recuperating from ugh..work with ugh..more work!  It is National Aboriginal Day so, I thought I would open up the National Post and see what they are doing - nothing.  I've checked CBC online and - nothing.  The Toronto Star - nothing.  Oh well, I guess those people don't exist I guess - unless you count the latest  urlLink Auditor General report about Nunavut .  Well, I will work on the last chapter of the body today - and then the conclusion after that.  I have a GSA meeting this week and I am going to Toronto for the weekend so, I better get going.  Oh, England is playing today at 2:30pm in  urlLink Euro2004  action.  My hope, is that England will defeat Croatia today and then have to meet France.  France will beat them AGAIN in injury time.  That would be sweet!

      Thursday and I am breezing through the chapter on my thesis - a little too easy I think.  I'm paranoid and I will have to redo this chapter.  Just going too well.  I'm going to watch the English/Swiss game today.  I was going to watch it at noon but, The Grad House doesn't get Fox World so, i can't watch it live and TSN is showing the game at 3pm - after it is all over.  I just don't get it.  Is this some kind of Canadian content rules thing with the CRTC?  Or, is this how the contract goes down for secondary broadcasts?  You can only broadcast after the initial contract holders have done the live thing?  Anyway, it kind of sucks because for a few hours I have to shut out the world and not watch the score  - diffcult let me tell you.  I'm not that even involved in football.  I just want to see what England does.  They are always so hyped - I wonder if that is because they are the Anglophones in the tournament and so the Anglo-World is cheering for them or if they are really that good?  I think it is more of the first than second.  We'll see if they have character.  I secretly want the English to win because then they might meet France again and LOSE!! Ha ha ha ha! That would sweet for those English pigs with no brain.

      So, I am a nerd and a political scientist - a terrible, terrible combination when elections are on.  Last night was the English debates and here is where I stand on: who did what, impressions I was left with AND what I think the leaders should have said.  Paul Martin - The Liberals and Martin HAD to win this debate.  He had to come out aggressive against Harper and paint him as the fascist baby killing, gun lovin' redneck like in their ads.  He didn't do that.  As such, Martin lost this debate.  He tried his best to talk about the Not Withstanding Clause (which, I think, if you are not a lawyer or a political scientists, the vast majority of the population tuned out to watch Horatio Hornblower).  He then directed it to the more simpler shots at abortion and same-sex marriage which Layton loved.  Overall, Paul Martin was on the ropes most of the night from all the opponents.  He got flustered, looked arrogant when Layton pointed that out and didn't seem confident and wanted to get the HELL out of there.  Jack Layton - What does a third party have to lose?  Although he was marginalized by the title fight of Martin vs Harper, he had some good moments.  I LOVE the shot he had of calling Martin arrogant right from his opening statements when Martin referred to only two parties to choose from - good job Layton for sticking up for yourself.  Now, I think he could have exploited it some more by going after it.  Say, "Arrogance is in your veins Martin.  Is this the same arrogance that man handles riding associations that don't cowtow to your whims?  Is this the arrogance that created a fiscal imbalance for the provinces?  Is this the arrogance that wants to see less and less power taken away from the social service delivering provinces and more into Liberal slush funds?"  Just my opinion.  Gilles Duceppe - I'm not a separatist but man, I think he came out as the leader from the debate.  Please, don't hang me.  I'm just going by what I saw.  He was on message about the priority of Quebec.  He really got into Martin about scandal and GM and fiscal imbalance.  He is an intelligent, passionate and articulate.  Stephen Harper - The goal for the Conservatives was not to be boxed into any social issues and not to be made out to be Satan.  I think Harper accomplished that - win for him.  He was cool, calm and more aggressive at the same time against Martin.  Martin tried more against Harper in the English debates than in the French and he still couldn't nail him.  Although, sometimes Harper was a little too evasive and unfortunately smart of the debate.  There was one instant where they were talking about health care and Harper rightly pointed out to Mr. Layton that health management is run by the provinces and Ottawa can't just control hospitals.  Layton just went on with socialist slogans about universal health care.  Harper at least grasps the reality of the situation but, best not let the voters know that.    So, my thinking is in order of "winning"  1. Duceppe 2. Harper 3. Martin 4. Layton

      So, I watched the French-Language debate last night on Radio-Canada.  This is my opinion of what went down:  Before we begin, I have to say that the expectations from the (largely) Quebec audience and the goals of the individual leaders are very different.  Goals for the leaders I think:  Martin - You must win.  You have to slam into Duceppe and make him look like an amateur or a fool. Duceppe - Keep your mouth shut.  The Liberals are in a free fall and all you can do is just bring up the sponsorship scandal, corruption, and MAYBE incompetence and you're golden. Layton - Appeal to the Quebec social system.  Kiss ass and tell them you want to make the Quebec strong social system work even better.  Bring up Kyoto and all those good things.   Harper - Speak French.  Nobody knows you dans la belle province.  Just stay relaxed and on message.  Expectations from the audience I think:  Martin - fess up to your mistakes and make me feel confident about Liberal governance. Duceppe - nail and rattle Martin.  Make him feel shame. Everybody else - Ils parlent francais??  So, this is how I think it went down.  Duceppe was the winner.  This shouldn't be a big surprise.  He is the francophone in the room and his language skills were superb.  But, what really made him the winner was that he danced around and moved the topic in mid-sentence - sly and brilliant.  For example, he started off with attacking Liberal governance and sponsorship and then tied it to Conservative abortion rules and same-sex marriage.  The others didn't know what to do first. Clever man.  Clever like a renard.  Martin didn't lose the debate but, he didn't win it either - that is the fatal flaw.  Martin is not going to lose any support because of his performance in that debate but, he isn't going to gain either.  And when you are going to lose 40 some seats to your opponent in Quebec - maintaining is not good enough.  Harper is not a demon.  He was cool, calme, surprisingly good French considering he picked it up from study in the past 2 years only.  I was impressed BUT, I had very low, low expectations for him (like most Quebekers) "Wow! Harper parle francais?!" Oui.  He made his point and laid the ground work for the next election.  Layton is in the same boat as Harper.  He spoke well for being an anglophone (better than what I ever could have done in front of national TV and flood lights and fighting people).  And laid the groundwork for sucking up to Quebec next time around.  This was a freebie for Layton considering he knew Quebec was not interested in him and just kind of introduced himself as a French-speaking politician that has similar policies to Quebec's social system.  The French debate was really up to Martin and Duceppe and Duceppe won - that simple.  The battle is lost but the war goes on - for English debates are tonight.    My predictions:  Martin will come out very, very aggressively against Harper on social issues and fiscal incompetence.  He'll try and paint Harper as either a rookie and can't count and/or a socially conservative wacko that will make us into Republican America.  Harper will stay cool and calm and lobe some stuff to Martin about sponsorship, tying him to McGuinty and corruption and incompetence.  He'll take the role of the statesman and play it safe and if there is an opening he'll go for it but, won't push it.  The "trap" defence of Harper will win it for him.  Layton will be Layton - I have no idea what will come out of his mouth.

      My middle-class student weekend is coming to a close.  It was great.  ZDane-o came over to Waterloo and we played golf on Saturday.  We went to Rockway Golf Course in Kitchener and it is a great course for a pretty good green fee.  We were paired up with another couple of young guys and it was a good afternoon and evening.  After golf we went back to my place and made dinner and then sat on the back porch with some Keith's and talked shop.  Around 11:30pm we decided to go to Molly's for a couple of pitchers - Keith's again.  We closed the place down and then walked back to my place.  He had to work today so he left pretty early.  I washed the dishes and checked e-mail this morning and then did groceries.  I am now back on campus thinking about doing some more work on the thesis and enjoying the A/C.    My parents were in London this weekend.  They were invited to go to a stag party for one of my cousins who is getting married in August.  I wasn't invited intially so I passed on that and went golfing.  I don't think my parents will come and visit.  They are travelling with more family and I think they will try and make it back to North Bay in one day.  That is all with me.

      Okay, for the majority of the day the internet was out for the laptop network here in my abode.  So, I actually had to do some work.  I was surprised that with no distractions I still did very little around here.  Well, perhaps tomorrow or on the weekend.

      Calgary has lost the Cup.  I have finished chapter 4 and I haven't done anything today.  It is 32C out and humid.  I have to proctor an exam tonight.  I like writing in short, choppy sentences.  Makes me feel like an American Presidential speech-writer or something.  It is Tuesday and I am already looking forward to the weekend.  I'm a grad student that lacks any concept of time or dates and I am looking forward to the weekend.  I want to go golfing and drink beer.  I want to be a bachelor of middle-class means.  Where is my moderately priced domestic premium beer and public golf course green fee?  I feel like stylin' the Canadian way.

      I watched some TV yesterday and this morning.  The 60th Anniversary of D-Day took place on Sunday.  I watched some of it on TV.  It was a beautiful day in Normandy.  It wasn't 60 years ago.  Clarkson, Martin, McCallum and the Queen were there.  I think that is especially nice that the Queen came and paid tribute to the Canadians.  I do believe the media forgets about Canada's contribution to that battle and to the whole War sometimes.  At the time, I don't think we were in the same category as Poland or Australia.  We were a big player - had our own beach and could handle it.  Those men pushed furthest in-land on that day out of all of the Allied Forces.  Funny, I didn't hear all that much from the Americans.  I read some stuff on BBC and CBC and they covered the British and Canadian stories (both of them!).  But, I have not heard from the Americans.  I wonder why that is.  Have they moved on so much that to remember something that ancient is passe for them?  Are they pre-occupied with Reagan's death and Iraq that they don't have time to pay tribute to the fighters of freedom?  The front page of the National Post is a massive picture of RR saluting.  The side title of the article is "Gallant Leader Mourned".  On top there is a little shot of "Stanley Cup Do or Die" in reference to Calgary."  Some of the stupid headlines that shouldn't be headlines on the front. "Swedish woman stressed out by neighbours' lovemaking"; "Anglican archbishops urge Canada's expulsion".  It is funny to point out that ALL of these news events happened on Friday or Saturday.  None of this happened on Sunday.  The only thing that happened the day before this newspaper was issued was the D-Day ceremonies.  And that didn't get to the front page but Swedish woman and lovemaking did.  I wish the National Post would get over the corporate turf wars and report on something CTV has been doing for all weekend.  Corporate take-over of the news sucks.

      I procrastinate quit a bit while I'm at work.  Today is no exception.  I have a large National Geographic map in my office that looks at the American Northern Mid-West states.  I picked it up last year in Ottawa.  I picked it up for 50 cents because I thought it would come in handy looking at the American reservations and Air Force Bases.  I also found some lovely names to little towns down there.  Places that are just fascinated with Butte: Mud Butte, SD; Slim Buttes, SD; Bear Butte, SD; White Butte, ND; Zap, ND; Winner, SD; Faith, SD; Liberal KS; Republic  Independence KS, Mexico MS, Toronto SD, Ottawa KS, Flasher ND, Ransom KS, Virginia MN, and Liberty MS.  These are just some of the places I know I know.   These are just some of the places I know.

      It is Friday!  To many people that means something - to a grad student writing his thesis - just means one less day you will never be able to relive in this otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory that is life.  Last night was a momentary blip though.  After work some friends of mine and I went to see Super Size Me at the Princess.  That movie was fantastic!  I don't know if it was worth 9bucks for a guy to tell me what I already knew but, the message was still good to hear again - like going to Church or something.  What was really shocking was the kind of damage the fast food did to him.  His liver had the exact same damage and symptoms as an alcoholic going on a drinking binge.  So, eating fast food or going on a drinking binge will have the same effects.  I don't think I'm doing fast food for a long time.  I don't do it all that much anyway (only when friends are over or I travel).    After the movie (which was packed! standing room only) My friends and I went to the Huether to see Game 5 and the Flames take it in OT.  Good job Calgary.  I really don't care which team wins (there are Canucks on both!) But, for sentimental reasons I guess Calgary should have it.  The Canadian Team, the team with grit and with less talent and money than Tampa (not by much though).  They are both underdogs which makes it so hard to choose.  Well, I think ZDane-o is coming over today to play some golf.  His Dad is in Toronto and he said that he might go there instead - all up in the air so - who knows? I live life on the edge.  If not, I got sweet, sweet TVOntario to keep me occupied tonight.  I finished chapter 3 this morning.  I'll do chapter 4 this afternoon and evening a bit.

      Hummm...my Chinese exchange student has appeared! Grrrrrr.  I was about to leave the house and I was putting on my new velcro shoes at the bottom of the stairs and she just opened her door.  She then looked at me and closed the door again.  Chinese girls are jacked up.  No wonder I haven't seen her.  She has been avoiding us!  I kind of like it.  I wish she was even more uncomfortable then she would move out.  Well at least there is one more person to chip in on the gas bill.  Not that it is all that big - 65 bucks divided by 6 people.  Oh well.  I'm going to the Princess tonight with my PSCI colleagues and then on to the Huether for the end of the Calgary - Tampa hockey finals.  I think Calgary will take it.  It is one of those see-saw series.

      You know, I suspect that my Chinese exchange student has left the apartment.  I haven't smelled her fish or seen her gunk up the washroom since I got back from my mini-vacation.  Humm...I love it! - one more to go!!  In other news, I think ZDane-O and I are getting together this weekend for golf - if the rain holds out.  Now, back to work...I just realized that it is June - JUNE! I have to get my stuff together if I want to finish this thesis thing this year.  Herb out!

      Toronto is a great city.  So affluent, so cosmopolitan.  I've been taking walks in the afternoons to get away from thesis work while I cat-sit here in Toronto.  I've walked by the lakeshore and read the newspaper in the park; today I will be going on King to check out the shops and perhaps downtown to have a coffee or iced tea and see if I can buy some music or books.    I think I'll try and check out some touristy this weekend - a show? Go to the AGO?  Walk around Yorkville or Cabbagetown?  The possibilities!

      The weekend was exhausting...so exhausting, i'm going on vacation again.  I spent the weekend in Hamilton - no spontaneous Mardi-Gras' - oh wait, ya, there was!!  These Mardi-Gras just follow me around!  After seeing Comedy of Errors, Emma's in Burlington was doing a Mardi-Gras night with the servers.  Speaking about Shakespeare, I think Comedy of Errors is the root of the classic sit-com, slapstick film method of mistaken identity.  Classic stuff.  Oh, and the source of "she's so fat..." jokes.  Elizabeathan trash talk was also pretty cool too.  Luckily, there was no trash talk or Mardi-Gras' OR mistaken identities in Hess Village Saturday night.  There was a mistaken identity - I hope - the day before in Westdale.  But, I won't get into that.  This coming week I have to proctor an exam today in about an hour and then go back home to sleep and pack for Toronto.  I'll be in Toronto for a week and I am hoping to get lots of work done on my thesis - and maybe in the evening catch a show or something.  I was thinking of going to watch the Masters' Tennis Championship at the new York University Tennis Centre.  It is the men's so, I'm not that motivated to go - for the qualify of the game people!!  Oh, today is Ed Mirvish day in Toronto.  CBC is reporting that to honour Mr. Mirvish the Toronto Police Board is going to name a new Colt in the mounted police division "Mirvish".  I want a horse named after me - what would be an appropriate name for a horse to honour me?

      Oh, the weekend is almost here!  My landlords are putting down tile in the apartment so, this works out rather well.  I'm going to Hamilton and won't be back until Sunday.  Rob is without water so, it will be like living at home!  Hooray!  I'll try and get some work done on my thesis.  I have a little wait at Williams in Hamilton so I'll just whip out my iBook and start tapping away like the trained monkey that I am.  I'll also read my National Post at Williams and forego the usual morning ritual of reading the paper - it will be an afternoon thing for me.  So, things are set, good times all around!

      My production level has sharply decreased today.  People come in and I talk and then go to the Grad House for lunch.  I also had a meeting with a prof to talk about proctoring her exam next week.  I'm all excited about Hamilton this weekend.  So many possibilities, driving ranges, mini-putting, Hess village, spontaneous Christmas shows, jazz, theatre....all of it a good, good thing.  Because that is what I need - more vacation time.

      The pain in my chest is just a signal that I have to do more work on my thesis right?  Right???  This sucks.  I did nothing while up north on this thing and now I get back to the office and all the other people are almost done their MRPs (I'm doing a thesis so, I shouldn't feel too bad)  but, I feel like I'm being left behind.  Grrrr.  I'm lazy, nagging and uninspired.  The upside is that I had lunch with Tom yesterday and that was good.  The drywall is all done in my place and so no new interuptions with drilling and drywalling at least until August.  I want to see Control Room at the Princess Soon.  I'll get on that pronto.  I like that word - word-o-the-week.

      Another week up north.  So much work, so much painting, cleaning, trips to the hardware store, landfill site etc...  We (the family) got many projects accomplished.  We have the kitchen painted, the guest house painted, a new double door on the barn, cleaned the attic, cleaned the back porch, and cleaned the barn.  In all this we also planted some new lilac bushes and maple trees.  It was exhausting work and relentless.  Getting up at 7am and getting to the farmhouse by 8:30am and then working there until 6 or 7pm for a solid week.  I am glad to be back in Waterloo so I can relax and do my thesis.    The upside to all these travails is that on the train ride back to Toronto I ran into Alex and Colin also taking the train.  We sat together and talked and drank rye.  Hooray!  They were in the Bay to talk and get to know Colin's side of the family before the wedding in a couple of weeks.   I am going to Toronto to cat and housesit their place while they go to New Orleans for the wedding.  Okay, I have done nothing with my thesis all week.  I need to get on that pronto.

      Another whirlwind weekend!  Thursday:  Got into Toronto and then got picked up by my Aunt Jeannine at Yorkdale.  We drove back to her place, packed the Honda Civic and got to the Farm at a decent hour and had wine and beer until about 1am with my Mom and Dad.  I think it was Canada Day.  We drank in its honour :p  Friday:  Went to my grandparents' place and started taking out stuff from the attic.  Man, 80 years of pack-ratting has created a garbage situation.  So much stuff - some good but mostly bad.  Note: homemade jam from 1972 is NOT good.  Although, radios from the 20s are cool.  Just a taste of what we did on Friday.  Saturday:  Dump day.  The township of Bonfield where I live has a one day a month clean up policy where you can bring anything and as much as you want to the landfill site free of charge.  There rationale is better to get it dumped properly then for them to refuse to come to the landfill and just dump stuff in the backroads and forrest.  So, we collected my parents' cards, my cousins' cards, my grandparents' cards and their neighbours' cards and went to the landfil.  7 loads later we emptied what we had taken out of the attic.  Saturday night we went down to Lac Talon and saw my cousin Morgan's new cottage by the lake.  Gorgeous 2 storey place that will most likely be the retirement spot later on.  Such a good contrast to see something brand new from scratch compared to the stuff I am doing at the farmhouse.  Sunday:  Church and then back to Farmhouse for a lunch and then plant some lilacs and cedars before packing up the Honda and heading back to Toronto.  The traffic was TERRIBLE.  It slowed and stopped at Bracebridge on the 400.  Bracebridge is about 240km away from Toronto.  And it was pretty much stop and go from there to the 401.  We left at 2:30 and arrived at 9:00 - 6.5hr drive that usually takes less than 4hrs.  Monday:  Because of the insane traffic I slept over at my Aunt and Uncles and made my way to KW today via Greyhound.  Came back and finished my last chapter and now I'm working on the conclusion of my thesis.  I had lunch with Tom and now I am going to see Fahrenheit 911 tonight with him.  So much to do - I haven't been to my apartment in such a long time - I hope nothing has gone bad.  Oh well, I'll find out tonight.

      The weekend has been great!  It all started with an early rise on Saturday morning to catch the bus to Hamilton.  Rob and I, after a little chili experiment at Wendy's, headed to Newmarket for Chris' housewarming party.  Rob got Chris a Plantone; I got Chris 80 Classic Atari games.  Time will tell which one will be best.  Chris' place is wonderful.  A very clean and empty townhouse just off Yonge in Newmarket.  Very easy to get to from the 404 and the 400.  Close to Upper Canada Mall, LCBO, gas, etc...  I think he'll enjoy the place.  I did have an odd feeling walking around and seeing all the same old Gurney stuff but, you know that he is not the same old Gurney in some other ways.  He still plays games and watches things on DVD and all that but, he is a homeowner now with a car and mortgage and business trips.    Everybody is growing up except me - I'm holding out until the end!  Lots of people were there:  Kevin, Kevin, Kevin (nickname for Rob), Simon, Terry Lo, Dave Chang, Andrew Leung, Mike Cowley Sabrina (soon to be Cowley), and Cheryl.  Rob and I didn't stay the night.  We hightailed it back to Hamilton and walked for a coffee and then went back to his place and played games until the wee hours of the morning.  I'm now back in Waterloo and checking e-mail.  Apparently, my supervisor has replied to my e-mail and he is saying that I should remind him about me next week.  He has 5 MA projects to work on this month and there is a queue.  Hmmm...sounds good to me.  Mom e-mailed about bills and some Russians e-mailed about a new viagara drug.  I'll check all of them out in due course.

Now, in all fairness, I haven't been by the computer in cat like readiness waiting on her every word.  I've done work in between these long, long waits for a response but, still, the polite thing is to at least let the other person know you have to go.  Even go offline it might help.    I hate women!  I hate them sooooo much!!  Here I was minding my own business working with Statistical software in the computer lab and I get sand bagged by absolutely nothing!  Now I'm all flustered and hot and my mouth is dry.  I'm going to drink some water.

      It has begun!  I have printed off chapter 1 of my thesis.  I have to e-mail my supervisor and ask if he will read it.  He asked for my stuff in March and I handed in the preface and the outline and he hasn't responded.  Maybe this will tickle his fancy.  So, I did groceries today; I did laundry today; I did my thesis today; I want to go home but, I am tempted to start some stuff now.  I want to get some work done because this weekend I am going to Chris' methinks.  Much to talk about.  The rain, the Germans the landlords all of it just winding down.  I am going to have to go to the Registrar's and decide to stay full time and get OSAP or go full time and no OSAP.  I don't know what to do.  We'll see soon.  Very soon!

      So much has happened this week.  I have been in Toronto in case people reading this dont't know.  I had to come back to Waterloo tonight to proctor an exam.  I want to fail or at least refuse someone their exam at least once tonight.  ONCE!  On the lighter side, I was listening to the radio this morning in the apartment in Toronto packing my things and it was a Hamilton rock station.  And guess what folks - Hamilton is having ANOTHER FREAKIN' MARDI GRAS this weekend.  What is with Mardi Gras and that town??  So, I've been down by the lakeshore, to St.Lawrence Market, Queen St. King St. Kensington Market, Yorkville and most points in between.  I was out on Saturday and Sunday nights when the Football matches were being played in SkyDome.  It was hilarious to see the crowds of Liverpool and FC Porto fans swarm on King and Queen after the game.  Same thing when Roma beat Celtic the next day.  Carabana was also pretty good.  I walked by Dundas Square and there was some random (to me anyway) steel drum concerts.  The police presence was palpable for it all.  The parade I didn't go down to Lakeshore, i just leaned out of my picture window in the apartment and took some pics.  So, ChampionSeries-Carabana was a great combination.  I've also given directions to more people this week than any other time ever in Toronto.  And I don't even live there!  So, I'm back, my mom had her birthday yesterday and I accidentally phoned :p  Tonight, after the proctoring, I'll do a proper phone call.  On to proctoring!
