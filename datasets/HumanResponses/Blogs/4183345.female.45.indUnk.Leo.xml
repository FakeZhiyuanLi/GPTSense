      Devastating hurricanes, black cats, old horror movies and my birthday all have this in common this year: Friday, August 13. I turned 45 – let's hope that in itself won't be a re-run of an old horror movie. Actually, I feel quite hopeful about coming to some sort of peace, whether it comes from staying or going. Finding peace and arriving at a plateau where I can accept what's happened and feel like I can trust my husband is something I will strive for. I'm always aware of the location of that exit door, tho'.  Every once in a while I catch a drift of trust, and like a magic carpet it carries me swishing past  the money problems, the I'm-not-as-attentive-a-parent-as-I-should-be problems, and the infidelity problems: is he up to it again? How can I find out? He's keeping things from me that need to come forward? Etc. What calm and relief I feel, scooting by those painful potholes - It's almost out-of-body great. Sailing, swimming through air. Indominable. I think it's because of the contrast: how very low I've been, and for so long, the short sweet highs are almost unbearable in their lightness. . . . So fleeting, tho'. Trust is something you build with another person. I feel likesomebody gave me the wrong tools; I want to do it, but can't get the stones to fit snug and hold together. Somthing's still missing.

      My son, who is six but because of his height people mistake for 7 or 8, has been making frequent trips on his bicycle around the tiny, hilly road we live on. It's a distance of maybe 6/10 of a mile. The road makes a horseshoe, opening onto a larger road at either end. Our house is one of 2 on a steep and windy spur off this tiny road. The motivation for his travels is of course, a girl. She is 2 years his senior (going into 3rd grade). He became smitten with her last year during their 45 minute bus rides together when she lived at a different address in our town. Now that her family has moved to our road, we worry a little that his visits may quickly change from 'oh, isn't he cute', to 'oh no, he's here again!' .   When my husband was pursuing a beautiful former co-worker a couple of years ago, he'd email her daily. He'd compliment her on her looks and sexiness, always trying to steer her into recapping for him her previous night's masturbation session or telling of earlier sexual adventures. Although he couldn't recognise it, she got bored of him, and then got bored of leading him on for her own ego-boosting pleasure. He went on happily and ignorantly, aggressively trying to get her to meet him for a tryst, (a whole year after their first and only sexual encounter) persistant to the point of foolish.  My hope is that son won't follow father's footsteps. I hope he'll be sensitive and know when enough is enough. Maybe he'll even be smart enough to not betray his wife.

      I feel I should introduce myself, shake hands or something.  The fact is, I've been addressing myself to you for a long time, and have a bit of a backlog of things to put forth. I want this to be an exchange because I need information. It's about a life that I'm ready to recreate. Basically, I'm open to (almost) anything. Tomorrow, with a head that's free from the influence of the delicious rosé that was the silk thread woven through the outdoor dinner of roast chicken, fresh-dug potatoes and herbed summer vegetables with my vinaigrette (how do you spell that in English? Vin [wine ]- aigre [sour] = vinaigre, so vinaigrette??) I will begin the story. The children are in bed; the katydids are making an unconcionable racket. Maybe tonight my husband will reach over and touch me - not with the "you did a great job today - thanks. Oh, by the way, fabulous dinner" pat on the back or ass, but maybe with some desire. Relieve this ache I have – the way I rub away the growing-pains in the legs of our children. I'm waiting.
