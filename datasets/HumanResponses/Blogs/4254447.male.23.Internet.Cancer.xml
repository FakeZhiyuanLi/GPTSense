         WWE RAW Report - August 16, 2004       Live via satellite from  London, Ontario     Hosted by: Jim Ross and Jerry "The King" Lawler        Well, tonight really is the  Dawning of a New Era ...you see, while 24 year old Randy Orton won his first of what will be many World titles last night from The Crippler at  SummerSlam , tonight with this very episode of Monday Night  Raw , I make my return to weekly internet wrestling writing or whatever you want to call it. Basically this is a forum for my thoughts and opinions on everything WWE and even  urlLink TNA . Or whatever I feel like at any time. So if you start to seeing movie reviews and random thoughts, don't be surprised. Right now though, I'm going to focus solely on  RAW  and  Smackdown  and all things WWE. So with that, let's get to it.  SummerSlam  was last night in T-Ont and was off the chiz-arts as John Cena might say...      God, the  urlLink Olympics  are fucking gay. It would've been cooler if Kurt Angle had gone ahead and trained to go this time around. Angle vs. Rulon Gardner...just wasn't meant to be.       They Refuse to See the Change in Me Why Won't They Wake Up?  - I love that theme, dude.       Randy Orton - the new World Champion gets announced to the ring by Lillian Garcia to start the show. No doubt about it, he looks great with that strap over his shoulder. Balloons, confetti - the whole spiel for Randy. Randy was on the cover of the Toronto Sun this morning. That's very cool mainstream coverage for the WWE, who were all over the place in Canada over the weekend promoting the show. The Sun is part of Canoe, while produces a site I  used  to work for  urlLink Slam! Wrestling . Anyway - one helluva long, important feeling entrance for Orton. JR and King build up his "address to the masses" big time. Randy begins by explaining how he proved all his doubters wrong by sustaining all of Benoits offense to become the youngest champion in Federation history. He then has all of the fellow 24 year old males stand up and then take a good look at what an average 24 year old looks like - not even in the same league as Orton(whose probably been fed some sort of steriod since birth by his Daddy). The camera men cut to some of the fugliest 24 year olds in the audience, which sucks because they're subtlely making fun of their core demographic. Orton proclaims that he not only better looking but just plain better. He says his win over Benoit was not a fluke - it was Destiny. A helluva recap video plays displaying in great detail all of Randy's accomplishments leading up to his match last night. It put Randy over very well for any newer fans out there who might not be too sure about Orton. After Randy goes on a while about how great he is he proclaims the start of the Randy Orton era which gets interupted - thankfully I think - to a nice pop by Chris Benoit. Benoit lets him in his best Stu Hart voice that his first title defense is against him. Orton wants to hold off a couple of weeks, but Benoit says he just got the OK from Bischoff and he's using his rematch clause TONIGHT!  JR proclaims tonight will be Destiny - the overuse of the word is killing me. We go to commercial and I go to the refrigerator for another beer.        Smackdown  is coming to my neighbor Spokane next month. I will of course be there front and center to harass my dear wrestling friends.        MATCH 1 = Rhyno vs. Sylvan Griener     So the gimmick here is if Rhyno loses he and Tajiri never get a shot at the Tag titles again, and if Rhyno wins he and the Jap get a shot at  Unforgiven  on September 12 - the day after - in Portland, Oregon. Grenier takes the early advantage while Rob Conway DDT's Yoshihiro on the outside. JR likes the potential of the ECW alum. Potential what? Those two should be main eventing against the Benoits and Guerreros in a perfect world of great storytelling. Sylvain continues working on Rhyno in the ring while Conway - with his MAN beard fully grown in Frenching him up to the max - screams sweet nothings on the outside. Sylvain holds the Man Beast in a head/neck lock for an almost Orton-like length of TV time to my dismay. Rhyno powers out and hits a nice powerslam. Nice catch as catch can ensues with Rhyno hitting a good looking belly to belly. Conway inserts himself in the match which gets Rhyno's attention long enough for Sylvain to get a suplex and nearfall. Tajiri jumps on the apron then and hits Sly with his green MIST and Rhyno hits a GORE GORE GORE -  Vote Kerry  - for the win and the title shot. I hope they give them the titles finally. The match good for what it was, and that was another in a stream of segments putting over the tandem of ECDub guys.       Back to Ross and Lawler who talk up the soap opera that is the Lita, Kane and Matt Hardy story. Lawler throws it to his broadcast partner Kane who announces his wedding to Lita will be next week at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim on RAW. Lawler laments about seeing Kane kiss his new bride and I ponder the return of Shawn Michaels to the very arena he won his first WWF title at so many moons ago to get revenge on the Big Red Machine. Oh it will happen, HBK will ruin the wedding and save Lita - I can almost guarantee it. JR announces Kane's first wedding present and it's an IC title shot against Edge and it's BY GAWD next!      Vid-cap recap of the Hardy-Kane match from Slam and the finish with the ringbell and Kane's eventual killing of Mattitude with a chokeslam from the top rope.       The Coach tries to get a few words from Lita who walks right into a bridal shower by the  heel  Divas of the WWE. Molly gets Lita condoms and birth control. She also receives a couple of pictures and a vibrator in a box. Lita leaves sort of pissed and then Victoria comes from off screen and slaps Trish across the face just for the fuck of it. I miss the crazy bitch Vic.      Like I said - and a video now proclaims it - HBK returns soon and the crowd in Ontario sound less than enthused at the prospect of having to watch Shawn until the eventual eye to eye were all waiting for him to have with Bret. And from what I hear the Bret Hart return to the WWE will be sooner rather than later now.        MATCH 2 - Victoria vs. Gail Kim     They work a few cool spots to start and about a minute in after a nice kick to the back the crowd gets dead sleepy silent. All this while Lawler talks about the vibrator Lita got. I bet Kitty needed one. Hebner gets the obligatory "You Screwed Bret" chant as the fans start to get bored. I think I even hear a "Goldberg" chant fleetingly too. Vic hits the Widows Peak - the only cool moveset in womens wrestling. Post match, Trish runs down and nails Victoria and then Tyson Tomko manhandles her a bit until Stevie Richards in drag runs down to make the save. At least I think it was him. Short match, though- but it put over Trish as the dominant female in the division and Vic as her top babyface contender.        MATCH 3 - IC title - Edge(C) vs. Kane    Kane gets the fiery entrance of proudness. He's so happy to be having a sham shotgun wedding with a woman who may or may not be the mother of his baby. He dedicates this match to his Bride to Be...Liiita. I love the way he says that. JR is repulsed. What by this whole storyline or just the lack of anything better to do with Matt Hardy? I think someone in Stamford just loves to fuck with the Kane character and puts him in whatever they want cause he's fairly durable. Anyway, Edge makes an entrance to some mild pops I think. The crowd seems torn on him. Kane works him to start but Edge gets to work on his legs for a while and heels around the ring, which basically means he plods and doesn't play to the crowd like he used to when he wore yellow and shit. Lawler asks a completely viable question when he ponders where Kane and Lita are registered. At that point Lita - fake baby belly and all - makes her way to ring and cameras are so frightened they cut to commercial. After the break we find Lita playing dumb on the outside. It's not too tough a part for Amy to play nowadays. Kane works over Edgey with a bunch of power moves and then sets him in - again - the patented Orton headlock of TV time killing doom. Lita looks like Molly Ringwald all fucked up with Kane sperm on the outside. I think she'll make a great Sensational Sherri like heel very soon. Edge beats Kane on the outside and hits a missle dropkick to pop the crowd. A high impact clothesline by Kane just about takes Edges head right off. Kane takes awhile to get to the top rope so E meets him at the top but Kane fights him off and of course the ref goes flying too. Kane then nails his clothesline from the top. JR actually thinks that'll do it for poor Adam. Uh, no. Lita grabs Kane's leg and gets his attention and just as Edge goes for his spear Kane turned boots him. That brought out Matt Hardy who hits a WICKED Twist of Fate to send him packing...which sucks...and that's enough for Edge to recover and hit Kane with a spear for the win. Boring match, I just wanted it to end. I've seen it before and I think we all knew Kane wasn't going to somehow win the title after they could've given it to Batista the night before. Kane brings Lita into the ring and tells her he's not mad. He see's exactly what type of relationship he's going to have with Lita. They put over the damned wedding again like it's the best thing ever. It's going to suck and it's just a platform for Shawn Michaels to nail his fucking superkick. Kane says he's looking forward to the hell of a honeymoon and blows his load of Pyro! to end the segment. Lita does her best "fuck you" look as he goes to the back and we cut to commercial.       I don't give one fuck about the Diva competition. I have kindly sat and fast forwarded through every week of this dribble. I'm sure Carmella - the Playboy playmate - will end up winning this whole thing. From what I hear the Dodgeball thing at SummerSlam last night was fun for what it was though. Carmi is a hottie - and talks some shit about Joy having babies and that's funny cause all the little Kiebler marks just voted her off. And that Joy has some incredible Boobs. They all vote off Carmella cause she's the defacto heel by being the biggest name in the group. Coach ends the segment - which was kept short this week and no Kamala unfortunately - by voting Michelle off the WWE island.       Back to actual wrestling on a WRESTLING show with:       MATCH 4 - Chris Jericho vs. Batista with Ric Flair    I really wanted Batista to win the IC gold last night. I thought it was in the stars, but it probably didn't work into the companies plans to have both Randy and Dave go over getting the belts at the same major PPV. Batista dominated the start of the match and Jericho actually gets one move in before The Nature Boy interferes and trips Y2J. This allows some  ploddingheelwork  by Batista - but the whole match gets turned up a bit by Jericho. JR - Batista to Bulldog at one point which is interesting. Flair gets the ref's attention and Jericho nails Batista with the bulldog. Ric then hit Jericho and the ref calls the DQ finish. Blah. That was short and all the sudden Edge runs down but doesn't completely help Jericho at all - he just runs around - sort of exposing that he's turning heel and could care less about Jericho. Batista powerbombs J again for good measure. Batista should be the champ, but that's cool. Soon enough for Levi. Edge must be wearing contacts now to make his eyes look normal or something.       More Divas crap after a commercial and they're at least in bikinis this time. Only 6 girls left, so I can safely throw my votes at Christy and Carmella. But again, I don't care. I'm so over WWE T&amp;A - they might as well hire back BB or Sunny for all I care. I'd rather see Sytch on TV again than any of these Diva Search broads, but that's just me a 23 year wrestling fan.       JR and Lawler talk more about the video invitation to the Kane-Lita wedding. Drive it into the ground guys.       Triple H dressed to the nines in the dressing room. He totally foreshadows the Evolution turn on Orton by noting how Flair didn't even win his first coveted NWA title until he was like 31 or something. That also Batista is gunning for the belt. He wants Randy to rely on what brought him to the dance. Hunter is the Game, Hunter is legend, Hunter is the Boss's Son in Law. Hunter wants Orton, so here goes.        MATCH 5 - Raw World Title - Randy Orton(C) vs. Chris Benoit     Benoit looks great and jacked up. But I'm still trying to be open minded I guess about his loss last night of the title to Randy. I haven't seen the match, but really it may be that it was a one move match. That damned Diamond Cutter, RKO whatever you wanna call it. Orton's first entrance as champion is quite nice, but Benoit just almost seems to exude wanting it more. Is it great acting or the simple fact that all Hart graduates of the academy have a certain aurora aroudn themselves about the sport. Benoit comes right at Orton hard. They're saying he's desperate. Benoit hits him with a number of blows and suplexes. The guy is just always in such fine form as JR talks about the pressure boiling over for Chris. Short comeback from Orton turns into some Flair chops -  Whooo!  Benoit hits a nice superplex but only got a two count. As a lifelong fan I'm about to siop caring about two counts, but as a student of the game they're important to the psychology of a match and fan reaction, right? So alright Benoit tries a Sharpshooter which is about the 6th reference - albiet subtle which is just like Vince - to Bret and his imminent return. After some back and forth finally gets him in Bret's move and the Canadians bust a nut. Benoit is just rabid and really rough with Orton as he attempts a suplex to the outside, but Orton turns it around to a dropkick to the outside barrier. It seems like it's Lawlers job to put over how much of a ladies man Randy is after winning the title last night, and being with 5 women as though he really was the second coming of Ric Flair and Space Mountain. In all reality Randy's either as gay as Pat Patterson at a San Francisco gay wedding or most likely he did party a tad bit last night but was respectable and in bed and ready to go for his next show. As I knew would happen, Orton went to his trusty headlock of TV time killing doom and held Benoit in it for a good long while by my ADD standards. Where's Monday Night Football when you really need it? As Benoit breaks out of the headlock, Randy somehow hits Chris with a nice neckbreaker. Back to the fucking headlock for Randy, though. Crowd gets behind Benoit as the headlock continues and continues and Benoit breaks again which is inevitable. But again another neckbreaker by Orton. JR renotes and reminds me in the process that Orton is from wrestling capital in a sense Kansas City - home of greats like Harley Race. Randy spat on him. And Race still has a receipt for that I bet the next time they hit Kansas. Anyway Evolution eventually make their way down to the ring and distract Benoit just enough for Randy to nail the RKO and get the win. Post match Evolution celebrates with Randy and as Batista raises him on his shoulders Hunter motions for Young Randy's demise. So the mass beatdown of Randy ensues and the hopes of him being the next babyface Rock begin. Hunter punches the hell out of him and bloodies him up. Batista hits a nice Demon Bomb or whatever he calls it. Pretty much sets up Hunter taking the title down the road as he nailed him with a great Pedigree and stood tall with the World title. Maybe it's just that I never got to care enough about Randy in Evolution, maybe another year or two of the four guys together would've done it. Like the Horseman. Always has to be like the Horseman. But they rushed it and Randy is too young and it's just not believable that he will beat Triple H, unless it's some sort of Shelton Benjamin like roll-up which even for Orton, as World Champion, has to be considered an upset. Nonetheless, the show was overall very enjoyable and aside from the Diva segments which were shorter of course flowed really well. They got all of SummerSlam recapped from their side and left some nice cliffhangers for next week. And that brings me to another part of my RAW report - the Cliffhanger...       RAW CLIFFHANGERS -  What'll Happen Next Week, Dude?             So the major cliffhanger they left us with this week is how will Randy Orton react to be jumped by his supposed friends and mentors in Evolution. What direction will go? Who will his friends be? Will he even have any?  His character has so isolated himself with Hunter, Dave and Ric that to put him with anyone else after his antics with Foley, The Rock, HBK and Race among others would seem thoughtless. He can't very well team with Shelton and Edge will be a heel soon, but I'm tired of those two wrestling each other already. People are already talking about Randy possibly holding the title until Wrestlemania 21! I sure the fuck hope not, that's quite a bit longer than the Benoit reign and completely undeserved. I sort of hoped he'd drop the belt to Benoit tonight, but wishful thinking in today's Triple H structured WWE isn't right thinking. I see him possibly holding it through Survivor Series where he'll job it to Hunter or maybe Edge or whatever. Rumbles of Hunter vs. Randy at WM21 though, so who knows.        What will happen with the Kane-Lita marriage. The only way to find out is to tune in next week, huh!?  Will Lita go through with it? Will Matt Hardy show up? How 'bout HBK? He wants a piece of the Big Red Machine too! Maybe Marty Jannetty will show up, Rocker Drop Shawn and announce he's the real father of Lita's baby and he's full of Martyittude. Ya, never know.        Will Edge finally turn to the dark side? Will Christian return? Will he heel his brother or what? And when exactly will Shelton Benjamin return to the IC title picture?  I really thought Edge was going to job the title last night in Toronto to Batista with some Christian interference, but I was way off...it's only a matter of time though. There's a bunch of young dudes in the IC division, most are healthy now and aside from Trip and Regal it's a young man's game on RAW now. Kane is stuck with himself and the rest of the boys are just that...boys. Shelton will get a run with the IC gold soon I think, at the hands of a heel Edge which is a good enough reason to see Unforgiven where I bet he'll heel(get it?) on either Benoit or the World Champ himself under the right circumstances.       Will Rhyno and Tajiri get the gold?  I'd bet the house they do get the gold at the PPV, La Resistance - while entertaining - aren't as over as a nice run with Taj and Ry would be. They're both underused and need something. I wanted to see a Rhyno-Benoit World title fest but to n  o avail.       Find out all these questions and more next week, eh? I'll be back with random blurbs and shit and I've got some movie thoughts I want to get down in the next few days. Smackdown is of course Thursday - with a constant Bret watch in effect since Saturday. He could pop out of his gopher hole anytime now.     RAW Rating: 8/10
