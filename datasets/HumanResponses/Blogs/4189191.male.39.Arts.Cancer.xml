       This post is dedicated to a friend, who probably doesn't even consider me one, but who sent me a beautiful, whimsical piece.    It is a strange phenomenon isn't it. Sometimes you meet someone, and without reason take a instant dislike for that person. Or you meet someone and take a instant liking to them. For no sane reason, you may not even know that person, you may not even know their names, their likes or dislikes, but you like them. Sometimes, too, when they hurt, you hurt too. When you see them happy, you feel happy. You, whether that person knows it not, and it does not matter really, are his (or her) friend. Sometimes you may never meet them face to face, sometimes never meet them again. But it doesn't matter. You are their friend. Sometimes you become your brother's keeper. You look at a face, and it memory of someone you knew long ago, it may be an image your mind created of a character from a book...      Sometimes too, you look at a person and say: This is Estella, this is Pip. I know an old  pacik  and I think, this must be what the old man from the Old Man and the Sea must look like.   For no reason at all....  One of the greatest joy of being human. The gift that came, along with many curses, with the opposing thumb.  All night yesterday, and all of today so far, I have been feeling melancholy. Whimsical.  And I can't help but find lines, long thought forgotten, ones I did not even remember that I remembered, coming to me. In small little snippets, a couplet here or a quartet there. In Urdu and in English.  From one of my father's ghazals:   Hamesha aati thi aahat kisi ke khadmaon ki Hazaar dhoonda magar koi naqsh e paa na mila.   (I heard the soft footfalls, of someone's coming I searched, a thousand times, but found not footprints anywhere.)  Then there is Shelly: who can forget him. When you sit down to talk poetry, think poetry, it is inevitable that his name should come, and his words, haunting verses.   First our pleasures die, and then, Our hopes and our fears, and when These are dead, the debt is due Dust claims dust and we die too.   Then this little quartet comes to mind, all of a sudden, floating like it was always there. It was too late to get up and see if I have any book of his verses, to late and pensive to switch on the computer and see if I can find any more of his verses on the net. If someone reading this remembers any more of his poems please send them to me. Norman McCaig it the poet's name. And I think, am not sure though, that it is from a poem called Ego.   Time only knows: Creation's cross purposes and will Destroy the Evidence To keep it secret still.   And then came William Blake, a poet I never particularly admired, out of blue, a wonder what baggage we carry in our head. From childhood to adolescence, from youth to adulthood, from there to old age.   The priest sat by and heard the child In trembling zeal he seized his hair He led him by his little coat And all admired his priestly care.     To that friend I would want to say, whatever happens, never let the passion die. And from what little I know of you, which is nothing, there are stories in you that needs to be told, there are books that need writing. A feeling - that asks me to ask you (and not tell) - please write. The among the three libraries, the Library of the Unwritten is the largest. Don't let your books and stories linger there. The Library of the Unpublished, slightly smaller is more tolerable, because with each book there a hope remains that it might, one day, find itself in the Library of the Published Books. Some day, even posthumously, some one might discover its beauty, feel its joy and share its sorrow.   Khuda Hafez (In God's Care)

      The other day I went out for dinner.  It was a nice little place, not too brightly lit, just a shade secluded. Wife and I were having a nice time. We lingered on, I ordered another glass of juice to give the waiter a reason not to look at me with a cross eye. There were others lingering around too.  Two were specially interesting. One, it seemed was an avid believer of censorship and the other not. Both were enjoying the aftermath of delicious food eaten with aplomb. Both were using a toothpick. (Each, of course, not the same one.) The use of those toothpick has always beguiled me. The ones found in many restaurants, thin and fragile ones. They always seem to crumble in my hands, try as much as I may. I once even told myself, auto-suggested in fact, that it was not a toothpick I was holding but my darling who was in a devastated state of mind and need careful, caressing touch, it still broke in two.   You can draw only one of two conclusions: My wife is a hardy woman, or quote the last four lines of Emerson's Fable and say he was right.  Back to the two, let's give them names, for convenience. Bush and Kerry would have been fine, but let's stay apolitical and call them John and Jane, the two Does.  Now, Jane was using the toothpick and had placed a palm over her mouth as she picked her teeth. That was censorship at the extreme. I was staring, of course, at John who held no such notions. His mouth was wide open, I could see the inside of his beautiful orifice. What grace, what belief in freedom, what a display of abandonment, why couldn't more people be more like him. Why couldn't our government be more like him. It takes courage to expose yourself to such public scrutiny.   And what a gainly sight, what marvelous display of beauty! Could the Grand Canyon compete with this? Could the Great Barrier Reef hold a candle to it?  I mean, who wouldn't want to look at the perfectly structured set of teeth, with the coffee and tobacco stains making a most abstract of arts on a canvass so unique! His gums beginning to ooze just a hint of pus looked like a sheer miracle of creation. Better than an orgasm. The little bits of food being scavenged -- proclaiming in complex motions of the tongue as it found them from the end of the stick and sent them back to the stomach where they belonged -- brought to mind and life the visionary words  'waste not, want not.'  I glanced at Jane, my heart went out for her. It always does for the underdog. She was losing this race to sublimity. Jane was falling way short. Oh why couldn't she learn from the noble example of mankind sitting before her. Oh why? Why? I found myself goading her, willing her to gather that second wind and make a sprint.  "Pick you nose, girl, pick you nose!" I let out a soundless scream, hoping the telepathy classes I have been taking lately might come to some use.

      One of the best descriptions of glass I have read goes like this:  "No defination of glass is satisfactory in terms of describing all the permutations of this remarkable material. Physically it is a paradox, chemically it is idiosyncratic, artistically it is challenging, pragmatically it is ubiquitous, prismatically it is spectacular, ocularly it is both far and near seeing."  Glass is classified as a liquid. Yup, even though it seems solid, it is a liguid in a supercooled state. Its molecules in a permanent state of disarray.

      If you go to the comment section of the first post, you will notice some interesting comments.  You must have heard of people who write letters, venomous or professing admiration and not put their name to it. Now here are couple that do the other way round. They put their names and forgot to write the message.  But couldn't they be a little original, if they were swearing at me. I mean, didn't they go to school, didn't they have some sort of swearing competitions, where the best combination of four letter (or more) words could get you a free tea at the canteen?  Motherfucker, one said, and Sisterfucker, said another. Or maybe the same guy or gal (I don't want to sound sexist) posted twice. Be creative please!!  You know if you said something like: "I will put a bed in your mother's cunt and fuck your sister there." You might have sounded better, filthy but still worth of attention and maybe a nod of appreciation for the having said something and said it well.  Or swear in French. Or Urdu. Or Farsi. Since a famous Ayatullah is no more you can be sure there won't be any fatwa out for you. Don't try German though, it will sound like someone was clanging a tool-box at my my ear. (My cousin-in-law with her German husband is here and could resist taking a swipe at him) Or you could swear in Arabic, that would be something. Have never heard any proper swear words in Arabic.  Do try again. In Swahili or Sanskrit, your choice.

      He saw Blue sky at night And purple moonlight Streaming through the window.  Okay doesn't make sense, but I swear it did when I first thought of it. After a night at the Mezzo at the KL LitFest, drunk and sleepy I went up to the room humming this words, and more. I did not write it down, and what a torture it is when that happens. You know you have written a beautiful poem and can't remember the words.  Have been reading Dina Zaman's blog lately and have been inspired to make a blog of my own. First time blogger.   And her latest one makes me think...  How do we do it, have a day job and get the strength and motivation to go home and do some writing? Most evenings I plonk myself down on the couch and see life passing by. I squandered the time as a youth, and now the grey hair creeping in into the beard mock and laugh at me. I told you so they say, I told you so.  Oh, to be able - financially - to write full time. Create sentences, weave them into a meaningful, interesting, worthwhile body of work.  Two of my gurus, Nissim Ezekiel and Dom Moraes are dead. I studied under the former, I was in awe of the latter. Both dead and gone. And I remember, I remember: Once Nissim was heard telling someone about me, "this boy, mind, this boy, sometimes it seems the words stand before him, palms joined and say 'use me, use me, I would be perfect here'".  He must be turning in his grave, the kindly, gentle Jew. For today it seems I am a pauper, and words like mistresses that clung to me when I was rich.   ... to be continued later tonight.

      You can come in now.  I have padded - protected, My heart, my chest, my guts, Even the one on my sleeve With, A thick layer of indifference, A dash of disdain, A pinch of ignorance too. (Mix last thing first, of course, Stir it to a viscous state. Bin Laden uses this mix For his bunkers, I have heard.)  I have dulled, My senses too With cocaine I stole from a school going boy. My eyes are misty, as it is, (Arcus senilis, prematurely set, they say.)  Enter, come. You can come in now. I can meet you at last, on your terms.

      Well, that was a nice post from  urlLink Dina Zaman . Had a nice Saturday afternoonly feel to it. Writers and writing. I have plenty more to say on that but will resist the urge. Some things are best left for another day.  A literary class, where some guidance on reading and dissection is more helpful. And a gathering of writers where you can exchange theories and ideas is better. SO I think even though I may have to excuse myself from the next gathering at Sharon's, I am sure everyone will find it quite valuable. Johnson had Boswell, Steinbeck had Covici (and oh where is mine, where is mine) a person who can be your sounding board helps a lot.  But writers should, aspiring ones or the ones who have been writing for some time, must read. Books that make them think and ponder, styles that make you pause. One such book I read was Nahjul Balagha (The Peak of Eloquence) a collection of sermons and sayings of Ali Ibne Abu Talib. Not for the religious reasons but for the content and style, it makes you wonder for a long time. I wish my Arabic was good enough to be read it in the original, but even the translation by Syed Razi (I believe) is awesome.  Alas, someone stole my copy, have been trying to get one but... Please if you find a copy for sale anywhere, do let me know.  But now, I have to go: I have been wondering about the theory and practice of autoerotic asphyxiation. That happens, you know, when your wife is pregnant and you are not getting some.  'Night  PS: I have heard the book is available on the internet, but reading a book and especially such a book doesn't sound appealing.

      I have been told: my posts are too damn long. I have been told they are bit boring too. The bit, I am sure was added for politeness.  Brevity, I always lament, has never been my strong point. I don't know when to stop, even if I get talking. Years of literary silence does that to me... at least that's what my shrink's dead mouse says.   And Dizzy's third cousin, twice removed, says that too. "I red yuar pos, to much lang."  She should know, of course.  They tell me I quote a lots dead poets. And Mir Taqi Mir, Mirza Ghalib, Daag and such are of no interest to an average joe and jill in the street. And that's a pity.  But I agree about the long posts. Will try to keep them short.  But there is one post I have to write, 'lang wan' too. Me, Myself and God. Well after that if you don't hear from me, know that I have been stoned to death or am lying in prison for committing blasphemy. Or may they just cut off the tongue and fingers, so I can't talk or type. Or maybe they cut off.... no that should be for adultery, if it is.   That will make Dizzy happy of course: "After three thousand seven hundred and eighty four years, silence at last, peace at last!"

      I realise I am Old. I have a story to tell for every occasion...  Check this page:  urlLink Eat, Blog & Leave   Once a boy came and asked me. "Mom asked me to get a book from you, uncle. Run and Martini."  "You mean Wren and Martin, don't you, boy?"  "No Uncle, Run and Martini."  He dashes out to his mother then who is waiting in the car. She calls from her hand phone.  "Aiyah, this boy he don't know how to talk also. Pls give him the Run and Martini grammar book."  "Sure, thank you."

      I have quite a few e-mail's asking me who is Dizzy.  Well, I think I need to clear the air. Dizzy is a figment of my imagination. Period.  But I could, as any decent writer of fiction tell you more about her, give you details, even though details of fictional characters are usually given on the need to know basis. Here goes.  She loves cats, because I hate them. She hates dogs because I love them. She loves sunrise because I hate them. She hates sunsets because I love them. She likes men and I don't. I like women, therefore she doesn't.  She doesn't like cricket and doesn't watch television. I am a cricket fanatic and a couch potato.  We do have one thing in common. She talks and I listen, I talk and she listens.  She was not born here. If you look up the sky at night, you will see the brightest star in the sky, towards the north, it is actually a group of three stars, the astronomers call them Sirius A, B and C. What do they know. The real names are Sothis, Satais and Anu. Dizzy came from the planet revolving around Sothis. (Don't mistake it for the one revolving around Satais - that is where Whoopi Goldberg came from.) She arrived here thousands of years ago, fed up with a husband who wouldn't buy her the solitaire she wanted, up to her neck with the boss who wouldn't double her pay every month as she wanted. She changes her name and identity from time to time.  She was Helen of Troy, oh so many years ago. She was Cleopetra - where the most useful thing she learnt, according to her, was that bathing in donkey's milk was good for her skin. That is how I met her too, she thought I was a donkey. Obviously, as if that needs saying, I was not.  She was Mrs Patrick Campbell and wrote to G.B. Shaw.  She was Kunti Devi, when she was in Indrasprastha, the regal queen of Pandu. Actually she wanted to be Draupadi then but when Vyas told her that as Draupadi she would have to marry the five Pandavas - all at once - she balked and took Kunti instead. She was Mary Stuart, the Queen of Scots, she was Antoinette when she chose France. She was not wicked all the time. She was also Florence NightingSomething and that dame who helped Father Damien treat the lepers. Who ever remembers the names of the good ones?  They are so boring, the wicked ones and the kinds ones will live for ever. For example, even a graduate could tell you it was Brutus who struck the fatal blow to Caesar. Tell, which PhD can tell me who quenched his thirst when he was battling the barbarians of Germany?  These days she has decided to make Malaysia her home. She heard that we don't read enough and wants to change that. (But will she succeed? It is debatable, as Helen she wanted peace, as Antoinetter she wanted to eradicate hunger and overty, go figure.) How do I know? As easy as two plus two is seven. I was there, all the time, every time. I won't tell you who I was and what I did. Just a clue: Good people are too darned boring. I came to this planet from a more distant planet. What's the point of telling you the name of the planet and the star. You can't see it, not even with the puny Hubble you put out there in space. But then, this isn't about me: so back to Dizzy.  Dizzy, in her current incarnation, is beautiful. That is if you don't set Aishwarya Rai as a standard. Then she is not. But since these things lie in the eye of the beholder, you have to trust what my eyes and ears and feelings behold.  When she smiles, she brightens up the room, or hall, or railway station. When she laughs you wish she never stop. Make that wish with caution though, if that comes true you have to visit Tanjong Rambutan to see her then. That's where they keep the people who laugh nonstop, right?  She is a bit flat-chested. And why? "Aiyah, three thousand years of heavyheavy boobs enough what. Want to relek sikit, mah." That's what she said, cross my heart.  But she is beautiful, any many ways than can be seen. She has a soft voice, she thinks and writes well. She writes well, yes she does, when mood takes her there. And you would wish she would write more. And these she is mad at me, doesn't answer my e-mails. She changes her phone often, so I can't call or send her a SMS.  She came to me in a dream last night. Yes, she has that power to enter dreams. We were playing making up rhymes, as we did in school.  I said:  "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy What a beauty, my, my, my."  She replied:  "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy Why don't you just drop and die."  Who is Dizzy? A beautiful flower that hasn't yet been discovered. A wonderful fragrance yet to be found. An exquisite creature that melts your heart.  Who is Dizzy? A figment of my imagination. Make imagination with a capital I.

      Finding a house can be so difficult at times. Even if you have the address, the proper name. Specially if you are from a small town and very new to the big city and their logic in street numbering.  The last course, usually the best, is to stop and ask.  So when I wanted to find the house of Haji Mohammad Zakariah Bin Haji Mohammad Zulkarnain in Taman Connaught, after having made several turns admiring the streets and their numbers, I stopped to ask.  I saw a gentleman walking back after his Maghrib prayers and if there is anyone you can take guidance from it is the pious. Unless, of course, they are wearing a green Arabic style jhubba and have long unkempt goatee and wear glasses of a darker shade. From them you stay away. No, really, some of them have a very clear knowledge if you are going to hell or heaven. Some very precisely too. Like one such person told me once I was going to rot in hell right next to soandso. I am afraid, these days, that someone might tell me I will have a place right next to George W Bush -- gone would be my hopes of intellectual debates for eternity.  Me: Samalekum, Encik. Boleh Tak?  G: Walekum Salaaaam  Me: "I am looking for this address, the name is Haji Mohammad Zakariah Bin Haji Mohammad Zulkarnain."   I thrust the slip of paper out and he squints at.  G: "Ha ji Mo ha mmad Za ka ri ah bin Ha ji Mo ha mmad Zul kar nain..."  Me: "Yeah, Encik."  G: "Is it M-O-H-D or M-O-H-A-M-M-A-D OR M-D?  Me: "No Sir, I think it is the way it is written."  G: "Ha ji Mo ha mmad Za ka ri ah.... hmmmm. Is it the same fellow whose daughter ran away and married a mat salleh?"  Me: "I am not sure, Encik, I have not checked his history of the Internet yet."  G: "Or is it the same fellow whose wife likes to dress like Siti Norhaliza?"  Me: "I haven't seen her yet, I can't tell you that."  G: "The same fellow whose daughter, the other one slapped my cousin because he said something to her? Same one whose son is drug addict. Always lepak, lepak one?"  I thought I will change my tactics, ignorance does not always pay.   Me: "Yes, exactly, I think that is the one. Now, could you tell me where his house is."  G: "Oh, sorry, I don't know. I am from Damasara, came visiting here."  Finding your way in KL is always a big deal for me. If you happen to be in the car and want to ask the guy waiting in the next lane for the light to turn green, you can do anything you want. He won't turn your way, he won't look sideways. And if he happens to he will pretend he did not see you. If it is a she then you will get a look that says she heard what you were saying about, what you would do to her on a lonely beach on a lonely night. "Go to Chow Kit you SOB," her looks would say.  Of course, all you wanted to do was ask them if you were on the right road. If it is indeed the Jalan Cheras.  Finding a house in a big city is always a tough nut. Every city has its own flavors.  If you were in Bombay, (I refuse to call it Mumbai, it was Bombay I knew and loved and Bombay it will forever be) you would get a different treatment. You will get a relay answer. Ask them how would you get to Andheri, you will be told to go straight till you reach the Kemps Corner then stop and ask someone for further directions. You begin to feel you are in a treasure hunt of sorts, you begin to get excited. And the chances are you would get to the place you wanted to go to and also make a few friends on the way.  Sometimes I think the Bombayites feel if they give the whole jigsaw away then you won't have any use for them. Some sort of inferiority complex maybe. Or it could be the other way round, they think non-Boambayites are just too dumb to be trusted with the complete directions. Bombay after all is a huge sprawling city where even taxi driver ask other taxi drivers for directions.  Lukhnow anf Delhi are different. You actually ask the directions and pretend you understand and nod your head. Their sing song way of speaking is so difficult to comprehend for someone who has lived in the South for so long. You realize that you are in what are considered the most cultured cities in India. And Delhi could qualify for one of the oldest in the world too. You just nod and pretend you understand, how cultured could you be if you can't understand their language?  Hyderabad is different. If you stop and ask for direction, the gentleman will stop whatever he doing and take a tea break. He will invite you to the nearest restaurant, ask you about your health and family. He will want to know where you are from, he will then look through the papers as the tea arrives, find the largest blank space he can find in the paper and draw a diagram for you. He will tear off the part of the newspaper and he will emphatically point to the place marked X with a blurb 'you are here' and tell you how to get to Y where you wanted to go.  Singapore, of course, is different. If you manage to snag someone to give you directions, he tell to go the opposite way you were going towards, then take a left turn at the first exit and a right and a left again till you find yourself at Woodlands.   Maybe it is his way of saying, if you can't fucking find your way with all the elaborate signboards you deserve to be lost.

      Old jokes... like old habits and bad memories, die hard. I just hate telephones, I hate to talk over it unless it is an absolute necessity. I hate the way my voice sounds over telephone. But back in the days when we had just got the telephone, that shiny black object of awe. With its rotary dial and all, I loved it. I would be the first to run to pick it up when a call came in. Oh! the excitement of answering a telephone call.  But then it began, as it invariably does, one dark and stormy night. (And they say we can't use the phrase anymore...)  I swear on the head of my cat named Dog and my dog named Cat, I could tell it was going to ring even before it did. I could feel the first ripple emanate from the pole outside, I could feel the pulse of electricity as it made its way down the black wires into the small box outside and then at last in the telephone. I would be there before it rang and one of out ten times I was right. Since no one is ever right on such matters even in that ratio, I think my claim stands.  Ring ring.  Other Person: "Halooo"  Me: "Walekum Hello was Rahmatullah e wa Bara...."  OP: "Haloooooooo"  Me: "Walekum hello, Rahmatullah Ka Bakra Tu Hai" The first time was sincere and in Arabic, but the second time had to change, so it literally meant, You are Rahmatullah's goat.  OP: "Halooo, is this Vengkipurapu Venkat Sai Laxman's house." It was three in the morning and honestly I did not even want it to be my house, let alone Vengkipurapu Venkat Sai Laxma's. I must also make note, that I slept by the telephone in the living room in a sleeping bag, just so I could answer it. I did that for a week.  Me: "No, Sir....."  OP: "This is Ramlal Shivanlal Gorenath Rathod."  Me: "If you say so, Sir, I believe you."  OP: "This IS Ramlal Shivanlal Gorenath Rathod."  Me: "I believe you Sir, It must be the Truth, I will swear it is so in a court if I have to, I will put my name on any affidavit if I have to...."  OP: "Haloooo."  Me: "Same to you, no shame to you. This is Shakeel Abedi Ibne Aziz Abedi Sibte Mustajab Abedi who came to Gulbarga from Navgawaan Sadaat in UP and whose great great great grandfather is buried in Nizamuddin, right near the Honorable Nizamuddin Oulia. He was the first one to come to India, Dada Imam, and he I believe came from - with his family and friends - from Karbala which is now and has always been in Iraq. He...."  OP: "Haloooo...."  Me: "Oh, the reason he traveled to India, and I assure you I have just speculative knowledge about this, though I am sure I can make educated guess, his grandfather came from Madina, they lived in a house very near the Jannat ul Baqi....."  OP: "So this is not Vengkipurapu Venkat Sai Laxman's house, I am not speaking to Vengkipurapu Venkat Sai Laxman?"  Me: "No sir, definitely not. I have a very reliable source for that, my school badge with the logo of the school and my name on it. My teacher would have known if it wasn't so. He is a very meticulous man, he even makes me cross my T and dot my I. He isn't easily fooled."  OP: "Oh, must be the wrong number, is this 25452?"  Me: "No Mr Ramlal Shivanlal Gorenath Rathod, Sir, this is 26892. I am sure I can see how you could have made the mistake, both start with two...."  And he put the phone back, what bad manners not to let me complete my sentence. I picked up my sleeping bag and went back to my room and my bed.  I heard at breakfast that my elder brother did not get a proper night's sleep, the phone kept waking him up in the early hours of the morning... As for me, I have always regretted not having been Vengkipurapu Venkat Sai Laxman that night. I have always wondered what desperate need compelled dear Ramlal Shivanlal Gorenath Rathod to call at such unearthly hour.

      After Frost, Bahadur Shah Zafar.  Some of the most heart breaking poetry of the time was written by the last of Mughal kings. He apprenticed under many poets of known, ending with lastly, Ghalib. He was exiled from India after the 1857 mutiny and lived and died in what now is Yangon.  I am a twinkle in no one's eye I am the peace of no one's heart That which is of no use to anyone I am a fistful of the mist  I am no ones's friend I am no one's enemy I am that devastated fate I am that fallen gate  My beauty was taken away from me My love was taken away from me That garden which in Spring went dry I am the bloom of that garden  Why should anyone say a prayer for me Or bring few flower to my grave Or light a candle I am that unkown, unmarked grave.  We were flicking through a magazine when Dina Zaman's article caught attention. Paul Baily remarked, why just women, they look like they could be God's gift to men too.   Mohd Rafi sang that song, without any music, without any instruments, and boy! was he good. That voice, Rafi's, was truly a gift to humanity.  Read  below the above translation in its original, or skip it. Thank you.  Na kisi ki aankh ka noor hoon  Na kisi ke dil ka qaraar hoon Jo kisi ke kaam na aa saka  Main wo ek musht e ghubaar hoon  Naa to main kisi ka habeeb hoon Naa to main kisi ka raqeeb hoon Jo bigad gaya wo naseeb hoon Jo ujad gaya wo dayaar hoon  Mera rang-roop bigad gaya Mera yaar mujhse bichad gaya Jo chaman fiza mein ujad gaya Main usi ki fasl e bahaar hoon  Kahe Fateha koi aaye jyon Koi chaar phool chadaye kyon Koi aake shama jalaaye kyon Main wo bekasi ka mazaar hoon

      Wasn't Frost who said:  Many have died of cancer, yes But more have died of broken heart.    The Road Not Taken       Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;  Then took the other, just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim Because it was grassy and wanted wear, Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,  And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I marked the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way I doubted if I should ever come back.  I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I, I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.   Robert Frost

      What NOT to read...  There certainly are some thing one shouldn't read, at least without a large dose of caution.  Mom's secret dairies could top the list.  One of the hardest things to imagine is that our parents could ever make love. I myself believe I was an immaculate conception. So were my brothers and my sisters. Nothing in the world will make me think otherwise.  Or erotic stories at the various sites avilable for free. You read them you will go to hell, honest. I got this from a very reliable source, my preacher.  Or the palm. Actually you should not lend it too, so no one can read it...

      I am working on a book that deals with the so called Police Action in India in 1948. A few people have been very helpful and their help is gratefully accepted and appreciated.  Mr Omar Khalidi of MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA Mr William Darlymple who doesn't need introduction. Mr Taqui Abedi who lives in Hyderabad and happens to be my brother. Ms Susan Wells of Oxford University.   I thought it would be prudent to put this on the blog. In case you know anything about the history of India from that time period, or know anyone who knows or might know.  Any help would be appreciated and acknowledged.

      ... should never be the question.  A writer who does not read is like the boy who says he wants to be a football player when he grows up and doesn't ever watch football.  Incidentally, (or was it?) the first that the prophet of Islam heard from Jibreel was "Read..."  Without having read voraciously, (that word voracious is beginning to sicken me, it has become a cliché, must find a better word) you can't ever hope to write. That's the first rule for a writer, any writer, and the second, and the third and the fourth. The fifth is to write.  Read anything that you can lay your hands, I have seen people, a writer in fact, finding nothing to read handy picked up the telephone book to read. Read everything you can. But the notion that you don't have to read should be banished. The notion that you don't have to read the classics should also be banished. Sure, one would hardly expect a young man today to read Chaucer (but he was serious about writing, I would suggest he read it too), sure Milton's Paradise Lost may mostly float above an untutored head (ditto comments), sure Iliad may seem a little corky and fantastic, but without having read them you couldn't begin to write.   Classics are not just the source of inspiration, they are the best teachers you can get. Hemingway was not the best when it came to understanding humanity, his insights into life may have not been earth shattering, but he was a damned good writer. He wrote with style. You wouldn't know that if you have not read him. And he was well read too.  Maugham wrote with utmost simplicity, and when asked how did he do that, he replied it took him a lifetime of practice. I was discussing Maugham with Paul Baily at the LitFest, wondering how such a wonderful writer was so least recognised. I read, from start to finish, his Liza sitting on a railway station bench. He was one of the best read writer of his time.   You have to read the classics. How else would you fall in love with Estella, how else would you feel a oneness with Pip, or David Copperfield. How else would you know a Macbethian turn a life is taking if you have not read Shakespeare?   I can't ever forget reading Tess of the d'Ubervilles and making a resolution that I would find a milkmaid and fall in love with her. I can't ever get the picture of Jane walking in the stormy night. I can feel the whiteness of her throat, I can see the blue-ness of her lips in the cold and unrelenting rain.   Read. That is the first step to salvation!  And classics, you must read them. I read this (in Urdu) pasted on restaurant walls and very nook and corner when the Tablighi people were in full swing. "You surprise me, you have no time for prayers?" And I transcribe it to reading. Cut an hour of TV, cut an hour of football (and not cricket, never ever, ever do that with cricket) and read. Take a book to bed.  Dizzy, I think, is going through a Kafkaisque nightmare. Words are fighting their way out of her, they are crawling under her skin, they are seeping out the pores of her skin. Some will soothe her, some will morph into unimaginable demons that will haunt her nights. Some will frighten her, some will make love to her. But that is a necessity, she will live through it and be a better person. Some will come out of her as screams and some will come out as giggles, some will dance around and will put their tongue out at her.   And you wouldn't know what a Kafkaisque nightmare is if you have not read Kafka. And if you haven't read Kafka, you might as well take all the books in your bookshelf and throw them in a river!     And if you have not read Freud's Interpretation of Dreams, what ever are you doing? Read, anything and everything.   This happened to some one else too, Marx I think? I was locked up in library one evening, was sitting and reading in a corner and did not know when the librarian closed the shop. I went back to reading the Federalist Papers. And is it the Kitabkhana blog that quotes the words (yes it is - I just checked) words from Borges: "I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library." And talking of Marx, how would you what an ill-conceived idea if you have not read Das Kapital?  Then when you have finished reading the classics, you will begin to appreciate what a powerful tool a word is. You will read the Old Man and Sea and come away with amazement that some could put so much into such a small piece of work. You will realize you don't need ninety thousand words to say something profound, and say it beautifully. You will read Of Human Bondage and feel how sometimes you have to taken pages and pages to say what you have to.  (You will also realize that 'A Suitable Boy' works very well as a door stopper.)  When you have read the classics you have to read your contemporaries. You have to know what the world is saying now. You have to keep up to the times, but most importantly, you have feed that unrelenting appetite for reading that has entered your system and won't let go.   And as you read and as you grow you might find suddenly that some of the books you read and admired as a youth don't seem that great after all. You wouldn't have know that if you had not read them in the first place. You may find Wordsworth a trifle too contrived, you may find Huxley a little pompous. But that is all right. That is growth, I find Shakespeare a little silly today, but I would not wish I had never read him. That is growth.  But read you must, as much as you can. You must read Steinbeck and Huxley, you must read Maugham and Dickens, you must read Hemingway and Proust. You must read too, as Dom Moraes once insisted I should, criticisms by Pound and Bagehot (Walter I think). You must read Bronte and Austen.   You must read in all languages that you know. You must read without prejudice.   What you must not read - if you find it on a bench, abandoned in a mall - is a terrorist's manual. That could get you in trouble. And you must read Satanic Verses and see for yourself why it more-howled-about-than-read book. But when you take it out you must cover it well with brown paper or print a cover of your own on your printer: "The Euclidean Principles and How They Support Preemptive War" by George W Bush. I am sure you design such a cover quite easily. No one will ask to see the book. And no! you don't have to read Euclid, but if you can, do.   You must and must and must read Dizzy's next book. And you must and must and must and must read my book when and if it comes out. (Its my blog so I am allowed an extra 'must' ain't I?)

      To a friend, whose I address I do not have, whose name I have forgotten.  To Dizzy, who will try to read the tongue twisting Urdu words here, roll her eyes and probably go read the assasin's next chapter. Oh, one day I will read Parchaaiyan to her, if I have glue her to a chair to make her listen.  Most may not understand or appreciate the Urdu verse in here, and I had no mood or time to translate all, if you are really keen on the meaning, email me.   Darling,  Since everyone has gone away to Melaka to visit relatives, I am alone and lonely. I can't stand being alone. I hate being alone. I hate silence. I hate everything around me. The walls seem like a prison. And I hate prisons.  What was that Wilde words:  I know not if the Laws be right Or if the Laws be Wrong. All we know, in goal who lie That the walls are strong Where each day is as long as a year A year whose days are long.  The best thing to do is talk about something else.  Lets talk of others. The great poets, the writers. No let us not talk of English writers. You know I know so little about literature, and you know so much about it. I wish I could fill your Hookah and massage your feet. These are not the olden times, apprenticeships are not done this way anymore, too bad.  Lets talk of poets. Mir Taqi Mir, Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib, Bahadur Shah Zafar, Sahir Ludhianvi, Keats, Shelly, Eliot. God! how many hours of beautiful verses they have given us. Truly thier beauty is joy for ever.  Mir makes me sad. His words are so simple and so to the point that he makes me sad. Remember this one?  Dil vo nagar nahi jo phir abaad ho sake Pachtaoge suno ye basti ujaad ke  (Heart is not a city that recovers from devastation / Listen to me, you will regret destroying it.)   Even Ghalib acknowledges Mir's genius:   Sunte hain agle zamaane mein koi mir bhi tha. (I have heard there was a Mir who lived before me.)  And then Mir again, who had this reply to not attending a symposium even though he was in Hyderabad at that time. The reply was to the Nizam of Hyderabad:  Kisi rais ki mehfil ka zikr hi kya hai Mir Khuda ke ghar bhi na jaayenge bin bulaye hue  (Speak not of a rich man's house, O Mir / I won't enter even God's house uninvited.  Mir makes me cry. Sahir impressed me a lot. His nazams were so revolutionary. Remember the Chakle from "Pyaasa". And that is also my first memory of Sahir, he came to our house, to visit us after Father had passed away in 73. And we made him read his Chakle, I can still recall his strong voice in the living room. Anyone who has not seen Guru Dutts "Pyaasa" I recommend you do it. One of the better films that came out of Bombay. Here is Sahir's Chakle:   Yeh Galiyan yeh Nilaam ghar dilkashi ke Ye lut te hue caravan zindagi ke Kahan hai kahan muhafiz khudi ke Sanaakhane tasdiqe mashriq kahan hain?  Ye purpench galiyan, ye bekhwaab baazar Ye Gumnaam raahi, ye sikkon ki jhankaar Ye ismat ke saude, ye saudon pe takraar Sanaakhane tasdiqe mashriq kahan hain?  Ye phoolon ke gajre, ye peekon ke cheente Ye be-baak nazren, ye gustaakh fiqre Ye dhalke badan aur ye madqooq chehre Sanaakhane..........  Ye bhooki nigahen haseenon ki jaanib Ye badte hue haath seenon ki jaanib Lapakte hue paon zeenon ki jaanib Sanaakhane.......  Yahan peer bhi aa chuke hain jawan bhi Tanomand bete bhi abba miyan bhi Ye biwi kisi ki , bahen bhi hai maa bhi Sanaakhane......  Madad chahti hai ye hawwa ki beti Yashoda ki hum jins Radha ki beti Payamber ki ummat Zulekha ki beti Sanaakhane.....  Zara mulk ke rahberaon ko bulao Ye galiyan ye kuche ye manzar dikhao Sanaakhane tasdiqe mashriq ko laao Sanaakhane.......  He changed the Sanaakhane line to "Jinhe Naze Hind hai kahan hai" And that was in direct answer to Nehru who had given a speech in which he said "Humeh Naaz hai Hind par"  Sahir was a unique case that made both a father and a daughter angry. If the above irritated Nehru, when Ghalib centenary was celebrated in 1969 at Chowpati, Bombay, Sahir came up with a bombshell while Indira Gandhi presided the function.   Ekkees baras guzre azadi e kaamil ko Tab jaake kahin hum ko Ghalib ka khayal aaya. Turbat hai kahan iski, maskan tha kahan iska Ab apne sukhan parvar zahnaon mein khayal aaya  Sau saal se jo turbat chaadar ko tarasti thi Ab uspe aqidaon ke phoolaon ki numaesh hai Urdu ke ta'aluq se kuch bhed nahi khulta Ye jashn ye hanggama khidmat hai ke saazish hai  Jin shehar mein goonji thi Ghalib ki nawa barsaon Us shaher mein ab urdu be naam o nishaan tehri Azadi e kaamil ka elaan hua jis din Ghaddar zaban tehri, maatub zaban tehri  Jis ahade siasat ne ye zinda zaban kuchli Us ahade siasat ko marhumaon ka gham kyon hai Ghalib jise kahte hain udru hi ka shair tha Urdu ope sitam dhakar Ghalib pe karam kyon hai  Ye jashn ye hanggama, dilchasp khilone hain Kuch logaon ki koshish hai, kuch log bahel jaaye Jo vaada e farda par ab tal nahi sakte the Mumkin hai ke kuch arsa is jashn par tal jaaye.  I would have loved to see Indira Gandhi's face then.  I am sure you have heard all these that I am repeating here, but just want to get over the melancholy, so just bear with me. And remember the Sahir nazam on Taj, I was so impressed with it that I too vowed never to go to Agra ever.   Taj tere liye mazhar e ulfat hi sahi Tujko is vaadi e rangeen se aqidat hi sahi Mere mehboob kahin aur mila kar mujhse  Bazm e shahi mein gharibaon ka guzar kya mani Sabt jis raah pe hon satvat e shahi ke nishaan Us pe ulfat bhari roohaon ka guzar kya mani  Anginat logaon ne duniya mein mohabbat ki hai Kaun kehta hai ke saadiq na the jazbe unke Lekin unke liye taskeer ka samaan nahin Kyon ke vo log bhi apni hi tarah muflis the  Mere mehboob unhe bhi toh mohabbat hogi Jinki sanaai ne bakhshi hai ise shakl e jameel Unke pyaaron ke maqaabir rahe benaam o numood Aaj tak unpe jalai na kisi ne khandeel Ye chamanzar ye Jamuna ka kinara ye mahal Ye munaqash dar o diwar, ye mehraab ye taaq Ek shahenshah ne banwaake haseen taj mahal Hum ghariboan ki mohabbat ka udaya hai mazaaq  Mere mehboob kahin aur mila kar mujhse.  That was a good reply to Hasrat. "Ek Shahenshah ne banwa ke haseen taj mahal . Saari duniya ko mohabbat ki nishaani di hai" And Shair told to fly kites. What does the king think, that I would not have built a Taj for my love?  Sahir was at his best when he was sarcastic. This one is supposed to have been written for Amrita Pritam. When she ditched him.  Musavir mein tera shahkaar vaapas karne aaya hoon.  Ab in rangeen rukhsaaron mein thodi zardiyan bhar de Hijaab alood nazraon mein zara bebaakiyan bhar de Labaon ki bheegi bheegi salvataon ko muzmahil kar de Numayan rang e peshaani pe aks e soz e dil kar de Tabassum aafreen chehre mein kuch sanjidapan bhar de Jawan seene ki maqrooti uthane sar nigoon kar de Ghane baalaon ko kam karde magar rakhsandagi de de Nazar tamkanat le kar mizaj e aajizi de de  Magar haan bench ke badle use sofe pe bithlaa de Wahan mere bajaye ek chamakti kar dikhla de  Wow. Let someone who betrayed for money read it. Enough to set fire to the heart.  His sarcasm was not just for women though, he was as sarcastic of the government too.  Remember the satire on the prohibition policy.  Sharaab ban karo ke abyehi buraee hai Ke jis se mulk ke izzat pe harf aata hai  Fasaad band hue loot maar band hue Har ek rasm jo thi naagawaar band hue  Libaas sil gaye nangi kunwariyon ke liye Makaan ban gaye beghar bhikariyon ke liye  Watan mein khair se berozgaar koi nahi Ye mansafi hai ke shikwagizaar koi nahi Koi mareez tarasta nahi dawa ke liye Koi zaeef bhatakta nahi asa ke liye  Sitam ka gham ka jahalat ka daur khatam hua Buland o past mashiyat ka daur khatam hua  Tameez banda o aga miti sab ek hue Wazie qadime millat raees nek hue  Sharab band karo...  Great is not it, his sense of satire.  And when he talked of love, he was a bit arrogant. He never spoke of betrayal as killing him, or destroying his life, he always held his head high, and arrogantly believed that she must be suffering too, as much as he was. Look at the song:  Chalo ek baar phir se ajnabi ban jaaye hum dono  Very poignant, wrenches the heart.  And it was supposed to have been written for Lata Mangeshkar. Including this one. And here too is the arrogance that I was talking about.  Tu bhi kuch pareshaan hai Tu bhi sonchti hogi Tere naam ki shohrat tere kaam kya aayi.  Mein bhi kuch pasheman hoon Mein bhi ghaur karta hoon Mere kaam ki azmat mere kaam kya aayi  Tere khwab bhi soone Mere khwab bhi soone Teri meri shohrat se Tere mere gham doone  Tu bhi ek sulagta ban Mein bhi ek sulagta ban Teri qabr tera fun Meri qabr mera fun  Ab tujhe main kya doonga Ab mujhe tu kya degi Teri meri ghaflat ko Zindagi sazaa degi  Tu bhi kuch....  Simple words, and yet they move you to tears.  And this one too makes me sad....  Teri tadap se na tadpa tha mera dil lekin Tere sukoon se bechain hogaya hoon main Ye jaan kar tujhe kya jaane kitna gham pohnche Ke aaj tere khayaloan mein kho gaya hoon main  Kisi ke hoke is tarah mere ghar aayee Ke jaise phir aaye toh ghar mile na mile Nazar uthayee magar aise be yaqeeni se Ke jis tarah koi peshe nazar mile na lile Tu muskuraayi magar muskarake ruk si gayee Ke muskarane se gham ki khabar mile na mile Gayi toh sog mein doobe khadam ye keh ke gaye Safar hai shart shareeke a safar mile na mile  Teri tadap se....  And this one I remembered the other day, when I heard you, the second time, you seemed so sad.  Tumhe udaas si paataa hoon main kayee din se  Na jaane kaun se sadme uthaa rahi ho tum  wo shukhiyaan, wo tabassum, wo qay_qahe na rahe  Har ek cheez ko hasrat se dekhti ho tum  Chupaa chupaa ke khamoshi mein apni bechaini  Khud apne raaz ki tasheer ban gayee ho tum  Meri ummeed agar mit gayee to mitne do  Ummeed kya hai bas ek paas-o-pesh hai kuchh bhi nahin  Meri hayaat ki gham gheenion ka gham na karo  Gham hayaat-e-gham yak naqash hai kuchh bhi nahin  tum apane husn ki raanayon par raham karo  vafaa fareb e tul havas hai kuch bhi nahin  Mujhe tumhare taghaful se kyon shikayat ho  Meri fanaa mere ehsaas ka taqaza hai  Main jaanta hoon ke duniya ka khauf hai tum ko  Mujhe khabar hai ye duniya ajeeb duniya hai  Yahaan hayaat ke parde mein maut chalti hai  shikast saz ki awaaz mein ruh e naghma hai  Mujhe tumhari judai ka koi ranj nahin  Mere khayaal ki duniya mein mere paas ho tum  Ye tum ne theek kaha hai tumhen mila na karoon  Magar mujhe bata do ki kyon udaas ho tum  Khafa na hona meri jurrat-e-takhatib par  Tumhen khabar hai meri zindagi ki aas ho tum  Mera to kuch bhi nahi hai main ro ke jii loonga  Magar khuda ke liye tum aseer e gham na raho  Hua hi kya jo zamaane ne tum ko cheen liya  Yahaan par kaun hua hai kisi ka soncho to  Mujhe qasam hai meri dukh bhari jawaani ki  Main khush hoon meri mohabbat ke phool thukra do  This too is a long poem, and the end lines go thus.  Yeh gham bahot hain meri zindagi mitane ko Udaas reh ke mere dil ko aur ranj na do.  Sometimes he seemed so oppressed that one can't help feel the pain. Look at this couplet  Jis ne is daur ke insaan kiye ho paida Wohi mera bhi khuda ho mujhe manzoor nahi  And talking of Sahir and not mentioning is Parchaiyan is not possible. One of the most poignant nazams that I have ever read, a master piece in not only thought but construction, the change of tone, the change of meter. It is no surprise that I remember each and every one of the hundreds of lines. It is a very long poem:  Jawan raat ke seene pe doodiya aanchal Machal raha kisi khwab a marmari ki tarah Haseen phool, haseen patiyan, haseen shaqein Lachak rahin hain kisi zulfe nazneen tarah Fiza mein ghul se gaye hain ufaq ke bazmoqutoot Zameen haseen hai khawabaon ki sarzameen ki tarah Tassawurat ki parchaiyan ubharti hain Kabhi gumaan ki surat, kabhi yaqeen ki tarah Wo ped jin ke takeh hum panah lete the Khade hain aaj bhi sakit, kisi Ameen ki tarah  Inhi ke saaye mein phir aaj do dadhakte dil Khamoosh hontaon se kuch kehne-sunne aaye hain Na jaane kitni kashakish se kitni kaawish se Ye sote jaagte lanhe chura ke laaye hain  (now in this parts delicacy of expession really is beautiful)  Yehi fiza thi, yehi ruth, yehi zamana tha Yehin se hum ne mohabbat ke iftedah ki thi Dhadakte dil, larazti hui nigahaon se Huzoor e ghaib mein nanhi si iltejah ki thi  Ek aarzo ke kanwal khul ke phool ho jaaye Dil o nazar ki duwain qubool ho jaaye  Tassawurat ki parchaiyan ubharti hain  Tum aa rahi ho zamane ki aank se bach kar Nazar jhukaye huye aur badan churae huye Khud apne khadmaon ki aahat se jhempti, darti Khud apne saaye ki jumbish se khauf khaaye huye  And the way he decribes the meetings, so lovingly, so crefully chosen words.  Mere palang pe bhikri hui kitaabaon ko Adaa e ijz o karam se utha rahi ho tum Suhag raat jo dholak pe gaye jaate hain Dabe suraon mein wohi geet gaa rahi ho tum  And look at this this, Oh Lord, such beautiful picture of innocent love.  Main phool taank raha hoon tumhare jode mein Tumahri aankh masarat se jhukti jaati hai Na jaane main kya baat kehne wala hoon Zaban khushk hai waaz rukti jati hai  Mere gale mein tumahri gudaz baahen hain Tunhare hontaon pe mere labaon ke saaye hain Mujhe yaqeen hai ke hum kabhi na bichde gein Tumhe gumaan hai hum mil ke bhi paraye hain  Sahir changes the meter and tempo several times in the nazam, and goes to describe how they used meet, and then the war came.  Woh lamhe kitne dilkash the, woh ghadiyan kitni pyaari thin Woh sehre kitne dilkash the, woh ladiyan kitni pyaari thin  ( but further down...)  Nagah lehekte kheton se taapon ki sadayen aane lagi Barood ki bpjhal bu le kar, pachim se hawayen aane lagi Taameer ke roshan chehre par taqreeb ka badal phael gaya Har gaaon mein wahshat naach uthi, har shaher mein jungle phael gaya.  The sketch he draws of war and helplessness is wrenching. It would take a long mail to recite the complete poem, I will just give some bits from further down.  Iflas zadah dehqanon mein halbel bike, khalyan bike Jeene ki tamnnah ke haaton jeene hi ke sab samaan bike. Kuch bhi na raha jab bikne ko, jismon ki tijarat hone lagi. Quloot mein bhi jo mamnu tha, juloot mein jasarat hone lagi  Then he changes tone again, remember how he describes her coming to meet him before, now see how she come  Tum aa rahi sare aam baal bhikraae Hazar guna malamat ka bar uthaye huye Hawas parast nigahon ki chehra dasti se Badan ki jhempti arnaayiaan chupae huye  Tasawarat ki parchaiyan....  (and listen to this...)  Har ek gaam pe badnamiyon ka jamghat hai Har ek mod pe ruwayion ke mele hain Na dosti, na takkalluf, na dilbari na quloos Kisi ka koi nahin, aaj sab akele hain  (and this one...   Woh rahguzar jo mere dil ki tarah sooni hai Na jaane tum ko kahan leke jane wali hai Tumhe qareed rahe hain zameer ke qatil Ufaq pe khoone tamnnae dil ki lali hai  (again he changes tone...)  Suraj ke lahu mein lithdi hui woh shaam hai ab tak yaad mujhe Chahat ke sunehre khwabon ka anjaam hai ab tak yaad mujhe  (further down a change of tone)  Tum aaj hazaron meel, yahan se door, kahin tanhayi mein Ya bazm e tarb aaraai mein Mere sapne buti hogi bheti aaghosh e parai mein  (See the arrogance that I spoke of.... he refused to believe that anyone could just forget about him him.)  Aur main seene mein gham lekar, din raat mashaqqat karta Jeene ki qatir marta hoon Apne fun ko ruswa karke, aghyaar ka daman bharta hoon  Majboor ho tum, majboor hoon main, majboor ye duniya sari hai Tan ka dukh man pe bhari hai Is daur mein jeene ki qeemat, ya daar o rasan ya qwari hai  Mein daar o rasan tak ja na saka, tun jahad ki had tak aana saki Chaha tha magar apna na saki Hum tum do aisi roohen hain, jo manzil e taskin pana saki  And then Sahir become's indignant, you can almost feel the anger.  Aur aaj jab in pedon ke tale phir do saaye lahrayen hain Phir do dil milne aaye hain Phir zulm ki aandhi uth ti hai, phir jung ke badal chayen hain.  And he goes on to say we must fight it so that the same fate does not repeat.. because...  Guzhishta jung mein ghar hi jale magar is bar Ajab nahi ke ye tanhaiyan bhi jal jaaye Guzhishta jung mein paekar jale magar is bar Ajab nahi ke ye parchaiyan bhi jal jaye  Goodness, how I must have bored you. I am sorry. I wanted to do away with this loneliness and I ended up being a bore.    Maybe one day I will talk about Mir Taqi Mir. There are so many to talk about, if you are so inclined, Sauda, Firaaq, Sayeed Shahidi, Yagaana, Daag to just name a few. And bore you even more.   Take care... and smile always.

      A good book is like an orgasm, thrilling while it lasts.... leaves you a little drained after that.

      "All writers are vain, selfish and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery. Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand. For all one knows that demon is simply the same instinct that makes a baby squall for attention."  by George Orwell  Read this recently at goodreports.net  To give the due where due is due...

      Assertions made but not proved.....  I have been having an ongoing debate with a friend from Australia. Do Creative Writing Schools help?  I have not taken any sides on the subject really, though I have been arguing from the side that they don't. More due to friend's assertions that they do. The matter would have ended in a single e-mail exchange had I agreed.  But do they really help? I gathering of people interested in writing is always valuable, it helps in knowing the different ideas, helps you make up your mind about yours. But other than that, could anyone really teach you how to write a good novel or a short story.   What first is a good opening, a good novel, a good read. Hard to say with the amount of diversity available. Like how Justice Stewart described pornography really. When I read a good opening, I know it. When I read a good book I just know it.  To me a novel, literary fiction and not the genres, has been something that comes from the heart. A novel should be a moan of anguish, a scream of exasperation. A lullaby, a giver of hope. How then do you ask someone to moan in anguish or scream in exasperation? How do you teach a mother to sing a lullaby or a preacher to fill you with hope?  I attended a brief session on Creative Writing lately. What I learnt from there was of little value. Because what was being taught was how to catch an agent's attention, a publisher's eye. All very good, because without that what you are writing might just remain a pile of paper in your cabinet. But are the publishers really looking for just that. If they indeed are, good writers are in great trouble. Innovation would stop and if innovation stops, progress stops as well.    Writing to me has been a purely inward process. I have not found any help outwards for it. But then I would have loved to have a few people with whom I could have debated or conversed about many aspects of writing from time to time. Discuss if A were telling a story of B and C how best to handle the narrative, part first person, part third person. A really diverse debate on that would have done me a lot of good. A collection of people in a writing school then might be of help. But if I were asked to share a half done work, a part of a bigger work I would balk, it would be akin to having someone examine and critic a single spice that was used in preparing a complex dish.  When a friend asked if I would mind sending him the first and second draft of the novel I was writing I had to reply I would. I would be almost like strolling in a shopping mall with your fly unzipped.   Any thoughts on this, anyone?

      Here I am, peeping out of the hole, after a good fifteen year hiatus from writing. Just beginning to find my footing, just beginning to enjoy the idea of parsing words, when I get a few remarks, earlier in the comments box and a few in the e-mail, that make writing worthwhile. For what is the fun in writing, in debate, if there is no little indignation added to it.  What is debate if all agree upon. For the best of the discourses have come in reply to the fools.  Amardeep, Sardarji, if its you - who I think it is, for who do I know that would defend Blake with such vigor - I will visit Blake again at a later date. I have heard you have a blog of your own, do send me the address. Your asking me to translate some Urdu poets, I am not that good at either language, but maybe at some later date I will try to express something on Urdu poets who somehow remain unheard of, like Daag, Josh, Sahir, Shaukat, Akbar Allahbadi. But now I have to wave my Jalur Gemilang, tilt it, at the windmills of those that think there is but one aspect to love.   One wrote: in comments and e-mail too. That my attempt at the last post was but a crass try at wooing a girl. For first of all it presupposes that the object of my desire, as he puts it, is one of fairer sex. I made no mention of the sex, I am sure. But even then...  To ye whose blood has coagulated in the waist!  I have two fold answer. First that not all men think that sex is everything. Yes before you rejoin with 'sure, it is Everything' my reply to that is No! It is just a spoke in the wheel of life. The are many, a majority indeed, who would see a picture of Angelina Jolie and salivate, I would too. But should they be offered the soufflé of Anglina, they would probably say: No thanks, my dear, but I prefer my Nasi Lemak back home. That was awfully nice of you Ma'am, but no, thank you. Now the argument would that if there are such persons, and in majority at that, why haven't we heard of it. But that precisely is the reason, They are not heard from, unlike the ones that go from a soiled bed sheet to another soiled bed sheet. Sometimes even when their loins have lost their steam and their thighs have lost their clutch.  Then there is love, Kris. And love, darling, is a many splendoured thing. You have love for a lover, parent, a sibling and a friend. All in different ways. So when I talked of the friend, I meant a friend. Try it sometimes, Kris. Make a friend of the opposite sex, remove from your thoughts all notions of lust and desire and want. Just be a friend. And you will find a relationship that surpasses all that you ever imagined. Demand nothing of her, Kris. Preach nothing to her, be there if she needs you just fade away when you are not needed. And Kris, it will be that you will soon have one for yourself in her. A friend you may not see or talk to or have contact with, but one you know exists.  But Kris, before you do any such thing, exercise a little, let the blood flow to other natural places it is supposed to flow into, like the head. Yours has found home in your waist. That my friend is good for a short period of time, not always.  Anyway, this is the last time I am going to be drawn into replying any ill suggestive comments. I am sure I could use my time better otherwise...

      There was pricking in the eye and suffocation (of mortification) in the throat.  Imagine yourself in that position, a flint in the eye and at the same time a morsel stuck in your throat........  The words from a sermon in Nahjul Balagha, just remembred.

      My past is snippets, snatches (not the slang, exactly what it means), pieces of remembered verse. My life is a legion of fragments, sometimes inconsequential, mostly inconsequential. My life is like a pebble in my shoe.  My work is inconsequential, creating Baconian art. My writing is meaningless, my poetry just words strung together to mean nothing. For fools to look at and mock.
