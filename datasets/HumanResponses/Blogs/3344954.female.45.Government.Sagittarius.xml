      March 1, 2003  The day I signed the lease on my new Chrysler PT Cruiser. A day that shall live on infamy, at least in my house.   It's a cute car. It's beige. No, pardon me, it's "light almond metallic." It has a sunroof. It has a leather interior, nice stereo with decent speakers, all the accoutrements that come with the Limited Edition. A couple of niceties that I really liked - that extra rubber around the door, preventing dings. The rain guard over the windows. I loved the versatility of the seats. This car was a big downsize for me. I drove a minivan since 1990, followed by my first American car, the Dodge Durango. Leased that one for two years, then got the Cruiser.   Back to March 1. Car dealers. Palm Beach Chrysler Jeep in West Palm Beach, Florida, who has since gone out of business.&nbsp; Interesting turn of events, but I digress.  We weren't 100%&nbsp;sure we wanted the car, but they did everything but backflips to get us to sign, and eventually we did. Drove the new car home. It was a longish ride - a good 45 minutes or so. As we were pulling into our development, someone was pulling out. They honked as they passed us. We opened the window, and they told us our rear tire was flat. Like a pancake. We pulled into the driveway, and sure enough, it was. It left black marks in my driveway.   The salesman had told us that it came with emergency road service, as had my Dodge Durango. So I called the dealer, told them my brand new car had a flat tire, and the salesman told me to call road service. When I did, I was told I would have to pay for someone to come out and change the tire. It turns out the road service package had changed from the plan I had gotten with my Durango. The only time it was usable was when the car wasn't driveable due to a warranty problem. Tires were not considered warranty problem, even though the car had only 35 miles or so on it.   Called back the salesman who insisted that the car was covered by the road service. He passed me along to the sales manager who also insisted. I forced them to open the book that they provide to their customers and read the page about tires. They were shocked, SHOCKED I tell you, to learn that the road service package they were selling didn't cover anything short of a nuclear attack on the car.   My husband put the spare on for me and I drove back to the dealer. Turns out that when they took delivery of the vehicle, they forgot to inflate the tires. Those trucks that you see with all the shiny new cars on them? They deflate the tires when they load them on, the receiving dealer is supposed to reinflate them upon delivery. Oops. They forgot. They replaced the tire and and sent me on my way.   I should have taken that as a sign. An omen. A presage of disasters to come. I did have three days to get out of my contract, but did I? Nope. So everything that happened after that is my own fault, right? Well...no, I don't think so.   So, what happened next? Read on...

      Chrysler Recalls PT Cruiser  June 4 - More than 438,000 PT Cruisers have been recalled by Chrysler.   Federal Safety Regulators said today that power steering fluid leaks could cause fires in the engine compartment.   A Chrysler spokeswoman said there have been 9 reports of that type of fire apparently caused by the problem, but the likelihood of fires is very low, and no injuries or deaths have been reported.   The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has identified the 2001-2004 model years as those affected by the recall.   The recall is a blow to Chrysler's recent claims of improved quality. Chrysler is a division of Daimler-Chrysler.     urlLink Chrysler Recalls PT Cruiser

      July 10, 2004  It was time to look into the lemon law.  Apparently my car fit all the criteria, twice over.  But when I read the lemon law book, it said I couldn't use the form in that book but I had to use the form in the Florida Lemon Law book which I was supposed to have been provided.  But I didn't have one.  Called the dealer.  They had one for me.  Went back there, picked it up.  The first page was supposed to be filled out when I purchased the car.   The dealer must have forgotten.  Oops.  Filled out the form.  Description of continuing defect(s) or condition(s):   Sunroof works intermittently & there's a problem in the electrical system (battery, starter, starter relay).  Mailed it off to Chrysler, registered mail as required.  The postal worker inquired whether I would prefer certified mail as it is significantly less expensive.  But for some reason the state of Florida requires registered mail - $9.62, rather pricey.  But worth every penny if it gets me out of this car. Mailed off a copy to the Florida Attorney General, regular mail, as required.  Got back a receipt saying they received it.  July 21, 2004 Got a call from Chrysler.  They asked if the car was still having problems.  I told them I wasn't using it.  My son is home from college for the summer.  He got a summer internship at the same company my husband works at, and they've been carpooling all summer so I've been using his car.  I told her I'm afraid to use the car.  I told her I had a 70 year old mother who is not well that I have to drive occasionally, and she gets very upset when the car won't start.  I told her I have an 11 year old daughter and I can't be having her bake in the 95 degree heat for an hour or more while I wait for a tow truck.  I told her I don't want to use the car because it keeps breaking, and as long as I have another vehicle at my disposal I'm not going to use it.  I put 28 miles on the Cruiser this summer, and that was going back and forth to the dealer. The lady from Chrysler said I had to use it because the way this lemon law works is after it's reported, I have to have another problem with the car - at that time, they (Chrysler) makes a final inspection and repair attempt.  If I have another problem after that, then they replace the car.  And she said all that has to happen within 26 months of date of purchase.   I told her my son was going back to school in a few weeks in his ten year old Mitsubishi Galant with 92,000 miles on it that has not had one problem all summer, and at that time I would get back in my 16 month old Chrysler PT Cruiser with 16,000 miles on it, a few hundred of which are from going back and forth to the dealer for repairs, and not one moment sooner.  A week later I received a letter from Chrysler, certified mail, return receipt.  Only cost them $4 and change.  Wonder why they don't have to send it registered mail?  Anyway, it said: "Per our conversation, it is my understanding that currently you do not have any concerns with your vehicle.  Should any concerns arise, please call me immediately at ... so an inspection/repair may be undertaken at that time." Apparently me saying I was afraid to drive the damn car led him to understand I had no "concerns."  Interesting interpretation, albeit not entirely unexpected.  I wonder if I should bother replying...nah, my son is leaving in a couple of weeks and I have the utmost faith that my car will have a problem sometime in the few weeks after that.  And the saga continues...

      June 29, 2004   Tried to start my car and got the clicks again.&nbsp; Car towed in again.&nbsp; This time they replaced the relay for the starter.&nbsp;   I'm no gear head.&nbsp; I am not a car person - I don't drool over sports cars, I don't go to car shows.&nbsp; All I want is a car that will get me where I'm going.&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; And apparently that is way more than this Chrysler can provide.   July 2004   Had a day off and decided to bring in the car to see if they could take care of the recall problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way there I opened the sunroof.&nbsp; It opened halfway and stopped.&nbsp; Uh oh.&nbsp; Been there, done that.&nbsp; Had to push the button 512 times to get it to close again.&nbsp; Good thing I was on my way to the dealer.   They had heard about the recall but only through the media.&nbsp; Still no official word from Chrysler, no parts, no instructions on how to take care of it.&nbsp; But they did know how to fix my sunroof.&nbsp; They rented me a car for the day, or so they told me.&nbsp; They said they were replacing the entire sunroof assembly.&nbsp; They had to order parts.&nbsp; I was in the rental for five days.&nbsp; Oh yeah, besides getting me where I want to go, I also want a car with power locks and windows.&nbsp; What can I say, I'm spoiled.&nbsp; The rental had neither.&nbsp;

      Ah, February.  A beautiful month to spend at the car dealer.  February 17, 2004 The damn glove box wouldn't close unless I slammed it repeatedly.  It was getting annoying, but I wouldn't bring the car in for just that.  And then I went to close the sunroof and nothing happened.  I pushed the button again and it moved a fraction of an inch.  Kept pushing, it kept moving a tiny bit at a time.  After thirty or fifty pushes, it finally closed and my upper arm had it's workout for the day.  Oh, and the car felt like it was pulling to the left...  Time to visit my pal Patty Lee.  She was kind enough to rent me a car for the day.  Here's what they said after keeping my car all day:  Couldn't find anything wrong with the glove box latch.  The sunroof?  No problem found.  The pulling problem was caused by a "rotational tire pull" corrected by rotating the tires.  I'm starting to wonder about the tires on this car, maybe more damage was done by the underinflation on purchase day than I realized...  May 3, 2003 Had a couple of good months, lulling me into a false sense of security. Other than one trip in when the "check engine light" came on again.  I had to get to work so my husband brought the car in for me.  Patty looked at it, tightened the gas cap and reset the switch, no paperwork involved and he was out of there in fifteen minutes.  Nobody told him he didn't have enough gas in there.  Nobody told him he didn't click the gas cap enough times.  A freakin' miracle.  Funny how differently they treat a man...but back to May 3.  The "check engine light" came on  again .  This time when I went in, Patty was gone, run off with a man or some such story.  I met her replacement, Kyle, who was totally disinterested in me, my car, or apparently, his job.  I told him in no uncertain terms that I did not want to be coming back on a regular basis for this same problem.  I told him to FIX whatever it was that keeps setting this sensor off.  He was completely unresponsive so I reiterated, rather loudly, I'm afraid.  Several hours later I was told that they replaced the leak detection pump and the natural vacuum detector.  I was beginning to get hopeful that I wouldn't have to come back for a while...  May 6, 2004 A "while" is a relative thing, I suppose, and in my case, it lasted three whole days.  The sunroof stopped working again.  And the A/C was making whining noises.  And the fan motor was making funny noises.  I thought maybe they dropped a screw in there or something.  Back to the dealer, and what the hell, as long as I'm there let's do the 15,000 mile service too.  I do take care of my car...  So, they rented me a car, which was very nice.  But they couldn't find any whining in the A/C.  They couldn't find any funny noises from the fan motor.  They did find a problem with the sunroof this time, and replaced the power sunroof assembly motor, the message center/traveler/temperature module, and the overhead console module.  I thought great, they found the problem, now I'm done.  Bye bye!  May 12, 2004 What's that you say?  How is this possible? Less than a week later I'm back in the shop again?  Read on...  Get in my car in the morning to go to work and...nothing.  The car won't start.  Won't turn over.  Nothing but clicks.  Hmmm, been there, done that, FIXED that, or so I thought.  Towed it in again.  This time they said that the starteer shorted out and they replaced it.  Yippee!  Got my car back.  All is good in my world...  May 14, 2004 No way.  Come on, I hear you saying it.  YES, WAY.  Went to pick up my mom to go look at places for my daughter's bat mitzvah.  My almost-70-year-old mom (sorry, Mom).  Get back in the car and guess what.  It no start.  Just click. Click.  Click.  My mother, ever so helpful, says maybe you're doing it wrong.  I dunno, maybe I was.  But it's the only way I know how to start a car.  You stick the key in and turn.  So I called my husband, totally out of patience.  I begged him to come wait with the car while we went out in my mom's beautiful Infiniti that never has a problem.  He did, and Chrysler towed it back to the dealer.  But when it came off the tow truck, it started right up.  They said they "inspected with tech and service manager all connections and started also battery check out fine no repairs needed."  May 23, 2004 Car pulling again.  Time to rotate the tires again.  Is this normal?

      Last month - June 4th to be precise, I posted about the recall on this car.  It was in all the newspapers, the wire services had the story, etc.  Yet my Chrysler dealer doesn't know anything about it.  Well, sure, they heard there was a recall, but there hasn't been any official notification yet.  Which is true, I never received a notice from Chrysler.  But the dealer hadn't received instructions and/or parts to fix whatever problem there is.  I guess it will take a few more fires under the hoods of some of these cars to light a fire under Chrysler's ass...

      After the tire debacle, I had a few good months, but then it was downhill after that.  June 16, 2003 The air conditioner, which is  critical  in south Florida in June, started making some funky noises.  Took it in to the dealer - there was foam in the blower.  They (the service writer - Harry) told me it's part of the packing they do for shipping the car.  They must have missed a piece when they put the car out for sale.  Oops.    No date, but sometime during the fall of 2003... "Check engine light" came on and I drove directly to the dealer.  They told me it was because I let the gas tank drop to below quarter of a tank.  Huh?  Since when is that a problem?  They also told me that I didn't tighten the gas cap enough - to make sure I tightened the gas cap so it clicked at least three times.  No paperwork involved...  Dec. 5, 2003 The car started pulling to the right, enough that I noticed it.    Oh, the car was pulling because the tires had the wrong air pressure in them.  That would be the air pressure that was set by the Chrysler service department.  December 31, 2003 I always dreamed of spending New Year's Eve at the car dealer.  NOT!  But the "check engine light" came on again.  Went to visit the dealer and was happy to find my old service writer from Dodge had moved in - Patty Lee, a female service writer who didn't automatically assume anyone with boobs didn't have a brain.  She was always a pleasure to deal with at Dodge, and I was delighted to see her again.  Who knew she was going to become my new best friend...  The technician's story: "engine light w drb system had dtcp0440 condition is intermitten.  erase dtc and road test vehicle ok at this time" Whatever that means.  I did understand the "OK at this time" though; or so I thought.  Apparently "this time" means at this very moment and not five minutes from now or tomorrow or any other time soon...  This time the car had 3/4 of a tank so it couldn't be the lack of gas). But I was told the gas cap wasn't tightened enough - it had to click at least  five  times...  I checked the lovely lighted mirror on the way home.  I absolutely did not have "idiot" stamped on my forehead...     February 10, 2004 It's a new year and I didn't have to visit the dealer for over a month.  They must have missed me...  Walked out the door to go to work and the car wouldn't start.  Checked to see if I left the lights on but nope, wait a minute - the keyless ignition worked.  The lights came on when I opened the door.  This was strange.  Not only wouldn't the car start, it wouldn't even turn over.  All I got was a click when I turned the key in the ignition.  Called my own road service - after the tire debacle I was pretty sure nothing less than a nuclear attack on my car would let the Chrysler road service kick in.  A van showed up to jump my car.  It would start when hooked up to the jumper cables, but when the cables came off, the car died.  They pulled out a battery tester and said the battery was fine, it must be something in the electrical system.  They sent a tow truck out.  A guy shows up with a woman in the cab with him.  It's now right before lunch.  He towed the car into the dealer - luckily, I didn't want to go with him because there wouldn't have been any room for me...  This gets really fun.  The dealer is about 9 miles from my house.  I got a ride into work and by early afternoon I called to see if they looked at my car.  Not only hadn't they looked at my car, they said it was never delivered.  I called the road service company who called the tow driver.  He said he delivered it around 1 pm (it took him 2 hours to go 9 miles!) and left the keys at the service desk.  I called back the dealer and they denied receiving the car.  They asked who he left the keys with.  Called back the road service company who conference-called the tow driver with me.  I asked him who he gave the keys to and he said, with considerable attitude, that he was not required to get a name and he hung up.  Conference- called the dealer. Got hold of Patty Lee, service writer extraordinaire.  Half an hour later she called back.  She literally had to walk the entire lot before she finally the found the car where the tow guy dumped it, with the keys on the seat.  Now it really gets interesting.  The mechanic says he tested the battery and it wouldn't hold a charge so they replaced the battery.  Yet when the road service company tested the battery a few hours earlier they said it was fine.  And since when is a battery covered under warranty on a car with over 11,000 miles on it?  I found that odd but the car was running so home I went.  Til the next time...

      July 30, 2004  My first weekday off and I had a bunch of errands to do.  It was a beautiful day so I decided to use the Cruiser, open the sunroof and enjoy the good weather.  Had an appointment to get my nails done and I stopped off at the Starbucks in the next shopping center over to get a latte to bring along.  Got back in my car and...you guessed it.  Nothing.  It wouldn't start.  Called the dealer and told them it would be coming in.   Called Chrysler road service for a tow.  Same guy towed it in once before.  He says he tows in a P.T. Cruiser almost every day.  Hmmm.  Called the Chrysler lemon law guy to report the problem so they can do their "final repair and inspection."  I got voicemail saying he would be out of the office until Monday, August 2.  Except I was flying to NY on Monday, August 2 and wouldn't be back for a week.  So I left a message asking for an email back on the status of the car.  I got a call later the same day from a woman who was checking his messages.  She said she would send someone out.  Called the dealer and asked them to call when the car showed up.  Let them know Chrysler would be doing their thing and that I would be out of town and they would have to keep my car unless they got this all taken care of, the inspection and repair, by Saturday.  Which wasn't going to happen, and didn't happen.  Called the dealer a few times from NY, trying to find out if Chrysler ever did the inspection because they never notified me.  I finally found out on Friday, (one week later!) that the car was repaired and ready for pick up but they couldn't tell me if it had been inspected.  Andy, the service writer, promised me to call me back on Saturday and let me know.  Did you hear my phone ring?  Because I sure didn't.  Tomorrow I go pick it up.  I guess I'll just drive it until it dies again and see how this lemon law really works.  Stay tuned...
