      Basic Stats Name: Heero Yuy Real Name: Unknown (NOT Odin Lowe Jr.)Age:15 (Start of TV series)Ethnic Origin: Japanese Origin: L-1 colony cluster Eye Color: Prussian Blue Hair color: Moss Green/Dark BrownHeight: 156 cm Weight: 44kg Known living relatives: Unknown Gundam(s) Wing Gundam, Wing Gundam Zero Talents/Hobbies Top-notch fighter, pilot, assassin, and hacker. Personality Heero is very hard to fathom when it comes to his personality. At the start of the series, he seems very cold, unemotional, suicidal, anti-social, and totally dedicated to his mission. Nothing will get in his way and survive. But as Docter J once said, "he's really a kind-hearted young boy." But he never lets it show, except for small, rare, subtle hints. He has also taken a strong hold on the last piece of advice given to him by his father-figure, Odin Lowe. "Do as your heart tells you. That's the right path.." This is what Heero later passes on to Trowa: "Do as your heat tells you."* A very important and key line to the gentler pysche of Codename Heero Yuy. Later on in the series, Heero starts a slow but undeniable and astounding change in character. He reacts to people in a more understanding manner, even though Relena still confuses him at times. This change seems to start around the time he self-destructs in Siberia; after recovering, Heero seems 'born again'. He sees life as holding perhaps a bit more meaning. Although he still considers his own life to be devoid of meaning for quite some time. His slightly more social and caring attitude comes through in forms such as his later-on devotion to looking after Relena, less caustic nature (still not saying much) around the other pilots, like Duo, and his gentle-yet-firm 'coaching' of Quatre into leading the Gundams at the final series of battles with the ZERO System.Finally, at the end of the series, Heero screams out that he will survive this fight. An amazing revelation, considering he has, since BEFORE he came to Earth, been trying to seek death. What an amazing 180° turn. In the run-in covered * I'm referring to the line "Follow your emotions." That line is NOT the true translation; just another anime dub blooper. The original line is much closer to "Do as your heart tells you." Psychologically speaking, there IS a difference. Pre-AC 195 History With nary even a name to be called for his childhood, the boy who would be Heero Yuy remains a mystery. The earliest back we know of him is A.C. 188, when Heero is 8 years old. At this time he was in the care of an assassin of no small amount of infamy, Odin Lowe, killer of the first Heero Yuy. How Heero came to be under Odin Lowe's wing, it's uncertain, but it's apparent that Odin had raised Heero from a very early age — teaching the boy to wield a gun during a camping trip (on Earth?) when Heero was scarce past being a toddler — 4 or 5 years old, perhaps.Odin's treatment of Heero, while being somewhat gruff and detached, was very much fatherly; perhaps a means of atonement for his crimes, though he still raised the boy with the qualities and skills of a professional assassin. Still, there's no proof that he even had a name for Heero throughout the years he watched over the boy. The fandom rumor that Heero is actually Odin Lowe Junior has no basis in reality. (Well, Episode Zero reality... of course Gundam Wing's real, you idiots! ... ::sweatdrop::) When Heero was 8, he parted ways with Odin Lowe as the man was killed during his last assassination attempt and means of atonement. After a somewhat sentimental last few words, Heero left Odin's corpse behind in the burning Alliance base and walked out into the rain. Some time later, after somehow getting a hold of what would become his trademark tanktop and spandex outfit, nameless little Heero happened across an old man huddled in an alleyway; Dr. J. The doctor casually remarked that Heero had good eyes; would he mind becoming a Gundam pilot? Remembering Odin's parting advice, to do as your heart tells you, Heero agreed.Heero's training from that point on remains a mystery. (ALL DATA IN THIS SECTION IS FROM RELENA'S EPISODE ZERO. IT IS STRONGLY HINTED THAT HEERO IS INDEED THE NAMELESS LITTLE BOY THAT RELENA HAPPENS ACROSS. IN THE OFFICIAL TRANSLATION, IT'S SAID THAT THERE IS NO RECORD OF HEERO EVER HAVING BEEN ON EARTH BEFORE OPERATION METEOR. WELL, WHY WOULD THERE BE RECORD? HE WAS NAMELESS and PART OF AN UNDERGROUND TERRORIST ASSOCIATION!)Three years after happening across Dr. J, 11 year old Heero — currently codename Black Alpha — was sent to the JAP point on Earth, to the St. Gabriel Institute. Here his mission was apparently reconnaissance for a fall-back position for refuge for members of his terrorist organization during a strike operation on a nearby Alliance base. His top two choices turned out to be St. Gabriel itself, and the Darlian estate. It was during this time that he bumped into — literally — Relena Darlian for the first time. However, as soon as the terrorist attack was foiled and all those fighting were driven out or killed, Black Alpha vanished again, much to a young Relena's dismay.(BACK TO THE STORYLINE 100% HEERO YUY GUARANTEED...) About a year before Operation Meteor was scheduled, Heero was ordered to destroy a military base on one of the colonies.

      Basic Stats Name: VashOther/Nicknames: Vash the Stampede, the Humanoid Typhoon, Ericks*, Needle-noggin/TongariSpecies: Plant angel - "those who are beyond time"Age:130 (Start of TV series)Origin: Unknown Eye Color: AquamarineHair color: Straw-goldHeight: ((In Puff magazine Nightow says 180cm, 5'9" - prolly in ref to manga. Screenshot of a form Vash filled out in ep 10 says 7'20" --- Um, how about 72 inches - 6'0"? Take your pick.)) Known living relatives: Millions Knives (brother), refers to all plants we see as siblings/"little sister" -- the Colt guns Knives made are called "bretheren". * Ericks sounds like Alex, which is 1) the name of Rem's deceased boyfriend (::glare:: don't make me consider any evil Freudian theories), and 2) ....Alexander means "protector of mankind". Fitting, no? Creator Comments: (Yasuhiro Nightow, Puff Magazine) Height: "It isn't set. About 180 centimeters, more or less, I guess."Name origins: "'Stampede' is his nickname or common name. It means 'cattle running wild.'"Weight of coat: "It isn't set. For all that there's lots of stuff attached, it might be lighter than you think."Eyesight: "I think it's quite good. And his motion perception is good, too. That, plus his sense of judgement in emergency situations, and lightning-quick reflexes have kept him alive. He doesn't have super powers or anything."Living expenses: "He works as a bodyguard and stuff like that to earn his keep. He's steady--he doesn't seem like the type to waste money." Dressing time: "I haven't decided that! (cries) He puts that on every day, so he must be pretty fast, right?" Talents/Hobbies Talents: Haphazard if good acrobat, dodging bullets with said acrobatic feats, amazing gunman, good at throwing bullets off their mark from 30' with a few thrown pebbles, and managing to irritate vast numbers of people by simply existing.Hobbies: Donuts, drinking only to get extremely ill and hung-over, playing with children, and light-hearted skirt-chasing that never works. (James T. Kirk he is NOT). Personality Vash the Stampede. The Humanoid Typhoon. The man with $$60,000,000,000 on his head. Mankind's First Official Human Act of God. He’s a blonde who likes playing with children and eating donuts. And he cries. A lot.Vash’s personality is an odd, constantly shifting state of affairs. His true self seems to be that of a kind, very sensitive young man who genuinely loves life, human or animal. He’d risk his own life to save a total stranger’s without a second thought, and would refuse to take the life of someone who wanted his own, a disposition that nearly gets him killed quite often, and is proven by the vast number of scars on his body. Despite the how often he is pushed to the very edge of sanity and dragged through the mire of blackest suffering, Vash devoutly maintains his — Rem's — ideals of "Love & Peace". When he does falter once in those ideals, it tears him apart and leaves him in despair. Life is priceless to Vash, and all life is equal in that exquisite value. It seems almost a mockery for him to claim an occupation as a gunman, and even Vash himself jokes about how he should give it up — but despite the joking, he would love nothing better than to find his Eden and hang up the gun. Eden — "a place where people can live as people". To Vash, violence is a necessary evil that should be used only to combat greater evils. Thus he searches for a place where there is no evil to combat. A place where he can live a simple, nondescript life as a normal human. Pre-Series History Even at square one, Vash's history is blurred and confusing. He is related to the plants - the beings beyond time. How? He and his brother Knives are apparently descended from them, however they call the plants "siblings". Obviously, they have evolved into something different from the original beings beyond time - a bridge between the plants and humans, perhaps - but how that relationship is defined is uncertain. What is certain is that he and Knives were born, looking like newborn humans, in a tubelike structure onboard a SEEDS ship, presumably a lightbulb-like structure similar to that which normal Plants inhabit. All but one of the crew onboard the ship wanted to destroy the unexpected non-humans, but that one, Rem Saverem, pleaded that their lives be spared.Rem and the ship's captain, Joey, then took on the responsibility of taking care of and teaching the two fast-growing Plants. And grow quickly they did - aging apparently eight years in one. This, combined with their astronomical intelligence, started to grow fear in one of the crew, Steve. Unfortunately, fear in one such as him blossoms into hatred. Thus Steve began to harass and, in cases (Knives for certain, possibly Vash) beat the brothers. Vash reacted to this with tears and confusion, but ultimately seemed to accept it. It hurt him greatly, but he never displayed any want to return that hurt, or even the hatred. Even at Steve's trial where he was sentenced to be put in cryogenic sleep, Vash appeared distraught. This attributes of his personality seem to be inherent, but also greatly cultivated and indelibly ingrained by frequent talks with Rem. During this time together, there was one such talk when he was very young where Rem introduced Vash to a flower; the red geranium, her favorite. She explained it to him as being, in the language of flowers, the symbol for determination. This later became the reason why he chose to continually wear his trademark bright red coat.Rem, because of her close, motherly bond with him, became to Vash the central goddess of his religion/philosophy. She was everything his world revolved around, like so many other little children in view of their parents. But it all came crashing down when his brother Knives responded a bit differently to the humans. He believed in returning tit for tat, and then some. Thus Knives orchestrated the killing of all of the crew save Rem, and programmed all the human-carrying SEEDS ships to crash on the planet below they had been orbiting around. Rem, however, decided at the last moment to stay behind and try to save the ships. Vash, incoherent and sobbing, pleaded with her to come with them on the escape pod, but fell silent when she said her last words: "Vash, take care of Knives."She (presumably) died soon after when the ship exploded, but not before she succeeded in changing the course of the ships. It didn't console Vash, who was pulled out of his inconsolable wailing when he heard Knives laugh. Finding out that Knives had planned it all out, Vash reacted with rage; leaping at his brother and attacking blindly. Knives, however, dispatched Vash easily, and he remained in a corner crying quietly presumably for the rest of the voyage.Soon they crashed down on the planet like so many other of the ships, and Vash woke from the hit to find Knives offering to help him up. Knives was overjoyed that he had suceeded--partially, at least. Some human ships survived the crash, thanks to Rem's intervention. Vash was furious, and said that Knives was a murderer; not human! For daring to compare him to human's, Knives kicked and beat Vash then, before leaving him bruised on the sands, whimpering Rem's name quietly.Later, while traveling, the two brothers debated the fate of the humans on the desert planet, and Vash made the point that they'd be able to survive, as long as they had the plants. Knives said this is why he kills people: "I kill spiders to save butterflies. Simple logic." That seemed to strike a furious, smoldering cord in Vash.Presumbly later that night, Vash approached a sleeping Knives, a rock raised over his head and prepared to smash his brother's skull in. "Remember! He killed them!" But just as he was gearing up for the final blow, he remembered Rem's words that no one has the right to steal another's life. And so he threw the rock harmlessly down to the ground and ran away to a high cliff where he spent the rest of the night, crying. The next morning, he woke up to Knives calling him from down below, and they resumed their journeying as if nothing had happened.A few months later, they arrived at an outpost of humans hiding in the wreckage of one of the ships, and they watched a town being slowly built (we presume they watched). They were there, however, to witness a riot break out as a man broke out of line to rush the few in charge doling out water from the plants. Knives pronounced this the true nature of the human beasts. He then went on to communicate with the plant, and initiate what seems to be an explosion. But Vash stoped him, yelling "What did you do?!" To which Knives answered simply that they had their own free wills now; they were no longer "things" to be used. Vash seemed confused by this. Ten years later, the adult brothers arrived at an abandoned SEEDS ship. Knives, smug, said that he has "found it". Vash asked him what he's going to do, and Knives said he'd come to fetch something he left behind. He left Vash then, telling him to stay put until he returns.One year later... a very lonely Vash, who had been waiting the entire time and was reduced to muttering to himself while huddled in a corner, finally saw Knives again. But this time, his brother was armed with two identical guns, save that one was black and the other silver. Knives announced he was done and then went off into the desert to test one of the gun's--the black one. A very confused Vash was forced to trail behind, questioning Knives to no gain. And then the gun was fired, and it created a huge blue-white sphere that destroyed everything within it. When the sphere had passed, the sky had turned a stormy red. Knives was pleased then, saying it had a 13% output, and then told Vash this was how they'd wipe out mankind. Vash was.. less than thrilled. Knives tried to make him take the silver gun, then, but Vash refused, and a few minutes later, he tackled Knives to the ground and a fight broke out for control of those guns. It ended when Knives got to the black one before Vash got to his, and he aimed it directly at his brother. But Knives still didn't seem to think there was anything really wrong between them, and lowered his gun. Vash, however, grabbed up the silver gun then and aimed it at Knives, and after his brother taunted him for a moment.. Vash fired, and shot Knives in the thigh. Knives was stunned, hurt deeply, and screaming at Vash. Vash, distraught at what he had done, screamed and ran off, leaving his bleeding, traumatized brother behind and crying out to him to come back. But when he left, he took both of the guns with him. Vash wandered the desert for two years after that incident, until finally, disheveled and staggering, he collapsed in the sands, whispering Rem's name before passing out. He woke up later in a technologically advanced sickbay, where several attendants and a smiling young Doctor (same from episodes 20-21?) were watching over him. He'd been taken up to the Flying Ship, the last of the SEEDS ships that had remained in orbit in the planet's atmosphere. Vash had fun there in the days/months/years (it's unknown) he was there, until he finally left, equipped now with his trademark red coat. He wandered the planet then, living the life of the carefree gunman we know and love so well.Eighty years later still, he was back at the SEEDS ship. With an older doctor (certainly the same now from eps 20-21) and young Brad in the background and a young Jessica at his feet, Vash was going through the records of the people who had come from earth in the ships. Much to his surprise, he found the records of a man related to Rem! Revnunt Buskus, governor of July city**. Overjoyed, Vash decided to go see this man and tell him about Rem.Arriving in July City, Vash was horrified to find the governor recently killed and lying in his own blood. Knives was waiting there for him, too. Knives's only excuse was that now Vash would have nothing left to tie him to Rem. Knives lectures him then, saying he is the proof of human folly. Why can't he see it that way? But what's the good; why grow at all if you only grow to be more sentimental? Knives pulled a gun on Vash then, to which Vash responded by aiming both Colts, the guns Knives had made, at his brother. But Knives was faster this time, and shot Vash. Only his shot took off Vash's entire left arm--the arm that had been holding the black Colt. With a snap of his fingers, Knives then triggered the Angel Arm sequence in Vash with the intent to force his brother to dispose of the humans there---only semi-coherent, in-pain Vash had no idea what was going on, and only knew it was as scary and hurt like hell. But he was coherent enough to do one thing---aim the transforming gun at Knives. "Are you really going to shoot me again ... VASH?!" And so Vash did. Before the Angel Arm was fully formed, he fired at Knives, hitting him straight in the abdomen. But the Angel Arm created a terrible sphere of destruction like when Knives had fired the black gun before; the sky turned red, and the entire city, one of the Seven Major Cities, was completely destroyed. But no humans died as a direct cause of the gun: the millions only started to die later from exposure, and turning on one another in desperation.When he recovered and found himself alone in the rubble.. Vash... remembered nothing.With only the memories from before the July incident, he went on with his life as before: a wandering gunman, keeping in loose contact with his "family" on the orbiting SEEDS ship. But he had a new focus now, too: to find Knives, who he could only guess as being the ultimate cause for July. His brother, who was also now more dangerous... because when Vash had woken in the ruined July, the black Colt had been taken, and Knives now possessed that, even if he was now too injured to use it... for now. And so Vash vowed to find Knives.. and stop him, no matter what that might take.
