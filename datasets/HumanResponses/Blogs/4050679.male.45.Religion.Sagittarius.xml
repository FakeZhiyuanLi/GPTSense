      I had a wedding rehearsal tonight. The bride seemed fine all the way through the practice. Afterwards, though, she appeared to be nervous. I asked her about it and she confirmed my suspicions. "Why is that," I asked. "I'm afraid he will change." I thought for a moment and then nodded my head. "You're right, he will change ... but so will you. And if you want the marriage to continue to be what it is right now, you will need to change together. Keep the lines of communication open always!" She seemed a bit stunned that I would suggest, on the eve of her most happy moment, that it would not always be like this. But then agreed: the only thing unchanging is constant change.  After the practice, I thought about my marriage of 25 years. Oh, how different I am now than then. The sameis true with my wife, Kim. We've been through a bunchtogether, and it's not over yet. I still love her as much as the day we were wed. No, more than that. It's not the giddy, goose-pimpley love I remember. It's more of a deep, glowing ember love that contains the ever-present promise of passion; waiting for a breath to stir it to flame. I've come to be as comfortable with it as my own skin. But I never take it for granted. I'm sure it seems that way to Kim occasionally, for I'm not the most romantic guy in the world. (Actually, I'm probably not in the top 40%, a shameful admission).  Ahh, but who knows...maybe I'll change. The only constant is change, right?

               When going by John's place, he reminded me of a great book I had to read for Summer classes this year. The name is   Codependent No More   by Melody Beatty. It was required for our pastoral care class to alert us to the dangers of emotional entanglements involved in pastoral care. But all of the students saw bits and pieces of themselves in the chapters. I suppose this brings out the societal nature of us humans; we are all codependent on each other to some degree.                    But as the chapters flew by, I saw little bits here and there that freed me up quite a bit. I am only responsible for my actions and no one else's. I may try to help here and there, but ultimately, the responsibility to change belongs to that person. And there is nothing you can do about it. As a pastor, my hope is to change the world in some way. What I realize now is that the world must want to change first. Oh, I'll be there offering to help (in my little corner if it) when it asks, but I can't force it. It's a hard concept for some to grasp, or at least it was for me. I'm one of those whose identity was wrapped up in helping everyone but me. It feels selfish sometimes, and just a little scary only being me. But there is also a great freedom that comes with it. One I can't describe except to say, a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.                I believe this will help me in my professional career as a pastor too. That should be a given as the church exists in the minds of many to change the world. No, the church exists to witness to God and be a place of learning and sanctuary. Hmmm, I'm getting off the subject a little here and I haven't quite thought this out totally. But it sounds right so far. I'd better sign off now and think about this.

       Ever heard that before? Well, the things that follow me home are thoughts of what I was studying and events that happened. One of them followed me to church tonight for our Bible Study. I was working through the 12th chapter of Acts and somehow we got on the subject of church authority. Where does it lie, with the leaders of the church or with the body of the church. Then we discussed the different forms of church government and personal preference.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It was then I hit them with a left curve; do you really pick your&nbsp;church? Or, does it depend on your ability to accept grace freely from God? Those who believe&nbsp;grace is a free gift of God believe there is nothing we can do to improve ourselves in relation to&nbsp;God.&nbsp;Some who believe grace comes from God, but with varying degrees of human effort worked in, feel we do take an active role in imporving our relationship with God.  &nbsp;  Now we tie that in with the different nature of people. Some, who have self-esteem issues will have a difficult time accepting free grace, believing they have to do something to earn the love of God.&nbsp;Others, who have an adequate (or overly adequate) amount of self esteem, may&nbsp;have no&nbsp;trouble&nbsp;accepting grace as a free&nbsp;gift from a loving God. Could this be what draws people to their particular denominations instead of who they were born to or married to? This was the question I asked my teachers. I received no&nbsp;answers, just troubled looks like, "That made sense, but I'm not sure why ... or how."&nbsp;Nice to know I was thinking in the classroom, huh?  &nbsp;  So what would you say to this:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) That is interesting, give me a few months to consider it.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) You're full of it, it's all other stuff.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Who cares, did you catch a Royals game?    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do everyone, it's been a bit but now I'm back for a few more uninterrupted (I hope) months. Thanks for keeping Kim company and for any prayers for safety for me. Except for a self-mutilation at one of the camps, all went okay. Don't have much time to chat now, but will continue very soon.&nbsp;Just wanted to say  Hi ,  Hello  and  Salutations!     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;

      Sorry about the lack of posts lately, it's been a horrendous or busy or both couple of weeks. Some things have gone on at the church that have me considering whether or not my time here is over. Kim seems pretty certain that this is our last year. (She's starting to collect moving boxes.) Guess I'm just too stubborn to admit it quickly. I have a few that say my presence here is still needed. But there is a faction, how large I don't know, that are supposedly unhappy with my performance, and the people I've brought into the church. How sad!!!  The good news is only one person is used as their mouthpiece. So the insinuation of her representing many could, in reality, mean only one or two or a half dozen. But it could be more, maybe even the majority. If that's the case, the congregation is dead and doesn't even know it yet. Worse than that, they are idolatrous in their worship; paying homage to material blessings and external dressings. They will stand in the way of others coming to Christ and I feel sorrow for them, knowing the shame they will face when standing before their Lord. I can't say anymore and probably should have posted this. But I don't really care if it gets out, not anymore. This church doesn't need revival, it needs resurrection ... or a shovel!

        I was looking over a devotional this morning and read of a young woman studying photojournalism. Her grandmother, whom she adored, was one of those who always had a sparkle in her eye like she was always up to something. but she also had curvature of the spine from osteoporosis. She had a major project due for the class and while taking pictures of her wrinkled face, asked if her grandmother would allow her to photograph her bare back, showing the curving effects of the disease. Though a source of embarrasment for the grandmother, she agreed to pose for her granddaughter.  The young lady could tell this was uncomfortable and embarrasing for the older lady. But she also sensed that the grandmother wanted to continue; realizing how important it was to her. The photo shoot continued and drew the two closer together. The granddaughter was not surprised at this, but she was shocked to see the pictures she took. They were not of a suffering old woman, but of a part of the beauty of creation. An older woman, but with qualities that showcased her standing as a child of God. She never imagined they would have come out looking like that.  In one of Jesus' conversations with his disciples, he recites from Isaiah, "they look but do not see, listen but don't hear." He was referring to Israel's leaders not hearing God. But it speaks to us today. We look and listen, yet fail to truly see or hear what is before us. And only because we won't concentrate and focus on the messenger. It's like one of those pictures hidden within a seemingly nonsensical pattern. You stare at it, concentrating deeper and deeper, shifting your focus to see something more, and suddenly it pops out at you. And you wonder why it took you so long to see it. The more I deal with people, the more I wonder why it takes me so long to look past their "nonsence" coverings and see the beauty within. I hope you have a great day and see lots of beautiful sights.
