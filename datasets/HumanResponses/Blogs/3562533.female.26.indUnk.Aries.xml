      FUCK This, that, the other. You, Me, this bullshit. Hope. Love. Faith. Truth. Future. Happiness.   Not having coffee. Mornings in bed. Childhood innocence. Memories. Slow drivers.  Opinions. Silent phones.  What you might say. What you won't say. What you did say. What you could have said. What could have been.  Him and her. Them, all of them. That damn house.   All his lies. All her miseries. Their pompous attitudes. Their good advice. Her not having the strength to stand up. (For God sakes...Stand the Fuck Up!)  Tomorrow and what I won't do.  Chores. Responsibilities. Work. Deadlines. Reasonings. Questions. Common Courtesy. Respect. Sacrifice. Trust.   And You, Baby. Fuck You.

      WHO… ME? Where did I go when I left here because I can’t seem to find my way back and I don’t know where exactly to look for me I’m not sure of where I just went. And what if I’m gone when I get there to that place where I was and then came. And what will I do when I find me I’m sure things won’t be the same. I wonder if I had great adventures when I left and went out on my own. Or did I sit in a corner waiting forever not ever knowing when I’d eventually get there and do you think I should look there? Perhaps I got tired and just went ahead and walked home.

      SLEEP SOUNDLY GENTLE SOUL  Do sleep soundly gentle soul forget in dreams your cries of woe— wake not until mourning sets the sun. Think only what the child knows,  in fields of daisies may you run to the blackness – come undone. In the think of innocence slowly grow beyond those cold stone walls you shun.  At long, at last I set you free, this burden on my breast you carry. Reach the stars I never could. Try not to be as I, so wary. Thank God, you’re no longer a part of me. Escape!  I never would.

      I appreciate your honesty   you sick, silly bastard   who fucked my friend            and left me lonely.   I think ill wishes   but shoot them sideways.   Your fate will be yours alone,   much worse than I could imagine   For once your idiocy will be useful   How lovely!   Enjoy

      RESPONSE  Did I have something between my teeth? Was my hair out of  			place. Were my words too big, too foolish 	a waste of paper, maybe? There were no comments no after class acknowledgments. Just 28 watch—watching lemmings waiting for their dinner bell. I make their world beautiful and they scoff at me.  No wonder so many poets kill themselves.

      “MY LOVE”  Like a thief in the night I steal a glimpse of the master’s gentle hand at work.  With the tip of my finger I follow the rigid cut of  the jaw, mouth, chin.  Pausing upon the lips to caress; with the intimacy of mother and infant  All the while learning, memorizing, abducting— a small piece of him to have as mine alone.  And as a child slowly loses  Innocence, he will never even realize that it is gone.

      I live in a house  I built it myself The walls may not be decorative, But they are sturdy Strong against the elements It is most often times quiet, To the point of  Night and day continuously passing unnoticed. There are small windows Enough light shines through— But as perfected, It is neither too hot or too cold It is perfect Meticulous in form Every detail handcrafted and heartfelt Blood and sweat…but not tears They reside across town From where my bills are forwarded I am proud of my work Though there are those who think it an eyesore Think me crazy  They do not understand the process of construction That which you learn in the act of deconstruction. I live in a house I built it myself The walls may not be decorative But they are sturdy Strong against the elements.

      Do not look at me that way, But do not stop Speak to my silence  And try to understand For a moment…just try  Listen to what I am not saying  What I cannot Will not Reveal to you—a stranger  Although the clouds are thick You do not doubt the moon Have faith that I can shine A mystery to man— But beautiful somehow. Seemingly unreachable But perception can be decieving

      My garden is much like me Everywhere you look—something different grows It’s sporadic and changing Green without bloom No form and no reason Not one portion more beautiful than the next As a whole It’s strangely understandable But just over the fence Something red is in bloom Mocking Color on the skyline And I can see it from my garden It stays in its space Never accidentally spreading color to my world And it seems better somehow More enjoyable More pleasing to the eye I could try to plant those flowers In my garden But they would not grow They would be smothered and hidden  By the ones there before Green on top of green And no one would ever know That something deep down in the madness Had once tried to grow

      THE FEELING IS MUTUAL I know that you don’t like me, but you see I don’t like you either. I never listen to you because 			you 			won’t  			listen 			to me. You huff in deep breath I try, but truly don’t really care what you think. Why do you try to be so rude, make me feel foolish  frown at the waste of your time when you so obviously 			mean so very little to me. Save your breath 							and exhale for someone else. You taint my air and I like you even less.

      MOVE ME  Where I live words cut like ice through the warmth I once had, piercing the  skin, and burning the heart like colored paper.  You melt the ice and set a pleasant fire to my skin searing away the pain that  slashes at my face…hands…heart.  If only I had known the ease in which I would give into your stalking fire, willing to bear the pain for one more moment.  My mother used to sting me with memories of her white picket fence, flowered wallpaper, and the storm.  But here, I can smell the peace in the autumn leaves, see it in the dried corn, taste it in the air; and I am dizzy with it.  Nothing would please me more than to hold that feeling in my cold white hands, and stroke it, keep it, live from it.  These hands.  But everything runs like water through those tiny cracks and crevices leaving these hands empty and dry.  Where I live the words cut like ice killing me slowly, piercing my skin, and watching my heart turn to cinders.

      LIFE 101 She nods and smiles while the learned one talks, as if she is the one who knows all. And I am disgusted by it— disgusted! Oh! God! Why am I disgusted? Then there is that one who is mismatched in mind and body  and talks too much in large words to say very little of nothing. There is no one for her to talk to at home. The disgusting one speaks again. And right here. He sits too close to me and  his hands and shoes wear the same  Earth. Dirt. He is cocky without justification. Is that a tan or a dusting of filth? I’ve heard that voice before. The one that fills the same chair  week after week. The one forgotten, or simply ignored, until the next time—Ahah! Remembered. The disgusting one alleluia’s the preaching. I need a cigarette but that voice in my head,  the one that I live with during the week,  yell No!  softly to my youth. The spirit moves the learned one through flailing arms and babbling tongues. Somewhere in the midst of all those words  is sense. Yes. My posterior is numb from this mechanical resting, going, resting, going, Stop for a minute please, God? I think I dropped my mind a few miles back.

      A LETTER TO A FRIEND IN NEED… 	“I’M LEAVING YOU!”  I’m off to dance amidst the moonbeams; to and fro 1..2..3..1..2..3 dodging mother nature’s guests  on the dried corn adorned ballroom floor. Please don’t ask me for a waltz, my dance card is full. And please, do not try to buy my favors with a song I have listened to this night orchestra too long, not to recognize your requests. It’s probably best if I leave. And if by chance I should see a  				F 				A 				L 				L 				I 				N 				G 				star, 			well then – 			I may wish that I never see you again.

      KISSES  I would pass on any food that didn’t grow out of the Earth. So his eyes wouldn’t fall disapprovingly on my Figure. For years I allowed my hair to grow, as heavy as it was, but Blonde. So he would show me to his friends and brag about his Daughter.  There she stands, without yellow hair, and far from Small. I see her beauty as she quotes Shakespeare and adjusts wired Glasses. Compare the two and tell me who is the better One. At night does she have someone to place soft kisses on her Breasts.

      If I were an artist I would paint you a picture of the beauty hidden behind my eyes— and you would love me.  I would croon to you my feelings  in 70’s bubblegum pop and you would understand.  You would scribble my name on blue lined paper, dark and deep, with uneven hearts.  But all I have are my words and they come only as: “May I take your order?”

      ENOUGH Why must you be so cruel I have done nothing but everything to you. I must remind myself that you are wrong because your words so quickly bruise my  repose. Enough—for a moment May I catch my breath Enough—for a moment May I repatch my shield Can you not welcome silence in. Enough—for God’s sake  enough. I could tear you down  Make you cry Make you doubt I too have a mighty weapon sharp and shiny. Do not make me take it out Do not make me cut you. I could. Enough.

      …ANOTHER MAN’S TREASURE  I crave that pleasure today, but no longer does it exist  in my world.  It was long ago banished from the land—by the loud, yellow ensconced palace guard. I often say, they’ll rue the day they killed the Queen; but the pawn, and rooks, and gentle brooks have forgotten, and I  only a child then, (and now maybe) must recall for all the minstrels far silent song. It was my palace, my passion; and I loved whole hearted and without reservation. With my youth-blind eyes I overlooked the missing puzzle pieces of the tapestry strewn corridor, filling in the time worn gaps with  playful fantasy, and hidden secret colored pictures. I drank the tangy sweet nectar that was offered each visit, from the tall green whispered stemmed goblets; that climbed sleekly through my small hands like  the ivy that ran down the wind chipped gables. I dreamed days away beside the earth filled wishless well, watching the clouds change from monsters, to heroes in the blink of a mind. And in the blink of a mind, I found me chasing the seeds that once sowed themselves. Wondering if there ever was a patch of purple irises, and if the morning ever gloried like it does in that dark  place behind my eyes. The fable changed and there was no one left to climb the  paint flaked lattice—except a slowly wilting rose of mourning. So I plucked it from it’s journey all the while becoming pricked by it’s sprit. For a moment we shared a lifeline, until I pressed it neatly into a  leather bound volume of A Catcher In the Rye and slowly—gently—turned the page.

      A LIGHT FOR THE DARK ROOM  The door is shut, I have gone to the dark room. You will not be there only myself and the haunted past. I am at the point of full disclosure. I must clear my mind and body. Too much.  Too soon. The words have stopped like a damn at a floodgate. I fight to find them as they once were sleeping softly in my brain waiting for my gentle nudge. They slumber elsewhere now. Did someone take them or did I leave the window open? I am afraid of what is to come My body is sick of me and  my soul followed the words trail. I feel nothing and it is a cruel, hard notion. It slaps me in the face and opens my mouth for infinity. I only wish to stop it, but  I haven’t really a care to do so. From where will inspiration spring? Not Love—for I have that. Not Pain—I have that. Not morning, noon or night— Not starry skies, wild oceans, simple pleasures. Not smiling faces, open books blank pages are just pages I have them all. Nothing. I am so angry—inspire me. I must cry—give me something. To all the heavens and their powers I plead No spells or scented candles bring it back Not this time. What have I done Where did I lose that Child that Friend is it truly just someone else’s treasure Deep sleep please find me. Sweet words search my heart Dry pen and fingers fill those empty pages and leave my mind alone. A light for the dark room.

      A CHILD IN VERONA  When once upon a time still once uponed, in fields of endless spring time passion fashion, I happened to cross paths with Magicals’ spawn  in mornings dew and daylights dawn she looked my way, awe struck me wild to meet an innocent woman child. Her hair it was set on gossamer wings hindered by golden fairy sprites, that by chance would dance upon the breeze rendering me a paintless painters insight. Those eyes I will soon not forget  if tomorrow begins forever. I’m a prisoner ensconced in cobalt’s hue an untimely loss in never never. She bid me stay and enjoy the day  with all her charm and wisdom. We would excuse the hours making flower crowns for royalty long lost to here after. Speaking of kings and worldly things, of oceans, motions, and logic; poetic vices, body lices,  knights and ladies endeavored to whom and what and whether. She chilled me, thrilled me with her mind for I was once that young. The world was neither flat nor round but within my hand at my uninhibited commanding demand. I saw it spinning there in her palm held fast by her youthful balm. For her to turn and topsy turv, to spin and wreak and plunder to take, to leave, rejoice, or grieve to cower at her power and no other. Mother Nature feel me smother. She sang a song of love, long lost heartfelt, but not yet heartfelt. She quipped a gibe and laughed besides, never knowing the truth in life’s long strides. I wept, I mourned, and screamed and cried, but before my mouth my feelings died. Holding back the tide of knowing tears daunted by my lengthy years  I left her there long ago. I’ll not soon forget the day if yesterday was the end of never; until once uponed are once uponed and happily ever’s forever.

						   The closing was the most dreaded of home buying experiences. All of my friends, who are already homeowners, warned me of the hours and millions of signatures.   In all actuality, it went rather well. It only took 45 minutes. The people were extremely nice. And, I don't think there were that many papers to sign.  The only one that freaked me out was seeing that my loan would be over in 2034 (won't we all be driving hover crafts and living on the moon by that time). And, if I only make the minimum payments, I will end up paying for my house about four times over, with interest.   But, the closing is of no concern to new home buyers. You are fulfilling a dream and receiving keys to your new home. What could be so bad.   Plan for some kind of celebration after the close and it will go by all that much faster!

						   Before painting, one of the professional tips is to go around all the door/window facings, trim, etc and caulk. This way, when you paint, there are no cracks. Everything looks seamless and it will really make the rooms look better.  So, no big deal. Run a line of caulk around the seams. Smooth it out with your finger. Doesn't sound too difficult, huh?  Well this chore became the BIGGEST pain in the ass of anything I have ever done.   First of all, for those of you virgin caulkers...You cut off the tip of the caulk tube, do this at an angle. It will help tremendously. But...wait. You're not ready to use your caulk yet. For some unknown reasons there is an additional inner seal in the caulk. So, you have to push a big nail, screw, pencil or anything pointy down the hole you've just created and puncture that seal. If you don't, the tube will explode when you put it in the caulk gun and try to use it. EXPERIENCE TALKING HERE!!!  So that was my first homeowners mistake.   And, this shit is sticky. It may be a good professional tip and I did go ahead and finish the rooms with caulk. But it was like icing a cake with my pinky. Sticky, gross, messy and in the end I don't really know how much of a difference this will make. Good luck!

						   So it has all come down to this. Today is the closing on my first home. A single girl, a home of her own. Not what I pictured for myself when I was young...but it will do just fine.   My new home is located within a short stumbling distance of a very popular neighborhood bar.It's 94 years old. Not too big. Pretty perfect for a girl and her cat.   The closing will be at 5PM tonight where I will receive the keys to my new home. I begin painting in the morning and have two weeks to get it to moving in condition.   At that point I will be suckering a big group of friends into moving me! It should be a hoot.

The first thing that needed to be done is for the cordaround (sic) to be pulled away from the wall in the hallway. It was completely rotten. Now it is gone and has to be replaced. Problem is, there is nothing to attach it back to because of the previous rot. A bigger piece of trim will have to be added in order to cover up the damage.

It is at the front of the house, but no one actually ever uses it. Everyone goes to the side. Anyhoo..
